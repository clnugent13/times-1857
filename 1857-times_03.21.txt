ADDIrESS t. ~the INDidPBN',P';T ELECTO.RS ofth CTYo

TClaim N our suffrages for a seat in Parliament on
the following grounds :-
F'irst. That I have devoted a long life to the stuidy of the labws of hiumanity, for the beneflt of the human race ; and half a, century to p)roving the truth of these principles in practice w ith a success never yet esluallol.
The reimilt of this experience is, that the Governmentseof thecivilised 'woild have now at their control the meest amnple means to enssire
he Pasice, and. the progress in goodness, knowiedge. wisdom, pros. pmerity, And happiness, f atll popuplatiuons, and to elfect thin change with esfetv, ease, anud' pleasure to every government, and that. to accompllsh this result, glorious to all humanity.fu'ur subjecta are alone neceesary to be well understood, and the knowledge of which maay now he easily acquired by the populationl Of the world under rational instructoio. Theseare:-
1. Tno knowleulge how to form from buirth a good, useful, and mnost dlesirable phssical and mental character for every one horn with the xDatoral healihy qsuallties of humanity.
2. The knowledge how in the best manner to create abunidanice of good unadulteratest wealth for all, and how to distribute thin wealth wisely andI most beneficially for all.
3. The practicail knowledge how to create the surroitidings In vwhich to place all, to attain these resultst for society with theo certainty of a law of nainre.
4. The knowledge hew ihese measures can be the beat Intreduced and carried progressively into general practice, in peace, and with high pleasure to Government and Peoples.
Secondly,-I claim your suifrages, because It does noot appear, fromn the debates in both Houses of Psiliawent, that any member Possessed sound Isnow:eduro on asiy one of the precedhigc subjects-or, if any did possess this knowledge, theY had not morel courage to give it to the public.
As I nov, offer myseig a candidtate for Your, benefit, and not for mines, except as one of the public-it is but justice that you should pay the expenees of my attempt to become sueo of yosir members, which expenses, a I would non become a menmbur by the bribe of one voter, should not exceed CISO or e400 for hustings, do. If, tbereforo, you wilt raise a subscription for this piurpose, I sivil attend at the bustings and go to the poll.
I have already expended a large independent fortaune of may own earnings, and have applied a long life to prepare the public fer this great and glorfousehlauge b r humanity; atd my family of children and granidchildren now natsurally expect that I shouldI look to their poition in life. ushile they have to conutend with this false. Ignorant, selfish sytem, which for some time Yet must continue in practice. I cannot therefore expend for the public msake of thcse fuads which at myv death will rightfully and legally belong to muy child reo.

TTHE announced termination of the existence of the T1,present Parliament is at, baud ; it is understood that the dissolution will take Place os Satuirday next.
The question whence ha. arisen the supposed necessity for this step was one of the most difficult I have ever Known submitted to the decision of the Ifouse of Commons, one on which It was imposible to give any vote without anxiety and doubt. On the one hand was the reluctance to appear to sa""ction, proceedings of the British autboritiem in OCbina. of which it Is not possible wholly7 to approve ;--on the other, an app.rehenisionbhut tenwell grouanded, I fear, that the show of divided councils at hose and this repudiation of the a;cts ot our offocers abroad. mnight really tend to retard that settlement of 0i~:tmcat unhappy dis3pute which men of all pasties must sincerely di i,
Under these circumstanjces I felt it to be miy duty to snoport the Executive GSovernmsent. believing thant Ve Minis.er- ofrthe C'rown will be enabled to negotiate with better prospects of sucess, anid to take with greater effect whatever uleasoses may be nreassary for the protection of our fellow counxtrymen, and the miaintenance of the honouir of nglnd ifunfttredbytheae'luionsumitted to the Hlouse.

As a large farmer myself, I am alive to the adv.sstage3 which the inhabitants of Brighton and other large tnwne corfer upon us, Their interestsa Iam convinced, are really identical orith those of the country, end I will as I have ever done, do my best to support both.

H raetini, ofyour body as Candidate for the honouir of reprosenting the county of Berko in the House of Comnmons, I bog to olfer You my services and to eslcit the favour of your support at the approocbingBliection.
The lonig connexion of my famlly with your county, which was for many years represented by my lamented relative, Afr. Pusey, will, I trust. iustify me In accepting thie nomination and afford you a gurntee or the lntereet I must necessarily, tak-e in ihc wcelfare of Berkshiare.
Having always adhered, both in and out of Parliament, to liEral opinions, sod being amnong thoee who believe that timely amendim,nt, in the best mode of effectually preserving all. that is valuable tootor Isstitutione, I should be prepared to give ant independe.t huh corlial support to Her Majest)'s present Government, whose policy on the whole ls liberal in its aims and tendenctes.
While I deplore the condition. of affairs in China, I do not lay the blame of it on the Governmcnt, nor do I think they should have been visited with Parliamentary censure becauee they felt it their duty to support their diplomatic and navalI representatives in that distant region in dIfficult and trying circumstances.
Whben I remember the critical negotiations In Europe which Lord Palmerston hay brought to a sucereful lesue, It Is impossible wit to think thiAt his GJorerumenit may be safely entrusted with the task of bringing our differenc~s with the Chinese to a satisfactory conclusion.
Sincerely attached to tho Established Church, of which I am a member. I beliere her true strength to conisist, not In the number and affection of her adherents alone, but also in the conviction of these who do not coniform to her doctrinos or her discipline, that she wields no privilege injurious to themselves or at varlanno with that reigious liberty to which they justly lay complain. I shall be glad, therefore, to give my support to any measure which mLay afford the prospect of a settlement of the difFicult eindIirritating questions connected with the levying of church-rates.
Ithing many of our countrymen, who have now, no direct voice in choosing inembers of Parliasinet, are well qualifLed to exercise that wenstitutional privilegie with advantage to the community; I shall be willing, therefore, to give my onsent to a well-devised scheme for the extension of the franchise.
The interval between this aud the day of nomination wfll. I trust, enable me to Eceo many or you and give me au opportunity of entering more frilly into my views on those pubio questions on which you may desire fur'ther explantion

T'E PRESIDENT'S INAUGURAL
MESSAGE.
THE AMENDED TARIFF.
SOUTHAMPTON, FRMIAY.
The United States' mail steamship Fulton, Captain J. A. Wotton, arrived in Cowes-roads this morning, and her mails were delivered here at noon. I She arved under the Needles at 9 o'clock last night, but was detained by a dense fog until 9 a.m. to-day. This steamer left New York at 4 p.m. on the 7th inst., and brings three days' later news than the advices per the Asia. She has four passengers for England and 60 for Havre, for -which portshe proceeded after disembarking her mails, &C., 2r t place. She has on board $12,200 in specie, 1,200 barrels of flour, and 21 packages of samples for Havre.
The Hon. Charles Sumner, of Boston, Massachusetts, is on board the Fuiton, on his way to France, to improve his health.
On the 9th inst. the Fulton passed the bark Fleet Eagle, of Boston, from the Cape of Good
The steamers Atlantic and Persia, from Liverpool, had arrived at New York; the former on the 5th, and the latter on the 6th inst.
By the Fulton we have received President Buchanan's inaugural Message, which was delivered at Washington on the 4th inst. Subjoinedis a copy of the speech:-
" Felow Citizens,-I appear before you this day to take the solemn oath that I will faithfUlly execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. In entering upon this great office I must humbly invoke the God of our fathers for wisdom and firnness to execute its high and responsible duties in such a manner as to restore harmony and the ancient friendship among the people of the several States, and to preserve our free institutions throughout many generations. Convinced that I owe my election to the inherent love for the constitution and the Union which still animates the hearts of the American people, let me earnestly ask their powerful sup. port in sustaining al just measares calculated to perpetuate these the richest political blessings which Heaven has ever bestowed upon any nation.
" Having determined not to become a candidate for re-election, I shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the Govcrnment, except the desire ably and faithfully to serve my country and to live in the grateful memory of my countrymen.
" We have recently passed through a Presidential contest, in which the passions of our feUow-citizens were excited to the highest degree by questions of deep and vitalimportance; but when the people proclaimed their wil the tempest at once subsided, and all was calm. The voice of the majority speaking in the manner prescribed by the constitation was heard, and instant submission followed. Oar own country could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle cf the capacity of man for self-government.
" What a happy conception, then, was it for Congress to apply this simple rule-that the will of the majority shall govern-to the settlement of the question of domestic slavery in the territories. Congiess is neitner to legislate slavery into any territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, bht to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United States. As a natural consequence, Congress has also prescribed that when the territory of Kansas shaU be admitted as a State, it shall bh rereived into the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission. A different opinion has arisen in regard to the time when the people of a territory shaU decide this question for themselves. This is, happily, matter of but little practical impor tance, and, besides, it is a judicia question, which legitimately belongs to the Supreme Court of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, itis understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in common with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit, whatever this may be, though it has been my individual opinion that under the Nebraska-Kansas Act the appropriate period will be when the number of actual residents in the territory shall justify the formation of a constitution with aview to its admission as a State into the Union; but be this as it may, it is the imperative amd indispensable duty of the Government of the United States to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote. This sacred right of each individual must be preserved. This being accomplished, nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from aU foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves, subject only to the constitution of the United States. The whole territorial question being thus settled upon the principle of popular sovereignty--a principle as ancient as free government itself-everything of a practical nature bas been decided, and no other question remains for adjustment, because alU agree that under the constitution, slavery in the States is beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective States themselves wherein it exists. May we not, then, hope that the long agitation on this subject is approaching its end, and that the geographical parties to which it has given birth so much dreaded by the father of his country, wiUl speedily become extinct ? Most happy wiU it be for the country when the publc mind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and practical importance. Throughout the whole progress of this agittion, which has scarcely known any intermission for more than 20 years, while it has been productive of no positive good to any human being, it has been the prolific source of great evils to the master, to the slave, aud to the whole country; it has alienated and estranged the people of the sister States from each other, and has even seriously endangered the very existence of the Union ; nor has the danger yet entirely ceased.
' Under our -system there is a remedy for all mere Dolitical evils in the sound sense and sober jndpment of the people. Time is a great corrective. The political subjects which but a few years ago excited and exasperated the public mind have passed away, and are now nearly forgotten; but this question of domestic slavery is of far greater importance than any mere political question, because, should the agitation continue, it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a large portion of our countrymen where the institution exists. In that event no form of government, however admirable in itself, however productive of material benefits, can compensate for the loss of peace and domestic security around the family altar. Let every Union-loving man therefore exert his best influence to suppress this agitation, which, since the recent legislation of Congress, is vithout any legitimate object. It is an evil of the times that men have undertaken to calculate the mere material value of the Union. Reasoned estimates have been presented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would result to different States and sections from its dissolution, and of the comparative injuries which such an event 'would inflict-on other States and sections. Even descendingto thislow and narrow view of the mighty question, aU such calculations are at fault. The bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusive on this point. We at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expansive country, such as the world never witnessed. This trade is cobducted on railroads and canals, on noble rivers and arms of the sea, which bind together the north and the south, the east and the west of our confederacy. Arnihilate this trade, arrest its free progress by the geographical lines of jealous and hostile States, and you destroy the prosp.rity and onward march of the whole and every part, and involve all in one common ruin. But such considerations, important as tbey are in themselves, sink into insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would result from disunion to every portion of the confederacy-to the North not more than to the South, to the East not wore than to the West. These I shall not attempt to pourtray, because I feel an humble confidence that the kind Providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of government and union ever devised by man, will not suffer It to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by its example in the extension of civll and religious liberty throughout the world.
"Next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union is the duty of preserving the Government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption. Public virtue is the vital spirit of republics, and history proves that when this has decayed, and the love of money has usurped its place, although the forms of free
government may remai for a season, the substance has departed for ever.
"'Our present fmnancial condition is without a parallel in history. No nation has ever before been embarrassed from tco large a snrlus in its treasury. This almost neces-
sarnly gsves birth to extravagant legislation. It produces 'wild schemes of expenditures, and begets a race of
speculators and jobbers whose ingenuity is exerted in ontriving and promoting expedients to obtin the u.blic mOney. The party, through its official agents whether rightfully or wrongfully, is suspected, and the character of the Government suffers in the estimation of the people. This is in itself a very great evil. The aational mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the surplus in the treasury to great national objects for which a clear warrant can be found in the constitution. Among these I might mention the extinguishment of the public debt; a reasonable increase of the navy, which is at present inadequate tothe protection of our vast tonnage afloat-now greater than that of any other nation as well as the defence of our extended seacoast.
"It is, beyond all question, the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collected from the peopler than the amount necessary to defray the expenses of a wise, economical, and efficient administration of the Government. To reach this point it was necessry to resort, to a modifies tion of the tariff, and this has been ccomplished in such a manner as to do as little iujury as may have been practicable to our domestic manufactures especially those necesary for the defence of the country. iny discrimination against A particular branch for the purpose of bonefitting favoured corporation; individuals, or interests would have been unjust to the rest of the commLunity, and inconsistent with that
sirnt of fairness and equallt which ought to govern in the
justment of a revenue tariff
" Bnt the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative insignificancoe as a temptation to cotraption when compared with the squandering of the public lands. No nation i the tide of timeo has ever been blessed with so rich and noble an inheritanco as we enjoy in the public lands. In administering this important trust, wbile it may be wise to grant portions of them for the im;provement of the remainder, yet we should never forget that it is our cardinal policy to reserve these lands as much as may be for actual sottlers, and this at moderate prices. We shAll thus not only best promoto the prosperity of the new States by furnishing a hardy andindependent race of honest and industrious citizens, hut shall secure homes for our children and our children's children, as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may xeek i-n this country zo impruve their condition and to enjoy the blesings of civil and religious liberty. Sach emigrants have dono mueb to promote the growth and prosperity of the country. They have proved faithful both in peace and in war. After becoming citizens they are entitled, under the constitation and laws, to ba placed on perfect equality with native-horn citizens, and in this character they should ever be kindly recognized. The Federal Constitution is a grant from the States to Congress of certain specific powers, and the question whether this grant shall be liberally or strictly constiued has, more or less, divided political parties from the beginning.
"Without entering into the argument, I desire to state at the commencement of ny administration that long experienco and observation have convinced mc that a strict construction of the powers of the Government is the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution. Whenever in our past history doubtful powers have been exercised by Congress they have never failed to produce injurious and unhappy consequences. Many such instances miphtbe adduced if this were the proper occasion. Neither is it necessary for the public service to strain the language ot the constitation, because all the great and useful powers required for a successful administration of the government, both in peace and in war have been granted either in e3press terms or by the plainest implication, w e deeply convinced of these truths, I yet consider it clear that, under the war-making power, Congress may appropriate money towards the construction of a miltary road wben this is absolutely necessary for the defence of any State or territory of the Union against foreign invasion. Under the constitution, Congress has power to declarewar, to raise and support armies, to provide and maintai a navy, and to call forth the militia to repel invasion. Thus endowed in an ample manne: with the war-making power, the corresponding duty is required that the United States shall protect each of them (the States) against invasion. How ss it possible to afford this protection to California and our Pacific possessions except by means of a military road through the territory of the united States, over which men and munitions of war may be speedily transported from the Atlantic States to meet and repel the invaders? In case of a war with a naval Power much stronger than our own, we should then have no other available access to the Pacific coast, because stich a Power would inatantly close the route across the isthmus of Central America. It is impossible to conceive that while the constitution has expressly required Congress to defend all the States, itshould yet deny to them, by any fair construction, the only possible means by which one of these States can be defended. Besides, tho Government, ever since its origin, has been in the constant practice of constructing miltary roads. It might also be wise to consider whether the love for the Union which now animates our fellow-citizens on thePacific coast may not be impaired by our neglect or refusal to provide for them, in their remote and isolated condition, the only means by which the power of theStatesonthissideof tbe rockymountainscanreachthemin snfdicient time to protect them against invasion. I forbear for the present from expressing an opinion as to the wisest and most economical mode in which the Government can lend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work. I beleve that many difficulties i the way, which now appearformidable, wil in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route shal have been satisfactorily ascertained.
" It may be right that on tbis occasion I should make some brief remarks as to our rights and duties as a mnember of them eat family of nations. In our intercourse with them tuere are some plain principles approved by our own experience, from which we should never depart. We ought to cultivate peace, commerce, and friendship with aU nations, and this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material interest, but in a spirit of Christian benevolence towards our fellow-men wherever their lot may be cast. Our diplomacy should be direct and frank-neither secking to obtain more nor accepting less than is our due. We ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of aU nations, and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of any, unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of self-preservation. To avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of onr policy ever incetho days of Washington, andits wisdom no one will attempt to dispute. In short, we oughttodojusticoinakindly spirit toallnations, and require justice from them in return. It is our glory that, while other nations have extended their dominious by the sword, we have never acquired any territory except by fair purchase, or, as in the case of Texas, by the voluntarv determination of a brave, kindred, and independent pwoole to blend their destinies with our own. Even our acquisitions from Mexico form no exception; unwiling to take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister Republic, we purchased these possessions, under the treaty of peace, for a sum which was considered at the time a fair equivalent.
" Our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory, unless this be sanctioned by the la-ws of justice and honour. Acting on this principl", no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if, in the progress of events, we shall stiUl farther extend our possessions, Hitherto in all our acquisitions th peor,le under the protection of the American flag havo enjoye civil and religious liberty as weIl as equal and just laws, and have been contented, prosperous, and happy. Their trade with the rest of the world has rapidly increased, and thus every commercial nation has shared largely in their successful progress. I sbal now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the constitution, while humbly invoking the blessing of divine Provi. dence on this great people."
The inauguration ball at Washington, the closing scene of the ceremonies, passed off satisfactorily. The new President and Vice-President were present, and were received with the greatest enthusiasm. Ex-President Pierce was too unwell to be present.

The ewv York Evning Post of the 6th publishes the following important particulars relative to the amended tariff just adopted -
" In another part of this sbeet we publish the statute amending our tariff of duties enacted by Congress at tho session which kas just closed. This Act, which was agreed upon by the Committee of Conference as a compromise between the different plans discussed for reducing the indirect taxes, passed on Monday night by a large majority in both Houses of Congrees. In the Senate the voto stood 3.3 to 8; in the House, 124 to 79. It gives, on the whole, more satisfaction than was expected to the different interests represented at Washington. Those who complain most loudly are the wool-growers and the manufacturers of fine broadcloths. The former complain of the provision which makes cheap wools duty free; the latter, tbat thedulty on fine wools is not low enough. The cottoi manufacturers are pleased -with the admission free of dye stuffs, acids and manufacturing materials generally, which more than compensates them for the slight reduction of the duties on imported cotton fabrics. A distinction was made in the Bill between fine cotton goods and the cheaper unbleached kinds. The latter wereplaced at 19 per cent., for the same reason, doubtless, that cheap wool was placed in the free list-viz., to suit the convenience of Southern planters, who will thus get their negro blankets and shirts at lower prices.
"1 The Bill is not what it ought to be in all respects, though, perhaps, the best that could be got. Instead of simplifying the tariff by adopting two or three schedules, vwith a free list, Congress has complicated the business by retaining nine schedules, while the number of free articles is by no means enough to effect that reduction of the revenue which was the main object of their legislation on the subject. Iron and sugar are the interests which are most unfavourably affected by the measure, rs, unlike the producers and manufacturers of wool and cotton, they gain no compensating advantage for the reduction on their staples.
'ron ann sugar are, by the new tariff, reduced from 30 percent,to 24 per cent. Wool costing over 20 cents a pound at the port of exportation is also reduced from 30 per cent, to 24 per cent., while wool costing less, and heretofore taxed 30 per cent., is placed on the free list. Fine cottons are redaced from 25 per cent, to 24 per cent., and cottons unbienched fromr 2 to 19 percent.
' The different schedules are thus arranged:
Schedule A, of the tariff of 1846. includes brandy, cordrale, and all spintuous liquors, which were taxed 100 per cent, of their value; and schedule B includes wines, cigars, manufactured tobacco, sweetmeats, meats, game, alabaster and spar ornaments, spices, hc., which are charged with a duty of 40 per cent. Tbe duty on the articles included in both schedules is now to be 30 per cent.
"I Schedule C, under the tariff of 1846, included a large list of commodities, among -which wvre iron, glasq, woollens, sugar, ale, and beer, charged with a duty of 30 per cent. These are now subject to a duty of 24 per cent. k'rom this list are excepted by the Act of 1857 gieger, green, ripe, dried, preserved, or pickled; ochres asid ochery earths; medicated roots, leaves; gums and resins in a crude state, not otherwise provided for; wares, chymical, earthern, or pottery, of a capacity not exceeding 10 gallons, which are transferred to schedule E, and the duty reduced to 15 per cent. All bleacbed. printed, or dyed cottons, also, hereafter belong to this schedule, and pay 24 per cent. on their value.
" Schedule D, including flannels, flooreloths, carpets, baizes, hemp, manufactured silk, cables, cordage, &c., undergoes a reduction from 25 per cent. to 19. Japanned leather and skins of all kinds aretransferred to this schedule.
Schedule E, which under the tariff of 1846 paid a dutv of 20 per cent., and comprised an extensive list of oommodities among which were blankets, furs on the skin, all oils used in painting, various pigments, metals, timber, and wood of varous kinds, barley, beef, he., is now to pay a duty of 4 per cent.
"Schedule F, which includes a few articles paying hitherto a duty of 15 per cent., such as arsenic, gold and silver laf, steel in bars, cast or shear, Ac., will pay a duty of 12 per cene. Borate of lime nd codilla, or tow of
heup and 9lax, are added to this schedule.
"Schedule G, including hooks, magazines, pamphlets. periodicals an d illustrated newvspapers, en gravingsl or plates, gems and precious stones, wratches, I;c., is reduced irom 10 to 8 per cent, To this schedule are referred anti-
mony, barks, crudo camphor, cantharides_, ctbonate of soda, emery; frui s, green, ripe, and dried; giii arabic and other like gums machinery imported for mSaking flax and linern good, tin in plates or sheets, sponges, and various ornamental woods.
' Sdhedule H, which under the tariff of 1846 was charged with 5 per cent., Is to pay 4. This includes raw hides, brass, and tin in pigs or bars, tortoiseshells, aii
and spelter unmanufactured, &c. To this schedule a considerable nutmber of articles is transferred.
"o Schodule or tho free list, is enlarged by the addition of a large number of oommodities.
A moat important incident in tho news by this aT rival is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Dred Scott, a nego, who claimed his freedom on the ground that he had resided two years by the act of his owner in a State where savery was prohibited by its constitution, and afterwards in a territory from which it was prohibited by thoMissouri compromise. The Supreme Court denies the validity of his claim, and decides the following points:-
1. That Scott, beinga negro, Is not a dtizen, inasmuch as men of tho African race, whether slave or free, are not citizens of the United States. He cannot therefore sue in the courts of the United States.
" 2. The ordinance of 1787 had no independent constitutional force or legal effect subsequently to the adoption of the Constitution, and oould not operate of itself to confer freedom or citizenship witbin the north-west territory upon negroes not citizens by the Constitution.
" 3. The Act of 182', commonly called the Missouri Comromise, in so far as it undertook to exclude negro slavery lrom, andg gvfreedom and ctizenship to negroes in, the northern part of the Louisiana cession, was a legislative act exceeding the powvers of Congress, and void and of no legal effect to that end."
Several incidental points were also determined in deciding these main points. The delivery of the opinion occupied about three hours.
The Assembly passed the Bill providing. for the removal of the quarantine on the 5th inst. Nothing of importance was done in the Senate.
The steamship Illinois left Now York on the 5th for Aspinwall, carrying out about 500 passengers, including a detachment of 250 United States' soldiers bound for Oregon and Washington territories.
By way of New Orleans we have received details of the news from the city of Mexico to the 10th and Vera Cruz to the 12th ult. The new constitution was sworn to on the 5th ult. by President Comonfort and many other public functionaries and generals. The Constituent Assembly had addressed the people, asserting the inefficiency of the plan of Ayutla, and the new constitution was generally approved. The new treaty with the United States would, it was hoped, result in great commercial advantages to both republics, and form a bond of closer union between the Governments.
We learn from Omaha City, under date of the 12th ult., that the closing scenes of the Legislature of Nebraska Territory were very exciting. The popular voice had charged several members with corruption with respect to their votes on the passage of some bank charters. In consequence the Governor vetoed six charters so obtained. A crowd of rioters pursued the members accused to the office of the Territorial Secretary, and, disregarding all form of an investigating committee, attempted to inflict personal chastisement on one legislator. Re threatened to shoot with a revolver in reply, when the Secretary turned the whole batch into the street. Here the suspected members ran off and concealed themselves. The legisative session would close on the 13th of February. The Governor was completely bewildered by these occurrences.
The business at the New York Stock-Exchange on the 6th inst. was again quite large, the orders from outside parties being evidently on the increase. The brokers themselves were becoming more equally divided in opinion as to the immediate prospects of the market, and, although at and after the close of the regular dealings at each session the Bears make strong efforts to weaken the general tone, the registered sales were rather above than below the advance established on the previous day. The business was even better distributed throughout the official list, and adds up 28,000 shares and about S50,000 in bonds, the latter mostly in retail parcels. New York and Erie and Reading were 4 to I per cent., offered in the " street" after the adjournment of the afternoon Board. New York Central, 91; Hudson River up 2 per cent. since Wednesday; sales at 304 cash; Mlilwaukee and Mfississippi up 1J per cent., and no stock offered at the close at the advanced bid of 72i; Illinois Central largely done at 140 to 139 to 138&- per cent.; La Crosse and Milwaukee rose $ per cent.; Michigan Southern Sinking Fund Bonds in request at 80 per cent.
n money the inclination was to ease in the discolmt-market, and good paper since the 4th of March payments, which were heavy and well met, was in request at 9 per cent. for prime and 10 per cent. for fair lists, On demand loan there was some additional activity, owing to the heavy business doing on the Stock-Exchange and the dulness in foreign bills, of which the regular banking houses have now a good supply. An old and leading firm reduced their rate on London to 1084, and the quotation for first-class bills is now 108 to 1081.
The European news to hand by the Atlantic and Persiahadadepressinginfluenceon the cotton-market yesterday, and sales of about 4,000 bales were made, chiefly in transsiht, at prices which indicated a decline of about ic. per lb. below the extreme high rates current in the fore part of the week. The Persia having been telegraphed early in the forenoon checked sales of flour, which closed dull at the previous day's prices, with moderate sales. Wheat was in fair demand, with sales of Southern white at $1 73c., Missouri red at $1 62c. to $1 54c., and common western ditto at $1 46 c. Corn was firm, and western mixed sold at 73*c. to 74c., and old and new Southern yellow at 76c. Pork was firm, with sales of new mess at $23 70c. to $23 75c.; at the close $24 was asked. Lard was in active demand for future delivery, and sales freely made at 14ic., and a sale was also reported to arrive at 15c. Sugarswere steady, with sales of 500 to 600 hogshsads and 1,000 boxes. Coffee sold to the extent of about 1,500 to 2,000 bags of aU kinds, at steady prices. Freights continued to rule low. To Liverpool 40,000 bushels of corn, in bulk and bags, were engaged at 44c. to 4*c., and some wheat in bags at 41c., flour at Is. 6d. to Is. 7d., and lard at 15s. To other ports rates were quiet, and quotations unchanged.

NEW GUANO DEPOSITS.-The guano trade,-so
I N>fEWV GUANO T osiT.-Tho guano trade,-so important to the agricultural interests of the world,-is at the present moment, attracting special attention in Eiurope. It is estimated that the guano at the Chincha Islands will last for another century * but, as this is a monopoly in the bands of a Government that uses its advantages to raise, at pleasure, the price of an indispensable conunodity, great efforts have been made to discover new deposits. In a bnsiness point of view no blame can be attached to Pera. She has been hitherto the sole possessor of a valuable article of commerce, and as long as this is the case she has tbe er, and perhaps the right, to place a fictitious valne hu ner exports. But monopoly is not the onlv objec¢ tion to the Chineha trade. The frequency of revolution in Peru and the change of Government from one faction to another have been serious impediments to com-merce, and, even as we write, it is impossible to say whetber the islands are in the possession of Vivnnco or Castilla, or how far the foreign vessels loading there ean be protected by local authority. The attention of the Government and people of England has been lately turned to certain guano islandg off the coast of Arabia, situated in Rooria-Mooria Bay, about 20 miles from the mainland. They were ascer. tained to be extremely valuable, and a cession of the ialands in favour of Great Britain was obtained from the Imaum. of Buscat, of whose posssessions they were supposedi to form a p rt. They are represented as comrpletely covered with guano; and though the depth of the deposit has not been ascertained, it is known from actual observations to be more than six feet. According to a rough estimate, it is considered thab the quautity of guano on the whole group will amount to 2,000,000 tons, 'with weather favouraWle for shipping it during eight montbs in the year. After the islands were ceded by the Imaum of Mi uscat the British Government, to reward Captain Ord, tho discoverer, granted him for fiveyears a license to load the
fano for English ports. An expedition to the Island of wash was thereupon fittedout, but whenthe vessels reached their destination, and some90tons hadbeen aetiuyllysipped, themen were attacked and forced to quit by -aVlarge body of Arabg 'who refussed to recognize t-he right of the Imaum to cede the islands. Thus the matter stands for the present. The persons 'who went out on the expedition com lain that proper protection was not afforded them by the mritish Government, and asked thbat, for the future, a vessel of war be stationed at the Kooria-Moorig. This request, considering the importance of the interests at stake, we suppose 'ill t;egranted. It- so, 'e may expecta yevolution in theguanotrade. FronmtheKooria-Mooria grobip the voyago to Englard is 20 days shorter than from the Chincuas, and, once open to commerce, they wil draw off European vessels from the Peruvian trade and break up his monopoly. The Peruvian Government 'wil then l,e forced to reduce its present high prices, and its Aseericaa customers will be mot benefited by the reduction.-New York Tjmngs,
Parliamentary Intelligence.
PARLLDIENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
ROUSE OF LORDS, FIuAsY, uiAiCi 20.
The House met at 5 o'clock.
SOUTHAMPTON AND DORCHESTER RAT WAY.
The Earl of MXL1MESBU.RY begged to remind the noble lord the President of the Board of Trade of the conversation which took place in that House last session with reepect to the promise made by the South-Western Railway Company on the passing of the Act for the construction of tho Southampton and Dorchester RaRway. The income of that company had at that time reached within a very few pounds of the sum the receipt of which would render it obligatory on them to complete a double line of railway. They last year promised his noblo friend that they would make a double line to the extent of, he believed, 20 miles. The traffic and inconvenience on the railway had imnnensely increased, but although the company paid a dividend of 6. per cent. they had scarcely done anything towards tlie completion of a double line. He believed that the only mneans by which his noble friend could procure the completion of a double line was to insist on the company carrying into effect the strict letter of their Act of Parliamente.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY had been informed that the comp3ny had completed about six miles of the second line, and that they would comnpltte the remainder as quickly as possible. It was true that the traffic of the coinpany had increased amazingly, and there was no reason why they should not be comiipelled to construct a double linle along the entire length of the Southampton Railway without unreasonable delay.
SALE OF POISONS.
The Marquis of WESTMEATH wished to be informed whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill next session for regulating the sale of poisons? The necsesity for such a mieasure had been proved by a case which unfortunately came recently within his own knowledge. The child of one of his relations was poisoned last sunmsier by medicine that was sent from a chymist's shop at Wevinouth. The medicine was sold by a boy who was too young to he an apprentice, and the only other person in the shop aIb he tiim of the sale was a boy of 14 years of age. The chyn:ist had left his shop in charge of these two boys. llnforiunately the mother herself administered the dreadful dose to her own child. A long investigation took p lace be. foie a coroner's jury, and a verdict of manslaughter wa5 returned again,t the two boys. Bills were sent before tle grand jury against them, but those bills were ignored. HIe did not mesan to throw any blame on the grand
ur oron the lawz officers of the Crown,
ou he thought there could he no doubt that the
safety f the public positively required that some legislativ-e measttre should be passed on the subject. Since the bills were thrown out the chymist in question had inserted all advertisesa,eat in the newspapers, to the effect that his establishrment w;as excellently managed and wonld continue to g ive every satisfaction to the public. He (the Marquis of Westmneath) was sure that his noble and learned friend on the woolsack would admit that an end ought to to put to the administrationl of medicine by incompetent and irresponsible persons.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said, the subjectl:ad been under the consideration of the Government, but it Was5 almcost as difficult a one as could be dealt with. It must be adn;itted that frequent instances of the nature alluded to h.ad occurred; but lie was afraid tiat an enumeration of poisonlous articles sold in chyiiistss shops, with the view of prevenlting their being iroproperly bought or administered, would rather ar-eat the attention of such per-sons as dFsired to administer deadly poisons than tend to the decresse of unlortunate cases such as that at Weymouth. Difficult, however, as t te subject was, the Government were ergaged in eonsidering it, and if it were po.ssible they would introculas a bill with regard to it, hut he could not give any plealge. Jt had been suggested that chynists should be compelled to take out licenses for the sale of dirugs, but that would be a poor remedy, for, whatever directions rmight be given as to their saie, chyniists would occasionaLly leave their shops in the management of persons incapable of attending completely bo its business. Itbwas impossible for the Legislature to provide against alU eases of carelessness in the sale of dregs.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE suggested the desirableness of adopting in this country the practice which prevailed in Russia as to the sale of poisons, and which was this-a chymist or private individual who had poison in his possession was subject to a heavy fine if it w as not enveloped in a paper of certain colour.
On the motion of Lord Rl;EBESPLE it was moved and agreed to, that the proofs aiready taken before the Examiners for Standing Orders, and certHfied by them in respect of any B-ll wvhich shall be re-introduced into Parliament in the emn.ing session, shall he received by the Standing Order Comiiittee in that esesion in relation to ail such Bills, It -was also moved and agreed to, that Samuel Smith, Esq., and Charlese Frere, Esq., he appointed examiners for standing orders for the ensuing session.
The following Bills were severally read a third time and pa-sed :-Thse Mtutiny Bill, the Marine Mutiny Bill, Mr. b;rleaker'sO RetBirement Bill, and the Exchequer-bills
TEIE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT,
On the third reading of the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill,
The Earl of ELLENBOROtIGH rose and said,-As the motion for the third reading of this Bill announces the approsching termiiiation of the session, I trust I may be allowed to offer afew words to your lordships on the peculiar circumstances which have led to its premature conclusion. I believe the circumstances are these. The Governor of Hongkong having taken ample reparation for an aileged offence, and the circumstances being such as would have enabled himn to come at once to a pacific settlement with the Chinese authorities, thought fit to make at a time the most cnpropitious anew demand, which it was obviously impossible under the circurnstances that the Chinese authorities would accede to. Hence arose the war, That war has b-en approved by Her Majesty's Government; and the question having been submitted to the House of Commons that assembly, by a small majority, thought fit to express their opinion that there were not sufficient grounds for the m3easures adopted in China and approved by Her Majesty's Government. Upon that the course adopted by tbe Government was to advise the Queen to dissolve Parliament; and the memnbers of the House of Commons are to be sent to their constituents for judgment. At first a charge was made of conspiracy and concert, an:d coalition, and of aUl those various offences which a dissatisfied Government usually charges on a successful Opposition. However, that charge has been denied, and is now altogeether withdrawn. Fronm the first it was unreason able, and no one who considered the matter for a few moments could by possibility have given credence to it. (Hear, hear.) Now, I apprehend that two questions practically are to b.. submitted to the people,-first, whether they prefer Lord Palmerston to any other Mtinister ? and, secondly, whether they approve 'tbis war? Now, I think it not at all impossible that the answver given to the first question may be in the affirmabive,-that the people do on the whole prefer Lord Palmerston to
any other Mlinister; but I feel the most perfect confidence that the answer given to the tecond question will be that they cannot approve the circumstances under which the war commenced, and that they desire that it should be terminated as speedily as iossibhe. (Hlear, hear.) So that in fact the position of the Government after the dissolution will be, practically, precisely the same as now. But there is a very importanlt question involved in the commencement of these proceedings, and it is the question to what ex;tent it is politic to give support to distant authorities in measures undertaken by those authorities which endanger the pacific relations between the country and aforeign State. (Hear, hear.) If S r J. Bowring is to be supported, he being Governor of H.ngkong, because he has undertaken measures which led to war with the Chinese authorities in his neighbourhood, I kno v not why, upon the same principle, the Governor of G.braltar might not adopt measures which would lead to a e ,nR ict between us and the Spanish Government, or a Goverr: or of a WVest India colony might not engage in a war with the United Sitates, and involve this countrysin most serious difficulty. (Hear, hear.) To the principle that our authorities abroad ought to have a fair and liberal construe tion placed on their acts no one can object, but that it should be incumbent on the Government in a most ques. tionable cause to extend their support to their authorities abroad, and involve this country in war, appears to mne one of the most dangerous innovations. (HIear, hear.) Now that the representatives of the people are to be sent to their constituents, who are the persons to suffer 7 The noble earl, the President of the Council has told us that he is far from desiring that the 48 old Whigr who voted against the Government should be
among those who are to suffer. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Now, it appears to me hLat that is contrary to the usual feeling in these matters. Those gentlemen who have given their support and confidence to the Government, and at a moment of peril withdraw their support and confidence, commit, it is generally considered, according to the doctrines of parties as they existed in former times, almost An act of treason. I remember, when I was a member of the House of Commons, if any Whig gentleman presumed to differ from his party, to make an independent speech, or to give an independent vote on any occasion, he was fired at from all parts of tho House. What he suffered in the House was perceptible, but what he underwent afterwards at Brooks's was only to be imagined. The punishment was sure to deter from a repetition of the offence. (Laughter.) Bat now, when the offence
is committed by 48 persons, distinguished members of the Whig party, not only are they not to be punished, but while others aro to be punished they are to be rewarded by tho retention of their seats. (" Hear," and laughter.) The noble earl the President of the Council hates the treason but likes the traitors; I also join with the noble earl in desiring that no mischief should happen to those 48 persons. - They
have given one good honest vote, and I hope that they may live to give many more with bdtter result. (Hear, hear.) I confess that I have an old feeling in favour of the old Whigs. Some of the old predilections are remaining about me, and I confess I do not see that any injury would
be done by the continuance of that great party in strength. I cannot say the same thing with respect to those who are, as the noble and learned lord sitting at the table once expressed it, " Whigs, and something more." That is quite a different thing. (" Hear," and laughter.) With respect to the gentleman termed "R Radical," I entertain very much the opinion which I recollect havinig heard expressed in this HouEe with his usual classical felicity by the late Marquis of Wellesley, " radice in Tartara tendit." Whether all of that class go to that termination I will not say, but, undoubtedly of late years, there have been certain circumstances with reference to pecuniary transactions which lead to the conclusion that that expression, if not generalJy correct, is not absolutely inaccurate. (Laughter.) Butif those gentlemen who, being friends of the Government, voted against the Government, are not to suffer, why should the Conservatives suffer? They never gave their con'idence to the Government; and why, then, were they to be expected on this serious question-on which so many honest Whigs voted against the Government-to give confidencetotheGovernment; and why are they to be punished for not giving a confidence which they had always Withheld? There is another party, smail in numbers, but great in intellect, ability, and knowledge of public affairs, called the Peelites. I never belonged to that party, though I have the greatest respect for my old colleagnes; and they were certainly in a position in wvhich no man could question the propriety of their g:ving an independent vote, for they had never given their confidence of late to the Government; and therefore really I do not see how those three different parties, against whom this charge of coalition has been made, can justly suffer in consequence of the dissolution. And now allow me to state very shortly the circumstances with which some of your lordships at least may not be acquainted, in order to show what are practically the effects of this war which has been so recklessly undertaken by Sir
-.Bowsirg. (Hear,) Ididnotknowtheotherdayallthat haI taken place, but I mentioned to your lordships the fact that the interruption of our trade with China would produce the greatest possible distress. I have since seen something which goes leyend all that I had anticipated. I find that between the 7th of January and the 5th of February the rate of discourt of the Bank of Bengal was raised from 6 to 14 per cent. (Hear, hear.) I, unfortunately, am acquainted with the difficulties of earrying on commerce in India. I know that if a gentleman in India makes SO,0001. or 100,0001. he either transfers his property to this country or le leaves it in India upon loan. The consequence is that a great portion of the trade of that country is carried on with borrowed money. Now, if in this country, where commerce is sound, the rate of discount were raised from 6 to 14 per cent., we know what wide-spread ruin would ensue; but in a countrywhere commerce is not in a sound state, and where trade is carried on with borrowed raoney, such a rise in the rate of discount necessarily involves a state of utter general ruin (lear, hear), aud consequently must be followed by the faillire of many hoisses and the embarrassment of the Government. The Government have advertised since the commencemnent of the unfortunate war with China for a loan of 3,000,0001. at 5 per cent. They had vainly endeavoured previously to raise a loan at 4A per cent. They were able to raise very little at 5 per cent., and the general opinion is that they wil only raise it at 7 per cent. unless they give some indulgence to persons having 4 per Cent. Stock. (Hear.) See 'what an unfortunate position the holders of East India 4 per Cent. Stock are in. They had D per cent., but two or three years ago they were induced to accept 4 per cent. They had then no idea that the Government would raise a fresh loan at 5 per cent. Their stock is now at 19 per cent, discount ; and I ask your lordships what must be the position of a gentleman 'who, 'with stock at 19 per cent. discoent, can only borrow money upon it at 14 per cent. (Hear hear.) The price of opium has fallen greatly, so much so that it is perfectly certain that at the next sales of Government opium which may take jplce there will be ae loss of 25 per cent. Now, a loss of 25 per cent., if it does not go beyond that, is equivalent to 750,0001. a-year. That invo ves so great a loss, and will be followed by so many difficulties in that country, that it will be, in my opinion, a matter for the immediate consideration of the Government whether they will not interfere with some pecuniary assisance. My opinion is that it will be desirable at once to obtain the authority of Parliament to advance 2,000,0001. or 3,000,0001. in Exchequer-bills by the home Government to thast country. Why the Government of that country should not obtain an indulgence which has been granted to Sardinia and to half theStates of Europe l;rnow not, but the result would be that to the extent of that sum remittances would nottake place from this country, and if anything could restore tranquillity to the money-market of that country, it would be some such measure. Your lordshins have also to consider the effect of that war upon this country. As I understood two or three weeks ago, there has already been a diminution in our imports of monre than 10,000,OOOlb. of tea. We miay, if the war continues, expect a diminution of of from 35,000,0001b. to 40,000,0001b. of tea, and a loss of one third of the revenue now derived from tea. I will not attempt to calculate the extent of the injury by the general interruption of the trade of the world, but the directloss to this country of the revenue now derived from tea will amount to a very considerable sum. Taking both England and India, in various ways the injury inflicted upon our commerce and revenue will produce a loss this year which cannot be estimated at less than 4,000,0001. A gentleman somewhere else said very reasonably, as I think-, that the House of Commons would find an advantage in parting with Lord Palmerston for 2,000,0001. We are now asked to pay 42000,000.1 for Sir J. Bowsing, and never was a public Character bought so extravagantly dear. (Cheers and laughter.) Now, as the question has been put whether Lord Palmerston is better than any other Minister, and as we are told that he is, because he carried on a glorious war and obtained a satisfactory peace, I beg to be allowed to say one word on that subject. I cannot consider any war glorious in which Kars was abandoned, aud which had two failures to correct its greatest achievments. There are some matters connected with the war which we have much pleasure in remembering, and others which we shall desire to forget. There have been many things to imitate, and much of which we shall desire to obliterate the remembrance. I do not consider that a glorious war which has not advanced the character of the British army, although it has advanced the character of the British soldier. I do not think that a satisactory peace in which, in consequence of the abandonment of liars and the fall of all that upper portion of the country, the cession of that portion of Bessarabia which would have most effectually improved the frontier of Turkey was abandoned, and in which, having obtained the promise of the left bank of the Danube and the Pruth, the occupation of which according to the line agreed upon would have practically thrown back the Russians to the Dniester, that line of the U pper Pruth was again left in the possession of Russia. I cannot consider that a satisfactory peace in which we lost the Upper Pruth, which, in a military point of view, was alone valuable. The object of that war was the independence of Tarkey, but Turkey has in Asia interests quite as important as she has in Europe, and in Turkey in Asia nothing was done, and no advantage was obtained. She lost Kars, which has most naturally affected her character and prestige in Asia; and my firm belief is that the abandonment of Wars and the consequent discouraosment of the population of that country have most material7y contribluted to the war With Persia. The two questions are most intimately affected, and I think that if, as we should have done, we hau maintained Wars, and if, as we should have done, we had given an advantage to Turkey on the side of Asia, we should not only have supported her, but protected our own interests in Asia. (Hear.) My lords, among the various qualities which are required in a Minister of this country none is more valuable than the quality of economy, and notwithetanding this has ceased to bear so high a position as it once did in the affections of the people of this country, yet I should imaRine there must be some persons at the ensuing election who wvill make some inquiries of Lord Palmerston's Government on the subject of economy. Iv'ill not trouble your lordships with any details, nor will I advert to any charges except those of the miscellaneous estimates. But your lordships will alow me to say that, for my part, it has always appeared to me that the first duty of the Government of this country is to place it in a state of perfect security against invasion from foreign nations. To a Government which wiU devote itself to bring to perfection the naval and military establishments I wi at all times give my most cordial support, nor could I ever become the friend of any Government whatever which neglected that 'which appears to me to be its first duty. But consistently with the performance of that duty there is another-to carry the most strict and most searching economy into the details of the establishments, to give the greatest possible efficiency at the smallest possible charge, and more especially to be economical in those parts of the expenditure vhich have no connexion with naval and military purposes. (Hear, hear.) Let us see how that is effected. I have looked through the estimates, which, in a recent return have beenuplaced in a form to give a compre-
hensive view of the expenditure from 1838 to 1856, and I find these results :-Without going hack to 1838, which would reaUly alarm people too much by showing the extent to which 'we have become extravagant, I compare the expenditure under the miscellaneous estimates of the thre years endinge I856 w.ith the thrge years JS e--dine' 18-".
Tne verY first itemn is public bhuildings and palaces. For the three years ending 1856 the average is 161,70I for tehreyears endling 1853 it is 115,5141.
Bu id int thlis year a large increase. The estimate for 1857 is 196,6691. The increase in the average of tke three years ending 1856 over the three vears ending 1853 is 46,2851. The further increase in this;year is 34,8701, The total increase sinee 1853 is 81,1551. I then go to an item of the same description-Royal parks anid pleasure-gardens. It was first voted in 1851, the expense having been previously paid out of the land revenues. The first vote in 1851 was 41,8291. The vote proposed for 1857 is 114,6011. In these two items alone, which have nothing whatever to do with naval and military establishments, the increase since 1853 in the one case, since 1851 in the other, is more than
140,0001. There then comes a charge whichi I think mnst be apable of explanation, for it is Perfectly monstrous. The
expense of printing and stationery in the three years ending 1853 was 2t6,4981. In the threo years ending 1856 It was 416,900I. The vote for 1857 Is *40,8751. So that the increase on the average of three years ending 1853 is 234,3771, There then comes a charge which a great many ersons coneider never can be too Freat especially tho noble earl the President of the Council, who is at tho head of the Education Committee. But I reaUy must call the attention of the Houns, and I wish to callthe attention of the public, to the alarming annual inereasein thiseharge foreducation, which I shallshow byreadingtheamountofthevotoinace8ssvsears-In 1851, 284,0001. ; in 1852, 324,0001.; in 1853, 442,i01. in 1854, 456,0001. ; in 1855, 612,0001. ; in 1856, o79,0001.
in 1857, 754,0001. So that the increase in that ehargo sinco 1851 is 474,0001., and it is a charge whicb threatens to increase. Observe, as regards the morals of the peoplo, how utterly useless it appears to be. While we lay out this enormous expense in making the people good, observe how great, at the same time, is tho expense of looking after those who are bad. (Hear, hear.) Convicts cost in 1848 477,5311 (I go to that year, because it is the first of the present form
of vote.) In 1856 they cost W06,3441., being an increase of 4Q8,CQ01. I cannot give the vote for this year, because it is not passed, and there is no estimate. Taki;g the three years ending in 1856, and comparing them with the three years ending 1853, there is an increase under that head alone of 152,0001. Let us just go back to the year 1833. Education cost 80,0001., convicts cost 313,2131.; making together 393,2131. In the year 1857 education cost 754,0001., in the year 1856 convicts cost 906,3741.; being together 1,660,374'. There is an increase in education and conuvict3 over the first year in the account of 1,267,1611. There is a class of votes which is called "special and temporary objects ;" and really under that bead I think what appears is more remarkablethan under any other. The account begins in 1838, and between that year and 1856 there are 126 different heads of charge, not less than 60 of which are new within the last three years-not less than G0 since Lord Palmerstan assumed the Government. (Hear, hear.) The average of that class of votes for the three years endin- 1840 was 213,3001., for the three years ending 1853 276,+2-2., and for the three years ending 1856 681,9661. The increase in the lost three years iS 4g4,7461., and, as compared with the tbree years ending 1810, the increase is 468,6661. Putting all the votes together and comparing 1S57 with the average of the three years endcng 1853 observe the inerease. Public buildings and palaces 81,1551.; loyal iarks and gardens 59,5481.; pnnting and stationery, 34,3771.; education, 404,7661.; science and ar't, 55,8691.; convicts, 152,1041. ; special and temporary objects, 404,7461.. - altogetherl,392,5451. havebeen added to the public charges in three years, under the heads to which I have drawn your lordships' attention. I say that no Government-no State -can go on with this extravagance. it is perfectly impossible. (Cheers.) I know that complaints during the progress of the war were made of tho extravagance with which it was carried on, and we were promised information and inquiry when the war was ended. No information has Deen given upon the subject, and the House of Commons, which ought to have inquired, las not done so. (Hear, bear.) Having gone through those points, I must ask your lordship-, and I should willingly ask any gentleman who appeared upon the hustings what Lord Paimerston's principles are. What I find is this:-Duringthetime Lord Palmerston has been a member of Parliament, before he became Prime minister, there were 13 Governments, and he was a member of 10 of themn. He las been a member of 10 out of 13, and of two the most extreme it is possible to conceive. He was a member of the Government of Lthe late Lord Grey, and he was a member of the Government of Mr. Peacevoal, and I never heard that he came to the smallest difference with either of his chiefs. (Laughter.) Therefore, I do not know what the principles of Lord Palmerston are. I think nothing is more probable than that he is a most agreeable and fascinatig colleague. No one can doubt that he is an excellent man of business, and his extraordinary experience in public offices must be of the greatest value to the public service. (Cheers.) It is evident that he has no ferocious rigiditv of opinion on any point, and that he makes no particuiar diffliculty in the conduct of the Government. He left the Duke of Wellington's Government not on account of any difficulty, but because others left. He assigned no other reason. Thero was no other reason. Other reasonzs may have been found afterward; but at the time he left there was: no other reason. Bat, although there can hardly be a better recommendation for a colleague than to have this facility, this accommodating feeling, in respect to the various measures which come under the consideration of the Cabinet and Parliament, it seems to me the public have something else to look to. (Hear, hear.) What the public have to look to is a fLxedness of opinion on public subjects, and, above all, a determination to stand by it. (Hear, hear.) I know not what may be Lord Palmerston's opinions on the subject of lReform. I see what his opinions are now by the vote which, unfortunately for his Government. he has lately given. (Hear, bear.) But being opposed to further reform, believing that the more numerous the ConstituencY the mnore inferior tho representative, and being satisfied that the public should look to the House of Commons for the direction of opinion, and not elsewhere, I am against any further alteration in the representation; and having no security that Lord Palmerston will adhere to that principle I would infinitely rather see the Government in the hands of an uncompromising, sound old Whig like Lord Grey, who said he would not be the shadow of a Minister, than in the hands of a gentleman who goes in one direction one day and another another day, and on whose support it is perfectly impossible to calcuate. (Cheers.) Not to detain you further, I must say I view this war with China with the greatest apprehension. We do not enter into it with the same feelings with which we have entered into other wars. There seems to me to be injustice connected with it. (Hear, hear.) Vhen engaged in the late war we were more than once desired to acknowledge our sins, to beg pardon for our offences, and to ask the blessings of Heaven on our endeavours to maintain the interests of the country in a just aud necessary war. And it was a necessary war. (Hear, hear.) We could not help it. However much we disliked it, we were obliged to enter upon it. We were justified then in hoping we might obtain the blessing of Providence. But how can we ask Providence for its blessings in this war?' We may, according to the best experience we have, do fall we possibly can to alleviate the sufferings of our troops. We may, by improved councils, do much more than seems at present intended to place our army in sufficient strength to achieve success. But ean we expect that success will attend our endeavontis from the conviction that we are working for a good purpose and that oar cause is a just one ? It seems to me that all along money has been the only object kept in view, and what the present object of the Government may be no one knows. (Hear, hear.) We hear of fighting for English interests, but what I want to know is what is the specfic object of our army going to Canton ? (Hear, hear.) We are endeavouring to force Dr. Bowring into Canton, which I think is an impracticable thing, and in endeavouring to force Dr. Bowring into Canton we are forcing tea outtof every cottage in England. (Cheers.) If we only import two-thirds of the quantity of tea we were aCcustomed to import, I fear that all the poorer classes may have to go without tea. Not only do I not feel at all satisfied as to the objects of the Government, but I want to know if they have not some further object in view; I want to know if they are not going to take advantaoe of this position of hostility to endeavour to revise the treaty as it is called, to force further conditions on the Emperor of China, and, in short, to obtain the means of making more money, for that seems the motive of the whole proceeding, however bad it may bein point of morality. (Hlear, hear.) But, my lords, we are not only going to ask that which we have no right to ask, but we are going to ask to have a friend to join us in the enterprise-rone who has no interest in the matter, and we two great Powers together, without any reasonable ground of quarrel with the Emperor of China (hear, hear) are to direct our united forces against his empire, for tne purpose of extorting from him soei
advantages to our trade, which will put more money into the hans of our merchants, but not a farthing into the hrands of the people. (Hear, hear.) I confess, my lords, that thes considerations fill me with alarm, and we ought to have a distinct answer from the Government in reference to them. For myself I feel satisfied that whatever may be the oypion of the public at the next election-about that I care lttle-I feel perfectly confident that it is humanly inspossible that the ultimato judgment of the public should not maintain the independent and honest vote of the majority of the House of Commons. (Cheers.)
Earl GRANVILLE.-.My lords, the duty devolves on me to make some observations in reply to the attack which the noble earl has just thought right to make on Her lajesty's Government. With respect to the alleged coalition, I do not think it necessary for me to go over that ground again; but as the noble earl bas stated that, in his judgment, the charge of a coalition was made under such circumstanees that no one ought to have given credence to it, I think I am entitled to say that, on a consideration of the eircumstances, there was very good ground for believing that something more than a coincidence had occasioned the recent vote hostile to the Government which was given in the House of Commons. As soon, however, as a noble earl, not now in his place, stated in his address to your lordships on Monday night, not only on his own part, but for all those with whom he acted, that on the occasion in question not one of them had formed any eombination or understanding with any one who did not agree with him in political principle, I at onee gave credence to that statement. But I repeat that I will not go over that ground again. The noble earl (the Earl of Ellonborough) alluded in the con-So of his speech to the finances of India, and gave a very discouraging description of their present state, which he attributed entirely to the existing position of Chinese affairs. I confess I have not that acquaintance with Indian matters which the noble earl necessarily has; and I do not contend for one moment, when you are in a stato of hostilitywith any part of a countrywith which you have a considerable trade, that thatw wl not affectyour financial relations-with it; but when the nobIe earl talks with so much alarm about the state of the finances of India, I must say those finances must be in a very
unsound state indeed if they cannot afor the incon-
venience hich a certain temporary cessation of our relations with Canton may involve. (Hear, hear.) A great deal which the noble earl has said may be perfectly true. It is
imposaibleo for me to reply offhand to many of the state-
ments he has made to the House. The case of the fund-
holders to which the noble earl referred may be one of hardship; but the Government must deal with the exigencies of the public service as they arise, and if those exigencies re. quire an advance of money, thal advance of money can only be obtained by having recourse to an increase in the rate of interest in order to bring forward lenders on the occasion. The noble earl also talks of our commerce being interrapted at Canton. In one sense that is so, and in another sense it is not. Immense quantities of tea are on their way to the different ports, and therefore I do not see that there will be that stoppage in our trade with China which the noble earl seems to apprehend. But with reference to the trade in opium thero is no doubt that tho existing hosti-
lities do inflict injury upon it. But what does that co me to? Tuie noble earl complained the other night that the Governmnent had not done what it ought to put down the importation of opium into China, and he now complains of the aets of Sir John Bowring because indirectly they have the very effect with regard to the trade in opium which the
noble earl so much deires. ("Hear, hear," an d a laugh.) The noble earl noxt adverted to a subiect with respect to
whioh I entirely concuz with him, and that is the neceasity of economy on the part of the Governmnent at this time,
He has gone over several of the miscelaneons estimates
whic b I have no doubt are ca pablo of a satisfactor y explanation; but it will not be imagined, because I am not now giving am answer to all the details into which the noble earl has entered, and entered without having
previously given due notice that it was lis intention tosdo so (hear, hear), that a perfectly satisfactory reply cannot be given to them. (Hear, hear.) It would have beenmuch more satisfactory if points which are eaily susceptible of explana. tion and justificatioa had been brought forward separately, and with dae notice, at some other time when we have been sitting here than almost the last day of an expiring Parliament (hear, hear), because in that case I myself, or some of my colleagues, would have been prepared by inquiry previously made to give an answer to questions of that nature. (Hear, bear.) With regard to the money expended upon the parks to which the noble earl has allUded, I must remind him that those are public parks, and are not parks merely devoted to the enjoyment of the Sovereign. (Hear, hear.) Then, as to the question of printing, I quite agree with the noble earl that that Is an immense eviL It is an evil which is not confined to the money spent in printing, but has reference also to the enormous accumulation of returns for which demand is made from time to time in this and the other House of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) It is an evil, too, for which Parliament is not to blame, and certainly not Her Majesty's Government. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl has likewise referred to the expense of maintaining convicts. I dare say that is a subject susceptible of explanation if the details of it were investigated, but, however that may be, it is quite clear that the cessation of transportation has added enormously to the expenditare of the country under that head. He also complains that 60 new heads of expenditmu for special and temporary objects have been added within the last three years, or, as the noble earl says, during the Government of Lord Palmerston. Now, in the first place, the period of three yeaTs has not been the duration of Lord Palmerston's Government, seeing that Lord Aberdeen's Government was in office in the first of those tbree years. One thing has entirely escaped the observation of the noble earL which is that one of the lEst acts of Mr. C-ladstone, as ChanceUor of the Exche quer, was to transfer a great number of items of this sort from the con. solidated fund to the annual votes, (Hear, hear.) This, thereforo, is a mere transfer of charges, the only practical effect being to bring more directly under the control of Parliament the expenditure that takes place. (Hlear, hear.) The noblo earl then went to another subject,namely, the very largely increased expenditure in connexion with education. Now, on this point I have som difficulty in arguing with the noble earl. I think he mxus have seen the attention always paid by the occupants of this bench to the suggestions, patriotic and publc-spirited as they are, which he is frequently in the habit of making, to a Government, moreover, from which he differs, on questions with which he is thoroughly acquainted. such as military operations in the East, and other matters of that sort. But with respect to education I stand on a different footng to the noble earl. I could argue, for instance, with a man who maintained that there should be greater moderation in diet, and I could admit to him the extravagance of indulging in turtle and champagne; but if I met with a person who held that pure air was the only thing necesssry for the support of life, and that meat and drink were quite a mistake, I should decline to argue with him as to the economy or extravagance of any dietary whatever. (" Hear " and a laugh.) In the same way the noble earl and I start from a wholly different point with regard to education. I remember perfectly well that in the Indian debates the noble earl threatened us almost with the loss of an empire if we attempted the education of our subjects there. On a subsequent occasion perhaps some of your lordships can call to mind that he referred with a sigh to the money wasted on the education of the people, which might, he said, have been usefully employed in the construction of gunboats (laughter); and I am perfectly sure the noble earl, at the bottom of his heart, thinks that the sum of money spent upon education is thrown away. On this subject I may, in passing, express my surprise that Mr. Gladstone the other night in a thin House, and without any notice whatever, should make a charge of extravagance with regard to these votes against the department of which I am at the head. I should meet Mr. Gladstone, however (though with very unequal weapons) upon perfectly equal ground. I should say to him, " We agree on the advantages of educating the people; we sat together for three years in the same Committee of Council on Education, during which period you were Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in aU that time we did not in theleastdiffer as to the extravagance of the estimates of that committee, except npon one very contemptible point," which I remedied immediately after he left the Government. I might remind him, too, that the capitation grant was approved by him as a member of the committee, and corrected and amended by him as Chancelor of the Exchequer; so, with him, I say, let us go carefully one by one through the items and see whether we can agree as to the economy or extravagance of the expenditure. Now, I declare most positively that, following the noble marquis below me (the Marquis of LAnsdowne) in this department, my great object has been to make that system efficent, but yet as economical as possible. (Hear, hear.) I believe it was once stated that the ChanceDor of the Exchequer was the most economical member in the House of Commons. for he war constautly saying " No !" and trying to reduce expenditure. Bnt in the Committee of Council we are placed in almost the same position. Hardly a day passes in which persoRs of influence and important bodies do not come and beg us to remove one or other of seseral stringent conditions, very plausibly urging that our requirements should be less; and I am sure that if we yielded to these requests we might easily increase our expenditure by 25 or 50 per cent. My lords, when the noble earl (the Earl of Derby) who sits opposite, and who I regret is not in his place, put forward the other day education as one of the cries upon which the Conservative party would appeal to the country, I could not help remarking that he ought to give some intimation as to whether he adopts the views of Mr. Henley or Sir John Pakington upon this subject, or whether he endorses the opinions as to the advantages of popular ignorance pecuiar to the noble earl (Ellenborough). ("Hear,3 hear," and a laugh.) Economy is certainly avery popular cry ,and it is one vwhich I am clad to hear raised, because I think a pressure of that sort is useful as regards any Government whatever. (Hear.) But I should te ashamed of my colleagues if I did not think they would exert themselves to the utmost to economize the public expenditure; and they are perfectly
;illing to discuss and to entertain that queston of economv at the proper time, provided due regard be paid to the efficiciency of the naval and military services. The cry of economy, however, may be a very vague one, and may be very much misapplied. (Hear.) The noble earl has given his experience of the House of Commons. When I was there I remember a. man as much the opposite of the noble earl as possible-I mean Mr. Joseph Hume. He was anything but an orator, and was characterized by the very reverse of that clearness of expression which is only possessed by persons, like the noble earl, of finished education - buxt he effected great good by repressing the extravagant expenditure of successive Governments. What, however, was Mr. Hume' aconduct? Did his love of economylead him to oppose grants for the advancement of science and education? No I I do not believe there was in the country a person whose support could be more surely reckoned upon in Parliament with regard to charges (which after all 'constitute only one-half: per cent. of your total expenditure) applied to raise the intellectual and social condition of the country. I have only one more remark to make, and that is with reference to the noble earl's attack upon the principles of Lord Palmerston. Now I stated the other night why I thought Lord Palmerston entitled to the confidence of the counltr. I am not going over the ground again and for this simple reason-that I believe the country will not form their opinion upon statements made either by the noble earl who has just spoken or by the noble earl who addressed the House last Monday, nor will they form their opinion from any defence which so insignificant a person as I could offer. I believe the public will decline to receive the opinions both of political adversaries and of political partisans, and that they will judgo and in fact have judged, for themselves. (Hear, hear.} Ioel that it is unnecessary for me to offer a single word m reply to the observations-certainlyof rathera personal character-made by the noble lord on this Point. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of MAL1ESBIIRY was unwilling to weaken the force of the very able and eloquent speech made by his noble friend (the Earl of Ellenborough), but could not help repeating, very much in his words, that it was extremely likely the public might decide, when appealed to from the hustings, that Lord Palmerston was a most popular and
most desirable Minister. But he was equally convinced with his noble friend that the time was not far distant when the people of England, so practial, so famous for their com-
mon sense, so prone to investigate the truth of every matter which interested them, would feel convinced that the war -with China was one most disastrous to their interests, and that their present idol had especially neglected the duty of enforcing economy in the national expenditure during the time he had been Prime Minister of this country. (Hear.) The noble earl who had just sat down could not throw off responsibility even as regarded the years which preceded Lord Palmerston's premiership, and must be held accountable for the expenditure on education previous to that time. Now, he (the Earl of Malmesbury) was not here to discuss one system of education with another, but he should have been glad to see that the attention of the Government was directed to the great increase of expenditure upon this item, instead of leaving the Opposition to point out the increase. Then, too, systems of education had been proposed by Lord John Russell, by Sir John Pakington, and by Mr. Henley; but to his recollection not a single plan on this subject, be. yond the one already in operation, had been brought forward by the noble earl opposite (Earl Granville). He wished to ask his noble friend whether he had any definite idea of the extent to which the expenditure would go on under the present system, and what would be the aggregat
an aked for from Parliament a few years hence? A man might desire to educate the people, and yet might wish for some more definite system than that now in operation-ene in which the country would be able to see some probable limit to the exenditare incurred under it. It was impossible, even in thatlHouse, where'their lordships had noprac-
tical power with re,.ard to tho national expendituro, not to look with astonishmuent at the increaso in the mitu.ilaneoas estimates, amounting, as they did to 2,000,0001C during the Government of Earl Grey, and now to 6,400,0001. The noble earl, when ho laid the Income-tax BiU upon their lordships table had observed a solemn silence, nor had he in his reply to the speech of his noble friend on Monday last spent five minutes upon the question of the estimates, wheni he answered, or attempted to anstwer, the two or three questions raised by his noble friend- and that vary evening, indeed, he hiad appeared to waive the subject as3 one which could not well bo entertained in their lordshi p
House. He wished, however, to cal their lordahips' attuntion to an item of expenditure to rwhic as yet no reference had been made-namely, the extraordinary expenses of collection. (hear, hear.) The revenue in round rcoletion was
000,000;n , nand the expense of collecting it amouhted to no la tan 4,w0,01 or rather core tiaz (1 per cent. Their odeips well ke what was the c ait of collecting their pnivate revenues, much of which was derived fronm sources of a very miscellaneous character, and which occasioned great difficulty, in its colke-tion;- for instance, take the case of the collection of tithes.' He knew a case in which several thousand poinds were col-
lected, the greater part of which was paid in sums varyingI from ws. or fs. to 11. or 21., and the gentleman who collecto I those tithes charged only 26 per cent, for his services-a pear centago rather above what their lordships generally paid for the collection of their incomes. If, then, 2A per cent. was the cost of the colection of private revenuesv, it was, he thought, a fair question to ask the President of the Council how it was that 65,000,0001. could not be collected at a lower -rate than 6 per cnt. Reference had been made to the personal qualifications of Lord Palmerston as a Ministur. Into that question ha did not wish to enter, for the country would shortly decide whether he was to be MNinister or not, but there was one point to which he wished for a moment to advert. The noble earl, in answering on Monday evening the observations made by his noble friend as to the qaalifications of Lord Palmerston had based his reply upon the fact that his noble friend isad himnself invited Lord Palmerston to take office uinder him. Now, from the great official experience and the ability of Lord Palmerston, he might be an acquisition to any Cabinet, but it was a very different thing to invite a man to serve Lnder one s-self and to support him as Prime Minister. (Hear, hear.) Tho same quahties which might make a man fit for the highest subordinate office did not necessarily render him fit to be a Prime Minister. No doubt the noble earl the President of the Council was well satisfied with his present colleagues, but, he begged to ask him, would he be equa y satisfied to have any one of them sitting abovo hun as Prime Minister 7 He should think not; and therefore it was no reply to his noble friend (Lord Derby) to say that he himself had invited Lord Palmerston to be a coleague. As regarded the question of expenditure, he trusted that the Government would well consider it. He saw in all quarters signs and symptorms of alarm at the generel increase of expenditure, and the noble carl might rely upon it that the expenditure of the country required the closest supervision and examination. Five or six years ago the subject was not of so much importance, but now 40,000,0001. had been added to the debt of the country and we had only finished one great war to embark in anot er, which might be extremely costly. He begged to impress upon the Government that it was only by the most careful attention to the minutino referred to by his noble friend that they would be able to defend those military estimates which they would, he feared, for some years be obliged to lay before Parliament. (Rear, hear.)
Lord MONTEAGLE rose to corroborate in the strongest manner the observations of the noble earl opposite (Lord Ellenborough) with respect to the national expenditare. (Hear, hear.) As regarded the present estimates they were not, ho hoped, those by which the Government intended to abide and which would be ultimately submitted to Parliament, and ho was confirmed in that anticipation by having read the economical principles so freely and candidly expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was the duty of Parliament to give effect to such principles by giving to the Government of the day power and authority to refuse to multiply the claims upon it. The present expenditure was most reekless and extravagant. It was the fashion now to attribute aU the increase of expenditure to the war, and no doubt the suddenness with which hostilities were commenced, combined with other causes, had rendered the war as costly as any war in which England had been engaged ; bat the real secret of this rash expenditure was to be found in the prindple that there was no such stimulus to extravagance as a large amount of borrowed moneyThe wise economy of past times had been disturbed by the arguments of many who were now compeUed to come forward as advocates of economy. It was possible he might be accused of combination or conspiracy (a laugh), but he thought he would be protected from such a charge when he expressed his conviction that the manner in which the Government had dealt with the estimates and expenditure during the short period that had elapsed since the war termninated was most creditable to them. The economical measures adopted by the Government had certainly exceeded his expectations, for they liad effected a reduction of 20,000,0001. in the estimates for one year, and a further reduction of 17,000,0001. in the succeeding year. But while he gave the Government fulU credit for their reductions of expenditure and of taxation, he must teU them that the present estimates could not be maintained in future years. He -was satisfied that the people and their representatives would insist upon the fulfiltment of the contract into which Parliament had enteredfor the cessation of the income-tax in 100. (Rear.) If, however, much more considerable reductions than had yet been proposed were not effected in the estimates, they might rest assured that this object could not be accomplished. [Lord Lyndhurst, who was sitting on the cross-benches, here made an observation to the noble lord, which was inaudible in the galery.] He (Lord Monteagle) believed the prophecy of the noble and learned lord would not be fulfilled bat that the income-tax would be abandoned in 1860, anu hehopedthenobleandlearnedlordmightbeamongthenumber of thosewho wouldwitnessthatresult. (Hear.) They knov, from what occurred ix the case of Lord Liverpool's Government and in 1848, the beneficial consequences of compeUing Government to reconsider their own estimates - and if Her Majesty'sGovernmenteould beinduced to place the estimates upon the footing on which they stood anterior tothe war they would undoubtedly be able to dispense with the income-tax in 1860. An addition of 2,000,0001. a-year, for which the presentGovernment were not responsible, had been made to the expenditure in consequence or the engagements which were entered into by Mr. Gladstone-as he thought most unwisely-during the war. By those engagements the country was saddled with an expenditure of 2,000,000f. a-year for three successive years, while no provision was marle as to the source from which that amount was to be obtaineJ. He also considered that the arrangement made by Mr. Gladstone with re&ard to a sinking fund was most unwise. Instead of applying the surplus of income over expenditure to the reduction of debt, Parliament, at that right hon. gentleman's suggestion, entered into a contract to pay 1,500,0001. a-year, for a certain number of years, as a sinking fund. He thought, however unwise it might have been to commence that system, good faith required that the arrangement should be carried out. Every man in England now understood that the battle of economy was to be fought upon a new principle, and that every vote that could be reduced was a step towards the abolition of the income-tax. Preparations were being made in Westminster-hall for the exhibition of designs for new public offices. Now, was the expenditure for that purpose to be 1,000,0001., 2,000,0004, or 3,000,0001. 9 The moderate sum of 80,0001. had already been voted on account, and he need only remind their lordships of the immense expenditure which had been made upon the building in which they were then assembled (hear, hear) as a warning against the repetition of such extravagant folly. EIe bolieved the proposal to erect new public offices at great expense originated in a miserable desire to rival a foreign country, and in all probability the attempt would prove a failure. Why, he would ask, should they decorate, at vast expense, all their public offices, however insignificant the purposes for which many of them were used ? (Hear, hear.) He feared that past extravagance had excited a disposition to persevere in a similar course, but he hoped the Government might abandon their present intentions. He beheved, whatever cries might now be raised-whether cnies against our Chinese poaCy, or cries in favour of Lord Palmerstonthat, when the new Parliament assembled, it would be found that the people of England were determined to enforce one principle-namely, a diminution of expenditure in the present and succeeding years, with a view of fulfiling the solemn engagement entered into by Parliament with the country that in 1860 the property-tax should cease and determnine. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GREY.-I cannot allow this occasion to pass without expressing my entire concurrence in the opinion of my noble friend who last spoke, and of the noble earl opposite, with respect to the importance of enforcing great economy in the puble expenditure and the alarming system of extravagance which has been pursued of late years. I cannot, however, concur with the noble earl opposite in r.garding that extravagance as confined to the civil expenditure of the country. In my opinion it pervades the whole of our naval and military
expenditure, particularly the latter. I am the last person in the world to recommend that an inadequate army should bo maintained. I am most anxious, on the contrary, that the army should be kept up in a state of the highest efficiency,-though I believe that it is at present in many respects far from being in that state of efficiency which is desirable; but, while I would have our army as per'ect as possible, I no less strongly insist upon the doctrine that it ought to be kept up on a small scale in point of numbers, and with reference to defensive objects only. (Eloar, hear.) When I compare the army estimates laid on the table for this year with those of former years I cannot help remarking, that, while the demands upon our army have been greatly reduced, its strength and cost have been greatly increased. The state of Ireland happily no longer requires that large force which in former years was indispensable for the maintenance of the peace and security of that portion of Her Majesty's dominions; in our colonies the demands upon our military force have been greatly reduced; in the last 10 years you have established throughout the country gonerally an efficient police force, by which your army is relieved from duties which never ought to have been imposed upon it; nnd yoU have at the same time organized a militia, which, if it is worth a very small part only of its cost, ought to enableyou to someextenttoreduceyourregular army; but still, with all these aids for a diminished military expenditure, tho pace establishment now proposed is the largest, I believe, which has ever been sanctioned by Parliament, and is more expensive, as compared vith former years, than is proportionate to tho mere incre-tse of
nuber8. I cannot 'help inferring from these estimates
that the'policy now adopted is that of keeping up an army upon such a scale as would enable us at a very short notice to carry on great foreign wars. Against that principle I entirely protest. For defensive purposes, and for those only, I am wiiing to give whatever is necessary. For defensive purposes you do not want a large army. Knowing as I do the spirit of the country, and feeling assured that should any real danger threaten the country all classes, from the highest to the lowest, would rush forward to defend their nativo land, I am persuaded that a higly disciplined and efficient army of moderate numbers, thus supported, is quite safficient for the protection of the country. But if we are to proceed upon the notion that we ought to be ready at a short notice to take the field in continental wars, then I maintain we are acting upon a totaUy erroneous principle. (Hear, hear.) If you adopt this principle you will necessarily incur an expenditure which will render absolutely impossible that abolition of the income-tax to which my noble friend who spoke last attaches such importance. Bait, more than that, I am persuaded that the maintenance of an army which has any reference whatever to our being hereafter engaged in offensive operations is a mistake in policy. Other nations vill be provoked to foUow our example, and when nations are armed a much slighter cause of quarrel is sufficient to bring them to blows than when they are not prepared. In private life we know that when a sword was part of the recognized dress of a gentleman, duels and brawls, ending in bloodshed, were unfortunately of very frequent occurrence ; and one step towards the great improvement in the manners of the country by which these disgraceful contests have been put an end to was the giving up the system of carrying arms. Thus it is with nations- if all nations are to be habitually prepared for war, a very small cause will be sufficient to lead to war. And after all, what shall we gain by such a policy 9 If we increase our force other nations will increase theirs, and thus we shall still continue to stand in the same relative positions of strength to each other, to say nothing of the additional pressure which we shall put upon the industry and enterprise of ourcountry. The last war affords indubitable proof that what reaUy adds to the power of a country is, by moderating during peace the demands upon its strength, and by giving encouragement to its industry and commerce, to increase its wealth and resources. At all times I think it i*ost important to act upon the principle of a moderate peace establishment, and the importance of our doingso is unfortunately inereasedbywhsathastagen place in the present year. Icannot help viewing with great alarm the relaxation of that old constitutional rule which laid do,n the uecessity of the control of Parliament over the Executive Government in that most important of aU their duties, the determination of questions of peace and war. In old times all the great Parliamentary leaders of all parties concurred in the opiniont that, while makiog war was a prerogative of the Crown, it was a prerogative of such importance that it was the duty of Parliament to exercise the most stringent control over the Ministers upon whose advice this prerogative was exercised. I cannot forget that in this last year, for the first time, I believe, since our constitution was settled-for the first time since the revolution of 1680, -Parliament has deliberately passed by the fact that Her Majesty's Government, by their own authority, have engaged this country in a war and have made arrangements nith the East India Com pany in respect to the proportion of the expenses of that war which was to be defrayed from the taxation of England. For the first time in our history, I believe, a measure of this kind has been taken without Parliament being summoned, or any sanction being obtained fromithe representatives of the people for the war which has been commenced or for the expenses which it will occasion. Parliament has passed by, and has submitted without notice to this departure fromn all ancient principle, aind it is now on, the eve of dissolution withouxt havIng any accurate information submitted to it as to the circumastances which led to that war, or as to the justification which Her Majestys Government may have for the steps which they have taken My regret for the relaxation of our constitutional principle is alsoverymuch increazedbysomethingelse whichhas occurred very lately. We learn from statements made in this House and from the ordinary sources of information, that a largo expedition, involving a necessary expenditure to a very large amount indeed, with the probability of a continued and growing expenditure, is now leaving our shores to carry on a war which one House of Parliatuent has declared to be unjustifiable in its origin, and which, though your lordships refused to condemn it, I believe all who hoar me will bear me out in saying, it is pretty notorious, only escaped condemnation on the politi. cal ground that you thought it inexpedient to censure the advisers of the Crown, and not because you approved what had been done. But this expedition is now leaving our shores to carry on a war without our having any informa. tion, as the noble earl opposite has said, of the objects of that war as to what we propose to obtain, or on whatterms we shaU be prepared to make peace. Parliament and the country are utterly in the dark on these points, and Parlia. inent has consented to grant money for the carrying on of these hosttlities withoutha,vin gany inform,ation in referencotc them. Withthe opinionsinwhichIwaseducatedastothegreat importance of maintaining the constitutional check of Parliament upon the measures of the advisers of the Crown, especially upon that greatest of all prerogatives-the power of making peace and war I cannot help viewing what has passed upon these points in the present year with great alarm. 1Ihope that when the new Parlament meets it will be found not only to be actuated by a stronger spirit of economy than that which is now about to separate, but also to possess a greater regard for those old constitutional maxims which have been handed down to us by our ancesthrs.

Sir,-If the "Lover of Art," whose letter appeared in Dw ~Timrns of yesterday, is really desirouis that the persons who as,sisted Mr. Kean in the revival of Richard 1I. (so admirably reviewed in your columns) should have due credit given to them, he would have showvn that feeling more clearyly had he quoted correctly from the p reface to the play that gentleman's acknowledgments for the particular services they had rendered him.
The " Lover of Art " states that Mr. Kean acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Salvin ana Mr. George Godwin for the arechitectural scenes so admirably painted by Mr. Grieve and his assistants, and gives his thanks to Mr. Henry Shaw and Mr. Scbarf for aid as to cosuinne and other matters.
Mr. 'Kean's statement is that "the Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh castles, the Traitor's-gate at the Tower, and St. George's-hail, at Windsor, have been painted uander the authority of Mr. Salvin. To e r. Shaw I am indebted for much zealous asistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings and superintending the preparations for the combat at Coventry, the bedroom scene of the dying John of Gaunt, and many of the accessories introduced into other scenes.

The days of embarcation are not fxed. The officers of the 23d Royal Welsh Fusileers have just presented a very handsome testimonial, in the shape of a silver tea and coffee service, bearing an appropriate inscription, to Surgeon W. Godfrey Watt, of the 23d, who is leaving the regiment, as a mark of their high estimation of his skill and character since he has been associated with them in the service.
Her Majesty's screw three-decker Deke of WeUington 131, Captain Caldwell, C.B., flag of Rear-Admiral the Hon Sir R. S. Dundas, K.C.B., arrived at Spithead from the Tagus yesterday afternoon.
Lieutenant-Colonel R. N. Phillips and a board of officers telonging to the Provisional Battalion have been ordered to assemble at Chatham for the purpose of examining the records of the whole of the troops to the 31st of December last, in order to ascertain whether they have been correctly kept up to that period. The Board was ordered by the authorities at the Horse Guards.
A general inspection of the Artillery corps, in garrison at Sheerness, took place yesterday by Colonel Teesdale and Colonel Bingham, Assistant-Adjutant-General. The principal cause of inspection was to select men from the ranks, to effect the reduction of 1,100 men in the entire Artilery corps. After the parade inspeetion they were marched off to man their respective battery guns, where they were also inspected at quarters in divisions; after which Captain Green's company, 2d compauy, 12th battalion, were paraded in heavy marching order, and went through their various evolutions in a manner reflecting the highest credit on their officers and themselves.
The Dolphin, 3, Commander E. Webber, which was paid off at Chatham yesterday, has been in commission since 1853, during the whole of which period she bas been em. ployed cruising upon the southern and western coasts of Africa, for the repression of the slave trade. She was stationed at Congo for some months, and also for a short period at Loando. The Dolphin succeeded in capturing two slave vessels, which were fitted up for that traffic. Daring the whole time sbe was in commission the crew were more healthy than those in any vessel on that station. On leaving Sierra Leone to return to England with invalids the Dolphin left the following vessels on the coast :-The Scourge, 6, steamvessel, bearing the flag of Commodore J. Addams; the Sappho, 12; the Childers, 12; the Hecla, 6; the Hecate, fi; the Alecto, 5; and the Teazer, 2, steamscrew gunvessel, Commander W. H. Grubbe; the blinx, 3, iron gunvessl, Lieutenant-Commander R. H. Roe, was hourly expected at Sierra Leone.
The Eleotra, 14, sloop, Commander W. Mor-is (1852), from the Australian station, is ordered to Chatham to be paid off into ordinary.
Captain W. Cossar, of the Chatham division of Royal Marines, employed on recruiting service in London, has been appointed Paymaster of the Portsmouth division, tice Captain J. Lawrence, deceased.
Captain Robert Talbot, Lieutenant Charles W. Walrond, and 47 ganners of the 7th company 10th battalion Royal Artillery, who arrived on Wednesday from Bermuda in the freightship Norman Morrison, were yesterday morning paraded at head-quarters, Woolwich, and, having been inspected by Colonel Hardinge, KH., acting commandant of the garrison, they were ordered to be reinforced from the reserve detachment of the battalion, and held in readiness f or home station duty. The company went out to Bermuda full strength, in command of CaptainFrederic!k Woodhouse, and in September, 1853, shortly after their arrival, they were attacked with malignant fever, which raged with fearful fatality, and carried off during three successive months, September, October, and NOvember, Captin Woodhouse, Lieutenant the Hon. G. V. A. Ellis, and 40 non-commissioned officers and men of the company. In February of the following year a draught of 45 gunners was sent out to fill up the vacancies, and in September, 1855, a batch of 2-5 men volunteered for service in the Russian war. The strength was considerably curtailed by sickness, consequently a number of invalids wero ordered home, reducing the collective amount to a total, as abovenamed, of 49 officers, non-commissioned, and men of all ranks.
The brigado of Royal Marines off duty, mustering aboul 600 rank and file, were yesterday morning inspected by Colonol-Commandant Brown in the barrack-square, and, preceded by the band of the regiment, were marched to Woolwich-common in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming, Lieutenant-Colonel Hopldns, and the respective subaltern officers, for the purpose of going through a course of field exercise and musket drill. The weather was extremely favourable for battalion exercise and field drill, which are ordered to be continued weekly, weather permitting. A number of Artillery recruits were likewise exercised on the Common and fired several rounds of blank eartridge.
Captain Knox, Captain Middleton, Major Barstow, and Captain Longden's companies of the Royal Artillery at Woolwich, under orders for China, are to attend rocket practice to-day in the Arsenal marshes, and are to be in. speoted by the Colonel-Commandant on Monday morning, prior to embareation, the period of which is at present un. eecided.
The Royal Ordnance sloops Lord Raglan, Alma, and Lord Vernon, are being laden with 68-pounder guns, carriages, shot, and other war materials from the Military Store Department of Woolwich Arsenal for the Charnel Islands. The freight ship Earl of Eglintoun, in the London doeks, is shipping guns and war stores from Woolwich Arsenal for Hongkong. The Armyntus is embarking a similar cargo for Corfu; the Scotia, for Halifax; and the Pearl, for Quebec and Montreal.
The neor forge at Pembroke dockyard is to be immediately carried on, the necessary excavations having been made, and, as this building is much needed, the contractor will push it forward with all despatch. The masonry portion of the new building slip, No. 12, has just been completed in a very satisfactory manner. The contract for the roof over this slip hasbeen taken, and is immediately to be proceeded with. Several new works have yet to be tendered for. Orders have been received by the authorities to discharge immediately all the hired men on the establishment. These are prlceipally labourers, and a few joiners. The contraetors hawve discharged a number of masons and their labourers so that the establishment is gradually being reduced to a much lower scale.

On Thursday afternoon an important meeting of the electors of Berkshire was held in the Town-hall, Newbury, to consider the present representation of the county, with theview to introduceanew candidate, pledged to suyport the present Govermnent. Several hundred freeholders were present, and among them was a good number of county magistrates. Major Court was voted to the chair.
'The Right Hon. E. P. Bouyxsts addressed the meeting, and, after expressing his entire approval of the course taken by the Government on the Chinese question, went on to say that a still wider question, however, was submitted to this country, jybich was, what form of government they thought right for carying on the public business. Lord Palrrerston proposed to appeai h the country to say whether they approved his conduct gelnerally sinco he had been called to the head of affairs. Aithougia ho (lr. Bouverie) w,as a humble member of that Government, he mrust make bold to say that Lord Palmerston eminently deserved the gratitude of the people at large. (Loud cheers.) He came to the bead of affairs in an hour of great difficulty, uhen ruen's hearts were failing them; he came at a time when some statesmen were unwiRng to grapple with the difficulties; he came forward resolutely and boldly, and carried the country safely through the difficulties they had to encounter, and brought that terrible aLd bloody war to a most prosperous and successfal issue. If in no other respect, yet in this he conscientiously believed that Lord Palmerston was deserving of the gratitude of the people. (Cheers.) In addition to this, Lord Palmerston was eminently a man who represented British feeling, British character, and British pluck, if he might Hse the word (hear, hear); and he should be greatly mistaken if the constituencies of England, Scotland, and Ireland also, did not show in some unmistakeable manner the opinions they entertained of the noble Premier's conduct. (Loud cheers.) These were observations indirectly relative to the issue submsitted to the constituencies generally, but they paved the way for the remarks he had to make on the particular object of the meeting. As a resident in Berkshire he must say, whatever opmnions might be entertained by others, that he was not satisfied with the present *tate of the representation of the county of Berks. (Cheers.) He always deeply regretted the course which was taken with regard to his hon. and distinguished relative, the late Mr. Pasey, for he was a man of great attainments, of European reputation, and whose heait was in the welfare of tho agricultural interest. They had now, however, to consider what should be done in i eference to the future representation. He himself was anxious to promote those principles which he believed to be sound in Church and State, and to assist the county in getting a representation which they might regard with satisraction. Everyone who had carefully studied publc events forthe last 10 or20 yeas mustadmit that we could not stand still in these times, and which were eminently times of progress, improvement, and reform. (Cheers.) If we were to stand still we must be content to stereotype our position, and to see other countries pass by us, and should at last arrive at difficulty and trouble. The constant improvement going on enabled us to avoid this evil. Those who were Reformers were improvers; but those who were Conservatives wished to stand still,-they wished to have no improvement; they thought that all was right, and that nothing could be improved. However, he was one who thought differently. He thought that reform was the true principle; but whether it was the principle they thought trne or not, it was the principle on which this country had been goirg for the last 15 or 20 years. (Cheers) Every one who looked back during that period would see that great changes bad taken place, and that such changes had been for the advantage of the public. If that was so, what a confirmation that was of the wisdom of those who said that we ought to go on with progressive reform. That was the sound principle on which the affairs of this country should be conducted. That was the faith of a great many electors of the connty of Berks, but that faith was not practised by either of the present representatives. (A cry of "They don't reptesent us.") If the votes of those gentlemen were examined, it would be found that on every question like advancement-that on everything like a change for what was called the better-the votes of Mr. R. Palmer, Lord Barrington, and Mr. Vansittart, bad been uniformly recorded for standing still. (Hear, hear.) He would therefore say that those in this county who considered reform to be the true principle had no representative in the House of Commons; and he considered that it was high time that they should seek for a fair share of that representation. He trusted that they would succeed in getting a candidate who would at all events represent the opmions of the Liberal electors of the county. He had been asked to offer himself to their snffrages, being connected with the county; yet, while he admitted that nothing would sfford him greater satisfaction than to be a member for this important county, he had been connected with a constituency in the North which had continued to return him for seoveral Parliaments, and he feit he should be wanting in faith and honour to them if he abandoned them and sought another representation. He had no doubt but that they wonld readily find some one who would really represent the principles of tho great body of electors. In reference to this subject he had to propose the following resolution *-
" That in the opinion of e;s meeting it appears expKdient to pro - peo sa a candidate at the ensuing election, to the electors of Berkshire, a gentleman who wiU give an indeDendent saupport to Hey 5&ajeats's Govcrnment, and wbo will unite the suLfragez of the Liberal electors by edvocatlng the principles of progressive reform." (Land applause.)
Mr. CRAY seconded the motion of the right hon. gentlemian.
Mr. LovsRzY wished it to be understood that many of them who were there, because it was market-day, were not Liberals, and that they did not want a contest in the county. He thought they were very well represented, and he would move as an amendment that the county was very weol represented by the present members. (Cheers and disapprobation.) it had been said that this was an age of reform and improvement, but he was one who entertained the opinon that half the so-called reforms were not improvements. (Laughter.) HIe wished for no more alterations, and hoped the present representation would not be d&turbed.
The amendment was seconded by another Mr. Lousrxy.
The CHAIR)MfAN put the amendment, when about half-a. dozen hands were held up, and a large number against it. It was thereupon declared to be negatived. The original resolution was put and carried by an overwhelming majority.
Mr. GRAY remarked that the county had been very inadequately represented, for M1r. Vansittart, who was chiefly returned on account of his opposition to the Maynooth grant, had been absent during the present session, and paired off against the Government on every measure. Be was happy to have a candidate to name, and therefore proposed-
"That the Hon. Philip Pleydell Bouverie, beinga gentleman well known for his high character and capacity for business, and connected by hs family with this county, will be a fit and proper person to bo nominated as a candidate."
Mr. W. SAu DERS seconded the motion.
MIr. GRuAHA, a solictor, said, although Mr. Bouverie named in the motion, was related to a family of distinction in the county, yet he was not a resident or owner of property here. He moved as amendment-
"That it is highly inexpedient that this county ahoult return t, Psrlament as Its representative any gentleman who is not imme. diately interested in the connty as a landowner."
Mr. BRowN- seconded the amendment.
The CirIiRtAx put the amendment to the vote, and it was negatived. The original motion was put and carried.
Thanks were voted to the Chairman, and the meeting broke up.
Mr. Bouverie, it was said, will issue his address this week, and at once commence a canvass of the county.
It has been ascertained since this meeting that Lord Barrington does not intend to contest the county. An address to the electors from his lordship to that effect will in a few hours be distributed.
DOVEP.
On Monday evening a densely crowded meetin of the Liberal electors took place at the Apollonian-hall for the purpose of affording the candidates in that interest an opportunity of expressing their poltical sentments. The candidates invited to offer themselves were Mr. Bernal Osborne, the Secretary forthe Admiralty, and Captain Edward Rice, R.N., son of the present representative of Dover. Captain Riceissued an address on gaturday, but early on Monday morning it was rumoured that the gallant Captain had retired, and this rumour was soon strengthened by an address from Sir William RusselL offering himself as a candidate on advanced Liberal opinions. This was immediately followed by a short placard bearing the name of Captain Rice, and formally announcing his intention to wit-hdraw from the contest, on the ground that by so doing he would best aid the cause of Liberalism in Dover. The chair was occupied by MIr. James Worsfold, who was supported by a large number of influential members of the Liberal and independent body.
Mr. Bni BAL OSBORNE, addressing the meeting as " electors, freemen, and non-electors of Dover," said he had not been driven here as to a harbour of refuge. (A laugh.) He, moreover, ventured to hope that in this case there would be no exaction of "passing tolls." ("IHear," and laughter.) Fortunately for himself he had had-he said it with great humility-numerous requisitions from other constituencies, which had done him the honour to invite his humble services for their representation. But it might well be asked him, " Why have you, representing as you do profitably one of the most important constituencies, if not the most important constituency, in Great Britain (he meant the county of Middlesex) whv have you left that constitueney, and why do you'stand here before the electors
or t over I t ie should make free to answer those ques-
tions. It so happened, in the course of his Parliamentary career, that, without soliciting office-being independert in his circamstances and position-the complirent was paid him of being asked to join Her jesty'r Government. Thatwas at thetime when the celebrated coalition took place, which looked so fair, but which had ended in dust and ashes. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Considering that it was not an unlaudable ambition to aspire to office in this country, if unaccompanied with disgraceful conditions, he accepted that invitation; but the county business of Middlesex was so great, and the local interests were so varied, that it was totally impossible for any m cant holdin the position of amember for Middlesex and Secretary tor the Admiralty to do the business of one without neglecting that of the other. For these' reasons he had lately, with great pain-fo3 r he was not one of those who liked to leave old friends and old supporters-iadoe up his mind to resig the trust hbhehld as the representative of Middlesex. He had heard since his arrival in thi town that two gentlemen were about to make their appearance here who he felt justi-
fSed in saying, from his knowledge of their career, were mA politics neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, nor, what he was sure
was agreat inty this town, goodredherring. (Laughter. )One gentlemnan was, hebelieved, known totheelectors of Dover-he spoke of Sir George Clerk, whom they would
hobbybiro the following ni ht, Sir George Clerk, lthiLwarn the electors of Dtover, was not the Sir George Clerk they saw hero in 1847. At that time the hon. baronet was brought in by the Liberal electorx of this town. He came for. ward as a free-trader, and-that anomalous animal -a "ILiberal Conservative"' Now, if there was any
rnore s,pecious animal in the political worldl, any more deceeivinig, Any Wolf in sheep's clothing greater than another, it WS hewhotold them lie was a Liberal Conservative. Heteeoewarned every Liberal elector in that roomfor Sir George Clerk was "a Calilnie Scotchman," and ho knew frora long experience how to wheedle a vote (laughter) -he warned every Liberal elector in that room that thiswas not the Sir George Clerk of 1847. Ano ther gentleman now came to Dover holding fasthby Sir Georgo Clerk's tail;' and he (Mr Osborne) scarcely dou~bted that the Dover electors would keep him there. (" Hear," andl a laugh.) His name was Hlope; ana he sincerely thought that in this case Hope was wpithout an anchor. (Laughter.) Under any circunistances, he would scarcely find a good holding in tile harbour of Dover. (Hear, hear.) The electors, like himself, had no doubt been mnuch astonishedl at what had lately occurred. When the present Parliament rust no cloud %wa apparent on the political hiorizon. It scarcely needed a Palmerston or a Smithett to steer the ship across the political channel. But what had occurred? Probably one of the moat remarkable mean of this or any other day, instigated by passion, possibly by disappoinitmenit,
oslybambition,-a man who to the enidowments of an ilatium 4yol&t ;dednot only the tognpe of a Deinosthenes, but the impulses of a Tiw4 Indian-for he scalped his enemnies-had organized a very serious opposition to Lord Pal. mnerston. He referred to M[r. Gladstonec, who was the acknowledged head of the party which was generally called the Peelite party, and of which he believed Sir George Clerk and M1r. Hope were members, although he was not certain as to Sir George Clerk. Mr. Gladstone was now hand in hand with his right hon. friend Mr. Disraeli. And ho would warn hon. gentlemen that of all friendshis they should be chary in forming right bon. friendships - for the friend of to-day was the enemy of to-mnorrow. SIr Gladstone, then, had coalesced-and that it was a coalition he did not hesitate to say, for Mr. Gladstone had not denied it himself -he hadi coalesced with that vers-atie and very able gentleman Mr. Disraeli for the pupoe of expellig Lord Palmerston frmpwr An ht wa-s his first mnove ? With a power of utterance and a mystification of language of which it was totally impossible for him (Xr. Osborne) to ive any ide, he endxeavoured to prove, when Sir CornewaliLewis, with a sagacity of purpose well becoming a Chancellor of the Exchequer, br6u-ht forward in his budget a proposition to take from the inco3me-tax what was generally kniown as the "1war 9d?'-1r. Gladstone endeavoured to prove that in place of takinag off this 9d. he was taking onf nothing at alL. In such a wilderness of words did he involve the subject that one might have pardoned poor Sir Cornewall Lewis for being left under the impression that, after all, he had not in reality taken the 9d. off the income-tax. (A laugh.) Happily for every pro. prieter of a breeches pocket, Mr. Gladstone was unsuccessful in his attack. All had read-no, he hoped all had not read-the Chinese debate. Ho had the misfortune to listen to it for four nights. Lawyer aftegr lawyer rose and confused asplain and simple case into an action of trover-dis. graceful to the House of Commons, he thought, but not very puzzling, he was sur, to the people of this country. There was a L)arty called the peace party, and he solemnty believed in his heart that that part-y did more to bring on and continue the war with Russia thani aniy set or boDy Of mnen in this country. He had had the opportunity, through a friend, at the time the war with the Emperorof Russia was waging, and while discussions upon the subject were going on in the House of Commons, of seeing the speeches of two distinguished members of that pat tranislated into Russian. Those speec'heswere deliveredny Mr. Gladstone andbya man far before him, because he had rendered great service to his country at a time when the causeof free trade had to boebattled for; and muchi did he (M1r. Osborne) lament that Mr. Cobden had taken this crotchet into his head. Hle knew from certain aucthority that so great an effect was produced on the mind of -Nesselredo by those speeches that the Czar Nicholas presumed that we -shouldl never go to wvar, or, having gone to war, we should be glad to make peace on any terms. This more immediately conductedl him to the consideration of what had caused this awful dissolution of Parliament. Now, what were the circumstance of this Chinlese dLssolution? Did any maan there imagine that it was on account of -what bad been justly termed the miserable affair of the Arrow? No. it wras not the Arrow of the Canton waters, but the archers sitthing on the Ministerial side of the House below the gansy, who aimed their arrows at the Ministerial butt, oping to hit the bull's-eye of office, that had caused the dissolution. (" Hear," and alaugh.) The hon. gentlemian here went with somne minuteness into, the consideration of the China qulestion. Once let foreign nations, and especially the Chines, see we were ready to disown our admirals and governors who were onl the pt and who were therefore better able to judge of the emegen'cy of the casqe than we in this country (hear)-
le.te se that, and England would sink to a third-rate Power, while she would never find anny mnan of character willing or able to serve her abroad. (Cheers.) A great run had been made at Sir John Bowring, and if any man ever had occasion to utter the exclamaation, " Save mne from my friends!1" it was the Governor of Hongl-ong. Hle trusted that they, the people, who niever deserted a man so long as he remainied true and honest, would not be led away by this outcry against Sir John Powring. He knew him to be innocent. Ile might be nmistak-en in seine of his views, but he know him to be a conscientious man, and, so far from being inimical to China, the complaintLs of the merchants at Hongkong had been that he had been a great deal too kind towards the Chinese, and too much disposedl to cultivate his originalviews(for ho had been, secretary to the Peace Society) in carrying on transactions with that perfidious nation. So far was he from having been a favourite with English m erchants that they manifested a directly opposite sentiment. Henoweametothe domesticpoilcyof this country. He had alas 'before a well-k-nown society was organized, had asrn notion of the necessity ?of what was called AdU i.nitratiYges Reform (cheers), and he know that Her Majesty's present Government long before that cry became the fashion and the hobby of the day,-for these things were taken up as much throuagh fashion as were the dreses of the ladies,-had taken steps in furtherance of such, a reform. Lord Palmerston first originated administrative reform at the War-office (hear, hear) when he originated there the principle of selection for merit, and took men, not according to the connexions, which he (Mr. Osborne) had before alluded to, but for their working and esential requisites for the offices they wore to fill. In an humble way he had endeavoured to imitato that e=ml. Holding the position he did as Secretary for the Adiaty, he found that patronage was not, only irksome to refuse, but that the whole system was so unfair and so disagreeable to the giver while, if it was not disaireeable to the recipient, it must have caused
hinay uilng but satisfaction, that he prevailed upon the Board of Admiralty to allow him to divest himdself of that patronage ; and he challenged anyone to say that he had given him mere patronage. Re claimed, therefore, to be somethinig of an Administrative Reformer, for he had caused that patronage to be vested in tho Imperinteadents of dockyarcds, who, being naval men, had no prejdice
(Oh!) or ought not to have. (` Hear," an-d a .laug-h.) {nere were other minor questions which he had had the honour of assisting to carry what he believed was a satisfactory solution. Rethought it was right for them to recollect that Lord Palmaerston was, or had been, the member of a Government which had agreed upon a Reform Bill, which, in consequence of that war WhIc was provoked and carried on mainly through the instrumentality and
speches of the Peace party, Lord John Russell was obliged to abandon with tears in his eyes. They asked him, then, what ho was going to do about Reform, and he replied that he would take whiat he could get. Hoemig ht ha-ve ideas which his friends in the Misistry probably thought were too fast, and which he himself thought would not probably be carried out in his time. He was not one of those people who had ever possessed any very exaggerated notions on the ballot; he had never thought it a panacea for all the evils which beset electors; but his reason for supporting it had been this-the constituencies themselves are the beat judges. (He-ar.) He had, he was sorry to say, had opportunity of seeing great intimidation and disgusting bribery. He was rather inclined to think- the ballot would not do all that was -wished, yet he regarded it as the right thing, as the elec-tor could not be worse off than he was at present. (Hear, hear.) "How will you vote on Maynooth ?" he had heard some three or four gentlemen say. He answered plainy that he would ho no party to taing rom Isdrsh iellow-subjects that miserable 30, 0001. a-year which was voted thoem. (Cheers.) He had no love for the political system of the Roman Catholic Church, but he had a great love for justice. He could not see-as he often did when he went to his parish church, which was a church crying in the wildernes (for the congregation consisted of some 60 people)- next to that church, and before a priest of the Roman Catholic religion, in a chapel dilapidated and the people kneeling in mud and puddle, a congregation of 800, without feeling something of the injustice we should be committingaby taking from themen. of that persuasion the miserable 30, a. -year votedfor May. nooth. Af ter expressing his opinion in favour of the abolition ofechurch-rates,he said,-When SirToshua Walmisley moved his resolution that the Crystal Palace should be opened on Sunday he opposed it, because he had no wish to see this country resemble in its Sunday observances our friends across the water. We were a different people and of different habits. He didi not meana to nibble at our neighbours; they had been brought up differently, and had imbibed a different set of principles on these subjects. (Hear.) He was a supporter - mn]~in jnsnbecausehe hn~ cn- na man, w- ndsre yhi olaus n
while the storm of war was raging and the event of the contest seemed doubtful, remain tM his post. In the words of Lord J. Russell, he (Mr. Osborne) said that Lord Palmerston was nat the Maiister of Austria, stil less was he the Minister of Chinad; and, if Lord Palmerston remained at te helra, sure he was that our foreign policy would be upheld with glory, and that the domestic policY of this country would be adminitred to the satisfactin and hpiedpassm ofr thempeople.

(Laughter.) He found that the HArbour Commissoners were very much in debt, and that makny gentlemen were in a great friht in the anticipat ion of power they had enjoyed passing from them. It was not improbable he should have somnething to say to this. If ho did he would tako care of one thlng,-hawonld see justice done, andl would take care
that if Dover did not rise to be a more considerable port tha she was at present, it should not be forwantof his exertion. But, above all, ho promiisedl them, if he had anythingr to do with it, the dlebts should be discharged, and the accounts kept in a manner more creditable than it appeared theyhadbees. (Loud= ceerin
At the conclusion of Mr. Osbrne's ad(lressthe CHAnRac.s? took the sense of the meeting as to whether, after this exposition of his opinions, Mr. Osborne should stillbo asked to stand as a candidate for the suifrages of the Liberal electors? A forest of hands appeared in answer to this appeal, and the Chairman declared the decision of the meting infavour of Mr. Osborne to be unanimous. eme
Sir W. Russzi, then camne forward. He wasg prepared to go with M1r. Osborne, who had lust given them a clear and brilliant statement of his political views and prin. ciples. In almost every pointt adfixeted tW by Mr. Osborne
be (Sir W. Russell) agreed with him (cheers), and he should be happy in attempting to ride second-horse to him. (" eHr," and a laugh.)
Mr. B. OSBORNE then moved a vote of thanks to thc Chairmain, which was seconded by Sir W. RUSSELL.
The CuLaRta:.tr- briefly responded, and after a few words from the Rer. T. B. W. BRJGGS the meeting was brought to a conclusion.
NORWICH.
On Thursday evening a large public meeting was held a' Norwich, to hear a furthor oxposition of their oninions fj cm Viscoult Bury and 31r. H. W. Schneider, the Liberal candidates. Mr. J. H. Tillett presided.
Viscount Bup.y, in addressing the meeting, avowed bi:nself a supporter of Lord Palmerstan. The question no at issue was, not the legality of the Chinese wAr, but wheth r the count,} was to have a Derbyite or a Liberal Ministry. The first vote in the new lHouse of Commons would, probably, be one of confidence in Lord Palmerston. If he was returned he should sipport Lord Palmerston in that ! vote, but wlhen it was over he should be unpledged, and
should only follow Lord Palnierston when lhe led the way vith tboroughly hberal measures. The noble lord then rtated that he was in favour of a 5'. franchise for towns, and a 101. franchise for counties. (Cheers.) He was in favour of the ballot, and would vote for it, and for the abolition of church-rates, He did not approve, moreover, of any one church being taxed by another. He was in favour of a national poor-rate for the aged and infirm poor, and a poor-rate spread over a uuioa of counties for the support of the able-bodied poor. (Cheers) A system of emigration would be a verv good aid to lhe poor-rate, as it would enable the able-bodied poor, instead of comir g on the rates, to proceed, if they chose, to Canada, or some of our other colonies. HRe was a freetrader i the fulest sense of the term, and he thought aU duties ought to be taken entirely away from articles which entered largely into the consumption of the poorer classes.
le was in fvour of a sstem of national State education, but he thought the Bible ouht to be taken as the standard, and that no sectarian teaching should he allowed; all religious instructon onght to be given in the Sunday schoo's of the vaous denominations
Ir. SCSeEEIDxR expressed similar opinions, and read a letter from the chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, to the effect that every servant employed on the various lines in the district was to have an opportunity of recording his vote according to his conscience, and without any attempt at coercion on the part of anyone. (Cheers.)
An ELECTOB asked what course the candidates woald pursue with regard to the Maynooth endowment ?
Mr. SCHL\EDER, on the part of Lord Bury and himself, said they vwere opposed to all religions endowmests, and if ever a bil was brouglit forwvard in the House of Commons to do away with all religions endowents they vwould vote for it; but they would not vote for anything which bore the semblance of persecution to a particular sect, and they would do nothing which would tend to create a lust feeling of dissatisfaction among a large class of their fellow citizens. They wore not in Parliament when the Maynooth grant was first given, but they found it in existence, and therefore it was in a very different position to that which it would bave occupied if it had been brought forward in the ensuiug session, in which latter case they should have voted against it. (Cheers.)
MIr. PALMERE, Recorder of Great Yarmouth, next addressed the meeting, and stated that a fewv years ago a p assenger in a merchant vessel, commanded by his son, hid witnessed the execution of 300 Chinese at once by Commlissioner Yeh's orders, an executioner being appointed to every 10 victims. The peaceful embassies Of Lord Macartasy and Lord Amherst had been attended with no results; and he (Mr. Palmer) beheved that the only way to make the British flag respected in China wa. to carry matters with a high hand. (Cheers.)
The proceedings closed with three hearty cheera for Lord Bury and Mr. Schneider.
LEEDS.
The state of the Liberal party continues unsatisfactory, and though the committee appointed to find a candidate have succeeded in selecting a gentleman to bring before the constituency, the existing division renders his return by no nieans sure. The Fentleman selected by the committee is Mr. Remington Mills, of London, a well known and earnest " voluntaTy educationist." A private meeting of the general committee and other electors was held yesterday afternoon, but tho result was not known when our parcel was despatched, though it is probable Mr. Mills will be immediately brought before the electors. Mr. Hall, the Conservative candidate, addressed a numerous meeting of his friends on Thursday night, and was well received. During his speech he said:-" Lord Palmerston is for the moment to be judged particularly by one measure-the Chinese war, and I am iii favour of the most vigorous prosecution of that war. (Cheers.) I have been asked, ' what would I have done if I had been a member of Parliament on the division a fortnight ago. During the time I have been at York I have received much valuable information from an excellent friend of mine, who was for many years Her Majesty's Vice-Consul at Ntingpo, and he gives me such a view of the way the Chinese go on, of their attempts to shut out the commerce of the WesternL nations, as to present the conduct of Lord Palmerston's Governmenlt an a much more favourable light than it was before. I will support Lord Palmerston in the vigorous prosecution of that war (cheers), and I will not give a single vote which will cripple or paralyze his action in that war. (Cheers.) WiVth respect to Lord ralmerston's general policy I mnst bo more cautious. As I have said in my address, my maxim is measures, ntot men. (Hear, hear.)Take Lord Palmerston himself-and he is not worse than the other public men of the age ; he is only like all of them-take, I say, Lord Palmerston himself with the 20 years of Sidmouth and Castlereagh Toryism of his youth, the 20 years' Liberalism of his middle life, and the strong, unmistakeable indications which for tho lasb few years lie has been exhibiting, that his opinions and affections are returning to those of his youth (laughter); taking these things, and remembering the strong opinions expressed by many friends of mine, that Lord Palnerston will in a little while be the best Conservative in the House of Commons, I am driven back to that maxim of minemeasures, not men." (Laughter and cheers.) As to elecI toral reform, he said he was opposed to any I transfer of the basis of the suffrage, but would supI port an extension of the franchis to persons having
501. in building societies or savings-banks, and to copyholders. He should oppose a 51. franchise, but would support a measure for giving all 101. householders a right to vote in some borough. He was opposed to the ballot. I or to the compulsory abolition of church-rates, but should be
glad to see the latter cluestion settled by mettual concession. As to education, he was opposed to any education by Act of Parliament, but w;as in favour of the present system of grants, which he believed to be the best. He would not abolish the lilynooth Grant, thongh opposed to it, unless the Church of Pome made further aggressions, He wras in favour of the abolition of tow n dues. The meeting pledged itself to support him at the ensulng election.
PORTSMOUTH.
(BY ELIScmC TELEGRAPL.)
A neow candidate came into the field to solicit the suffrages of the electors of this borough to-day-Sir James Dalrymp!e Blphinstone, Chairman of the Great Northern Railway of Scotland, who addressed a very large meeting of influential electors at the George Hotel this evening, Alderman Orange in the chair. Sir James said, he was au advocate for free trade. in favour of administrative reform, extension of the frnchise, and coincided with Lord Palmerston's policy on the China question. He was opposed to centralization, the 'New Beer Bill, kc. After the candidate had addressed the meeting the following resolution, moved byTown-CounciUor DA,VEY, and seconded by Alderman GAUNTLETT, was put and carried by acclamation:-
*- That this meeting, having heard the sentimente of Sir James Dalrynple Eluhinustone, and being desirous ot returning a member to Par. liament who wi Identify himself with the interests of this borough, do pleIge itself to use every exertion to cure hls electiou."
TOWER HAMETS.
It has been determined by a large number of influential electors to bring forward Mr. Acton Ayrton as a candidate for the suffrages of the electors. Last eveniug there was a prelhminary meeting held at the Safe Harbour Tavern, Arbour-square, Stepney, and the large room was fiUed with MIr. Ayrton's friends. Mr. H. Preece, a member of the new vestry of Mile-end, Old Town, was in the chair, and near him we observed Mr. G. Walton, shipowner, chairman of the hamlet of RIateliff Parochial Reform Association, Mr. W. Newton, Mr. Tettmar, Mr. Stevens, and other electors. A committee was formed to take the necessary steps to secure the election of Mr. Ayrton, who it was stated had expressed his readiness to respond to the call made upon him and to contest the borougn.
FINSB1JRY.
Last evening an extremely crowded and higblyinfluential meeting of the electors of this borough was held at the British Institution, Cowper-street, City-road, for the purpose of hearing from Mr. T. S. Duncombe, ILP., the first statement of his political principles since the appeal to the country.
Mr. G. S. BEArE occupied the chair, and, having opened the proceedings with a few brief observations, called on
Mr. T. S. DuNcoaIIBE, I.P., who in addressing the meet-
ing denounced tho opposition to the Government as a faction, and said, that under all circumstances, he felt that a proper course had been taken to prevent a repetition of the insult to the British flag. He had no doubt that the measures which had been adopted were right, and for that reason he had stood by Lord Palmerston and his Government. It was an insult to John Bull to pulL his nose, and, therefore, some reparation should have been made, but although that offer was made to Commissioner Yeh-the biggest naiscreant that ever lived-A man who beheaded 70,000 men ,who aked for reform-yet no apology was made. (Cheers.) That commissioner had ignominiously dragged out menL from their vessel and insulted the British flag; yet it was said that the knocking down of his house (laughter) was a shame, and that Sir John Bowring had been too strict. He thought it served Yeh right, and that is why he had stood by the Government, (Cheer& ) He contended that if the parties who had brought about thel adverse decision had beein in office they weuad have conducted the affair in the same spirit (hear), but the motion was fortunately brought forwArd by those who had previously supported L4ord Palmerston, and who had long been wishing for something to get him and his M1inisters out of -office. (Cheers.) It was said that Lord Pulmerston was no Reformer, and e would not ssy he was perhaps the beat, but he would ask whether SirTamesGrahanxorMsr.Gladstone were Reformers? ("No, no I"and cheers,) newouldtrpathom this, that if they put a lttle presre on orcd Palmerstoi they would find he would not be a bad Reformer. (Hear.) HIi3 first vote in conjunction with Lord Palmerston was on the Catholic Emancipation Bill, and lie was right, for the Catholics were entitled to their emancipation. (Cheers.) It had been said Lord Palnerston had done niothing to assist in carrying the great Reform Bil, but -ho (Mr. Duncombe) thoghtpeole ereto alt t lok a me'sfaulta without givig tem redt fr te gdd heybaddone. (He&r. hea.)He he aludd t te mnnr I 'hich Lord
better than continuing a most expensive and disastrous war (cbeers), and proceeded to defend the noble lord's conduct in that affair. He then referred to the question of churchrates, and said he should alivays continne to give his utmost support to any measure for their total and entire abolition. (Cheers.) He was in favour of the vote by ballot, because he felt that many nmen of intelleot were net represented who would be if they had the ballotand, t erefore, he considered it was a necessary thing, and he should always support it. (Cheers.) With regard to
his conduct in Parliament he defended the different votes he I had given. He said he should never be a blind adherent to any Minister, but if he felt that a hinister brought forward measures for the good of the country he should support him. In conclusion, he trusted his acts and votes
ad been satisfactory, and that his friends would support him on the polling day. He felt confi ent of success, but as there were five candidates, all professing Liberal opinions, and he never knew success arise from being over-confident, he trusted his friends would come forward early on the polling day and give him their support. He was ready to answer any questions on points he might not be fully understood upon, and as he felt he had done his duty he left it to the electors of Finsbury to do theirs, (Loud applauso.)
In answer to Mr. HOBURNi,
blr. DuNcomrnx said he did not deny when Lord Palmerston last came into power be was the faded gem of bygoneAdmninistrations,for hislordshiphad beenconnected with one or theotherAdministration ever sincehe (Mr. Duncombe) had sat in the House; but if he found him looking brighter and better to-morrow he shou'd congratulate him on it. (Laughter and cheers.) He thought they ought to be thankful to Lord Palnerston for having got rid of Whiggery (bear, hear), for he thought that higgisni was the most paltry thing that ever existed. (Laughter.) With regard to the Charter, he did not think they would ever get it from Lord Palmerston. As to his attendance, he never mixed himself up with railway matters and such things, but no one could deny he had been punctual in attendance when such questions as the subject of Finsburypark and others that affected the interest of his constituents were under discussion. He thought that those whose names had the greatest number of votes recorded against them gave the least amount of attendance, for they generally came into the House when a large number of votes were given on questions that had occupied no time in discussion.
Mr. SNELL wished to know if Mr. Duncombe had formed any coaltion with Mr. Cox?
Mr. DuNCOmnmE disclaimed auything of the sort. (Cheers.) Mr. KEAST then said, he had no doubt whatever but that they all agreed with him that the statement and explanations of their hon. member 'were perfectly honest and straightforward, and he caUed on the meeting to carry the following resolution:-
" That this meeting grtefully recognises the honest and cansistent pubUc career of T. S. Duncombe, Esq., more especialy daring the 23 years he hsa represented the borough of Flnsbury in Parliament, and, feeliuz the most unbounded confidence in bis continued stesdfastneu to the great cause of Parliamentary Reform and civil and raugions liberty, pl edges itself to use the utninot exer tions in the ensuing election to place him at the head of the poU free Of expese8."
(Loud cheers.)
MIr. W. BAILY having briefly seconded the motion,
Mr. WATsoN, in support, expressed himself a Chartist, but he would be content with what he could get. He hoped theywouldnot let the greatoccasionof this election be passed over on the cry of "I Palmerston for ever !" but he wished they would rivet their attention on these four points among others,-the extension of the suffrage, the shortening of Parhaments, the vote by ballot, and something like an equality of electoral districts. With regard to t e last, he thought it was required, because the votes of the members for such a constituency as Finsbury, numbering 21000, were neutralized by those of the representatives of the small boroughs with 200 or 300 electors.
After a few remarks from Mr. SALVAGE and Mr. HOWARD, the motion was put and carried amidst the most enthusiastic applause, without a single dissentient.
Three cheers were given for Mr. Duncombe, and the proceedings, which were most harmonious throughout, then terminated, Mr. Duncombe having previously thanked the electors in a few brief sentences for their expression of confidence in him.
There seems to be not the slightest doubt of Mr. Duncombe's re-election.
Last evening Mlr. Serjeant PARRY addressed a numerous body of the electors of this borough at the London Mechanics' Institution, Southampton-buildings, Chancerylane, Mr. Southey in the chair. The learned gentleman repeated his opinion upon the great questions of political, social, and religious progress. fie announced himself as a zealous Reformer, and friendly to the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. Hils replies were satisfactory to all the questions put to him, and, at the termination of his address, which lasted about an hour, the following resolution, moved by Mr. LLOYD, of Gray's-inn-lane, and seconded by Mr. BABB, of High Holborn, was carried by a triumphant majority :
- That this metiDg, bavIng heard from 31r. serieant Parry a statement of bis sentiments on the great poUtical questions of the day, aud having a regard to hia long-tried and consistent puhlic career, believe him to be a,lit and proper person to occupy the vacancy in the repro sentation of this borongh in the ersuing Parliament, and pledges itself to use every exertion to secure his return:'
LAMBETH.
Last night a most numerous meeting of the supporters of Mr. Wilkinson was held in the Grove-hall, Camberwell, to hear an explanation of his votes during the last session of Parliament, Mr. Robert Alexander Gray was caled to the chair.
Mr. WILEINSON, on prenenting himself, was received with loud and enthusiastIc cheering. Ue declared himself to be a supporter of Lord PaImerston's Govermnent, and vindicated his vote on the late war in Canton. He declared that he had been most unvarying in his attendance in the House of Commons. In alusion to the question of opening exhibitions, &c., on Sunday afternoons, he said that although he was in the abstract in favour of giving the people every rational amusement yet, considering the division of opinions which prevailed upon the subject, until a great change of public mind took place upon it, he was not prepared to support Sir Joshua Walmsley's motion, and would oppose any similar motion that might be brought forward by others.
In answer to questions from different electors Mr. WILsiNsoN declared himself to be in favour of civil and religious liberty; of a rate being levied for the po so of giving secular instruction to the children of te people - but he was opposed to a rate for religious education, as fie thought that was a matter that might be safely left to the parents of those children themselves. He vas not prepared to offer any opinion as to the legality or illegality of preaching in the parks, or whether he could support Sir Benjamin Hail in excluding preachers fromthe perks.
Several other questions were put, to which Mr. Wilkdnson gave answers which were deemed to be highly satisfactory.
Mr. W. WELLS then came forward and said that, having vatched the political conduct of Mr. Wilkinson during the time he had been their member, he had no hesitation vhatever in coming to the conclusion that he was a thoroughly honest man, and he should give him hissupport. He concluded by moving-
"That the meeting, having heard the sentiments of llr. WJlkianon, and knowing that he has attended to his Parliamentary duties with unfailing assiduity, considers him to be a mit and proer person to reresnt the boroughofIambeth in Parliament, and pledges itself to use every exertion to secure his return."
Mr. EAsRLIN seconded the motion.
Mr. JosiN GREEh supported the resolution, and said they had a truly honest member, and he sincerely hoped that the borough would do themselves honour by agaiu returnmig Mr. Wilkinson at the head of the polL
Mr. WnssoN (who was received with great disapproba. tijr'i)moved an amendment, condemning the conduct of Mr. Wilkinson, and particularly in respect to the vote he had given against Mr. Roebuck's motion for inquiry into the treatment of the army in the Crimea.
Mr. WILKs-isoN.-I did nothing of the kind. 1 voted for :3r. Roebuck's motion. (Tremendous cheering, in the midst of which Mdr. Wesson sat down.)
Mr. CULVERWELL secondedt he amendment, and strongly censured the conduct of Mr. Wilkinson, amid the greatest in'patience and disapprobation.
The CHAIRI3AN then put the question, when the amendnrut was supported by about 20 persons, and the original motion was carred by an immense majority, with great
Than's were then voted to the cbairman, and the meeting broke up at 20 minutes past 10 o'clock.
IrVERPOOL.
Mr. Ewart, the Liberal candidate, has been extremely active duoing the past several nights, addressng ward meetings in-various parts of the town. At a meeting of the electors of St. Anne's ward on Thursday night, he stated that, if returned, he would not go pledged to the House of Commons, though his services should be given to promote the interests of his constituents. He 'was notin favour of rash changes in our constitution, to the danger of its liberties, but for onward progress towards a steady and satisfactory constitutional reform. (Cheers.) If they electedhim again as their representative, and if Lord Palmerston occupied his present high position, and if he continued to carry on the government in the manner he had lately done, he (Mr. Ew3rt) would give him his cordial, sincere, and hearty sup. port. (Cheers.)
At a meeting the same night of the electors of West Derby ward, Mr. J. C. Bwart, referring to the Crimean Commissioners, said:-" I did feel, and a great many people in this country felt, that those commissioners were most cruelly treated wheon they returned home, simply because they had made a fair and honest report. (" Hear," and applause.) Some of my friends in Liverpool took up that question, and they repared an address to Sir John M'Neill and Colond Tuloch. It was signed by men of every party in Iiverpool. I had the honour of presentag that address to those gentlemen, and I am deli"hted to say that the part which Liverpooltook in that m7atter roused the indignation and the feeln of nearly the whole -of the country. (Applause.) Gentlemen, earl in the session I took almost the DTSt opportunity of asking the Prime Minister of this country whether he intended to recommend the Queen to confer any mark of dignity upon those gentle. men. I did not receive a perfectly satisfactory answer froni him, hut I did obtain at lant from the Government of this country an acknowledgment that the services of those gentlemen were freely and properly acknowledged by that -Government. (Hear, hear.) I mean properly acknowledged, to far as an admission that tbey did their duty fearlessly and honestly to the Government and to the people of this country. ("Bravo," and applause.) Gentle. men, it was a question which did require, I must say, some little tact to naneo, but, after some further delay, I again 3pressed that quetion upon some members of the Govern3ment, and I did receive an asurance that Colonel Tulloch and Sir Jobn M'Neill would receive some inmask of
distnctioa from Her Majesty, as a recompense-as i some recompense, at least-for the valuable services they had rendered to this country. (Hear, hear.) I was aware that a motion had been put upon the bocirsof the house by a gentleman-the member for North Devonrelative to these Crimean Commissioners. That notice was not quite so satisfactory as I could wish, and therefore I sdded to 'bat notice one that the House should move an addrebs to the Queeni to confer some proper mark of dis.
tinction upon Sir J. Mi'Neilland Colonel Tulloch. (Hear.) I considered the services they had rendered had been most inadtquately rewarded, and I was determined, at any risk a1l11st, to press that motion to a division. When the time arrived I asked Lord Palmerston whether it was his intention to confer any distinction on them. I knew Lord Palrnerston was exceedingly anxious it should be done (hear, b, ar). but, for some reasons to which it is not necessary to allude, somo pressure (laughter) was put on from a quarter whilnh it was impossible to resist, and I could not get a satisfactory answer from the noble lord. (Hear, bear.) I told biu, I was detertnined to press it, and did press it, and I am happy to Pay that the motion was carried without a divisioa by the unanimous voice of the House. (" Bravo " and applause.) A few days after, as perhaps some of you have seer, tdie Quxeen acknowledged the receipt of a communicatior, from tne House of Commons, and told her Commons that s%h wvould take care it should be carried into effect. N 6w, Gentlemen, so ends this eventful history.
A 'splIt;" is reported in the Tory ranks in Liverpool
which illay possibly jeopardize the seat of Mr. Horsfall. It is sait that the ultra members of the party look upon the hb-n. gei,tlenian as too liberal in the views he expounded at the late meeting at the Amphitheatre, and that they int nid to " plump" for Turner. If this alleged breach becomes tlii-r ugh and distinct, there can be no doubt that the Liberal v-.t. r, - Xill support Mr. Horsfall, that the liberal Conservativ, - will split with hr. Ewart,and that both those gentlemen n-i,, will be returned. Mr. Turner, in his position as bhals,, m.n of the Dock Committee, openly advocates the rece.gr.ition of the principle that the officials of that great eIstate, irclding the heads of departments, who, of course, hav some .little pickings of patronage to dispose, are at liher ty to canvass for which candidate they may be pleased to support.
ROCHDALE.
On Nvednesday evening one of the largest public meetings ever hold in the Public hall assembled for the purpose of hearii,g an address from MIr. Mhll, hI.P., to the electors of this bor%ugh. The hall was filled in every corner, the great
body of the people standing. The platform was also cranin.ed full of the principal manufacturers of the neighbourliood. Prior to the cormnencement of the meeting a largeilininber of the electorsmet Mr. Miall in the lower room of the Piblic-hall, and he there delivered a short address. Onj his entering the hall he was received with repeated and prolonged plaudits.
'I'bhe MAYot moved that Mr. G. AsnwosTic should take the clhair.
Alderman STEWVART seconded the motion, which was carried by acclamation.
Mr. MIALL, who -was received witl prolonged cheering, addressed the meeting at some length, pointing out with such hlmour that the constituents were to have another fight with the same unchangeable Toryisun which they had known for so many years. He then went oln to say,-Gentlemen, I understand we are to have the catechism, and I for one am willing to go tbrough the catechism. If you ask, What do you think of the balot? I think I should say, I think now of the ballot as 1 have always done since I thought on the subject at alL. If you were to ask whether I thought the ballot would promote hypocrisy, I should ask whether the present system bits not promoted hypocrisy. If you were to object to the ballot on the ground that it was hypocrisy,-excuse sue, but I do believe you would be playing the hypocrite at that moment. But I believe I have a good reason why I ought to oppose the ballot, because I am told that if the ballot were in force in this borough I should not bethe chosen of the electoral body. (Hear, hear.) Now, gentlemen, mark if that be the true explanation. If the hon. baronet who uttered this really was sincere in utterin,g it, as I have no doubt he was, what an ad. vocate of the ballot he ought to be! (Applause.) He wants todeliveryoufrom the disggraceof being misrepresented. Be thinks that if you had the balot you would soon get lid of me as your representative, and he says, moreover, that he thinks that it would greatly promote hypocrisy. That is the reason why he opposes it. Now, look; the ballot would proniotehypocrisy; but, in sendinghim, it would get rid of me. (Applause.) I cannot read it any other way; but 1 choose to draw the other inference, as I have a right to draw it, and I say that, while Rochdale isno hyocrite, there is no getting rid of me. Well, but there isthe other question with regard to the reform of our representative system. I will not trouble you this evening by arguing these points, because you are all weU acquainted with them. Yoa have not discussed them altogether in vain. You cannot feel content to see a small borough with 170 voters sending to the House of Commons the same number of representatives as the West Riding of Yorkshire, with nearly its 40,000 electors. sfter dwelling upon the present inequality of the electoral distribution, the hon. member continued :-I am not op. nosed to any Government as such. I will support any Government in carryingA right measures, and I will oppose any Government that fLthink is endeavouring to palm measuwes upon us injurions and delusive. I am not a Palmerston maai, nor a Lord John Russell man, a Disraeli or a Derbyite man. ("You are a John Bright man." Loud apapplause.) My motto has been-Measures, not men; principies above party; and I intend to stand by those, whatever may be the consequences to myself. When you are tired of rme, I can retire into privacy with satisfaction, carrying with me the proud recollection that the people of Rochdale once trusted me, and continued their trust in me for a perId of five years. If you prefer to be represented by nmen who wil stoop to Government, who will vote as they are bid, who are condoned with and anon can shout victoriously in support of this party or of that, believing al
their professions, yours is the right to decide. My only regret in that case wiU be, not for myself, but for you; for, having been once engaged to yon, I feel that your honour is mine. After condemning in the strongest terms the conduct of Sir J. Bowring and the Government, conduct which he contended was so far from maintaining the honour of the British flag that it, in fact disgraced it. Mr. Mall said the dispute really resolved itself lnto thisIs your own House of Commons nominally the representatives of the people and the only representatives de facto, altbough not the real representatives dejuere Are we to be fully ignored in reference to all foreign politicsa Are we to express an opinion when au opinion is invited? or are we to nseet merely to confirm the Government of the day ? ("No.") Are your representatives of the Government in foreign arts to enter into war without lettin
the people ow or asking their opinion about it' ("No.") Besides defending the lives and liberties of Her Majesty's subjects-which they are bound to do-but besides that are they to enter into a coalition-an armed coalition-merely for enforcing the pet policy of those men, and that even against their express opinions and the necessities of the State. Which are we stand by? The rights of the people or our diplomatists? (Hear, hear.) Are we to say they arenot to be blamed? ("No.") Well, gentlemen, I took the liberty side of the question. (Hisses.) Aye, hiss the sentiment, if you will, but I did it. I gave my vote as a Radical. (Loud applause.) I stood by the right of the House of Commons, against the assumption of the Ministry of the day. (Hear hear.) In my person, and so far as I am concerned, the privileges of that House sball not be trampled under foot by any Minister, call him what you wil. (Loud applause.) I say that we who have the purses of the people at our command, aud tax them, that it is not right that we should allow them to be taxed without being consulted. (Hear.) You wvill have to pay for these wars. I cannot call it war, this bombardment of Canton. You willhave to pay for them in increased taxes; andwhat would youhave said if wehadconsented to increased taxes to be laid on you, and at the same time had never thought it worthwhile to inquire whether we should have been doing good or harm? I voted "No"I mean " No" against the Government-and I voted so as a Liberal in favour of continental freedom over the whole of Europe. Why, you had a great mnan among you lately. (Hear.) I know not what he said to you, because
I know not the special topics on which he addressed you, but I can undertake to say that he warned you against secret diplomacy. Why, this war has come out of it. I the House of Commons had a fair supervision of foreign affairs, this sad business could not have been brought about; but the fact is we have wars begun, continued, completed, and treaties entered into, without so much as being consulted on the matter. Well, gentlemen, I say it is time to assert our rights. (Hear, hear.) We are not the peopleespeciaUy the people of Rochdale-who ought to permit such proceedings on the part of a Prime Minister whose policy abroad we don't understand. (Hear, hear.) I believe you would have rightly turned me out of my place if I had been so wanting in my duty as to vote to keep men to give liberty to every aristocrat sent to represent you abroad to make war without so much as asking the people their consent. This is the question on which Lord Palimerston nmakes his appeal to you and to the electors of the country at large. He says, " Will you back me against the House of Commons, and this point, that I shall make war?" Willyousustain him? ("No, no.") Are you goingto sustain him on that point? ("Yes," "No no," " Turnhim out.") Gentlemen, you need not turn him out; he will be taxed to his heart's content. Now, if Lord Palmerston had chosen to behave with what I should call common discretion in this matter, there need not have been an adverse vote at all.
HlUDDERSFIELD.
On Thursday night Mr. Cobden addressed a numerous meeting of the inhabitants at the theatre. Mr. C. H. Jones presided.
.Mr. COBnDEN raiterated the reasons which had induced him to 'withdraw from the representation of the West Rliding of Yorkshire, and then referred at great length to the affairs of China. He said he brought on his motion in the House of Commons without consultation of any kind with any human being except Mr. Milner Gibson,'whom he asked to second it. The hon. gentleman afteralludingminutely toall thecircumstancesounected with the affair of the lorcha Arrow, assured the meeting that the motion he made had had the support of every man of intellect and who felt a responsibility as the leader of a party in the House, not in the Government. He included their late noble representative Lord Goderich, Lord John Russell, Sir Francis Baring, and every man in the House who was not in the Government, but who had been in office,-these had all voted with him, with the excoption of Mr. Ellice, the hon. memberfor Coventry, who had in his address condemned his own vote, for he pleaded in favour of his (Kr. Cobden's) motion. Mr. Cobden proceeded to state the grounds on which he solicited the suffrages of the electors of Huddersfield. Ho thougbt that our old Saxon principle was a greet one-he meant the ancient household suffrage, the old Saxon principle of household suffrage, when the head of every family wbo had a stake in the country was entitled to a voice and reipponsibihty of a freeman. He did not see, in the present day, why we should be afraid to resort to the came mode of self-government. He was willing, him. self, to try his chance upon that. At present there was a great inequality in the distribution of electoral power. Little towns, with only 400 electors, bad the power of returning two members, while Huddersfield, with 1,500 or snore electors, could only return one. The subject required redress just as mnuch as that the suffrage oughtto be extended,
There was another question connected with the franchise whichurequired just asmuch attention-he meantthe mode of takilg votesat elections. Now, hehadnodoubtintheworld, if he were to addressthemthreeweeks hencethere would be a sbout of recognition of the sentiments he was gding to express, because wben he talked to themn of the ballot immediately after a general election, when every man's sores
were green; when the screw had been turned down upon every man in some way or other; when shopkeepers were confused between two rival customers; wvhen millhands and
overlookers were infutenced by their employersm then, with the sense of these wrongs and injuries fresh in their memories, there was always a hearty response to the question of the ballot. Now, he would say it was almost an evil to give men votes unless they also gave them protection.
At this period of Mr. Cobden's address an accident took place of which a brief notice, received by electric telegraph, appeared in The Times of yesterday. There was a tremendous crash caused by the falling of a portion of one of the side galleries on the right of the speaker. About 20 persons were precipitated, along with beams, &c., on the heads of those who were underneath. Indescribable confasion ensued, and, a rush being made towards the smaU outlets and to the stage, resat fear was felt that many persons would be trampled under foot. Several attempts were made by the gentlemen on the stage to induce the audience to remain quiet, but in vain, and the alarm increased in consequence of one or two men who had saved themselves from falling through the gaUery becoming se frghtened that they made one or two attempts to jump off. A ladder being fortunately near, a safe escape was made, and the men were cheered by the audience.
Mr. CoarsEN became much affected by the accident, and expressed his intention not to proceed longer with
The assembly then separated as quietly as they could under the circumstances.
On Thursday Mlr. Peel, lI P., addressed about 1,000 of the electors and non-electors of Bury, in a large wooden theatre near to the market-place. Shortly after 8 o'clock the Chairman of Mr. Peel's committee, Mr. IicbacdAshton, opened the proceedings with a few observations upon tho nature of the opposition to the return of Mr. Peel, and observed that Mr. Hickley, the Chairman of Mr. Philips's committee, had offered to withdraw that gentleman from the field if he (the chairman) would consent to withdraw MIr. Peel; a proposition which he declined to accede to. He then called upon Mr. Peel to address the audience.
3Mr. PEEL felt grateful to the friends who had exerted themselves to promote his interest and make him stand vell with the electors. The measures which had recently been brought forward were measures for ensuring the usual discipline of the army, and for voting money to enable the military service to be carried on durng the interval which was about to take place. They had only been concluded yesterday, and he had now come down at the earliest opportunity to defend his political principles and answer any question they might have to propose to him. He regretted to find there was a competition with him for their favour. He thanked Mr. Philips for the compliment he had paid to his gallant brotherin thenavy. (Three cheers for Captain Peel.T He had passed through memorable scenes, had distinguished himself before Sebastopol, and had been decorated with a distinction which he considered one of the highest that could be conferred by the Crown; it was for the achievement of some distinguished act of gallantry before the enemy-he referred to the Victoria Cross. It was his belief that if both Mtr. Philips and himself were members during the next P aliament there would be few questions indeed on which they should not both vote on the same side, except that he (Mr. Peel) should vote as being in the Government, and Mr. Philips as with the Government. It had been said he (MIr. Peel) had no conscience, that it was in the keeping of the head of the Government. There was no reason whatever why a popular representative should not enter the service of the Crown. He then took a review of the proceedings in Parliament for the last few years. The most prominent object was the prosecution of a just and honourable war, and the conclusion of a safe and satisfactory peace. With regard to the conduct of that war, after the change of the head of the Government the prospects of the British army had improved and everything was done for the honour of England which the most patriotic could require. The noble lord now at the head of the Government infused new vigour into it, excited the military ardour of the country, and raised the army from the reduced state in which he found it to a body or 60,000 men, capable of executing any work, however Herculean or gigantic it might be. After the war had closed Russia endeavoured by artifice to elude the treaty by evading the line of territory. What was the course pursued by England? She assumed a firm attitude, and sbowed she was not prepared to yield any one of the points which had been gained with so much labour; and the consequence was that our late enemy resigned his pretensions, and the war was settled in the way we all desired from the first that it should be. He then briefly referred to the measures of education brought forward by Lord John Russell and Sir J. Pakington. The real difficulty turned not upon tbe question of rating, but upon the system of instruction to be adopted. It had been said taxation and representation ought to go together; and so they ought. As popular education was extended, so ought popular power to grow. It was sure to grow in that manmer by an extension of the franchise. He was in favour of an extension of the franchise. [A Voice-" How about Locke King's motion '?'j If, in 1832, it was safe to carry the suffrage to the point to which it was carried, it must be safe in 1857 to carry it beyond that point. He knew since 1832 education had been greatly extended, a cheap literature had come to obtain a wide circulation, and the improved character of that cheap literature, of a na ture that might give it admission into the frst families, showed that the taste of the people was pure and elevated. Then there was the cheap press, the result of a measure of Government last year, which remitted the stamp duty on newspapers. The consequence was the establishment of a number of cheap newspapers, which would familiarize those not now having the franchise with public questions, and the manner in which the public good was to be established. They might ask him how he had carried these principles into practice? He would answer that, in 1854, he was a member of theGovernment which brought in a Reform Bill. With regard to Locke King's Bill, he had to say that by the Bill of 1854 it was proposed to confer the franchise upon every person in counties having a tenement of 101. value. He gave his approval and support of that bill, and be saw no reason whatever for altering his opinion. True it was in this session he recorded his vote against a proposition of a similar kind. He did so because he joined in the objections made by the Government to that particular measure at that particular time. (Hisses, cheers, and groans ) With regar to the quesUon of finance, the reduction of expenditure, and a revsed taxation, he admitted that the expenditure at the present time was large, because we were emerging from a state of war; the expenditure was large and debts increased during the war, but this increase would disappear in the course of a few years. With regard to the money appropriated to army services, the estimated cost in the year 1856 was no less than 35,000,0001. This would give an idea of the sincerity with which Government had apphed itself to the reduction of expenditure. When he told them they had been able to brig down the estimates this year from 35,000,0001. to 11,200,0001., that simple fact would carry more conviction to their minds than any general profession he might make of a desire to reduce the expenditue He then adverted to the income-tax, and the reduced rate which had been adopted by Government. Presuming upon past kindness and partiality, he left the issue of the contest in their hands, iauguine that it would result in an expression of undiminished confidence in him. (Great cheering, mingled with somle hisses)
Three cheers were given for Mr. Peel, and an expression of confidence on the part of his friends closed the proceedings.

THE: AFF&Ans or CHniA. - A correspondence between the Foreign.office and the East Indiaand ChinaAssociation of Liverpool in 1846, 1847, and 184i, has just been printed by order of the House of Commons, on the motion of Viscount Hotham, M.P. It is interesting, as elucidating the viewe of Lord Palmerston on the policy to be pursued towards the Chinese when he held the seat of the Poreignoffice. The association, having in October, 1846, called the serious attention of his Lordship to the news just received from Canton (where the lives and property of the British residents were placed in the greatest jeopardy on the 8th of July, 1846), urged the absolute necessity of a British naval foroe being in future always stationed close to the Canton factories. In July, 1847, the association attacked thehostile proceedings at Canton of Sir John Davis, "which," it is observed, "must have appeared to the Chinese an unprovoked attaok in time of peace," and protested as British subjects against "the unjusLi&ble principle of a hostile aggression being made on a part of an empire far removed from the seat of Government, in violation of solemn treaties, without even the customaryforms 'which the laws of nations recognize and the feelings of humanity demand." The association express a regret that there had not been a more firm, consistent, and dignified policv pursued by Sir J. Davis towards the Chinese during the past three years, and "'which has now resulted in an act of aggression as rash and injudicious as the former policy had been weak and vacillating." Lord Palmerston (14th of July, 1847) replied to the association (through Mr. Addington), stating his difference from almoat all the opinions expressed on behalf of the szid asociation. His Lordship declines to express any opinion on the course pursued by Sir J. Davis for the last three year, although he thinks he may infer from his continuance in office that he (Sir John) had execated his instructions to the satisfaction of the existin" Goverument. With regard to his conduct durln' the last few months, Lord Palmerston meets tho accusations of the association with a direct negative, assrting that the measues " very promptly, very properly, and very successfully taken by Sir Jo}mn Davi4 were not a violation of solemn treaties, but emloyed to obtainthe execution of solemn treaties " Lord Palmerston goes on to show that the aggressions had been on the part of the Chinese, and not of Sir J. Davis. " Redress had beea demanded by him, and his demand had been the subject of unsuccessful negotiation." His Lordship, 'with reference to the association's criticism of the counrse pursued at Canton as "rash and injudicious," pointedly intimates that the opinion of military and naval officers, formed on the spot, on a mihltary and naval undertaking is entitled to rathemuore weight than the judgment of a commereial associatioa sitting in Liverpool. The humanitarian objections of thi association are also answered, and the generous forbearanco and noble disinterestedness and sell-denial displayed byeve,y man engaged in the operations are warmly extolled. Soene further correspondence took place, but Lord Palmerston decided, as regards the main question of principle, to leave to time apld events to decide whether the anticipations of the assoCiation as to the future result3 of the measures lately adopted by Sir J. Davis in the Canton river would be verLfled or not. The association again troubled his Lordsh:p with a communication on the occasion of the murder of sis British subjects near Canton at the end of 1847. Lord Palmerston replied that he did not see (with the association) how the event could have been prevented by the presence of * steamer off the factories at Canton.

LONDON, SATURDAY. MARCH 21 1857.
In the House of Lords last night, after some preliminary business,
The Earl of ELbiNEoRouGu took occasion, on the third reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill, to address the House on the circumstances under which nn appal had been made to the country, and contended that the charge of coalition recently made against the opposition to the Government in the Lower House was unfounded; that Sir Joint BOW-RNG waS entirely to blame for the war with China; that the finances of India wereinconfision; that our finances at home would soon be in a lamentable state from the loss of the tea dnties, and from thereckless extravagance displayed inalldepartsents of the Administration at home, and expe1llx in.
the 3fiscellaneous Estimates. The noble lord concluded by declarinig that against all this mismanagexnent tbe Govvroment had only to set the name of Lord PALMERSTON,-& Miinister without principles. Whatever inight be the result of the next election, he felt ture that the ultimate decision of the country wonld suppnrt the vote of the majority in the House of Commnons.
Lord GRAN VILLE replied, in an able speech, to the observations .f Lord ELLxNnOnOUGor, and showed that the condition of the country was not, and was not lik-ely to he, ao alarming as it was depicted by Lord ELLEN BoROUOn' simagination. It was true that the Chinese war -ould be an interruption to trade but not nearly to the extent supposed by the noble lord. It was also true that the Mliscellaneous Estimates had increased considerably, but he had no doubt that it would be proved at the proper time that the mon.y thus spent, on education for instance, would turn out to be wise economy in the end. With regard to his attack on Lord PALS=RSTON, he had no doubt that the public, a much fairer and nmuch hetter judge than apolitical adversary, would arrive at a conclusion quite opposite to that formed anti expressed with so much personality by Lord ELLS.NBOROUGH.
Lords MAIA.UMBURY, MONTEAGIL, and GRxY followed the liue taken by Lord ELaLtxBonouoH with regard to the extravagance manifested in the Miscellaneous Estimates.
The Bill was then read a third time, and passed; After which their Lordships adjourned.
It cannot be denied that the British Constitu-
It cannot be denied that the British Constitution, for all its anomalies,-and they are neither trifling nor few,-is at least a representative system. Everything centres in the constituency. We address the constituency. A thousand candidates are now sending out addresses or making speeches direct to the constituency. HBR MAuSTV's Ministers have addressed the constituency from the dinner-table of the Mansion-house, and Lord ELLENBOROuJGI has delivered a counter-address to the constituency from the House of Lords. This afternoon HER MAJESTY will address the constituency from the throne, and by half-past 2 o'clock there wiU remain nothing but a Government on its trial, and a constituency to adjudicate upon it. We are not among those who flatter the constituency; indeed, one of the numerous charges brought against us is that we do not put implicit faith in it, and that we are content to see it in safe keeping and subject to other influences. However, it is the constituency we write to and write for; and we have the credit, even in the opinion of our enemies, of knowing and foreknowing the mind of the British people with an intuitive and practised sagacity. Taking our part, then, in this great appeal to the people, we have no hesitation in saying that the simple and emphatic language of HER MLJESTrY'S FrssT MINiSTER last night will find a stronger echo and a warmer reception in the breast of the people than aU that has been said by his ingenious and eloquent adversaries. We feel sure that there is not a sound heart or candid mind in this country, of any condition or degree, which wiU not spontaneously-often, indeed, involuntarilyrespond to Lord PAImEASTox's animated and pithy address. Nor will this be due only to ability and style. Often when we have had the misfortune to differ from his Lordship as to the policy of particular measures we have done justice to the genial brightness and glow of his language, and to the adroitness with which he extricated himself and the country out of difficulties that might possibly have been avoided. There is, however, much more in this instance. The weight of Lord PALMERSTON'S words last night consists in the weight of what they stand for. They stand for certain feelings and principles deeply seated and ever active in the nature of our countrymen, making them what they are, and constituting the national character. The first duty of a British statesman is to know his countrymen. No genius or attainments will compensate for the want of this knowledge, and whoever possesses it is aure in the end to gain the day over those who have it not. Lord PiLxERSTON knows an Englishman, if anybody does.
Lord PALUMESTOx knows that it is safe to appeal to an Englishman's regard for the honour and glory of his country; to his just indignation at the long-continued) insults, the outrages, acnd cowardly acts of barbarians ; and to his equaUy keen perception of hypocrisy and trickery at home. His Lordship knows by long experience that an Englishman is apt to find a short way out of controversial difficulties, by a common-sense view of affairs. He has therefore only to ask, as he did ask last night, what Government was to do, when they heard what had taken place last November at the Antipodes, and what a Government made out of the adverse majority will have to do in logical consistency next June, and he has put a case which every true-hearted Englishman will be sure to decide one way. We are absolutely certain, were it possible for the gentlemen who declaimed with so much fury and froth against the proceedings of Hui MAJESTY'S servants at Canton to find themselves armed with powers next June, with a secure majority in Parliament, and the army and navy at their disposal, they would not send out a humble apology to Commissioner YEH. They would not inform him that he made a sufficient and ample reparation in November. They would not expose Sir Josu- BowRiNo, Sir M. Srmoui;, and Consul PARKE5 to public degradation. They would not rebuild and re-mount with guns from Woolwich aU the fortifications battered to pieces by our sailors, and the suburbs burnt by our soldiers. They would not reimburse Commissioner Yun for all the costs of his resistance. They would not compensate him for the loss of his war junks by presenting him with the fleet of gunboats now going out against him. They would not pay his head-money on the European merchants and natives in our service assassinated in consequence of his proclamation. They would not pay his bill for arsenic and for the reward of the poisoners. They would not give compensation out of the British Treasury for aU the factories, English or foreign, destroyed by the Cantonese. They would not do one of these things. Lord DxLBBY, Lord ELLENBOROUGH, Lord GaEY, Mr. DISRAELI, Mr. GLADSTONE, Nfr. S. HERBERT, Sir JAmEs GRAIIXM, and Lord J. RUssELL, may be safely trusted not to render any apology, or to perform the smallest act of humiliation, to the Chinese. Once in power they would laugh at logic, and at the credulity of their countrymen. They would inform the unfortunate Commissioner YlE that they had nothing to do with the beginning of the quarrel, and had only to prosecute the war which they found in progress to some substantial and honourable result. Such a course would be a national infamy, and would really stop our mouth for ever on all questions of humanity and justice with other nations. But we are nevertheless sure a Government constituted as we have described would take this course, and we are equally sure that at this moment, while presenting themselves to the colntry, and declaiming on the violence of our proceedings at Canton, they are fully aware they would take this course, and could take no other.
If, then, the decision of the House of Commons could possibly carry out its o;vn professed object; if it could not possibly aflfx a real and consistent censure on our proceedings at Canton, and could only end, at the most, in a gross inconsistency, what was its real motive I It was made with open eyes. Everybody knew a dissolutioni must follow. The chiefs of the Opposition. themselves admitted that necessity, and
afterwards acquieseed in it. Every one of theml knew that it was something more than an abetract expression of opinion, and muast impose on the PaEMXEr the alternative of resignation or dissolution-whichever he might thini best for his party and his cause. The dissolution was their act. 31r. COSDEN himself boasts it, while he professes himself reckless as to the political consequences of a vote dictated by feeling. The great majority of the House are not so reckless. They look to the results, and very sensibly consider that an act involves its certain consequences, and that they who do the act must take its consequences. Why, then, did these gentlemen, if not by concert, yet with accord, force upon Lord PALMIERSTONc dissolution or resignation? It could only be with a view to a new Government, which would act as we have described above, and thus infict a double blow on the reputation and strength of this country. Having first condemned our proceedings on the ground of injustice and cruelty, they would then strike a second and still more terrible blow at the national character by persisting in the course which they had themselves condemned. That is the real position of the gentlemen who are now canvassing the constituency against the Government. They desire first to humble their country before the opinion of mankind, and then to drag it through the still deeper humiliation of obstinate and deliberate wrong, of thatremorse which leads not to repentance, and that unwilling faith which b not followed by obedience. Such is the double infamy into which these gentlemen seek to plunge their country, and no other result could possibly attend their success at the approaching election. WVhat are we, then, to think of their patriotism, their sincerity, their honour and truth ? Lord PRAxIERSTON'S case is clear as the day, open throughout, and defensible to all its results. It is the clear course of national honour. The course of his opponents is also clear, and it is the path of national degradation.
One of the greatest advantages of the system of
One of the greatest advantages of the system of representative government is, that it gives to men of all classes and varieties of political opinion an opportunity for advocating their own views. Whenever any party-whenever any man of considerable capacity for public life, is excluded from tho House of Commons, then danger to the public begins. Without underrating the services which that A ssemb]y has rendered to the country through many long years of English history, we cannot but see that in our own day one of the chief benefits we derive from the institution is, that it absorbs and extinguishes demagogues and factions, whieh if they were left to ferment and fume their hour out of doors might prove very dangerous to the public tranquiUity. Let every cause have its advocate in the House of Commons. We grieved for the death of the late Sir ROBEBT LNG.LIS, because he left behind him no man who could so well represent the High Church party and the University of Oxford, with its oriel windows and its Greek iambics. In the same way we have heard with the most sincere and heartfelt regret of the illness of Mr. BIIGHT. There is not one of his friends who would rejoice more than we should do to see that gentleman restored to his political career. He is the only man of the Corn Law agitation who has made a character as a statesman or even as a politician of any considerable worth. With all his faults and errors, Mr. BRICHT had a future before him. Could he have been thrust into office for a couple of years, and had he learnt by experience the necessary distinctions between a statesman and an agitator, he might have turned out a very useful servant of the public. Even as it is, he is one of the most remarkable men who hold seats in the House of Commons. If the state of his healtb admitted of his presenee, or if there seemed a fair probability that within a reasonable time he might be restored to his friends and his Parliamentary duties, we can only say that, had we votes for Manchester, we should vote for JOHN BRIGHT. Of course, it is a misfortune that one seat for an important city like Manchester should be held in mortmain for too long a period, but the constituency are bound to showv to Mr. BRIGHT all respect and honour which may not be clearly inconsistent with a public duty. As MIr. BRIGHT believes that he may shortly be enabled to resume his Parliamentary duties, there can be no reason why he should not be taken at his word. If re-elected, and the state of his health should unfortunately prevent him from discharging his duties to his constituents, there can be no doubt that a man of public spirit like Mr. BRIGOT would feel it an imperative duty to return his trust into the hands of his. constituents. On the whole, considering the past services of Mr. BRIGHT, the distinguished position which he had won for himself in the House of Commons, the unfortunate circumstance of his illness, the possibility, we trust we may say the probability, that he may be restored to public life, and the certainty that if it be otherwise he will resign his trust, it would certainly be more graceful, more generous, more just, Hf the electors of Manchester allowed Mir. BRiGHT himself to name the moment for severing their connexion, than if they were rudely to discard him simply because he has been afflicted with bodily infirmity contracted in their service.
Of Mr. COBDEN we would speak somewhat in the same terms, although the circumstances of his case are different. As a man of political capacity and oratorical power he has proved himself on trial far inferior to Mr. BRIOHT. It is no exaggeration to say that, if the opinions of ninety-nine men out of a hundred througlhout the country be of more value than those of MIr. RICHARD COBDEN, the present member for the West Riding, and we trust the future member for Huddersfield, has not uttered one word of counsel which has been of the slightest service to the country from the day on which the Corn Laws were repealed until the present hour. During the progress of that movement manfully and zealously did he diseharge his duty; let him therefore have all honour and credit. W"e remember well at the time it was expected tlhat he wvould turn out in Parliament a fitting leader for the middle classes ; but most grievously has he disappointed the expectation. It has been found on trial that the Corn Law PAOANINi not only can play but on one instrument, but only upon a single string. He has gone wrong upon every subject he has touched; and when we say wrong, we mean wrong not only in our opinion, but according to the deliberate judgment of the vast majority of his felow-countrymen. It may be asked, theu, " Why do you recommend " him for re-election?" First, and mainly, for the sake of old times, and for the services he rendered to the country in the Corn Law days. They alone should entitle him to a seat in Parliament for life. Secondly, because of the very extreme nature of his views. We had much r2her hear Mr. COBDEN giving utterance to them within than without the walls of Parliament. Thirdly, because occasion may soon arise when his peculiar faculties may again find room for useful exercise. Finally, becanse he is a man who will in all probability be ever found in oppo3ition to the aristocratic and leading coteries which usually hold office in this country. Air. CoBDEns'S extravagant lblief in himself has been the secret of his 3uccess, as it has been the secret of his failu4t,. in life. Had he his own way he would, govern this country upon the
"el Bicarduw Cobcl" system, with a swarma of penny papers to report his speeches from hour to liour, and praise every day his political sagacity. Mr. IRIIARD COBDEN as Dr. JOHNsON, and BRIrThIA as Boswn, is about his own idea of things -as they should be in these islands. Strange is it to see the tricks which vanity can play to poor human nature. Yesterday we prinited Mr. 'COBDEN'S Mancheater speech of Thursday. in 'extenso. We find in it little but eloquent vitupera-tion of everybody save himself and his half-dozen familiar friends, at the same timie that he pours -out the vials of his wrath upon this journal for -daring to utter a word in dispraise of himself and *his select band. In spite of all this, we should -Tegret to see Mr. CosDmeIr excluded from Parliainent.
Of Mr. Mirm-xn GImsoN, the other can-didate for Manchester, we will say but little, lest it should be supposed that we were speaking with undue partiality and from private considerations. He has been the greatest beniefactor The Times ever knew. If we could only succeed in pro.curing his return, and if he would promise to conftinue his beneficent exertions in our favour, of -course we could ask no better than to see our own man returned. The electors of Manclhester, how-ever, within the last 15 or 16 years have had sample opportunity of appreciating this gentleman's zsagacity and statesmanlike powvers, and so in their fiaads we leave him. The real meaning of the pe'nding struggle at Manchester is just this-and we would have the public out of Manchester to understand the sinmple truth :-The threatened opposition at Manchester is an attempt upon the part -of the majority of the electors to rescue the borough from the dictation of the League. When -the Corn Law Repeal was carried, that body should have been dissolved; but it has been preserved for 'electioneering purposes, and has ruled the con-stituency with a rod of iron to the present hour. :Mr. COBDEN appears for the League, and Mlr. lARL-NER GiBso.N is its nominee. He is worth to us several thousands a-year; he may relieve us from the Paper Duty as he has from the Stamp and *the Advertisement Duty; if the public were less generous we should be more selfish-but, as it is, interested as we are in his success, we are not so 'ungrateful as to desire it for our owvn sake alone, and will leave it to 1Manchester to return or reject MIr. MnLz:ER Gissox.
The inaugural Message of the new American
The inaugural Message of the now American PRESIDENT will perhaps disappoint those who waited for its arrival with anxiety. It would seem that, thouih the forms of a Monarchy and a Republic may differ, the teachings of political experience are the same in both. The Session of the British Parliament is annuaUy opened with a Royal Speech, .a composition which has been the butt of several generations of satirists, but which keeps its ground because it is exactly suited to the circumstances -of our political life. Ministers wlho do not wish to appear without a policy, and are yet un-willing to commit themselves, find the meagre -but significant paragraphs of a Speech from the Thlirone the best means of indicating their intentions with a prudent vagueness. The American Republicans from the beginning refused to coun* tenance such brevity; they would have a clear narrative of the past and a clear plan of the future from the hand of their chief magistrate. Yet, as the concerns of the country become more extended, as the relations between the States be*come more delicate and complicated, as the Republic is brought more and niore into connexion with the Powers of Europe, as questions of foreign policy assume greater importance, we find that the Messages of the Presidents are more cautious and reserved, and that these powerful and almost irresponsible rulers imitate the vagueness, if they are denied the conciseness, of a Royal Speech. Mr. BUCHANAN has been elected President after the jaost exciting contest of recent times. Since our own Reform Bill there has been nothing like it on either side of the Atlantic. Americans, generally disposed to laugh at the predictions of dissension and disruption which are sometimes heard in English society, and to set them down as the voice of ignorance or jealousy, admitted that they could not help taking a -serious view of the struggle of 181H0. The anger and boisterous invective of the Southern States, the bitter resentment of the North, the fanatical excitement of the Abolitionists, and the deeds of blood in Kansas, made the contest an anxious struggle. Add to this that the foreign policy to which Mr. BUCHANAN had given his sanction at Ostend justly roused the apprehensions of more than one foreign State. England, Spain, Mexico, and even France, were aUl more or less interested in the question whether a statesman should be raised for four years to power far greater than that of a Constitutional Minister, after having seemingly subscribed to doctrines which, carried into action, would give foreign States no alternative between undignified submission and forcible resistance. As it was, the relations between England and the States were still unsettled; the questions relating to the Bay Islands and Nicaragua -were still the subject of negotiation ; and a hostile President might delay for an indefinite term the desired solution. We and all the world, as well as the Americans, took the deepest interest in the election, and, when that was decided, -waited with something of impatience for the new PRESIDENT'S political programme. This document we have at last, but it faUs far short of satisfying the curiosity which has been awakened.
Mr. BUCHANAN is certainly the most distinguished politician who has been elected to the Presidency dtring the last 20 years. More than one of his predecessors have merely profited by political combinations or political jealousies. lWhen one section would not tolerate the leading man of another section, both would unite to raise to the highest place some one whose mediocre qualities disarmed apprehension and dislike. But Mr. BUCHANAN is the leading man of his party ; he is first in ability, as in place, among the Democratic politicians of his country. We cannot suspect him of weakness, or imagine him to be sincerely commonplace; we may therefore attribute to his experience and judgment the singular nmoderation and indefiniteness of the present Mess;ge. The PRESIDENT commences by saying that, having determined not to be a candidate for re-election, he has no object but faitlhfully to serve his country during his term of office, and to live in the memory of his countrymen. As at the expiration of his Presidency Mr. BucnIAsAN will be in his, 0th year, we can well understand that he is anxious to conclude worthily a long political life by his conduct during the next four years, without look-ing further into futulity. The P.inSIDENT then declares his adherence to the principle now recoonized by the country,-that the will of the maj$Rty in each territory or State shal determine the establishment of domestic slavery. " Congress is neither to legislate slavery into any " territory or State nor to exclude it therefrom, "but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to " form and regulate their domestic institutions in "their own way, subject only to the Constitution "of the United States." This principle Mr. 13UCHANAN represents, and its enunciation is nothing new. By it slavery and non-slavery are allowed to battle it out between them without the interference of any controlling authority. Slavery may force its way up to the British frontier, and freedom may carve for itself new
domains out of the wilds of Texas. Compromises and boundary lines are now effaced. Territory will be won by either of the two systems, according to the energy and progress of its representatives. "AMay "we not, then," says Mr. BucHANAx, " hope that " the geographical parties to which the question "has given birth will become speedily extinct T., Thus is the terrible problem solved by the new Government of the United States.
The PRsIDENT;r then proceeds to point out the folly and want of patriotism displayed by those who during the late struggle hinted at and even advocated the disruption of the Union. We need not follow him into his arguiments that the preservation of this great confederacy tends to the development and civilization of every part. The fulness of the American Treasury is the gratifying subject of the next few paragraphs. This plethora of income has, it appears, given rise to wild schemes of expenditure, and called into existence a race of jobbers who threaten to corrupt the virtue of the Republic. As " a relief from this embarrassment," the PRESIDENT proposes to appropriate the surplus to great natioiial objects, the extinction of the public debt, a reasonable inerease of the navy, and the defence of the extended sea coast. The squandering bf the public money, it is then urged, sinks into insignificance compared with the waste of the public lands, and the PRFSIDEXT caUs attention to the powers inherent in Congress and in the several States with regard to this subject. The next point is the necessity of a military road from the Atlantic States to California, so that, in case of war reinforcements might be sent to the Far West without the necessity of passing round the Horn or across the Isthmus. It wil be seen that these topics are of a domestic cbaracter, and neither in themselves nor in the manner in which they are treated do they exhibit anything novel or striking. The convul-
sion of the electoral struggle has certainly passed. away, to be succeeded by a soothing calm of domestic improvement.
But what of the new PRESIDE.NT'S foreign policy? Into what are the MuNRio doctrine and the Ostend Manifesto to be developed by the triumphant champion of the Democrats ? To these questions the inaugural Message affords but vague answers. The two concluding paragraplhs are devoted to " our " rights and duties as a member of the great family " of nations." The duties, as defined by Mr. BUCHANAN, are such as might satisfy the most scrupulous international lawyer. To cultivate peace, commerce, and friendship with foreign nations, not only with a view to material interest, but in a spirit of Christian benevolence, to employ a diplomacy which shall be direct and frank, to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of nations,-such are the principles of public policy which are to guide the conduct of Mr. BCCHANAN and Mr. CASS. We are, however, next brought to the application of these principles as understood by their propounder. The Ihnited States, we are told, have never extended their dominions by the sword, for Texas was annexed by the vote of a free people, and that half of the Mexican territory -which was added to the Union ten years ago was fairly purchased after the MIexican armies had been beaten. While the American Government continues to act on this principle " nio nation will have a right to inter-
fere or complain if in the progress of events "we shall still further extend our posses-
sions." These are the most marked indications we can gain of the PREsIDENr s policy. To acqnire territory he looks upon as natural and praisewrorthy, if it be by the will of a majority of the actual settlers, or the stipulations of a pecuniary bargain. The application we must leave to the individual judgments of our readers. However, these are but tame doctrines after the Ostend Manifesto. On the whole, we think we see symptoms of that necessary moderation which accompanies the assumption of responsibility. The Government of a BUCHANAN and a CAss could not say less than is said in this inauguiral Message. Let us hope that temperance of tone will be followed by frankness of conduct, and that one of the first results will be the final settlement of those trifling differences which still exist between the two great free nations of the world.
FRATRICIDE AT MAIDSTONE.-A frightful mur-
FRATRICIDZ AT MAIDSTONE.-A frightful murder was committed on Wednesday night last at a cottage in Bedford-row, Wheeler-street, Maidstone, by a young man about 24 years of age, named George Edwards, a abourer, aud the son of poor but respectable parents residing at the same place. The victim of the fearful act is Thomas Edwards, about 18 years old, the brotber of the nsarderer. It appears that George has borne an indifferent character for two or three years past; has been of indolent and suUen habits, rarely disposed to stir out of doors during the day time, but prowling about at nights in company with person8 of bad character. The maintenance of such an idle feUow has pressed severely on his father and brother, who have been always known as civil, industrious, and sober persons ; and George has, consequently, been upbraided occasionaUy on accourt of his laziness and his stubborn and ill-regulated conduct. Two or three days ago the father procured work for this troublesome son, which, however, he refused to go to, and his brother Thomas on Wednesday, exasperated at his intractable recklessness, threatened that if he did not go to work the next day he should be turned out of doors. That evening Thomas, who had been for soune time in the employ of Ur. Stok es, market gardener, Reath-road, Maidstone, as a labourer, went to bed, as was his custom, about 9 o'clock, leaving his brother below stairs. Their mother, who was busy about her household affairs till some time after, went down into the celar about half-past 10 to chop some firewood, after which she also retired for tFe night. Immediately aiterwards she heard her son George go up to bed, shutting the door of the room in which he and his brother Tho-nassleptafterhim. She had scarcely got into bed, however, when she heard aloud moaning from the next room, and, fearing that one of her sons was ill, she arose and went into their room, and found a fearful spectacle. Her son Thomas, whomn she had shortly before looked in upon as she passed hi chamber to her own, and seen soundly sleeping, now lay stretched on the bed bleeding profusely from a number of frightful wounds on the head and face. A candlc remained stiU burning upon the clothes-chest on wvjich it had been usually placed; but George Edwards, by whom there could not exist a doubt that the murderous outrage had been committed, had disappeared, having evidently made his escape through the window, which stood open, and a number of flowerpots which had been r3nged along the window-sill overturned. Mlrs. Edwards immediately gave an alarm, and Police-constable Leney was soon on the spot, who at once sent for Mr. Sandars, surgeon and then, making search for the weapon with which the crime had been committed, found beneath the side of the hed where George usuaUy slept the chopper-a large hatchet-with which Mrs. Edwards had chopped up her fuel that night; and the surgeon, on his arrival, found that the head of Thomas had been deeply gashed with repeated heavy blows, obviously inflicted with theformidable weapon produced, which was stiU reeking with fresh blood, with human hair, and fragments of flesh. The lowerjaw had been almost severed from the head; there were two deep cuts on the forehead and cheekbone, and two others on the neck, so that the recovery of the young man was from the first hopeless. The poor fellow lingered, however, till about 8 o'clock on Thursday morning in an unconscious state, and then expired. Mr. Blundell, superintendent of the Maidstone borough police, having been informed of the occurrence, reached the houso in Wheeler-street soon after midnigbt, and promptly despatched constables in every direction in pursuit of the fratricide, who was apprehended in Rochester yesterday morning, conveyed back to Miaidstone, and charged with the crime before the mayor (Mr. Whicheord) and borough magistrates, who, at the request of Superintendent Blundell, remanded him tiU Tuesday next. An inquest was held on the body of the murdered man yesterday afternoon at the Royal George tavern, Boxley-road, before Mr. Kipping, borough coroner. The evidence adduced was mainly a recapitulation of the circumstances above detailed. Mary Ann Edwards, the mnother of the deceased, deposed that she was the wife of David Edwards, labourer, and mother of George Edwards. The deceased was 18 years old, and his brother George, 24. She then spoke to his strange and sullen disposition and habits. Sometimes he would be two hours in conibing his hair. He would leave his bed in the middle of the night, walk downstairs and go up again, seldom speaking to any person, but answering rationally when spoken to. The brothers were not in the habit of qnarreling, but they had some words on Monday last. The father having obtained work for George, the latter refused to go to it, on which Thomas threatened if he continued obstinate to turn him out of doors. That was the only provocation that had to the knowledge oS either of his parents been given. The rest 6f her evidence was but confirmatory of I the narrative above given. ,, id the inquest was adjourned
till Wednesday.

Covers were laid in the Egyptian-hall for 300, and the d'ner was served by Messrs. Ring and Brymer.
The loving cup baving circulated, the healths of Her Ma. jesty the Queen, Prince Albert, Albert Prince of Wales, and the rest of the Royal fanaily 'were severally given from the chair, andreceived with the usual manifestations of loyalty.
The LORD MA&YO then rose and said,-The next toast which I shall have the honour of introducing to your notice is one 'which will be received with the moet grateful and cordial feelings. It is to those brave soldiers and sailors who have so nobly fought the battles of our country, and shed their best blood for the purpose of upholding the honour of the British flag ir every part of the world. (Cheers.) We are tbis eveniaghonoured with the company of many distinguished heroes of both services who are entitled to our warmest thanks, and it affords me the greatest plea'uzeto propose their health. With this sentiment I shal connect Lord Panmnre and the army, and Sir Charles Wood with the navy. (Cheers.)
Sir W. F. WILLIAMS, in returning thanks for the army, referred to the unwise reduction which had been made in those subsidiary establishments upon which the strength of our army depended before the late war, and expressed his satisfaction that, under the auspices of the present Commander-in-Chief, and of the noble lord at the head of the War Department, these important branches of the service were being restored to efficiency and vigour. There was great danger in carrying retrenchment too far, for, unless well prepared for defence a wealthy country like ours, with a population of 30,000,600, would at all times find its safety menaced, its peace endangered, and its honour threatened. (Cheers.)
Sir C. WOOD.-My Lord Mayor, mry Lords, LAdlies, and Gcntlemen,-It is with great pride and pleasure that I find myself called upen to return thanks for the navy. It is with pride that I find my name associated with that noble pTofession over which I have the honour, in some measure to preside. And never do I feel that pride and pleasure greater than within these walls, where at all times and on all occasions the services of the navy are so justly and so liberaly appreciated. (Cheers.) I will not refer to the events of the late war, but to that service in which the navy in peace, no less than in war, is employed -inz., the protection of the commerce of this em. pire. That is the bond 'which connects the navy more especially with this great city, the centre and focus of our trade. It is our boast that there is no part of the globe so distant that our trade does not extend to it, and it is our pride likewise that wherever that trade
extends it finds the protection of the navy, under which it flourishes and expands. (Cheers.) Now, it is in the protection of our trado that the navy has been engaged in those hostilities which have formed the great subject of debate for some weeks past. It is in the vindication of the outraged merchant flag of Eng. Lind-in the maintenance of those immunities with. out which our commerce cannot exist-that the navy has been called upon to act in the waters of China (cheers); and I amn proud to say that the navy has there displayed its usual skill and valour. (Continued cheering.) I gladly embrace this public opportunity of expressing my opinion that, in spite of some assertions to the contrary, which I utterly disbelieve, the navy has likewise displayed that other quality for wbich the British sailor is no less dis. tinguished than for bravery-I mean his humanity. (Cheers.) I have seen with indignation the statement that unnecessary cruelty has been shown towards an unoffending people. I utterly disbelieve that accusation. I believe that no hostilities have been committed except against those bearing arms against as, and for purposes necessarily connected with the defence of the position we held. I klow that the utmost pains were taben to apare the iahabitants of 6anton-that officers were 4nded to wan the peoRle. to, removo themselves a; :their propeaty from the P&ene of eperationa -and tbat wlqn the Chinece aoldiery were.deaertod bytheir own qffiqg, and left. t& -erish tZ*Z wamo cue4 from,
a watery. grave hy British se ous. (Loud cheers.) My Lord, I hope I may h forgiven for spoaking warmly on this subject, because I feel strongly the unju,ytifiable and calumnious imputations which have been cast pen the navy. That service has at all times been distinguisged alike for bravery and humanity, and I believe that it has on this occasion in no respect faUen short of the higb character which it has long enjoyed. (Loud cheers.)
The LOPD MAYOR said,-We are this day honoured with the presence of the Prime Minister of this country, and we the citizens of London feel it a proud privilege to have the opportunity of assembling ambassadors, noblemen, and the great commercial interests, of the country n this hail. (Hear, hear.) The occasion upon which we have met is to express the confidence we have in he nobleman at the head of Her Majesty's Government, who has upon so many occasions in times of great di'diculty nobly stood forward, weathered the storm, and brought affairs to a successful issue. (Cheers.) I am sure I shall be supported when I assert,-Woe be to England when our brave soldiers and sailors are not thoroughly supported by the Government when unexpectedly caUed on to take decisive measures on any great emergency. The noble Premier is about to appeal to the nation to express its opinion on the course he has adopted, and every lover of his country looks with confidence to the result. I therefore propose to you, "1 The bealth of Viscount Palmerston, and may he long be spared to gluide the councils of our land." (Loud and prolonged cheering.)
Lord PALMRSTON;, who was received with loud cheers, said,-My Lord Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen,-Often as it has been our good fortune to partake of the splendid hospitalities of the city of London, I may certainly say that it never fell to the lot of any Administration to receive those testimonies of courtesy and goodwill upon a more important andinteresting occasion than the present. (Cheers.) We are not deceiving ourselves, my Lord Mayor, when we interpTet the manner in which you have been pleased to propose our health as a renewal of that expression of confidence and goodwill towards Her Majesty's Ministers which I had the honour of receiving not many davs ago from your Losdship, as evidencing the feelings and opinions of the citizens of this great metropolis. (Cheers.) We were not long ago, as is well known, placed in a minority in the House of Commons upon a question which involved a censure upon Her Majesty's Government. I know very well that some of those who honoured us with their general support, viewing that question merely as a simple expression of judgment on a particular transaction which had talen place at the antipodes some months before, persuaded themselves that in giving their votes against the Government they were not pronouncing a censure upon the Administration; and some of those hon. gentlemen assured me-lam convinced withgreat sinceritythat they did not intend by the votes they gave to withdraw from theGovernment the general confidence they had hitherto extended to it. (Cheers.) But the great majority of those who voted knew perfectly well the full political import of their votes. The resolution was that the proceedings which the Government have approved were unjustifiable; and if the Governmeat have approved unjustifiable proceedings, they have followed a course which deservedly must incur the censure of the Parliament and the people of England. We were persuaded, on the contrary, that those proceedings were right and necessary. We felt that great wrong had been inflicted upon this ceountry. We felt that our fellow-countrymen in a distant part of the globe had been exposed to every sort of insult, outrage, and, atrocity (loud cheers); that a treaty with this country had been broken; and that those who were locally charged with the defence of our interests were not only justified in resorting, but were bound to resort, as far as he means at their command enabled them, to the measures requisite for their vindication. We felt that we should have been basely betraying a tru.st which our Sovereign nd the country had reposed in us if we had not approved proceedings which we thought right, and which if we had been placed in similar circumstances we should certainly have deemed it our duty to adopt. (Cheers.) Well, my Lord Mayor, in ordinary cases, wheu the House of Commons censures a Government, that Government has but one course to pursne-namely, to retire, especiaUy if t thinks that the country at large shares the opinions pronounced by its representatives; but on the present occasion our belief was different. We did not believe that the country at large shared their opinions. (Prolonged cheering.) I took the liberty, during the late debate, of saying to the House of Commons that I was sure their vote, if it were adverse to us, would not be ratified by the opinion of the country, and the result has proved how entirely we were justified in entertaining that conviction. We have even now, before the constituencies have had an opportunity of recording their votes, had numerous expressions of opinion from all parts of the united kingdom-addresses from men of aU ranks of society, and of alU shades of politics-from Whigs, Tories, and Radicals-declaring it right that when the interests of the country are at stake party differences should be forgotten, and the whole people should raRy to ether to vindicate the honour of the empire. (Cheers.) We know-our fellow-countrymen know well-that such wiUl be the result of the appeal we are about to make, and even now, although the time when that appeal can practically be answered has not yet arrived, we have proof that the heart of the country is sound, and that it wil reverse the censure which was passed upon us the other day by the House of Commons. (Cheers.) It seems that it is not permitted to me to talk of coalitions or combinations, because they have been distinctly repudiated; but there was, if I am obliged to say so, an accidental concurrence of the leaders of opposite parties in the lobby against us. (Laughter.) In that lobby there were the elements of a Government which expected to succeed to power by making the humiliation and degradation of their country a stepping-stone to oflice. (Cheers.) We are truly told that party spirit and party ties are essentialto theworkingof the British oonstitution. Somepartytieswereremembered on thatoccasion, butonepartytie was whollyforgotten-the tie that ought to bind every Englishman to the interests, the honour, and the glory of his country. (Cheers.) If those who voted against us had risen to power, what ought they to have done as the logical and inevitable consequence of their vote 9 They asserted that our proceedings were unjustifiable. They were bound, therefore, in the event of their success, to have apologized to the Chinese barbarians for the wrongs we had done-to have rebuilt the forts which oUr gallant sailors had destroyed-to have sent from Woolwich new cannon in lieu of those which cur brave seamen had rendered unservieeable-and at the same time, in order to complete the measure of redress, they must have paid the rewards which bad been given for the heads of our merchants, and the cost of the arsenic which had been used in poisoning our fellow-subjects at Hongkong. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I cannot envy the feelings of those men who could witness with calmness the heads of respectable British merchants on the walls of Canton, or the murders and assassinations and poisonings perpetrated on our fellow-countrymen abroad, and who, instead of feeling-their blood boil with indignation at such proceedings, would have had us make an abject submission to the barbarians by whom these atrocities were committed. (Cheers.) But we are told by others that we are addicted to war. We are told that while we direct affairs this country will always be embroiled with other nations. Why, Sir, our conduct is a refutationi of that charge. (Cheers.) Some of the men who are now foremost in advocating these doctrines of peace were among those who concurred in engaging the country in that necessary war-the first geat struggle in which we have been engaged during thelt 40 years. These men, however, forgot to help us to carry that war through to a successful termination; they did not assist us in obtaining, in conjunction with our glorious allies, the Prench, the Sardinians, and the Turks, that safe and honourable peace the conditions of which these men had before pronounced to be unreasonable to ask and hopeless to obtain. They forget to assist us in that, and when they accuse us of aU inveterate propensity for war they overlook the fact that we succeeded in restoring peace to Europe. (Cheers.) We, too, are for peace abroad and for progressive improvement at home, but the peace which we want is peace with honour, peace with safety, peace with the maintenance of our national
rtghts eace with security to our fellow count-ymen a road 1Cheers.) We believe that that is also the opinion of the British nation, and as long as the nation regards these as the principles upon which the government of the country istobeconductedaslong asit shall continuetohonour us with its confidence, so long shall we feel pride in discharging the duty, however laborious and responsible it may be, which our Sovereign and her people introit to us. (Cheers.) If the day should come when a different doctrine shal prevail-when peace is to be sought by hu^t~io and degradation, the country must
lok elsewhere- I will not now Ia where (laughter and cheers); the country I say must look elsewhere for the in-truinents of the national dishonour and disgrace. (Cheers.) My Lord Mayor and gentlemen, I again beg to assure you that we feel proud, justly proud, of the noble spirit which the country has exhibited npon the present occasion; a spirit which it will always display when national interests are at stake. We feel doubly proud of being the instruments of the national wiL and as long as we feel that we are so backed up, we esall set at defiance the accidental concurrence (laughter) of unconcerting and uncommunicating gentlemen (renewed laughter), who by a strange fatality may find themselves United in a vote to turn out the Government of the day. (Enthusiastic and prolonged cheeTing.)
The L4RD MAYOR said,-The presence of the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers in this hall gives us an assurance of the support and cordiality of feeling which exists between the great Powers of Europe and other parts of the world, and we are anxious to take every opportunity of notifying to them the pleasure we feel in their presence, and the deep interest we take ir the progress and prosperity of the great nations they represent. I propose "the health of thelforeignAmbassadorsandMinisters who havehonoured us with their company," and couple the toast with the illustrious name of Count Persigny. (Cheers.)

(Cheers.) Avec ce genie pratique des anaires qui caract6rise ce pays, la cit6 de Londres avait admirablement appr6dci6 la situation relative des doux peuples. Elle avait vu, avant tout le monde, qu'il n'existait plus ontro les deux puissmnee, l'une plus specialement militare et l'autre plus sp6cialement maritime, aucun sujet veritable de rivaliit6 quo da moment oft l'Angleterre etait en pleiue possession des avantaLges que la Providence semble lui avoir r6sorv6s par sa position insulaire, ses richesses minGrales, et le g6nie particulier de sea habitants,-que du moment, en un mot, oil eUe avait acquig la supr6matie industrielle et commerciale, coloniale et mnaritime, ello ntaait zien -1 gagner A une nouveUe coalition contre la France, mais avait au contraire tout avantage & rechercher son arniti6.

The LORD MAyro said,-The House of Lords has ever proved itself one of the greatest bulwarks of our constitution. In aU times of difficulty it has proved Itself the champion of true liberty and the sincere friend of the people. Irise, therefore, wfith feelings of the most profound respect to propose "The health of the Peers of England," and with it I vill mention the name of Lord Cranville (cheers), who is always ready to unite with us in all that affects the happiness of mankind. (Loud cheers.)
Earl GRANVLLE.-My Lord, ladies, and gentlemen, I rise to return thanks, first on behalf of the peers who are present, and next for the assembly to which we belong, for the honour which you have done us in drinklng our healths. Speaking for those who are present, I beg to returnyou our most sincere acknowledgments forthe cordial welcome which you have given us this day, for the occasion on which you have summoned us to meet you (cheers), and I may perhaps be allowed to add for the very exceUent dinner which we have just enjoyed (a laugh), and in which you have combined the old. traditional disbes of the city with the most modern inventions of the art of cookery. I happened the other day to cast myeye oversomo advertisements, and among them I saw an announcement of a new sauce of peculiar excellence, (A laugh.) It was stated that it had a most exquisite flavour, and would impart the greatest zest and spirit to the viands with which it might be used. The name of this sauce was the " Palmerston sauce," and I venture to think that you have given us an opportunity of tasting the genuine article in the greatest possible perfection. (Cheers and laughter.) I am sure that this company, composed of well-educated Englishmen, perhaps as weU acquainted as we are with the institutions of our country, vnll not expect me to deliver a constitutional ess2y upon the House of Lords (a laugh); but there are some advantages arising from the existence of that assembly which are universally recognized, and to which I may, without impropriety, refer. Although ours is not the most important branch of the Legislature, yet, undoubtedly, it is that which those countries which have adopted our representative institutions bave found it most difficult to imitate,; aud it is worthy of remark that this House is so open to talent and ability of all descriptions that any citizen of London who gives his child a good education may feel that it is quite within the verge of possibility that his son may take his seat among the most ancient peers of the realm. (Cheers.) TheHouse of Lordshassometimesdonegood service, not by finaUy stopping measures which have been demanded by the people, but by interposing a useful delay during which the H ouse of Commons and the nation at large might reflect and fully make up their minds upon the import of these measures. (Cheers.) On a late occasion there was under discussion a question, not of legislation, but of the action of the Excoutive Government. On that occas.on the House of Lords was very severely tested. Some of the most eloquent speeches which were ever heard within the waUs of Parliament were then delivered. To the spiritual peers appeals were made which seemed to threaten them with the censure of their feUow-countrymen if they voted according to their consciences and in favour of the Government. Those spiritual lords, or at least the great majority of them, disregarded these appeals, and resolved to act only in accordance with tbe dictates of their own judgment. In the adoption of that course they must have felt that an excellent example had been set them by their humbler but most useful brethren who aro engaged in spreading the gosl in a distant land, and who had the fullest knowledgo of the facts and merits of the case recently so much agitated. We were told that we could not in this instance trust to the opinion of those merchants who were most interested in the question, but, although only some half dozen of us are directly interested in the trade and manufactures of this country, we felt that our relations with China consisted chiefly of commercial intercourse, and that we could depend upon the judgment of those honourable and enlightened men who were ongaged in such avocations, and who, instead of consulting their own interests, were actuaUy making great pecuniary sacrifices, because they thought that the placing our relations on a moro satisfactory footing would lead to such an extension of commerce as would be beneficial not only to ourselves, but also and at least equally to the subjects of the Emperor of China. (Cheers.) The noble viscount (Palmerston) has referred to the fact that the House of Commons has come to a different decision ; but I do feel some confidence that the country, which is now about to be consulted, will think, as I rejoice to find this assembly does, that in this instance the Rouse of Lords has been the most faithful exponent of the wishes and feelings of the people (cheers), and I venture to say that all who are present to-night wiU think that we had 30 good reasons for the coarse which we took (a laugh), and that, notwithstanding your liberal feelings and associations, yo vwill with alU sincerity repeat the sentiment of a Tory poer, " Thank God! we have a House of Lords." (Loud cheers.)
The LORD MAYOR said,-Nations are like individuals, strengthened mad upheld by the confidence felt in them, and the uprightness w-;h' which they deal with others, The public re ations of this country to other States are of the highest importance toits dignity and welfare, whether viewed as regards the benefits yielded by commerce, the advantage of social intercourse, or the maintenance of these relations of friendship by which the progress of society and the improvemnent of mankind are gradually developed. England occupies a proud position in the eyes of the world, and her ioreign relations are consequently placed at all times in the hads of statesmen of great ability and high character. In the present instance we have a nobleman conducting our foreign relations who bears one of the great names of English history, and who has proved by his ability and energy in times of trial that he can maintain the repiLtation of a great title. (Cheers.) By his care and watobfolness difficult questions affecting the peace and tranquillity of Europe are dealt w ith, and I propose with peculiar satisfac-
tha the cordial expression of the feelings of this assembly be offered to Lord Clarendon, with their beat wishes that he may long continue to administer the foreign relations of this country, so as to maintain its honour and preserve the peace of the world. (Loud cheers.)
The Earl of CLARYUNDO-, on rising to acknowledge th toast, was received with great cheering. He said, My Lord Mayor, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I am truly grateful to the Lord Mayor for having coupled my
name with the toast which ho has just proposed to this distinguished ssembly. Tho sucess and permanence of our foreign relations involve considerations the importance of which it is impossible to overestimate, and no one who fills the office which I have the honour to hold can fail to be sensiblo of the responsibility of tho Government to the country forthe mannerin which its policy is conducted ; or, on the other hand, can question the right of the country to inquire whether the Government, while upholding the honour, the dignity, and the interests of England, is careful at tho same time to respect the honouraud dignityof other Powers, anddoes nothing tolessen the esteem of our allies, or to endanger the permanence
of peace. (Cheers.) Such have been the principles upon vhich our policy hbas been founded, and we may confidently appeal to facts notorious to tho whole world whether in our hands the honour of England has been sullied,
her dignity lowered, or her interests impaired.
(Cheer j Neo one who listened to the able and eloquent address of the representative of France can have any fear for the friendliness of our relations with that and other countries. (dear.) Among the numerous foreign
Minsters who are here present to-night I have great pleasure in seeiugthe PerslanAmubeador, who has beenreeeived by Hler MIajesty i4erder that he ight present to her the credentials with whiekbe had been furnnnhed by his own Sovereiga in anticipation of an event wFhich has been
happily zoaliid in the conclusion of a just, honour. able, and: i ry peace. (Cheera ) But we me
told that ¢r foreign p Ucy is "turbulentt ahd Aggressive." Although it PW. be difficult to prove a negatiTe, I think that that polcy not ""turbu lent" which has bc,t conducted ath *n extreme re' Inctance to go to war, and which, within 12 months, bas been signalized by the conclus, n of two treaties of peace; uor cau that yolicy be ed " a^gressive 'which sought no tetorialu !1 sired no ¢xcIlive advants a ri r
by suceels to demasnd anything beyond the obj, Icts for wIrh! hostilities were undertaken. (Cbeers.) Perhbaps b 't no period! of our history has so great a mass of official orre pondenco connected with foreign affairs been laid bel. o? the public as within the last throe or four years, and I, ill ask any oneo whether-although we have felt bound to up.hold iterests which we thought just-we have injured 0our cause by adopting any course to which the term.
" braggadocial cai be truly applied ? (Cheers-)t. Nevertheless, we wero told that wa have alienated our friends' and that our a;liances are not permanent. We were lately told that we were wliing to sacrifice even the French alliance for a worthless object by our obstinate pertinacity. Well, you have heard the French Aitbassador testify to the state of our alliance with the country which he represents; (cheers); and if we have ever had any difference with France, it has been that honest difference which may take place between friends, and when such a difference has existed we have sought for and have found an honourable solution. (Hear, hear.) the coneuence has been the maintenance in all its integrity and cordiality of that alliance which has been so beneScial to both countries, and the increase of that mutual respect and esteem, without which no alliance and no friendship, be it between individuals or nations, can be eitber sold or enduring. (Cheers.) I may also observe of that country with which we have lately been at war, and which we esteem and respect as a noble foe, that the differences which have occnrred since the signature of the treaty of peace have all disappeared. They have all been settled in an honourablo and satisfactory manner-in a manner which, I trust, will leave no soreness or illfeeling behind. Time alone-and a very short time, too, I am convinced-is necessary in order to knit together in alliance two countries having so many interests in common. (Hear, bear.) I will not venture to trespass on your patience by travelling in our justification. as Islonld like to do, over the map of Europe; I will only say I believe that at no time in recent years has there existed so thoroughly sound and wholesome a feeling as now
revails between the people of this country and the United gtates, who, understanding their reciprocal interests. feel a determination that those interests shall not be disturbed by quarrels and disagreements, which may partially derange, though they do not interrapt, our friendly communications. I believe that this amicable feeling is shared as well by the Government of the UTnited States as by the Government of Her Majesty, and we have this advantage-that the eminent man who has nrow been raised by the voice of his countrymen to preside over the destinies of thoee States has but recently left our shores, has lived among us, has mixed with all classes of our people, and has been able to appreciate the esteem and respect felt for his country by all sections in these kingdoms. (Hear.) Before I sit down I cannot help adverting to what fell from the First Lordof the Admiralty with regard to China,-a uee tion which has lately engrossed all men's minds, and wThich has produced results so widely different from those which were anticipated by parties who did not coalesce orcombine, but who happened to unite (a laugh) in censuring the Government for doing that which any Government must have done in their place (cheers), if they believed, as we did, that a deliberate insult had been offered to the Britsh flag, and if they knew, as we did, that upon the protection which that flag affords depends the safety of every British interest. Xly right hon. friend has made a most just and true defence of Sir Mlichael Seymour, and I wish also to add that in my opinion Sir J. Bowring has been most unfairly treated. (Cheers.) Every species of vitnperation and abuse has been goured upon him, and Iam convinced that Sir MI.
Seymour, hL-o every brave and honourable man, will not onlly expect, but wiU claim, to share the responsibility with Sir J. Bowring. (Renewed cheers.) It is impossible that officers far from home, and without instructions, should not assume a certain amount of responsibility; and when they do so, and act to the best of their judgment and ability,1 think it is cruel and ungenerous, and I am surer it is impolitic, not to put the best construction upon their motives and conduct, and not to believe that men placed in such difficalt circumstances must be the most competent judges of the requirements of the emergency. (Hear, hear.) We approved the conduct of our officers. For that we have been censured by the floune of Commons; and thereupon my noble: friend at the head of the Government has determined to ascertain whether the country agrees in that censure. The manner in which that appeal has been responded to, and, above all, the enthusiastic manner in which my noble friend has been received by this assembly, are the best justification of our conduct, and the best proof that we should hbve acted unjustly towlards our officers if we hAd not upheld their proceedings and maintained the honour of the British flag. (Loud cheers.)
The LORD MAYOR then proposed " the Church, couphs with the toast the naine of the Bishop of London.
Ohe right rev. PRELATE briefly returned thanks.
Lord PALiERSTON, in complimentary terms, gave " the health of the Lord Mayor," which was drunk with much cordiality.
The LORD MAYOR acknowledged the toast, and proposed "the House of Commons," associating with it the name of Sir George Grey.
Sir G. GREY returned thanks.
Theremaining toasts included "the Lady Mayoress,' which was gracefully proposed by the Dake of ARGYLL, and " the Bar of England," which was responded to by Sir F-

By the arrival of Her Majesty's ship Duke of Wellington at Spithead yesterday we have advices from Lisbon to Mlarch 12.
After a fortnight's Ministeral crisis, and the failure of every effort to reorganize a new Cabinet out of the Progresista party, the Marquis de Loul6 and Viscount Sa da Bandeira have formed a coalition witlh three deputies belonging to the Chartist or Conservative Constitutionalist party, and I am assured the Administration will to-day be officially declared in the Cortes as follows :-
The Mlarquis de Loul6, President of the Council, Nlinister of Foreign Affairs, and, ad interim, of the Home Department.
Viscount Sa da Bandeira, Minister of Marine and, ad interim, of War.
M. Antonio Jos6 d'Avila, Minister of Finance.
M. Carlos Bento da Silva, Minister of Public Works.
M. Vicente Ferrer Netto, Minister of Justice.
By this reconstruction of the Loul6 Cabinet two Ministers went out-MAI. Julio Gomes and Cunba Pessoa, and three new ones have taken office. M. Avila has formed part of several Administrations, but M. Carlos Bento, chief of department in the Treasury, and M. Ferrer, professor in the University of Coimbra, have not before been Ministers of State, though they have continually been members of the House of Deputies, and evinced considerable ability as debaters.
It is very probable the new Ministry will, equally with the last, have a good working majority in the Lower House, but it is extremely difficult to say whether this or any other combination of parties will be able to command one in the Upper House without the creation of a new batch of Peers, so equally divided does that House appear to be, and so conscious is each party of its power to give a check to any Administration by suddenly sending for half-a-dozen of those Peers who are usually absent; and thus, so longas the ]King allows it to beunderstood hewill notereatenewones, it does not appear thli difficulty in levislation can be overcome, and permit the appointment of au Administration likely to carry on public affairs any length of time, which would be very desirable for the interests of the country.

(FROM OR OWNr COORRESPONDflT.1
[A portion of the following appearod in our second edition of vesterdaa:-1
PARIS, !Arcn 19, 6 p.mr.
The Government received yesterday news from Nwaples. It is said that a reconciliation ith France and England is becoming not merely possible, but probable, and that an Attache of the French fforeign-office wrill soon leave for Naples on a private mission.
Lord Elgin is expected to visit Paris previous to his depsrture for China, in order to confer with the French Government. I give this as an on dit, without vouching for its correctness.
Colonel Oklewsky, Chief of Division of Railways at St. Petersburg, has arrived in Paris. his vist relates to the construction of railways in Russia.
b.L Huibner, the Austrian Minister in Paris, has been thanked in the name of the Emperor of the French for the attention of the Emperor of Austria in placing the statue of the 76rst Napoleon in the public gardens of Milan.
A private letter from Vienna announces that news had been received in that city by telegraph that the General commanding the troops of occupation in Moldavia had quitted Jassy on the 16th, and, with the whole of the officers at head-quarters, was on his way towards the frontier. The nfantry had already quitted the country, and there onlyremained some detachments of cavalry and a quantity of stores. It was believed that the evacuation would be complete on the 25th.
A letter from Galatz, of the 4th inst., states that, in conformity with the decision of the Paris Congress, which declared that the delta of the Danube should be restored to Turkey, Omar Bey had entered Sulina at the head of 150 men, and had taken possession of the country in the name of his Sovereign. The Austrians at Sulina had received orders to leave.
Changes are spoken of as likely to talke place among the upper classes of the magistracy, such as the retirement of M. Troplong from the Presidency of the Court of Cassation, and M. Delangle to succeed him. The destination which rumour again gives to MI. Troplong is that of Arch-Chancellor of the Empire. M. de Royer Procureur-General of the Court of Cassation, would, under such circurnstances, be named First President of the Court of Appeal.
It is also said that M. Roulaud, Minister of Public Instruction, is likely to be transferred to the Home Department, and that M. Vaisse, now Procureur-General at the Court of Paris, will take the Department of Public Instruction.
T'he Paris papers have been directed to discontinue the discussion on the civil war in La Vendee, in the great Revolution. That discussion was occasioned by the funeral sermon of the Bishop of Poitiers on the Marchioness de Larochejacquelein, who died a week or two ago, and who, as every one knows, played a distinguished part during that struggle, and afterwards wrote a most interesting history of it. The Bishop of Poitiers seemed to regard all those who fell in that war as martyrs to the cause of religion and legitimacy. The Sitele made some angry comments on the discourse; these were replied to by the Univers and Unioni; the Si&ole rejoined; and the dispute soon waxed warm. The question was about to enter into a new phase, when the authorities stepped in, and separated the combatants.
In my letter of the 9th inst. the following phrase occurs:-" M. de Cesena informs his readers, through the columns of the Constitutioniel, that the ' West Riding' is the partie Orientale de Loeusresthe ' East end of London.' This, I presiume, is sufficient." 1ll. de Cesena has addressed a letter to you in which he denies, in terms not over-courteous, but which it would perhaps be unreasonable to criticise too closely, that no such geographical error as the one noticed was committed, and that Mr. Cobden's name was not mentioned. If M. de Cesena will take the trouble to look at his paper, the Constitutiouncl, of that date, he wiU find in his first page the following paragraph, taken from the miscellaneous inteUigence supplied for the information of his readers, and which I give in the original French:-
"Le Globe annonce quo les 6lecteurs du West Riding (la partie orientale de Londres) paraissent dispos63 i porter Lord Paluerston comnme candidat dans les prochaines 6lea. tions, en remplacement de Mi. Cobden."
Now, M. de Cesena is not merely an editor of the Con.stitutioniel, he is also its responsible director; his name appears affixed both to his "premiers Paris," or leading articles, and to the foot of its last colunmn. It gives, I suppose, to all that precedes much the same authority and sanction that the last visa does to the strange stamps and uncouth scrawls on the back of a well-worn passport. M. de Cesena and the Cowstitutioynel are, in point of fact, regarded by the public as convertible terms.
M. de Cesena apprehends that I do not read the articles of the Consitittionnel. lHe is mistaken; I have, indeed, more courageous resignation than he gives me credit for; and, w ithlout boasting, it is all the more meritorious, as it is one of the rare instances of the pursuit of knowledge under great difficulties.
The blunders of the French press in its notices of neighbouring countries are, with rare exceptions, proverbially ludicrous. If they are not instructive, however, they are at any rate amusing, and in this species of involuntary merit M. de Cesena's paper is pre-eminent. In order to avoid similar mistakes in future, I would, with due respect, recommend a well-known work of the Abb6 Gaultier. It is an elementary treatise on geography made easy; it is much used in the primary schools, and would form a useful addition to the library of the Gonstitlutionizel.
The Abeille du Nord says
"The prevailing animosity against England lately caused a sad and unfortunate scene at Moscow. Professor Schevyreff, of the UnJiversity of that city, having loudly blamed Sir Robert Peel's speech on Russia, by saying that he had calumniated a country which had afforded him hospitality, concluded by cauing him an ungrateful fellow. Count Bohrynski, who was present, took Sir Robert Peel's part, demonstrating that his reproaches against Russia were well founded. M. Schevyreff, becoming excited, struck Coant Bohrynski on the face; the latter, infuriated, rushed on the professor, and struck him with such violence that he died two days after."

Abou a frtnght inc 'We ere informed that here was a very considerable concen,tration of reuAlax troops in Bulga-ria, and -we have nowf learnt rhat is intended. The Turkish Government weing of opinion that preventio is in itl
,etter than cure, has resolved to Ilc oe l
-msion on theo. WalUachian and another on the
Russo-Bessarabian frontier. The Porte is said to be firmly resolved not to consent to the lnion of Moldavia and Wallachia; and if the refusal of the Sultan to accede to any of the wishes expressed by the Divans ad hoc should lead to disturbances Turkish troops will at once cross the Danube. Redschid Pasha and Lord Stratford agree in think-in that the union of the Danubian Principalities would be an advantage to PRussia equivalent to a pitched battle won against the allies. According to one of the Viennapapers, the Grand Vizier a few days since plainly told Messrs. de Thoavenel. and de 80outenieff that it was not to be expected the Sultan would consent to diminish his own suzerain rights and privileges iii Moldavia and Waachia. Some of the Paris papers have recently informed the public that Austria will not object to the union of the Danubian Principalities " if the great Powers consent to guarantee to her the countries in the Austrim Empire which are inhabited by Roumans." This statement is most ridiculous, and just as false as the other report, that the Imperial Government intends to grant a constitution to the Auatro-Roumaus.
Yesterday you were told that the Jesuits had established themselves in the suburb of Leopoldstadt, and information has to-day been given me that the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna made a fruitless attempt to introduce them into the suburbs of Alser and Rossau. To the astonishment of his Grace, the rectors of the two suburbs mentioned refused to permit the followers of Loyola to preach in their churches, "because their parishioners were not so desperately wicked as to require such violent lang,uage as the Jesuit missionaries were in the habit of addre6sing, to their audiences."

BERIN, MMAc= 18.
The St. Petersburg journals speak of the Emperor's intention of visiting Italy and France in the spring. It may be presumed that he will pass this way to the south, as a letter from him to a high official was lately shown by the latter at a ball given to him by the authorities at Kieff, in which the Emperor spoke positively of his coning thither on a certain day next April. The town of Riga is soon to cease to be a fortHied town; it appears as if the Government was about to give the civicauthorities permission to rase aU the fortifications, with the exception of the citadel, at thei r own expense.
The Emperor has commanded that the practice of copying and forwarding to the Minister of the Interior al the papers that strangers visiting Russia bring with them shall be discontinued; in future they are to be forwarded to the provincial Government of the place when the stranger enters the empire. This measure, taken in comnexion with the improvementsof thepassport system for Russians desirous of travelling, may be taken as an earnest of the Emperor's desire to promote intercourse between his subjects and the western world. Passports are now issued by the chefs of all the provincial Governments, instead of the Minister of the Interior alone, without the necessity of providing any medical certificate, and, instead of a separate passport being required for every separate person at an expense of 100 roubles each, the names of a whole family and their servants can now be entered on a single passport.
Not long back t-e Minister of the Interior issued a circular to all the officials under his control, warning them not to imagine that the production of the enormous quantities of writing was the best fulfilment of their duties, as they seemed to think. He pointed out to them that, while they were devoting so much writing to very unimportant matters, others of great importance were very frequently neglected; that many officials, on finding the evil consequences of their ill-directed energies, were led to resort to artifice to conceal their own misconduct. From the Minister's severe strictures we learn that one of the tricks usually adopted to screen these derelictions of duty is for the officials in fault to get the papers in question conveyed to some very distant department of another Government, as if by accident or mistake of the porters, so that the evils inflicted on petitioners in matters of personal liberty or damage to property often made these artifices on the part of the officials highly criminal. The language of the Ministerial circular is most unsparing and drastic, and strikes the axe to the root of the great curse of the Russian A dministration, the accumulation of mountains of Bumaggenv (written official papers), which only encumber the transaction of the business of the Government. The numerous orders and rescriptsthat the Minister has issued on this subject between 1853 and 1855 are now about to be collected by the Emperor's command, and published again as a whole, for the benefit of the whole hierarchy of officials throughout the country.

MONEY-HAfRlKatid OITYZNTBLLIaENCB
The English funds have not beeDay toeingy, but the market has shown-a tendency to increased firmness. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 931, were first quoted 93i to i, and towards the close there was a further improvement, the final transactions being at 93V to i for money, and 93k for the 8th of April. Exchequer-bonds closed at 98- 1b 99; India-bonds, 2s. dis. to 2s. pm.; and Exchequer-bills, par to 4s. premium.
There was an adequate supply of money to-day, both in the Stock-Exchange and the discountmarket, at previous rates.
Foreign securities, with the exception of Mlexican, were well supported, although the operation; were unimportant. In Turkish Six per Cents. th'
transactions for the account were at 98k, i, and 98 ; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for money. were dealt in at 101 and 101i. Owing to sales of Mexican a reaction of abont a-half per cent. toot place, the bargains for the account having been aS 23l, ;, and J. The general business comprisedPortuguese Three per Cents., 1856, 44k; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91 and 91k; Spanush Three per Cents., 41J; and Spanish Passive, 5&.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon,the rates generally were a shade higher than last post.
The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 85c. for money, and 71f. 10c. for the end of thE month, showing a recovery from the decline of i per cent. which occurred yesterday.
The corn-market this morning was again very dull at the quotations of Monday.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business without change in prices.
In colonial produce during the week there has been little alteration, the prices of the leading staples, owing to the moderate extent of the supplies brought forward having been generally we!l maintained. An absence of animation, however, continues to prevaiL For sugar there has been a slightly increased inquiry on the part of exporters, but a tendency to speculation in native Madras subsided to-day, and the slight improvement previously established was not supported. Notwithstandingr the light stocks held by the trade they have bought sparingly. A considerable quantity of unclayed Manilla has changed hands for shipment at 29s. 3d. to 29s. 9d. ; also a cargo of clayed at 35s. 6d. for an outport. The Netherland Trading Company's sale of Java this week went off at 1 to 2 guilders above the valuations, Dutch refiners taking about half the quantity. The coffee-market has been quiet, with a limited demand from the trade, but a cargo of St. Domingo brought an extreme price for a near port. Native Ceylon has been sold at 59s. 6d. to 60s., showing a trifling decline. A good business has been transacted in rice for the continent at an occasional advance. The only feature in spice has been a speculative inquiry for pimento, which closes higher, a large portion of the stock here finding buyers. The few sales effected in saltpetre show a reduction of Is. to is. Gcd., although the stock keeps at a very moderate point. In rum extensive operations have been effected at rather higher quotations. There is an improved feelng in the tea-market, although the arrivals have been large. Common congou has been dealt in to some extent at Is. 0Ad., and it is not now to be purchased under is. 0O per lb.
A circular has been addressed to the proprietors of certain vineyards in the Douro by Mfr. J. J. Forrester, offering on specified conditions to apply aremedy againstthe vine disease at his own expense. He has studied the different methods adopted in other countries, and under the conviction that he will be able to do some good he proposes to undertake the whole cost of the operation without receiving any return unless the quantity of grapes gathered shaU be double that of last year. on the other hand, in case of success, he is to receive half the surplus.
Letters from Christiania of the 10th inst. give particulars of the railway extensions contemplated in Norway. The Compte Rendu, or report of the condition of the country, read to the Storthing after the Royal speech at the opening of the Assembly, states :-" The traffic on the railway between Christiania and Lake Miosen (the Norwegian trunk) has increased considerably, and the prospects of the line have become so encouraging as to deserve a special report, which, in combination with the project for the construction of the new lines, will be laid before the Storthing." Of these new lines the most important is one projected by theGovernment from a centralpoint of thetrunk lineto Kongsvingen and the Swedish frontier, a distance of about 70 miles, where it is to effect a junction with the main line in Sweden to Stockholm, and thus unite the two capitals. The second is from the town of Hamar on the Miosen to Ostererdal. Both projects have been favourably received by the Assembly, and the first is exDected to be carried out by the State. It is added that owing to the continuous increase of traffic on the trunk line, and the reduction of the working charges, which do not now exceed 50 per cent., the non-preference shares have greatly improved in price, aud a proposition was about to be miade that the dividends on the Five per Cent. Preference Shares should be paid half-yearly instead of yearly. These advices also mention that an Englishman, Mr. S. H. Thomas, has been returned as a member of the Norwegian Storthing.
According to advices from Sydney by the last mail the result of the North Australian Exploring Expedition has not realized the expectations that had been entertained. The part of the northern country which it was most desirable to explore still, it is said, " remains untouched, and is as great a blank on the map as ever, the want of water and the desert aspect of the country having for the present prohibited its examination." Much interesting information was, however, believed to have been collected. The following are the conclusions of the &Sydney IIerald with regard to the points thus fur ascertained:-
"It would seem now to be proved to a certainty that no large rivcrs discharSe themselves into the Gulf of Carpentarina; and that the dividing range which separates the northern from the southern watershed is not far from the coast. Leichhardt, in his north-westerly course, crossed them all; and now, Mr. Gregory, in returning over the same ground, has recrossed them again by a route nearly parallel to that of his5predecessor. He has endeavoured, too, to keep as near to the sources of these streams and as far from the coabt as possible, ret in no case was he able to find water further thanl100 miles from the sea. The Plains of Promise dLicovered by Captain Stokes cannot therefore be of any very extensive area. Wbatever rain faUs in the south of this northerly dividing range must either be absorbed in the sandy soil, or lie m lagoons, or find its way to the sea by Lake Torrens. The great interior of Australia would seem to be a vast basin of nearly level and arld country, encircled by a ridge of high land wbich separates it from the ocean. To what extent it may hereafter be rendered available for the occupation of civilized man cannot at present be stated. So much of Australia has been condemned at first sight as barren which has been subsequently occupied with profit, that no one can safely depr. - ciate any part of it as altogether usless. Time and exprrience develope uses that at first were never dreamed of. The countrywlihich Mr. Gregory has sighted, but left untrodden, may yet be made to render service. The rrsults of Mr. Gregory's expedition do not appear much to favour the idea that has been so popular in England lately of planting a convict colony in the Gulf of Carpentarla. If the inland country had been of a more pre.
sing character the chances of establishing a flourishing colony to the north -would have been greater; but it would seenm as if only a strip of land along the coast were available, and that in a cimate too hot for the cultivation of cereals or the growth of wool. There is therefore but little in the locality that adapts it to the purposes of a penal settlement. The north-west coast, if explored, might po.. sibly be found to offer greater inducements."

When the caus, was heard by the Vice-Chancellor eight counsel ranaaed among them, with the aid of two directors, to consume nine days, and if the learned gentlemen who appear upon the ap. peal (only a detachment of the whole forensic force enlisted in the litigation) continue their efforts at the same ratio of speed as the hearing up to this time has evidenced, the LordJustices wil have no reason to say that in this particular any disrespect has been shown to them. The case relates to the formation, mismanagement, and failure of the " General Benefit Life Assurance and Loan Society," which commnenced business in 1820 and broke up in 1854, after the secretary had absconded with 11,000l. belonging to the company. TheVice.Chancellor directed inquiries to be made, but reserved the costs. The plaintiff appealed, apparently chiefly on the ground that the costs ought to have been given ini his favour uP to the hearing and not he reserved, though in form the appeal is Presented alleging that further and other accounts should have beer, directed.

'This was a suit for divorce, by reason of adultery, promoted by Mr. llexander Campbell against his wife. The parties were married at Sydney in June, 1842, thore being six children the issue of the marriage. In 1855 it was mutually agreed between them to come to England with their children, and on their return to leave the four eldest here in order to finish their education. Circumstances rendered it necessary that he should postpone his departure, but Mrs. Campbell and the children left Sydnev in December, 1855, and he followed theoi a few months afterwards. In the libel given in by Mr. Campbell it was pleaded that his wifo formed an improper intimacy with one of the passengers, with whom, after their arrival, she carried on an adulterous intorcourse. Mr. Campbell reached London on the 27th of May, and imiediately joined his wife, but on discovering what had occurred withdrew from cohabitation. Mrs. Campbell, in ber defence, relied upon condonation, alleged to hsxe taken place subsequently to the disclosures made to Mr.

SPRING ASSIZRS.
NORTHERN CIRCUIT.
YORK. MAtRcn 19.
CRowVN CocRT.-(Bcforc Olr. Justice CROMPTON.)
George Bell, 40, was indicted for attempting, on tho 14th of April, 1856, to admiuistor to one Thomas Bell two drachms of prussio acid, with intent to kill and murder him.
Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. Price conducted tho prosecution ; Mr. W. Digby Seymour and .Ir. L. 11. Bayley were counsel for the prLhoner,
'Mr. P1s(i;RIN(; briefly stated the leadjng facts of the case. The prosecutor was a farmer, residing at a village called Grindall, a few miles from Bridlington, in the East Riding. The prisoner was his brother, al d up to May, 1856, had resided at a farm called Fiuley-bill, about a mile from Grindall. The case against him was that in April 1856, he had put some prussic acid into a bottle of sherry, and sent it by railway to Grindall for his brother to take. Fortunately, however, his suspicions were arouised, anid in consequence of the peculiar smell of the liquid when poured out into a tumbler, he merely tasted a little, and then spat it out. It would be asked, wvhat motive could the prisoner have to attempt such a crime as the one eharged against him ? Thomas Bell, the prosecutor, was in polsession of some landed property under his father's will; he was married, and if he died witlhout issue that property would go to the prisoner for his life.
After this outline the following witnesses. vere called: - Mr. Thomas Bell.-I am a farmer at Gruidall. The urisoner is my brother. Early in 1S513 he resid&d a.t ul Fey. hill. I am in possession of a farmu at Argamn. I ain the younger brother, and am niarried, but have no family. I have been married nearly four years. On the 19th of April last I received a hamper from Fanny Wilkinson, my servant. It containied a stone bottle about half-full of liquid. Wilkinson poured part of the liquid into a tisumbler. I snielt of it. It hld a very indifferent swell. I afterwards tasted it. I spit it out. I handed it to her. She tasted it, and spit it out. In half an hour or anl hour after she had tasted it she becanie ill. She trembled all ovcr. I gave her svsie branidy. She burst wind from her stouliacli and then canie out in a sweat. The following niiorniiig all our heads e;ied. On the 21st I took the hamper and bottle to Bridmgton and gave them to Mr. Hutchinson, surgeon. I saw a direction on the hamper.
Cross-examined.-I do not know the handwriting of the direction. The cork was sealed with black sealingwax. It appeared to be done with the thumisb, or in some such careless manner. It appeared to be done by somne personi in haste. I believe there was no impression on the wax. The bottle was not locked up in any ctipboard on the 20th. I once received a bottle of chamnpagne. My wife was daughter of Mr. Sharp, of Lincoln. He is a plumnber and glazier. He has a gootd sized famnily. I did not get much with my wife. I have two sisters liUing. My wife is not on the best of terms with my sisters since this happened. My sisters were not present at my . edding. There might have been trifling differences between mv sisters and my wife. On February 15, 18.50, I lent my brothier 1001. without security. Previously to that I had lent hin moniev in a similar wa. My conduct to him was friendly. I saw him in March, 1850, at Mr. Wilson's, my brotlier-in-law, at Sherbourne. I saw him every now and then, aud spoke to him. We spoke as one brother would to another. He has been married 14 years. TIe and his wife have resided together. They have four children. The eldest is turned 13. lIe lias been living with mne snce September last. Probably the prisoner was in difficulties when this happened. 1 believe one creditor was pressing him, He left the East Riding on the 4th of May. I heard of his return in thc following August.
tr. WVilson told me the prisoner had taken a shop at Wakefield. I know Jacob Tranmaer. He was in my service several years. He went from me to the prisoner's service at Martinmas, 1855. Occasionally towards the latter part of his service he got drunk. I have seen him very drunm Perhaps once a week, or perhaps once a month. I have reprimanded him. I believe my *vife has, in my presence, blasiied 1im for getting drunk. I know Chapman. le was my foreman when Tranmaer was there. He was summoned before the magistrates. I may have' charged Tranmaer with swearing falsely, but I do not recollect. Probabl;y Imay have told him he perjured hirnself.
Re-exammied.-My father died in 1852. I married in Mlarch, 1853. My brother has been in the habit of coming to my house now and then.
To the JuDGu.-I have drunk wine with the prisoner. He had sherry and other wine in his house when I drank it there.
Fanny Wilkinson, the prosecutor's servant, stated, she had received the basket fromn the Grindall carrier on the 12th, and confirmed the evidence of Thomas Bell as to tasting the liquor taken from the bottle, and the effects produceed.
Jacob Tranmaer examined.-Lived with the prisoner as shepherd from Martinmas, 1855, to May-day, 1856. On a Sunday night in April, 1856, he took a bamper to the Hin. manby station. The prisoner gave it to hini. Could not sNvear the hamper produced in court Wa1S the same he took. Could not say what size it was. There was a direction on it. He gave it him late at night in the stackyard. Told him to take a horse. Took it and left it under the shed at the Elunmanby station. The shed was where the passengers stand. Could not say whether he put it under a seat or on the ground. When ho got home the prisoner was up, and asked him if lie had taken it. E£e told him he had. Saw no one else but his master. It wasdark when he went aod came back. The witness then 5tated other conversations with the pri. soner, in one of which the prisoner had said that Tranmaer was not to say lie had got anything for him, as it would be a bad job. In another the prisoner had offered Tranmaaer to give him 50. or 1001. to say that he, Tranmaer, had sent sonsething. Hle then stated that by the prisoner's orders he had been to Bridlington in April last, and got the ostler at the Globe Inn to procure half-a-gallon of gin at Mrs. Kay's, which he had done, his master having told him to send the ostler, and not to tell him who it was for. He brought the gin in a stone bottle, with the word " Kay" on it. It was throwirg about the sheep-pens for awhile without a cork. At the same time he got the gin he got two bottles of wine from Mr. Cape, wine-merchant, for the prisoner. He paid for them and got the wine. Hle was not to say who it was for. The wme was put into a straw-stack by the master. On the afternoon of the Sunday he took the hamper to the station. The prisoner came with the stone bottle, and said he wanted him to help him seal it. That was in the pens. The prisoner sealed it.
Cross-examined.-On the 1st of May saw Mr. Hodgson attorney for the prosecution, at Great Driilield. Was a good bit in his company. Saw him several times before giving Iiis evidence before the magistrates on the 2d and 6th of March inst. First told about the bottles since lie came toYork. Did net tell them about it at Driffield that he knew of. The pens are undeneath the shed. The shed is in the stackyard. The stackyard is close to the public road. The shed is open to the front. Took the horse he rode out of the stable. Could not say how many horses the prisoner had Would not swear whether the horse he rode was a horse or a mare. Did not know its colour. Never left anything before without telling the station-master. Never left parcels there before. Never saw a reward of 501. offered till he was at Driffield. Mr. Hodgson spoke to lhim at D-iffield about the 501. EHad been charged with sending the bottle himself. Different people had said so in badness when they had been in drink. Had been lined for being drunk a year ago. That was not the first time. Had been charged by many persons with poaching. No one ever saw him. Might haye had a snare in his pocket. Believed he had been accused of taking a false oath, but not before a magistrate. Recollected Chapman being brought up on a charge of poaching. Went and gave evidence on his behalf. The prosecutor said they had said he had sworn falsely. He told the witness he had spolen falsely. Was called to prove that he had left Chapman in bed, and had found him there when he returned from the field. Could not swear whether be said he was in bed all the time. Chapman was fined. Had becn drunk in the prosecutor's service. His wife once scolded him for being drunk. Could not swear the stone bottle produced in court was the same colour as the one he took. Did not think it was the same colour. Had often seen stone jars like that. They keep stone bottles like that for sheepwash in farmhouses.
Re-examined.-A person coming up the road could see into the pen. Took no notice of the colour of the bottle he brought from Bridlington.
To the JUDGE.-Found the bottle at the pens. The prisoner wanted him to seal the bottle. Would not, because he thought he could seal it himself. Did not tell about the pens to the magistrates, because he did not want to do harm to any one. There was no fire in the pens. Prisoner, he believed, struck a match. Saw him strike a match, or something, hethought.
This witness gave his evidence with a considerable degree of hesitation.
The next four witnesses proved that a basket somewhat siniilar to the one produced in court was found on the morning of Monday, the 14th of April, 1856, lying in the shed at the Hunmauby station ; that it was forwarded by the 12-10 train on that day to Bridlington, where it remaimned in the booking-office, to which the railway clerkcs and passengers had access, until the following Saturday, when it was delivered by a boy having charge of the parcels department to the ostler at the Globe Inn, who gave it to the Grindall carrier.
None of these witnesses spoke with any certainty as to the size, colour, or shape of the basket which thus passed
through their hands.l
Thomas Southwick, police-officer, exa-miuied.-On the lst of May called with a warrant oin the prisoner at his own house, about midnight. The prisoner got away from him after hearing the warrant read, while the witness had left thes bedroom to allow the prisoner's wife to put her clothes on.
Thomas Hodgson.-Now occupied the prisoner's farm at Finley-hiL On Sunday, the 4th of Mlay, saw him there.
Went with him to Liverpool. Started in the prisoner's own gig. Left him on board a ship bound for America. It saied en the Gth.
Cross-examined.-The prisoner was not disguised. His foreman ad the girl saw us leave. I heard about a week before of his having made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors.
John Lazenby, police officer at Bridlington.H-Iad made inquiries to trace whether the prisoner had purchased prussic acid. Had for that purpose searched at York, Driffield, Scarborough, Bdidlingwon and other towns. Had not succeeded in tracing to the prisoner the purchase of any.
William Smith examined,-Is a chymist and druggist at 3ridlington. 'LWprisoner came to his sho in Marsh list year. Broulght some medicine bottles with him. esi
II Fill them with prussiC acid." Replied, Ionsenseasi Bell; yout are joig; yout do nob want th the bottles with something else.
Cross examined.-The psoner ls often been at myyshop. He deals with me. He was not in the habit of seiling any prussie acid stnless ordered by a medical man.
N atnais Sharp examined.-In April, 1856, went over to Crindail. Had heard about the poisoning before leavin
I,incoln. Was at Grindall the InstSaturday in April Sent I or the prisoner to the proseeutor's aose. He ame. Had
snoe conversation about the poisoning, i the ourseof Na hich the witness said that the prisoner had poisoned some
dogs vwith prusaic acid. The prisoner &sid he had gone through his examination, and they could not fid him guilty. Witness repHed, he would have a different sort of gentiemen to examine him from his own friends. The prisoner's son was in the room part of the time. No one else was there.
Cross- examined.-Was the father of the prosecutor's iife. Was not before the magistrates either on the 2d or 6th of Marob, 1857. Was sent for about a week ago from Lincoln since these assizes had commenced. Was told there Were three dogs poisoned with prussic acid. Named it to the prisoner. He did not deny it. Knew the dogs were found poisoned close to his house.
Richard Fox examined.-Is a butcher at Bridlington. At the latter end of August last he went to see the prisoner at Sewerby. They had a conversation about America. N ever mentioned a word to him about this matter. Two or
hree days after that he saw him again, and drove him 'o see his relatives. Had no conversation at that time about this affair. He was then living with his wife and family in ttnhe house of Mr. lHodgson, who had been called as a
Joseph Young examined.-Is superintedlent of police at Great Driffield. In January last a warrant was put into his hand. On the 25th of February he apprehended the prisoner.
Cross examined. Arrested him, and he went along quietly. Apprehended him at Wa'aefield. He was living there in a house. Believed his wife was there. Made inquiries, and was told lie had taken the house.
The original will of Richard Bell, father of the prosecutor and prisoner, was then produced. Fronm it, and from the evidence of Reuben Milner, one of the attesting witnesses, it appeared that the testator had 300 acres of land in the parish of Argam, near Grindall. By the will that was devisea to the younger son (the prosecutor) for life, with remainder to his heirs male successively in strict settlement; in default of such issne to the eldest brotker, the prisoner, for his life,with remainder to his heirs male in like mannerand in default of such issue to the son and chiildren of Mr., Wilson, who had married one of the prosecutor's sisters. The testator also bequeathed 1,0001. each to She prisoner and his two sisters, and several legacies of 100f. each to the prisoner's children and other grandchildren of the deceased.
Thomas Cape, wine-merchant, of Bridlington, and his 'Wife were next examined, and proved that there was an
entry in their books of the sale of two bottles of sherry wine 1 on the Ist of April, on account of Mr. Bell, Finley-hill, in the handwriting of Mrs. Cape, which enabled them distinctly to state they were not paid for. If paid for there would have been no entry.
Dr. Hutchinson, Dr. Allison of Bridlingron, and Mr. Proctor of York were examined, and proved they had tested the liquor contained i the bottle delivered on the 21st of April by the proseutor to Dr. Hutebinson, and that on applying each OfAHehe iron, nitrate of silver, and sulphur tests, they had atisfied themselves of the presence of prussic acid. They injected a portion of the liquor into a cat and two rabbits. The cat died in about 15 seconds; one rabbit in about 15 seconds; the other, an old one, in 4.5 seconds. Afterwards three ounces of pure sherry were given to a cat, but it was none the worse. They had no doubt whatever that the liquor contained prussic acid.
Dr. Hutchinson, in cross-examiuation, said that the prussic acid sold in shops varies very much in strength, and is sometimes sold for cookery.
This closed the case for the Crown.
Mtr. SEymouR, on behalf of the prisoner, contended that there was no satisfactory evidence that the prisoner had sent the hamper. The whole case rested upon the testimony of Jacob Tranmaer. The most material facts proved by him had never been mentioned by him to any one until after the commencement of these assizes. Without Tran. maer the case for the prosecution failed. Tranmaer admitted lie had been drunk; repeatedly, fined more than once and often reprimanded by the prosecutor and his wvife. He had been charged with perjury by the prosecutor. Was he, therefore, a witness upon whose testimony the jury could safely rely? His whole story was improbable from beginning to end. Then there was a total absence of motive. The brothers were on the most friendly terms. Ill February, 1856, the prosecutor had lent him 1001. without security. Sbarp, the father-in-law, was called to speak to conversations. He was a prejudiced witness, and had only been sent for within the last few days, The application to Smith for prussic acid was ajoke, and as sach Smith had treated it. Every search had been made to prove the purchase of prussic acid by the prisoner in the neighbouring towns and in York, but in vain; nor was any found in his possession or onhispremises. Purchase of the poison under suspicious circumstances and possession of it were the main ingredients in Palmer's and in Dove's cases. They were wanting here. His conduct in escaping was not suspicious. A creditor was pressing him. But bis return to the neighbourhood three months after, visiting his relatives, and taking a house at Wakefield, showed that lie vwas conscious of his innocence. Dnring that time he lived in the house of Mr. Hodgson, who succeeded him in the farm at Finley-hilL Huuman nature revolted at the thought of a man attempting to kill and murder a brother ,with -whom be was on the most friendly terms. Should he forget that, had he not a wife, with whom he had lived 14 years, and four children to remind him of his situation ? After commoeDting on the evidence, the absence of several witnesses, and the unfairness of bringing forward evidence not produced on either of the inquiries before the magistrates. He called upon the jury to doubt the trustworti. ness of Tranmaer's evidence, and to acquit the prisoner.
Mr. Justice CROMPTON summed up in a careful and impartial manner, reading over the whole of Tranmaer's evidence, upon which, he said, the case for the prosecution almost entirely rested. Without they were satisfied as to its entire correctness they ought not to convict the prisoner In some points he was confirmed by the other witnesses; that was important. Much, however, had now been brought forward by him for the first time. He then commented upon the rest of the evidence, reading over the material parts.
The jury retired, and after an absence of an hour, returned with a verdict of Guilty, recommending the prisoner to mercy.
The prosecutor joined in the reeommendation, and did not press for a severe punishment.
The learned JUDGE sentenced the prisoner to be transported for the term of his natural life.
The trial occupied nearly 12 hours, and appeared to excite considerable interest.

KINGSTON. MATRTT 9fA
Mr. Justice Cresswell did not get through the criminal business at Lewes until Thursday afternoon, and at the conclusion of the assizes the young woman Eleanor Jane
larpur, who was convicted of robbing her mistress, Lady Tancred, was brought up for judgment and sentenced to 15 montlhs hard labour. The commission for the county of Surrey was opened on Thursday in this town by Mr. Baron Channell, and to-day business was proceeded with in both courts, Mr. Justice Cresswell presiding on the Civil Side and Mr. Baron Channell in the Crown Court.
There are 22 prisoners for trial, and there are two charges of murder and several other serious cases to be disposed of. On the Civil Side 49 causes are entered, 15 of which are to be tried by special juries. This is a much smaller number than usual at these assizes, which is probably owing to a great many attorneys being engaged in connexion with the general eleti.on, and having consequently not entered their causes for trial.
THE QUEEN V. GEORGE SMITH.
In this case, which was a charge against the defendant, who is a solicitor in London, of having committed wilful and corrupt perjury at the trial of a cause at Guildford last summer assizes in which he was the plaintiff, Mr. Prentis, who appeared for the prosecution, app *ed to his Lordship to enlarge the recognizances of the witnesses to the next assizes. He said that a rule for a new trial had been obtained in the original matter, and the Chief Baron had expressed an opinion that it would be advisable that this trial should take place before any further proceedings upon the criminal charge were taken. He therefore, in consequence of that suggestion, now applied for the sanction of the Court to the witnesses not being required to go before the grand jury at these assizes, and that the case should stand over until the new trial had taken place.
Mr. Baron CHANNELL inquired if the defendant consented to the postponement.
Mr. Smith said he had no objection to the case going over. lIe was about to make a statement of some of the facts, hut
The learned JUDGE said he could not try the case, and all he could say was that he thought, under the circumstances, the matter ought to stand over. He said he thought he might, however, in justice to the defendant also state that it appeared he 'was in attendanee and ready to meet the charge, and that the ease was postponed at the zequest of the prosecution.
The recognisanes3 of the witnesses were then enlarged and the defendant and his sureties renewed their recognisauces, and the matter was ordered to stand over to the summer assizes.
The special jurors, it appears, are only summoned to appear on Wednesday next, but the nature of the business appears to be such that it is doubtful whether there will be sufficient common jury cases to, occupy the Court until that day, and their attendance has therefore been required on Tuesday instead of Wednesday. Those gentlemen who do not receive such notice will probably, notwithstanding, feel it their duty to attend on the earlier day, as their presence might materially expedite the business of the assizes.

CIVIL SIDE.-(Before Lord CAMPBELL aud a Common=
Ju-rJ.)
COBBRI v. TuRnsm.
This was an action for breach of promise of marriage, to which the defendant had pleaded that he made the promise when he was in such a state of drunkenness as not to know what he was about.
MIr. Brewer and Mr. Beasley conducted the plaintiffs case, and Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Field the defend. ant's.
The defendant is the son of an attorney in Yorkshire, and IS in partnership with a Mr. Mason as a millowner at Mayfield in this county, and the plaintiffs father was, from November, 1856, to the month of February last, the manager of Mason and Tmrner's mill, in which the plaintiff herself was employed as a winder, and also her two brothers. It appeared that the defendant, who was about 23 years old, soon after the family of the Corries came to hlayfield began to pay great attention to the plaintiff, and, having frequently visited at the father's house, expressly asked and obtained his consent to their marriage on the 29th of December, whereupon the defendant said he should see about the settlement immediately, and he did accordingly in a few days go to a solicitor named Welsbh, at Ash. bourne, and gave instructions for the preparation of the
settlement. The fair jfancde and her brother met tho defendant at Ashbourne on that day, and she expressed some reluctance to the match on the ground of disparity of condition; but the defendant was tey eager that the marriage should take place forthWU, and she therefore gave her consent. The settlement was prepared and executed; and by the terms of that instrument the defendant's property, which consisted of 1,3001. in the business, wvas ettled upon the plaintiff and her issue, and in case of failure of issue upon her brothers and sisters. On the 24th of January another visit was paid to Ashbourne by the defendant, the plaintiff, and her brother, and on that occasion thd defendant bought at a jeweller's two wedding 2ings, from which he requested the plaintiff to chdose one; and he had previously made her a
resent of a gold watch and chain, which c st 101., and he ad given her brother a silver watch. Between the plaintiffs brother and the defendant the intimacy was very great. Indeed, for some time theylived together in a small cottage. It was suggested in cross-examination that this was done for the purpose of taking care of the defendant, and,because ho was afraid to be left alone ; but the brother denied that that was the ease. He also denied -that the defendant and he were constantly drinking together at publichouses, and that the defendant was frequently drunk, but admittedthat he had seen him so twice in his own cottage. He also denied that the defendant used to keep his bed nearly all day, but stated that he seldom came to the mill
as he knew nothing about the business. He acknowledged that he had heard something said about the engagement being kenDt secret from Mr. 1Mason, and it appeared that by the parinership articles Mr. Mason would have the power of dissolving it if the defendant executed any assignment of his property. The affair, however, went on up to the last moment. The wedding day was fixed for the ath of February, and on the 4th the defendant went for the license; but, the vicarnot being at home, he could not get it that day, and it became necessary to put it off to the 7th of February. But before that day came M-r. Mason had heard about it, and the defendant's father came over and broke offthe match. The defendant himself said to the brother, "The governor is come, and there'll be a - of a row to-night," and he afterwards wrote a letter to the plaintiff, telling her that the match must be off on account of the misery it would bring upon his family.
Mr. MACAULAY admitted that the plea could not be proved, but addressed the jury in mitigation of damages.
The learned JUDGE, in summing up, said that he had never in the course of his experience met with anything so preposterous as the defence put upon the record, because the defendant had repeated the promise over and over again in the most deliberate manner; and the plea set up that upon All those occasions, when he asked the father's consent, when he gave instructions for and when he executed the settlement, when he bought the wedding ring, and when he applied for the marriage license, he was so drunk that he did not know what he was about. The jury were therefore bound to give the plaintiff a fair and reasonable compensation. There had been nothing improper at all in her conduct, and if the defendant was a person of dissolute
abits a marrage with a well-behaved, respectable young woman might probably have led to his reformation.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.-Daamages,

This was an action against the Butterley Iron Company for an injury sustained by the female plaintiff owing tothe neglect of the defendants proprly to fence off a railway cutting belonging to them at Urich. It appeared that Mrs. Witham, whose husband kept a school and also a druggist's sho~ at Crich, was returning home after dark one evening in November, 1S55, when she fell into the cutting in question and sustained the most serious injuries. Her head was cut, her spine injured, and for several months she was in immninent danger from a concussion of the brain. She had partly recovered since, but in the opinion of her medical attendant she was not likely ever to get quite well again. Before the accident she had been a woman of great activity and intelligence, and bad managed almost entirely the druggist's shop. She could now do very little; if she attempted accounts her memory failed her, and if she endeavoured to lift a weight it would drop from her hand. The cutting in question was separated from the public carriage road by a strip of waste land, over which the foot passengers frequently walked by day ; and there was a trodden footpath close to the edge of
te cutting. MIrs. Witham had no recollection of how the accident na pened; but she supposed that sh:e turned in a direction to go over a bridge too soon, and so walked into
he open cutting, which was nearly nine feet deep where
Mr. MACArLAY, for the defendants, contended that, as there was the strip of waste land between the cutting and the roadway, there was no obligation upon the defendants to fence off their cutting.
The learned JUDGE held that there was, if the jiLry sbo ld find that the cutting unfenced was dangerous to passengers nsing the road with ordinary care. iMe would,
owever, reserve to the defendants leave to move the Court above upon that question.
Mr. MACAULAc. Y then addressed the jury; and, the learned JUDGE having summed up, the jury retired to consider their verdict, which, after some deliberation, they found for the plimntiff.-Damages 2001.

John Brown and Thomas Hockins were indicted for a burglary in the dweDinghouse of John Wiliam Joy, at Kingskerswell, on the 29th of November.
Mr. Houldsworth was counsel for the prosecution.
The prosecutor, a farmer, who had been in Australia locked up his house at 10 o'clock at night, when all the family went to bed. Abut a quarter to 2 o'clock in the morning he heard some men walking about in his front garden, and shortly afterwards he heard a.pane of glass broken. His wife wished him to get up, but he said he would let them got into the house first* presently he heard another pane of glass broken. He then thought it was time to get up. He got out of bed, took his double bar. relled gun, and went out of doors. He found the glams of the pantry window broken, but he could not see any one. He then called and told them to come out, Hockins then made his appearance. The prosecutor told him to tell his name or he -would shoot him, and, as he was silent, he fired at his legs. He then -ran roundc the othner side of his house and saw another man, and he fired at him. He looked about, and not seeing any one else he went into the house, fastened the windows, loaded his gun, and went to bed. The next imorning one of his men brought him two baskets, which he had found in the garden. They contained some things which had been stolen from the house. Information was given to the police, and, on the 27th of December, Hockins was apprehended. His leg was examined and several shot marks were discovered on his leg. His trousers had been much shot.
Bray, an accomplice, said that Brown got into the house and handed th things out. When the gun was fired he got into a laurel hedge. He remained there till all was quiet. They thought Mr. Joy had a good deal of money, as he had only lately come from Ausrlia. He (Bray) had been trans. ported for 10 years, in 1849, for a burglary.
The JUDGE told the jury they must acquit Brown, as there was no evidence to corroborate the accomplice.
The jury Acquitted Brown, and Conticted Hockin, and he was sentenced to be kept to penal servitude for six years.
Bray was then put to the bar to be sentenced, he having Eleaded guilty- to another burglary and another offence, he aving been before convicted of felony. He was a ticket. of-leave man. He was now sentenced to six years' penal servituade.
William Hancock was indicted for the maanslaughter of Eizabeth Hancock, his wife.
Mr. Carter prosecuted, and Mr. Cole defended the prisoner.
It appeared that the prisoner was much given to drink. He came home one evening very drunk. He was heard to use violent language, and in the night a moaning was heard. Early in the morning the prisoner ran out of the house and said his wife was dead. The neighbours went in and found her dead, but the body was stll warm, and an infant was lying on her breast. A post mortem examination was made and there were appearances on the head which induced the surgeons to open the he, and it was found that a wouncd had been inflicted some months before, and there was fansu and an abscess on the brain, which caused her death. Thes prisoner had thrown a cup at his wife anad struck her on the head, which had preduced the internal injuries. This had taken place in July or August. There -was a. hole completely through the bone of the skull, through which hole the fungus was growing dprotrudign The skull was a quarter of an inch thick where the bo% was.
In cross-examination the surgeon said he thought it improbable that a round teacup could have produced such a wound; he thought it must have been caused by an angular instrument - but for the external wound he should have attributed iedeathtot natural causes. If the ap brokae on coming against the head the wound might have been produced by the part broken.
When before the coroner the prisoner said his wife had been long sUffering from her head. On the evening before her death they went to bed without any quarrelinge; in the night his wife complained of being thirsty; begot up, lighted a fire, and made her acme tea- she drank two cTus she coipmained of cold, and he wrapped up her feet and essed himself, and went downstairs; he afterwards caleed to her froma below, but ha In no answer he wenit up, and found his wife dead, with the infant at her breast.

The prisoner and his wife had gone to bed at niight without any quarrel, And everything went to show that the prisoner had b)een most kidnd to her during the night ; but they were called upon now to conivict the prisoner of this offence upon mnedica speculative evidence, assisted by a statement made by the prisoner when the case was before the coroner. He then) contended that it 'was not probable that the -wound could have been inflicted by a round teacup.

WARD V. HARRIS.
MIr. Kingdon and MIr. Bere were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Colier and Mr. Cole for the defendant.
This was an action to recover damages for libel contained in a letter which the defendant had written of and concerning the plaintiff. The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded a justification. It appeared that the plaintiff had ivedas footman with the defendant, who was a clergyman residing near Chard, in Somersetshire. The plaintiff went into the service of the defendant in November, 1855. The wages were 201. a-year, with clothes. On the 10th of October, 1856, the plaintiff asked the defendant to raise his waged, but as he refused to do so the pbiintiff gave a month's warning. Upto tbat time nothing vas said against the plaintiff; but subsequently to the warning being given eome d'ssaue took place about the clothes being sent to be washed Dy a washerwoman named Harber. Mrs. Harris requested the plaintiffnot to send his clothes to be washed by
els. BIarber, who had been in the habit of washing for the dOefenndant'sfamily. The plaintiff said he should continue
tosend s clothes to Harber to be washed. krs. Harris said, " It's very mach for a servant to do what his master an mistress request him not to do." The plaintiff rephetd, "I beg yourpardon, Madam ; if you vilL pay for moy washing von may send my clothes where you please, but i ave to pay for it I must send it where I can havo it done cheapest." Mrs. Harris then asked him who had brough hoelis clothes. The plaintiff said he should not tell her. Mrs. Harris then said, "We will serve you out for this when you apply for a character." The plaintiff afterwards delvered up the plate, &c., and left the service. He then applied tO Archdeacon Bartholomew for a place, and that gentleman wrote to the defendant, asking him if the plaintiff was honest, sober, good tempered, willing, and understood hiswork. The defendantreplied that he under. stood his work tolerably'well, but was t.tally deficient in all the qualities he named in his letter. Mr. Bartholomew, upon receiving this letter, declined to take the plaintiff into his service, and the action was therefore bronght.
The plaintiff, in cross-examination, adnuitted that upon one occasion he had been intoxicated; that as he was driving home his hat fell off, and that he had the " hiccups" during the time he was waiting at table, and was ordered out of the room. Upon another occasion, when the defendant had a large party, the defendant told the plaintiff to brig in some negus, but the defendant told the lady's-rmaid to s.nke the negus. The plaintiff then called the defendant out of the room and told him he did not come there to have the lady's-maid made a butler, and that if he did not make the negus he should not take it in. The def.ndant then called for another man-servant to take it in, but he was not to be found. He then caUed for another gentlems an's servant, but he was absent, and eventually the plaintiff took in the negus, but in tumblers, instead of wine-glasses. The plaintiff broke a plate that night, but it was by accident. 1B. Harris had complained of the plaintiff being absent at prayers. In April, 1856, the defendant gave the plaintiff notice to leave in consequence of his speaking to another gentleman about his going into his service. ,Mr. or Mrs. Jiarris had said they would give him the character he deserved. The plaintiff considered it was no business of MIrs. Harris's as to the person who brought home his clothes, bat he was not impertinent or insolent. Had sold an old great coat for 3e., as it was customary for servants to do so when they had their new livery.
The CmxFi Jusric said he considered the plea of justification was at an end, and the question would be as to the bona fidcs, whether the jury believed that the defendant made this communication in a sincere belief that it was trune.
Mr. COLL said he should contend that it was a privileged commanication.
The CHiEF Jusnac-Yes, but it mnst be honest. The case then proceeded.
Mr. CoLLIE addressed the jury for the defendant, and urged upon them that a gentleman in the situation of Mr. Barms was in a most embarrassing and painful position. On the one hand, if he gave a character of the servant which was likely to prevent him from obtaining employment he was open to an action; and, on the other hand, he had a duty to perform to the gentleman, who took the servant; and he was afraid in the majority of cases the latter duty was hardly properly considered. The real question, then, would be whether there was any malice on the part of the defendant. It could not be supposed that this clergyman entertained any malice towards this plaintiffHe apprehended that they would consider MIr. Harris had some reason of complaint. The man had got drunk within a fortnignt of his entering upon the service, and certainly it was no pleasant thing to have your footman when you had a party refusing to take in -the negus. It would bave been better if Mr. Harris had discharged him upon one of those occasions, and it was his kindness which had led him into this difficulty. Let the jury look at what the plaintiff stated had been said by Mrs. Harris; it would not be expected that she eould have used the words " We will serve you out." It was not the language of a person of edaucation, but it was just what John would say. Mr. Harris had given the character which he thought he was boand to give, although he could not prove every circumstance. He had given that which was the impression on his mind. Mr. Harris had thought the taking the greatcoat was an act of dishonesty, and, as the man had been drunk on one occasion, he could not say lie was a sober man. It was absurd to say that Mr. Harris had been actuated by malice.
Mr. Harris stated that the greatcoat he had given to the plaintiff had belonged to a former servant, and he told the plaintiff that he would lend it him until his new clothes were made. Nothing was said to induce him to beheve that it was a gift. On the occasion of the plaintiff being intoxicated he dropped his hat twice into the carriage. When he was waiting at table on the arrival at hon' he was so much intoxicated that he was ordered out of the room, and another servant was obliged to remove the things. The next day he expressed contrition, and was forgiven. Upon one occasion on a Sunday evening he refused to come in to prayers. When he was leaving the service the plaintiff asked for a written character, but defendant told hinm he never gave a character in that manner, but if any gentleman apphedhto him he would give the eharacter he deserved. W hen defendant asked him for the old greateoat he told hinm he had sold it, as he thought he had a right to it. After the plaintiff had qguitted the service he wrote to the defendant, expressing his sorrow for his misconduct during the time he was in his service, and begging to be forgiven Never said tothe plaintiff that they would serve him out when he applied for a character. Mrs. Harris said his con. duct should be known. Never had 40 servants in the course of a year. On aumount of one act of intoxication he couald not call the man a sober man.
The learned counsel having addressed the jury for their respective clients,
The10RD CUM,TU JST'ICr summed up. This was a very important ease to both parties. No doubt the letter had been very injurious to the plaintiff, whose livelihood dependedaupon hisecharacter. On the other hand, the defendant was entitled to their consideration, for he said that as a master called upon to give the character of a servant to another person who was about to take him into his service he had a solemn and most important duty to discharge,- a duty he owed to society at large, and more espe cially to the person who made the application in perfect confidence of receiving a truthful ;nswer. If a master gave a character of a servant ander a due sense of his obligation to state that which he believed in his mind to be the truth, and made his statement aecordingly, he was jastilled. Then the defendan had gone a great length in saying he was totaly deficient as to sobriety when he had only been drunk once in 11 months, and that he was totaly deficient as to honesty because he had sold that old coat. With regard to his good temper, and wiUingness to do his work, the plaintiff certainly had shown that which might justify the master in not giving him a good character upon those two points. Whether this was a privileged communication wcaid depend upon two poInts-first, the occasion must be one which the law treated as privileged, and then the prt making the statement must make it honestly and bon= with a sincere and conscientious belief that what he was stating was the truth. There could be no douht that in the present case the occasion was privileged, and the question therefore was whether the defendant had acted bondfidc, If they found for the plaintif they would give him such damages as they thought himnfairly entitled to.
The ry returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Da-

Mr. Keating, Q.C., and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. M'Mahon for the defendants.
The plaintiffs in this action were Messrs. Schneider and Co., the proprietors of certain mines of iron ore at UlverFtone, in North Lancashire. The defendants, Messrs. W. 0. Forster and G. and J. Barker, were the great ironmasters at Wolverhampton, carrying on business under the style of the ChilHngton Company. The action was brought to recover the sum of 63. 17s. 6d., being the balance of an account due from the defendants to the plaintiffs for a large quantity of iron ore sold and delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendants in the year 1856. It appeared that on the 4th of March, 1856, the plaintiffs had entered into a contrae with the defendants for the sale of 2,000 tons of the plaintiff' " best blast furnace ore," at the rate of 23s. a-ton. The questions now raised were whether the ore supplied was of the description epecified, or whether, as alleged by the defendants, it contained an unusual quantity of clay, earthy matter, and pebbles. The plaintiffs admitted that the defendants were entitled to a deduction of is. a ton upon about 120 tons; but the defendants claimed a deduction of 2s. 6d. a-ton, and upon a larger quantity.

It appeared that the prisoner, who was a widow, had been suspected by her friends to be in the familyway some time before tho 4th of October last, when sbe suddenly quitted home, and, presenting herself at the union gained admission. On the next day abe was delivered of a healthy male child, and on the 17th, to the great surprise of the matron, she expressed her intention to quit and take her child with her, notwithstanding that the day was bitterly cold and wet. Finding that she was bent on this step the matron wrapped up theinfant as well as she could, and the prsoner took her a rertc with him under her shawl about 9 or 10 'clock. A.t 11 of the same day she was seen to go into a turnip-field, through which was a
public path, bearing what appeared to be a baby in her arms, ndn in a short time she was noticed to return from the field without, the child. At that time the weather was most in. clement, but at 2 o'clock itclearcd up; and, at 4o'clock, as a ILan was walking along the path,. he hwd a cry just as if a hare had been caugbt min a nrnge, and huntinog among the high turni h vere net a hare, but a baby, wrapped up, indeed, but sti2l exposed to the weather, and cryiDg bitterly and faintly. The constable, who lived hard by, was soon on the spot, and the two men then took the helpless creature to a doctor, who expressed the opinion today that had the poor thing remained out half-an-hour longer life would have been extinct, its lungs and heart being then affected by congestion, superindured by the long exposure and want of nourishment.
At the close of the case for the prosecution,
Mr. Justiee EP.LE expressed great doubt whether the acts of the mother, inhuman and heartless thdugh they must be admitted to be, constituted such an infliction of bodUy injury as was contemplated by the statute-the 1st of Victoria, chap. 85, sec. 2-under which the indictment was framed, which he thought contemplated tho infliction of some wound and visible injury ou the person.

Mr. Abrahiam Levy, furrier, of No. 1, Sandys-row, Bishopsgato-street, said-Yesterday afternoon I went to the London Tavern, for the purpose of hearing Lord John Russell's speech, and while listening to the proceedings I felt a tug at my pocket, and immediately missed miy watch, vihich I found had been wrenched from the guard. I accused the prisoner, who had been for some time standing at my side, of having stolen it, and seized him by the arm. Directly afterwards the watch was found at his feet.

I followed him a short distance, when I stopped him and told him that I was a police officer, and that 1? Should take him into custody on suspicion of having some of his master's property in his possession. He said he had not got any. I took him to the station-house, and as I was about to search him he put his hand into his trousers pocket and said, "I rll take out what I've got." He then took from his pocket a number of martin sable tails, which he gave me, saying that that was all he had got. I put my right hand into his trousers pocket, and took out some more. I also found some in his coat pocket, making altogether 51 tails. I proceeded to his lodgings with the prosecutor's foreman, and in a drawer in a bedroom I found one tail and four minx skins. When I returned to the station-house I told the prisoner I had founlnd those skins, and he said they had come from the

After the prisoner left I examined the same bundles, and found the correct nimber of skins, but about 50 of them were deficient of tails. The tails produced correspond with those I missed.

in. his hand.
The officer said he also found upon the prisoner a pocketboook, in which was written " A New-year's Gift from E. M. to 0. P.," and a betting-book.
Alderman CorEXLAxD remarked that the betting-book contained the latest betting upon the Warwick race and the Derby, and asked the pnsoner from whose pocket he had taken them, and why he had refused his address.
The prisoner, who pretended to be very deaf, said the betting-book was not his. He bought the pocketbook of a young man he knew. He did not wish to give his address, because all the lodgers of the house would be calling him a pickpocket, although his character would bear investigation. He did not steal the handkerchief ; the fact was he saw two boys pick the prosecutor's pocket and drop the handkerchief, and he picked it up.
The prosecutor said the prisoner was waldng off whith It when he stopped him.
The prisoner was remanded till Tuesday, in the hope that the publicity the case might obtain throug.h the press would be tbhe means of flndingh the owners of the pocketbook
BOwv-SrR~XX.-Joeeph Petit, the foreigner who was remnanded from last week on a series of charges of robbing hotels, was brought up for final examination.
It appears that in consequence of the numerous robberies of which the police had information they had communicated with the proprietors of such hotels as it was thonght were likely to be next visited. Mr. Thomas, the proprietor of Stevens's Hotel, was one of those who bad received such an intimation, and, although it was not the custom of the house to admit strangers without satisfactory references, he gave instructions to his servants that if a person answering this man's description should present himself he was to be adnutted and shown to the room, and a messenger was to be sent to the police station. When the prisoner apphed for a night's lodging he was accordingly shown to a room, but a strict watch was kept on him all the time he remained in the house, and a messenger was sent for Sergeant Gunmner, who ultimately apprehended him.
Of the five 51.-notes found on the prisoner four were identified as forming part of the contents of the desk stolen from the bedroom of Mr. Wodehouse, engineer to the Permanent Way Company, at the Bedford Hotel. A bracelet found in his trunk was also identified as one of the articles stolon from the Exeter-hail Hotel. Some rings and seals were identified by a gentleman from Manchester, who had been robbed at an.hotel there, and who recognized in the prisoner a fellow-lodger. As the prisoner stated (through the interpreter) that e did not Caim these articles, they were given up. Numerous hotel-keepers, who had been robbed in a similar manner, were in attendance. Three charges were selected, and lie was committed for trial.
WORS}UP-STBXBT.-Anne Davis, a well-dressed yonng woman, vas charged with robbing Miss Eleanor Jones.
The prosecutrix stated that she had known the prisoner for several years, but had latterly lost sight of her until the 28th of January, when she accidentally met her in Cheapside, and, as the prisoner then told her that she was involved in great distress, she gave her card with an invitation to visit her, and expressed her anxiety to do what she could to assist her.l In the afternoon of the 4th of February the prisoner called, at the same time that two lady friends of hers also called, and the prisoner having left the house somewhat abruptly, she was induced, from something her servant told her, to examine her bedroom, and then discovered that she had been robbed of a gold watch, two gold chains, two gold rings, and a gold seaL
Ellen Roach, the servant, stated, that having been sent on an errand, which occupied her only about three minutes, she was surprised to find the prisoner, whom she had left in the lower part of the honse, coming downstairs from the bedrooms, her mistress and the Indies being in the parlour. The prisoner said, " As your mistress is now engaged, I will go out and retulrn inhalf an hour," and she did leave the house, but did not return. She presently after missed two of her mistress's rings from the mantelpiece, and, as the prosecutrix: told her she had not removed them, they jointly searched the dressingroom, and then missed the rest of the
roperty. The street door was kept fastened, and no one gut the prisoner could have obtained access to the stolen articles.
Bergeant Smith, of the K division, deposed to having been in almost constant search for the prisoner since the 4th of last month bbutcould find no trace of her till the preceding
veening when he found her at a lodgin-house in Lambethst>reet,wnitechapeL She stoutly doued all knowledge of the robbery, but by diligent inquiries he at length discovered the watch, which had been pledged at the sh of apawn broker in Cannon-street, St. George's-in-the East.
The prisoner was asked if she wished to put any nestions to the witnesses, to which she quietly replied " ot any," and she was committed till that day wee forthe com tion of the evidence. P
THAiss.-William Weaver,&aseaimen's boarding-house. keeper, of No. 50, St. George's-street, better knowvn as Ratcliff-highway, and Thomas Palmer, an elderly man in his employ, appearedabeore Mr. Sxrm to answer summaonwse issued against themn by Mr. E.IL R. Coleman, by order Of the Board of Trade. The summaonses were issued under the 43d section of the 11th and 12th of Victoria, oue of the late Sir John Jervis's Acts, and the 176th section of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and tatstedAthat one James Living. ston, a seaman, did unlawfully and fraudulentlym3ake use of certaincertificate and reports of character and discharge, required and given under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854; to wit, a ce#tificsteoOf the service of one John Puttmakn, a seaman, and a certain report of the conduct, character, and qualifications of the same John
Puttman seaman, neither of which said certificate and reportbelonged to him the Eaid James Livingston, contrary to section 176 of tie said Act, and that the defenQ4nts William Weaver and Thomas Palmer, before the said offence was committed as aforesaid, to wit, on the 4th day of March inst., in the parish of St. George-in-the-East, in the county of Middlesex, did unlawfully and fraudulently aid abet, counel, and procure the said James Livingston to ao and commit the mid offence.
Mr. SELFB said this was undoubtedly a most serious offence, and it could not be too widely known that the Government were determined to prosecute in every case. The merchant service of this country would be materially injured if tho evil were not checked. He thought the extreme punishment was only for extreme cases, and this was not one, but he would inflict a very severe penalty on the head offender. He considered this case was very much like subornation of perjury. He convicted the prisoners, and fined Weavef5OL, and Palmor, who had acted under the orders of his master, lOl. only.
An urgent appeal was made to the magistrate, who reduced the penalty on Weaver to 401., which he paid, and remitted the fine on Palmer, who was then set at liberty.
SOUTW uAR -Mr. COMBE received Bs. in postage stamps for the poor-box of the coart from " W. L."
LArnaTvu-A young fellow who ciave the name of James Dollard, and was dressed in a new palet6r, tbo cloth of which was of the finest texture, was placed at the bar before Mr. NORTON on a charge of picki-ng the pocket of Miss Sarah Meeking, a lady residing in Church-row, Limehouse, of as. 6d. in silver in the Music-hall of the Surrey Gardenson the night before.
From the evidence it appeared that on the evening before the prosecutrix, with her brother and a party of friends, attended a concert gien at the Surrey Gardens Music-haU in aid of the early closing movement, and occupied a seat in the front gallery. In the courso of the performance she felt a hand in her pocket, and, on looking down her dress, observed her purse open and empty. She instantly called to ber brother to secure the prisoner, who stood jubt behind her, and he did so, upon which the prisoner expressed himself highly indignant at being suspected of such an act, assuring Mr. Meeking that he had niade a great mistake. The gentleman, howvever, was not to be thrown off his guard, and the prisoner, observing that he had beckoned to a constable to como to his assistane, offered to go with him. On getting out of the building Mr. Meeking asked him how much mohey he had about him, and his reply was, " A gentleman is not to be supposed to know the exact amount in his pocket to a shilling or two." He was then searched, when half-a-sovereign and 1Gs. were found loose in his pocket, aud among the latter was a floria which, with
he had taken from the prosecutrix's pocket.
Sergeant Coppin said, he had freonently seen the prisonerm company with the memnbers of the swvell mob, and had aiso seen him in custody at Mlarlborough-street police. court, but he could not say whether he had, ever been con-
A solicitor who attended for the prisoner declared he had not- but his client, with more candour, admitted it, and t*at Cook, the gaoler, was right in saying that he had been at this court before on a simnilar charge.
Cook said that this was his decided impression, but he did not like to say so positively, as he had grown considerably, and was dressed so fashionably.
The prisoner admitted that he had been taken by the late Sergeant Quinnear at the Surrey-gardens about two years ago, and sentenced from this court to two months' imprisonment. He alsopleaded " Gnuilty" to robbing Miss Meeking of the contents of her purse.
Mtr. NoRToN, on account of the prisoner's candour, abated one month from the period of imprisonment to which he might have sentenced him, and committed him for five months' hard labour in Wandsworth House of Correction.

R;EPESENTATION OF MANCgESTER.
On Thursday, the 19th, a deputation waited upon the tight Hon. }. Lowe, on behalf of 4,000 electors of Manehesber, requesting hin to allow himself to bo put in nomination for that city. The deputation consisted of Mr. Alderman Neild, Mr. AspinaU Turner, and Mr. Jeremiah Garnett, and they backed their request by an assurance that 16,000. had been already subscribed by the constituency to defray the necessary expenses of a contest with so formidable an organization as the League.
Mr. Lowx expressed his high sense of the honour which had been done him, but felt bound in gratitude to the electors of Kidderminster, from whom he had always re ceived the utmost Idndness and confidence, not to retire from the representation of that borough.
The deputation returned to Manchester yesterday morning to consult the constituency as to the propriety of adopting a requisition to Mr. Massey, Under-Secretary of the Home Department. We believe there is no doubt of their decision, and that Sir J. Potter and Mr. Massey will be nominated in opposition to Mr. Bright and Mr. Milner Gibson, with great prospects of success.
BEvXRLEY.-The return of Mr. Wells and the Hon. W. H. F. Denison, the Liberal candidates, is considered certain, their canvass having been most successfuL Mr. Hastings, who came forward as a Liberal, has retired. Mir. Glover, who was defeated at the last election, is still in the field. Mr. Wells and Mr. Denison have publicly addressed the electors. Mr. WeUs said he thought there were reasons whieh showed that Lord Palmerston did right in supporting the British officers abroad. He would vote for the abolition of church-rates, and for a measure which would extend the suffrage so far as the necessities of the agc required. He believed Lord Palmerston in the next Parliamnent would be bound to propose a comprehensive sgtem of reforms, and he also thought his Lordship would check the centralizing tendency of legis. lation. He would vote for the baUot, and he hoped some measure of national education would be proposed satisfactory to al parties. Mr. Denison said he would support Lord Palmerston's Administration, bat he would not b owthc Government, and would only support them nos the measures proposed were for the good of the country. He lamented the Chinese war, but from his knowledge of the Chinese he was convinced that intercourse with them -would soon have been impossible, unless made aware that the British lion, peaceable in repose, is also terrible when roused. He was anxious for a reform, but did not support the baUot. He would support al measures of army reform, but was opposed to State education. A resolution was passed pledging the meeting to support Mr. Wells and Mr. Denison.
BOLTON.-Captain Gray, upon a requisition from 400 electors, offers himself in opposition to Mr. Barnes and Mr. Crook. The latter gentlemen were to meet the electors publicly last evening.
BLr.csBuaRo .-It is expected there wiU be a severe contest between. 1r. Pilkington and Mr. Jonathan Peel, the Liberal candidates, and Mr. W. H. Hornby, wvho comes forward in the Conservative interest. Each of these gentlemen have separate committees.
BRiDpoRT-Five candidates are already in the field for the honour of representing this borough-viz., Mr. T. A. Mitchell, M.P., and Mr. V. D. IHodgson, as Liberals, and supporters of Lord Palmerston; Mr. W.U. Heygate,Conser. vative,and opposed toLord Palmeraton's Chinese policy; Mr. J. P. Murrough, M.P., also opposed to Lord Palmerston, but favourable to the ballot, extension of the franchise, and abolition of church-rates; and, lastly, Mr. E. T. Smith, lessee of Drury-lane Theatre, and proprietor of the Stulay Times, favourable to Lord Palmerston so far as the Chinese affair is concerned, but desirous of annual Parliaments, the fuUest extenaion of the franchise, vote by balloe, administrative reforn, abolition of church-rates, &c. At present it is believed the contest wiU be between Messrs. Mitchell, Hodgson, and Heygate, but with many unpledged votes the matter is doubtfuL
Bvc KLxGn.IIAI.-A contest has broken out inthis borough, and Sir H. Verney, who formerly represented Buckingham, again offers his services to the electors in opposition to the present Conservative members, the Marquis of Chandoes and General Hall, and with some prospect of success. General Hall bas issued an address soliciting re-election, and affirming his intention to support Lord Paimerston's Go. verument.
BUCseINGHAorTSHIRE.-Despite rumous to the contrary, there is no probability of any opposition to the return of the three members for this county-Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Du Pr6, and the Hon. C. C. Cavendish. In the course of his address Mr. Du Pr6 says:-
In the crisis which has led to an appeal to tSe nation I was acuated by no desire to,isplace a Minist-er whose vigorous adminis, trittonof the war aud whose temperate iewsof progrestlve improvement contrasted favourably with the Government that Preceded him; bat I cordially concurred lu a vote which stigma%ti7ed the late transa-tions in Cbina sa rash and Impolitic. tendi, g to involve us in a sanguinary stragelo, on grounds whOilb inadequate and in violation of the principles of justlce and humanuity. Daring the conflic with Russia, which displayed to conspicuously the heroic valour of our countrymen, my votes were given with a view touphold the gloryof our arms, and to ebtain terms of peace comnnensurate with the sacri6ces so cheerfully submitted to by the people. It wii nowr be my aim to reduce the pressure of taxation to the utmost degree contistent with the due Derformance of the public service and the bonour and safety of the country. In the present divided tate of parties the duties of tndependent members have become unusually difbcult; but I shall endea'our, by looking less to men than to measures, to support a policy which, while residting all ill-considered Innovations, seeks In a true Conservative spirit to amend and improve whatever is defective or decayed, which will maintain inviolate our Protestant institutions, aed promote the intersts of the agricuitural body, to which I have always been unfeignedly attacbed."
BucKINGIIcAN (BoRoUG1n.)-Sir Harry Verney, Bart., of Claydon-house, has appeared in the field to contest this borough on Whig prmdiples, in opposition to the present ouembers, the Marquus of Chandos and General HalL
CARLISLsc.-Since the meeting at which Sir James Graham made his exeplanations Mr. Perronet Thompson, the candidate proposed at a previous Liberal meeting, in company with M,. Ferguson, has been withdrawn, and the Liberals have agreed to unite their strength in favour of Sir James and Mr. Ferguson, in order to keep out Mr. W. N. Hodgson. All theparties are canvassing vigorously, Mr. Hodglon personally, Sir James by his agent, Mr. Mones3ey. and Mr. Ferguson by the aid of the latter and his own sons. Sir James Graham has issued the following address;-
o In obedience to your wish, conveyed to me In a requisltion, thau I should explain my conduct aud state my views at the prewent junctue, I attended a public meeting yesterday evening, and without reserve I gcave an account of tbe past and an outune of my intentions for the future. I have no new professions to make-I have no vague excuses to tender for the mode In which I have executed the trust beretofore reposed in ine by you. I come forward once again to ask the renewal of that trust, if your confidence In me remains unshaken. A blustering foreign policy, leading to quarrels In every quarter of the globe, and a staudstill policy at home, when progress is requisite. cannot command my approval, and will not receive my support. I desire no sudden or violent chauges; but I do desire such progressive improvements ins our civil and eccles.astical institutions as the growing wants, the increased intelligence, and the free win of this great commu. nity irresistibly demand. Peace, retrenchment, and reform are sti my watchwords. True to these principles, I shall be ready to support good measures in conformity with them. whatever may be tho Government by which they are brought forward. In supporting them it will be an additional ,stisfaction to me if, happily, they emanate from an Administration professing to be Liberal. Be this, how. ever, as it may, you may rely on my assurance that I win not falsify my professions. Without favour or prejudice I wil endeavour to give effect to the opinions wblch I have frankly laid before you. My cose istn your hands. The decision rests with you To you I appeiL If I should be so fortunate as still to retain you coafideuce I shall be proud indeed of the honoar of serving as one of yoru representetives in the new Parliament."
Air. Ferguon's address, which preceded Sir James's in its appearance before the public, has the following passages:-
| I deem it my duty to aupport the Government of Lord Palmerston against a coadition which has for Its object the supplar ting the present Minitera, wish a view of gettiug peession of their places. With respect to Cainton there are no doubt some transactious of which I cannot approve: but taking a view of the whole subje-t inall lti
bearings, and Unewise considering the motives by which the chlef sup. porters of Mr. Cobden'a motion wero undoubtedly actuated, I found I hadnoother aiteruative than voting asl dii upou that question. Iwish to take this opportunity of correctiug came mi sapysehenslon which I bave reason to believe exists respecting my opinion upon the Jewieh questt.on I am for the admisston of JewA into Parliament. Though I do not tbink their admission woutd unchristianizs the Iogistature, yet I object to the omialon of any words in the oath which would iguore the recog.ition of ours as a Ohristtan Parlianert. This was the case in lhb Oath3 Bill, against which I recorded my vote, whhUe, en the contrary, I would s,tenuously support their admission by a distinct Jewish oath."
Mr. W. N. Hodgson says in his address:-
" I have no now professIons to make. I mintAin the some ardent attachment to the Protestant institutions of the empire, the same desire to Improve them as weU as to preserve the blessings of CivU and seligious liberty. as I hal whea I fast had the honour to win lour ,onfidence. You are awara, gentlemen, that I had nothing to do with the immediate cause of the approacbingdiesolution of Parliament. I deeplylament the lose of life, the destruction of property, the inter. ruption of tale, And the increased taxatioa consequent upon the recent occurrens.s at Canton; bxt I wi I never he a party to any factious motioa having for Its object the mere displacenmert of Lord Paimerstons Government: and if you elect me I ehai feel it my duty to give my unhesitating support to auy Mtinister who may effectnally defend and maintain B,itisb honour aud British iDterest., A sincere
udmiter Of the pr;nclples of eelf gwvernent, I arn atroualy opposed to the sistem Of centralization which has of late yees been adopted by surcessive Administratlous."
ULIT5cEROE.-Mr. John Turner Hopwood has addreMsed the electors on the retirement of Mr. Starkie. He is a supporter of Lord Palmerston on the China question, a friend of the Church, education, agriculture, and commerce.
CORSxWALL (Wzs'T.)-A requisition to Mr. Richard Davey, of Redruth, a county magistrate, is in. course of

There is no' reason to believe that any opposition will be offered by the Conservatives9.
DmBuysHInEn (NORTHs).-The Hon. G. H. Cavendishbha issued an address to his constituents, calling upon them t support hima in the coming election. Hesy,thtdrn
the 23 years he has represented North Derbyshire he has always supported to the best of his ability those measures of social reform and sounid economy which have tended so ,real to the advantage of the country. With reference to "theChinese question, he expresses his regret that the late evenits in China should have taken place at all, but asks:-
" Why are we to talce CommIssioner Yeh's view of the matter, and rive no credit to Sir John llowrlug or Sir Mitchael Seymour ? We sometiime cotaplain that our admirals are afrAId of incurring reapossibUiity. It in that dread of Incuxing res2ionsibility which paralyze the bravest mnen and mars the most promistg enterprises. The late vote of theo House of Commons wiU not do mnuch to encourage our officers when placed in difficult circumastanczs on distant etations. For my part, feeling that a debt of gratitude is due to Lord Palmerston for tbe mannier in whichi he alone of our political leaders-al,preciating the sPirit of the lingllih peopl -conducted tihe late war to a suosessfuli issue, and believing that confidence should be placed In him where the honour anid commercial iutereatsot thLe country aos at staIrs, I had no scruple in giving him my vote on the late occasion.".-
DEVON (NORTH).-We stated on Thursday that a requisition had been sent to Mr. J. W. Buller, of Downes, who is Chairman of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, asking him to come forward as a candidate for North Devon. Since then the hon. gentlemian has issued Isis address, consenting to be put in nomiination. He says -
I 3 believe that no Government could save refused, without an abandoniment of insduty, to uphold its agente insadistant part of the wo?ld, who aeted coueeientioeuly. atid to the heat of their jiudgment. undereircurnstence,4 of peculiar dilllcclty, with the object of prott'ctIng the honoutr of the British flag, the lives'sand properties of British sutb. jecte. and the interests of Brit' sh commerce. It. by your kind support, I should be elected your representative in Parliamesgt, I shall feel It my duty to supiont the Government in insisting on the Itulfilment of public treaties, and compelling the Chinego to respect those Principles of justice and good faitoi which regulate the intercourse between eivilizsd nations. Admoiring the eLergy andf courage with whi.ch he has prosecutod the into war with lins-in, and his Just appreciatioo of the power and resources of the country ; grateful to 1dim for having: sercred all th-3 objects for which the war was unudestaken, and confiding in the wisdom of his policy, the vigour and firmness which have characteried. his Administration, and his decided supPort of Protostautismn, I shall be p'epared to sire an independent support in Lord Palmerston. While due cure in taken to maintain all our eatablIslsmrncts-rilitary. naval, and civil-ln a. slate of the mnost complete efficiency, I wili endeavour to enforce that rigid economy in the public expenditure by which, as far as in posible, the burden of taxation which presses so heaviliN'u the people mnaybe reduced,"
DEYox-ronT.-The electors of Devonport having felt great dissatisf'action -with Sir E. Perry on account of his vote against the Government on the China question, an invitation was forwarded to Mr. R. Osberne, requesting him to p resent himself as a candidate. On the 12th of Mtarch, however, Sir E. Plerry attended a mneeting of the electors and gave such an explanation of his vote, accompanied with sutch strong expressions of confidence in Lord Palinerston's Government and of his determination to give it his support, as induced the meeting to pass a resolution in his fa'our. Mr. Osborne, in acknowledging the invitation -which hehadreceived, expressedhisnselfsensiboleofthehonour conferred upon him ; but added that, after the explanation given by Sir E. Perry of his late speech and vote in the Chsinese debate, and his strong expressions of "perfect confidence" in and "Iadmiration"' of Lord Palmerston's policy, he did not feel himself justified in provoking a contest with so cordial and warm a supporter of the Government, and one in whose views he so perfectly coincided, He, therefore, respectfully declined the invitation.
DuDixy.-Mr. J. Sandars baa issued his address to the electors. The now candidate is "Iin favour of that system of progressive legislation which has for its object the reform of all existing abuses, without having recourse to violent and organic changes in the constitution of Church and State." He "supported and advocated the system of commercial freedom introduced by Sir Robert Peel when the policy of that system was much questioned." He is " strongly of
oinion that it is the duty of the Government, by well-con. sidered reductions in our expenditure, to mnake provision for the final extinction of a talx (the income-tax) valuable in a time of war, but unjust as a permanent burden on the energies and property of the country during a periocl of peace." With respect to the Chinese war Mr. Sandars considers-
" That it was necessary for the honour of the country, as well as for the saeurity of the lives and property of our fellow-eubjecte In that distant quarter of the globe, thai the Government should uphold and defend, wvith that ouarage and determination which have ever cba. racterized Lord Pa ImerBton on such occasions, the conduct of its officers until the adjustment of the points in dispute shall have been obtaiue,"1
It being understood that Mfr. Sandars is "1Lordl Ward's nowcanidae,"a nsneonssecionof heultra-Liberal andi
Toryt eleitorsee of th Lorough d i apeardeter umined to bring
sent Duidley in P'arliament in subversive of the liberty of the subject, and that we will use every sreens in our power to prevent the same beiag carried out practicaiy."
A committee was appointed to look out for a suitable candidate. In the evening another meeting was bald, when there was a very strong feeling expressed against wliat was termied the "Iimpudent usurpationL" of Lord Ward in bringing forward candidates; and the meeting pledged itself that in the event of a man of independent principles being brought forward they would give him their support. Air. Charle Show, and Mfr. Baldwin, of Birmingham, were thought to ho the most likely men. At a meeting which was to be held last night it wvas expected that Mr. Shaw would give his assent to ho put in nomination, and also address the meeting in the capacity of a candidate. The present opposition to what i oal termed "1Castle influence " is said to be un-
prece :denedi Dudley, where the subject is oceasioning great feelinig.
DURHML1 (COUXT'Y).-Mr. R. D. Shafto again offers himself as acandidate. He says:
'Althoujgh I have given a general support to Lord Palmserston's Government, I have never hesitated to advocate any measure which I considered just in Itself, and favourable to that pOrogressive reform o, which we hear so of ten on the huslings and so seldom in the House o' Commons. I have every confidence that Her Majesty's Ministers will in the next Parliament bring ferward measures which will secure for them the approbation of the country and the continued support of these who have acted with them during the present session: and I trust by your favour to be enabled, as your representative, to co-operate with them in effecting thos improvemiente In our institutions which have for the present been unavoidably deferred by theo sudden and unexpected dissolution of the present Parliament."
EYE.-Sir Edward Kerrison offers himself for re-election. There is no opposition thought of.
FAnLMOUTH AUND PENRVRYr.-The candidates in the field for the unit-ed borough are three,-viz., Mr. T. Baring, who lost his election in 1852, Mr. Gwyn, one of the present members; and Mr. Samuel Gurney; the last started on Wednesday. MLr. Baring has nearly finisshed his canvass, and may reckon on a safe return-upon the requisition whieb was sent him somae mionths ago. Mr. Gurney break-s ground against Mr. Gwyn, and being, with M1r. Baring, a suppote of the Palmerston Administration, wilcm adwt him the support of the Liberal section. Mr. Freshfield retires. Mr. Gwyn and lii. Gurney commenced their canvass on Thursday.
FLINTSHRE.s-There is to be a severe contest both for the county and for the beroughs. The presenxt members ( both Ministerialists) are to be opposed by Sir S. Glynne Lbrother-in-law to Mr. Gladstone) and Mr. P. Warren, boths fonservatives.
GLOemi-rsBFSH1RB (WEST).-lir. R. B. Hale, the sitting mnemher, having, retired from the representation, Mr. John Rolt, the Cha~ncery barrister, and a magistrate of this county, has offered himself as a candidate in the Conservative interest. In his address he says :
" The duties of the next l'arllament will be of more than ordinary importance. The line will be more clearly drawn than it has recently been between those who are strugiling for gteat and, fundamental chasnges in the constitution, and those who are opposed to such changes. If honoured -with your contOdence I shall feel it mny duty to act with theoe who desire to maintain the integrity of our instItutIons. and to preserve and strengthen the well-established righte of every class of the community. i shaal at the cauie time gladly assist, with such knowledge and experieuce as I may possess, in the redress or removal of unjust anomalies or other imperfections with which time and the rapid increare of our population. and wesltls may have affected our laws. I will support a, foreign policy that treats every foreign, Power as entitled to the same respect and to the eamue Independence of action in its own affairs thnat we Insist on for ourselves. Such a Policy will necegsaanly give ushsonoutrablo peace as the rule.-and the exception to tha-t rule will never present itself in any form but that of a juszt war. Our military and naval establishments should, no doubt, be maintained at the hightest pitch of effileeney necessary for the eatpport of this policy ; but I am satisfied that, by keeping within this limit, and avoiding an aggressive Policy, our national expenditure may he masterlaliy retrenched, and ouir taxation rendered les, oppresslve.kA tax so unequal and inquisitorial as the income-tax ought never to be tolerated in thIs country as a peace lax, or otherwise than to moet the emergency of some great aod unavoidable war expendi. t,re."
The sitting Liberrl member, Lieutenant-Colonel Kingscote solicits re-election. Another Lioeral candidate is talked of.
HI.TS (SOmT).-Another meeting of the friends of Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, resident in the district, was held at the Royal ifotel, Sonthampton, yesterday (Friday), when there was again a large muster of influential electors, Sir John Barker Mil in the chair. Mr. Henry Bonham-Carter has declined to come forwar.. Sir J. C. Jervoise addressed the farmers at the Corn-Exchange in the afternoon. It is expected that one of the Conservative candidates will withdraw, and a compromise be effected by the election of the other and Sir J. Jervoise.
HLsTO.N.-Mr. Alexander Barclay is contesting this borough otx the Liberal interest, against Sir Samuel Spry. Mr. Schneider, Mr. Vansittert, Mr. VansittartNeille and Mr. Trueman have been respectively named as proAable candidates, but no one bat Mr. Barclay has yet appeared.
HEREFORDSHIRE.-The Liberal candidate, Sir Henry Cotterelt, has comaienced his canvass with extraordinary success, and the general opinion is that he wiJl be returned in the place of Captain Hanbary.
HULL.-Lord William Compton, the brother of the Marquis of Northampton, was adopted by the Liberals at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, as their second candidate, in conjunction with.9r. Clay. In his address he sets forth that he is a sincere Refoimer, in favonr of liberal extension of the franchise, vote by ballot, abolition of churchrates, and reduced taxation. He proceeds:-
" The nation iA paying a jest tribute to lord Palmersteon for the mannmr in which he bar couducted tbe Government of this country through ciruomabuces of grueat difficulty; and, trustiog tbathe wil boxv the Saune zeal for raefozm e. homeo as he has liowvn for England's hou ur abrs.d, bis Goberoment ahall receirs from mne a cordia but independent support. With regad to the question upon which Lord Palmuerntn ha Pow WPoeAlea to thd country, I fully aps'goyp a
coursebehaspursned. and I trust you wll neverrefnse to ratlfy1y sonr verdict tho support given to public ter.ants who have acted to the best of their judgment In defence of the honour of England's flag."
It was understood on Wednesday that Lord Ashley would not stand for Hull; but it appears that he has decided to do so. Yesterday (Thursday) morning his address was issed. He says
" In poUtics I am a Liberal Conservative; and, though personaly
unknown to the constituency, my family has long been connected with I this aistrict by the ties of property, and I can safely promise that. should I obtain the object of my desire I bhell give my utmost attention tothe shlipplng asd other local Interests confided to my care. It wil be my endeavour to uphold the everal inetitutions of the kingdom In all their integrity, not resisting, however, such progress aaisnnprovements as time and experience may bave shbown to be necessary. Pesco and retrenchment shall be over before me, so far ne they can be maintained consistently with the honour and security of the country; and as a stanch supporter of Protestantism I sball firmly oppose every measure calculated to weaken its intereste. The policyof the Government on the Chincee questlon has my cordial approval, and to the Administration of Lord Palmerston I propose to give a general support. He 1a3 carried us succeltully through many difficulties, and there Is no one at present to wbom. In my judgment, the reins of Government could be more safely intrusted."
At noon yesterday his Lordship addressed a large number of electors on 'Change, and afterwards a committee for working his election was formed. His supporters are the ultraProtestant party.
IlSniCiL-The present membeTs, Mr. J. Chevallier Cobbold, a resident gentleman, and 'sr. H. B. Adair, wiiU offer themselves for re-election. A new candidate has, however, appeared on either side-on the Liberal, Mr. Marshman - on the Conservative, Mr. Selwin. It is not, however, at al
lkely that the representation will be disturbed, no doubt existing in the borough that the old members wiU be returned.
LsLE OF Wi=r (CoUVTY).-A candidate has started in the room of Colonel Harcourt (Conservative) retired. This is Mr. R. Wynne Williams, of 29, Bedford-place, who has issued an address, in which he avows his desire to confine his legislotive functions to the interest only of those who elect him to represent them ! He says:-
* In seeking to enter Parliament I have no view (ciel to serve beyond the interests of the constituency by whom I may be elected. My political opinions are, and always hive been, Libe ral, and as I have considerable reliance on tbe judgment and integrity of Lord ralmerston I intend to support his policy, but stili I shall adhere to the principle of measures and not men.'
This gentleman stands in opposition to Mr. Charles Cavendish Clifford, the private secretary to the Premier.
KNAtREssRouoGlr.-There are three candidates in the field, Mr. Woodd and Mr. Collins, on the Conservative interest, and Mr. J. P. B. Westhead for the Liberal interest. The Conservative candidates have completed a canvass of the borough, and express themselves confident of success. Mr. Westhead is very popular with the Liberal electors, and there will no doubt be a smart contest.
LAINCASHSRB (NORT3i).-The retirement of Mr. Heywood has created a vacancy in the northern division of the county. As soon as it was made known the Liberal party of Preston at once decided upon inviting Lord Cavendish to offer himself a candidate for the reprementation. As to his Lordship's political views, he pledges himself a firm supporter of Lord
almerston, and in his address says:-
I am a friend tol thatj liberal course of policy which has during the last 30 years ascomplished such signel resuits in the removal of relgous disabilities, in the reform of our electoral system, and in the recognition and secure establishment of the principles of free trade. Iam prepored to act iu conformity with the op iris of progress, to support an extension of the franchise, and generally such measures as bave jor their object the farther development of a liberal system of
policy."
On Monday, in the Victoria-hall, his Lordship addressed a numerous body of the electors of this town and neighbourhood. His reception wvs most hearty and cordial.
LEICESTERS1ilR1 (NoR'ri).-Lord John Manners has again addressed the constituency of this division of the county. With reference to Mr. Cobden's motion on the Chinese question his lordship avows that he joined in that vote heartily and conecientiously. At first it seemed as if Her Majesty's Ministers intended to ask the electors of Eacland to reverse the solemn decision of the House of Cornmons, hut the subsequent appointment of the Earl of Elgin to supersede the officials who were so censured at once vindicated that vote, and removed the Chinese question from the practical issuesnow submitted to the arbitrament of thecountry. Digressing from the question, he says that it is easy to see that with the return of European peace organic changes in our institutions would be proposed and strongly advocated. Attempts would unquestionably be made to alter the pre sent distribution of political power, and to weaken stil further the infilence exercised by the land upon the administration of affairs. Such attempts his lordship would most firmly oppose. With regard to religious endowments, Lord John says, that no less certain is it that attacks will be made upon all religious endowments (the principle which lies at the root of our constitution in Church and State), and that the temporalities of the Irish Church and all rates by which parishes now maintain the fabrics of services of their churches will be assailed. These attempts, also, if elected, he should deem it to be his duty to repel. Mr. E. B. Earaham, who at preSent represents the northern division of the county, conjointly with Lord John Manners, has also issued an address to the eleotors, in which he states that he should support any desirable scheme of education if religion formed its baSis. Mr. Frewen, an abstract of whose address has already appeared in 2'Te Times, is also in the field, so that a contest may be deemed certain. The main point at issue between Lord John Manners and Mr. Frewen is the question of the Maynooth endowment.
LHcsvTERsuMP. (SOUTHI).-Iu consequence of the retirement of Sir Henry Halford, Viscount Curzon has issued an address to this constituency. He states that his opinions are strictly Conservative, but he cannot consider himself pledged to any party, but wiU claim the right of voting for any measure which he may consider most conduciveto the prosperity of the agricultural equaUy with the manufacturing interests of the country, by whomnsoover brought forward. Ee is a firm supporter of the Protestant Church, and will resist all innovation of her privileges. Mr. C. W. Packe has also addressed the electors.
LICHFIELD.-Lord A. Paget has again offered himself to the constituency. He says:--
"Twenty year, Gentlemen, do not make a brief span in a man's life, and when his votes durine such a length of time! can be freely examined, and are found to be consistent with the opinions which he expressed at his first introcduction, it is needless to resort to those professions wherewith candidates new and strange seek to win a generou s confidence, Being Privileged to reflect upon the experience of a most eventful peorod, I cannot forbear, at thla moment, to congratulate yTo on the succesi appiication of theoe liberal principles which formed the bass of our munual trust, on lie development of free trade, and the steady progress of those reforms which we agreed to eUpport as essential to the stabilty of our InstitHtions and the welfare of the people, I feel it to ba a gratifying characteristic of those meagures, that their manUestly beneficial results have enlisted alliances where hostUiity had long been encountered, converning the more eniightened opponents into sincere advocates; eveu that most vital one, the ballot, which I have ardently supported, still an erception to the gneral auc ess, ha s gradually aconuired increaed strength; and thoagh I have cause to ack nowledgo with pride that freedom of ele3tion may subsist and tr iumph in 1ts absence, it can only be under rare circumstances of iI delity and independence, such as it has been my constant good fortn ne to meet with in the city of lcheield. consider that Lord Palm erston ia entitled to the gratitude and continued confidefioo of the country. He has conducted the late war to a successtul end; he hasconclud ed a safe and honourable peace, which has checked the amnbition of a Power aiming at too extensive domination, and his I ong political career sufficiently proves that while dy estimating the great blessings of peace he is keenly alive to the honour of the British flag, and ea rnest and resolute in protecting British interesis in all parts of the world."
LiNcouc-The sitting members, Major Sibthorp and Mr. George Fieschi Heneage, both offor themselves for re-election, and, despite a movement got up by the extreme Radical
arty to ousto the latter, with every probability of success. Whe gallant major's political conduct since he has represented the city has given the most unanalified satisfaction, not onlv to the Conservative party, with which he is more intimately connected, but also to the moderate Liberal electors-the men who in 1832 rejected the late Colonel Sibthorp and sent to the new Parliament Sir Edward Bnlwer Lytton and the gallant major's present coUeague, MEr. Heneage. Doubtless, there are some among the electors who profers to be dissatisfied with Mr. Heneage. Their opposition has developed itself in the introduction to a meeting of the Radical electors of Mxr. S. indePalmer, a gentleman who was a candidate for the representation of Lambeth on the retirement of Mr. Charles Pearson in 1850. Mr. Palmer gave an exposition of his political creed at a publio meeting on Tuesday night, and expressed hiswillingnessto become a candidate for the representation if a requisition, sufficiently large to enable himn to act up 'a it with safety, should be presented to
m. A resolution was passed deciding to do so, and up to Thursdasynight 300 signatures had been placed upon the document.
MALTON.-Yr. James Brown, of Rossington, near Doncaster, it is understood wiU succeed Mr. J. E. Denison for this borough, who is likely to be elected for North Nottinghamshire, in the place of Lord Henry Bentinck, who retires.
NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.-Mr. George Ridley reached this town on Thursday, and commenced his canvass. The Radical party have been endeavouring to bring out Mr. Joseph Cowen, the ehairman of the River Tyne Improvement Commissioneis, and a large manufacturer, and there is reason to believe that that gentleman would stand provided .a well signed requisition were presented to him. In the event of either of the Liberal representatives being opposad it is not improbable but that a Tory candidate would be
brough f-rward
NORFOLK (WEST).-(BY Electric Telegraph).-Mr. Bagges's retiriDg address was published yesterday (Friday) evening. The hon. gentleman sttes that private reasons and a desire not unnecessarily to disturb the peace of the count', induces him not to offer himself for re-election.
Ir. Bontmnck (Conservative) and ?lr. Brampton Gardon Libeal'aso published their addresses yesterday evening.
Thcformner gentleman adheres to general Conservatie rinCilesthe other aVOWS his intention to support Lord
amerston. it is expected that they will he returnedwithout opposition.
NoTeHA.mPToxsurpR (SoTr).-Thc contest for this divMon of the county is waxing very hot, Lord Althor,p's canvassers are working early and late, and are very sanguine as to the result. The present members, Colonel Vyse and Mr. Rainald Knightley, are conducting a personal canvass, and on Thursday afternoon met a largo body of their supporters at dinner in Banbury. Both gentleimen replied to the toast of their healtk. Colonel Vyse said, that 10 years
ago, when he came forward to represent them, he did so not to gratify any vain ambition, but at the earnest solicitation of the tenant-farmers of the county. He expected that they would not desert him now, as he had not deserted his avowed principles. He had no individual claim upon them, bat the dear Conservative cause had; and he trusted they would use every exertion to achieve a triumph on that occasion. Mr. Knightly wished the contest to be carried on in a fair and honourabt c syirit, and then scrutinized Lord Althorp's princip.e. Heedidnot think his address was logical, for he ret out 1.y stating that because there had not been a Liberal member in during the
last 25 years therefore he would stand; bat he lhougot the
proper inference from that faet was that tlsf counn,y did nno5 want one. Lord Grafton wd Lord Healey(Lib6ils41ad both been rejeted by largo majorities in 1.4& and M ~1M 1ybih gave him a right to conclude the 4wtq_rs sdnt V4
aI Liberal. The present Lord Althorp profes-ed to hold his Uncle's principles; and what were they 1 He had advocated the spoliation of the Church by applying the revenues of that establishment to secular purposes, and he opposed the "Chandos clauses" in the Reform Bill. He had a personal respect for the yOUDg Lord iLsthorp, bu he thought he had not shovn any cause or reason for the electors tarning their baclrs upon their present members. A vote of confidence was subsequently passed in Colonel Vyse and Mfr. Knightley.
NoTTn GHaUsHIRnE (NORTTI).-Lord R. Clinton, brother to the Duke of Newcastle, and one of the present representatives of this constituency, has issued an address announcing himself a candidate for re-election. Alluding to his recent vote on the China question, he says:-
* I wv not ifliuenced in the emallest degree by a&y idea or wish for 5 coalition of oppoing partles, or actuated by any desire to overthrow 1he exsting Government, to whom I have always gives an Independent I ut steady support."
He then continues
"Should you agsin think fit to place your important tust in my hands I sball continue to give my support to a Liberal Government 5nd consistettly advocate the aleviation of such burdens as pres generally upon the people, more espeially thoEe which still remain In the ohape of dulties upon the neceEsaries of life, regarding at cla times the requiremtnts which are ntedful for defraying the proper expenditure of tbc country. During the five years existence of thepresent Parliament the country has wiatnewsed many moet important events, and has engaged in great political and natiotal struggles; and for the last three rears the exertions of Government have of necersity been devoted to the vigorous prosecution and speedy termination of the late war. I trust, however, that the time is no' now far distant when, in the calm of a lasting and sound peace, they may be enabled to tum their attention more exclusively to matters of home legbisation, and bring forward for the consideration of Parliameut such measur as wil conduioe to the improvement and benefit of all classes of the comcaunity."
NOTTryGAIMSHfIlE (South).-Lord Newark (Conserva. tive) again offers himself. Mr. W. H. Barrow, the other member, is also again in the field. In his address just issued he says:-
" Upon the Chinese queotion I paid close attention to long and protracted debates, and was folly convinced that the cause of common humanity as well as the honour and Interests of our country demanded the repudiation by its repreaentstives in Parliament of the proceedings of our officials at Hongkong. And I was persuaded that the continuance of our mo.t important commerce with China, and the safety of the persons embarked In it, were endangered by a perseverance in their violentpolicy. Icould not, therefore, honestlyor conscientiouslly refese my consent to a resolution condemning that policy, altbougb proposed by a member with whom I had no concert, and supported by many parties with %hom I had no political oon nexion. If you honour me with a renewal of pour confidence I thalI continue my eamest endeavours topreserse the fundamental principles of the constitution, carefuly to conEider aU progressive amendmentswbich may be propowedin its details. and bya dli;ent attentiou (at no time more required), to check the wastefal expeadltnreof public money and the consequent increase of onr putlic burdens.'
PRESTON.-Sir George Strickland arrived in Preston on Thursday evening. An offer of acoalition had been made by his frienzds to the supporters of Mr. Grenfell, and declined. Mr. Richard Assheton Cross, a barrister of the Northern Circuit, and residing at Red ScaIr, near Preaton, ia, as we stated yesterday, in the field in the Conservative interest, and addressed a large meeting of the electors and inhabitants on Thursday evening. In his address to the electors, which was issued on Friday, SirGeorge Strickland says:-
I deeply laument the unfortunate events in China; but I could not abandon my friend, Sir John Bowrtng, because he was 10.00 miles distant, and could not be beard in his own d,fence. Placed in a ituation of vast responsibility axd great ditficulty. surrounded by a cruel and half civilized people, and knowing him to be an amiable, a leared and a kind-hearted man, I counider that he must have acted under dcrcumstances of extreme naeesoity. The HEome Govermmen, having ent out inEtructions to arold all possible cause of hostiities, surely cannot be held answerable on the firAt arrival of nuforeseen inteliigence from the furthest extremity of the globe. I feel the importance of giviog a generous suppors to those whom we Intrust In remote countries with British intere-sts and Britishbonour. Inlord Palmeston we have a EStatesman wbo carried us triaompiantly through the late Russian war when deserted by many coUelgues, who, ater sozcur ring in the commenCmuEt of I he Wa, shrank from responsibility, and fled at the f rt appearaUne of difficulty and danger. As ever, I am a supporter of civil and religious liberty. I have on every opportunity voted in favour of Sir Wii rim Ciay's Bw for the abolition of churah-rates, the law respecting them being In a most unsatiofacebry vexatious, and disgraceful state. We bare many : ears been promised a totil reform of the ecclesiastical courts. Their juristicUon In civil matters Is replete with cruelty and it juttice, and ought without delay to be abolished, or transferred to the courts of coMmon law. I am in favour of freedom of speech and writing."
RETrFORD (FAST) AsD BA5SETLAW.-The Hon. W. B. Duncombe, one of the prcsent members, has announced Isis intention of resigning his seat in favour of the new candidate, Mr. F. G. ts. Foljbmbet so:l of M G. S. Foljambe, of Osberton-hall, Notts, on the ground thiat the latter being a resident in the district, and having large estates there, has a pnror claim to the suifrages of the constituency. Viscount Ga'ilway is the other candidate' in the field, and there is everv probability that he will be re-elected, in conjunction with' hIr. Foljambe, without opposition. The lattrr is a Liberal, and Viscount Galway is a Conservative. Mr. Duncombo al'so is a Conservative, so that Lord Palmerston will gain one seat here.
RIPoN.-Mr. J. A. Warre, of 54, Lowndes-square, London, has complied with an invitation from somo of the electors of this borough, and has become a candidate for its representation. In hls printed address to the electors he r,ays:-
"The caue of the appeal now made to the c~ustituexcies of the nnited kingdom Is to be found in that recent and singular combination of parties, who, differlig so widely among themselves upon other mat. ters. Agreed to place the Queen's Government in a minority upon 3r~ Cobden's motion. Lamrnen. as I do, that extreme measures of hostity have been resorted to by contending parties in Chins, I cannot
tbink that the Queen's Government woutld have done wisely in dl,avowing, or recalling, their representative at Canton; and I also venture an op;iion that had some of the leading opponents of Lord Palmerstou hadtho responaibillty of offdce on their shoulders they wouldhaveadopted thecourse which hbasbeenpursued. For mself, allow me to say that when, during 16 years, I sat in the House of ComasonR, myvotes were always given ir suPport of ivil and religious liberty, and that well-considered measures of improvement and reform political and socal, met with my hearty concurrence. It is my dedire now to act upn the same principles."
ROCIrEsTX -After a considerable amount of difficulty the Conservative party. in this city have succeeded in securing a candidate to oppose hlr. P. W. Martin and Mr. 8erjeant Kinglake in the person of Mr. George Henry Money, of Berkeley-street, Berkeley-square. Mr. Money arrived from London on Thursday, and immediately issued an address to the electors, in which he states that he is opposed to the Parliamentary grant to Maynooth, and also to the continnxnce of the income-tax after 1860 He is in favour of a reduction of taxation, and would also support every proposition which tended to uphold the honour of our flag abroad or our national well-being at home. His committee and friends were actively engaged canvassing the electors yesterday, but without much apparent success. The friends of the Liberal candidates express the greatest conafdence in those gentlemen being returned by a very large majority.

Healdl late t. for Oldham, and some other gentlemen have f een maentioned in the Government interest, hot the only candidate in the field is Sir Elkanax Artnitage, who addresses the elect rs nd an old and tried reformer.
SHtOREHAI (BORtObG}I OF NEgw) Ah-D R.PE OF BitAuiBEall-A new candidate presented himself to this constituency on Thursday, Mr. H. W. Pemberton, who addressed a meeting of his friends last night at the Buckingham Arms, New Shoreham. He comes forward as anr independent Liberal prepared t Fupport Lord Palmerston's Government, the ballot, and extenison of the sufirage. In his address,
vhich will be issuedto hday, he says:
bnhe ground ou wvhich I rest car claim to your suifragns i that of advocaing wan supportine the steadry derelopemet of cIvlU and rtligiousliecy. Asconnectedwilth the former is the extension of the ranchise, which the growm in enteldigence of the country new demands and the means of exe rsing the right of voting, free from ndmffida
fion and undue Infuence. My attention wil be devoted to alt those measures whch have for their obJect the amelioration of the condition of the working classes, and especiallyto any wrell-digested measure for their educational improrenent.Q I will give L,ordPalmerston's Government my firm but independent suppore Without entering Into the merits of the Chinese question, I think the conduct of Lord Psimeroton's Government In supporting our representatives in China was dIctated by a proper sense of what wass doe to the honour of our country ant to our fellow-comntrymen in that quarterot the globe, whose lives ana property wrere In danger. I wUil support a well-considered economy in every depastmsut of the Slate, at the same time that it does net impair the efficiency ot our naval and military services."
His reception by the Liberals of Shoreham was most flattering, and he has pledged himself to go to the polL
SsoEWSBntY.-tMr. Huddleston and Mlajor Phibbs have addressed the electors in the Conservative interest.
SOUTHAMPTON.-Messrs. W311cox and Weguelin, the present Liberal members for this borough, are to address the electors at the Victoria-rooms on l'uesday evening next. There is not theleastsymptom of any opposition, the union of the Liberal party having, as was expected, prevented any Tory candidate entering on a thoroughly hopeless contest.
SOUTrsWuAR.-Mr. Apsley Pellatt has reconsidered his determination to retire from the representation of this borough, and he now announces his intention to go to the polL In all probability he will be returned. Mr. Scovell intends, it is said, to ontest the borough, and Mr. Locke will also go the poll.
STAFFORD.-Mr. C. B. Locock has offered himself for the borough. He says:-
" It is with much regret that I observe that your present member Mr. Wise, does not intend to come forward for re-election for the ensuing Parliament. My principles sre Liberal, asd I shonld support with much satisfaction the Government of LDrd Palm erston. The efficiency with which that tatesman conducted the war with Russia. and the courago he displayed inlIniiting on the fulfiment of the cODn ditions of peace, entitle him in my opinion to tho gratitude and confidence of the nation. The eoarae which he baspurened on tbe Cbhince question daims for him our further admiration. Regardleas of the combinations of parties he has nobly supported those public servants who have acted to the best of their Judgment in circumstancs of peculiar diffclnlty, and he now appeals fromn the Comecmog to the country for approval of his conduct. Should you elect me you wil declrethatYouarewfingtocontinuolj hands the direction of the foreign policy of the empire."
STOCKPORT.-Mr. William Gibb, 4f Manchester, spirit mnerchant, has addressed tbe electors in the Conservative interest. Mr. Kershaw and Mr. J. RB.qmnith are before the electors in the Liberal interest.
Bizlop,-Notwibbstanding the sscencs o f the Con-
se r7ative party in the borough up to the present time, and despite the reported intentions of the leaders of the pilrty not to oppose the present memabers, an address was issued yesterday morning by Admiral Herbert, one of the present members for Dartmouth, soliciting tho suifragos of the electors on Conservative principles, "in complnce vwith an invitation from a most respectable and influentialportion of the constituency." Adminrsd Herbert eays,.~
*-houldyon do me the bonour ot eecting we, I sball be prepared to advocate an immediate revision of tbe national expenlditme and taxation, as the only true means of bringing about the total repeal of the iooome-tax-a tax I bave always ooneidered mest inquisitorial and unequal, snd aepreselg with undue severity on the professional and trading clase, and onlyto be rorted to il the tevaeser neesities of stateroqulireenta. 1ordPsamestonhavingdeclaredhimseltoppoe" to the introductlon ofote hob ballot, of extension ot te uffrge and othermeasuresofprogreesiverefor,n, I feelmyself quiLeincapableof gitsing asy pledge as regards a general supolrt or opposition to his 5inlaBy, but must reserve my opinins unti his memnes may bo broeaht under the congideration of Parliament. It will, however, be ny desire to give an independent support to every propoa which seems to me beneficial to the country witbout referenee to the Idlvidual from whom it mry emanate, though Ishall conacientiously opposo every Scheme of speCulative innovation which seems to distuzbwith. out improving the arrangements of our ocia Esystemn"
The friends of the new candidate have been actively engaged in canvassing to-day. The leaders of the anti-income. tax movement-a " declaration " against which was signed by 500 electors-are urging the declarationists to vote for Bengough and HIerbert, the Radical and the Conservative, as the greatest opponents of the tax. Nothing whatever has been heard or seen of Mr. Mereiventher Turner since his address, and not the slightest movement has taken place in his behalf. A parties are conducting their operations with remairkable quietness.
SUFFOLK (EASrYmu Drviroir).-Sir lFituroy Kelly and Lord Henniker offer themselves for re-election, There is a good chance for a Liberal candidate, but at present no prospect of the appearance of such a one. Both the members are against Lord Palmerston.
SUFOLas (WEST).-Mr. Waddington and Mr. P. Bennet intend to offer themselves for re-election, but a numerously attended meeting of the freeholders of the division was held at the Town-hall Bury St. Edmund's, on Wednesday for the purpose of procmring a candidate to oppose the firstnamed gentleman, who in his address confesses his own inability to properly represent the constituency. The meeting was also convened to express full confidence in Lord Palmerston's administrative policy. On this point the meeting was most unanimous, as it was in selecting Mr. Fuller Maitland Wilson, of Langham-hall, as a candidate. That gentleman has consented to stand, and his address, just issued, says:-
" Tbzt tho Government of this country should be placed in a inority on an important question of foreign policy I should. under an,
circumstances, oonsider as most unfortunate: but thst such a subject sbould bave been made use of for party purposes (wbich I cannot but believe to have been the case on the present occasion) I conceive to be higbly injurious to the character of our frea instituticnus. Lord Palmerston reeponded to his coumtry's cal u,nder most trying cirumstances, when others had failed, and led us with courago and ablitv througb a war of unprecedented dlfficulties to the condcluion of an honourable peace ;and I believe itto have been principsily owing to his firmness and skilU that the terms of that peaco have not been evaded. The country Is deeply in his debt, and I think that there is no man at the present momcnt Eo well quahlied wa he is to hold the reins of govemment. With zrgard to the question which is the immediate cause of the preseut appeal to the conutry I tinuk that the Government pursued a wise and honoumble oourse in supporting our agenta who ame preserving at the other side of the globe the honourof ourflag and the livesandpropertyof our feUosw-ubjccot"
There is little doubt that he will be returned, as Mr. Waddington, a Conservative, will scarcely venture a contest.
SUNDERLAIND.-Mr. Hudson prosecuted a most successful canvass yesterday, a-ad was received with a more cordial and hearty welcome than on anyprevious occasionby allclasses of electors, and their determination to support him was expressed in the most generous terms. It is universally admitted that no rival can affect the security of his election; and those who are candid, and can correctly estimate the true position of each of the candidates, consider Mir. Hudson will poll the largest number of votes ever recorded at a contest m this borough. Mr. Hoare, finding the Liberal party so much divided, has issued an address, in wlhich
a declines to stand as a candidate, and Mr. Mitchell will not be a candidate in consequence of Mr. Hudson having again come forward. Mr. Mitchell closes his address by saying, "I cannot hut admire the feeling which exists among you in favour of Mr. Hudson in return for the faithful services he has rendered your port." This from a rival is strong evidence of Mr. Hudson's popularity among the electors. Mr. Walters is prosecuting a most vigilant canvass, but he has not a remote chance of success. Mr. Fenwickhas just held a meeting of his supporters at the Exchange, consisting of the leading members of the Whig party and the old coneistent and influential Liberals. He was most enthusiastically received, and great unanimity prevailed. He entered freely into the public questions of the day, and expresssed his views in accordance with the consistency of his former public professions and his conduct in Parliament. No one who knows anything of the general feeling in the town can doubt the election of Mr. Fenwick in conjunction with Mr. Hudson.
SURREY WEST.)-A numerous and highly-respectable meeting of the friends of the Liberal cause in West Surrey was held at the Albion Hotel, Epsom, on Thursday, Mr. W S. H. Fitzroy in the chair, when a resolution was adopted to the effect that MIr. John Ivatt Briscoe deserved the support of the electors, and was fit and in all respects quali. fled to represent the Western division of the County of Surrey in Parliament, and that the meeting would use every effort to carry out that object.
TutrwORTil.-The address of Sir R. Peel to the electors of Tamworth has appeared. It is dated from the Admiralty and is as follows:-
I By one of tbese rare combinatious wbich have occaionally disturbed the course of the most powcrful and popular Administrations, Lord Paslmerston!s Goverument has found itself compelod to appeal to the sere and justice of the ooeutry aainst an adverse but aocidental vote of the House of Commons upou a question involving the diguity of the British flag, and the lives and properties of our fellow-countrymen 13.000 mUies ditant from the shores of Eug land. Gentlemen. the China question has b en elected as the baLttle feld of party strife, and, although the House of Lords by a large majority entirely approves tho conduct of Hler Majcsty's Govermsuant
althougk alao tho Church In its representativos couples the sanction of her authority with the volce of public opinion out of doors, in the House of Commons special pleading and the impatience of faction have sucmeeded in thvwarting the dictates of prudenoo, and consoluently the country is unexpecteal plunged at this season of the rear into a Parlmentary criis. The Govcrn-ent, however, strong In tho advocaey of a just cause, and with Her fajestys gracious assent, has cheerfuny accepted the challenge, and a dissolution wil immediately terminatO the present Parliament, and send us back to our constituents. There can be no doubt as to tho result of a gneral election-the country is alive to its own interests, and 'the man wo are all so proud of,' to qnote the wards of my late honoured predeceosr, wiU find that he has not miscalculated either tho rympathics or tho support of pubUe opinion. My duties and responsiblitites as your representative wiUl naturany ceese in a few days and in offeridg myself again as a candidate for the suiffragesof tho electors ot Tamvworth I earncstly hope that both upon publc and private groundsI may look forward with oonfideuce to a renewal of the trust with wvhcb you have already honoured me on thre suconessive ocasions. Gentlemen, I am justly proud ot the distinction conferred by the title of * Member of TamwortL, *and while I value your poltical confidence I hope never to forfeit the good will and esteem of my neighbours and fellow-townsmen.
An extract from the address of Sir Robert's colleagne, Viscount Raynham, appeared in The Times of Monday. As there are no other candidates in the field, these, the sitting members, will be re-elected without opposition.
THErFORD.-The. Hon. Francis Baring and tho Earl of Euston both offer themselves to the electors of this borough for re-election. The addresses of both candidates arebrief in the extreme. The former merely refers to his connexion with the borough for a quarter of a century. Theaddress of the latter is also contained in one paragraph, which says:-
" Pecullar circumstances have brought on the approaching diSouItlon. A oombinod attack of parties upon the Goverament with referenoe to the state ofatrairs in China has boen successfuL Though I deplored the extreme measures to which the authorities in China resorted, I felt it my duty, under the manyconfiUcting circumstances o. the question, not to withhold mys uppors from the Government of Lord Palmerston. I trust my vote on that occasion was in accordance with the views of a majority of you."
WEsnioRETL&\D.-Lord Bective and the Hon. Colonel Lowther have both iseued addresses intimating that they shall shortly wait upon their constituents. They are both opponents of the Government. There will be no contest.
WRY-mouTH.-The return of Mr. L J. R Campbell, in conjunction with Colonel Freestun, is certain. Mr. Campbell avowedly comes forward to support Lord Palmorston's Government. He addressed 500 or 600 electors on Tuesday night, and the show of hands in his favour was unanimous. He has commenced his canvass under the most favourable auspices. MIr. Butt's reception the previous evening was very cold.
WHrsrE'Y.- 3r. IL Stephenson haspresented himself as a candidate for re-election. In his address to the electors he aa;s, with regartd to the Canton affair, that he could not, with the present amount of information on the subject, condemn the Government, and had he been present on the evening of the debaxte ho shou'id have supported Lord' Palmerston. MIr. Stephenson's return willi not be opposed by the Liberals.
WOL tERILUaXPTON.-Messrs. Villiers and Thornely, the sitting members, and Mr. Rupert Kettle, the now candidate, have commenced addressing the electors. On Thursday night they all spoke at Bilston, the present members occupying one part of the town and their opponent the other. MIr. Vilhiers's referenco to Lord Palmerston raised expressions which shoed that the Premier ewas exceedingly poar in Bilston, an well u~pon the China question as with reference to his horne policy. Alluding to desires that rome had expressed that he (Mr. Villicrs) should stand
alone this election, he slid that there ws no better business member in the Hose of Commons than Mr. Thorno ely, and he should stand or fall by his colleague. The meeting, which comprised the stanrl supporters of free trade and Liberalism in Bilston, were unanimous in their promises to support tho sitting members. At Mr. Kettle's less numerous meeting there was equal Danimity displayed in his behalf. The fiord days wrill be at Wolverhamptont where Mr. Kettle was to speak last night, and where the sitting members are announced to address the electors on Mronday evening. A requisition has beon got up to Mr. John Hartley, ironmaster and magistrate, of the firm of G. B. Thorneycroft and Co., of Wolverhampton, to solicit him to come forward
in the Conservative interest; batt it is not expected that he will accede to the request.
YoRK.-Up to the present moment no candidate has been definitively mentioned as the successor of Sir W, Mmlner. Several meetinge of the Liberal electors have been held, at one of which Mr. Alderman Mfeek, who has been thrice Lord Mayor, and has taken an ative part in all matters of local intereet, was desired to allow bimself to be placed in nomination. He. however, declined in consequence of his advanced age of 7 years. At present there are the names of three or four gentlemen mentioned, but Sir David Dundas is the one mvst likely to be sslected. Sir David was formerlyone e of ihea members of Lord John Russells Administration, but his delicate health used him to redga. Hlis health havi been restored b e is now pre-
paei Again to enter-Parhament. A committee appointed tosb n .a caudidaste 'dL proort the resclt a ther pro-

YORKSHIRE (NosTr RsDING).-There will be a sever& contest in this riding between MIr. Cayley, the old Liberal member, and tho lon. J. a. Dandas, who Opposes him. The return of the Conservative candidate, the Hon. O. Dann combe, is regarded as certain. Theriding is beingcan. vassed on Mr. Cayley's behalf. Mr. Dundas has addresed. the electors at Guisborough, Thirsk, and other places, at. mnost of which places resolutions have been passed promis. ing the hon. gentleman the support of those present. AtW Thirsk, however, Lord Greenock addressed the meeting oe, behalf of the old members-Mr. Cayley and Mr. Duncombe.
SCOTLD.
GRIESOCK.-SirlRenrylawlinson addressed theconstituency onThuraday, the 12th, andFriday.the 13th inst., stating: that he came forward in conse nonc of Mr. Dunlop's retirement, and explained bis political viewsw, which seemed tomeeb. with general approval. Mr. Dunlop's friends suggested that he should be invited to return; and Sir Henry replied! that if he accepted this invitation he would not oppose him. On Saturday two deputations were sent to Mr. Dunlop, without obtaining any satisfactory answer. On Monday Mr. Dunlop visited Greenock in person, and stated that he could not withdraw his resignation or enter on a contests Vith a candidate already in the field. Sir Henry acordmgly issued his addre8s to the electors on Tuesday, supposing that he had no longer a competitor. On Wednesday, howevr,e etter was received from M. Dunlop, announcintr , tha,t if retuned by his friends he should accept the meat. This letter had hlrdly been made public when a telerDhic mesisge was received directing its ugppression. tsotherreference was then made to Mr. Dunlop by thlegrapb, anc
the final answer was received in the afternoon, that he withdrew his resignation and 'would standl for tho burfix unconditionally. Sir Henry had thus no alternative, m. consistency with his Plodge already gien, but to retire from the field. Mr. Dunlop 'wll probablyd ret withi not further opposition.

He app roves the conduct of the presentGovernment, and would give it his cordial but independent support. So far as appears, there is but little difference between the miews of the new candidate and Mr. Elien, who seeks a renewal of the trust he has held for 20 years.

An addres to Mr. Roe was adopted, and his answer was expected to be given on Friday (yesterday). It is, however, already pretty well understoo
that Mr. Roo is not unwillng to ru the risk and fearful expense of a contest such as the one he is about to embark- in.
