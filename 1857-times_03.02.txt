I. That thin Board enitertains a deep conviction that it ls unnecessary to provide by legislati,e eLacto ente " for he better encouragement and increased edlictezry of eoucatton in the corporate cities and horousha of England and Wales," I elieving that education is the work o' the people themselves, nd that their effcrta lwitlboth increase and iln rove the mneans of Intruction to an extent unattainable by any Goveramental interference.
IL. That thin Board considers the Bill1 introduced Into Parliament by S;r John P3kint1on1, open to the most serious objections on the followhinggrourds:-
1. That, while re-ognizilng local management, it concedes to the parochial or other commuittee no independent power, since the autherity of the Comamittee of Privy Council is made paramount in all questions w,hichi bave rreremnce to the affairs of the sebhonl
2. That. since it, pravides amople maeans for the support of schools irrest,ective of roluntary tub,criptione, it will supersede the superintenneisce of popular ed~cation by thoe, e who ame meet interested In, and l est qualified to promote, its extension and imjproerevet. and oousilln tiea training of the )outhful popuiatli n to official managemerit.
3. That it degratcts education by lnCorpcrhting a provision for its enprort with bhe poor rate, Ihus identifying education with pauperism lo tte extent to whi,ch its arrangenients masy he adopted.
4. That It inadequately provides for the relgious instruction and Itrainiing of the young, aff-cding no guarantee for the religious cha-
racter of the teacher. esnctieoing an arranlgement for Eeytatin dIrect
rell. iou,- teaching frum the orditesryroutine of the school, and alowing the public monecy to be granted to schools In vahich any reigion or no icligon maLy be tauight.
5. '1hat It dlecour3ges self-relying efforts in the education' of the ~ennllr and operates as a cheek to the evidently growing desire of pereets to prouide,'even at somne sacrifice, for the education of their
I. Thatg It separates the teacher from those towards whiom he ought to sustain the most intimate and( reponsiblbe relation, constituting him a stirendiary under the control of the Slate, and subjecting him to i, fiuences incompatible with the proper discharge of his important funactions.

This Company is formned for the eslnulialnmeut of steam ferries, or floating bridget. at various points across the river Thames.

To weret the requiermiente of tee Immense traflfe to andl froM thue Docks, oiu the north side of the Thamnes, the Compnany propose to establish awelr-organized system of Steam F"erries, similar to thooe introdure BO years ago by Mr. Rtendel. C.E., and still plying mroet wue-

-- Wepay not only with our money but our lives. For the worst of it is. that the articles we purchase are not rirerely diluted-they are aduldteratctd-p)ositively-abominat.ly-poieonously, Tnere is scarcely a snigle art-tie of daily use which it ls possible to procure genuine from ordqinary shopo

So long as any of tho sharoe are held. the shareholder derives the advantage: and in the event of hia deciring to sell any portion of them, itwill greatly enhance their value in the market.
After carefisl cacWslation and allowine for every contingercy, it is anticipated that the net profits will realise at least 15 Per cent, per annum.
Incorporation bas been obtained under the Joint-Stock Companies' Act ot 1855, with limited liability. By this means the shareholders are enabled to earty out, Ec.Urely and prolttably to themselves and advantageonely to the public, a plan which will go far to annihilate the present fraudulent and most d.-ngeroue system.

DUBLIN, SATUrDAY MORNING. THE IlISH COURT.
Among the many curious stories which may at some future day form materials for the historian of the Irish Court, there is one at present in general circulation, which, if the facts be not exaggerated, will be the not the least amusing of the series. Three ladies, daughters of a gentleman, residing in a county town not 30 miles from Dublin, not having been honoured with cards of invitation, determined to try their chance of admnission without going through the necessary forms, ani they were successful. Although quite unknowsn to the rest of the guests, they obtained partners, and danced merrily throughout the night. At length, questions began to be asked as to the identity of the fair strangers, and Mr. Bagot, the Chamberlain, having conisulted his list, speedily ascertained that they had come unbidden to the feast; but no further notice was then taken of the matter, and the ladies were permitted to finish the nig,ht as they had begun it. On the day following, however, a billet from the Chamberlain's office -was despatched to the intruders, requesting to know upon what authority they had attended the ball on the night previous, as most positively he (the Chamberlain) had not furnished themwith the requisite passports. The reply to this was candid, and even conciliatory. They admitted that they had not been honoured with invitations, but they kindly attributed the omission to an oversight on the part of the Chamberlain, but as they knew that no offence was designed no more need be said upon the subject. The answer to this explanation was written in a totally different spirit, as the ladies were politely informed that upon a review of the case the LordLieutenant had come to the conclusion that their presence at the next Drawing-room could be dispensed with. Nowise abashed by this intimation they rejoined that such a co cmunication was altogether superfluous, as before its receipt they had reconsidered the slight put upon them on the previous occasion, and had resolutely made up their minds to discountenance the Irish Court for the rest of the (so-called) fashionable season.
THE IRISH SOCIAL REVOLUTION.
The Tipperary tenantry of Captain Robert Jocelyn Otway, R.N., entertained their landlord at dinner last Mlonday on the occasion of the gallant officer's return from service in the Black Sea. The company comprised all creeds and classes-relgious and poltical-parsons and priests fraternizing with each other in a spirit of charity and goodwill that makes one regret that there are not more Captais Otway to illustrate the progress of the Irish social revolution in the decline of those bitter sectarian animosities which have been so long the bane of this country. At the dinner in question the Rev. Mr. Jorden, the Protestant rector of Templederry, filled the chair, and in the course of theevening proposed as a toast, " the Catholic Clergy," and coupled with it " the health of Father Kenyon." The name of the renowned parish priest of Templederry, the able clerical firebrand of the troublous vear 1848, has not yet perhaps wholly escaped public recollection, and if it havs, his identity will be scarcely recognized as the promulgator of the sentiments embodied in the rev, gentleman's brief response to the compliment thus paid to him and to his order:-
"Tbe Rev. Mr. Kenyon said, that he had adifracult duty to discharge-to propose the health of the Rev. Mr. M'Donnell (hear), and of the Protestant clergy of this and surrounding districts, and indeed of the county- he might go further, and say the entire country. (Cheers.) With respect to the object of the toast, he laboured under the disadvantage of not having the pleasure of his acquaintance, so that he conld mot say anything of his private qualities or virtues; atl he could say was that he had never heard anything bad of him (hear), and that was saying a good deal. He (the Rev. iMlr. Kenyon) would rather treat him as the representative of his order and for the purpose of exemplifying the subjeot. As long as he (the rev. speaker)had had the power of reasoning, and before it-at all events, as long as he could recollect, he hadbeen at aloss tounderstand why aCatholic clergyman could not rejoice in the health of a Protestant minister. (Cheers.) He did not know the reason why they should be sparring and boxmg instead of living in amity and goodwill. (Cheers.) If it were a Jewish or a Turkish priest, he could see no cause for their going to loggerheads. (Hear.) So far as he recollected wvhat he had read even the heathen could afford to live on terms of friendsbip, and why should those who had all the benefits of Christianity be violating the principles of Christian charity, forbearance, and love? (Cheers.) Though this state of things might go on for a time it must ultimately come to an end (hear), for mutual toleratioa must prevail. (Cheers.) Bigotry was too revolting to the feelings of the human beart to be perpetuated. (Cheers.) They lived there in a retired region, no doubt, but it was a beautiul region, and though small, yet being central, from that meeting would go forth east, west, north, and south, the wholesome principles of toleration and good feeling (cheers)' and others, seeing the happy effects, might go and do likewise. (Elear.)"

Royal Italian Opera.
ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA.
The question about the future permanent home of the Royal Italian Opera after the present season has expired may, there is good reason to believe, be looked upon as settled. Ever since the destruction of Covent Garden Theatre by firc rumour has been busy with the topic. Burlington-house, Devonshire-house, and the site of the old buding were respectively and confidently named; and it was even asserted in some quarters that, in the course of another year the Royal Italian Opera would altogether cease to exist. The last alternative was by no means probable, since an institution in the formation of which so much energy, we.th, and perseverance had been expended, and which had gained an European reputation, was not very likely to succumb for want of efforts to save it, even before the terrsble results of a conflagration; and as Mr. Gye, with great pains and no smallamount of resolution, had contrived to keep the whole of his companytogether in another place and thus fulfil his pledgesto the public and his obligations to his artists, during the season of 1856, it was reasonable to suppose that he entertained plans for the ultimate restoration of his establishment to something like its ancient footing. At present there is no longer any cause to doubt that a new theatre wiU be built upon the ruins of the old, and the Royal Italian Opera absolved from any further necessity of shifting from year to year the scene of its operations.
It has been very generally suspeeted for a long time pas' that negotiations were pending with the Duke of Bedford, and that the end in contemplation was to obtain his Grace's permission for erecting another theatre on the sam-e site where so lately stood the edifice made famous by the Kembles. Until last week, however, no arrangement had been concluded; but we are now informed, upon the best authority, that the necessary documents are signed. The Duke of Bedford has leased to Mr. Gye, for 90 years, not only the ground upon which Covent garden Theatre stood, but also that which is covered by the Piazza Hotel, together with other tenements in the rear, extending into Hart-street -the whole being equivalent to upwards of an acre of land. The lease becomes the more advantageous to the holder from the fact that it is unfettered by any of those drawbacks, such as renters' privileges, property boxes, &c., which weighed so heavily on former administrations. The only reservation exacted by his Grace is one private box for his own family.
Some few particulars connected with the plan of the new building may not be uninteresting to our readers. The area
of the t eatre will be considerably larger than previously, | comprising an enclosure of 240 feet by 100. The roof is to constitute a span of 100 feet, without any intermediate supports-so that the scenery and stage app".rtenances may be removed at the shortest notice, andI the whole interior converted into a vast concert-roomo 'he buildinig is to be entirely fireproof, the timbers being prepared on the fireproof process which is now adopted in constructing the Goverument lighthouses.
Although the space to be occupied by the theatre is necesearily large, it wi not include the wh,,le of the ground comprehended in the lease. It is intended to devote the reaininng portion to a flower-market, in the shape of a vast glass bazaar, 80 feet in diameter and 250 feet in length, for the exhibition anu sale of flowers, plants, and all the objects and conveniences that incidentally relate to them. This idea was suggested by the well-known Na.rchi aeux Pleurs, which forms one of the most popular and agreeable lounges in that city of loungers, Paris.
ORDERS OF REMovAL.-In the year ending the 25th of March, 1856, there were 14,860 personis removed from parishes in England and Wales under orders of removal, against 12,745 in 1854-55. The amount of the expenses incurred in the removal, including the cost of obtaining the orders, the service of the same, and the travelling expenses of the paupers removed (but not the cost of the relief before removal), was 18,3651., against 15.571f9. in the preceding year.

The prospectus has been issued of a new Indian railway company, to be called the " Northern iBengal,"with a capital of 2,000,0001., in 201. shares. The object is to open up the rich country on the north of the East Indian line, by constructing a branch from Rajhmahal to Dinajpore and Darjeeling, the hill district on the frontier of Nepaul. By this route of between 200 and 300 miles transport would be furnished for a large amount of valuable produce, and the longsought means of preserving the health and life of Europeans by a cheap and ready access to a climate like that of England would be fully attained. Among the promoters are some of the best-known names connected with Indian enterprise.
Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in stosks and shares during February. The range of Consois has -been limited to 14 per cent., and the result of the operations of the month has been to establish an advance of i per cent. In the railway-market the tendency has been steadily upward, and the average improvementhas been equal to more than 5 per cent.

DUFI2G TIE MONTE OF FEBRUARY. 1857.
On the continental Bourses the movements of the month have also been favourable. At Paris the advance established in French Rentes is exactly two per cent. At Amisterdam and Vienna, however, the rise has been slight.
The Maid of Judah, from Sydney, brings 6,030 ounces of gold, valued at 24,0001. The Helen Baird has also arrived, but is not believed to have brought any gold or sovereigns.
The railway meetings of the week have been numerous, and have comprised several of the principal companies. The dividend of the Eastern Counties has been confirmed at the rate of 5s. per share, and the report adopted, the shareholders generally expressing a favourable opinion with regard to the reorganization of the manaagement. At the South-Eastern meeting the statement of the directors was considered satisfactory, and the dividend of 15s. per share was agreed to. The shareholders of the Staines, Wokingham, and Woking Junction Railway have adopted the report detailing progress. It is stated that the goods traffic is expected to be remunerative, but that the passenger traffic suffers from competition. The dividendcof the Midland Company has been carried at the rate of 4i per cent., an amendment to increase it to 4i having been defeated. The reportof the A'nbergate, Nottingham, and Boston Railway shows an improvement in the goods and coaching traffic, but that connected with minerals has decreased. The dividend of 2s. 8d. per share was carried. At the East Lancashire meeting the results of the half-year were considered satisfactory; the dividend declared on the ordinary stock was at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, and the directors were authorized to make arrangements with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company for workinv the two lines in commnon. ThA %ividp.m1 nf
the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway will be at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, leaving, after the payment of other charges, a balance of 5,7191. The directors of the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Company recommend a dividend at the rate of 3Sj per cent. per annum. According to the report of the Vale of NZeath Company the revenue will allow a dividend at the rate of 4i per cent., less income-tax, and leave a surplus of 9501. The dividend of the Waterford and Limerick Railway will be at the rate of 5s. per share on the original stock. The report of the Norfolk Railway has been published, showing that the dividend on the ordinary stock will be 21. for the halfyear, or at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. The proposed dividend of the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction wiU be at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. A great improvement has taken place in the financial positioIi of the East Kent Railway. The works between Strood and Faversham have advanced rapidly, and the line wiU be opened to the latter place by Septemnber. Tt is proposed that the Dublin and Belfast diidend shall be at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, leaving 8,2191. to be carried forward. The Dundalk and the Enniskilen line, it is thought, wil be opened to Lisnaskea in the summer. The traffic shows a slight increase, and the dividend recommended is 6s. per share. The dividend of the North-Western Company at the rate of 2s. 3d. per share has been declared, and the report adopted. The traffic has not been well supported, owing to the diversion of the carriage of Scotch pig-iron, &c., through the war, but a portion is now returning. At the meeting of the North and South-Western Jinction Railway the report, with a dividend at the rate of 5i per cent. per annum, was agreed to. The coal and passenger traffic exhibits a very satisfactory improvement. The report of the Thames Haven Company has been approved, and the directors state that the presslure on the money-market has rendered it unadvisable for the directors to enter into contracts which would have necessitated speedy caUs. The shareholders of the West Cornwall Railway have adopted the report, after explanations with respect to diminished traffic. The dividend of the North Devon Company will be at tne rate of 1 per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock, and a reduction has been made in the debenture debt from 144,8001. to 128,0001. At the Bideford Extension meeting it was stated that the traffic promises to be remunerative, but that the directors are at present compelled to apply the rent received from MIr. Brassey to the payment of debts, instead of dividends. A majority of the shareholders of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company have adopted the report, and a dividend of 2i per cent. has been declared. The opposition exhibited was in relation to the litigation with the Stirling and Dunfermline Company. The report of the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway has been adopted, and a steady increase of traffic, with a reduction in expenses, has taken place. The preference dividends having been declared the directors were authorized to create debenture stock to pay off loan capital amounting to 150,0001. At a special meeting of the Namur and Liege ancd the Mons and Manage Company it was agreed to ratify the convention entered into with the Belgian Government for leasing the Mons and Manage line, and selling the plant for a rental of 26,8931. per annum. The Namur and Liege line is already leased to the Northern of France at a rental of 40,0001. a-year. The report of the Buffalo and Lake Huron line has been agreedto, and it is~ asserted that the traffic will prove remunerative. Atthe meetingoftbeNorth London Company the report was adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum was declared, the taffic exhibiting steady progress. The
report of the West-end of London and Crystal-Palace Company has been carried, and, although the line is opened only to tho middle of Wandsworth.-common, the results of revenPue are satisfactory. The direcU tors of the Boston, Sleaford, and Mdland Counties Company have been authorized to exercise borrowing powers, the report detailing the progress of works having been previously agreed to. According to the accounts of the Whitehaven and Farness Company the revenue wrill aUow a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, on the preference shares, leaving a small balance to be carried forward. The changes in the staff are working satisfactorily, and the receipts present a continuous increase. The dividend of the Whitehaven Junction Company wilL be 7s. per share or 3i per cent. per annum. The report of the South Wales Company has been adopted, and the dividend, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock, declared. The question of the completion of the Pembroke branch is to have consideration, and a hope is expressed that the directors will shortly be enabled to establish a regular communication between Milford and Cork. The shareholders of the North-Eastern Company have sanctioned the report, and declared the dividends as recommended by the directors. The dividend of the Eastern Union Company on the A stock will be at the rate of 3 per cent., and on the B stock at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum. The report of the London, Tilbury, and Southend Company states the further progress of the undertaking, the lessees paying the shareholders 6 per cent. and half surplus profits. The works on the Great Western and Brentford Railway are proceeding, and the prospects of traffic seem to be consideredencouraging. The Buckinghamshire dividend, at the rate of 4 per cent., guaranteed by theLondon andNorth-Western Company, has been declared. The dividend of the Bristol and Exeter Company will be at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, leaving a surplus of 8,7451. At the Wells and iFakenham meeting the report was agreed to, and it was mentioned that the line may be considered almost complete. The Shrewobury and Hereford dividend, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, guaranteed by Mr. Brassey, has been received, and the directors propose to pay it forthwith. The report of the South Staffordshire Railway announces the condition of the line and works as satisfactory, and the dividend will be at the rate of 4 per cent. It is expected that the line of the Stockport, Disley, and Whaleybridge Company will be finished early in the spring, and the directors are now making preparations for working the traffic by the London and North-Western Company. The report of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway is considered encouraging, and a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum has been declared. The works of the Dearness VaUey Company are progressing, hut they cannot be considered in a forward state. By the accounts of the Dublin and Wicklow and Kingatown Railway the balance of revenue appears to be 12,9741., which is proposed to be carried forward and made available for a dividend at a future period. The dividend of the Great Southern and Western Company will be at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and of the 18,0001. remaining 8,0001. will be placed to the reserved fund and 10,1921. to the credit of the next account.
Advices from Naples state that the King has granted to the concessionaire of the Apulian Railway the privilege of constructing the branches applied for in the province of Otranto, commencing with that from Brindisi to Lecce.

The following account of theManchester trade and the Liverpool cotton-market during the past month is from Messrs. Robert Barbour and Brother
" The market here has been irregular throughout the month. The low rates, compared with the cot, at which some descriptions of yarn and goods could be purchased have, in a few instances, led to large operations, but buyers generally have not shown much confideDce, and it is evident that the present high scale of prices interferes with the general demand. Stocks, however, have not materially increased, and prices are in some cases 2.; per cent. higher than at the end of January. The month doses dull, and, though prices are fim, there is great uncertainty and ditference of opinionas to the future course of the market. Theincreased information given in the Board of Trade returns, and the promptitude with which they are now issued, are much appreciated here.
"An advance of , to id. has been obtained in the Liverpool cotton-market during the month. The crop is generally estimated at 3,000,000 bales, which last year amounted to 3,500,000. It is difficult to reconcile this with the fact that the receipts at the American ports are greater than they were last year up to the same period; still it is asserted that this is accounted for by the greater facilities which now exist for biinging the crop to market, the stock in Liverpool, 345,000 bales, compared with 395,000 at the correaponding date in 1856, shovwing a decrease of 50,000 bales.
ti,however, scarcely a fair criterion to compare the stock of 300,000 to 500,000 bales held in Liverpool during the last twvo years with double the quantities which have been en hand there iu former year,. The fact is that consumers are now in the habit of holding much larger supples thanformerly, and also of importing on their own account, so that it may be long before the stock sums up to S00,000 or 900,000 bales, 'which it has done in former years."
The annexed information relative to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the
inimng Jourrnal.-
"Early in the week business in shares was dull, and there was a preponderance of sellers in the market; during the latter part, however, transactions have increased, and a fair demand has since been apparent. At Wheal Owles meeting a dividend of 91. per share was declared, and 1,5751. carried to next account.

MA7NCHESTER, FEB. 28.
The market for cotton yarns and cloths has shown but little animation this morning, and under the influence of a falling cotton-market selers have been more disposed to listen to easier prices.
BIRMING11AM, FEB. 28.
It seems to be admitted on all hands that the iron trade of South Staffordshire is scarcely so active as imiuediately before Christmas it was anticipated it would be early in the spring. There are, however, symptoms of improvement ; considerable orders for the United States and the Canadas have recently been received, and prices of best descriptions of manufactured iron are firmly maintained. The home demand for rods and sheets is also good, and the stocks of merchants throughout the country are represented as extremely low.
Some of the brasafounders of the town seem to think that a speedy fall in the p rice of copper is not improbable, but this opinion is far from being general. In the meantime the uncertainty as to its maintenance or its reduction greatly embarrasses the brassfounding trades. In branches of manufacture not materially affected by the late advance in copper, tin, and leather, there is a fair amount of business doing; but with the founder's work, as might ho expected, is short, and until prices are settled employment will become gradually less. Electroplating is active, and, in consequence of military contracts now in towvn, there is more than usual stir in the old brass button trade.
The reports from the manufactuinug districts are generally satisfactory. In some branches manufacturers are more than usually busy. At Redditch the needle trade was never brisker than at the present moment. Most of thelarge establishments work overtime, and it is stated that with this extra employment they are unable to keep pace with the orders received. The chainmakers in the neighbourhood of Stourbridge and Craidley are full of work, the chief orders being for naval purposes. At Dudley there are some good contracts in hand for railway appelutments, and large tenders for all descriptions of ironongery and ironfoundry required by rai'icay companies are advertised for by several of the largest ostabigshments.
The foreign orders received in the corse of the last few days are, from some countries at least, larger thanthe average at this neriod of the year. The orders for general hardware fromifatansas are unusually heavy, an d to Berbice large consi",nments are in course of exportation. The trade wiith Southr America at the present time is said to ho duller than it was during the latter part of the last year, but the houses engaged in the Italian and East India trades, some of which export largely, have for a month ortwo been well offfor orders. Theroturns of the Board of Trade publIshed on Thursday fully confirm this favourable statement as to the inorease in the amount of Birmingham goods exported to all parts of the world.
The Birmingham Town and District Banking Company have during the present week declared a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 15 per cent, per annum upon the paid-up capitaL.
NOTTINGHAM, FEB. 28.
Many buyers have been in the lace-mark-et, operating extensively for the home spring trade. Their purchases have been of a very general character, extending to almost all classes of goods, but of coarse plain nets and bobbin-net quilling there is a great scasrcity. Several large orders for
etho entd States havealso been received, and theGormans are still buying. The Canadians, after purchasing to a much larger extent than usual, have departed by the last steamers, or are about to leave. Prices are very firm.
The demand for hosiery continues good up to the present time, but prices are now so fearfully high tat great fears are entertained as to its continuanc, especiaUy as spinners have again advanced their yarns 1s. a-bundle. Manufacturers are ourtailing production, maldng only to order. In cases where the full present prices of yarns have to be paid business is altogether unremunerative. The process of working up and working out is going on everywhere, and no one buys yarns at present rates unless he is actually compelled.
LEICESTER, FEB. 28.
There is not much alteration to report in the state of the hosiery trade. Business, generally spealing, is flat, and the operatives are not fully employed. M91anufacturers are averse from creating stock at the present high rates of material. The demand for cotton goods stil continues. In worsted yarns there is no alteration; spiners are, however, working short time. The wool-market is without change.
LEEDS, FEB. 28.
The woollen cloth trade continues in a very satisfactory state. There has not been a large attendance of buyers from distant towns, yet a fair amount of orders has been received, and altogether an average amount of goods has changed hands. The manufacturers are well employed, and have no stocks in excess of the current demand. The opening of the wool sales in London having been attended by an advance in the price of the raw material, an impulse has apparently been given to the demand for cloth, for in the cloth-halls this morning there was an improvement, as compared with last market day. A good deal of business was done, considering the quantity of cloth offered. Goods which can be obtained without an increase on late prices seem to bh readily purchased.
HLIFAX, Funs. 23.
The worsted trade is active, and the operatives are fully employed. Both pieces and yams meetwith fair sale, but the continued advance in the price of wool induces the manufacturers to act with caution. Wool has had an upward tendency in this day's market.
NOB.WICH, FBB. 28.
Favourable reports continue to be made with reference to the manufacturing trade here, and the shoe trade also continues active. Several additional firms have lately engaged in this latter branch of public industry, and placards have been issued stating that constant employment can be pro. vided for more hands at remunerative wages.
The Beccles Silk Works Company (Limited) have commenced their factory, and expect to have thei- machinery in operation by the 9th of June.
DUJBLIN, FEB. 2S.
The Customs' receipts for the week, to Thursday inclusive, were 15,0881., against 16,0341. last week.
BELFAST, Fun. 26.
LLxsx.-In A.rmagh the market was large, but, owing to the late advance in coarse goods, caused principally by the rise in coarse yarns, buyers were cautious and the sales dull. In Lurgan there was rather a small supply both of lawns, birdseye diapers, and dainasks; prices firm. In Ballymena on Saturday there was a dull trade, and transactions limited.
LINEN YARNs.-A steady sale at previous rates.
FLAX.-The supply of flax during the past week has been pretty large, with a brisk demand tor all kinds, at former rates.
COrrox.-There is nothing novel in the Belfast market. Sales of goods continue steady, but not active. Rates are firm. Weavers are pretty well employed, bat those who may be out of work find a ready demand for their labour at farming in the rural districts.

MANOESTEB MECAINICS' INSTITUION A-ND E.X=BMozoN OF INDuSrIAL AnRT. -The 33d annual m eting of the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, and the last that will be held in the old building. Cooper.street, took place on Thursday evening, and drew together, as usual. some of the most distinguished men of the town, mo-t oe whom have been members from the first, including Mr. J. C. Dyer, MIr. W. Fairbairn, C.E., F.R.S., Mr Roberts, C.E., Mr. Fothergill, C.E., and others. Mr. Oliver Heywood presided, and madesome interesting statements in connexion with the progress of the institution, amo.g which may be mentioned its increase in members, the establishment of new classes, and the prosperity of the older classes. The circulation of the books in its library had fallen off for a fewv years through the competition of the free libraries ; but this year there had beeni an increase over preseding years, and an increase in the balance of income over expenditure, leaving a present surplus of 7461. He also mentioned the interesting fact that some gentlemeu who were proposing to establish a Working Men's Call pe similar to those in London, Oxford, Cam bridge, and Nottingham, had proposed an alliance with this institution. their proposition being that the Mechanics' Instituti n should give the use of two rooms in their new building f or the college, with fire and gaslight ; and the college to giva in return free admnission for the members to all their cias;es. He trusted that the proposal would be carried into effect. The proposed classes were for the study of chymislry. history, English literature, political economy, natural philosophy, and the classics. These studies would not interfere with the elementary classes of the Mechanics' Iastitution, while they would afford an opportunity t
such of the members as were fitted' and had the time to carry their studies beyond the linsits hitherto afforded by the institution. An interestrug report read by Mr. RutebinXs, the secrete, mentioned that the receipts from the exhibstion in suppc: of the fund for defraying the cost of the new building ra reached nearly 7,0u01., and would probably leave, after defraying all expenses, the handsome gurm of 4,000?. towards the reduction of the debt. The males taught in the eveninzclasses were n9 in number against 664 in the oorresponding quarter of last year ; and the females in day classes were 301 nganmt 276. High compliments were paid to the secretary-, r. Rutchings, by Mr. Fairbairn, Mr. Fothergill, MLr. MIanchester, and the president, for activity, zeal, anda nbility in the mnasugemnent of the exhibition and of the institution generally,; and the meeting manifeSted its concurrence iu these sentiments by all the gentlemen risig fronm their seats and giving three cheers.

"Mlonsieur le Comte,-Daring your sojourn here yon had Opportunities of closely observing the marks of respeot with 'which the Emperor, our august Master, was received at BIilan, and the satisfaction 'which the presene of their Imperial Majesties gave to all classes of the population.
" The numerous acts of clemonoy which emanated from the Emperor were received with sentiments of sincere gratitude, which more than once displayed themselves in warm demonstrations. If His Majesty in his clemency has deigned to throw a veil over the past, the behaviour of his Lombard subjects authorizes us to expect that the futuxe will not deceive his generous confidence. There can be no doubt that every impartial observer of what has occurred a, MIilan during the last few weeks must share these impressions. Confidenco is establishing itself everywhere, and, if there are still a few spirits who hesitate to join in that confidence without reserve, their doubts originate less in the internal condition of the country than in an unceasing provocating action from without,
"It is especially, I will not conceal it from you, Mf. Ie Comte, the attitude of the Piedmontese Government which has hurt the Emperor's feelings. In fact, the Piedmonteses press, faitlbul to its 'abjeet habits, and to its systematic hatred against Aastria, has endeavoured to represent recent events at Milan in a light diametrically opposed to the truth. The domination of Austria in the Lombardo-Vensetian kingdom, represented as devoid of al legitimate sght, and as the sole source of all the evils of the peniin-
,s@; calumny and insult hurled against every act of the Imperial Government, against the august person of the Em. peror as wei as against his devoted servants; insurrection, and even regicide, represented as the means to liberate Italy from what they please to cal a foreign yoke,-such are the many themes which the Piedmontese journals unceasingly dweU upon in every tone, and which latterly they have turned to account with increased bile and violence. In truth, my pen refuses to relate aU the vileness with which those journals teem; it suffices to open them at haphazard to find abundant convicting articles.
" Considering these attacks, directed with unusual wiolence against a friendly and neighbouring Power, the Bardinian Government, by remaining perfectly passive, has, at the very least, laid itself open to the suspicion of not having wished to discountenance them. This is not all. Appeals addressed to foreigners, with a view to induce them to join subscriptions publicly opened to strengthen the de. fensive system of Piedmont, which is not menaced by any Power; the official reeeption of pretended depatations from oar Italian provinces to express their admiration for a policy disapproved by their own Government; finally, the acceptance of a monument, offered, it is said, by subjects of the Emperor to commemorate deeds of the Sar. dinian army,-aU these are so many offensive demonstrationsr which, however calculated upon the too easy credulity of the public, nevertheless have their serious a pect.
"H How is it in fact to ba explained that a Government which reaUy wishes to keep up relations of friendship and good neighbourhood with us should not have regarded is as concerning its own dignity to prevent demonstrations which Impart to the peculiar circumstances attending them a bear. ieg so palpable and so directly hostile to a neighbouring Power? Is it, then, by allowing the reminiscences of the war and the revolutionary passions which it engendered to bh, continually, publicly proclaimed and perpotnated that the Sardinian Government pretends to fultil the stipulations of the treaty of peace-the first of which establishes that there shall be henceforth and for ever peace, friendship, and good feUowship between the two Sovereigns, their respective States audsubjects? It maybe repliedto us that the laws of the country are powerless to prevent acts of this description; but we cannoton that plea absolve the Tarin Cabinet from having had the appearance of associating itself by its toleration with the hopes of a party whose rally. ing cry is the abolition of the treaties which have fixed the territorial limits now existing in Italy.
"It is true the S irdinian Government has more thau onceconfidentiallyexpressed to us its regrets and its disapproval of the excesses of journalists. Moreover, declaring itself incapable of taking the initiative in a prosecution, it has often referred us to the courts of law to obtain justice for the insults of a libellows press. But if we were to bring nn action for every libellous article, we might at once establish ourselves as public prosecutor. We do not think such an office is in keeping with the dignity of our Government. Apart from this consideration the objects of the attacks of the revolutionary press of Piedmont are not only the acts of the Imiperial Government, but the very principle of monarchy itself ; they even strike at the roots of ali social order. Should not, then, the Turin Cabinet be the first to defend such important interests, and to avert an evil which threatens as much the quiet and security of its own country as those of other States towards which it has international duties to fulfil ? However this may be, M. Is Comte, the Emperor owes it to his own dignity not toleave the Sardinian Government in ignorance of the displeasure which its proceedings generally have caused him. It will or Count Cavour to inform you what measures he purposes to take to efface these painful impressions, and what guarantees he cani offer us against the indefinite prolongation of a state of things so diametrically opposed to the desire by which we are animated of entertaining such re. lations with Piedmont as best suit the interests of the two countries. Intending to shape our line of conduct in future accordingly, I request you, M3 le Comte, by order of the Emperor, to read this despatch to the President of the Council, and to inform me of the explanations you may receive in reply." " I am, &c.,
" BUOL."
On the communication of the above despatchl Count Cavour sent the following reply to the Marquis Cantono, the Sardinian envoy at Vienna:-
" Turin, Feb. 20.
"Sir,-Immediately on his return from Milan Count Paar read to me a despatch which Count Buol had just addre-sed to him (of which you will find copy annexed), complainin)g of the attitude of the Sardinian Government, and communicating the displeasure which its proceedings had caused to the Emperor of Austria.
" Although I did not hesitate to give at once such expla. nationis to Count Paar as appeared to me fully to refute the reproaclhes of the Imsperial Government, I yet thought it as well to send through you, M. Ie Marquis, a categorical and formal reply to the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
" Count Buol complains of the attacks of the Piedmonlteso press, of the manifestations provoked, it is said, in the other provinces of Italy in favour of a policy which does not enjoy the approval of the Imperial Government. Finally, he dwells upon the acceptance of a monument said to have been offered by the Milanese to the Sardinian army. Making the Sardinian Governmenit responsible for these facts, Count Buol ac*uses it in some measure of not fulfiUing the stipulations o. the treaty of peace concluded at Milan.
"I shall not undertake to justify the national pres; against the reproaches of Count Buol. I do not hesitate to zdmit, not onlly, as that Mlinister says, ' confidentially,' but publicly, honestly, as is r y custom, that it often goes to lamentable excesses-that it attacks the person of the Em1eror in a manner I openly condemn. But wuhat I think I hsve a right to maint:in is that the criticism of the press of ihe acts of the Austrian Government cannot cause it any serious embarrassment, aid that, as regards the attacks ngaintt the Emperor, it would be easy to put a stop to them by having recourse to the means supplied byour laws for the suppression of offences of this description. How can the journals which attacl; the Austrian policy impede the action of the Ilmperial Governlment when their admnission into the provinces subjected to the Empire is rigorously prohibited ? Whatever may be their infltuence in the interior of our country-and that inrluence is very small-their action is null beyond the Tessin. The statement in Count Buol's despatch of the receptioni of the Emperor at Milan is an incontestable proof of is.
" Free discussion of the acts of the Government is one *.F
ihe essential principles of the present political system of Piedonot, as it is of many other States of Europe. We boldly assert that that liberty is attended here with as many ad. vantages and with le.s inconveniences than anywhere else. The profound peace which we enjoy, the dailv increasing union between the country and the throne, proves it beyond a doubt; and, as regards foreign Governments, we do not think it can be niainitained that outr journals are more violent and acrimonious than those of Eiigland or of Belgium. The attacks of the English nlewspapers against the Government of the EmpeWor of Austria were not less violent or less bitter than those in o,rs; tut that did not preventAustria from seeking, vwhena it :iited her interests, an aUiance of friendship with England, and from showing her satisfaction and pride at the good relations established with that Power.
" As regards the attacks against the person of the Emperor, not only do I repeat the disapprobation aiready ecxpressed, but I do not hesitate to expresS the regret I feet that the Imperial Government has not put it in our poweer to use the means to put a stop to them by effidaciously sup. pressiDg them,
" You are aware, M- le Mrarquis, that we have introduced special laws into our code for this species of offences by the press, making their suppression more certain, more severe,
than in any other country where freedom of discussion is allowed. Let Count Baol compare our laws with those of England or of Belgium in this respect, and he wil admit the trath of what I advance.
"The experience, mnoreover, of the last few years ha; shown the efficacy of the suppression. All foreign Governments that have made use of the means supplied by ourlaws to punish attacks made against theirrespective chiefs have seen those attacks punished in a manner to prevent their repetition. The same would have taken place, and would assuredly take place as regards the Emperor of Austria, if his Government had foUowed, or should follow, the example of France or Spain.
" Count Paar, to whom I addressed this observation, stated in opposition the fact of the Eapero, prosecuted for insults against the Emperor, and sentenced to a small penalty. To this I will say, first of all, that in offences of the press the fact of the condemnation of the journal hag much more importance than the amount of penalty inflicted, I may, then, add that the Court may have been lenient' either because it was the first prosecution for an attack against the Enmperor of Austria after a long toleration, or because the Imperial Government allowed a very lon. interval to elapse between the publication of the offensive article and the prosecution. Doubtless, in case of a repeti. tion of t*he offence, and if the prosecution took place at once, the Court would be much more severe, as it showed itself against those journals which attacked the Emperor of the French.
" Count Buol cannot make the Sardinian Government responsible for those attacks unless it should refdse to allow the law to have its course ; but, when it declares its wiling. ness to apply the fuU rigour of the law, should the Government of the Emperor require it, such an accusation appears totaUy devoid of foundation.
" In listening to the bitter complaints of Count Bnol against the Sardinian press, it might be supposed that the Austrian preEs is very reserved as regards foreign Sovereigns and Governments, that it never exceeds the linsiti traced by moderation and politeness. This is not, however, the case; far from it. The Austrian journals, more especialy those published in Lombardy, are full of insults and attacks upon the Sardinian Government, and they do not spare the person of the King and the members of his august family I can easily support this assertion by numerous proofs ; I shall confine myself to calUng your attention to the language of the journals of Milan and of Verona respecting an august Princess, a near relation of the Emperor of Austria-lan. gnage which, if I am rightly informed, led to energetic re. monstrances at Vienna from the Court of Saxony.
" If Count Buol is justified in complaining of the violence of a perfectly free press, which is not admnitted into the Austrian States, what must be said respecting a press submitted to a severe censorship, which spares neither the institations nor the political men of our country, and which circulates freely among us ? In Piedmont, if the attack is free, so is also the defence. Austria, attacked by a portion of the press, is defended not only by the journals which come tous from the other side of the Tessin, but also by a certain number of journals published in the States of the King.
"In Lombardy, on the contrary, only the attack is al. Iowed; the journals there reproduce with impunity the most odious articles of the journals opposed to the Govern. ment of the King, and contain frequently personal insults and insinuations against the statesmen of Piedmont, and create as much disgust as certain Sardinian journals cause to Count Baol.
"But this is not all. Count Buol accuses the Government of the King of remaining indifferent to the warm controversy of the newspapers. Traly this cannot be said of Austria. The articles of the official journals, inspired by the Imperial Government, prove that the Vienna Cabi. net sanctions and directs the attacks against us. After reading a leader in the official Milan Gaszette, the source of which cannot be doubted, and in which the Ministers of the King are compared to Robespierre and Cromwell, we may well be astonished at the bitterness of feelng which the toleration of the statesmen of Piedmont causes to Count Buol.
" But it is not only in the name of Austria that the Im. peral Minister of Foreign Affairs complains of our tolera_ t]on. He accuses it of encouraging the most baneful doc. trines, of undermining the foundations of the throne, and of attessptig to destroy the sentinent of sionarclsy.
" The results obtained by the policy followed by the Go vernment of the King bslie those accusations. Every honest man who examines the actual state of the country ever so superficially must admit thsat the monarchical principle, shaken, perhaps, by the events of 1848-1849, has become gradually strengthened, and that it has re-acquired an immovable solidity.
" The spontaneous and unanimous demonstrations which hail the King in every portion of his dominions, even irn those parts where there is not a traditional link of affection and respect, are a manifest proof thereof. But wvhat proves beyond a doubt the truth of our assertion is the prostration of the [tepublican party. That party, which was notwithout some influence when King Victor Emmanuel ascended the tbrone, has, under the rule of liberty, seen its means and strength gradually diminish, so that it has been obliged to let its sole organ in the periodical press, LItelia a Popolo die a natural deatb,- ithout prosecution, and simply from the falling off of its subscribers. This fact appears to me to be the most eloquenit refutation of the anti-monarchical tendencies of which Count Buol accuses us.
" After having examined the question of the press, which forms the most important portion of Count Baol's despatch, I will briefly touch upon the other points it contains.
" As regarcls the demonstrations asserted to have been provoked in other parts of Italy, we cliaUenge whomsoever it may be to quote a single fact emanating froma the Government of the King with that object in view. The Piedmontese Government having called the attention of the Congress of Paris to the condition of Italy, and having shown the necessity of ameliorating that condition by pacifio and legal measures, its conduct excited,withoutany other provocation, marks of gratitude and sympathy from a great number of per. sons dwelling in different parts of the peninsula. There is nothing in this to entitle Austria to complain. She herself though not agreed upon the means, feels the necessity of modifybig the present state of things in Italy. But she does more than recognize this in words. By the acts she has just done, by those which are announced as likely soon to take place, she has proved by facts that the statements of the Sardinian Plenipotentiaries were not devoid of foundation, and that the approval which crowned their efforts cannot be imputed to them as an act directly hostile t Austria.
A As regards the monument spoken of as to be erected at Turin in honour of the Sardinian army, I may first observe that the Government of the King has nothing whatever to do with it. Some persons having inquired of it whether it would accept a gift from the hllanese, it replied by a distinct and positive refusaL The offer made to the Municipal Council was accepted. The Government could not, and ought not, to have prevented it, as it was made uncondi. tionaUy and anonymously. But if the Royal Government could not prevent the gift of a sum of money to erect a statue in honour of the Sardinian army, meant especially to secord the expedition to the Crimea, it will not allow any feature in this monument to hurt the susceptibility of Austria or her army, nor an inscription to imply that it was erected by Austrian subjects. This assurance appears to me of a nature fuUly to satisfy any complaints of Count Boul on the subject.
" Having replied to the reproaches of the Imperial Minister of Foreign Affairs, I might, in my turn, enumerate the annoyances caused to us by the Austrian Government, from the sequestration * f the property of the Lombards and Venetians who had legally become Sardinian subjects, to the violent and unwarranted expulsion from Milan of one of the m.'st distinguislhed members of the Senate of the kingdom. But I prefer net following in the track of complaints of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Austria, so as not to envenom a dispute which we do not think can prove advantageous to eitber country.
"I cherish the hope that the explanations contained in ihis despatch, of which you will leave a copy with Count Buol, and such further explanations as your knowledge of the views of the Royal Government enable you to give, will convince the Inmperial Minister of Foreign Affairs that, vhile resolved to maintain at all risk the institutions which make the prosperity and the glory of our country, it is no less our firm is.tention to fulfil towards our neighbours, to their full extent, the obligations insposed upon us by international law and by treaties.

Sir John Pakington's Education Bill.
SIR JOHN PAKINGTON'S EDUCO. TION BILL.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-This is another of those well-meaut, but injudicious p2ojeots wvhich have been so often inflicted upon the country of late years, for the purpose of educating the people byA ct of Parliament and public taxation. It is the frait of a compromise between the friends of secular education and of religious education at Manchester, under the sldlful mediation of Sir John Pakington; bat, like many other compromises, it rather disguises than removes difficulties, and leaves what was objectionable in the plans of both parties, together with a degree of obscurity and uncertainty as t; its working which is itself one of the greatest of objections to apractical measure.
The Bil is open to the following objections:-
1. It proposes to tax the inhabitants of cities and boroughs for schools in which any and every form of relif,i.n is taught.
Any system of religion ever known to mankind-Jewish, Christian, Mahommedan, or Pagan-may, according to this Bill, be taught at the public expense, the only restriction being that " if any distinctive religious formulary (that is, catechism) be taught," it shall be taught at a certain hour, and children may be excused from learning it if their parents expressly request. Now, this amounts to an indiscriminate endowment of all religions, and is open to the objections made by Churchmen to the grants to Maynooth, by Dissenters to ohurch-rates, and by Christians to the support of Hindoo temples. The faot that a few leading seculars have changed their principles does not indicate that their more consistent followers wiU change theirs. When Mr. Cobden, some years' ago, in an educational meeting at Manchester, made it an objection to the Mlinutes of Council that they "made everybody pay for everybody else's religion," his applauding hearers little dreamed that they should hereafter see him seconding a plan and attachiag his name to a Bill which do the very same thing. So the Rev. Dr. l'Kerrow, of Manchester, In his evidence bef.re a committee of the EHouse of Commons in 1853, gave the following as his views and those of his party in regard to the principle of the Minutes of Council:-
' It is at variance with the rights of conscience and the interests of pure religion. It confounds truth with error; it supports anything which people choose to call religion; it compels the community to pay to the sunport of doctrines and party operations which they consider to be unscriptural and hostile to civil as well as to religious freedom. It is subverbive of the rights and interests of those denominations that cannot conscientiously receive State support, is driving Nonconformists out of the field of education, while it is extending the influence of those who are willing to take all the public money which they can obtain."
Views exactly like these were expressed in a petition from 60,000 persons in Manchester against the local plan, as well as by ministers and laymen of almost every religious denomination in Manchester, and we may be quite sure these vast numbers of inteUigent persons will not turn their coats because Dr. M'Kerrow has happened to turn his.
2. The Bill proposes equally to tax the inhabitants for echools in which no religion is taught, even though they might be established expressly in competition with religious schools.
It may seem fair to support equaUy non-religious schools and schools of all relgions; but it will be felt as not only a hardship, but an evil by those who consider religion as the most essential part of education to do this at their expense and at the public expense. It is in absolute contradiction to the principle on which the Committee of Council has acted from the beginning, and I can hardly believe that Parliament wil stultify itself by sanctioning opposite rules of action in the Committee of Council and the proposed school committees. Non-religious schools can now scarcely live in England.; but if this BiU should pass they woald probably be established in considerable numbers, and be supported by compulsory taxation. It is certain that the seculars would make the support of such schools a condition of voting for any member of the Borough School Committee.
3. The Bill would be arn additional injustice to all who conscientionsly object to receive public money for religious teaching.
It is known that several large relgious communities, including thousands of congregations, object, as areligious prin. ciple, either to admit the interference or to accept the money of Government for religious teaching. These communitiessuch as can afford it-have schools of their own, supported entirely by voluntary subscriptions and the payments of the children; and the Congregational body has an admirable training institution at Homerton College for the training of teachers. Sir J. Pakington's Bil would call upon the Dissenters (while suppor'ing their own schools without help) to pay local rates, in addition to the general taxes which they already pay, towards schools which teach religions widely differing from their own, and which compete with their own schools. This would be an injustice more grievous and a burden more enormous than churchrates; and it would not improbably lead to a refusal to pay the rate.
4. The bill, while professing to support, would really tend to destroy, the existing religious schools.
Those schools are supported by suscriptions, and managed by committees chosen by the subscribers. If this Bill should pass, the subscriptions would not be required; and persons would hardly consent to pay for the support of schools in three different forms, two of them compulsory and one voluntary,-viz., firstly, by generaltaxes; secondly, by local rates; and, thirdly, by subscriptions. Bat if yoa dispense with subscriptions, you dissolve the very constituency of the existing schools. Strange as it may seem to some, the necessity for active benevolence creates and sustains its own machinery; and if you take away the necessity the machinery will naturally drop in pieces. Men who will remain together to superintend the outlay of their own benevolence will separate when that motive is gone. The committees might, indeed, continue to exist ; but as the work would by law be put into the hands first of the Committee of Council with its inspectors, and next of the Borough School Committee with its staff of officers, and as there need be no anxiety as to fands, it is obvious that the inducement to attend committees, and care for the interests of the schools would be greatly diminished. Basy men would desert a mere nominal and formal duty, and the committees, therefore, would become mere nominal and formal things; and the probability is that many would cease to exist, while there would be no strong maotive to create new ones. If this view should be correct, a greatercalamity could hardly befall the cause of popular education, because the present committees, consisting, as they do, of the most intelligent, high-principled, kindly, and zealous members of seligiouscongregations, both gentlemenandladies, with their ministers at their head, exert aninvaluable influence upon the teachersandtheteaching, upon the scholars andthe parents. We have, in point of fact, at this moment, the two things which Sir John Pakington seeks-namely, local assessment and local management; only now we have the assessment a voluntary one, raised without a breath of contention, and we have the manugement distinctly Christian and benevolent -vvhereas Sir John would give us a forced, grudged, and contested tax, together with a parochial board or secuar vestry to dole it out. Would the change be a benefit to the nsing race of England? Might it not even diminishthe quantity as well as deteriorate the quality of education? F or if existing committees should cease, Sir John Pakington will have cut away the ground beneath his ownfeet; he pro. vides no means of forming new ones; there is not a word in his Bill requiring the Borough School Committee to establish schools. And what signify auxiliary funds if the echool itself should disappear?
5. The Bill would create perpetual contention in lorougbs.
Can any man remember the heated contentions which have prevailed on this subject for the last quarter of a century, in and out of Parliament, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, without feeling certain that the annual election of a school committee must produce interminable strife in out cities and boroughs ? In the first place, the Bill provides that as few as 1 in 100 of the population of any borough may require the mayor to poll all the ratepayers on the qiuestion whether they will introduce the Bill or not, and. if the proposition should be defeated it may be renewed year after year on the requisition of the same small proportion of the inhabitants. It is mnost unreasonable to subject all the boroughs in England to such a periodical invasion of their peace. There is scarcely a p reposition, howvever unreasonable and obnoxious, which might not be carried by a pertinacious minority, resolved on wearying out the ratepayers. Should an aidrmnative decision once be arrived at, the Bill would be fixed on the borough for ever let its working be as bad as it may. Then would arise the yearly turmoil of the election of a school committee, on the Eame plan of election (by Voting papers) as that w hich exists
mu regard to guardians ot the poor, -'a_plJa_n w_hic'h_i_n_ Leeds bas been shown to be open to all kinds of fraud. It
admits of no doubt that there would be a desperate
strugle, sometimes on one ground and sometimes On
anotner. It would be a fight of Churchmen and Dissenters, or of seoulars and religious, or of Whig, Tory, and Radical, or of the more economical and the more liberal parties. There is a curious clause in the Bill which indicates how it may be expected to work. Thevotingpapersare to be collected from the houses of the ratepayers, and any candidate, or any person on his bebalf, may appoint "an agent to accompany the deliverer or collector of such papers." May we not infer 1 chat opposing parties will be formed, each of which will re! tain a set of agents to watch the deliverer or collector, not merely to see fair play, but to influence the voters; and that, to simplify operations, each party will have a list of candidates, and the ratepayers wil be urged to "go the entire ticket," as Brother Jonathan says? Yes, the natural working of such a mode of election will be to create organized parties, and then, after a strenuous and expensive
struggle, to issu in the return of one party exclusively.
All experience proves it. Could. anything better teond to
produce and. perpetuate municipal dissension, to causs school comumittees to act partially, or to dissatisfy a largee part of the ratepayers ? It would bring odiumn on the cause of education itself.
'here are other objections to Sir John Pakington's bil
scarcely less weighty than the above, but I must ask yo n to favour me with their insertion in a second letter.

DONCASTER, Elm. 28.
She weather continues to be remarkambly fine and mild, with hieavyy fogs and dews occasionally. The reports respecting the young wheats are of the maost favourable character, anld all kinds of outdoor operations are progressing: satisfactorily. Most of the farmers in this vicinity, are engaged in sewing oats and beams, and some of them nave their barley laindvery forward. Two such fineBsewingseasons as those
flast autumn and the present have rarely been experienced in succession, and the sol Awa never in finer condition for seed.
AlthoughIi there baa been a little mere atiffnes in the price of the beat descriptions of wheat at the mark-ets in this localty, the trade hacbeen far from active or &x1ensive. Milers and fadtors wil scarcely look at the low qualities of wheat, or those ouit of condition, which latter description continiues to preponderate in the hulk brought forward. The deliveries from the growers have been large, considering that lbs major-ity of themi have been engaged in sowing spring coin, and theme has been no marked disposition evinced to hold for higher prices. Barley contiues to maintain a good quotation, hut, as the melting season is now getting advanced, and thema appears to be no Iilack of home-growvn parein and abandance of foreign, the maximum figure has newv in all proba%bility been reached. Oats and beans have beeni in active demand for seed, but the additional supplies brought forward in consequence has checked the upwArd tendency shown at the commencement of the sewing season.
At to-day's market there wee anu verage chow of wheat in rathier better condition,. The trade was pretty steady at about last week's prices only a few choice samples having obtained a Slight advance, while othem did not make so much as last week. An amnple supply of barley, ineluding many good melting samples, which sold freely at the full currenacies of last week. Seed oats and beans firma, other descriptions heavy, and feeding eats ls. lower. The following are the quotations ;-Wheat, ifs. St. to 22s. per lead of three imperial bushels

A continuation of beautifully dry weather has enabled farmers to employ large numbers of hands in cleansing their fields and preparing the land for oats and barley. A greatbreadth has been planted with beans, and cousiderable progress has been maade in the sowing of oats3 The month having closed, the usual agricultural reports have aupeared rom some of the principal farming districts, and they generally concur in representinig the wheat plant to have thriven with unumal rigour, and of there being at present every indicatiou of an early and plentiful harvest.
At the corn-market to-day there was avery good number of parce's of wheat exhiblted, and the dry weather that harlatelyprevailed ha, much improved their condition. The demaud gave firmness to the trade, and sales were effected on the termscof last week. The best white wheat on offer from the improved state aold at 66s. to 72d. the secondary qualities at fOe, to 66fa, and tha inferior Bamples from 4S. to 60f. Best samples of red wheat fetched from 60a. to fi.. the secondary from f6i. to 60a., and the inferior from 43s. to 56f. There vas a shortness in the supply of barley required for malting, bat as the !nqufry was not extensive former prices were not esceeded, Of the 'ntermediate qualties a good deal was taken off for seed at the last quotations. Good malting barley fetched from 46s. to 5Is., and a beautiful sample of fine-weather barley was refused to be sold at fil
Distillihg sold at 3gs. to 44s, and grinding at 33s to 3fs. There was a brisk demandfor oata for seed, and all descriptions were disposed ot Tartry, old, 24a. to 26s.; new, 19s to 23kL: and Poland ranged from 28e. to 32g.
The fiour-market appears stationary in character at 4s for houseI olds and 45e. for seconds.
A degree of firminess han characterized the corn trade at the local markets. At Abhigdon, on Monday. there was a fair supply of wheat, but little was disposed of, bolders demanding previous rates. On Tuesday, at Alton, the samples on offer were much oat of condition, and high primo could not be obtained; bat barley was a little dearer. On Wednesday, at Huagerford, a great quantity of wheat vas on offer, but trade was dull at about former prices. At Basingstoke, on the tame day, wheat readily sold at last wegeks prioes; the hlghest quotation was 6Ss. At Wauage, also on that day, best sorts of wheat were firm, but inferior declined is. to 2sOn Thursday, at Newbury, the demand for wheat was slow, and sales were generaly made at the rates of the previous week. Best sorts ot barley, however, were fully Is. higher. At Henley-on-Thumes there was a slow trade in wheat at last weel's rates, and all other corn wa,
fully as dear. On Friday, at Wallingford, the best sort ot wheat were 5eadily bought at an advance of Is.; good malting barley fetched high figures. but inferior qualties were neglected, At High Wycombe, on the same day, the wheat tradewas dull

There was a good attendance of town dealers and miMers at this market, butthe sunply ofwheat was not quite so liberaL The tradnactions were at last weeles prices, but, although no advance can bs quoted, stil there has hie.a rather more firmness on the part of holders. Barley was rather brisk, but without alteration in price. In malting the trade was inactive. There was but a limited bauiness in oats at late rates. The following were the quotations :-White wheat, 6Os. to 6LL.; red ditto, 58g. to 60.; malting barley (fine), 42s. to 46s. grinding ditto, 36s. to 39s.; @ata, 21s. to 24s.

LThe local markets cotinue firum, but, owing to a greatquantity of secondary and inferior descriptions being offered, no advance has occurred in prices.

Sir,-The statement of the Guardians of the City of London Union, giving the amount of the frauds of Manini on the rates of the eight parishes of which he was the authorized collector, is published, and shows his deficiency to be 22,4071. Ss. 4d., and I wish to trescpass on your valuable pages to point out the wrong and injustice the decision of the Poor Law Board, to make up the deficiency, involves on the remaining parishes, which collecting their own rates have sustained no loss. For brevity, I cite two parishes only, the rentals about corresponding in amountthe one, St. Margaret's, Lothbury, a sufferer from hanini; the other, St. Ann's, Blackfriars, not. The first-mentioned pays about Is. poor-rates annually on the rental, the latter full 5s. in tbe pound; consequently, though free from loss by fraud, the parish of St. Ann's, already so heavily rated for the many poor i it, will pay five times the amount of St. lffargaretsin Iaking Sip the latter's own defiiency. The rate, Sir, cannot be considered for the poor, and it ought to be for this special purpose equal on the ren,tal of the City of London Union throughout, as, in fact, the maintenance of the poor should be also, without reference to residence.
I am, Sir. sour obedient servant

PROGRESS OF FACTORIES.-The inspectors of
PROGREss OF FACyToRiEs.-The inspectors of factories have at certain intervals, in consequence of orders made by the Hoase of Commons for returns, collected information to enable them to present to Parliament a sort of census of factories. Such returns were procured in 1835, in 1S38, in lg'0, and again in the course of last summer; and the result of this latest investigation, which has been laid before Parliament and already noticed in The Tinses, presents some facts of considerable interest. Between 1838 and 1850 the increase in the number of factories m the united kingdom-cotton, woollen, worsted, fLax, and silkwas such as, if equally spread over that period, would have been 32 per annum; but from lS50 to 1856 ib has been at the rate of 88 per annum. But the mere numerical increase of factories does not adequately indicate the actual increase of production. Between 1838 and 1858 the number of factories increased 21 per cent., bat the amount of horse-power employed increased no less than 58 per cent. In the main, this large inorease is to be ascribed to the extension of trade, though to a certain extent, and in regard to some of the textile fabrics, as carpets, ribands, and linen, it is owine to the application of steam power to work formerly dene by hand. But there is another circumstance to be noticed-one that shows the constant progress of science and skilL What we have just stated is the nominal increase of horse-power, but the real power has increased more; for, owing to improvements in constraction, the steam engine is capable of being driven at a greater force than formerly, and more work is obtained from the same weight of machinery. Thus, to go back only to 1850, anid observe the nominal horse-power then in the factories, and the number of spindles and looms provided to be worked by it. at the same ratio it would have taken a force equal to 175,000horses togivemotion tothe spindlesand loomsof 1S50, but theactualpowerin 1856 was only 161,435 horses, orleasby above 13,000. In cotton factories, in 1850 there were 275 spindles for each horse power; in 1856 it served, on an average, for 315. We have no means of tracing with exactness the effect of this economy of force, because we cannot tell how much of the power at command is employed, and we have no statistics of actual production ; bat it is fair to remark that the rate of incresse in the value of the exports of cotton goods and yarn, for instance, has been greater of late years than the rate of increase of the nominal pov,er available for making those commodities. The nanr.- ber of persons employed is less now, in proportion to the machinery, than it was; bat, of course, the number has been increasing absolutely. It has increased no less tban 61 per cent, since 1838, which is considerably more than twice as much as the increase in the population of the country. The number of men (above 1S has increased 82 per cent., and of women above 13 nearly 6S per cent. Of the labour employed in factories, therefore, a larger proportion now 1s adult labour. 5 he number of children under 13 fell off enormously when the law came into operation which required them to be kept at school for part of five days in the week; and now, although from this circumstance two children would be needed to perform the work that one performed 20 yeaws ago, the absolutenumber of children in all the 5,000 factories of the iingdom is less than it was inl 3 in the 3,000 by which alone returns were then furnished. As to the relative number, compared with the other factory workers, the proportion of children now employed, though it has increased largely in the cotton factories in the last siX years
is still not quite haLf what it wasin 1835. The relative proportion of the hands employed in factories now is as fol. lo, s :-Of every 30 factory workers two are children under 13, 17 are females above'3, and U are males above 13, and of this last number two-thirds are above 18. U1nhappily it is feared that the children who, through this change in the law, are not in the factory, are not at school, and that very many of them do but wait, without istrncton, -itil the are of age to be employed as " young persons.! Sir S
Kincaid, the Scotch mspector, urges, as a check to parental
neglect of education, tliatchildren -who cannot read and write should be made ineligible for factory employfneat as " )oung persons!'until some time later than thcee WhIo Ibva acquired thus much knowledge.

L OND04, rO-4yDA Y, MARCh 2, 1857.
The House of Commons -viU this evening have the opportunity of exhibiting on a colossal scale that devotion to party politics which is alleged by mnany against representative institutions. The vaiue and the amount of the sacrifice happen to have been determined with almost superfluous plainness, and we will venture to say that neither
MOLOCH nor MABDIONx, nor any other conventional
authority, ever received so magnificent an oblation. i Lest the particulars of the sacrifice should be left | to inference, or lost in a generality, they have been I carefillly stated, and descanted upon with the fond eagerness of the devotee standing before the altar of his grim, senseless idol. The character of the British merchant, the pacific and honourable intentions of EHm MAjxsvY's Representatives all over the world, the temper and discretion of HER ]VAJESTY'S naval and military officers, the bearing of the English people generaUy towards aU foreigners, but especially heathens and semi-barbarians; our dearly purchased character for humanity, and our much questioned claim of freedom from territorial ambition; our pretence of law and equity in particular, and, as mere trifles thrown into the pile, the character of a company of merchants who for many years have endured the most insulting denial of their just rights, the reputation of a civil servant whose only aleged crime is excess of patriotism, and of a naval officer whom everybody is anxious to speak well for,-all this, and more, had we only space to write it down, is already heaped up, and, if the House of Commons only gives the word, is this evening to be converted into dust and ashes, smoke and stench, for the honour and glory of Faction. The foul goddess is even now exalting her dishonest brow over every consideration usually dear to an Englishman, and it requires little imagination to hear "the tomtoms," and see the " peacock's feathers," and, other pomp and jugglery which one of her principal votaries conducts to her shrine. Hypocrisy and cant rush from their more congenial haunts, and, "from their " places" in Parliament, welcome their barbaric brethren. Our own pettifoggers are delighted to find that even barbarians can argue black into wlhite, make evil good and good evil, and explain away everything that stands in the way of lawless passion. Such is the hecatomb and such the orgies to which the representatives of a great nation are to be summoned this evening. Need we add in behalf of what human object, or person, so engaging, so important, so respectable, as to be worth this huge cost ? England is to be thus gratuitously and wantonly humbled before a nation which, among the least of its crimes, disowns all the feelings of humanity, and all the obligations of justice and trath with the rest of mankind; and which at home, within its owvn impenetrable borders, has for seven years been perpetrating in cold blood a greater aniount of mutual slaughter than is recorded in the history of the world.
Considering the tremendous character of the issue, and the mighty interests at stake, it really is some relief that all the great considerations bearing p-imarily and prominently on the case, or what is generally called the common-sense view of the question, are singularly simple and plain. Should the sacrifice we describe be accomplished, history wiU not be at fault as to its real nature. It is manifest, to begin with, that, whatever may be said as to the virtues of barbarism and the vices of civilization, our position, as desiring free intercourse with the Chinese, is better than theirs in resisting it. It is undeniable that our commerce would, ere this, have acquired a far more beneficial and regular character had this intercourse been allowed. Nay, more, we will say, and it can hardly be questioned, that had the Chinese Government, even only at the date of the Treaty of 1842, relinquished its old policy of exclusion, it would very likely have been saved the horrors of a chronic and endless civil war, and been itself more secure than it is now. So far, both the general int- rests of mankind and the welfare of China itself are involved in a cause which it has been called a " monomania" to care for. These, however, are only antecedent considerations, and are therefore far below the notice of special pleaders who expend their ingenuity on the terms of a colonial ordinance, or the supposed expiry of a reister. So we will advance a step nearer. We will come to the actual position and character, not of the nations, but of the persons immediately concerned in the rupture. They are brought together by an increase of trade in a commodity -which, for a century, has become necessary to the comfort of many miUions here, and the maintenance of many millions there. So far they stand on an equal footing. On everv commercial ground, both as regards the facility, fairness, and openness of traffic and the articles interehanged, it is desirable to have perfect freedom of intercourse, and proper to seek it by all lawful means. But a certain amount of this free intercourse China has solemnly undertaken to give us. For 15 years she, and in particular her functionaries on the spot, have postponed the fulfilment of this obligation, and done all they could to throw permanent obstacles in its way. They have continually excited the populace against us by abusive and calumnious proclamations, published by authority, and have urged the prejudices of the populace, fostered by these means, both to the EMIPEROR and to us, against the performance of the Treaty. They have subjected our merchants, and aU other foreigners thus engaged in a matter of common benefit, to the grossest insults and the most serious inconveniences. Our people have forborne to press for their rights to such an extent that their long patience is twisted into an argument against them. Such is the position of the two parties in the dispute. As for their personal (laracters, Admiral SEYmouR has so many and such distinguished friends to speak for him that it would be quite presumptuous for us to enlist ourselves among the number. Consul PARKES is spoken of with affectisn and admiration by those who know him, even on the Opposition benches. and Sir Joni- Bo)YRiNro went to the East with the most earmest desire for pacific and purely commercial relations. He has been a prominent advocate of Chinese interests and rights. The worst his enemies have alleged against him was that he wished to press on China the fulfilment of the Treaty, as the only means to amicable relations and a satisfactory trade. His patriotism has exposed him to the satire of those who feel more the less simple excitement of faction ; but England has not yet come to tbis, that ofncial zeal shall be itself a crime. Such are the im-
mediate agents on our side of the quarrel. On the other side the principal agent is one of the greatest monsters that ever disgraced humanity. Without the least prejudice, and previous to this quarrel, it was stated that in the course of last year alone he had beheaded in cold blood 70,000 persons on the charge of sympathy with the rebels in a province with a population of 10,000,000 inhabitants. He is uniformly described as a man capable of the most desperate measures, and, even to the Chinese taste, more than usually violent and insulting, yet with all the cunning and btlety so often found in combination with those qualities. Such is the man on the Chinese side of the question.
But the great and notorious facts of the very matter in dispute are quite as plain and quite as much on one side as the nature of the causes and the character of the men. It is not denied by anybody, and cannot be, that the Arrow was a vessel of an ostensibly British character, and engaged in the British trade. It is admitted that she had a British captain; whether up or down, a British flag; whether in full force or not, a British register. It is admitted that ahe *wa,
boarded in open day by a strong armed force, with even an unnecessary display of violence; and the Mandarin employed in the act was shown at the time the British flag by the British captain, and the papers, which he carried off. It is admitted,-nay, it is urged, that certain amends were offered by the restoration of the men taken out of the lorcha, but it is not pretended that such satisfaction was offered as wvould
restore the credit of the British flag before the: native population. All the arguments on the other side, whether in the mouth of Commissioner Y or congenial sophists in the British Parlia-
nient, go from the broad, notorious facts of the I case, into minutia-into subtleties and formalities. YFm argues, not that he had made a mistake and was sorry for it, but that a British flag, employment in the British trade, and a Chinese captain or owner living at Hongkong, under British protection, did not constitute a British vessel. It is plain, from the very line of his defence, that the boarding of the Arrow was a deliberate plan to nullify the clause of the Treaty extending British protection to certain classes of vessels and men not wholly British in the first and full sense of the word. As Chinese fraud and obstinacy had so far successfully evaded one part of the Treaty, so YEH was steadily bent on evading another part, and putting an end to the employment of native vessels and men protected from his violence. The desire was natural in such a man, but we trust the time has not yet come when an utterly factionized Legislature will second the scheme of a barbarian for the evasion of a British Treaty. If it does so, the first man to despise that Legislature, to laugh at its credulity, or, on better information, to recognize the factious sophistry which played into his hands, will be Yaw himself. That be0ore long he would find he had little cause to rejoice we can well understand, for the politicians who have taken up his cause would, consistently enough, prosecute, without justice, what they call an unjust quarrel. But what becomes of British honour in such an event ? The jealous and evor watchfui world would only have one more proverb against us dralwn from our owvn admissions, and out of our own mouth we should be condemned.
The long looked for Coalition has, it seems, at
The long looked for Coalition has, it seems, at length taken place. It is no secret treaty, no convention for a linited or temporary object, but a real political combination of the kind which England was declared not to " love," duly announced by the leader himself on the eve of a great party contest. We are informed by an Opposition print that the Conservative members of the House of Commons assembled on Friday at the house of Lord DERBY to hear a statement on the present aspect of political affairs. On this occasion his Lordship indic;ated in no doubtful terms that an alliance with Mr. GLAnsToxx had been concluded, and that the united forces of Conservatives and Peelites would act at once and with vigour against the Government. True, Lord DIEBY had " never " seen Mr. GLADSTONE on the subject," but it required little discernment in his hearers to perceive that common sympathies and common policy would, in the opinion of their chief, unite the two sections on the coming events of the Session. Lord DERBY passed an eulogium on the talents of Mr. GLADSTONE, and, observing that the Conservative party was at present in a minority in the House of Conmuons, " insisted that nothing could possibly "be more unwise than to decline such accessions of "strength as would place it in a position to under"take the Government of the country."
We cannot feel surprised at this new shift of the Opposition leaders. It has been impending from the first night of the Session. It had, indeed, been long evident that the party headed by Lord DERBY embodies no intelligible principle. Protection is dead, and the theories of the Liberal party have been adopted so universally as to seem mere commonplaces to all who do not remember how long and how bitterly they were opposed by one of the factions which now aspire to power. The Conservatives can only deal in vague generalities, such as their desire to uphold the Constitution in its integrity, to advance with caution, to remedy proved abuses while deprecating reckless legislation, and other phrases of the same kind. What their conduct in office would be we know from the experience of 1852. After a few hustings speeches about Protestantism and principle they would hurriedly throw away all their Cor-ervatism and endeavour to win the popular favour by passing measures which their own opposition had prevented Liberal Governments irom carrying through Parliament. Al this has been for nearly five years so evident that both in the House of Commons and the country the efforts of the Tory chiefs have been productive of hardly any effect. When the Government of Lord ABERDEEN feU there was no thought of placing them in power, and even their own supporters have not had sufficient confidence in them and their prin ciples to support them seriously in any attack on the Government.
To the want of an intelligible principle must be added, as a cause of weakness, the want of a leader on whonm they could all rely in the House of Commons. Mr. DisBAELi has clung to hIs leadership with desperate tenacity, and his party, after in vain putting up one scion of aristocracy after another as his rival, have acquiesced discontentedly in his pretensions. But they could not but feel how muchl they had lost by having alienated the select band who abjured Protection in company with Sir ROBERT PEEL. blr. DISRAELI had, indeed, avenged the Protectionists of their enemy ; but, as is generaUy the case, vengeance has brought retribution on itself. The Peelites, rejected and taunted, have been strong enough to prevent the triumph of their formaer friends and to bring discredit on the assailant of their former chief. When Mr. GLADSTONE overthrew the financial scheme of the DEBsnY Cabinet Mr. DLSRAELI may have recognized the NEwESIS of 1846. However, the Peelites, if they retaliated the injuries they had suffered, were not the less in an unhappy position. They were too mucll like the bats in the fable, hovering between Whigs and Tories, and trusted by neither. Their failure during the war went far to destroy the highest reputation they possessed, that of administrative capacity. It was also painfuUy evident that they were deficient in a certain strength of resolution which is requisite for statesmen, and above all for English statesmen. No genius or eloquence or logical subtlety can mal;e people forget that in the crisis of the ]Russian war Mr. GLADSTONE sounded a timid note. From that time to this the Peelite leaders have been under the cloud of unpopularity.
However, it seems to be thought that a combination of weakness will make strength-that a Coalition of unpopular factions will make a stable Government. Mr. GLADSTONE and Mr. DIssRAFr, each unable to command the confidence of thelHouse, are by their union to overthrow the Mlinistry which carried a great war to a successful conclusion, which has sustained the honour of the country in the Conferences which have followed, and under whose rule the nation has been restored to the high place in the eyes of Europe from which it had temporarily fallen. What success such a scheme will have remains to be seen. For i our own part, we can only anticipate that the
dictum which MTr. DisnLIt once rendered popular will prove to be true in the present instance. If " England does not love Coalitions," she will certainly have little affection for one which does not
even claim to be founded on principle, and is only the last resource of two cliques ofc disappointed politicians.
From the Second Report of HER MAJESTY'S
From the Second Report of HER MA1AjmsT'S Civil Service Commissioners, recently presented to Parliament, the public may learn three simple things of very great interest- -first, the nature of the information required in those who wish to gain appointments; secondly, the extent to which this information is actually acquired as things go ; and, thirdly, the results of the competitive system, or system of opening appointmerts to the best proficients, in so far as the evidence before us discloses them.
And, first, as to the nature of the knowledge which it is requisite to obtain for admission to situations in the civil establishmenits of the country. Nothing can be more simple, more elementary, or more easily attainable than the instruction in questioll; in fact, the wonder is how anythinag ike a proper education can fail to supply it. Of course, there is a great variety of situations, and a corresponding variety of qualifications required, but for a great number of these, comprising the humbler daties of the service, nothing muore is necessary than what any father of a family possessing a tolerable education himself might teach his own children by his own fireside. It is only asked that the candidate should be able to write well, to spell well, to show a certain knowledge of arithmetic, and to express in writing what he hears from dictation or gathers from materials set before him. There is really not one of these qualifications beyond the reach of any lad of ordinary ability. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are taught at ev ery kind of school, and the power of putting ideas down upon paper is one which is almost sure to follow upon practice. When the value and importance of the situation sought rise higher in the scale, the qualifications exacted rise higher also, but in almost every case the particular acquirements which we have mentioned, and especially that of fluency and correctness in writing, occupy a pronminent place. Afterwards come branches of knowledge not quite so commonly accessible, but stil not at all out of the way,-history, principally English; geography; a foreign or ancient language, say French or Latin; mathematics, and, in certain departments, certain qualifications specially applicable. Such is a general view of the information required.
When we say that this information is found to be but imperfectly possessed, we shall be making a statement both encouraging and discouragingdiscouraging to those who may have hoped for better results of national education, as it has actually advanced-encouraging, at all events, to those who have an eye to appointments, and who thus learn the present lowness of the standard in use. The Commissioners find no proficiency satisfying even their moderate expectations either in writing or in English composition ; indeed, they have been compelled to regard the latter subjecb as one requiring great allowances ; and the rejections of candidates mainly for deficiencies in spelling or arithmetic, or both together, were more numerous last year than in the former period. As for history and geography, we content ourselves with transcribing two extracts of actual examp'es. "To remove," say the Commissioners,
" Any possible impression that we may have in these decisions assumed too high a standard, we think it right to state that some of the answers in history which were pre. sented to us in the papers of the rejected candidates were such as these-viz., that ' the Star Chamber consisted of 12 miembers, whose business it was to invent torments for the prisoners whom they thought was against the safety of the country;' that trials of ordeal were employed in the trial of Warren Hastings, and were legally probibit2d in the reign of George L; that George IL is the Sovereiga to whom the name of ' the English Justinian' has been sometimes applied; that Marlborough fought a battle against the Spanish Armada, and completely destroyed it (15S8) in Elizabeth's reign (1558 to 1563); that ' William the Conqueror was a King who introduced many good laws into England, learning and all sorts of science flourishing under him;' that ' Marlborough brought a great portion of France under the subjection of the British Crown; that Hotspur was the principal leader of the army in the reign of Henry VIIL (1509); that Richard IL was a bad King, who, after arrang. ing the Peace of Versa:Ues, entered into a secret treaty with the King of France, and was altogether a lover of foreigners in preference to his own countrymen; that William the Conqueror was ' a passionate man, rather inclined to tyranny, much beloved, however, by his subjects, a kind father, and a faithful husband.' that the RPoman walls in England were built to keep the Tartars from invading the country, and were so thick that two carriages could ba driven abreast ; that the great plot which was discovered in the year 1G78 was the South Sea Scheme; that William Wallace invaded England in the reign cf Henry VIII. ; that the battle of Salainanca was fought against Spain in 1794 ; that the battle of Barnet was between Cromwell and Charles I., Culloden between the Earl of Leicester and Edward the Fourth, and Marstonmoor between Bruce and Edward the Fourth ; that in the Seven Years War the Danes were opposed to the Britons in consequence of the massacre of the former, Sweyn gaining the victory and being crowned King of England; that the Thirty Years' War was that betwveen England and America, in consequence of the unjust taxation; that the War of Succession wasthat between the Pretender and George the First; that Bannockburn was a battle in which the Scotch were defeated, and Marston-moor a contest between the Roses; that Henry the Eighth divorced Catherine of Arragon in order to marry Lady Jane Grey, &c.
" The examinatiuns in geography furnish singular instances of ignorance in the rejected candidates; among these are some who place the Alps in Hungary, Swansea at Norwich, London in the Wash, -Marseilles upon the Rhine, ,nd Germany in the Caspian Sea; who make the Thames to rise in the German Ocean, and the River Cary to flow by Taunton and Exeter into the Mediterranean; who state that Zante is the kingdom most recently added to Europe; and who fill up an inverted outline map of England, so that the Isle of Wight becomes a part of Scotland while the English Channel separates Northumberland from France; or who are not able to say anything about the position of the Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees, Mount Sinai, Mount Hecla, Leipsic, Barcelona, Athens, the Red Sea, the Black Sea, the Volga, the Euphrates, the Gangeq, the St. Law. rence; could not mention the principal manufacturing districts of EDngland, nor state what countries produced cotton, tobacco, tea, mahogany, sherry, or currants, &c."
The mistakes in orthography make a terrible show, being regularly tabulated into a kind of index, like proscribed books at Rome. One word" stretch," seems to have been as great a puzzle to candidates as " PsycHr" was to JAC; BcRAG, no less than eight shots having been fired in vain at this unapproachable mark-" sreatge," "stretge,"
a stregh," " stretgh," " streag," " stredgh," "stredge," "streech." The real crex, however, was the word Mediterranean, which was spelt in fifteen differentways-all wrong.
From these specimens our readers will observe, we hope, not merely the lack of information occa-
sionally prevailing-for the Coiimmissioners themselves, notwithstanding these expositions, express their gratification wvith several features of the general results,-but the room which exists for improvement and the road which is open to success. At this point, and for the benefit of young students, we beg to interpose a few remarks of our own. We are convinced that the chief part of the deficiencies discerned in the more elementary subjects of examination, such as spelling and composition, arise entirely from the want of a steady and practical application of the knowledge acquired at schooL Every boy at school is, or should be, taught his own language sufficiently to be able to read and speak it, and, as he is also taught to write, he naturally should, by the simple combination of these two acquirements, be able to write English tolerably. How is it, then, that this qualification, which ought to be so common, is found to be so rare? Because people do not read and do not practise. Nothing but reading 'will teach spelling. It cannot be
learnt flom a spelling-book or dictionati 'the best memory in the world might fail in such a task. It can only be learnt through that habituation to standard forms which the eye acquires from constant use,-through that familiarity with the look of every word which reading communicates. If a practised hand in these respects gets accidentally bewildered between two forms of a word, he writes them both down, and his eye tells him at a glance which is the true one. At the same timae, too, that reading does this, it will do more. It will convey freedom and ease i in writing, and, if practice is added, the whole
end wil be gained. Why can people talk more readily than they can write? Because they are always talking and seldom writing. Let any man accustom himself to expressing his ideas with his pen as well as his tongue, and he will soon get over all difficulty in what is called " English "c omposition." It must be understood that what is usuially required under this term is not a piece of that intellectual constructiveness which is shown in writing an original essay, but simply the power of expressing on paper instead of by word of mouth certain information of which the writer is presumed to be in possession.
With respect to the competitive system, the Commiasioners make a favourable report of their experience, and, although they admit that the system is as yet in its infancy, they anticipate good results from an extension of its opportunities. For ourselves we regard fiis question as lying in so very small a compass, and being so transparently plain in character, that we are not disposed to waste arguments upon it. How, in short, is it possible that examiners deputed for the purpose, and employing the best known means without any extraneous bias, should not make a better selection of candidates than patrons open to bias, and employing, as must be presumed, no means at all? Even in the examinations which are not actually competitive there is a good element at work, both for the public service and for the general body of competitors. If out of 100 candidates nominated for appointments G0 or 70 only awe pronounced qualified, the rejection of
tne others at once opens the field of nominations to I So or 40 more, so that, while the several departments obtain better servants, well qualified candidates obtain a greater number of chances. In all respects, indeed, such a scheme ought to work for the advantage of the country, and not the least of the benefits resulting will be found, we trust, as the Commissioners themselves anticipate, in the general improvement of education which the application of this stimulus will promote.

Mr. Merry, ironmaster, who has started in opposition to Mr. Buchanan, met the electors to-day for the first time. The meeting took place in the Trades-hall, which was crowded, a large portion being spirit-dealers, who support the candidate in the hope that he may be able to relieve them from the pressure of Forbes Mackenzie's BilL Mr. William Gilmour, a retired magistrete, was called to the chasr.
Mr. IMERRY said he was favourable to giving the iranchise to every man who paid taxes,-in other words, that he would vote for universalsufflrage. He stated that he did not understand the currency question. and was disposed to leave matters as they were. He was not disposed to disturb the grant to Maynooth, and le would relam the provisions of Forbes Mackenzie's Act, and assimilate the liquor traffic to that of England. He would support Lord Kinnaird's Bill for increasing the remuneration to schoolmasters, but would not agree to a compulsory system of education. He would support a Bill for the abolitioa of truck.
Mr. BNiE, a town-counciUor, seconded by Mr. Ross, a cabowner, moved, " that Mr. Merry was a fit and proper person," which was put amid great confusion, cheering, and hissiDg.
The meeting was a very stormy one, and several groups almost came to blows. The canvassing goes on with great keenness. _

During the swunier of 1I55, in Juno or July. zhere lay near our chop, wbich is clone to Her Britannic Majesty's Vice-Conoulate at Whampoa, from 10 to 15 lorchas engaged in smugglmng salt, and eight or 10 of this number hoisted British Dagv during the day, the sail being dicLoarwed at night. The number of vesees was thus large at that time, in consequence of the mandarin hoats having been sent above Canton to repulse the rebels; but the Government could not keep ignorant of so bold a matter long, and 12 or 15 mardarin boats, each containing upwards of EO men, made tbeir appea-ance one morning soon after sunrise and captured the whole ltet, fire or nv of which had Britih Dlsgs flying at the time, the Europeans (general a captaiul as well as the Chinese jumping overboard and swinnming to the different vessels for safety, several of whom carse oni board of our vessel The mandarin force took the captured tleet w Cant3n, and the parties having the right to fly the flag subsequently claimed their vessels, which were eventuaDyreturned, and the remaluderratatned for the Government Thinis by no means an ilsated case aregardsthe illegal ume of the tiag, as yotu have only to refer *o the Hongkong papers to find plenty of cases where the naht was questioned to grant the flag. as it had been done by the Hongkong authoritie3.
But as regards the present troubles. to prevent aDy misuncderstanding of my vievs, I with to express my opinion, that the duty of the Home Government to support the sermants of the Crown engaged in China to the fullest extent should uor be caUed in question for a noment, or until a sati3factorY termination of the preEent diDl. culties, at least; for in race of a suspension of hostilities by the Government it would be an impostoihty for Europeans to live in the vicnity of Oarnton, and no amount of negotitions could alter it for the better. Anyone who ha3 lived smong the Chinese can testify to the continued insults atd injurie heaped upon foreigners whenever an opportunity offers, and the studied contempt shown on all occasions, eunerinduced by fee ings of superiority entertained by the Cantnonse in cortradiistiction to al the other ports in China, all of which bas been brougbt about by the previous settle. ment made with them, or, itL otter words, the want of an applicatilcn of physical power to convince tbem of their position; and although we are pecuniary sufferers to a very great extent in consequence o.
theEe troubles, we should prefer to suCfer stil more than see anysettl. ment which did not involve the necessity of the Chinese realizing their position and a sufficient guansutee for the liberty and safety of foreign residents while am7rng them.

The trustees have already considered and adopted some general rules to govern their own proceedings. These are as follows :-The rules which the trustees debire to lay down to themselves in either making purClases or receiving presents is to look to the celebrity of the person represented, rather than to the merit of the artist. They will attempt to estimate that celebrity without any bias to any political or religious party. Nor will tbey consider great faults and errors, even thongh admitted on all bides, as any sufficient ground for excluding and portrait which may be valuable as illustrating the civil, ecclesiastical, or literary history of the country. No portrait of any pers,.n still living, or deceased lecs than 10 years, shall be admitted by purcbase, donation, or bequest, except only in the case of the reigning Soveseign, and of his or her consort, unless all the trustees in the united kingdom, and not incapacitated by illness, shall either at a nmeeting or by l6eter signify their approbation.

Lord Derby And His Friends.
LORD DERBY AND HIS BrIENDS.
(From the Prcss.)
The Conservative members of the Hosse of Commons assembled on Friday morning at the mansion of Lord Derby, in St. James's-square, to hear a statement from the noble earl on t he present aspect of poLtical affairs, and especially on the position of the Conservative party. About 160 members of the House of Commons were present.
The noble earl com menced his address by allusion to the conrse which a few members of the Oppositon had thought it consistent vith their duty to adopt on occasion of the recent division in the House of Commons upon the Budget. Lord Derby stated that the course pursued by MIr. Disraeli had been concerted with him, and had met with his ertira approval.
Lord Derby said that he had heard it stated that the amendment moved by the hon. member for West Norfolk originated in a feeling of disapprobation at the report which had been cirulated of the coalition betveen the party which the noble earl was proud to lead, and the right hon. ypnber for the Univerbity of Oxford. That report was total3'fa se. He had never seen Mr. Gladstone upon the subject, nor bad he ever held the slightest communication with him npon it. But the noble earl in the most dignified and emphbatic man. ner declared that sbould a. ny member of the Conservative connexion attempt to dictate tohim.the course he should pursue with regard to any political personages whatever, he wc.uld regard such dictation as an insult, and no longer recognise that member as attached to his party. This declaration was received with long continued cheering.
The noble earl said that no one could be more opposed to coalitions effected in defiance of political principle tban himself; but that when members from identity of sentiment wvere frequently drawn together to the same lobby it was itpossible to doubt that a bond of political union was established which no party could refuse to acknovwledge.
LordDerby said that an impression appeared to prevail in some quarters that the interests of Protestantism might suffer in his hands. The noble earl referred to his past career, no less than his well-known principles, in refutation of such a suipposition.
We must not omit to state that Lord Derby exrressed high admiration of the talent. and character of Mr. GladEtone. He noticed emphatically the fact that the Conservalive party was at present in a minority in the House of Commons, and insisted that notbing could possibiy be more unwise than to decline such accessions of strength as would place it in a podition to undertake the Govern. ment of the countrv.
In reference to the important subject then before the Ilouse of Commons, Lord Derby expressed his entire approval of the resolution moved by Mr. Cobdem It wa. substantially the same as the motion he had introduced in the House of Lords, and had supported with all the earnestness of conviction and all the ability he possessedL
After Lord Derby resumed his seat the meeting was addressed by several "*representative men" of the House of Com mons. Mr. Spooner was received with the respect due to the consistency of his political career and the sincerity of his religious convictions. He spolre with generous warmth, denouncing the pretended zeal of Lord Palmerston for Protestantism, and expressing his entire confidence in Lord Derby as the head of the Conservative party. Mr. Newdegate expressed equally loyal sentiments, and with equal warmth.
Lord March, as the head in the lower House of the grea' house of Lennox, and a representative of the landed interest, was listened to with great attention. He declared that his confidence in Lord Derby was so complete that whatever course he might deem it expedient to pursue would receive his cordial, earnest, and disinterested support. This declaration was received with rounds of cheernh.
Colonel Gilpin, an independent member of the Opposi. tion, not only declared his entire confidence in Lord Derby, but expressed his high sense of the services of Mr. Disraeli as leader of the Opposition in the lonse of Commons.

THE Sr=EKs AT THE BxanBsxuEAD UocKwou.Ks.-A company of the 25th Regiment arrived at Birkenhead ou Saturday morning at half-past 3 o'clock, by special train from MIanchester, the officers in commnand being Captain Gildare andLieutenants Pierce and Goodall. They proceededat once to the Town-hall, where they remained until about half-past 12 this afternoon. It was then decided that they should march to the works, that the nen men should proceed with the operations, and that extreme measures should be adopted if it were found necessary. Mr. larden, judge of the Birkenhead County Court, and Xr. Bryans, luaistrate, accomnpanied the troops. The particular work consists in deepening the great float, in which considerable progress hsalready been made. It may be stated that the real cause of the strike is a question of wages to the cla5s of labourers termed "waggoners," who are at present paid 2s. 9d. a-day. They contend that this is lower than the puice paid elsewhere ; and that now the long hours are setting in they ought to receive 3s. a-day. One of them complained bitterly that it had teen reported that they had struck against the employment of Zrighshien, and the consequence would be that at all the great railway and other works in Cuinberland and Yorkshire the Englizh navyies would, probably, strike against Irish labourers, and thus & large number of men would be thrown ouu ,f work. On the other hand, it is asserted on the part of Messs. Thomson, the contractors, that the men are paid quite as high as the sme class of labourers on the Liverpool side, and higher than in other parts of the country; that as thelays get out they are graduallv raised in their wages aceoibhng to their worth; and that if they had continued at work very few of them would soon be receiving less than 3. a-dav. It is asserted further that there are only now, out of L-1-> or 1,400 men, aboat 160, and certainly not more than 20W whoare receiving as little as 2s. 9d., the remainderreceiving 3., 3s 4d., and 3s. fdx a-day.

PARIS, FRIDAY, Fim. 27, 6 P.I.
The French and Turkish Miuiisters at Teheran liave received inatructions to support England in -her present difference with Persia. The former, in particular, has, I understand, been charged by his 'Government to urge on the Shah the necessity of -ratifying the treaty which has been negotiated in. Parls, and the draught of whichhas beeni submittedto -the English Government, and otherwise to co-operate 'to the utmost of his power towartis the satisfactory -solution of the question. If Russian influence be -not uppermost when the treaty is received at Teheran it will be ratified; if otherwise, the chances are, -as I have already mentioned, agaiujst us. Inthe mneantime it is stated that an armisticehas been agreed on between the officers commanding the :British troops in Persia and the Persiau forces. The armistice will be in force for three molnths, and will -date from thle 1st of March. Ttiree months would be about the time for the treaty to reach Teheran, and an answer to be received.
Havilng alluded to the convention said to have been concluded between Russia and Persia on the 18th of January, I may again notice the fact, which .has not been denied, of the visit of a general of engineers, accompanied by other officers of the same -arm, to the country about Mount Ararat and the pass of Bayazid, and of their having examined andI -taken plaus of it, no doubt with a view to the erection of forts. The object, as averred, was simple curiosity or harmless study of topography-as harmless, no doubt, as the archneolovical visit of the Russian *ffiLers to Athens before'the war broke out, when
iWng Otho *vas ordered to be ready.
It is aunounced in the Patrie that the Russian Governmenit has recently despatched a memox-andum to thie Rtussian diplomatic agents in foreign countries, iu which the union of the Danubian pro-vinces is said to be as natural as it is desirable, inasmiuch as the population of the two Priucipalities are -the same by descent, by religion, and by language, -and that their union cannot by any means be prejudicial to European interests.
A letter has been received in Paris to-day an-nouncing that the steam sloop Mloreau, on board 'which M. de Montigny, charged witlh a mission to -Cochin China, had taken his pa-sage, and for whose -safety serious apprehensions were entertained, had -anchored on the 7th of January at Manilla, in the Philippine Islands. It was expected that the Moreau would arrive by the 15th of February at Tourane, where M. de ;Montigny was to land, and proceed thence to the capital of Cochin China.
The Neuchtitel affair is not improving, and, from 'what we can learn, aU the parties concerned are in a ,ery bad htumour with each other. The Emperor Napoleon cannot but feel mortitied at being duped 1oy the King of Prussia,
Whose word no man relies on;
"Who seldlom says a foolish thing, and niever does a vise
one."
His Imperial Majesty finds lhe has gone too far in lecturing the poor Swiss, as he took the liberty of doing when he thought he had the Kiug of Prussia all to Iimself, and in .pledging himself to the Swiss that all would be right. He finds now that aU is not right. Then the King -of Prussia is angry that Dr. Kern should have proclaimed in all the " cabarets" of the Confederation that the Emperor of the French showed him his pri-vate and confidential letters, in which the descendant of the Great Frederick was understood to pledge his word that if the prisoners were set free renunciation would follow. These efiusions were of course most amicable, and not a little sentimental, and they bore the impress (so at all events we are told) of being composed in those momenits when the Royalheart is most expansive. Then again theFederal Government isannoyedthatthehopesitheld out to the ,antons are not yetrealized; the Cantons are indig;nant that they are not realized, and feel that they haave been duped; and poor Dr. K;ern, conscious of hanving acted with much indiscretion, and of meriting the charge of overweening vanity, if not of sore serious faults, is worried to death by reproaches, to some of which he has certainly laid himself open. P.ussia has not named her Plenipoten-tiary; until that is done no day can be fixed for the 'opening of the Conferences, and people here begin to suspect that there is an understanding on this ooint between Berlin and St. Petersburg. The Eing is also vexed that the Royalists should, before rthey wvere liberated, have signed a declaration that on their restoration to their country they would abide by the laws of the Canton of Neu-chhtel; and, as might be expected, His Majesty protits by every circumstance to avoid fulfilling his promise, or what wvas entirely understood as a u)romise. The Emperor of the French is nmuch to blame in this affair; the moment the prizoners were liberated lie should, without any delay, have summoned the King of Prussia to keep his word. He wllowed bad taste and no smal1 ingratitude towards ilie Swiss in the begirning; the best 'way of r..deceming his error was to have compelled lis prevaricating " brother" to perform his part of the implied barzain.
The Commander Caraffa, Neapolitan Minister for Foreign Ailairs, has addressed a circular to all the -diplomatic agents of the King of the Twro Sicilies in foreign counltries, directing themn " to contradict, by all mea: s in their powver, the fact falsely announced in foreign journals, that torture is inflicted -on political prisoners confined in the prisons of liaples. Signor Caraffa, in his circular, appeals to the Ministers of foreign Powvers residing at Naples to prove the falsehood of those reports."'
A report has been current throughout Savoy that another Verger had assassinated the Archbishop of Genoa. Tihe fact is not so, but it is true that the prelate has received several anonymous letters, threat-ening him with death. The writer of these letters is a degraded monk, who has since been arrested for -other misrleeds.
The Minister of War at Turin has offered a re-ward of 4001. to the inventor of the best musket for infantry soldiers. The muskets are to be delivered at the WVar-office, with a ticket indicating the name and address of the sender. If he be a foreigner, he mnst indicate a person at Turin to represent him.
It is annoinced that an agricultulral commission is about t) be appointed to devise a Dlan for in-
-creasing the breed of cattle in France. The prefects I througholut the departments have long demanded i asch an io uiry, in order to check the daily increasing diminiution of that great source of food for the population.
I am informed that the Government has resolved iot to grant a concession for the establishment of Transatlantic steampackets until thi month of June next, and that the grant for such a company will mot appear in the budget until next year.
Four cages of sudden death occurred yesterday. -One was that of Dr. Nicholas, of the Kue Roqu6pine, who fell de;ad from the rupture of an aneuri.m as he was descenlding the staircase of a hotuse in which he had beeii to prescribe for a patient; two others were those of working men, who fell dead from apoplexy, one in the Faubourg St. Martin, the other in the Rue St.P,xil. The fourth case occurred at the Grand Opera, where, during the performance of the first act of the {n4gjtnUots, a gentleman in the pit was suddenly struck with apoplexy. He -was carried out and a medical man sent for, but without avail, as his death must have been almost instantaneous.
The Afr'.e;Itcr publishes the average price of wheat in the various markets of France, from which it appears that the lowest price is 22f. 10c. the hectolitre at Ch!arleville, in the Ardennes ; and the highest price ii r3f. 4c. at Marseilles, in the Bouches
du Ehonxe. l'he average price of wheat is this day i27f. 81c. the bectolitre. At the end of last month it was 2Tr. fc. At the end of February last year the average Drice of wheat was 3nf. 39c. tho hectoltre, and in Februiary, 1855, 27f. 17c. the hectolitre.

PARIS, SATURDAY, FEB. 28.
A letter from Parma of the 22d inst. informs us that the previous week the Marquis Pallavicino, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Duchess Regent, proceeded to Milan to demand of the Emperor of Austria the Jiberation of the subjects of Parma detained .in the fortress of Mantua for political offences. The liberation of those prisoners had been already directly demanded of the Austrian authorities at Mantua, but the latter replied that they could not adopt any measure without the orders of their Government. It is added that the Marquis Pallavicino accomplished the object of his Journey, but be had no reason to be satisfied with the reception he met with from CoLnt Buol and others of the Court, who reproached him with the inzgratitude of the Government of F'arma in refusing to renew the Customs union with Austria, and repronched him with his Piedmontese ten-
dencies, reminding him, at the same time, of the| obligations of Parmnatowards Austria, and telling him plainly that the Goverument of Parmna should comply with the wishes of the Austrian Government, even at the cost of great sacrifices. Count Buol visited Parma on the 19th and 20th inst. He was present at a ball at the Court, and he took advantage of the occasion to again urge the renewal of the Customs union, and to insist on the debt of gratitade due by the House of Parina to the Emperor of Akustria.
A letter from Rome, dated the ]7th inst., asserts that the amnesty granted bythe Emperor of Austria has not produced a favourable impression among the statesmen in the Eternal City. The assessor Dandini, a high police functionary, declared publicly that he disapproved the amnesty granted by the Emperor Francis Joseph, and that the Austrian Governmenit committed a great mistake in having decided on sucl a measure not only without consulting the Court of Rome, but without the knowledge of that Government. More than that, the otficial Roman journal, which generally applauds all the acts of the Emperor of Austria, and announces them with much pomp, has maintained the most significant silence oni the amnesty. Count C0lloredo, the Austrian MIinister at Rome, is said to be much annoyed at this conduct, and has complained to Cardinal Antonelli, who immeediately commanded that the amnesty should be published in the oflicial journal. This was done, but without a word of praise or of observation. The writer of the letter adds that Cardinal Antonelli extols the firmness of the King of Naples, and proposes him as a mnodel wortlhv of imitation. It is said, moreover, that Cardinal AntoneUi is not perfectlj satisfied with the appointment of Cardinal Morlot to the Archibishopric of Paris. Prince Orsini, the new senator of Rome, made his official appearance the first day of the Carnival. When the strangers in Rorne saw the municipal conmnillors in their official costume, followed by their servants, they thought they were masks, they presented so ludicrous an appearance.
The Council of State requested the Minister of Finance to attend before them yesterday to give soLne further information respecting the proposed tax on personal property. It is said that the chief object of the new tax is to force all commercial shares and joint-stock companies to contribute to the Exchequer by a payment on the transfer of shares and a percentage on the revenue.
M. Livois, chief of the French missions in China, bas arrived in Paris, in order to give the Emperor full information with respect to the position of the Catholics in the Celestial Emipire.

The arrangements for the holding of the Neuehafel Conferences in Paris have made very little progress sinee I last addressed you on this subject. Eng,land, Russia, Proassia, and Austria have accepted the invitatio.n which France addressed to them in a circular note under date the 9th inst., to instruct their rospective representatives -in Paris to take part in Conferences the object of which is. the final regulation of the position of NTeuchistel, wis-d-s,is the King of Prussia on the one hand, and the Swiss iFederal Government on the other; the common ground for these, the five great Powers of Europe, meeting together to settle this small question being the London protocol of May85, 18a2. The various Governments have not as yet instructed their several Ministers in Paris, and no day is as yet settled when the first Coniference shall be held; but, as Count Kisseleff must by this time have returned to Paris from Nice, and Count Hlatzfeldt ha.s now recovered from his indispositionl, and his Secretary of Legation, Baron Rosenberg, has returned to his post, and the Carnival is over, it is probable that a day wdll soon be fixed. The participants in the Conferences will be excclusively the representatives of the five European Powers, and when a result has been arrived at it will be laid before the SwiS Government for acceptance. The feeble attempts that have been made by the representatives of Switzerland to open direct negotiations writh Prussia have failed, from their not fulfilling the most obvious preliminaries essential to a resumption of diplomatic intercourse. The course which the Conferences will probably follow is thus sketched out in Ministerial circles :-Prussia will adduce the events of last Septemiber as a proof of the necessity of no longer dolayingf the regulation of the- matter, and wrill then lay before the Conferences her proposals towards that end: these proposals will
form the subject of their common deliberations, France acting as the advocate forSwitzerland. WVhat those proposals are was some time since comminicated confidentially to the different Cabinets, a-i I gather from various remarks. Lettersfrom various officieux correspondents of provincial papers here state pretty uniformly that these proposals, if agreed to bythe four European Powers and complied withby Switzerland, w;ill lead to a cession of the Kiu s sovereigrnty over Neuchattel; but probably the French Cabinet has already ascertained and com!municated tothis Court the unwillingness of the Swi's Governmnent to accede to them, for ,SLy in-
formation tells me very distinctly that the King is still very bent on retaining his Principality, and, should any good ground be shown him why he should give it up, its cession will certainly not be in favour of Switzerland. As the subject is not elaborated bere in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but is talked over in the Palace, I am inclined to attach greater value in this matter to Court inforniation than to Ministerial inspiration; but, nevertheless, although I tell you now what the King's intentions and feelings at present are, it will very probably turn out in the sequel, if the matter be not very much hurried on, that he will subseqnently be disposed tf listen to the advice ef the PsF.*ers ussembli? in Cbnference. For the sake of X3$eteuess.} R an extaot from an ois 4.w
article on the subject in to-day's Zelt, which may be relied on as o *rrect:
" The liberation of the Royalist prisoners removed only the causse bei which Prussia had id down, if the rights oI the King should be prejudiced in anticipation by the condeuonation of men who had taken up armns for their very
i:dic.tion. SwilzerlaLd's compliance on that poins settled a preliminary quEstion in the manner demanded by Prassia, and advocated by the other Powers, and thus made it possible for Prussia to recur to the obli. gations she bad undertaken in the London protocol, but in no other way did it affect the main question. In the protocol so often referred to Prussia declared her readiness to leave the settlement of the Neuchltel question in the hands of the great Powers, and, for her own part, to abstain from any steps to this end, she went no further then, and has not gone any further in any subsequent declarations. She has never held out any hopes to Switzerland that in case the Royalist prisoners were released she would proceed to a voluntary cession of her rights. On the contrary, the unconditional liberation of the prisoners was always dernanded to enable her to return to the path laid down for her in the London protocol, and from which a continued resistance on the part of Switzerland would have forced her. If the real state of the case were not as above described, it would be difficult to imaine why or wherefore a Conference of the Powers that participated in the London protocol should have been called to arrange the matter."
The settlement of the question of the redemption of the Sound Dues is approaching its termination much more quickly. On the 17th inst. the members of the Conference met for the purpose of agreeing to a draught of the final protocol which is to record the adoption by Denmark and the other Powers interested of the treaty, a resusm6 of which has lately appeared in several papers; the 23d inst. seems also to have been fixed for another Conference, but whether this latter has been a final one is not yet known here; probably it has not been so, otherNvise the telegraph vould have brought us the news ere now. The definitive settlement of the final protocol cannot be postpoued much longer, as the treaty is to come into force on April 1st, and the Danish Legislative Bodies have yet to be convoked and consulted on the subject; and it is not to be expected that a treaty so distasteful to the nation, and so injurious to its finances, will be accepted without a most lively opposition. The treaty in question settles the main points, that the Sound Dues shall be redeemed by capitalization at so many years' purchase, and the proportion of the redemption money that shall fall to the share of each State trading with the Baltic; but it does not settle how the amount agreed upon is to be paid. This forms the subject of separate negotiations with each separate State. It is only with reference to this last point that it is correct to say that a settlement has not yet been arrived at. The main point is virtually settled * on the subsidliary point, however, even when settled between the States themselves, each constitutional Government concerned must first consult the taxvoting body in the State before it can arrive at a definite conclusion. Though we have no news at present of the treaty for the redemption of the Sound Dues having been actually signed and executed, it may be looked on as certain that it will be Bo within a very few days, and that from April 1st there will be no more Sound Dues to pay. The total amount at which the Sound Dues have been capitalized is 35,000,000 Danish rixdoaars, of which 28.93per^ent. falls to Great Britain's, 27.83 to Russia's, 12.69 to Prussia's, and 3.48 to France's share. The proportion in which the trade of the United States of North America was affected was only 2.05 per cent., but yet it was to the impulse given by their refusal to continue paying the Sound Dues that we are indebted for steps having been at last ta:ken to buy off this impost. Some advices from Copenhagen state that the United States have also signified their willingness to pay up their qnota of the redemption money, in spite of their previous refusal to recognize the legality of the tax.

TURIN, FEs. 24.
It is said that no one knows what he may be capable of Lntil he has tried himself, and certainly the Piedmontese have given a striking proof of the adage within the last three days, fer until the Carnival of this year nobody would have believed that this ordinarily sober and almost morose population could have been roused, as they have been, into the enjoyments of those follies and absurdities in which the Venetians and Florentines and other more sprightly people have long been pre-eminent. So it has been, however, and because a newspaper (the Gczzetta del PopoZo) suggested that an incitement to the amusements of the Carnival would give a fillip to the retail trade, and a number of tradesmen organized a committee and raised subscriptions for making some public shows, society generally caught at the idea, and for the last three days the Turinese, and provincials attracted to the capital hy the bill of fare furnished by the committee alluded to, have been rollicking in a manner that I believe has quite astonished themselves, and has truly astonished every one else here. Strange to say, the only party inclined to discourage this movement was tbe clergy, who are not usually averse from holydaymakimg and idling, but, somehow or other, seeing this proposition coming from the opposite party, they seem to have conceived an mstinctive dread of its tendency to make people enjoy themselves without their being consulted on the subject. The As-ons, therefore, which is the chief clerical organ of Turin, threw as much cold water as it conveniently could on the scheme, and ridicnled the idea of the Piedmontese entering into the humours of the Carnival like their more " spiritual" compatriots of other parts of Italy, but, finding its objections did not stand against the prevailing taste for merrymaking, it suddenly discovered, and produced irrefragable proofs from history of the fact, that the theological tenets of the Conte Verde (about which there never had been any question) were perfectly orthodox, and that he was a devout Papist, and therefore, says the A=nsonw, the " Libertini" are most unfortunate in making him the subject of an historical pageant, because the annals of his life prove that a good Prince should defend the Church, and depend upon the Pope, and respect the canons of the Church, and fear its censure, and that the Princes of the House of Savoy were the most Catholic of Princes. These remarks of the Armonmic in no way influenced the proceedin.gs of the last three days apparently, though, if they had had the effect of suppressing the procession of the Conte Verde (with which the amusements of Sunday began) and throwing the money raised fcr it into anotber channel, it woifd have been a decided gaintothepub]ic,forthepageantitselfwasaveryheavy affair, though commercially, I dare say, it answered its object, as it looked imposing in the programme, and thereby broubght a number of persons together - but it was unavoidably too much of a theatrical display,with the audience aU behind the scenes, to give great satisfaction. This rather dull business ended, however, the more enlivening scene of the " Corso " commenced, and here it seem% first to have burst upon the good people of Turin that they possessed a turn for the comic which has hitherto lain most unprofitably dormant. " Corso" is only a convertible term for what is in London technically called " a park," I believe, but on this occasion it was varied by fancy dresses and masquerading, and on Sunday by some timid attempts at comfetti-throwing. The most conspicu-
ous of the c!araeters wer a troop of Pierrots on horseback and a troop or gozmz of Bedouin Arabs. The latter were particularly well mounted and well appointed, and performed a very creditable fantasia in the square of the castle,where the King and Royal Family were spectators from the Royal. Armoury. Both parties were said to be composed of persons soeially belonging to the equestrian order, and they certainly deserve most of the credit of having put the Carnival on horseback in Turin. Yesterday and to-day have been repetitions of what took place on Monday, with the exception of Conte Verde, who ceased to exist on that day, and with a considerable increase of character each time, and an evidently growing taste for badinage and conjetti, until to-day, when the exhibition would not have disgraced the Corso of the Eternal City itself. To conform as much as possible to the authority of Rome, there has been a procession of masks with moccoli in the streets this evening, headed by an ambulatory orchestra, illuminated with flambeamix. Every night there have been masked balls at nearly al the theatres, the best of which was that at the Royal Theatre last night, when the King was present for a short time in his private box; and I heard it remarked by bothPiedmonteae andforeigners that they never sa7 anything of the kind supported with so much vivacity here. The house was so crowded that for many hours it was difficult to get either in or out, and many people did not succeed in getting i) xt4 oAelovkin tQ VQriing. Betweeaa 5 and 6 thLs
morning an accident occurred which might have beea attended with the most fatal results in such a dense crowd, had it not been for the presencX c,f mind of some of the company. About that lime part of the hangings or festoons with which ihe staircase was decorated caught fire from one of the lamps, and of course the cry of "Fire !" soon spread, and caused great consternation to those within the body of the house, but some one (one of the Bedouins I am told), reflecting that there was nothing in that part of the house inflammable except those temporary ornaments, persuaded his friends to go on with a quadrille which they had just arranged, and called for music, and so saved every one from the dangers of panic and a sudden rush. The effect of this distraction was most successful,-the fire was quicldy subdued, confidence was restored, and dancing continued till past 7. Tonight there are more bals, but they will not be so well attended, and in a few hours all this masking and mummery will be laid aside for a twelvemonth.
The Piedmnontese don't deserve any extraordinary praise, perhaps, for this sudden and unexpected development of humour, but those persons who are constantly saying that this or that people are not fit for sucli and such institutions might &aw a moral from it. Eefore 1848 they always said that the Piedmontese were not fit to have liberty, and when that fallacy had been shown by a trial of nine years they said " Oh ! it's only because of their dullness that thev submit to a Parliamentary Government. The Piedmontese have not wit enough to enjoy a carnival." Now that they have proved themselves capable of both acting sensibly in serious matters and making fools of themselves when occasion justifies it, it may be allowable to answer these critics by applying the proverb I began wvith, and saying to them that it is inpossible to say what any people may be fit for until they have had a fair trial.
SPAIN.
(FROM OUt OWN CORRESPON-DENT.)
M&DRID, FE. 23.
The old Polaco party, which was driven out in 1854, and whose chiefs have but recently been readmitted to Spain, is in a state of great exasperation at the marked disfavour shown to it by the Palace. Some of its members make no secret of their feeling of irritation, and at times indulge in expressions of a somewhat treasonable nature, to the effect that it is tiame to get rid of the present Queen, and to replace her by the Duchess de Montpensier. This must be regarded as a merechildish ventingof spleen, for, however insecure Queen Isabella's tenure of her crown may be thought, it is quite certain that there is no chance of its descending on the head of her sister. Such an arrangement would suil neither England nor France, neither would it be acceptable to the Spanish nation, with which the Montpensiers are not popular. Should another and a more radical revolution than has yet beenwitnessedhere leavethe throne vacant, it is difficult to say who will be called upon to fill it. The subject is not ulfrequently discuissed, as are also the merits of the various candidates. The old project of uniting Spain and Portugal under one crown is not lost sight of ; and some who are favourable to it would, in the first instance, offer the crown of Spain to the father of the present King of Portugal, with a view to its being ultimately united to that of the last-named country on the head of his son. These, it may be said, are rather curious speculations than serious plans. But if the present dynasty is not to last -and it seemns a growing and very general opinion thatit cannot-it is neither unwrise nor unteresting to discuss beforehand what is to replace it. The feeling that things are in a most unsettled state gives rise to many wild conjectures and hypotheses. I believe nobody seriously believes in the possibility of a republic in Spain. Count Montemolin's name is sometimes mentioned, but there are many difficulties; and, moreover, what would France say to that ? The Emperor, it is thought, would do his utmost to prevent a
succession which would give fresh hope and vigour I to the French Legitimists. Those persons-and I I confess myself of the number-who disbelieve that Napoleon III. cherishes the dangerous design of placing a member of his oan family on the throne of Spain are puzzled to conjecture to what his policy with regard to this country tends. It is well known that he has favoured and supported O'Donnell, and it is believed to be in consequence of that support that O'Donnell has maintined the position he has since he left the Ministry. The Queen, it is known, does not like him, and yet lie has occasional interviews with her, and seems to possess a certain weight, unwarranted by that of any party that he leads, for, in fact, party he has none. He lost his opportunity, in August last, of putting himself at the head of the Progresistas, and now he is reduced to be the chief of a small knot of Vicalvarists. Yet it is known that the Palace, moved, it is believed, by French influtence, exertedpartlyanadindirectlythroughMaria Christina, has lately endeavoured to get him into the Ministry. That combination failing, he has been offered the Presidency of the Senate, which he has refused, being determined, it is believed, not to work in any way with Narvaez. But to what end then, it is asked, is he upheld and put forward, and w hat is the mneaning of the preference shown for him by the French Govermment ? It can hardly be with the idea that a Government which he should head or share in would have greater chances of stability than one under lNarvaez. For if,when action is required, O'Donnell has proved himself a man of energy and decision, on the other hand his political changes and vacillations have been so numerous, that if he came into power he would find himself without supporters and assailed by all political parties. Except by the most corrupt and illegal meansit wrould be impossible for O'Donnell to get together a Cortes in which he would have a majority. He would be opposed on the one hand by the Progresistas, on the other by the Folacos; sections of the Moderadoes would also work against him ; in short, he would be harassed on all sides, and it would be scarcely possible that he should maintain himself for any length of time.
There was a grand ball at the Palace last night, the only one this Carnival, and the names of the Polacos were carefauUy excluded from the list of invitations. This marked slight has added fresh fuel to the flaie of their anger.
Senor Gonzales Bravo has taken leave of everybody, and the papers say that he will immediately leave for England, but it is thought not improbable he may remain here tir his election is secure; and it is said that he will return to Madrid to be present at the opening of the Cortes.
It is stated, but I do not vouch for the truth of it, that the Spanish Government has applied to those of England and Fra'nce to know if they will allow their naval forces to watch over the safety of the island of Cuba while those of Spain proceed from that island upon an expedition against Mexico. I am assured that up to yesterday no answer had been received to this inquiry.

The Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.
THE COLLIERY EXPLOSION NEAR BARNSLEY.
LUT\DHLLL, SATURDAY EVENING.
At the date of the last despatch laid before your reader' the shafts of the coliery were being closely covered up so as to prevent any current of air through the pit; and the committee of management, acting .under the advice of the foUlowing eminent coDiery engineers, Mr. Nicholas Wood (of Darham), Mr. Elliot (of 3Monkwearmouth), Mr. Woodhouse (of Derby), and Mr. Holt (of Wakefield), were relying upon the entire exclusion of air aud the accumulation of water in the workings to put out the fire still amouldering in the pit.
The following is a brief riesum7 of the proceedings which have since taken place -.-The engineers above nanmed, with Mr. Morton, the Government inspector, again met for consultation on the afternoon of Wednesday last. At the conelusion of the consuitation, which lasted some hours, Mr. Wood favoured the representatives of the press with a statement of their proceedings. It appeared that Mr. Morton, the Government insoector, had advised theproprietors that the then committee of management, which consisted of a number of coliery managers and viewers in the neighbourbood, who on the occurrence of the calamit had kindly come forward to relieve them of the responsibility of the managemnent, but some of whom had now expressed a wish to be relieved from the responsibility, not all being professional men, were not quite the persons to conduct operAtions of this kind. Acting on the advice of the Government inspector, the proprietors laid before Messrs. Wood, Elliott, Woodhouse, and Holt, a request and authority in writing to undertake the entire directiotL ofthe operations for re-opecing the pits and recovering the bodies, with power to employ, at the expense of the firm, such assistance as they might think proper. Though involvingreat inconvenience to themselves the engineers felt bouna to accept the responsibility. Deeply inmpressed with the necessity of recovering the bodies of the sufferers as expeditiously as possible, and being satisfied of the impossibility of any of them being stiUl alive, they determined to rely no longer upoIn the mere exclusion of air, but to flood the pit with water to such an extent as would fdl the workings where the lire wa., and thus extinguish it. This they considered the most expeditious and the only safe method of accomplishing their object, being satisfied fromthe fact of the temperature at the bottom of the ventilating shaft beinabout 1OO degrees, which is at least 40 above the natuzrl temperature, that there was still a large mass of burning matter in the pit, and that any attempt to descend the pit heforo that was extinguished would be attended with extreme danger. To show the great delay that would occur in the recovery of the bodies if the mere exclusion of air were relied upon, Mr. Wood mentioned that a pit of which he had the management got on fire some years ago; that it had only one shaft; and that, though the air was excluded by the shaft being covered with a scaffolding upon which 30 feet of water were placed, 14 weeks elapsed before the pit could be descended. He had no reason to sappose that there was less fire in this case than in the one instanced. Hence the unanimous opinion of the engineers that a vast saving of time, coupled with increased safety, would result from flooding the mine. It should be here mentioned that, although naturaDly the workings of the seam in which the explosion occurred at the Lundhill pit are perfectly free from water, wsater flows into the workings of a seam nearer the surface, which has been partly oor* at the rate of about 250 gallons per minute, and that on the closing of the pumping and other downcast shaft to exclude air pumping operations were necessarily suspended, and this nfow of water in consequence descended into the lowerworkings. On Wednesday,when the engineers determinedfto flood the nit, the water which had thus accumulated had ahleady reached the level of the top of the worLkings communicating wvith the principal downcast shaft, but had not reached the level of the bottom of the ventilating shaft, whichis several yards higher than the downcast one. To expedite the flooding of the mine it was determined on Wednesday evening to carry into it the water of a brook running near the colliery. The diversion was completed about midday on Thursday, and the water has since accumulated in the mine at the rate of nearly 400 gallons per minute. On Thursday evening it was ascertained that the water had reached the level of the ventilating shaft. and on Friday and Saturday it was found to be rising somewhat rapidly, but was still some distance from reaching the fire, while the temparature,whichaweekago wasatlO5degrees20 yardsfrom the togp of the ventilat'nm-shaft, bad on Friday last declined to (^5 degrees. To-day (Saturday) further experiments have been made, sbowing a further reduction of temperature near the top of the ventilating shaft, while at the bottom of the same shaft it is still about 30 degrees above the natural heat. The temperature of the water at the bottom of the sbaft was SO degrees. The managing engineers, with the Government inspector, again met for consultation to-day, and, after a deliberation extending over several hours, Mr. Wood made the following communication to vour correspondent :-"1 When we (the engineers) last met it was arranged 'hat the pit should be filed with water to a certain extent. We are stiUl pusuing that system. 11othing more can be done until the water has risen to such a height as to extinguish the burning matter. We have ascertained to-day that the water in the mine is considerably higher in temperature than the water which is being poured into it, a fact which shows that there is stiUl a considerable amount of burning matter in the pit, and, we think, justifies us in the steps we have taken. We propose on Monday morning to commence uncovering the downcast shafts and preparing them for getting the water out in as short a time as possible after the extinction of the fire is accomplished." The Government inspector said he fully concurred in the propriety of these measures.
It is expected that the water wil have risen to the requisite beight in the course of a very few days, and preparations are being actively made for emptying the mine as soon as the proper time has arrived. Unfortunately the ordinary pumping apparatus will not be available for emptying the water out of the fiery workings, because it extends only to the workings of the upper seam. It will, however, be put in operation to stop the influx of water from the upper to the lower workings. Two large wooden cisterns, which wil fiU by means of self-acting valves, have been made for the purpose of drawing the water out of the lower workings. They are each capable of containing 500 gallons, and wiU be let down and -drawn up the shafts in large iron cases made for the purpose. It is expected that the emptying of the mine by this means will occupy some considerable time, and that the bodies will not be recovered in less than three weeks from the present time. Trap-doors, &c., are being actively made ready for the ventilation of the mine as soon as descent is practicable.
During the week the utmost anxiety has been manifested among the miners of the neighbourhood for the opening of the pit, and on Tuesday threats were made that a forcible entrance would be effected by a body of them unless speedy measures were taken for the recovery of the bodies. This was reportbd to the proprietors, who thereupon sent for Mr. Green, superintendent of the Barnsley pohee. Mfr. Green increased the staff of policemen at the place, and hiniself took the superintendence. No at.empt was made to carry out the threats, and osn Wednesday evening a body of minerswere caUed into the company's offices, and assured by the colliery eneineers that the most prompt measures consistent with safety would be taken for the recovery of the bodies. The dissatisfaction appears to have passed away.
The most general sympathy is manifested for the bereaved. On Thursday a public meeting was held at Barnsley to promote the raising of fends for their benefit, and dubscriptions 'were announced to the amount of about 1,0001. An appeal on behalf of the bereaved has been put forth in Sheffield by the Mayor (hlr. J. W. Pye Smith), the vicar (Dr. Sale), and other principal officials of the town, and a private meeting will be hela on Monday for the organization of a committee to carry out the object. A similar course is arnounced in other towns, and sermons are being preached and collections are being made at mauy places of worship. The propri.-tors receive subscriptions in aid of the bereaved fund daily.
The adjourned inquest will take place on Monday.

SnAAx's HOSPITAL SocrTy.-The 36th anniversary of this adrmirable charity was celebrated on Saturday evening with mich success at the London Tavern. Lord Stanley oE Alderley occupied the chair, and there were also among the guests Colonel Sykes, Chairman of the East India Company; Admiral Sir G. Sartorius, Mr. S. Lindsay, P ., Mr. Richard Green, Captain Shepherd, Captain Helnedy, R.N., &c. The dinner was ecelleut and well served, aud, the routine toasts having been given and duly honoured, the chairman briefly, bat with much warmth and feeling, urged the cause of the hospital, which he considered was by far the best institution of its kind within the metropolis. From the report of the society, which was banded round the room, it appeared that durng the past year I85t patients had been admitted, whilethe number of onatp-etats tor the same period was 1,658, or 3.509 in all. Sines its foundation in 1821 no fewer than 124.000 sick seamea of all nations have beenrelieved by thesocjety, 78,OOhaningbeen in-patients, and 46,000 out ditto.; of this large -number 6,000 were either wholly or partily clothed eo kaving the hospital-ship; 1,500 were discharg2d to ships fowed them by the henevolent exertions. of the society, and 300 were forwarded to their homes. TFa expeose of fitting ap the new hospital-ship, which had been given to the society by the Admiralty, had beea,boeee almost entiely bythe lands of the charity. This had necessit%ted a beavy outlay, and lunded stock had to, sold out, and tbim at a time when it is most needed the pmersaent income of the charity from that source is reduced 500. per annum, leaving the committee to obtain from voluntary sources at least 4,000. a- |year to meet fe curre,t expenditure. Upwards of 1,0001. was cotribr.ted after the noble chairman's toast, Her Majesty gi fing her annual donation of 10., the Emperor of the r,.nch, 700f. ; the Queen of Spain, 211.; the King of Hanover, 211; East India Cobiupny. 1051.

THE CHINA DESPATCHES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-htr. Cobden, in complaining that the despztche5 which he read to the House had been omitted in tho blue-book, did not mention that they had already appeared. n previous ones-a sufficient reason, one would think, for their not being reprinted in this. I certainly have no reasoni to complain of their reproduction in his speech, considering the way in which they were received by both sides of the House; bat some people might infer that I had supplied them myself, and hence the desire that the fact should be known of theirhaving been returned toParliamentyears ago-
The decision in one House bas sanctioned, and that of the other I hope will sanction, the part you have justly taken in this question. The Belial art of making "the worse appear the better reason" has been rather unluckily applied to exciting our sympathies in favour of the savage Bedlamite Governor Yeh, the butcher of 70,000 of his own countrymen, and the bidder at 30 dollar8 each (5t.) for the heads of ours. The truculent Tartars had never a more hideous representative, and I believe that none but Milton himself ever made the devil appear at all interesting.
Akd then to talk of "I international law " between us and the Chinese ! The law of humanity, if you please-but what have the Chinese to do with the conventional code of " outside barbarians," who are even now debating changes in some of the most important maritime rights of belligerents ? The laws of nature and of humanity are eternal and immutable; not so " international law," for that would be to say that nations themselves were eternal and immutable.
By consulting the law of humanity, and doing equal justice between us and the Chinese, I was peited with a handsome storm of vituperation abroad, (mere dirt, whick brushed off when it was dry,) and I should have cared little even if I had not outlhved the slander.
And now, Sir, it depends much on ourselves whether this really becomes a Chinese war, or remains what it is at present, a Canton "dificulty." China is as big as all Europe, several of its provinces containing the area and population of European empires, and some of them hating their neighbours as heartily as England and France once foolishly hated each other. If we keep the quarrel personal with Yeh, and local to Canton, we shall probably get on very well elsewhere, for the Cantonese are infaoious among their oNvn northern countrymen. Canton is naturally the very worst place for our trade, which has been forced thereby (or rather in spite of) the exclusive policy of the Tartars, who placed it there jast because it was the worst place, andt very unwillingly yielded better ones, because we obliged them., I rather expect it will cease there now that everything is barnt down; just as Voltaire saysthat the tragedr of Hamlet ends-" because everybody is killed."
Let us beware how we attempt to have what some people. are pleased to call "an ambassador at Pekin." He woul& be a mere hostage, or at the best a diplomatic hen, hatching more quarrels than we have had even at Canton. I, for ose
should be sorry enough to intrust myself to the protection, of "international law," in such a queer field for it; exercise.
It required a lawyer's head to discover the real and unluestionable meaning of Sir J. Bowring in saying, that Yela did not know of the register of the Arrow havingexpirednamely, that he could not plead it as an excuse for his outrage on our fiag.

By the arrival of the Overland Mail we have received our private correspondence and papers from Hongkong to the 15th of January inclsivre; Calcutta, 23d of January; and Bombay, 2d of Februarv.
(FRoM OUR OWN CORRESPONDuNT.)
HONGKONG, JAN. 15.
Our last dates from London are to the 10th of November. The steamer Madras leaves to-day with the outward mails.
At Canton little change has taken place since I addressed you on the 30th of December. Our troops remain intrenched in the (Garden. Her Majesty's steamer Niger, with the flag of Admiral Seymour, is at anchor off the ruins of ttte factories, and the other men-of-war are distributed in the river, commanding the most important points. Several exceedingly well-planned attempts have been made to blow up and burn our vessels, and, although they have been as yet unsuccessful in doing any material injury, the greatest vigilance is necessary. The Mandarins have collected a large number of war junks in the creeks of the river, and on the 4th inst. they attacked the Macao Fort at lo w water. Her Majesty's steamer Encounter attempted to move down frorn her anchorage, but grounded, and the fight was maintained bythe fort, the steamer Coromandel, and men-of-war's boats until the rise of the tide enabled the steamer to come to their assistance, when the junks retired into shallow water beyond range.
Mr. Pearn, master's assistant of Her Majesty's ship Sybille, was killed during the action, and two officers and three seamen were woinded. The loss on the side of the Chinese must have been considerable, as the Minie rifles of ourmarines told severely.
On the 30th ult. the postal steamer Thistle, while on her way from Canton, was cut off by a party of Chinese, who had been received on board as passengers for Hongkong, but proved to be emissaries of the Chinese Government hired to perform the tragedy in which they succeeded. AlU on board were murdered with the exception of some Chinese passengers, and the vessel was then run ashore and burnt. There were two foreign passenges on board at the time-viz., a Spanish gentleman, Signor Dias, formerly Peruvian Consul General, and an invalid of the 59th Regiment.
Since this dreadful occurrence another river steamer has been attacked and narrowlv escaped capture at the hands of a Mandarin fleet, and communication with Canton is now almost entirely suspended.
There are no foreign residents there now whatever.
No trace has been obtained of Mir. Cowper, who was kidnapped at Wlhampoa. A coldblooded murder has been perpetrated there, the victim being a German servant of Dr. Ryder.
The Whampoa anchorage has been abandoned.
It is not expected that any active measures will be taken against the city of Canton until the arrival of troops and gunboats places in the hands of Admiral Seymour the means of striking a decisive blow both by land and water.
At present it is by no means an easy task to hold his present position, but this, we doubt not, he will do if possible, as any retrograde movement would be deemed a victory by the Chinese.
Of the Viceroy Yeh we have heard nothing lately, nor has any commissioner arrived from Pekin, although the Chinese assert that a very high official is on the way.
Of the rebels in the south we have no intelligence beyond a rumour that they have come to an understanding with Yeh, and combined to "eIxpel the barbarian !" Whether this be true or not, it is a peculiar fact that they do not seem to take advantage of the present state of affairs to press the Imperialists anywhere near Canton.
Our present force in China is quite inadequate to carry on with success any important operations, and we trust we shall not long be left without large and effective reinforcements of meii and ships. Light draught gunboats are much wanted.
In Hongkong all remains quiet as yet, and the stringent precautions which have been taken have had a bieneficial effect. Some of the worst characters have been apprehended, and will be deported.
Three men have been seized who are doubtless emissaries from Canton, sent here with mischievous intent. The result of their examinationhas not yet transpired. The colonial Government has hired and armed a small steamer to cruise in the neighbourhood.
The Mandarins have issued in various districts the most bloodthirsty edicts against the English, and have offered large re wards to those who may succeed in asassination or incendiarism in Hongkong.
Al] Chinese have been ordered to quit the service of foreigners and return to their homes, and so powerful is the iMandarin system that disobedience entails much trouble, if not positive destruction, upon the relatives of the offender. Nearly aU the Chinese servants have left or are leaving, and this creates no small inconvenience, anid also renders private property more insecure.
Her Majesty's ship Calcutta is in the harbour, and Admiral Guerrin has in the most handsomne manner offered the services of the crews of La Virginie and rteamer Catinat whenever they may be required; indeed, there is now a French guard stationed at one of the most unprotected points.
The Aimericans have also landed a guard at their naval stores and at another point.
A deputation of merchants waited on his Excellence Sir J. Bowring on the 5th inst., and presented a letter from those interested in property destroyed or abandoned at Canton or elsewhere, and requested his Excellency's views with reference to compensation. Sir John replied that the matter had been already brought to the attentioni of the honie * overnment.
We have just received intelligence from Canton informing us that the whole of the suburbs west of the city had been burnt by our force on the 12th inst. In this service *e regret to say that a party of the 59th Regiment missed their way, and getting under the city wall were assailed with stones and matchlocks, losing two meni killed, 11 severely wounded, and 10 slightly wounded.
A large fire had also taken place inside the city.
Admiral Seymour has decided on blowing up the Dutch Folly, retiring from the gardens, and making the Bird's-nest Fort his outpost, where we hope he will be able to remain until reinforcements arrive.

"' ATTEMPT TO RETAxE TEATOTuM FORT.
'; Our news from Canton was just a week old when Her Majesty's steamship Coromnandel, Lieutenant Douglas, R.N., commanding, arrived, about half-past 10 o'clock last night, bringing the following exciting information:-The Coromandel was lying with the Niger and Encounter off the Factory Ruins, Canton, when, at 20 minutes past 1 p.m. on Sunday last, a boat arrived from the Macao-passage Fort, advising the admiral of the approach below the fort of a large number of Chinese warjunks. Steam was got up immediately, and, with al the available boats in company, the Coroumandel proceeded to a reconnaimsance, the Eacounter being directed to foUlow as soon as possible. By -the time the Coromandel got down to the fort the Chinese had ranged that portion of their squadron, some *60 vessels, that had come down the Fatshan Creek, in a
line between Marines' Island and llarrow's Island, about midway between the Afacao-passage (Teatotum) Fort and the stations of the Hornet andComus offthebarrier-sayamileand a-quarter from the fort, a mile and a-half from the Barrier, and were excbanging shote. The time chosen for this approach had been well considered; it was a dead low neap tide, comsequently a vessel of the Hlornet's draught of water was unable to get up the passage, the Encounter being similarly disabled from getting down. But just as the Bncounter was under way some 20 or 30 vessels were seen coming into Starling Reach, and instead of proceeding directly it was deemed best to send a few shot into them.
The Niger, and the make-shift gunboat at the boom, too, took u the fire, and continued it till they retired. The Encounter then attempted to get down the Macao Passage. but unfortunately grounded somewhere off Birds' Nest Fort, on d was unable to get to tha assistance of the others
engaged. The accident being observed from the Coromandel, Sir Michael Seymour did not deem it prudent to do more with the Coromandel than stand oa the defensive, and accordingly dropped back with the tide, still firing from the bow gun, and sent the boats' crews into the fort. The Chinese, of course, attributed the movement to irresolution a 'nd caine on bravely to within 400 yards of the fort, when, from the minie s of the m arines and small arm men, 'till then under cover, they received repeated volleys, which muust have cono itted frightful execution. it was about half-past 2 that a 201b.-shot from the Chinese struck down Mr. P earn, master's assistant of Her Majesty's ship Calcutta, in charge of one of the cutters of his ship-a wound in the breast proving mortal. The cutter was ia.
mediately sent to the Encounter that he mighthave surgical attention, but he only lingered till xundown, sensible, and speaking of his family to the last moment. This gallaat young feUow had been in charge of the same boat throughout all the previous operations, and was an officer of high promise. It was about 4, or a little after, that the Chinese, finding they had again met more than their rantch, and knowing that as the tide made they could not show fight a minute, gave sigas of an intention to return the way they came, to freshen which movament the Coromandel and boats stirred up their wake, firing shot, shell, and rocket as fast as they could be poured in; and as the Chinese boats were crowded with men the havocamong them cannot have been trifling. At all events, they were too busily engaged in escaping to answer the fire. By 5 o'clock they were out of reach, in water too shallow for oar approach.
I I The Comus and the Hornet allthis time werehard at work too, the former, sprung ,broadside to Hamilton-creek, pouring the contents of her guns* into another division of Chinese janks which had made their appearance in that direction-the Hornet's long 68 into the rear of the division which had gone towards the fort, committing terrible execution, while the boomboats, headed by Captain Forsyth in his cutter, did their best in an unsuccessful attempt to cut offsome of the stragglers in their retreat. Just as the en. gagement was weU over and the Coromandel returning to her old berth off the Factory ruins the Encounter came down, anchored for a short time off Teatotun Fort, and then returned to Shameen.
" In addition to the lamentable casualty mentioned six men were wounded in the boats, and one boy of the firss class severely burnt on board the Coromandel, while in the act of screwing in a rocket-staff, which accidentaUy ignited, either from the friction of screwiag or the back fire of a previous discharge. It is supposed that not less than 7,000 Chinese, in altogether some 150 boats, were engaged in this the most plucky action on their part that has ever been witnessed by English naval officers. As the Coromandel passed down yesterday tey were again observed with their sails at the mastheads and flags flying, as though they intended trying another attack. Nothing else of importance has occurred during the past few days, and there is no fxrther word of the abosent Mr. Cowper, senior. Her Majesty's steamsloop Barracouta was passed at the Bogue, taking in guns from the Calcutta for Teatotum Fort.
"' Of course no one can feel astonishment at the Chinese doing their best whiUethey have the opportunity, for but little wil remain for them in this way directly our gunboats arrive. Only one of the Chinese junks was sunk, perhaps by themselves intentionally, in the fairway off Sixty-sixth Point, Barrow's Island. The Coromandel was struck three times, each slightly. The shot which killed Mr. Pea-n went into the Bittern's pinnace and there remained. The intention of the Chinese, it would appear, was to retake Teatotum Fort, and, had they been a little smarter and kept back our reinforcements, they mnight have succeeded.-Jan. 7.
" The Fei-ma, just arrived, tried to get up the Junk Passage to Canton, but finding 200 junks there came back to Whamupoa, and went up the Masao Passage, through which she with difficulty passed the half a-dozen junks found sunk at the barrier. The Admiral is to be here in the Barraeouta presently. Nothing has been heard of Mr. Cowper, sen. No other news of importance.
"THE THISTLE MASSACR{E.
"The last paper of the year was in the course of delivery On Wednesday evening, when news reached this colony of a more frightful local tragedy than any that had been told of in previes numbers. This was the cold-blooded murder of the captain, officers, foreign crew, and passengers, of the postal steamer Thistle-in all 11 souls. The particulars of this dreadful deed having been obtained from Chinese who escaped, and who during the ct will, most probably, have been in such a fright that but little power was lefb for observation, are imperfect, and in some respects conflicting. The intelligence, as first gleaned, was as follows:-
" With the shotholes in her bows and stack temporarily plugged Captain Weslien, undaunted by the attack on him on the night of the 22d ult., again proceeded with the Thistle on Sunday last on his customary voyage to Canton. The up trip was concluded successfully. On the way down, the water being low in French river, the vessel took the mud and so choked her feed pipes that a little below Whampoa, on Tuesday morning, it became necessary to anchor for the purpose of cleaning them. At half-past 10 in the forenoon of that day the steamer Shamrook came up, and after ascertaininR that nothing was required she took in tow 31er Majesty's steam-sloop Hornet's boat, previously alongside the Thistle, and proceeded on. Stopping only a couple of hours in Canton, the Shamrock again reached Whampoa by dusk on Tuesday evening, and was hardly at anchor when information was brought to the pilot to the effect that the Thistle had been taken into Second Bar Creek, and set on fire, and that the foreigners on board hal been decapitated. When first told of what had occurred, Captain Wood thought the report was merely that of the vessel's getting aground, or of the previous attack on her. Early next morning, however, the pilot, who had requested permission to go on shore, alleging that his father was dead, came off secretly and earnestly implored Captain Wood to turn all the Chinese passengers on shore, for, he asserted, he was sure it was their intention to take the vessel in the same way the Thistle had been captured.
" At daylight all doubt regarding the truth of the report was put at rest by the appearance of three of the Chinese servants of the Thistle, who then told the following tale:The steamer, they said, had not been long under way when the captain left the upper deck with a Manilla-man secunmy at the wheel, and proceeded towards the engineZoom hatchway, where he was in the act of stooping forward, looking down, when an assassin from behind stabbed him with one of those short-pointed swords of which every Chinese householder in Hongkong has one or more pairs. The first engineer, Mr. Abraham, an American, was on the other side of the hatchway at the tine, and was similarly assailed. two Manilla men secunnies were working at a hand pump below, and soon shared the same fate; one man got into one of the coal bunkers, and there, afterwards, unable to get out when the vessel was set on fire, was burnt. A passenger in the cabin-a Portuguese gentleman, whose name we do not publish until further assured of the identity-together with his servant, a Portuguese, were also murdered, as was a sick Artilleryman, who was lying down forward, and who was the first victim.
" The Captain on being stabbed ran aft, but fell before he reached the cabin-door. The mate (Petersen) succeeded in getting into the cabin, and fired several muskets at the wretches as they attempted to get hold of him. A stinkpot thrown into the cabin at last drove him overboard, and he must have been drowned, as he was never seen to rise. The Manilla zman at the wheel was kiled from behind, without seeing the hand that wielded the weapon. In all as we have said, 11 persons were thus disposed of, and search was made for the Chinese boys employed in the cabin, one of whow, by jumping overboard and hiding under the coun. ter of the vessel, succeeded in escaping, as did the others in other ways. The Chinese firemen were then directed to remain at their work, and the vessel was steered up the creek called by the Chinese Chowmee, to the village of Lamkongtow, distant some half-a-dozen miles inland. There her wood work was set on fire, and when that was destroyed, every particle of brass work that could be removed was taken away; in fact, the vessel is so much disabled that it is questionable whether it is vorth while to repair her. The assassins, said to have numbered under a dozen in all, lost no time in walking off with the heads of their victims in handkerchiefs, and at Canton, we suppose, will receive the rewards said to be offered for such comixodities by the gentry and people Having turned all the Chinese passengers out of the steamer' as suggested by the pilot, Captain Wood started for Hong. kong, first communicating tne above to the Hornet off Sunchow, and to the men of war lying at the Bgnue.
" The other of the postal steamers, the Rose, onherwayup on Tnesday morning, descried the burning vessel, and niade all speed up to report the fact to Her Majesty's ship Sybille at WhnIupoa. But nothing could be done without the orders
of tne commnodore, busily engaged with his men in the Dutch Folly-and the Rose was directed to pro ceed on her way to Carton without delay. Unfortunately, owing to the low state of the tide, it was not possible to get up the usual route, and she had to make detour by Blenheimn Reach. Before she could get tound the Barracouta was observed coming up with the Thbitle, her hull having been found at the mouth of the creek. The people of the village off which she had been taken, feariz,g lest the conseqnences might be visited on their heads, had prudently resolved to have her moved bY fishermen out into the stream, where in a short time she would have sunk, a stop cock being open, and a hole nad.3 in the starboard bow, by which nmeans she was nearly faU of water. After some little delay to arrange the manner in which the Barracouta should be safe for any salvage to be awarded, Captain Eicoby was permitted to take charge of his owner's vessel and return to EHongkong. Five headless bodies were found in. the hull, and in the coal bunker, as before stated, the charred remnains of another. Summoned to an inquest on one of these bodies, we shall be in a better position next week to confirm or amend what is now written."-Friend of Clina, Jan. 3.
"The coroner's inquest on the burnt remains of a human, body found in the coal bunker of 'What was the steamer Thistle stands adjourned till after the current criminsl sessions. It has transpired that when the assissins ha# completed or were upon their bloody wwork they threw of£
their garments and displayed the uniform of the Che Yeorg
-' Wise Braves'-a militia under the control of the Ming. I ling-tong, the society at Canton that has always beir. foremost in a display of hatred to barbarians. The report of the safety of the Portuoguese yassenger Senhor Francisco Diaz de Sobrecazas, Consul for Spain at Macao,
proves incorrect, we regret to find."-.fWend of Chins, 1 Jan. 7.
HONGKONG, JDN-. 15, 1 pr. | An attempt was made this morning to poison a considerable portion of the foreign community. The author of this diabolical act is a Chinese bake, named Esing, who (being doubtless induced by th - promises of reward held out by the mandarins) mixed with his bread a large quantity of arsenic, and after sending it round to his customers left f or Macao in a steamer at S a.m. AU who partook of this bread were shortly afterwards seized with violent retchings and other symptoms, but, prompe remedies being applied, we are happy to state tha' up to the present time no deaths have ensued, although great numbers have been ill, and some ar, still in a dangerous state. The quantity of arseni: was too large to answer the intended purpose, it
presence being immediately betrayed, and antidots; forthwith administered. It is fearful to contenmplat I what the results might otherwise have been. A steamer has been despatched to Macao in hopes of intercepting Esing, but we fear he will have gainei the mainland ere she arrives.
Trade remains entirely suspended here.
Exchange on London, 4s. 81d. to 4s. 9d.; n Bombay, 216r. Yery litt',le doing. Freights to England are nominal, but some vessels are tsken up to convey emigrants to Australia.

Two vessels had sailed for London.
From Shanghai we have advices to the 7th ins'. Intelligence of fair authenticity had been receive I1 from Nankin from which we gather that the rebels had failen out among themselves and committed many savage deeds. The leader Hung-siu-tsiuen, or Taipingwang, still, however, remained at the head of affairs, and had again defeated the Imperial troop3. The authorities at Shanghai remained as cordial as ever towards foreigners

INDIA.
(FROM£ OUR OWi,N coRESPOWDENT.)
BOMBAY, FEB. 2
Our news from Bushire comes down to the 17. h I of last month. At that date the troops were si:l unmolested by the enemy, part in the town, tile remainder in the intrenched camp outside the wal!s and in the neighbourhood of the wells. Pending the arrival of reinforcements one offensive mov.- ment only had been made by them; this was an attack on a depOt of Persian stores and ammunition collected at a place called Chakotah, 22 miles from the camp. The service was intrusted to Colonel Tapp, with a party of cavalry and horse artillery, who, marching out of Bushire early on the morning of New Year's-day, returned late in the evening, having accomplished the object of the expedition without loss, and, it would seem, without oppo - sition on the part of the enemy. His service is acknowledged by the General in the folowing terms:
'Major.General Stalker tenders his best thanks to Liettenant-Colonel Tapp and the officers and men of the detach - ment,which has so entirely and satisfactorily carried out the object of destroying the enemy's depot at Chakotah, and returning to camp last night after marching a distance of 4 miles. The Major-General begs that Major Wray and Liectenant Ballard, C.B., who accompanied the party, will alto accept his best thanks."
That the Persians were urging forward large reinforcements from Teheran to the southward was heard at head-quarters without incredulity, but without apprehension. The positions taken up by their troops, in anticipation of an advance from Bushire upon Shiraz, are considered by oiur military men to be eminently judicious; so much so as to suggest to them-or, at any rate, to oue of no slight experience-that Russian skill, not mere Persian intelligence, has planned them. The shortest roaI from Bushire to Shiraz is by Ehisht and Eszeroon. Of the difficulties presented by this route to the advance of an army I wrote in a former letter. So great are they that we may readily believe the report that the force collected at Kazeroon, though strongly placed, is not very numerous. But there is another and easier, though more circuitous, route which, proceeding from Bushire to the eastward as far as Ferozabad, and thence nearly due nortb, turns the flank of the mountains and approaches Shiraz by comparatively tiifling aeclivities. It is at Ferozabad, commanding this road, that the main strength of the Persian army is posted in numbers which the latest accounts raised to 20,000 men and upwardp. Here they are in a position either to receive oar advance, should we decide upon making one in thoer direction, or, in the event of our moving straight upon the passes, to harass our flank and impee-il our communications with Bushire, or to retire upon Shiraz and meet us as we struggle up the defiles at Kazeroon.
Anotber route into the heart of Persia is foutnd by ascending the river Karoon, which enters the Gulf by one of the mouths of the Tigris, as far as the town of Shuster, and thence striking off f. r Ispahan through the district of Louristan. Shuster, it is understood, will be the point of raising and assembling the proposed corps of Irregular Hors . For this purpose it is calculated not only from i:s
bemg situate among Arab tribes, who are, as is sauposed, perfectly ready to serve us, but also from i s proximity to the Turkish frontier and the Bash - Bazouiks and other wild horsemen of that empire.
With aU our constant talk of war, we find it diiicult to persuade ourselves that the resistance of Persia will be a sustained one. Clearly it will no-, unless ber mighty northern neighbour powerfully supportsher. Meanwhile, the second division of the army is gradually assembling on the Peraiin seaboard. I mentioned in my last the deparuite of General Outram and the head-quart. r staff of the army. Touching at Kurrachee,
he would reach Bushire in the latter days *.f January. The 78th Highlanders and the 9(th Native Infantry have sailed, as also the mountain train, the additional field battery, and three colrnpanies of the Light Battalion. The seven remaining companies of this latter corps are still he!e waiting for the commissariat stores which are to be sent up to them. Some of the vessels contair.-
ing them will caUl at Porebunder to embarlk t e 23d from P2ajeote. The 1st Seinde Horse, afttr being countermanded on account of anticipatt I disturbances among the mountain tribes on thi frontier of Beloochiatan, are again under orders, and are moving down to Kurrachee. The Guzerat Horse sends up 300 sabres to supply in part their place, and a similar or larger number is to be drawn from the Southern Mahratta Horse. Should circumstances render such a moveme! t
advisable, Bengal troops from the Punjab garrisons ,could also be sent down the Induw in native boats (the steamers and flats are withdrawn for service in the Gulf) to cover the somewhat denuded province and awe its turbulent neighbours.
Of the likelihood of an advanice from Peshawar into Affghanistan nothing has reached us worthy of notice. Gossip there has been, as was natural, now of a march upon the Ehyber, now of a move by Ferozepore and the river upon the Bolan. UJp to
the 17th of last month the Dost had shown no sign' of an intention to quit his pleasant quarters at Peshawur. Little was known, though much was conjectured, relative to the conferences that had taken place between the Ameer and Sir John Lawrence. At Cabul, however, the conversation that passed at their first interview was freely reported, or invented, and consisted of a vehement request for British aid on the one side, and a courteous postponement of all discussion till his visitor should be rested on the other. On his way through the pass to Peshawur two couriers reached the Ameer with despatches, one from the north, the other from the south. The former was despatched by Mahomed Afzal, the governor of Balkh, and brought news of the restless and encroaching movements of the Russians, who appear to be effectively bringing under their rule the whole kingdom of Kokan in addition to that of Ehiva. The other came from Hyder Khan at Candahar with intelligence of the posture of affairs at Herat, which, however, as far it has reached us, addalittle to our former information. Theplace, aswehavebeentoldbefore, isthoroughlyrefortified, and we are again assured that tbere are Russian officers in the place, whose vigorous counsels give life and strength to the proceedings of the Persian conquerors.
It is reported that Sir Henry Lawrence is to fill Sir James Outram's place as Commissioner of Oude. The successor of Mr. Bushby, as Resident at Hyderabad, is not yet nominated.
I mentioned some months ago the promulgation of an order prohibiting the practice of hook-swinging in the Poonah collectorate. The collector of Candeish had, I believe, been even earlier in the field against this barbarous custom. At the great annual fair held at Mhyjee, in his collectorate, the number of performers or sufferers was always very large. This year, for the first time, not a swinger was to be seen. The scaffolds were there, and the poles and the hooks, but the authoritative proclamation had gone forth, and the sabres and bayonets that were in
readiness on the ground forbade all idea of disobe-t dience to the edict. However, they were unfortunately near the border of the province of Berar, where they were stiU free to disport themselves after their horrid fashion, and thither they proceeded, to the chagrin of the officers and visitors present.
Writing on this subject, I am reminded of another native practice the prohibition of which is of much older date-infanticide in Cattewar. Colonel Lang, the political agent among the petty princedoms of that province, has lately completed and forwarded to Government his census of the child-destroying tribes for 1855. By this document it appears that the number of children, both male and female, has very considerably increased; that the women having more than one female child living are more numerous than in any previous year; and that the proportion of female children to male is becoming normal and satisfactory. The reduction of the marriage expenses (the magnitude of which was one great incentive to the commission of the crime) is strongly and successfully urged upon the tribes by the infanticide censors; and the payments made by Government on this account are being gradually reduced.
You will hear from Calcutta that the proposed Indian Penal Code has been read a first time in the Legislative Council and referred to a Select Conimittee ; also, that the Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Loan is closed and a new one at Five per Cent. opened. Here there has been little or no variation in the main features of the trade or in the moneymarket.
Telegraphic advices from Calcutta two days ago announce a further rise of 2 per cent. in the Bank of Bengal rate of discount, making 9 per t cent, on Government paper and 11 per cent. on | private bills. Exchange on London 2s. 1id.
COMMIERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
REPORT ON THE STATF OF BOMBAY MARHET FOM THE
16TH OF J£NJUARY TO THE 1ST OF EBRTUARY, 1857.
The Overland Mail from London of the 26th of December reached Bombay at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 22d of January per Peninsular and ._riental Company's steamship Singapore.
Our noney-market during the fortnight has been, if anything, slightly easier, ard no further rise has taken place in the rates of interest ruling at the banks. On the 16th ult. the Government opened a 5 per cent, loan for three crores of rupees, no part of which can be paid off before the latter end of 1871, but it is generally supposed that the public will not contribute to this loan to any extent, therefore the Government must either open a 6 per cent. loan or take 4 per cent. paper in the proportion of one-half as part payment to the new loan to secure the amount of money required.
We quote 5 per cent. paper at i per cent. discount, and 4's at 811-few buyers.
Cotton Piece Goods.-The market in general may be said to be in the same favourable position as we last noticed, and the business done has been to an extent that shows that operations have been conducted with activity. Gray longcloths have changed hands at advanced rates. Gray domestics have also shown & slight improvement in prices; inferior quality is in little request. Gray jaconots have realized fom 10r. to 12r. for pick goods. In gray shirtings 40 and 45 inch makes, the pnces have somewhat advanced. Gray T- cloths have had a fair amount of business transacted in them, the market not being well supplied. In gray madapollams, also, the business done has been to a fair extent.
Bleached and Fancy Goods.-Lappet scarfs, 2j yard goods, are much in request, and fetch 1r. 4an. per piece. Book muslins are dull of sale. Of lappets, though the stocks are not heavy, no advance in price has been reported; colo-ured lappets also showm no improvement in the rates. Bleached madapollams are difficult of sale, andbleached jaconots have been sold to a slight amount.
Cotton Yarns remain steady as last reported.
Metals.-Iron is in moderate inquiry. Nail rod, sheet and hoop are in fair demand, while Swedish bar may be said to be firmn. Pig and sbeet lead, and tin plates are scarce. Spelter bas udvanced.
Marine Stores.-Of canvas, stocks have been much reduced, bet the prices do not show any improvement as might have been anticipated, Twine is evidently improving, though cordage is rather dull of sale.
hineaL-No sales have been reported during the fortnight.
Cotton WooL-The market has risen up from 4r. to 5r. per candy on goods of all qualities, owing to the rices rnling in England. We quote old Dhollera at 121. to 122r., new, 123r. to 124r.; new Surat and Broach, at 127r. to 12Sr.; Oomrawutty, at 122r.; Candeish, llar. to II6r.; sawginned, 126r. to 127r.; Compta, 118r. to ll9r.; and Mangarole, 112r. to 113r.
Oil secds have undergone no change in prices, but remain firm. Linseed, however, is a little lower in value. No transactions have been reported in rapeseed, though teel has changed hands from 22ir. to 234r. per candy.
Opiuni.-'This article has further declined since our last, and we at present quote the drug at 925r. to 930r. per chest.
Tonnage.-Since the arrival of the last overland mail the rates of freight have advanced from 31. 2s. 6d. to 31. 5s. per t< n for Liverpool, and 31. to 31. 2s. 6d. for Londorn.
Exchiange.-Owing to the continued beavy receipts of ballion front Europe the rate has given way, and bills have been sold as low as 2s. lId., but latterly first-class paper has been done at 9s. -d., and local bills and documents at 2s. 2d. Count's bils" on Calcutta, 60 days' sight, 98' ; Madras 30 da3s'sight, 98A ; China, 60 days' sight, 211A.
THE CALCUTTA MARY-ET.
(From the Calcutta Englihkman of Jan. 23.)
S.nce cur last report of the 8th inst._we have been iD
receipn of intelligence from London itS Bomnbay to the 10b7 ult. The steamer Bengal, with the mails, was announced the evening before last, and came to her moorings yesterday aftermcon. Tbe advices by the London mail of the 26th ult. very received liere this morning by electric telegraph from Bumlkav.
Our advices from China received vi4 Bombay extend to the otL nilt. No material change had taken place in the state 'A atlfl.bs in that counatry, trade being entirely muepended at Cnawoa and little business doing at Hongkong. Tthe niew-,f the total destruction of the foreign factories at Ce,nton by fiYe giv-en irn our last issue ba enconfirmed.
Tbe init-rval that has elapsed since the despatch of the last mail baR not been marked by much activity in our
prodtuc aiket. -which has continued, generally speaking, iixnmuch abheut the same positioni. The low stocks of our
st3ple articles and the comparatively higher prices ruling in our market have confined operations to a smaller scale than the favourable advices received from home would have led us to expect. Indigo continues to move off steadily at the
decline last quoted. Raw silk has been in better favour, but very litrle bueiuess doing. Corahs have been rather flat, the ansount of araLsactions during the past fortnight being very linited. Sailtpetre has not been generally dealt in, in conspq:nencc of high prices. Little doing in sugar for Great
Britain. Hides continue in very active demand with an up-
w fard tendency in valne. Jute sti comnands extreme
gures, ut we havelittle of fine quality offering. In oil seeds ma small busines iS in progress for the Briti"h markets. Rice hasbeen easier and spplies moreabundant. Wheat ratherdroopintg. An improved demand has prevailed for castor oiL.
In imur import-market a better feeling has been observed
durmng the fortnight under review. The nature of the ad-
vices from the upper and north-west, proiinces for British cotton piece goods },eing more favourable, pcoIled with moderate stoks n ouir markets, has indttced dealers to extend
their operations and larger prchaseashavebeen made of &ray
gd, insomeinstances at higher figures. Gray shirtings
* ". The Oomus, having re,pued those thrown overboard in tne typloon laatyear, gam mount s4tbirty-twvo&
have been in boetter inquiry and value has improved. Gray jaconots and madapolnams have continued to sell freely, the latter at a slight advance. In white there has been no alteration, the demand being very limited. Turkey red goods are gradualy improving. A better feeling has been displayed for mule twist, but no improvement in prices has yet taken place. Nothing has been done in metals.
Money-market.-On the day our last mail closed the directors of the Bank of Bengal raised their rates of interest and discount two per cent. all round, making their charge fior loans on deposit of Company's paper 8 per cent. and of , ther goods 9 per cent. per annum. Yesterday again the Bank's rates were raised further I per cent. aU round, and it is evident that money is getting dearer in the market, and we shalL soon be in a less favourable position than we a2e at this moment. The event of the fortnight, however, in connexion with our mnoney-market has been the closing of the 43 per cent. Government Loan, and the opening in lieu of it on the 16th inst. of a 5 per cent. Loan. She former financial measure of our Government has proved what it was generaUy expected-a failure-the total amount subscribed in all the presidencies, it is said, soarcely exceeding 20 lacs. The amount now required at 5 per cent. is three crores, which will notbe paid offfor 16 years. Tho present loan does not seem to meet with much favour in general
and there seems an opinion prevalent among persons well asquainted with the present state of monetary matters here that it will share the same fate as its predecessor, and that Government will be ultimately compelled to adopt what has been so repeatedly urged,--i.e., to receive from subscribers a moiety in cash and the other moiety in Four per Cents. at
par. We are informed that up to the present moment a t very small amount has been paid into the Treasury on account of the new 5 per cent. Loan.
By the last published statement of assets and liabilities of the Bank of Bengal for the week eodint on the 14th inst., it appears that the cals on the Bank both for cash andother accommodation have been on the increase lately, the amount of silver having decreased from 10S,12,357r. loa. lp. on the 31st ult., to Company's rupees 98,50,406 Za. 4p., i-nd the loans on deposit of securitiies having increased from 170,20,224r. 14a. ip. to l82,39,909r. 2a. lOp.
Shares.-We have scarcely had any alteration in the value of any joint-stock shares. Bank of Beneals contiuue
at 6,500r. ; Bengal Coal Company's at 1,300r. ; Steam- I tugs at 1,15Sr., and India General at 1,125r. East Indian Railway Company's shares have slightly declined, beingnow worth 227r. to 229r. per 201. share.
Government securities continued torule at the same rates as at the date of our last until the announcement of the Government 5 per cent. Loan, when the value of all descriptions of paper gave way; and we now quote Company's Fours at 17r. Sa. ; Sicca Fours at lSr. Sa. * and Company's Fives at 4a. to Sa. per cent. discount. We have scarcely any purchasers for the 4A per cents., which might be quoted at 10 per cent, discount. The operations on the whole have been on a lmited scale.
Exchange onLondon.-Agood business was done at slightly lower rates, credits having been placed at 2s. 2id. to 2s. 24d., and documents at 2s. 23d. per rupee, but the last two days the first-named class of papers has again been sold at 2s. 2id. to 2s 2gd. per rupee, which may be considered as the closing rates.
On China.-Some 60 days' sight bills were negotiated at 211, but since the opium sale of the 12th inst. 210r. per $100 have been accepted by sellers, and a fair amount of transaotions took place at the last-named rate. There being, however, very few buyers, sellers have given way, and some business has been done at 205r. per $100.
Freights.-The engagements during the past and present weeks have been extensive in comparson with the moderate rupply of tonnage xzow available, many vessels long overdue not having made their appearance yet. Shipments of rice to Great Britain have been resumed with activity, the rates to London varying from 3Z. 10s. to 31. 15s. ; and to iAverpool 31. to 31. 5s. per ton ; and 31. 15s. to 41. for seeds to the former place only. We hear of a vessel having been
retailed for America at $12A per ton, bht there is no I active demand fortonnage in consequenceof the acoumulation of a large number of chartered ships at $15 to $16 per ton,
which are being loaded on account of the charterers. I Nothing has been done for the West Indies or Australia, I nor any ship taken up for Mauritius since our last. Some inquiry has prevailed for loading at Arracan and the Bur. man coast, but, as the accounts from the former place for grain are rather discouraging, and shippers ask a long period for loading, few ships would be prevailed upon to enter into engagements, more especially as our supplies of produce are becoming more abnndant. No ships have been taken up for France or the Mediterranean, and we have had but few charters for other places during the fortnight under review-i. e.. Robert Morrison, for Bombay, for 9,250r ; Capabiribe and John Temperley, for Hamburg, at 41. 2s. 6d. all round; He and scar, to Arracan and thence to Hamburg, at ound; Arracan to Elongkong, Macao, or Whampoa, to load eith rice at S5c. a-bag.

T1E FPERSIAN WAR.-On Satnrday appeared iu print a copy of the correspondence showing the proportion of the expenses incurred in sending an expedition against Persia which is to be defrayed out of the revenues of the united kingdom. It appears that the BPombay expedition was prepared (at least, so it is presumed) under the orders of Her Mlajesty's Government, communicated through the S- eret ConiLoittee, and the directors of the East India Comnp al y accordlingly addressed the Board of Control on the 22d o.f October last, " suggesting how far it might be just and proper to subject India to the whole of the charges conse(luent on the orders" referred to. Allusion is made to the case of Affghanistan, and the burden entailed on India by the Affghan war. This letter was reforred to the Foreigncf-ice, and thence to the Treasury. Their Lordships decided to propose to Parliament to provide for one moiety of the extraordinary evpenses of the expedition-viz., that portion of the expense over and above the ordinary pay and allowances of the troops, and the ordinary charge of the Company's slips employed. The Court of Directors ex-
ressed tteir satisfaction at this arrangement, and promised to transmit an estimate of the expense prior to the meeting of Parliament. That estimate does not appear on the face of the vapers before us.

ALEXANDRIA, EZB. 20.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Valetta arrived here from Marseilles this day, and will leave on her return voyage early to-morrow morning. The Ripon, with the heavy portion of the mails, had justreaohed Malta when the Valetta left that island,and she is hourly expected here; but not being yet sig,hted it is till uncertain when the outwardmails arelikelyto leave Suez.
We are now in momentary expectation of hearing of the Viceroy's arrival at Cairo, intelligence having been received some days ago that he might be expected about this time. Meanwhile, and in consequence of orders which have preceded His Highness, the authorities of Cairo and of Alexandria are levying a number of young men, out of whom it appears about 600 are to be selected and formed into a special corps of " Guards." The number required isnot large, but it has been sufficient to cause considerable perturbation among-the labouring classes, and even, to some extent, a cessation of business in the bazaars. Notwithstanding the improvements introduced by the present Viceroy into the treatment of the Egyptian soldier, both in regard to his food and to his clothing, aU classes of the population look upon Government service of every description with feelings of great aversion, and although the men generally appear soon to grow reconciled to their new mode of life, Btill the spectacle attending these oft-recurring impressments is not the less distressing, when mere lads are seen carried off along the streets, followel by a bevy of shrieking and wailing women, they themselves wearing an air of helpless resignation.
It does not appear likely that we shall hep of many important changes or reforms in conn&-ion 'with the government of the districts that have just been visited by the Viceroy. We have, however, already some rumours of the dismissal and puniishmuent of sundry oficials convicted of peculation and oppressive practices, and a noteworthy innovation, inasmuch as it in some degree affects one of the general principles according to 'hich taxes have been levied in the East from time immemorial, is likewise spoken of. A considerable impost is levied in the upper country upon the sakiehs, or machines used for raising water for purposes of irrigation. This tax has not only been very materially reduced, but it appears that the Viceroy, having had an opportunity of seeing the evil effects arising from the rule by which the successive neihbours of an abscondin,g taxpayer are held respousible for his arrears, has decreed that henceforward the responsibility 'will be limited to the fugitives' immediate neighbours, who will be entitled to the use of the deserted sakieh. The flight of one man might, under the old system, lead to the desertion of an entire district, a state of things which the measure spoken of certainly remedies, but the policy of the tax itself, however much the amount may have been reduced, is looked upon as very questionable, acting as it does in the form of a check on the much needed extension of further means of irrigation.
Over what may be the ultimate fate of the expedition that had been organized to explore the White Nile there still, to some extent, bangs. a doubt, but it is very generally feared that all prosDect of seeing the realization of the hopes that were entertained respecting it mustbe abandoned ; and, owing chiefly to the deDlorable dissensions between several members of the expedition and their leader, the asffair has certainly for the present come to an avowed deadlock. It may perhaps, however, still be hoped that the return of the Viceroy will lead to a reorganization, and meanwhile lIr. Twvyford, who by last accounts had reached Dongola, and who, it wll be remembered, was to he overtaken by his colleagues, wvas still pursuing his way up the river, though, probably, in perfect uncertainty as to how sOOn he may have to retrace his steps.
Transactions in the Alexandria grain-markets during the past fortnight have been on a very limited scale, attributable, however, in great measure to the prevalence of wet and stormy weather, causing a suspension both in shipping operations and in the reception of grain from native boats. Said wheat, of private trade produce, is quoted 40s. to 42s. per quarter free on board; beans, 32s. to 32s. 6d. In cotton there has been an active business, with further advance in prices, and it is universally admitted that this year's crop will prove seriously deficient in quantity. The depression in the freight-market is greater than ever, and ships with difficulty obtain any offer whatever.

COURT OF OHANCERY, LFRCOt'S-imZ. F. 23.
CROO1 V. WR1MT.VV
(Before the LORD CHANCELLOR3
This part-heard appeal from an order of Vice-Chancellor Wood, allowing a demurrer to the plaintiff's bill, was this morning resumed. The point raised by the suit for the determination of the Court was what meaning was to be
laced upon the word" nieces," used in the will of An urred, dated August, 1847. The clause in the will was as follows:-" I bequeath unto each of the present nieces of Peter Eaton, late of Halton, in the county of Chester, surgeon, deceased, for her own absolute benefit, the sum of
X00!l; and i mcase any of them shanl die in imy lifetime, leaving a child or children who shall survive me, then and in every or any such case the legacy .intended for her so dying shall go to her child or children in equal shares, if more than one." It happened that Peter Eaton, who died as far back as the year 1792, had seven nieces, only one of whom was living at the date of Ann Orred's will, and she was then a wi:ow of upwvards of 75 years of age. There were, however, upwards of 30 descendants of the six deceased nieces, and the contention on behalf of the plaintiffs was that the testatrix, by using the word ' nieces," intended a plurality of legatees, and consequently that each of such descendants was entitled to a legacy of 2,0001. It did not appear from any evidence that the testatrix knew the state of Peter Eaton's relations at the time of making her will, and the Vice-Chancellor therefore held that, as there was nothing to show she intended the word " nieces" to be construed in any other than its ordinary signification, the legacy was confined to the one living niece. There was also a question of substitution raised by the bill, which it is not necessary to go into.
Mr. Aston and Mr. Tarner appeared for the appellants.
Mr. ROLT and Mr. LITTLE supported the decision of the Court below.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR said all the cases cited went only to show that under certain peculiar circumstances, or from the context of the will itself, the Court was sometimes 3onstrained to infer that a testator intended a word of designation to have a different meaning to its ordinary one. In the present case there was nothing to show the testatrix at the date of her will was aware that only one niece of Peter Eaton was alive, and, therefore, the Court could nob come to the conclusion that she intended there should be a plurality of legatees. The plain inference was that the testatrix by the words "present nieces of Peter Eaton" meant nothing more than to give a legacy of 2,0001. to as many of such nieces as should be then lving. Because there only happened to be one niece at that time alive, it was preposterous to suppose the testatrix intended the word "nieces" to include children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren of the deceased nieces, as contended for by the appellants. The case was free from all doubt, and the appeal must be dismissed, and with costs.

BRANDLING V. PLUMMER.
This appeal from a decision of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley was argued on the 19th and 20th of December, 1856, and the 23d of January last, when judgment was reserved. The question in dispute was whether a judgment was pro erly ocketed within the statute 4th and 5th of Wiiam and Mary, chap. 20, sections 2 and 3 ; the entry of the issue in an action did not contain a statement of the number roll, though the same appeared a few pages further on. The validity of the docket would rule w.hether the judgment was good as against purchasers for value. The Vice-Chancellor held that the docket was invalid.
Mr. Anderson, Mr. Rasch, and Mr. Rochfort Clarke were counsel for the appeal- Mr. Swanston, Mr. Glasse, Mr. Schomberg, Mr. W. D. tewms, Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Toller Mr. W. Forster, Mr. Fooks, and Mr. Joyce appeared folr the other parties.
Lord Justice TtuNER held, agreeing with the Vice. Chancellor, that the objection to the docket was fatal, sor y as he was to give effect to so merely technical an objection, The appeal would be dismissed without costs.
Lord Justice Xn-GsT BRuCE acknowledged that he was not satisfied that the requisitions of the statute hade not been complied with, but as Lord Justice Turner had agreed with the Vice-Chancellor the appeal must fail, and would be dismissed without costs.
STOURTON V. STOURTON.
The facts this case were reported in 2Vs Tim-es of the 25th inst. The short point, it will be recollected, was whether the mother of a male child, ten years and nine months old, should be his guardian, the Mtaster of the Rolls having decided in her favour. The late father of the boy lived and died a member of the Roman Catholic Church. The child was born a week after his father's death, and about two years afterwards the mother, who had been a member of the same communion, became a member of the Church of England, and thenceforth brought up the child in the same church without any remonstrance or opposition from or on the part of the father's relations.
Mr. Bagshawe and Mr. Bagshawe; jun., were counsel for the appellants; Mr. Roundell Paleer and Mr. G. liL Giffard supported the decision of the Master of the Rolls.
The little boy was brought into court from Brighton about I o'clock, and was ushered into the private room of the Lords Justices, where he remained more than half an hour. Their Lordships remained absent for another half. hour, at the conclusion of which time they re-entered the court, when
Lord Justice KNICHT BRUCE said,-We mean to consider what ought to be done in this matter. The young gentleman need not be detained any longer in London.

(Before the MASTEP of the RoLLs.)
This was a suit instituted for the pur,ose of having the rights of the parties to certain property determined, under the following circumstances:-Captain and Mrs. Anderson executed a postnuptial settlement, by which it was agreed that the property of mrs. Anderson shonld be settled upon the husband and wife respectively for their lives; and the settlement contained a covenant that property thereafter acquired by Mrs. Anderson should be settled in like manner. Some property of the wife did come into possession, and Captain Anderson d rected it to be paid to the trustees upon the trusts of the settlement. Since his death other property has come into Mrs. Anderson's possession, which she refuses to have settled. She, however, claims a life interest in the property already settled, and the questions before the Court were whether she was entitled to an interest under the settlement, and also to retain the property received
His Hoioux said, the husband had adopted the settle. ment by paying to the trustees the property that came into possession in his lifetime. Mrs. Anderson must make her election. If she refused to hand the subsequently acquired property over to the trustees, which he held she was not
bound to have settled, she might do so, but in that case her life interest in the property settled must accumulate for the benefit of the children.
Mr. Loyd, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Teed, Mr. Follett, Mr. Prendergast, Mr. Goldsmid, and Mr. Gowan appeared in the case.

Air. U. G. Addison appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. T. Cbitty for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff. Alfred Gwilt, a bmilder in Union-street, in the Borougb, sued the defendant, a Miss Fitch, to recover the sum of 331. Ils. 8d., being the amount of bhe plaintiff's bill for making a watercloset and doing other repairs at a house belonging to the defendant, No. 6, Union-street, Borough, next door to the plaintiff's own premnises.
The plaintiff's case was that he was employed to repair a drain, and so to prevent a nuisance at the house in question, and which also affected the plaintiff's own premises; bat as he proceeded with the work he said he found the place in such a rotten state that it became neces3ary entirely to rebuild it, though his principalwitness, the tenant of the house, said this was unnecessary, so far as his comfort was concerned. According to the plaintiff's own statement, the defendant's brother, an attorney in Union-street, had told him to do what was necessary, and to make a good job of it. Hle denied that he had ever undertaken to do the job for 51. and he said that when be bad sent in his bill Mr. Fitch said he was astonished at it, and that he would not pay mnore than 51.
Mr. Fitch was called for the defendant, and stated that he had entered into a special contract with the plaintiff to do the Job for 51., and that be had entered a memorandum in his diary to that effect. The memorandum was read, and hlel positively denied that he had given the general authority
Lord CAsarnnu. left it to the jury to say whether they believed the evdence gien by the plaintiff, or that given by
the defendant's brother, Mr. Fitch. If the entry made ba the latter was r false one, certainly the fraud attempted was a most scandalous one, and one for which he ought to be struck off the rolls. Bat the jury mnust decide which side tbey would believe.

BUSLSESS OF THE COURT. When the last cause was called on
Lord CAPBEI,L said that, with the valuable assistance of the jurymen, the Court had been able to get through the whole of the causes standing for trial at these sittings (more than 100). The jurymen were therefore entitled to the thanks of the country for their services, which, through his (Lord Campbell's) month, they now received.

This was an actien of detenue, to recover possession of a written agreement detained by the defendant. Tie declara. tion contained four connts, and each count was answered by three leas.
LOra CAMPBELL said it was lamentable th at special plead. iong which was of great service in raising important ques. tions for the decision of a jury, sometimes tended rather to perplex them. Here was a case in which there were 12 pleas.
Mr. JOYCE, as to the pleas, pleaded that he (Mr. Joyce) was "Not Guilty," and in confession and avoidance he alleged that there were four counts in the declaration.
Lord CAMPBELLu said that if pleading was so perverted the necessary effect would be that it must be altogether abolished. Nothing could have been more perspicuous tba
themannerinwhichthepleadings had been opened, but still the jury could not have the smallest notion of what the question was they were going to try.
Mr. SEwrNER said he would endeavour to get out of the London fog in which he found himself.
Lord CAMIPBELL hoped the counsel would abandon the special pleading, and come to common sense.
Mr. ;SK}iNER said that was a high aspiration, but he would endeavour to do so.
Mr. JOYCE said the question would be whether the defen. dant did not hold the agreement for the plaintiff jointly with another person named Phipps, to whonm the plaintiff had sold "1The Lord Grey.",
" The Lord Grey" was a publichouse in the Bethnalgreen-road, and it appeared the defendant was a publichouse broker, and had acted for both parties. He said he held the agreement for the plaintiff and Phipps. This was denied by the plaintiff, and Phipps was not called, for he could not be found. The defendant said Phipps had given hhn notice not to part with the agreement or deposit, as the plaintiff had misrepresented the business.
Lord CAM'BELL said if the jury believed that the defendantvwasastakeholdertheir verdict ought to be for the defendant.
The jury immediately found for the defendant.

PREROGATIVE COURT, SATURDAY. Thin 9R
DE BVAUCBESl V. HODflcSOV
(Before Sir J. DoBsox.1
T'his was a basiness of proving in solemn form of law the last will and testament, with two codicils thereto, of MajorGeneral Hodgson, late of No. 65, Avenue do St. Cloud, heretofore admitted to probate, promoted by the Viscountess de Beauchesne, the daughter and only next of kin of the deceased, agaiust Mrs. Helen Hodgson, widow, the relict of the deceased, and one of his executors.
The testamentary papers were propounded in a short allegation pleading their due execution, the approval ef them by the deceaeed, and his capacity.
A plea was then given in on behalf of the Viscountess de Beauchesne, in which it was alleged that her father was an Englishman by birth, but died domiciled in Paris on the 8th of March 1855, without leaving any wil valid by the laws of France. lHs personal property was valued at 17,0001. In 1799 he went to the East Ildies as a cadet in the service of the East India Company, and remained there until 1S29, when, from impaired health, he returned to England. He continued to reside here until 1832, when he went to reside at Paris, principaUy, it was said, for the education of his daughter and only child, who in 1836 married Viscount de Beauohesne, a native of France, according to the ceremony prescribed by the law of that country. The deceased was present at the marriage. His daughter having thus become domiciled in France, the deceased, in 1836, finaUy determined to become a domiciled inhabitant of that country, and until the day of his death resided at different places in Paris and its neighbourhood, though occasionaUy absent. He expended a considerable sum in the purchase of furniture for his French residences. Occasionally he made exCUrSions to England either on matters of business or on visits to his friends, but they were not of long duration, except in 1840, when he met with an accident which detained him here for some time. In 1844 his daughter, who had previously been separated from her husband, went to reside with her father, and continued to do so until his second marriage in 1848. His first wife died in 1844, whereupon he purchased a plot of ground in the Northern Cemetery of Paris, end constructed a vault of safficient dimensions to hold si.x persons, which he intended, as he said, for the recephon of his first wife, himself, his daughter, and her three children.
A responsive allegation was then given in on the part of Mrs. Hodgson, the widow, which pleaded that he continued in the military service of the East India Company until his death, and was in the receipt of full pay, amounting to about 1,4001. per annum. Under the engagenent made he was liable to be called upon at any time to return to India. When he returned from India in 1829 he rented a house near Callander, in Scotland, with a manor annexed, over which he enjoyed the right of shooting, being always very fond of English field sports. He was strongly attached to the society of his English relatives and friends. On going to Paris in 1832, partly for the education of his daughter, and partly on account of the health of his first wife, he expressed his intention to return permanently to England, and spent several months here in 1834 and 1835. He uniformly expressed regret at his daughter having married a foreigner, and subsequently changed his residence in Paris. He rented apartments there, solely by the desire of his wife, until'her death in 1844. In 18.39 he took a house for five years caUed Glencaird, in Scotland, for the sake of being near his brother, Admiral Hodgson. In 1840 he was solely prevented from renewing his residence there in consequence of the accident which occurred to him in London. He then visited the baths of Bourbonne, in France, and having partially recovered in 1841 quitted France for England and Scotland, where he remained 10 consecutive months. He repeatedly urged his wife to accompany him to Scotland, that they might establish themselves near his reltions, bnt she uniformly objected thereto. Upon her death he shut up the apartments which he then occupied, and spent the greater part of the two succeeding years in England and Scotland. He frequently expressed his intention of marrying again and settling in England. In 1846 he went to Paris, with the view of paying a short visit, and lived in furnished apartments. It was represented to him by a common friend that, his daughter being separatedfrom her husband, it was desirable he shom2d provide a temporary home for her in France, to which he reluctantly agreed. In 1848 he married an English ladyMiss Honyman, daughter of the late Admiral Honyman. The marriage took place at the English embassy in Paris, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, and he frequently expressed his intention of taking his wife with hm to England, but postponedhisbdeparture in consequence of the state of her father's health. Her father died in Paris in that year. The plot of ground which he had purchased in the Northern Cemetery was the smaUest that could be procared in perpetuity. Shortly after the death of his wife', father he had an attack of illness, 'which prevented him undertaking a journev to England. In 1849 his daughter, it was averred, threatened to institute proceedings in the Consistory Court of London for the purpose of declaring his marriage null and void by reason of his alleged imbecility, and some steps were taken but not proceeded with. In 1850 the daughter presented a petition to the Court of Chancery for a vrit de lunatico in, quircndeo, bat the petition was dismissed. In consequence of these proceedings he was indueed again to postpone his departure for England. In May, 1851, he came to England with his wife, bringing all his servants with him, and took a furnished house at Southsea for three months. His daughter having renewed her threats to set aside his marriage, by the advice of friends he went back to France to spend the winter. Soon after his return he experienced an apoplectic seizure, and at the close of 1852 he had a renewed attack of illness which rendered him delirious, and from that period until his death he was never again capable of exercising his own will or judgment. The allegation denied that he ever intended to become permanently domiciled in France, and pleaded that both in his letters and conversation he uniformly expressed the greatest preference for his native country. He never possessed any landed or real property in France, and never kept any banking account there.
e was constantly in the habit of executing wills in the English form, and depositing them with his agents in London. He never applied for letters of naturalization in France, or for the audthorization of the French Government to establish his domicie there. The testamentary papers were executed in accordance with the English Wills Act. By the will, dited the 21st of August, 1848, he gave to his wife 6,0001. Bank annuities, bis plate, furniture, &o., and aU moneys and securities for mmney which might be in his apartments at Paris at the time of his decease. Unto eaclihof the three eldest children of his daughter he gave 1,0001. Bank annuities a-piece, and to ber fourth child 50l sterling. To his daughter he gave 2101. sterling for her own use and benefit. Several pecuniary legacies were then given to his relatives, and the residue was disposed of in favour of his wife. In the first codicil, dated the 28th of March, 1850, he stated that, notwithstanding the persecution and bad conduct of his daughter, it was not his desire to go out of the world without showing her some mark of his forgiveness, and he therefore desired his trustees and executors to stand possessed of 1,0001. Bank annuities to pay the dividends to her during her life, and after her decease to divide the principal betwocen three of her children, with benefit of sarvivorship. In the event of all three pre-deceasing, their mother, then the principal was to fall into the residue. Further legacies were also given to his relatives and friends. The third codicil, dated the 13th of March, 1851, empowered the executors and treeless to apply the dividlends of the legacies given to his grandchildren for their maintenance, education, &c., and one-third of the principal for their advancement in the world.
Dr. ADlMIAs with whom was Dr. Spinks, appeared on bebalf of the Viscountess de Beauchesne, and submitted that after the dec ision in "Lauenville v. Anderson," and the confirmation of the judgment by the Judical Committee, without hearing counsel for the respondents, it was qtite idle to argue this ase at length. I the deceased was domiciled i France, cadet qustie; but if the Court was of opion that by thejus gentium only he was domiciled in France the competent forum to try the validity of the will was in that country, He prayed the Court to follow the precedent in -Hare v. Nasmyth" (2 Addams, 21), and
De Boreval v. De Bonneval" (1 Curteis, 856).
The AnaflRALTy AflVOCATs (with whom was Dr. Twiss) Contended, on the part of Mr. Hodc'soa, that the deceased
having orginally an Anglo-Indian domicile never acquired a French domicile; that, according to the facts of the case, euv da domicile in France ue gentim, and in
dhe be said to have a domicile there. If he
failed on these points, then he contended that there was no i distinction between this case and "1 Freemau v. Bresmer."

M1 RSION-HOUSE.-Elizabeth Jones, EImma Haden, and Margaret Hughes were charged before the LoRn MAYOR with having robbed two ladies of two purses, one containing 30s. and the other Is.
Mtichael Haydon, City detecive, who had been watching the prisoners, saw them about 2 o'clock on the previous afternoon surround a lady near Bread-street, and hie EaW Jones put her hand into the lady's pocket. They then went off, and he spoke to the lady, who founld her purse was gone, and he followed them into Bow-lane, and on seizing Haden he told her he wanted the lady's purse. Sheexolaimed "I don't know what you mean," but she was seeni atthe moment to drop the purse, which was identified by Mrs. M'Andrew, a widow lady residing at Dalston, and who was the lady referred to. It contained the shiDing.
Another constable, named Green, proved that he saw the prisoners try the pockets of several ladies in St. Paul's Churchyard, and at the corner of Friday-street he saw Haden put her hand into the pocket of a lady's dresc. They all three spoke to the lady, and after they had left he spoke to her, and she found she had been robbed of her pu rse with 30s. in it HIe went after the prisoners, but they managed to elude him.
Mrs. Rees, the lady referred to, corroborated this statement.
The prisoners, who stoutly denied their guilt of this second charge, but admitted having stolen Mrs. M'Andrew's purse, were remanded.

The evidence was gone into at some length, and the prisoner was committed for trial.
Lady Charlotte Proby has sent, through Coutts and Co., .l for the poor-box of this court.
WoRsHr-sTREsET.-oseph Wiliams, a letter-sorter in the General Post-office, was charged, at the instance of the parish authorities of Shoreditch, with endangering the life of is son by neglect and insu11icient food.
Mr. Lewis, of Ely-place, attended for the defence.
Mr. Bartlett, the relieving officer, stated,-Having received information of the condition of the defendant's son, I and two other officers proceeded to his house in Bridport. place, Hoxton, and, on seeing his wife, asked her to accompany us to the kitchen. She said she was afraid, and did not go; and on our doing so we found the son, a lad of 18, sitting by a small fire, covered vwith vermin, and in a most dirty and filthy condition, clothes and all. I spoke to him, but could scarcely get a word out of him. On going upstairs to his bedroom we found his bed in a most filthy state also; it was a flock bed, from which half the flock had fallen out, and appeared as though it had been so for months past. The window was onen, but the room seemed as though it had not been cleaned for six months, and to be filthy from natural causes. I could only find one blanket there, and that was so filthy I could not handle it; indeed, I was glad to get out of the room after being there only about three minutes. We took the boy to the workhouse, where I saw him stripped, and found him emaciated, with sores all over his thighs, as if from scratching himself; all the lower part of the body had fallen in, as it were. I saw the water after he had had a bath, and it was as black as my hat. I afterwards went to the defendant's house, and asked him to come before the comrnittee, and he did so, and said as a reason for the boy's state that he was imbecile, and that his wife was not rigbt in her mind.
Cross-examined.-There were a carpet, chair, and table in the room; the boy had stockings, boots, shirt, and iacket on, and they would have been qusite good enough for him, if they had only been clean; but he was swvarming with verniiu when we went into the kitchen; and when I heard him speak two days after entering the workhouse he stiU seemed weak.
Maveety, 43 N.-I went with the last witness; the kitchen smelt very strong; indeed, the house smelt fear-
tUly. A little girl was in the house, who did not appear to have anything the matter with her * but the nails of the boy's toes were an inch long, grOWing into each other, and, though his skin appeared helh,Isod ik ewa next to a skeleton. ealthy, I should e was
Annie Raby, nurse in the workhouse.-I saw the lad when he was brought in; his hair was matted, he was wonderfuly filthy, and when he ate his food he appeared fatisued.
Mr. William Lewis.-I keep a publichouse next door to the defendant, and first saw this lad about 10 or 12 months ago. He appeared to be vacant, but was lively and in good condition. He used to play about, and conversed politely with me. There are six or seven more children, Lis brothers and sisters, in the house, together with the defendant. Two months ago I noticed that the lad declined. When bread and butter was given him he would appear afraid to eat it, looked up at the window of his own house, and went to the dustbin to eat it. He used to ask the servant for bread as she carried the broken victuals to the fowls. I once saw him carrying a coalscuttle from the area,and he-seemed bent double by it. I informed the parish authorities of the lad's condition, and the defendant came to ask me about it. I told him I considered he was starving the boy to death, and be saidt ' I do not, and when I am at home I carry his dinner down myself." I told him he was his own son, and asked why he did not allow hiiii to come to his own table, and he replied, " No, not such a dirty fellow as he is.' The defendant has eight children, I believe, and the others are apparently in good health, bat I have seen one of them, a girl, laughing and mocking at the boy on account of the vermin ,ipon hiuL
George Clayton, barman to Mr. Lewis. -I have seen bread and butter given to this lad, and he would take it away, that he might eat it at the dustbin.
Mr. Clark, the medical officer.-I examined this boy and found him of weak inteUect, though not altogether imbecile bat I think his evidence could not be depended upon. When I saw him he had been washed, but his hair had not been cut; it was long, matted, filed with vermin, and his hair was thickly covered with ropes of their eggs. The scIlp was torn, his skin, even after the washing, was stiU dirty, and presented slight abrasions over the whole surface. He was emaciated-considerably so ; his belly was shrunken and brown, and his ribs stood out in greater relief than in ordinary persons. The legs were thin, and there was an evident want of muscle all over the frame. The nails were long, and the clothes evinced indications of great neglect. I attribute the emaciation more to the want of food than uncleanliness, though uncleanliness, in persons of weak health in part produces emaciation. A room like that described by the officers would tendto increase emaciafion. I believe that since he has been in the workhouse his habits have been perfectly clean.
The lad was here brought forward and questioned by the magistrate. He said, in a very weak voice, that he did not know how he became so dirty, as he used to wash himself. He used to go to school while at Stoke Newington, and could read a little. A Bible was shown him, and he made out and speIt the word "now." On being questioned about
his dirty hbitshe denied them. On being asked bv Mr. Lewis, the solicitor, if his father and mother treated him kindly, he at first replied in the afirmative, but. o. being asked who it was that neglected him, he said his mother
Mr. D'EYNCoURT said the lad must be instructed, and ordered the defendant to be remanded upon bail,-two sureties in 201. each.
Mr. Lewis.-Or one in 401. will do ?
Mr. D'EYNcoURT.-No, I must have two.
Mr. Lewis.-Why, where is the difference, Sir?
Mr. D'EYxcouvr.-A great one; it will show that two persons, instead of one, have confidence in hi,u, and think he will not run away.
CLERKENWVELL.-A rough, dirty-looking fellow. well known to the police, who gave the name of Thomas Evans Bignold, was charged with committing a murderous assault upon his wife, Henrietta Bignold.
It appeared from the evidence of the wife, who gave her statement with soine reluctance, and who aDpeared in the witness-box with one of her eyes closed, and the right side of her face with much the appearance of liver, that her husband had been out of employment for some time, during which period he had given way to habits of intoxication. On Monday last he obtained a little work as a painter, and on Thursday he went home to his tea in the evening, and then went to the publichouse and got the worse for liquor. On his return, about 12 o'clock at night, she was in bed, when he th-ew himself down and asked her if she and ber family were hungry. She replied in the affirmative, when he said he would give her something that would Rtop it, and then he got up and brutally assaulted her, struiek her on the eye, and knocked her down. Maynard, 102 E, was then called and took the prisoner into custody. This was not the first time he had assaulted her.
The prisoner, when caUed upon for his defence, said he was the worse for liquor at the time, but he did not care, and should certainly feel obliged if the magistrate would favour him with six months. He knew what it was, as he had been there before.
Mr. TYRwnirir sentenced him to three months' imprisonment with hard labour in the House of Correction, and kindly directed that something should be given to his wife for the support of her family from the poor-box.
TnsAIES.-Thomas Bell, the unfortunate man charge-I on the previous day with sending tbreatening letters to Lord John Russell, was brought before Mr. SELFE, at the instigation of the Home Seretary, to enable the magistrate to inquire as to the state of his mind, and with a view to his future disposal.
Mr. Thomas Meares. of Brick-lane, surgeon, stated that he had examined Mr. Beli on Friday and again that morning, and found that he laboured under a delusion that Lord John Russell had disseminated slanders respecting him, and had employed persons to infuse poison into his food and medicine. He admitted the authorship of the letters. Ee was satisfied that he was a lunatio, and that, as his insanity might assume a dangerous form, he ought to be put under restraint.
The prisoner, who appeared firm and coUceted, demanded upon what grounds the surgeon came to the conclusion that he was of unsound mind?
On having the last letter he vrote to Lord John Russell put into his hand, he admitted it was his writing, and then went offinto his delusion that he had been slandered, and that persons had been employed to poison him by his Lordship. He repeatedly declaredthatthey were "merandott"
slanders, and that Lord John Russell deserved the "1 mner-
candott" medicine, as he had several times threatened to
check the slanders, but without effect, as Lord John " Mer-
candott" Russell had repeated them at Dover-house to Lord Dover, attached to an embassy, and others, and he
wished Lord John Russcll to be smnmoned as a witnwss to tee if he could deny it.
In reply to the magistrate as to wblat was- mhesntby the term " 3ercandoti'," he used so often, he said, " mercandott is an ash plant-a stick. Mercandott medicine should be spplied to his Lordship.
Ihe magistrate said he felt no hesitation i maing out an order for the removal of the unfortunate man to Coneybatch Lunatio Asylun, where he hoped his mental and bodily health would improve.
Mr. Bell, on hearing this, exclaimed thatthe decision of the magistrate was an act of tyranny and injustice, as they bad not put Lord J. Russell into the box, andasked if there wasno appeal against his decision.
Mr. SELFE feared not, unless any of his friends coidd obiain a writ of habeas corpus from a judge, to decide whether he was properly confined in a lunatic asylum.
Mr. BeTL-That would be attended with great expense, I telieve, Sir?
The Magistrate.-No, not much expense.
The order was made out, and the unfortunate man was removed to the asylum.
SormwAmc.-John Tobin, George Broderick, John Davis, and John Vernon, were finally examined before 31r. BunRc r, charged with stealing a large quantity of hide pieces of considerablevalue fromathe premises of Mir. Arthur Waring, hide-merchant and dresser, Spa-road, BermondEey, and Messrs. James Proctor and AlfredBevington, hidemerchants and glue-manufacturers, Grange-road, Bermondsey, appeared on their recognizances to answer the charge of receiving the same, well knowing it to be stolen.
MIr. Bodkin, instructed by Mr. Wontner, again attended for the prosecution, and Mr. Robinson, instructed by MIessrs Slee and Robinson, of Parish-street, Southwark, for Messrs. Proctor and Bevington.
The prosecutor stated that within the last seven months he had engaged premises in the Spa-road adjoining Mr. Barrow's. He was a hide and skli merchant, and had done a great deal of business with the defendants Messrs. Proctor and Bevington, whom he always knew to be gentlemen of respectability. They were glue-merchauts, and purchased glue pieces. Tobin had been in witness's employ and was discharged at the commencement of the frost, and after that he had no business on tbe premises. In consequence of missing a large quantity of hide pieces t the latter part of January he had his premises watched, and on the afternoon of the 31st he saw a truck in the possession of the police with a quantity of his glue pieces. After that, from information he received, he went with Inspector Mackintosh to Messrs. Proctor and Bevington's. He first saw the foreman, who weighed the goods, and he fetched the latter defendants to him. He told them that he understood they had been purchasing some hide pieces belonging to him, and that it was a very serioug affair; also that he should like to see the vouchers they received with them, and how much they gave for them. Mr. Bevington said that they purchased a quantity of glue pieces, and that he gave 32s. a-hundredweight for them. Witness said, " Good God, Mr. Bevington, is it possible that you take such goods in at that price without any vouchers, as my traveller, Mr. M'Laughln, only a few days ago sold your traveller a ton of the same quality for 751., and you were to send for them ?"h Mr. Bevington replied, that he was not aware of that. Witness asked what quantity he purchased, when he produced invoices of 8 cwt., purchiased of John Tobin, at 32s. a-cwt. Witness then called forward Inspector Mackintosh, and they went and seized the goods, which the police conveyed awvay. The defendants told him they often purchased small lots of hide or glue pieces, which they used in manufacturing glue, and they supposed the pieces were purchased in the usual way. The fair market value of them was at that time about 80L. a-ton, and they were used in maklng a particular kind of size.
Henry Hunt, 34 X said on the 31st of January he watched the prosecutor's premises, and about lO in the morning he saw TIhin go through Mr. Barrow's yard into Mr. Waring's. Vernonwas withhim at thetime, and they both left about 1 o'clock. At 4 o'clock witness saw a truck brought in by a man named Butler, followed by Tobin and Vernon. They loaded it with hide pieces from Mkr. Waring's shed. At 6 o'clock he saw all the prisoners together an the gateway, and a few minutes after that Davis and Broderick brought out the truck laden with hide pieces. They went up the Grange-road, where Tobin and Vernon were. Witness followed them, and stopped them. He asked Broderick whence he brought the truck and contents. He replied that they had been employed by a tai man to remove them. The prisoners were after that secured, and the contents of the truck were identified by the prosecutor. Smith, 165 M, assisted him in apprehending them.
Thomas Merriman, a greengrocer in the Spa-road, said that Tobin employed him and his horse and cart to remove a quantity of hide pieces from Mr. Waring's premises on the 29th and 30th of January. Vermon was in his company, and went with him to Messrs. Proctor and Bevington s, in the Grange-road. On the road Tobin told him to say, if any questions were asked, that the hide pieces came from Edwards, of Croydon. He took the property and delivered it at Messrs. Proctor's, when Tobis went into the countinghouse, and afterwards returned and paid witness for his horse and cart. As be was going away, Mr. Neale, the foreman, came towards him and asked him if the goods were all right. He told him he believed they were.
Mr. BURCHAIs asked him wlhether he really thought so, after being told by Tobin to say the goods came from Edwards, of Croydon?
He replied that he really believed they were all right.
A number of other witnesses were examined, showing that Tobin, assisted by the others, bad removed several bundles of hidepieces from MIr. Waring's premises since his discharge from his employ.
His worship committed all the prisoners for tr.al, admitting Messrs. Proctor and Mevington to baiL.
MIr. Buxetans has received 5l. per Messrs. Coutts and Co., for the poor-box, in the name of Lady Charlo,tte Proby.
LABETH.-George Wood, who has been before in custodyffor similar offences, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NORTON for further examination, charged with the commission of a savage assault on the person of Police-constable Peter Tyer, 169 L, while in the execution of his duty.
The officer who had charge of the case informed the magistrate that Tyer was in a dangerous state, and unable to appear, and handed in the following certificate from his medical attendant:-
I hereby certify that police-constable Peter Tyer, 169 Ia is unable to leave his houe. or walk, from tbe effects of injubies en he hack received while in the aerformaace of bis duty.
* Walcot-place-west. Feb., 28.", c. a BLAM5, Surgeon.
Mr. NORTON on remanding the prisoner to a future day rem arked that the most determined measures must be resorted to to check savage attacks on the police. There was at that moment lying dead as active and as excellent an officer as any belonging to the whole forc-he meant poor Jordan -through the brutality of a Crimean soldier, and there was no knowing how the present case might terminate.
The prisoner was remanded for a week.
Charles Elk-ins. and William Elkins, his brother, the associates of thieves, were charged with a violent outrage at the New Crown and Cushion publichouse, in the West. minster-road, better known as "Hart's night-bouse."
From the evidence it appeared that between the hours of 3 and 4 on that morning the prisoners, accompanied by a woman, entered the house in question, and, seeing there an Irish labourer, who had on a iormer occasion prevented the prisoner Charles from robbing a person in his company, he made a violent attack on him, and a desperate row ensued, and the prisoners were ultimately captured.
The prisoners complained of having been roughly used, and, judging from their marks, they appeared to have had the worse of the fight.
The prisoner Charles was committed for one month for assaulting a constable, and ordered to pay 51. or two months' imprisonment for assaulting apotboy, and Wil11am was fined 31., or one month, for assaulting Mr. Hart.
Ir. NOBTrON expressed a hope that a law would soon pass to close night-houses, and
Mr. Hart denied that his was a night-house, as he closed from 12 to 2, as well as his neighbours.

NORTHERN CIRCUIT. I
NRWCASTLE. FEB. 29
Mr. Baron Martin and Mr. Justiee Crompton arrived in this town, from Carlisle, yesterday afternoon, when their Lordships opened the eommission, and attended divine service at the parish church.
This morning Mr. Baron LARTIrN sat at the Town-hall, for the trial of the town prisoners, at 9 o'clock. The calendar contained the names of 11 prisoners and seven cases. None of them were of a serious character ; they were larcenies and assaults in the town. His Lordship having disposed of these cases came to the Mtoot-hall, to assist Mr. Justice CIrompton in the trial of the county prisoners.
The county calendar contain d the names of eight pri0ners only. Of these four were charged vith larceny, t wo with robbery, one with embezzlement, and one with coneealment of birth.
The cause list contains an entry of 11 causes for the town and siX for the county; of the former, three are marked for special juries. It is proposed that both the learned judges shal sit for the trial of causes on Monday morning.
THE foa or-rALL.-(Bcfore Msr. J,lstice CROMsprox.)
George Forster, aged 22, was indicted for embezzling the sum of 171. ls. 6d., the property of William and Isaac Cookson, his masters, at Oviiugham, onthel2th of December last.
The Hon. Adolphus LiddeU prosecuted, and Mr. Davison appeared for the defence.
it appeared that the prisoner was a " hurrier " in a coalpit at Zckley Colliery, of which Messrs William and Isaac Cookson were the proprietors. It appeared to be the custom of that colliery to pay the men by batches of a dozen with a paynote, on which was entered tise name of each man, and also the amount due to each. Any one of these men received the note by agreement amolg themselves, and got it cashed, and afterwards divided the money. On Saturday, the 12th of last December, the prisoner and 11 other men were thus elaseed together in a note on which 18t. 16s. 2d. was payable, the joint amount of their weekly wages. A man named Althar, one of these meu,had been accustomed to obtain the paynote and get it cashed, but that day, being in his working clothes, he asked the prisoner to do it for him, the prisoner's name being on the note. The prisoner obtained the note, showed it to Althar, and Althar asked him to take it to the cashier and get it cashed. This the prisoner did, but afterwards, and before he had divided the amounit he had received, he went off with the money. He was soon after apprehended, when he stated he had got the money, but bad spent it all but 11. 5s., which sum -was found upon him.
For the defence it was submitted that the prisoner received the money, nlot as the agent of the masters to pay the men, but as the agent of the men to divide it among them, and that the charge against him of embezzling his master's money was not therefore made out.
His LoRDsHais, having summed up, left it to the jury to say whether the prisoner had acted as the agent of the owners. If so they must find him guilty; if not they must acquit him.
The jury found the prisoner Gt illy, being of opinion that he acted as the agent of the owners to distribute the money.
He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, with hard labour.
John Johnson Walker was indicted for violently assaulting and robbing John Robinson, and stealing from his person the sum of 1151., at Loigheaton, on the Sth of January last.
Llr. Davison prosecuted, and Mr. Blackwell defended the prisoner.
From the statement of the learned counsel it appeared that the proseeutor had been in Newcastle upon the day in question for the purpose of recovering a suImI of 1201. from a building society; the money was paid to him in a check, which was afterwards exchanged for 23 St. Eank of England notes, and 5t. in gold. This occurred about half-past 2 o'clock, and having muade some trifling payments out of the money he left 2Newcastle in the evening, and about 20 minutes past 10 he had reached a place called Walk-er, three miles from the town, wben he was met by the prisoner at the bar, and after conversing together for somae little time they arrived at a place called Easeburn-bank, and suddenly the prosecutor feltthe prisouer place his left arm round his neck, and his knee against his hack, while wvith his right hand he tore open the prosecutor's trotsers' pocket and snatched away the banknotes, which were rolled together, and, .imping over a ditch, ran away. As soon as the prosecutor had recovered himself he pro. ceeded to time nearest police-station and gave information of the robbery, and on the following Sunday morning he was taken to the gaol at Morpeth, and there at once identified the prisoner out of -30 men in the yard. It seamed that the police, upon hearing of the robbery, had their attention aroused by learning that a man had been changing 51.-notes at publichouses within a few miles of the neighbourhood, and on tracing the prisoner he was eventually apprehended in a cart with 15 of the 5I. -notes upon his person, and some gold, making in all lOOt., the latter being secreted in the straw at the bottom of the cart. Upon being taken into custody the prisoner asserted that he had found the mnoney, and, upon the officer pointing out that even ander those circumstances he would not be justified in appropriating it to Ilis own use, the prisoner exclaimed that once, when in London, he had found 4001., and upon restoring it to the owner he had received but ls. The facts being fully proved against the prisoner,
The jury found him Gmsillp.
HIis Ldosunsass sentenced the prisoner to four years' penal
(Before Mir. Baron MARTiN.)
Thomas Wilson, a deaf and dumb man, was indicted for stealing a silver watch, the property of T'homas Charlton, at Allendale, on the 9th January last.
Mr. E. M. Fenwick prosecuted, and the prisoner was indefended.
It appeared from the evidence, which was communicated to the prisoner through an interpreter, that upon the afternoon of the 9th of January the prisoner caUed at the house of a person named Charlton, and found Mrs. Charlton alone, and upon making signs to her indicating that he was deaf ard dumb, which she could not comprehend, he drew from his basket a slate and wrote uponl it " that he was mnuch distressed, as the police had taken all his tliings in consequence of his having been found hawking without a license ;" and Mrs. Charlton not being able to read the writing sought the help of a neighbour, and it being rather dusky at the time the prisoner motioned to them to go nepr the door for better light, while he remained by the fireplace, and during this interval he took down a watch which was suspended over the mentel-piece, and after making signs that he was hungrv and rejecting some bread which had been offered to him heleft. As soon as the husband returned home in the evening ho missed his watch, and having suspected the prisoner, at once tracc-d him to alodginghouse at a place called Dirtpot, seven or eight miles off, asd fourd that the prisoner had arrived there about 9 o'clock and engaged a bed, and had hidden the watch in an empty bed in the same room. The evidence as to this point was given by a boy, a son of the landlady, who stated that he and his sister slept on onebed and the prisoner on another, and a third was empty; and about 10 o'clock he was aroused by tomne person knocking at the door of the house. (This was Charlton with a neighbour.) And he saw the prisoner get out of bed and come over to his bed and look whether he -as asleep, and immediately afterwards go across to the empty bed and then look out of the window. This information having hmeen given to Charlton the bed was searched andl the missing watch discovered, or, as he descrihed it, he "heard her going under tiie covering."
The learned JtrDCE having suiimmed up, the jury found the prisoner /uilty(.
IHis LoP.Djsiip then sentenced him to six calendarmonths and bard labour.
The criminal business was concluded to-day.

John Lewis, aged 39, a skinner, was arraigned upon an indictment charging him wvith having unlawfullv, and with malice aforethought, murdered his -wife, Gwenllian Lewis at Merthyr, on the 4th day of January last.
It appeared from the evidence that the deccased was servant to Mr. John Morgan, a solicitor at Merthyr, and that the prisoner and the deceased both lived in his house. On Sunday, the 4th of January, Mr. Morgan left home about 3 o'eclock and returned about 11, letting himself into the house with a latch-key. Find;ug that the fire was nearly out, he raug thebell rather violently,and in about a minute proceeded downstairs to the kitchen. The witness proceeded to describe 'what he saw on arriving there. He said,-'" I found the deceased lying down, with her husband holdin, her head up. I said to him, 'How is this, John ?I' I1
said, ' I don't know, indeed; I lhave been trying to get into the house all the evening; I knocked at the door many tuiies and could get no answer, and at last I went over the wall into the field, and burst open the back door of the offices, and I found her in her blood at the bottom of these stairs (the office stairs), and I brought her here.' She was tien lying in the kitchen some three or four yards distant. There are It steps. I ran for a doctor and went to bMr. Dike. He came as soon as possible and we both went baek to the front door of the office in Victoriastreet, which I opened vith a latch key. In conseqnence of what Mr. Dike told me I went to the police-offlce, and three officers same with me. I searched the houte, but missed nothing. My bed was not made, and the roorn had not been done up in my absence. On Saturday morning I gzve the deceased half a sovereign to go to market, and told her to settle with me in the evening. For some reason she did not do so. I found two pieces of pork and six potatoes in a vegetable dish to keep warm; it had not been toueked. The ordinary time for the prisoner to dine was between 1 and 2 o'clock. The joint of pork was roasting at 20 minutes to i o'clock, when I previonsiy went tMrough the kitchen. Access cannot be obtained through muy eoach-house to mv office. When I came honie I found the back door in the area behind my private house was on the latch, through which any person could bave got into the kitchen. There is a so a window there about 2A feet from the ground. Prisoner has been living in that house about six months. Both, however, have lived with me about threeyears." From the other evidence the presumption seemed to be that the deceased had beenL thrown downstair& A surgeoR gave his opinion that death was caused by a fracture of the temple, and that the body must have been thrown down witli great violence.
At the close of the proseeation, Mr. ALLEN addressed the jurv for the defence.
His LoBuDSIP summed up the evidence, and the jury left the court to consider their verdict. At half-past 10 they were not agreed, and the Court then adjourned to 9 o'clock on Saturday morning, the jury being locked up for 'he nht,
On Baturday morning the jury were called into the court son the arrival of the judge, and as they were unable to Agree, tf:ey were discharged. The prisoner will be tried again at the Summner Assizts, all the witnesses being b,gand Cm- to appe.: then.

The half-yearly meeting of this eompany was held on Saturday at the office, Great George-street, Westrmnster; Mr. Ayrton in the chair. '
Thse apital account sbowed that 149,8001. had been re ceived. and 50,9-251. expended, leaving a balance of 98,875s., of which 71,e50f. was deposited with the accountant-general and 27,612. at the bankers'. u
The CHxRAIsr%N explained that owing to the state of the money-market the efforts of Mr. Ricardo to assist the undertaking by guaranteeing certain shares had been unsuccessful. The company had borrowed 20,0001 from the London and Westminster Bank, 10,0001. of which had been paid to the corporation of London as a deposit for the purchase of land for vhich they were called upon to pay. The Sum of 5,0001. was in the hands of the Royal British Bank. The corporation of London were largely concerned in providing means of communication between the Cattle market in Copenhazeen-fields, and a proposed meat-market in Smithfield. Should the company be unable to go on they *vould have to apply to the accountant-general for a return of the deposit. He concluded by moving the adoption of the accounts.
Several shareholders expressed an opinion to the effect that as the project had not been sufficently supported by the public or the great railway companies, who it was supposed were interested in obtaining a city terminus, the only course left for the promoters was to abandon the project and wind up its affairs as soon as possible.
The CHAIRsMAX' thought it probable that in the course of six months he should be in a position to submit some definite question to the proprietors.
sMr. L SIMPSON, a director, stated that if thev ere nowv to wind up they would be enabled to return l5s. in the polnd.
Ur. J. L. RICARDO, Uf.P., entertained the same opinion of the undertaking as before, and would have done his best to assist in its completion; he was still ready to carry out his proposal, and to afford them any assistance in his power.
The statement of accounts was then adopted.
Mr. C. P'S WSOx entered at considerable length into various matters connected with the undertaking, and said, although he believed the corporation were disposed to deal fairly and liberally with them, he knew they would not give any pecuniary assistance to the undertaking. He recommended the directors to go to the corporation, to the Great Western, the Great Northern, and London and NorthWestern Railway Companies and say if they did not come forward to help them they would wind up the concern.
The retirtng directors, Mr. Ayrton and Mr. L. Simpson, and also the retiring autditor were re-elected.
A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings.
MID-KENT (BP.OMLEY TO ST. MARY CRAY).
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the offices, South Sea-hoase, on Saturday; Mr. W. Dent in the chair.
Mr. Woolcott, the secretary, read the report, which stated that in the last half-yearly report they were informed that a preliminary agreement had been entered into wvith the South-Eastern Railway Company for the working and maintenance of the line. A special meeting of the company was held on the 20th of October last for the purpose of confirming that agreement, but on the morning of that day it came to the klowledge of the directors that the SoathEastern Company had determined to applv to Parliament for pawers to construct a conipeting line fr6m Lewisham to Dartford, and it was thought advisable to postpone the confirmation of the agreement. The dir2otors stated that all mention of this competing line was carefully suppressed at thesr numerous interviews with the South-Eastern board, before the prelininariesofthe workingagreementwerearranged, without which they had avowed to thsat board their intention not to take their Bill. The East Kent Company had now a Bill before Parliament for making a railway from Strood to St. Mary Cray, and should they obtain the Act the Bromley and St. Mary Cray line would become an important seetion of a continental trunk line. Satisfactory arrangements had been come to by the East Kent and Crays Compan;es with the West-end RailwvayCompany, for obtaining access inmb London totally independent of the SouthEastern Company to London-bridge, Waterloo-bridge, and Sloane-street. By the end of the present year the West-end and St. MIary Cray lines would he completed for traffic. The capital account to the 51st of December showed that 10,9311, had been received, and 4,210l. expended, leaving 5,2a0I. in the hands of the accountant-general, and1,4.70. at tbe bankers.
The CHAIRs31AN, in moving the adoption of the report, said they had reason to believe that the line would be opened from Bromnley to St. Mary Cray by the end of the ear; that the East Kent extension from Strood to St. ary Cray would be granted. Hte thought the SouthEastern Company had better look the dificulty in the face and at once make terms with them and the other companies. lie believed the East Kent, the St. Mary Cray, and Westend Railway Companies would he ready to listen to reasonable terms.
The report was adopted, and the retiring directors, Mr. Dent and Mr. Treadwell, were re-elected.
The adjourned special meeting was then held to consider the propriety of confirming the provisional agreement enterediinto with the South-Eastern Company for working the line.
Mr. T. ATKINSON said they were about to read a lesson to a great company as to keeping faith with a smaller company. The aggressive policy of the South-Eastern Company, by means of a comnpetin,g line, now threatened his property in the St. Mary C :ay line, and if carried out it was calculated, from the close proximity of the competing line to absorb all their traffic. That grsat company had broken faith vith them, and were it not for the proposal of the East Kent Company to joiu them at St. Mary Cray, and the arrangement with the West-end Company they might be utterly without traffic, and under those circmitances they were bound in both a money aud moral point of view to reject tbe eagreement. He concluded by moving a resolution to the effect that it was inexpedient to confirn the provisional agreement made between the South Eastern and St. Mary Cray Company, dated the 10th of April, 1856, and that the sanme be rejected accordingly.
Mr. G. B. GREGORY seconded the motion, and it was carried uanimously.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceediDgs.
EAST KENT.
The half-yearly mieeting of this company was held on Friday, at the London Davern; Lord Sondes in the chair.
An abstract of the report has appeared in The Times.
The CHAIsTOAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said that the works on the line were progressing favourably, and that the whole concern was in as flourishing a condition as they could expeeb.
Mr. C. M. LiSumN/}TON, 3M.P., seconded the motion, and called attention to the fact that the South-Eastern Conipany at their last half-yearly meeting had admitted that the traffic on the North Kent line was so great that they intended to apply to Parliar-ent to authorize a relief line fromi Dartford to Levwisham. This, however, did not rmeet the requirements of the East Kent, nor did it give the public the accommodation of a West-end terminus. (Eear, hear.) When the East Kent had a West-end terminus they would be independent of the South-Eastern, and be able to cor vey their passengers to within a quarter of an hour's ride of Buckinehain Palace and Pall-mall. (EHear, hear.)
Mr. HARrsTRiDcE deprecated the making of any branches in the presert state of the money-market.
Air. CsRcA;PTON considered that the proposed line from Strood to St. Mary Crsy would be a valuable adjtunct to the F,ast lKent line, which lhe considered was one of the best lilnes in the kingdom, and that it would pay S or 9 per cenl.
After some observationis from Sir J. TYLDEN and other proprietors, the report was unanimously adopted.
The retiring directors and auditor were re-elected, the forfeiture of certain shares confirmed, and a vote of tbanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.
WHITEHAVEN INCTION.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Wbitehaven on Friday, the Earl of Lonsdale in the chair.
Afr. H. Cook, secretary, having read the notice convening the meeting, the report and accounts, an abstract of which has appeared in Tle Times, were taken as read.
The ClIAIBNIAN, in proposing the adoption of the report said that the accounts would allowof a better dividend than at their last meeting. Their revenue hai increased 25 per cent. since that time, and their working expenses wee- only 3 per c-nt. in excess. Though a searching investigation was made into their accounts six months ago by Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and other gent3emen, they failed to discover all their liabilities, and, though those which had since bcen found out only amounted to a limited sum, still, had it not been for those items, their balance on revenue account would have been higher by 25 per cent. It was fair to state that, as their capital was exhausted, there had been several sums paid out of revenue which in ordinary cases would be paid out of capital. Among these were the cost of new sidings ard of a new locomiotive engine. If they had had capital to charge those sums to, they would have been in a position to pay a dividend of 14s. per share, instead of 7s. The revenue for the first seven weeks of the present half-year was 26 per cent. more than for the ocorresponding period of the last half-year. It was probable that if the traffic went on they would have to ask for power to double their line.
Mr. ARmiTSTEAD seconded the motion, which was carried without opposition.
A dividend at the rate of 7s. per share, less income-tax was then declared, and the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
WHITEHA-VEN, CLEATOR, AND EGREEMONT.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Whitehaven on Friday; Mr. A. B. Steward in the ohair.
The report stated that the working agreement entered into with the Whitehavent and Furness Junction Railway on the 13th of November last had been appioved by the Board of Trade. Additional sidings and other works were now in course of construction.
The CQIAIRIMAN proposed the adoption of the report,
wbich, after being seconded by Mr. J. H. RoBnr?soxV was unanimoudly agred to.
A dividead at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, less income-tax, was then declared, and the proceedings terminated
BRISTOL AND EXETER.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at Bristol; Mr. J. W. Buller in the chair.
Mr. M. CASTLE, a director, in the absence of the secre-
tary, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Timac.
The CEHATRvA, in moving the adoption of the report, expres ed the very great regret he and his colleagues felt at the serious illness of their worthy secretary, who had been
completelg identified with aU their interests from the commencement, and had most materially coatributed to promote the prospenty of the company. The proposed increase of tIe idend to 5 per cent. could be most confidently recommended. It had stood at 4 1 per cept. for some years, the
practice of the board being to endeavour steadily to mainvain the dividend, from the coxiviption that every undertaking was more prosperous an& likely to attract a more permanent proprietary if the dividend were equalized, Xatier than liable to sutdden and " Sn ZL,2 faIctuations,
They had liquidated a large gum on spenso account charged against revenue, and he hoped it wouldvnever again be necessary to have recourse to such a mode of postponing the payment of debts. (Hear, hear.) The presentidividend had been most fairly earned. The capital account was drawing nearly to a conelusion. The principal amouut charged to capital during the half-year was 16,0001. for engines and plant, and he trusted they now had a sufficient number of carriages and amount of plant to work the traffic. During the last half-year 14 miles of single line had been relaid. Every exertion was made by the directors to keep the line in the best possible condition, and at the same time to control the expenditure. It was satisfactory to knowv that this line was so situated as to commanda considerable traffiboth in peace and war. With regard to the completion of the Cornwall line it was their interest, as well as that of the Great Western and South Devon Companies, to give the necessary assistance for that purpose, and to enable the
Cornwall Company to raise the money. The object was to I complete the line with the least possible delay, and the first thing was to finish the works on the Albert-bridge, which
had already occupied a considerable time. He was glad to i say that the Plyimouth and Great Western Docks, in which they had an interest, were now completed. The very moment the graving dock was opened it was occupied by a large vessel, and he understood two others were waiting to take her place. The disposable balance would have enabled the directors to declare a dividend of 2§ per cent. for the past half-year, and to carry over 3,7451., but they thought it more prudent to carry forward a large balance ro the least productive half-year, and thus secure, if possible, the continuance of a5 per cent. dividend. (Hear, hear.)
MLr. J. POOLE, jun., seconded the motion for the adoption of the report.
Mr. Tuexvrr thought it would be much better to divide each half-year what they really earned, rather than to attempt to keep up a certain permanent dividend.
Ia reply to a question, it was stated that the Cornwall Company proposed to raise about 300,0001., of which the Bristol and Exeter Company would guarautee about 100,0001.; theinterestwould be paid out of capital during the construction, and out of revenue when the line was open for traffic.
Mr. HARE and Mr. T. PONVELL objected to increase the stake of the company in the Cornwall PRailway, which now amounted to 450,0001.
Mr. AVERY and other shareholders contended that the indirect advantages to the Exeter line would compensate them to a great extent.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend of 21 per cent. for the half-year, re-electing the retiring direcwtrs and tuditor, raising his remuneration from 1l01. to 2001. per annum ; and authorizing the proposition respecting the Cornwall Railway.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
SOUTH DEVON.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was on Tuesday, at Plymouth; Mr. T. Woolcombe in the chair.
The Secretary read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in Tka Times.
The CHAIR.MxANx, in moving the adoption of the report, said he trusted the accounts would be satisfactory, for they showed a very much larger increase of dividend than he had ever submitted to them before. The receipts on the line had gradually increased from 1,601. per mile in 1851 to 2,30 71. in 1856. They should bear in mind that after the 15th of March the holders of half-shares, in addition to the receipts of 10s. 9d. per slsare, would participate rateably in the whole earnings of the conipany after payment of the preferential charges. The present dividend must not be considered as a criterion for ensuing half-years, bub he hoped in the course of a few years, from the steady increase of trafSc, they would be enabled to declare a dividend generally equal to the present one. In consequence of the proximity of the South )Devon RailAvay to the sea they were more subject to contingencies than any other company, and ho thought at some future time, in order to eoualize the charge of maintenance, the directors would probably recommend the establishment of a fund similar to that adopted by shipping companies to insure their own vessels, so that in case of any injury to the line from the sea during any half-year they woald have a fund to draw from instead of charging the extra cost to the half-year or spreading it over two or three half-years.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend of 12s. Gd. per 50l. share for the half-year, authorizing the directors to proceed, in conjunction with the Great Western and Bristol and Exeter companies, to obtaiu a modification in the existing agreement with the Cornwall Railway Company, so as to insure the completion of the CornwaU Railway, and to obtain the sanction of Parliament thereto, and authorizing the directors to negotiate terms for working the Exeter and Exmnath and Dartmouth and Torbay ravways.
The retiring directors and auditors were re-elected. The remuneration of the auditors was fixed at 601. per annum, and to be aUowed to travel free over the line when their duties required their attendance at the various stations on the line.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
SOMERSET CENTRAL.
The half-yearly meeting was held at Glastonbury on Saturday, Air. G. Warry, chairman of the board, presiding.
The report stated that the total receipts on revenue account during the past six snonths had been 1,9901., and the disposablebalance,including3681. from thepreceding account, was 1,5001. This would provide for a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent., and leave 1931. to the credit of the current half-year. Contracts of 4S,OOol. for the construction of the line to Wells and 20,0001. for the line to Burnham and a landing-pierhad been entered into with Messrs. Rig,by but, only 53,o001. out of the total share capital of 70,0001. authorized for these extensions having been subscribed, it had been detormined only to proceed for the present with the extension to Burnham. The extension to Bruton would be commenced early in the ensuing summer. The capital account showed a total receipt of 97,1001., of which 9S,0151. had been expended, leaving a balance of 2,0351.
Resolutions, declaring a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, less income-tax, approving the BiU of the Dorset Central for the Blandford and Bruton extension, and resolving to take powers hereafter, if expedient, to lay down the narrow gauge over this line, re-electing the retiring directors and auditor, were then passed, aixd a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.
NEWPORT, ABERGAVENNY, AND HEREFORD.
The half-yearly meeting of tlis company was held on Friday at the London Tavern; Lthe Won. . E. Fitzmaurice in the chair.
Mr. Pritehard, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the line from Crumlin to the Taff-vale junction would be completed in August next. Since the last meeting, in August last, a further sum had been received of S4,135C. on the 6 per cent. preference shares, of which surm 71,812l. had been expended. The amount stiU to be paid, under vote of the shareholders, was 180,7181., which would be covered by the remaining caU on the 6 per cent. preferei,ce stock, and the exercise of the borrowing powers of the Taff-vale Extension Act. The gross receipts of the line for the half-year ending the 31st of December amounted to 28,1061., and were 7,7071. in excess of those at the corresponding period of 1855, and the expenses to 14,8161., the net income leaving 13,2901., over 40 miles of road. To this sum was added 2541., rents of tramaroad, and 5,2101. from the preceding account, making 18,7541. From this was deducted 5,7431. interest on bonds, 2,2351. interest on S per cent. preference shares, and 3,2311. interest on 6 per cent. preference shares, leaving 7,5441. to the credit of revenue. The working expenses for the halfyear ending 31st December amnounted to 52,71 per cent. of the gross earnings, against 57.38 per cent. at the corresponding period of 1855. It was proposed to create a further sum of 77,1401. preference capital to provide working stock. The company had applied for powers to extend their railway into the Aberdare and Bargoed Valleys. The capiWal account showed that 1,072,5101. had been received, and 1,071,4031. expended, leaving a balance of 1,1071.
The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said, the available balance would have been larger, had it not been for the high rates they had to pay for money. If they coald have obtained money at a reasonable rate the works would have proceeded more rapidly, and they would now be in the receipt of a handsorne dividend. Arrangements had been made with the Ebbw Vale company, by which a traffic of lo,OOOl. a-year would be secured to the line. The traffic from the Sirhowey, the Nantyglo, the Tredegar, and Rhumnney Companies would also be very considerable, Since the company had crept into the district a new mining district altogether had been opened in the Aberdare Valley. The population had considerably increased within a comparatively short period, and there were 130 different furnaces now in operation. The Rhymney and Aberdare districts were rising to a state of great prosperity, which could not fal to increase the traffic on their railvay. The greatest possible economy had been exercised in working the line, the traffic upon which now averaged 1,100?. per week. It only re uired 1,5001. a-week to give therm a dividend at the rate of I3per cent, Per annum oni the old shares. The prejudices of local parties againist the line were being gradually removed, and trade was springing uip in places where it never existed before; and if they could induce certain wealthy men to send the traffic fromn their works over the railway the revenue of the company would be considerably increased.
A dSiscussion ensued; afteor which forusal resolutions were passed in conformity with the report, and the proc.ee.dings ,concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairmnan,
SOUTEI YORKSHIRL.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Friday at the London Tavern; Dr. Dymond in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in TVi 2'ismsee was taken as read.
The CiiAIRNL&a, in moving the adoption of the report, said -he did not expect the working expenses would be much lower than they were at present-about 53 per cent. on the receipts, in consequence of the steep gradients they had to work.a-oer. He congratulated the shareholders on the incr-ease of the coal traffic, and stated that the increase of 1,W000. in the passenger traffic was attributable to the opening of the line to Thorne. A quiestioni had been raisedL as to thze letalit:y of subscribing 25,0001. towarads the prchase of steam oat, but whether the transaction was legal or nob a remuneratice dividend had been earned by the outlay, and 6 per cent. had been laid by for depreciation. Hc read a letter fiom. Mr. Hadfield, LP., complaining of the mismanagement of t*e line, and particularly of the investment of 2.5,000?. in steamboat shares, which he (Mr. Hadfield) contended was illegal.
A long discuss.ion ensued, in the course of which it wvas contended by MLr. PRhodes and other shareholders that
although the mnine2al trffic brad incereased, the dividends had decreased. This wtas attribuYed to the COslowners having considerable influence at t(he boa3rd and in the management
hlr. BAXrsst defended the dire'ctors, and contended that the coalowners at the beard were ~n advantage to the company, The three great companie.; charged Ad,d per ton per mile, while South Yor'-shire charged ld. per tonpe mile on the average. Notwvitmsant,'ing adverse circm-
stances, they had got the line to pay 4 ncr centt., althlough Ihe considered it ought topay 6 per eent. to renunerate the proprietors, With regard to tfie er~ime cfd 25,0Q9){, in
the steamnpackec company, they had power to subscribe it
under the Canal Act; they were not merely railway pro-1 prietors but also canal proprietors, and they had a legal riht to make such au investment to convey their traffic.
'r. PinIsori, seconded by Sir R. Carden, moved a resolution to the effect that the position of a coalowner on the railway was incompatible with the proper discharge of his duties as a director, and that the gentlemen who now occupied the former position should retire from the board, aud tbatacommnittee be appointed to inquireintotbevarious matters relating to the coal traffio and the steamboats.
Another long discussion then ensued, in the course of which an amendment, by Mr. Rhodes, for adopting the portion of the report relating to the dividend, and referring the matters relating to the 25,0001. for steamboat shares to the directors, and Mr. Hadfield to take legal opinions on the subject, was rejected by 19 against 13, and the report
adopted. I
The dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum was 1 declared on the guaranteed and ordinary shares for the past half-year, the retiring directors and auditor were re-elected, and the meeting separated.
HULL AND HOLDERNESS.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursday at Hull, Mr. Bannister in the chair.
The report stated that 4,2561. had been expended on capital account during the past half-year. The revenue for the half-year ending December 31 showed that 6,7271. had been received, being 1711. less than at the corresponding period of 1855. The directors had been unable to complete the negotiations pending for the leasing of the line, bat they entertained confident hopes that at no distant date they might have satisfactory proposals to submit to the shareholders. To lessen the large balance due to their bankers, the directors had made a transfer of the rolling stocks, and now had the exclusive use of it on payment of an annual interest of 5 per cent. The balance at the disposal of the shareholders was 2,1561., out of which the directors recommended the payment of a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, amounting to 2,1361., and leaving 201.
On the motion of the chairman, seconded by Mr. Pease the report was adopted, and the dividend declared. The retiring directors, Mr. Bannister and Mr. Cautley, were re-elected, And Mr. J. S. Thompson was re-elected auditor.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.
BIRKENHEAD, LANCASHIRE, AND CHESHIRE
JU.NCTION.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Birkenhead. The chair was occupied by Mr. W. Titherington.
The report stated that the total amount of capital chargeable on the revenue was 2,318,1051. The amount expended on the capital account during the half-year was 34,6111. The receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of December, 1856, were:-Passengers, 36,1421.; goods, 34.3641. ; tot, 1 70,5061. ; ditto for the half-year ending the 31st of Decem-
ber, 1855, 59,2061. Increase :-Passengers, 1,2071.; goods, 10,0931. ; total, 11,3001.

The balance out of the past half-year's working available for dividend, after setting aside 2,5001. towards the renewal fund, is 32,9561., out of wvhich the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 3.1 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 1,4071.
The CHATR,Lay, in moving the adoption of the report, 1 congratulated the meeting on the brighter prospects of the company, which now assumed a position it had not hitherto been able to attain. He had always told them that if the company was to remain independent they must increase their capital account to not less than 2,500,0001., and it had not yet reached that by 120,0001.
Mr. WAT3cILS seconded the motien, which was carried
The Rev. W. BURLEY moved a resolution to the effect that in the opinion of the meeting it was inexpedient to continue abortive negotiations for amalgamation, and that, while affording to the Great Western Conspany every facility which they can in reason ask, the directors of the company be instructed to cultivate aa2icable relations with other neigbouring companies, and to promote the permanent interests of the company.
Mr. BELOz seconded the proposition.
Mr. TAtrTOo i moved an amendment to the effect-
"That thii meeting having a fu2l regard to the improved positioon of the comnvay since kr. Atkinson's election to the chair, aoprove of the management adopted by hinm, and hope that Mr. Titherington and the beard winl pursue the same course."
Mr. SALIsnURY seconded the amendment.
Mr. Taunton's amendment was put to a show of hands, and lost by 21 to 34; and the original motion, by Mr. Burley, was carried by 29 to 21.
Mr. Su.Isst,ltY demanded a poll.
Scrutineers were then appointed, and it was resolved to take the result on Wednesday afternoon.
The dividend, as recommended in the report, was then adopted.
The meeting was made special, to take into consideration the draught of a Bill authorizing the company to purchase steamboats for carrying stock across the river to Birkenhead.
| On the proposition of Mr. BELOB the meeting was ad1 journed until Wednesday, at 1 o'clock.
The meeting then broke up.
SHREWSBURY AND WELSHPOOL.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Friday, at Shrewsbu-ry. Earl Powis presided.
The secretary read the report, which calls attention to the necessity of raising the remainder of the capital, in order that the hoard may be in a position to proceed with the undertakring in the present year. The works upon the lOswestry and Newtown line will probably be commenced i very shortly, which will tend to the advantage of this company.
The accounts showed that 12,9821. had been received and 3,2501. expended, leaving a balanceof 9,726Z.
On the motion of the CHAIRIBALr, the report was adopted, and the retirin,g directors, Earl Pows, Mr. D. Pugh, M.P., and MIr. Mlytton, were re-elected. Mr. Blakemore was reappoilled auditor.
The proceedings terminated with a vote of thauks to the chairman.
BORDER COUNTIES.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was heldin Hexham on Tuesday, Mr. Charlton in the chair. From the report read it appeared that a considerable portion of the permanent way between Hexhamand Cunkirk was finished.
he rails for completing the permanent way from Hexham to Barrowford were in store. Arrangements were making for setting out the next section from Barrowford to illiungham.
e report was agreed to, and resolutions were adopted expressing the satisfaction that a favourable lino can he
procured for the ultimate extension of the railway into bcotIand. Messrs. Robson and Lowdon were re-elected directors, and Mr. J. Batey auditor, and the proceedings terminated.
WEST HARTLEPOOL.
The annual meeting of this company was held on Fridav at the offices, West Hartlepool; Mr. l1. W. Jackson in the chair. The business was merely of a formal nature, it having been resolved to adjourn the meeting to another day in order that the proposals from the North-Eastern Railway Company for a permanent amalgamation with this company, and which are now assuming a definite aspect, may be brought before the shareholders for their consideration, A dividend was declared at the rate of 4A per cent. per amnum upon the company's consolidated stock for the half-year ending the 31st of December last.
TAFF VALE.
At the half-yearly meeting of this company, held at Bristol, a dividend at the rate of S per cent. per annum was declared. free of income-tax, on. the ordinary stock-, payable on the 6th March. It was stated that various sums, amounting to 8,8001., had been paid out of revenue which, under ordinary circumstances, would have been defrayed out of capital, leaving 4,0001. to meet contingencies. The remuneration of the directors was raised from 1,2001. to 1,8001. per annum, and the company had applied for powers to raise 550,0001., of which the sum of 350,0001. was for new works, and 200,0001. for rolling stock and for alterations in the existing lines to accommodate the traffic. The revenue account showed that 115,0951. lIad been received, and 63,7461. expended, leaving a balance of ,51,3481
WORCESTER AND HEREFORD.
The report of the directors adontedatthe meetingon Friday stated that progress had been made in completing the land purchases previously arranged, and that the works of the line near Malvers, have been recommenced. The protracted pressure on the money-market explained the limited extent of the, operations undertaken during the past halfyear. The directors had entered into arrangements with Captain Penrice, R.E., for the use of his patent tunnelling machine, by which it was espected the cost of the tunnels would 'e much economized beth as to money and time. The drifts were wel opened, and as soon as the patentee was enabled to deliver the machine the tunnel work would
be rapidly pressed on. These being the lieaviest, and consequently tle governing works, it was intended to concentiate labour mainly at these points during the next three months, by which time it was hoped that the state of the money-market wrould admit of active operations over the entire length of the line. The accounts show that the receipts amsounted to 112,0401., and the payments to 109,0121., leaving a balance of 3,0281.

The Maine Law Controversy.
THE MAINE LA w CONTRO YESYy
DISTURBAJRB iT DT-WTRP-Yr
Towards the close of last week the town of Edinburgh was the scene of considerable disttirbance axd excitement, arising out of some lectures on drunkenness, teetotalism, and suppression, that had awakened public interest. The peace was first broken by the students of the University, who rose up to revenge what they considered an insult on one of their professors, their evil example being subsequently flloowed by a prosmiscuous and disorderly rabble.
The affair arose out of two lectures delivered by Professor Laycock to the members of the Edinburgh Total Abstinence Society, on the 26th and 2fi'9th of January, on the "Physiology of Drunkenness-its causes and remedies." The learned professor, who has but recently been called to fill the chair of the practice of physic in Edinburgh University, bad been invited by the society to lecture to them, it being known to them that he had made the subject one of special study, both in its nhv siological and social bearings. Inihis first lecture the P?rofes. sor indicated decided anti-suppression views, which were scarcely palatable to the menbers of the society, nearly all of whom had supported the Forbes Mackenzie Act, and many of them being ready to go for the Maine Law. Accordingly, in taking the chair at the second lecture, Mr. Duncan M'Laren, a zealous defender, as is well known, of the Mackenzie Act, entered a cateat, to the effect that Dr. Laycock had been invited not to advocate the views of the Society, but to express his own free and unfettered opinons the object being that the whole question might be fuUl
ventilated and discussed. The second lecturo being on the question. of remedv, the doctor expressed in a still stronger manner his preference of moral suasion to legal coercion, and enlarged at great length on the evils of espionage, falsehood, perjury, evasion, smuggling, &c., necessarily arising from t e system of suppression. The uso of alcoholic drinks had, he said, existed in every age and nation, and it was therefore hopeless to think of suppressing the desire by legal force. The evils to be apprehended from the Maine Law had, he considered, already partially resulted from the Mackenzie Act. Sinct that Act came intoloperation in Edinburgh perjury and prevarication had, he believed, increased fivefold. This, he said, happened one day of the week; would it be wiso to have it going on every day ? And yet this is what a Maine Liquor l,aw wouldinflict upon us, but in a degree tenfold more intensely than a Sunday Act. There is no hope, he added, that a Maine Liquor Lawv will ever be enacted in this country, or, if enacted, be continued in force for three month,s.
These spirited observations were hooted by one portion of the audience and as loudly applauded by the other. Tbev seemed even to take those on the platform by surprise, although they mutely heard them out. After the leeture Mr. M 'Laren made a speech, and commented on the remarks of Dr. Laycock as if they had reflected on the Edinburgh police, and several times used the phrase, " If Dr. Laycock had inquired he would have found" so and so. Dr. Laycock then indignantly repudiated the idea of having meant any imputation on the Edinburgh police. He acknowledged the excellence of that force, but said he had spoken of a system, not of men. As to his not having inquired, it was because he
he had taken the trouble of delivering these l eRev. A. alace then moved a vote of thanks to the lecturer, ungraciously adding that he had no doubt, when Dr. Layeocknad applied his mind further to the subect, he would be ready to ' go the whole hog" with them. S everal other speakers rose and condemned the lecturer's views, and he finding the place getting hotter and hotter abruptly made his escape. Thanks were voted to the chairman by a gentleman who seriously dissented from the doctor's views, and the meeting separated amid clamorous demonstrations on both sides.
On the Oth of February a lecture was delivered, in reply to Dr. Laycook, by Dr. Lees, of the United Kingdom Aliance, and a second answer was announced to.be delivered, on Monday evening last, under the auspices of the Edinburgh BoardfortheSuppression of theLiquorTraffic. The placards were headed, "' Dr. Laycock Dissected," and set forth that under the presidency of Mr. John Hope (a philanthropic gentleman, of somewhat extreme opinions on public quzestions), Dr. M'Culoch, of Dunmfries, would answer Dr. Laycock, and triumphantly vindicate the Maine Law. A counter-placard was issued by the students, inviting all their body to attend the meeting to "dissect Dr. M 'CnoUoch" and revenge the insult on their Professor. When the evening arrived it was found that the hall was completely packed by the students. A most tumultuous, uproarious, and amusing scene ensued. The chairman, lecturer, and members of the board entered amid tremendous hooting, and the uproar was continued without cessation, a bel being rung to stimulate it whenever any symptom of abatement was shown. The chairman essayed often, but in vain, to address the meeting. Shouts of derision, choruses of triumph, and peals of laughter answered every attempt, and the would-be speaker sat down in dismay. Various persons in the haU tried to intercede, and even an elderly lady stood up on her seat, and was seen, but not heard, to expostulate. As a crowning piece of ridicule a bottle and a glass were produced in the front galery, and convivial nods of " Here's to you" tantalzed the sober gentlemen on the platform. 3fr. Edwards, demonstrator of anatomy, tried to queU the hubbub, but in vain. He besought them to hear Dr. M''COUoch, but the only answer was, " Take out your scalpel and dissect him." The proposed lecturer then handed a note to the reporters that he " positively declined" to deliver his address that evening, and followed up his superflnous resolution by taking his departure. The chairman and committee, however, sat half an hour longer, in all an hour and a-half, the " mirth and fun" stiU running " fast and furious." At 10 o'clock he left the chair, and the meeting dispersed. The students then marshalled outside and proceeded to Dr. Laycock's house, their noisy enthusiasm bringing the doctor to the balcony, and eliciting words of thanks for their sympathyandpacific counseL They then returned tothe University, and concluded their demonstration by the wellknown strain -
"We'i tak' a cup o' kindness yet "For the sake o' auld langsyne."
Thus far, probably, the students proceedings were leniently, if not favourably, viewed by the comnunity; but their next step was more questionable. Articles appeared in some of the newspapers censuring their conduit. These prints immediately became obnoxious to their wrath, They had put down the liberty of speech; they must now put down the liberty of the press. Accordingly, written placards invited the students to meet on Thursday evening in the Quadraugle of the University, and all of them were requested to purchase copies of the Witness and Dajily Bxpress to mnake a bonfire of them. The circulation of these journals was accordingly stimulated for the moment, particularly that of the latter penny paper, but when the students came to fulfil their purpose they found the college gates had been closed by order of the magistrates. after a noisy demwonstration outside the gates they resolved to march to the Calton-hil, on the topof which they committed to the flames the presum ptuous prints. They then marched down the bil, along Princes'street, up the Mound, and down the Eigh-street, giving three groans at the offices of each of the obnoxious news papers, and three cheers for the ofsandia, which had supported Dr. Laycock in the controversy. They then proceeded southward to tbe University, and as it was found necessary to clear the streets and disperse not only the students but the mob that followed them, the police charged on the multitude several times, and in the stita several students and others were hurt. Stones were throwrn and some windows broken before quiet and order were restored. One or two of the students were apprehended by the police, but none of them were detained.
On Friday afternoon the students were still in an excited state, and several stones were throw,n between them and mischievous lads outside, in consequence of which the shops opposite the gates all put up their shutters to save their windows. The bickering was only put a stop to by the courageous interposition of a lady, whose presence proved more efficacious in restoring order than that of the poHce. A notice was posted up, inviting the students to assemble at 2 o'clock to take the somewhat tardy, and certainly the now impertinent, step of waiting on Mr. Hope, to demand an apology for the insulting placard. They accordingly mustered in great iiumbers, but their meeting was broken up by the invitation to meet Dr. Laycock in the chymistry class room. There the learned Professor addressed them for nearly an hour on the sabject. He alluded to the placard, which he said was very imnertinent to himself, and not pertinent to the case. Though he thought the students were wrong in making such a row as they did on Monday night, after aU he was glad it had happened, for it showed that the sentiments of "right and liberty" lived in the affections of the students, and that they respected the honour of the University. He was not one of those butterfingered gentlemen who thought there was nothing worse than a riot, but he oblected to their induilging in such proceedingsas those of Thursday night, because in doing so they would draw down discredit on the University, and give a handle to slanderers. He counseled them only to re-
ress their grievances by moral force. They could obtain no redress by takingthe lawintotheirownhands. If they did, he for one was ready to serve the Lord Provost as a special constable against them. He besought them for his own sake as well as their own to stay at home that evening.
Several students endorsed this advice, one of them remarking how degrading it was for them as gentlemen to fight with ench "rapanosh " as the police. A committee was appointed to wait on Mr. Hope for an apology, and to wait on the Lord Provost to state their complaints as to the way they had been used by the police.
The students almost aU took the professor's advice, and stayed at home that night, but their disorderly spirit had aroused a demon stiUl less easily appeased. A large and mischievously disposed rabble surrounded the college, increasing in numbers as the night advanced, and between 9 and 10 numbering several thousands. The successive efforts of
thepolice to"disparse them had only momentary success, and every charge was answered by a volley of stones, which did considerable mischief to pe rson and property. About 10 o'clock the high constables appeared, and several times ordered to hae upon the crowd. After great exertions the poHce and the high constables at length succeeded in clearing the streets, but several gentlemen anlong the latter body were cut and injured by stones, and a still larger number of the police force were likewise hurt. Several persons wereapprehended for stone-throwing and other riotous conduct, and brought beforo the magistrate in the police-court on Saturday, but the case against them was continued till Monday.
On Saturday forenoon a deputation of the students waited on Mr. John Hope to request an apology, which that gentleman politely declined to give, considering that the apology was rather due to himself. A meeting was held in the afternoon, to whluich the deputation reported their want of success. ~Dr. Laycock then entered and addressed them, recommending them to allow the mnatter to end. It was, however, resolved to meet again and hear the result of the interview with the Lordl Provost. The students dispersed very peaceably about 4 o'clock, and there seemed no further likelihood of the disturbances being renewed.
