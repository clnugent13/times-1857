THE COMMEROLAL lEta. MONEY-MARKET AND CITY INTELLIGENCE. Wed-nesday Eyening. The commercial course of 1856 has realized almost precisely the anticipations entertained of it. At the commencement of the year the prospect of peace was entirely uncertain, but the public had already learnt that under a sound currency system financial derangement was not among the inevitable evils of war, and that, accordingly, whatever might be the course of politics, the trade of the country would continue to expand. The chief anxiety was with regard to the inflation that might occur should bostilities suddenly terminate. It was known that financiers and adventurers of all kinds bad passed the two years of strife in preparing a multitude of continental schemes, and that there even existed a small political party whose eagerness for peace on any terms arose from impatience to secure the profits of these proceedings. The guarantee system on the part of foreign Governments bad yet to receive its fuUl development, and the speculative mania in France, scarcely curbed by the necessities of the State, appeared destined on the slightest withdrawal of pressure to assume uncontroUable proportions. Finally, it was predicted that, while every great improvement at home worud be delayed by endless obstructions, we should mQst likely be called upon to send millions of our capital to Russia to extend her oities, reconstruct her fortifications, and furnish her with military roads. The correctness of these views has been demonstrated. Within a few months of the signing of the treaty of peace about 100 companies, chiefly for foreign purposes, with au aggregate capital of 25,000,0001., were presented, while preliminary arrangements were understood to have been completed for others that would have doubled or trebled the amount. The Russian demand for 40 millions, which is to be adroitly introduced in such proportions as the credulity of investers may from time to time render practicable, was likewise initiated, and, although the rising folly was checked by timely warnings, coupled with the consequences of the failure of the European silk crop, it still attained a magnitude that has been attended by heavy penalties. Meanwhile, however, the gains of regular commerce and the rates of interest fairly obtained by capitalists have been beyond al precedent. Looking at the extent of business transacted, there have also been fewer failures than at any former date. Even those that have occurred have been in nearly every case unconnected with real mercantile casualties, and, although the peculiar taint of the time has been such as is manifested in the instance of the Royal British Bank, and in the offences of that numerous class of gamblers of whom Sadleir, Redpath, and Robson may be regarded as types, there never was a period when the rewards of honest industry were more certain. For the year which now opens the prospect is confilicting. Notwithstanding the nominal peace of Europe political confidence is wholly wanting, while at the same time the long continuance of high rates in all the principal money-markets has disheartened every speculator. It is, however, the speculator only that is unable to see his way. The legitimate merchant and manufacturer has acquired such confidence from past exDerience that he dreads nothing but the disturbance to trade that would result fiom the spirit of gambling being again let loose. It may be questioned if the country was ever so rich as at the present moment, and it is certain that the general profits of commerce and agriculture, taking every branch of occupation into account, are beyond any former example. These profits have encouraged all classes of producers, notwithstanding the high rates of discount, to keep up at least to an ordinary average their stocks of raw material, and they are consequently safe from every contingency. It will be said, if trade is thus prosperous, the speculator cannot have long to wait before his field of operation will again be extensive. The immense transactions now going on under every circumstance of advantage must, it may be urged, result in an accumulation of gain, and a consequent plethora in our money-market will be followed by another of those periods in which the public, with a few millions to spare, wiU employ the whole in the shape of deposits upon commitments to ten times its amount. Assuming the absence of any accidents to delay the process, it must be admitted this conclusion is inevitable. While our profits are now larger and more rapid than ever, we are at the same time unusually free from any immediate drain upon them. A heavy proportion of the sums subscribed for Indian, Canadian, and United States railways before the commencement of the war has already been disbursed, and many of the principal schemes brought forward in the summer of the present year have subsequently remained in abeyance. There is, therefore, no process of depletion going on, and hence, as far as our domestic position is concerned, a renewal of war or a bad harvest-the two points to which every financial estimaLe Is made conditionalforms, apparently, the only possibility that may interfere with the anticipated expansion. But there are external conditions to exercise a disturbing influence. The high rate of money during the past few months has been caused, not by home, but by foreign competition, and there is no assurance that this will permanently diminish. The question whether the disease which destroyed the silk crop last season will reappear cannot yet be decided. Should it continue, and France sustain another loss of 3,000,0001. or 4,000,0001. sterling, a further demand for capital will be felt in that country, which will cause extreme terms to be offered for whatever we can spare. Austria likewise must continue, either by direct loans or by fresh sales of national property, to procure an additional 2,000,0001. or 3,000,0001. of gold and silver before she can venture to resume specie payments. Even if these contingencies were absent there would still be reason to expect the continental biddings for money to be incessant. It is plain that the late revulsion on the Paris Bourse haa operated not to cure, but merely to check the speculative mania. The temporary obstruction, indeed, has only intensified the greed of schemers of all ranks, and, instead of being accepted as a lesson, it has served to sharpen the clamours for such stimulants as the creation of new credit esta'olishments and an increase in the capital of the Bank of }rance. As the existing pressure was not ufficient to prevent a loan of 3,000,0001. being eagerly offered to Spain, there is little difficulty in conjecturing the move- ments to be looked for the moment that pressure shall be lightened. It will be strange if Russia fails where Spain succeeds; and although, notwithstanding the influence of English capitalists willing to identify themselves with her attempt, and the artifices which will be employed toassst it onthe London Stock-Exchange, it may be hoped our people will retain sufficient sanity to rejeet it, the seheme could not become current InParis and in theGerman cities without indirectly Increasing the applications to us for assistance. Altogether, therefore, the prospect is that the continental requirements will be maintained tzt a point too tempting to leave much cbance of a rage being got up in this country for new and independentinvestments. While the rates for carrying on transactions from month to month in French rents, ralway shares, and obligations range from 8 Io 12 per cent., there will be only very moderate amounts at the serrice of projectors on this side. Our neighbours for the first time in modem history have taken the start of us in speculation, and, consequently, in our immediate outpourings of capital we are likely to act rather as accessories than as principals. This position, perhaps, will be the least perilous, although when the final crash comes our share in it will not be insignificant. Among other points that will claim the attention of financiers during the year, although their probable bearings are less capable of being distinctly estimated, are the necessity for loans in India which vil be created by the Persian war, the solution of the Chinese dispute, the efforts that may be made by Turkey to restore her currency, and the confusion that will stiU be kept up in Europe from the constant and inevitable advance in the price of silver. We have also to anticipate, through the Atlantic tele. graph, a revolution in our mode of conducting monetary transactions with the United States. A similar achievement vid the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates is perhaps not distant in the case of India. Whether these wil tend to econoraize the use of capital in the enormous transactions between us, which involve annually a value of about 60,000,0601., is among the most interesting problems of the period. The working of the new mail contract with Australia wil be another feature of the year. As regards home discussions on commerce and finance, the prosperous revenue promised by the state of trade will probably render it difficult for the ChanceUor of the Exchequer to maintain his existing scale of taxation, notwithstanding the reductions about to come into opera. tion on tea, sugar, and coffee. Upon the Currency Act of 1844 no serious conflict need be apprehended. Eighteen hundred and fifty-seven commences, consequently, with numerous signs that it wil be a year of animation, but without any extraordinary change being in view to prompt a strong anticipation of the circumstances by which it wil be most distinguished. It is commonly at such periods that events of the greatest singularity occur. If, however, the twelve months should in a commercial sense bring forth no strange result of a positive description, they will at least, supposing them to pass over without any access of wild inflation, be remarkable for a negative one, since it wiU be the first time in the present generation that a lapse of more than ten years has occurred without symptoms being discernible of the approach of a new reign of recklessness and delusion. The English funds have been very firm to-day, and have closed at an advance. Consols opened at the final price of last evening, 94 to * ex. dividend; but there were soon buyers at 94J, and the last official quotation was 94i to J. After regular hours, in consequence of a statement that the revenue accounts to be published to-morrow will sbow an increase of 800,0001. on the quarter, and 4,000,0001. on the year, transactions took place at a further improvement of an eighth. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94i tot; New Three per Cents., 9 to i; Exchequer-bond, 98i to i; and India Bonds, and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium. Foreign securities also have generally exhibited firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 95, 951, and J, and for the account at 95£ and J; the Small, 95g. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions were at 1.03j for the account; Brazilian Small, 100k; Granada New Active, 211; Mexican, for the account, 211 and J; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45i and J ; Russian, 1071; Sardinian, 89i; Spanish Three per Cents., 41ki; Spanish Certificates, 5 and I; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97 and 97. The demand for money to-day was stil extremely heavy at full rates. The corn-market this morning was without alteration. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was again 66f. 55c. for money and account. A further sum of 64,0001. of the gold by the Red Jacket was taken to the Bank to-day. About 100,0001. was expected, but there was an increase in the demand for the continent. The failure was announced to-day of the mercantile house of Mr. G. B. Rocca. The liabilities are believed to amount at least to 50,0001., and the event is attributed to the suspension, advised yesterday, of the house of Decio Trasciatti, of Trieste, in connexion with which Mr. Rocma is said to be under commitments to the extent of 30,0001. The prospectus has been issued of the Oude Railway Company, with a capital of 1,000,0001. in 201. share". The entire length of lines contemplated is 450 miles, but the company propose to commence with a section of about 50 miles from Cawnpore to Lucknow. The fertility of the province is unquestioned, ancd an application Is in progress for a guarantee from the fndia-house, without which it is properly stated the project will not be proceeded with. The Swiss Government have notified their intention to raise a federal loan of 480,0001. in virtue of the authority recently granted, and which was to the extent of 1,200,0001. Of this 480,0001. the portion to be subscribed in Switzerland is 100,0001. The remainder is to be raised abroad. The bonds are to be of 201., 401., and 2001., and they are to bear 5 per cent. interest., to be issued at par, and to be redeemable in 20 years by a sinking fund with annual drawings. At the Court of Bankruptey to-day a petition was ifiled for adudieation of bankruptcy against Mr. Humphrey Brown, hI.P. The petitioning creditors are the assignees of the Royal B3ritish Bank, of whieh Mr. Brown was a director. The alleged debt, as unsecured, is nearly 40,0001. Messrs. Linklater and Hackwood are the solicitors for the petition, which has been balloted to Mr. Commissioner Evans. The Valetta steamer with the East India and Ohina mails arrived at MarseiUes yesterday at 1 p.m. The mails left for London at 10 p.m., and are expected to be delivered to-morrow afternoon or on Friday morning.
TRADE REPORT. Wednesday Even'ng. TALLOW.-The market has been quiet to-day, 58s. being paid both for this month to settle contracts and for January to March; some trifles have been done a shade under, but at the close there was less disposition to sell.

RAILWA Y AND MINING SHBS. Wednesday Evenlng. Although the rise in the railway-market was unimportant there was a general tendency to further improvement. Most descriptions exhibited increased firmness, including East Indian and foreign. Numerous transactions took place in Grand Trunk of Canada. The shares are now converted into stock, and the price of 56 to 58 is equal to 19A per share of 251. The debentures were also largely dealt in at 82 to 83. In joint-stock bank or miscellaneous securitiws the fluctuations were not extensive. Transactions took place in Canada Land at 131, 130, and 131, and the final quotation was 130 to 135.

LONDON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 1, 1857. The New Year that begins to-day brings with it expectations far more fixed and duties far better defined than those which ushered in its predecessor just expired. Then we were neither at war nor at peace, halting between two opinions, and divided between our anxiety to put an end to a cruiel and dlevastating struggle, and our wish to show more conspicuously than our Generals and Admirals had allowed us to do the stuff and manhood that we felt were in us. Any idea of substantial improvement at home had given way to the preoccupations of war; war in its turn had lost its earnestness through the suggestions of a probable peace; and peace itself was extremely uncertain and only half acceptable. Now everything is altered. True, we have exchanged one war for two; but these conflicts are too remote and too trivial to cause any serious anxiety or to distract public attention from that on which it ought to be fixed-makina up as far as we can for lost time, and placing ourselves as 1 near as we can in the position which we should i liave occupied had the peace of the world never been interrupted. Oni this day every one ought " to take stock" for himself, for what he has done and what remains to do; to consider how much of his aspirations has been visionary and how much sound and attainable; and to draw out for himself a programme of what ought to be accomplished before the close of the present year. As to foreign policy, we are, we believe, on the point of receivi-ng full satisfaction for the evasion of the treaty attempted by Russia; we have good hopes of amicably arranginig the dispute between Prussia and Neuchatel; and we make no doubt that if Governor-General YEU is as yet deaf to our remonstrances a recurrence to the same line of argument as that we have recently employed will bring conviction surely, if tardily. There remains Persia. All our past experience is in favour of her immediate subniission; but, considering how difficult she is to reach, how worthless as a conquest, how little useful as an ally, an1 how little formidable as an enemy, we have every motive to shorten the period of this ignoble quarrel. To preserve our intimate alliance with France, our good understanding with the United States, oiur identity of sentiment with Auzliria on Eastern questions, and to maintain the attitude of protest which we have taken up against the existWg Govermnent of Naples, are all obvious maxims of foreign policy. With our colonies we have nothinig to do but to leave them to the silent course of growth| and expansion, which interference from us mniglht impede, but cannot possibly accelerate. What, then, remains for us to do at home? Two questions claim precedence of all othezs, partly from their extreme importance, partly from the degree in which they occupy and excite the public mind. The first, as will be anticipated, is the feeling of insecurity of life and propety now unhappily so prevalent in every part of the kingdom. The form in which this feeling expresses itself is an outcry against the system of granting tickets of leave. The substantial evil is, as we apprehend, the almost entire cessation of the practice of transportation. It is but little comfort to the victims of fraud or violence to tell them that the person from whom they receive the injury has expiated his former offence by undergoing the penalty annexed to it. Whatt he public really requires is entire security for life and property, not security against a particular class of depredators. The question will be very imperfectly met by abolishing tickets of leave. What is absolutely required is nothing lets than a complete review of the system of secondary punishments, with a plan by wfiih persons convicted of any serious crime shall be removed from the country, never again to return to it. Besides this question Parliament is, as we learn, to be asked once more to consider the abolition of the Ecclesiastical Courts-a problem presenting no difficulty which may not easily be solved, and the further postponement of which wiU entail very serious discredit on Parliament. Then there is the question of the transfer of land, a plan for simplifying which, we are told on the authority of the ATToh?NET-G-xmRun, is completely matured. The Encumbered Estates Court has familiaiized us ivtth the immense beriefits to be derived from a 2masi-judicial investigation of title and a Parliamentary guarantee for its completeness, and we shall have good reason to complain if such a benefit be longer withheld from the landowners of this country. Then there is the Corporation of London, an abuse which has survived by one generation the demise of institutions of a similar rature all over the country. We trust that Sir GEonosE Gny will reintroduce his bill on the subject, but that it winl not be disgraced,likeits predecessor, by anyfutile attempts to continue the present division between the civic and metropolitan police, and that the rascality of London wil not be allowed, in deference to interested clamour, the impunity afforded by a divided command. The whole question of duties on shipping, passing tolls, charities, duties levied by corporations for their own use, and differential dues, stiU remains unsettled, and we hope the session will not pass over without an instalment of that justice which the shipping interest has a right to expect in these matters. The question of the renewal of the Bank Charter, involving, as it does, the twofold consideraticn-the maintenance in all its integrity of our present standard of value, and the remuneration received by the Bank of England for performing duties which the Government could very well perform for itself-will also claim attention, and the session ought not to pass by without carrying out the principle of 1844 much further than has been done by the mere separation of the banking and issuing departments. Besides this, there is the question of joint-stock banks, which are now subjected to a law peculiarly inconvenient and expensive, and to a process of winding-up which does not even determine the jurisdiction which is to accomplish it, and involves a ruinous expenditture in law for the purpose of ascertaining questions which ought not to be left for a moment in doubt. Here is occupation for a busy and useful session. We have said notbing of Ifaynooth and the other stock topics of professional agitators, because we do not rank them among measures in which the community at large can be said to be interested. When we come to review the proceedings of Parliament at the close of its labours it will be seen whether we have calculated too boldly on the efficiency and industry of our Legislature.
The time-honoured phrase of "poor old Ire" land" may be considered as representing something which has now ceased to exist. On this 1st of January, at the commencement of a new year, we may venture to predict that " rich young " Ireland!' will soon become the mnore appropriate denomination. On all sides we hear of increasing agriculture, decreasing poorrrates, cessation of political agitation, good feeling between landlord and tenant, and other unmistakeable evidence of rising prosperity. The Irish peasant is no longer the worst fed, worst housed, worst clad pariah in Europe. The potato is no more the staple of his bill of fare, and a drunken brawl the limit of his desires, when his desires are pointed at luxury and diversion. The cabin of our friend PAT is no longer a singular construction of clay supported by the side of a ditch. His frieze coat is no longer a miracle of holes and patches; his breeches are for the most part leg-worthy, and his shoes will not uncommonly keep out the water. The most astounding proof we have yet seen of the improved condition of the Irish peasant is, that the pig, or " slip," the object of his former solicitude, the soother of his toils, the companion of his labours, the sharer of his joys, the darling of his ohildren, has, even in Connaught, been banished from the family mansion, and may now be seen in occupation of an architectural edifice, or sty, entirely devoted to its own use. Tne results of this social revolution are already to be traced in the criminal calendars of the country. It is not that dreadful crimes are not still occasionaLly committed in Ireland; it is not even that traces of those crines for wlhich Ireland was not long since unfortunately notorious are not still to be met with in the records of the assizes; but the population of three provinces no longer continues in organized opposition to thelaw. In Ireland, as in all othercountries, we shouldstill expect to meet with isolated instances of murder, burglary, arson, forgery, and so forth, and with scattered cases of agrarian assassination, for the bloody mind of former days has not yet been purged of all its foulness; but the people of Ireland are no longer an exceptional people; Irish crime is no longer the wonder and the despair of the criminal pathologist. Time was when extraordinary remedies were necessary for the extraordinary disease. The usual machinery of the police which was found effective in civilized countries completely broke down when tried in Ireland. Measure after measure was taken, and in vain. At last it was determined that the police-if that term be indeed applicable to the well drilled, well armed, well disciplined Irish police-shovild take, as it were, nilitary possession of tIre country. The Irish constable was not a policeman, nor was he quite a soldier, but something betveen the two, and far more effective than either for the peculiar services which were claimed at his hands. The Irish constabulary force of those days, and in those days, was admirably adapted to check, if it could not eradicate, the crime which was one of the characteristic features of Ireland in those dismal times. Now the times have altered, and so has the character of the constabulary force. The first point we will pass over, as too obvious to need illustration. With regard to the Irish constable himself, he was ever a mixture of the policamani and the soldier, with a general tendency to sink the policeman in the soldier. No words of ours ^an do justice to the efficiency and vigour of this mest useful body of men tbrough a long course of years. l3ut for their intelligence, their exertions, their fortitude, their courage, bad as the state of things in Irelancd actually was, it would have been a thousandfold worse. They held the country in a network of lines, intersecting stationsw hich might be seen thickly marked upon any police chart of the country. They made it their business to become acquainted with the natural features of the country, with the fastnesses of the law-breakers, vwith the character of the inhabitants in their peculiar districts,-with every circuinstance, in short, which could assist them in the prevention of crime, or lead thenm to its detection, if unihappily the time for prevention had gone by. Those who remnember the state of Ireland as it was some 15 or 20 years ago must have often listened to the stories which these men could tell over the glowing embers of their peat fires; how, " from information they had " received," they knew that this or that man had been marked for death in the secret councils of the Ribandmen; how, from " further infornation," they were aware that the emissary of death was on his way from some distant county to execute the doom ; how they found out the cabin in which he was to seek shelter; how they traced him to the spot, and set their snare; how they were baffled in their attempt to seize the Irish Thug alive, and with the ring of a police carbine his fate was sealed. Nor were there wanting tales of ambuscades of greater mark, and of conflicts with the lawless peasantry on a higher scale. The consequence of all tlhis was, thatthe military element in this remarkable force becamne every day more and more developed. Theiv leadets took a pride in them ; they took a: pride in themselvesj their accoutrements, their. arms, and in the high character of the corps to which they belonged. Therce were not wanting many competent judges who asserted, and who assert still, that with a brief training to enable them to act in rnasses the Irish constabulary would constitute the most effiIcient Division in the service of the British CBowN. The men are most carefully selected from the most intelligent among the orderly population ; they are trained to act singly and tegether, to taL-e the orders of their chiefs, and to obey them implicitly; but yet, in emergency, to rely upon themselves. Every day, as the necessity for their peculiar action has diminished, the tendency of the Irish constabulary to grow into a purely military force has increased. They are now soldiers, and very splendid soldiers too-not police. It seems a pity that we cannot avail ourselves of the services of these men in the manner in which they would prove of most advantage to the country. This, of cotuse, must depend upon their own wishes, for they have enrolled themselves as constables for local service; they have not enlisted as soldiers for the general defence of the empire. If, however, this result be c'imerlical, then we are driven, not without much r.3gret, to the conclusion that it would be for the pablic benefit if they were systematically deprived of zomething of that military organization wxhich has hitherto rendered them so remarkable for efficiency and discipline. Quiet as Ireland now is, and still more quiet as it seems probable she will be, a few regimaents must be kept in that division of the empire, as in England or in Scotland. If the public trainquillity be seriously threatened there will be the force forthcoming to maintain it. The electric telegraph will soon summon fresh reinforcements, and the locomotive and steamship bear them to the spot at an average speed of 20 miles an hour. The public tranquillity, then, is provided for, as far as serious outbreaks are concerned. In Ireland, however, as elsewhere, there is need of the more modest thieftaker to bring ordinary criminals to justice. The Irish constabalary, which is still a body admirably adapted for carrying on a guerilla warfare against a peasantry ever on the eve of insurrection, and against the secret conclaves of Ribandmen, is not so efficient as a machine for the detection of ordinary crime, and for bringing ordinary criminals to the bar of a criminal court. In the transactions which have grown out of the murder of Mr. IITTLE an illustra-tion of this position may be found. Seven weeks have now elapsed since the perpetration of that foul deed, and the proceedings of the police appear to have been of the most puerile and nugatory character. We qan scarcely credit a statement which has been forwarded to us from Ireland to the effect, that when other means of detection failed the police authorities at Dublin actually called in the aid of the fooleries of magnetism; but so Iuns the tale. Granting, even, that the persons charged with the investigation attached no credit themselves to this miserable hocuspocus, and that they only employed it for the purpose of inspiring terror in the culprit and arousing his apprehensions, if he should yet be on the spot; yet what a resource was this! Iff their suspicion, rested upon any golid basis they had no need of magnetism; if they were purely of a speculative character, then it was a most heinous thing to expose a considerable body of men collectively to the indigna'vion of their countrymen, simplybecause it was imagined that among them the real culprit might possibly be found. Surely this is not the country nor is this the age for the tricks of the Obi-man, nor for the " rice dodge " of the Hindoo. If this be the best -weapon of detection in the arsenal of the Ilish Police, the sooner some more regular practitioners are despatched to the Irish capital the better it will fare with the lives and the property of its inhabitants. In short, let the Irish Constabulary henceforth be really considered what they are-remarkably fine troops,; and let us provide a suitable police force for Ireland as she is; or let us require the constabulary to resign a character which the exigencies of the country no longer require them to retain, and to become dptectives and thieftakers in the ordinary acceptation of those unsavoury terms.
Dr. LIVINGSTON;, as the letter we published on Monday proves, is anxious, as a traveller and a discoverer ought to be, that we should know the value of the new lands he has added to geography, and understand the results of a jolurney across the continent of Africa, from Loando oni the west coast to Quilimane on the east. The journey is not one from which beforehand we expect much profitable discovery. We are ready generally to hand over Central Africa to science as her proper field and possession. But Dr. LIvIXeGSTON assures us that he has brought home more than cold facts and bare knowledge; he opens out the treasures of Central Africa to our view, and excites our commercial cupidity and adventure. This region, hitherto put aside as a desert, is announced to contain the material of profitable speculation, and to exhibit t,he bounty anid the charms of nature. The traveller, when he has descended below 20 degrees of latitude, finds himself in such " well-watered" lands that " it is impossible, at onie season of the year, even to have a waggon-path," and in regions of almost Elysian salubrity, " where the smallpox " and measles have not been known for 20 years, " and consumption, scrofuLla, cancer, and hydro"phobia have been scarcely heard of." The European invalid who has tried all systems of medicine and all climates has still some hope left, then, in the sanitaxia of Central Africa, wvhich nature herself seems to protect from the dominion of disease. :He -will find himself, indeed, amonig rough nurses, and wvithout some of those luxuries and conveniences on which invalids depend, and the journey will not be without its trials ; but the kindnless of nature will compensate for all these losses, and he will drink the eliri, rihee of a new hcaltb-breathing atmosphere. But the new commercial prospect is the most striking, and a new cotton trade, a new coal trade, and a new coffee trade open upon us. Central Africa is admirably adapted, accorcling to Dr. Livxxesrox, in point of climate and soil, to grow cotton, vhile we know that at the Cape of Good Hope native labour is to be had for 7s. 6d. a month. Here, then, is a new triumph open to commerce and philanthropy if they will take advantage of th.e opportunity here is a rival to the American' "South," a new cottoni countr-y vithout slave :iabour. Could such a dream be realized, what towns and cities, railroads and harbours, rise before us,-new Charlestowns, new Savannahs, newv Now Orleanses. What new names of cities, towns, and villages we shall have on the map, when the Bechuanas, the Belundas, and the Bakalahari, under their MATrrAvos, CA=zEmos, and MoxomroTAPAS, are constituted into settled industrial populations, that work all the week and g6 to church or meeting-house on the Sunda,ys; for the missionary societies are promised almost as rich a field of conquest as our men of trade,-at least if they I wvill adopt the recommendation of the African chieftains themselves, wiho profess themselves quite ready, if required, *to "beat their tribes" into the Christian belief, and even strongly solicited the missionary's permission to do so. These 'simplemfinded lpotentates,, the modern representatives of the - Saxon E:rssrnrnT, the Frank Otovvs. and the itussian VfApiMin, have not yet arrived at the full idea of lib5eitjy of nscn i2nce; they recommend the same wholesale scale of conversion which told with such effect upon our ancestors, and quieted the scruples and doubts of Dr. LjSriNoMN by the assurance, " Oh, you " do not know them so well as we do; we " are sure we could beat them into belief if " we tried." Even the plebeian African mind has shown the ardour of piety so far as to admit that a missionary " is not a thing to be killed"a confession which refutes the illiberal prophecy of SYDr-ny S:aTn, and is an encouragement-at any rate negatively and as removing 3 considerable damper-to missionary exertion. Our new converts, however, would probably be rather aueer Christians for some time; a religion beaten into them would find a receptacle hardly preparea for it, and the chieftains themselves would be apt to rebel and apostatize when they found themselves forbidden any longer to sell their subjects for slaves-a practice in which they indulge, though the stoppage of the slave trade has lowered the price of the articles from 201. to 12s., " an evidence," says Dr. LIvr1GSTO, "1 that "our slave trade measures have not been wholly "ineffective." But cotton is not our only commercial prospect; a new coal trade is promised:-" There would be no "great difficulty in a small armed steamer going up "the Zambese 300 miles to the parts around Tete, "where the seams crop out of the surface." These seams are 48 and 5S inches in thickness, they incline upwards so as to supersede the expense of drainage, and they are easily approached by flat-bottomed boats, which go up a tributary of the Zambese to within two or three miles of the place. As for coffee, by the assistance of the Jesuits and the birds, a good deal is done to our hands; the seed planted by the Itoman missionary has been propagated, it is said, by birds over the whole country, and merchants we are told are now seriously turning their attention to the culture of that plant. We omit the nminor articles of trade,-the beeswa-x which abounds, and is thrown away by the natives, who only use the honey ; the abundance " of specular iron and the black oxide;" the grapes, which are not, however, good, though the country is in some parts covered with wild vines; the wheat which grows on the parts fiooded by the Zambess, that inundates large patches of country annually like the Nile. Whether these dreams of commerce, philanthropy, and faith will ever be realizecl is of course more than we can say, for such a subject as the resources of a country requires more than the testimony of one man, however diligent and discriminating an inquirer, in order to be decided satisfactorily. The " greedy sailor," 'whom classical poetry reprobates, does not in these days immediately set out in his bark for a new country as soon as discovered, and snatch at a bargain; commerce is now a larger, more systematic, and more solid affair. But Dr. I' SrOT has undoubtedly done an important service, his unwearied search as a traveller has enabled him to point out apparently promising sources of mercantile improvement and expansion, vhich it will be the duty of the conductors of commerce now to esamine ; and, whatever may be the issue of such an inquiry, science has at any rate gained new data from Dr. LrviNrsTox's travels, and spirited adventure the encouragement of a bright example.

BIsHorrIc oF Rrroi.-The Dean and Chapter of the cathedral church of Ripon held a special chapter on Tuesday morning, the 30th ult., for the purpose of electing tle Rev. Robert Biekersteth, D.D., to be bishop and pastor of the see. It is needless to add that Dr. Bickersteth was unanimously elected. The dean and canons proceeded from the Chapter-house to the choir, whence the Hon. and Very Rev. Henry David Erskine, D.D., the dean, advanced to the west door of the choir, and turning towards the nave published and declered such election to the cleroy and people in his own name and that of the canons. The confirmation is to take place in York Minster after morning prayers on Saturday, the 17th inst., and the consecration at the parish church of Bishopsthorpe, near York (adjoining the Palace of the Archbishop of York), on the following day. ArroiNtMEXT OF A ogFlnB CONsTAB3 FOR LTNCOLNSHRE.-The committee of magistrates appointed to receive and examine the testimonials of gentlemen seeking the office of chief constable of the new rral police force now being organized in Lincolnshire recently held a meeting, at which, out of a list of 102 ocdidates, the names of blajor Chester, Major 31'Kinistry, and Captain Bicknell were selected for further consideration. At the next meeting of the committee Captain Bickncll was lected, he havig a majorityof one vote over Major Chester. The newly-appointed officer will this day (Thursday) commence his organization of the sebsi&iary departmzents of the force. fHovt YoVNG M - nEconE DlssrxoNsTr.-We have frequently called attention to the fact that many large houses pay their young mien shamefully low salaries; but we really did not believe that young men intrusted with mnoney responsibilities to the extent of 17,000C. in little over a-year were paid as little as 12s. or 13s. a-week. Yet, at the AssieCourt on Tuesday last it wasproven that such were the wages paid to a young man named Alexander Smith by one of our wealthiest iron frms. One is almost vexed that the masters instead of the men cannot be placed at the bar in such cases. The master, on being examiined, " really did not know what wages the young man hhd." This is the more wonderful as most men, on hearing that any one of their servants had been peculating would have asked first of all what wages he had The lad, it seems, received sore S0I a-yesr, and helped himself to some 701. more, which raised his income to 1001. Now, we should think that sum little indeed for one passing 17,0001. through his fingers. This cawe appears to us the more gross because the employer was known to be as good as his fellowv-oflicias at raising the salaries of persons paid by the city, and not ot of his own pocket. ' hat a queer world this is! A clerk in the public service is allowed 200f. or even SOOt. by men that pay their own clerks one-tenth of the sum. We really hope some stepswill be taken by the Legislature to make masters know what salaries their cerks have, and aso whether these are in proportion to their services and responsibilities. It is high time to arouse extensive employers from that blissful state of ignorance which allows the young men they select incividually to be starved with 13s. a-week! It is to be regretted that men who have a haud in saddling the city with grand schemes which cost hundreds of thousands are not a little more magrnificeat in the way of paving their own servants, Counsel for the prisoner and the judge Nvere sure that, had the head of the firm knowr. the wages of the young mam, things had been different. Some say, however, that if he did not know he ought to have known. Charity begins at home, and thgse avho do not know about their own affairs should not oier their sernices to the prblic. It is to be feared that not a few, very zealous to flourish as magistrates and councilors, know precious little about their own affairs. Those who know not how to role their own affairs were forbidden by the highest authority to intrude themselves into themanagemeut of others' affairs, and it would be vell that none served the nublic but those who can do so without infringing on their own business.-Glajosw Exnminier. ALLEGED ABDUCTION AT B13H.-In The Tivies of Tuesday some particulars aupearedof an action to recover damages for the alleged aobduction of a French governess, Madanioiselle Louise Koeh. The action was brought by the Rev. J. Bescombe against Mr. Rocho and his mother-in-law, Mrm. Madox. The hearing of the case was resumed yesterday at Bath, when soine further evidance was given in support of the case. Mr. T. W. Saunders then addressed the jury for the defendants, and called Mr. Becbe, who made a general denial of the statements of the witnesssfor the plaintiff. The defendant became much excited towards the close of his examination, and charaoterized several of the statements nmade by the plaintiff and his witnesses as :' infernal lies.' When crossexamined he gave a direct negative to all questions put to him. Theferther hearing of the case was adjourned till Friday.

It is to be regretted that men who have a haud in saddling the city with grand schemes which cost hundreds of thousands are not a little more magrnificeat in the way of paving their own servants, Counsel for the prisoner and the judge Nvere sure that, had the head of the firm knowr. the wages of the young mam, things had been different. Some say, however, that if he did not know he ought to have known. Charity begins at home, and thgse avho do not know about their own affairs should not oier their sernices to the prblic. It is to be feared that not a few, very zealous to flourish as magistrates and councilors, know precious little about their own affairs. Those who know not how to role their own affairs were forbidden by the highest authority to intrude themselves into themanagemeut of others' affairs, and it would be vell that none served the nublic but those who can do so without infringing on their own business.-Glajosw Exnminier. ALLEGED ABDUCTION AT B13H.-In The Tivies of Tuesday some particulars aupearedof an action to recover damages for the alleged aobduction of a French governess, Madanioiselle Louise Koeh. The action was brought by the Rev. J. Bescombe against Mr. Rocho and his mother-in-law, Mrm. Madox. The hearing of the case was resumed yesterday at Bath, when soine further evidance was given in support of the case. Mr. T. W. Saunders then addressed the jury for the defendants, and called Mr. Becbe, who made a general denial of the statements of the witnesssfor the plaintiff. The defendant became much excited towards the close of his examination, and charaoterized several of the statements nmade by the plaintiff and his witnesses as :' infernal lies.' When crossexamined he gave a direct negative to all questions put to him. Theferther hearing of the case was adjourned till Friday.

T1n PxoPrnT AsnY INcomE TAx.-The Batt Town Council held a special meeting on Tuesday to con sider the propriety of petitioning Parliament for the re duction and readjustment of this tax. Mr. P. Cook, thi mayor, presided, and there was a large attendance of thi council. Some of the speakers advocated the principle of thi property and income tax, but all agreed that, as at presen, levied, it was unequal and unjust. Mr. Alderman Hunt, ii an eloquent speech, moved the following resolution, whicl was ably seconded by Mr. Jolly, and carried unanimously - "-That while tkis counil fully admit the necessity of raising th. Dropertr and income t,x froma d. to 16d. in the pound *or the purpos Of neetzng the exigencies of the vrar in wvhich this country has bee, engaged foe tbe liberties of Europe. tI es coraider that, the w-as hem; a-ow DSapsfCi concluded, such portion of the ab ve tx as was levies for the purpOse of caring it On shouid be f. rthwrith abandoned, anw thatapetitionbe presentedto the Jiouse of Comunons prasiug une) seduction; and that such portion of hebtax as ucy be retained hsha undoergo rec' Uion. w, ith t.hr v iew to a mure eaqu itable distribution of i amsong the various classes of taxpayers." . petition in accordauce vith this resolution was agreed to and the city seal affixed to it. It was also resolved to semn it to Captain Scobell for presentation, and to request Mr Tite and the members for the county to support its prayer. TiE lTcomR Tix. -A special meetbsg of the town-council of Bath was held on Taesday to oppose the income-tax. The sabject was introduced by Mr. Alderman Hunt, who denounced the tax as oppressive and unjust, and moved,-" That while this councl ful3 admits the necessity there was for raising the property and income tax during the late war witb Russia from 7d. in the pound to ls. 4d., they consider that, this war being nov. happily concduded, such part of the above tax as was levied for the purpose of carrying it on should be forthwith aban. doned, and that, a petition be presented to the House of Commons praying for such reduction; and also that sucb portion of the tax as may be retained shall undergo a revaaon, eith the view to a more equitable distribution of it among ibe various classes of ratepayers." The resolution, which was seconded by Mr. Jolly, was unanimously agreed to and a petition founded upon it was adopted, which is to be intrasted to the city members (Captain Scobell and Mr. Tite) for presentation, and the members of the eastern division of the county (2Messrs. W. Miles and Knatchbull) are to be requested to support its rayer. A depatation from the Society for Promiaoing the Interests of the Trading Community has been in Bristol and Clifton during the week, soliciting signatures to a petition for the repeal or modification of the tax. THE So sEIRsmnESB 31urrns.-The exertions of the pllice engaged in searching the fields in the neighbourbood wheretheimurderof Aplin tookplacehave beenrews-arded bythe discovery of the canvass bag, or purse, in which the doceased carried the five sovereigns, counted by him in the presence of the accused (Thomas Nation), before they left Wiveliscombe on the night in question. The prisoner was conveyed back to the county gaol at Taunton about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, where he exhibits considerable indifference on the subject of the crime with which he stands charged. It will be remembered that he explained to the constables when apprehended that the blood on his knife was caused in cutting a piece of beef, but wben before the magistrates he made another statement with referance to the blood-stains on the weapon. He then seid he had knocked his hand against something, brealing the skin oft the knuckles, leaving it hanging there, and showed a scar on his finger where the wound was; that he took out his claspknife and cut off the skin, and thus blood came about the=nife. He also stated that, the weather being cold, he puthishandinto his pocket, wvhich occasioned the blood found in the pocket shown before the coroner's jury. With respect to the blood on the cuff of his coat, be said he had had two teeth taken out on the 23d of December, and that he wiped his mouth with his coatsleeve. The prisoner frequently went out wvith the gipsy tribe. TNation uually carried a " good knife" (of which he frequently boasted) and a revolver when he was out. Hle had been leading rather a rambling life up to within a fortnight b efore the murder, when he was employed by Mgr. Paln,er, of Huish Champflower, who had found bins, work before, and seemed, on the whole, satisfied with his conduct. The deceased, John Aplin, was the son or poor parents, who bear a good character, and the young man was about to be married to a sespectoble young woman in that class of life. AusrtANiAx POLiCAL ECONOMy.-TO know why properbg is depreciated in this colony, and how that property is to be retrieved in value and wages sustained, are elements of a problem demanding primary consideration. Wvere we to confine the instance to Geelong, it aight be asked, from what cause springs the decadence in the value of property ? The answer might be a plausible one, and at the first glance satisfactory. It might be alleged that the settlement of the colony denuded the town of a superilnous population, and dispersed them through the interior; it n igit be alleged that capitalists who invested mnoney in c,sant.-y lancds were mere speculators. Both causes are a orthy of consideration, but do not meet the question at issue. There is an evident crumbling away of everything into which colonial enterprise centres. There appears to be a dispensation abroad which encourages the few who have money to hug it. and entails ruin on all those-who, by using capital, employ labour, benefit the colony, and ruin themselves. Instead of inquiring why this state of things should be-instead of submitting to them passively, and trusting " that when things are at the worst they will mend," we would counsel examination, which, if entered upon, would lead to a monetary cause and a currency solution. The wants, the luixuies of the population axe not lessened, but the nieans to represent these wants and luxuries we lack-and why' Because the amount of money doled out to us is liuwited, and comnparatively with that our enterprise is unlimited, axd falls under the undue domination of alien capitaL While such a system endures the property of the coloniy will retrograde. Barter of raw gold for foreign merchandie wil go on, but colonial settlement will not. There ivill be no permanent prosperity in AVictoria, so long es the chief portion of the population is engaged in snera,istrihution of imported articles, paid for by the sacrifiie of the sroduce of the digging interest. There is not an ounce of goldrased hutpays an impost to foreign capital-hut is subverted to English uses, cheapened when in ou hands, hut appreciated to the English standard directly ft passes into-the hank. There is not an ounce of gold raised that ought to leave the colony until the wants ofthe colonists are fulfilled; and were there a mint, the sacrifice apiken of would be obviated. The more gold there 'W3 coined the better would be the position of property and of wages. So long as our sovereign r-ould pans among ourselves at full value, the exporter of gold would not be able to get hold of it for less than 20s. If the Governrment would give Il)s. per om, the banks would not be able to buy atN7L per oz. Th6sdiffer ence in price would be saved to the colony, but far mor, than the difference in price would the colony advantage bs a monetary medium constantly supp`eso anId -,ly linited t demand. If tbe landholder, the householde, the digge; the agriculturist, the labourer, could be brought calmly see their true interests, tbeir extrication f; Om embarabt ment would be evident, and could be pointed out clearly but llong as a hmited amnount or capit. supplemented bS b vge credits, iruperils our Victoria, and the gold interest is neglected, property will continue to decline in value, ethough thee c beepealed, tbe h ailot maintained, triennial Parlianen ts:vsde thelaw *f the land, esd pro. perty qual-ification be abolished.-Gceloungr 2.-Tc?
IRELAND. OPRoX OV3 OWN OoRRSPzsoNDz.T.) DUBITN, WID)NESDAY MO}N=G. ARRIVAL OF LORD CAISLE. 'The return of Lord Carlisle to the seat of his government puts an end for the present to all the rumours respecting his resignation. His Excellency arrived in Kingstown last night at a quarter to 1i o'clock by special steainer, which left Holyhead at 6 o'clock in the evening, He was accompanied 'by Captain Everard (private secretary) and the Hon. Captain EiMis. On the steamer arriving at Kingstown his Excellency was received by Lord St. Lawrence, Captain Vesey, R.N., Aide-de-Camp; Captain Wiv'lliams (controLler of the household), Captain *Willis, Captain Paget Butler, Dr. Hatchell, Dr. flughes, and M;r. Mtullet. The viceregal party started for tow n by the 11 o'clock train, and arrived at the Wvestland-row terminus at half-past 11, when i3s Excellency departed for the viceregal lodge. THE TIPPERtRvY BANK. The Limerick JRepo*2es- publishes a letter from the town of Tipperary, dated Monday, which states that zapneeting was held there that day of the two parties -doEeerned in the settlement of the affairs of that viretched concern. The compromisers were headed by the Earl of B3essborough, and the non-compromisers were represented by their solicitor, Mr. Edmund Power. The meeting was private, but it was believed that, after a stormy discussion, the war-tothe-knife party yielded to the more reasonable mode of winding up suggested by the Dubliri Conference. Ford Bessborough presided, and MIr. r'Dowell, the of ficial manager, was among those present. A letter from Clonmel mentions that the head branch of the Ml-fated joint-stock bank in that town, in which the Sadleir gang concocted the frauds whieh have been the source of woe to maniy, is about to be converted into a provision store. The Carlow quarter sessions were opened yesterday before Sir Coleman O'Loghlen, and there, too, the affairs of the ubiquitous Tipperary Bank formed a portion of the business. The correspondent of the Freemntam's JTo)unml vrites,- " The civil bils were goae into yesterday, and it was anticipated that those at the suit of the offlicial manager of the Tipperary Bank would be proceeded with, but while I was in court 1 did not hear any of them called on, and I believe if say entries were made they were agaiost p,ersons residing in the Queen's County, or Graig district, and that they will be heard by the assistant-barrister of the Qu!neen's County. It is amusing to hear the people talk of Sadlleir sad his bask, and of the defences that aere intooded to be made in some cases wlhere persons are liable on bills and on money advanced. They say that the understanding or agreement vas thab they ,were never to be asked for the mooney if they rendered ,certain services to Sadleir at the Carlow election. Those intended defences are most probably fictitious; but I have heard several persons say that they are intended to be made. TXhe fact is, that the people who are really debtors to the bank persnuade themselves that there is nothing morally ,wrong in endeavouring to evade their liability by any devio or stratagem they can have recourse to, and that as Sadleir robbed the people of their deposits no one ought to pay a shilling ou any account. One man has been sued for something above twenty pounds, whose brotber lost forty, and bhe thinks his debt ought to be set off against his brother's loss. On the whole there is a fixed determination on the .part of the debtors to the bank to pay nothing-some of them have left the country, and others are determined to -try what the Insolvent Court will do for them, and it is anticipated that we shall have a good number of suitors here -of that character at the next sessions." IRE MARQUIS OF WATERFORD. The Marquis of Waterford, while out tiding on -Saturday, fell from his horse and sustained some injury, which, however, is not likely to lead to any -serious consequences. Hlis Lordship's head was cut and he remained insensible, it is said, for nearly lalf-anl-hour. Accounts of yesterday's date state that the Marquis is recovering from the effects of the accident. T3E LATE RAILWAY FRAI3S. An inquisition, directed underthe great seal, was commenced yesterday before the conurissioners appoited for the purpose-Mr. Henry O'Hara and Mr. F. IV. Brady-in the Nisi Prius Court, to ascertain the extent of the property of all kinds belonging to J. M. Knighting at the time of his conviction. It will be remembered that he was chief clerk in the transfer-office of the Great Southern and Western Railway Company, and that in March last he was arrested on a charge of forgery and uttering a forged transfer involving fraud upoI the company to a very large amount. He was tried at the Commission of -Oyer and Terminer, was acquitted on the count for forgery, and convicted on that of knowingly uttering a forged transfer; for this felony he was sentenced to six years' penal servitude. The Crown -claimed all his property on the ground that he is a convicted felon ; .hat in law he is dead and has no rights. The invesdigation took place before a special ,city jury. MIessrs. Corballis, Q.C., and Robert Griffin appeared on the part of the Crown, with Mr. W. Kemimis, the Crowin Solicitor. Messrs. Fitzgibbon, Q.C., Coffey, and C. Barry attended on behalf of the railway company, for whom Sir Matthew Barrington, acted as solicitor; and Messrs. Hayes, Q.C., and Byrne appeared for Mr. Knighting, who was represented by Mr. :Shane, as his solicitor. The convict was present during the proceedings, in custody of two -of the turnkeys of the prison in which he is -confined. Several witnesses were examined by the Crown to show what property Mr. Knighting was possessed of when committed. It appeared by their evidence that he was the owner of a considern%ble amount of land in the counties of Meath and l.ongford, and house property in the city of Dublin ;producing a rental of several hundreds of pounds per annum, together with other property, consisting of bonds, bills, promissory notes, &c., to the value of from 7,0001. to 8,0001. The exact amount of the convict's assets cannot be ascertained until the proceedings close. The inquiry is not concluded, and is to be resunied this day. THE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

HOIV SHIPS MAY BE LOST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to call the attention of shipowners, ship in. surers, masters of vessels, map and chart sellers, the Admiralty, tho Trinity-house, and the public in general to the following fa0t :-I went recently from Liverpool to Glasgow by a steasmvessel, of which I enclose the name, but, as 1 do not wish to prejudice any ship or person, I leave the publication of tbe name to your editorial judgment. I examined the charts on board, and to my amazement I saw that Corsewell lighthouse (one of the most important lighthousus in the _-ig.tion of the west coast, and the light for Loch Ryan-a refuge often sought by ships in bad weather) was on the chart actually placed on the wrong side of the point of land on which the lighthouse is situated. This statement wiUl appear incredible to many perzons, and -therefore I give my name and address and the name of the ship. Tho fact can bo easily verified. The master of the ship was of course acquainted with the fact, and had marked m pencil the true position of the light; but is it not snonstrous that charts, and recent charts, should be sold to ships with such a glaring error staring one in the face ? A foreig:a shipmastor trying to niake Loch Ryan with ithat chart would run bis sbip dead on shore, and an insurance company would be justified in refusing to pay -the daniuge, on the ground that the ship was improperly found in the requisites of navigation. Corsewell is not far froni Portpatrick, where the OAion was run upon the rocks an-d many lives lost; yet here are vessels navigatir.g the same sea with a cbart that is so execrably bad that scarcely a name on the Ayrshire coAst is spelt correctly, end the soundings are atrodiously incorrect. Although a landsman, I bappen to knowy something of that coast, and I would faus point out another circusnstance. Ships are sometimes los0 at Girvan and thereabouts. Within my memory sseveral have been cast away there, and, if I mistake not, som4e)diarabber manufacturer has chosen one of those sad -caleasuties for an illustrative drawving, in which one man is made to reach the shore. Yet on that same shore there is a reef about a mile from the land, within which reef any of those ships could have found shelter, even in the heaviest gale. Yet neither the reef nor the soundings are given on the charts used by the Glasgowv and Liverpool steamers. Wll you allow mne to point out another want in our oasting navigation ? On the east coast of Scotland there isno point so important as St. AbV's Hlead. All ahips making the coast of Ecotland for the Fsxth of Forth would make St. Abb's if they could. .All ships driven to the north of the Syrc (some i saw in this condtion lately) would make St. Abb's, with its bold shore and deep water-not like the Isle of tay, wherca *ship may be on shore before she knows where ahais-yet ships are lost in St. Andrew's-hay and elsewhere because there is no heist on St. AIsh's. Shipmasters in recent times have %eef punished for losing sbips, but is there no punishment for the sellers of charts wlho sell rubbish that would actually lead a master to lse his ship? Why not pass a lav oran "insurance reonhstion" that no chart shall be considered official if it have mot the official stamp of the Trinity-house or Admiralty ? Is it 1,ot an infamous scandal that shiA do actuaily sail with such abominable charts? I am, Sir, your obedient servant. : P. EDWARD DOVR (3, Torphichen-street, Edinburgh, Dec. 29.
THE SCHOOL'S BEAL DIFFICULTY. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TrMES. Sir,-The dregs of most matters which afford theni are of a nasty disaereeable nature; the dregs of human society ever have been and will prove to be so. It is at this time the popular idea that our refuse population is our criminal population; that if we could reduce its amount, in the same proportion should we purge ourselves of crime. It is argued that education wiUl act upon the lowest scoiurng of social lif a3s pealt charcoal and lime do upon the contents of our cesspools and drains. I am one of those who put little faith in the operation of education per se as a purilier of our worst classes of fellow-creatures, even of education in which the very best secular and religious instruction should be combined. I should as soom expect to find the lenses of the best microscope doing their work properly in a damp cellar or in a bDuilding set aside for the sifting of cinders. Englishmen boast of their love of fairplay, and yet they send tens of thousands of children daily home from school to fight a foe at hon e, or rather a host of foes, with no better weapons ihan a little book and pen knowledge, with no better armour than that amount of religious and moral principle which can be given each day to young children in crowded schools. Speeches on education are, as I well know, very easily made, it is a " stock subject ;" even aclumsy handling of it wil ever elicit the cheers of crowded audiences. Most men give something or do something to aid one or more schools, and they receive as grateful tribute to their own charity in so doing every allusion to the value of education. Every man at a meeting to promote education takes to himself, within himself, a sort of pleasurable sensation arising from the conviction that he is one of "the blessed." The speakers panegyrize when they declaim on the glorious fields opened to the educated classes, and the true blessings they hourly derive in those fields. Call a meeting in a county town to consider the " glorious fields" to which the children of agricultural labourers too often daily return from school; call a meeting in a manufacturing district to consider the nature of the dwellings in which, at high rents, the mechanics are condemned to rear their children ; and then mark the attendance and the reception you will receive. It is wonderful to many-rot to me-how comparatively easy it is to get up heavy subscription lists for the building of schools, the erection and decoration of churches and chapels, while it is next to impossible to push the " dwellina question " beyond that point which consists in a simple acknowledgment of the difaculties which beset it, and pious ejaculations with regard to the horrors it embodies. We are ready to wage any amount of paper war upon the question whether a gentleman holding heretical views as to the moon's motion is a fitting person to be an inspector of schools; we forgetI that three-fourths of the children in any school which his peculiar form of lunacy can corrupt wiU go home to sleep, eat, &c., in common with many of both sexes, in a space in which the rotatory motion popularly known as the " swinging of a cat" could not, for want of space, be accomplished. Even a Chadwick would shrink from such a cup of Tantalus as a cesspool that filled at the rate of hogsheads of filth to his drams of " disinfecting fluid," and yet England sets the schoolmaster, and, above all, the schoolmistress, to do a harder, more hopeless tasl. They have to teach truth, purity, honesty, industry, religion to children who return each day to homes in which life itselfhuman life-is almost a lie, purity barred out by necessity, honesty too often an exotic which cannot in health survive the climate; industry interpreted to mean simply the principle of " getting," no matter how; as to religion-the wheat is dibbled, but the tares are sown broadcast, and that in a clirmate so physically impure that the leaves of the charity-given Bibles turn damp beneath the toueb, and their familiar binding has its white spots of fungoid growth. It is true, Sir, for I and many others have done it; men of " the upper ten thousand" will go and look at how the labourer is lodged in many villages, how he is lodged in almost every town, as a matter of curious investigation, and then return and talk and write about what they saw, as if they had gone into the habitations of the offscourings of some foreign barbarian land. I shall be told that out of those dweUings have come some of our very best mechanics; that there are thousands of honest, high-princoipled labourers who have been bred in the one room ; that many a soul goes to its Maker strong injfaith in its Redeemer from these filthy, crowded abodes. I don't deny it. I know how light does pierce into darkness in many an extraordinary way. An ardent naturalist will scarcely find one thing on earth, however foul in itself, that will not generate something, vegetable or animal, in which the glorious wonders ef Providence are most manifest; but we do not seek to hoard fever-breeding matters in tons because in a drop of such the microscopist can find the germs of strange, bealutiful organisms. I would not be thought to undervalue the oreat efibrts ever making by pious individuals and religious secieties to penetrate these dark and foul abodes of " the dregs" of our population; they are about a great work, and deserve all honour; but I am satisfied that the evil is an increasing evil. We improve our great thorouglhfares at the cost of a stiU further foul crowding of our alleys and back streets. Model lodgiughouses are texts from which to preach; hitherto little has been done to expound practically the truths they teach. I do not say that all the deeds of violence against which there is now so just an outcry are the works of men made what they are by the existence of the dwellings in which they have been bred; but I do say that it is folly to expect the criminai's reform when these are to be the scenes in which alone he could hope to work it out. So long as the mind of this great nation can think of no other panacea for vice than education, no preventive of crime but the dread of punishment, no refor-mation of the crimin al but by a course which, prompting to hypocrisy, n)akes the acting out of a lie the shortest road to a remission of punishment, we shal go from bad to wors3. There wil still be blue-books full of astonishing exan.inationsof very wonderful schoolboys, andlengthy statistics to prove the triumphs of penitential penal discipline; meetings will still be ably addressed by men of high degree on the value of education; but, with All this, savage criminal attempts upon life and property will increase until the yoke of daring, unbridled guilt will be beyond bearing. At last it may strike the nation that when the great multitude of its lower classes are forced to dwell where decency and comfort cannot exist, and honesty only under fearful trial, they must be as "1 dregs," the precipitate of a process of moral chymistry which, eliminating all that is poorest, all that is of the worsb of our kind, keeps it closely confined to ferment and breed and harbour alla uecome StliL more obnoxious. ;5.

DIL. YER TO LORD PANMURE. On Tuesday evening Lord Panmure was entertained at a public dinner by the county gentlemen of Forfar, to testify their respect for his Lordship as Lord Lieutenant of tha county, and as an acknowledgment of his public services as MIinister of War. To accommodate all parties in the dis. trict, Arbroath was selected as the most central place of meeting, and the new Market-hall was elegantly decoratedl for the ocesmion. The building is constructed after the model of the nave of the Crystal Palace, and when laid out with tables for a party of 800 gentlemen and briliantly lit up had a very imposing appearance. The company assembled at 4 o'clock, and occupied every seat on the ground floor, while 200 ladies filledthe galleries, The chair was occupied by Sir John Ogilvie, Convener of the county, supported on the right by Lord Panmure, Lord Kinnaird, the Hon. Wiliam Maule, Viscount Melville, Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, Colonel Ogilvie, Mr. Duncan, XP.; and on the left by the Marquis of Breadalbane, the Earl of Soutbesk, the Earl of Kintore, Viscount Duncan, M.P., the Lord Advocate for Scotland, and William J, Baxter, M.P. for the Montrose burgbs. The CHAIXRzAir gave the usual loyal toasts, and called for a special bumper to " the Navy and Army," alluding, in happy terms, to the presence of Admiral Sir Houston Stewart and Viscount Melville, the commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland. The toast was drunk with ims mense enthusiasm, the band of the Forfarshire Artilery corps playing appropriate music. Admairal STEWART, in rising to return thanks for the navy, was lonjg and loudly applauded. He said,-Iread a motto opposite, " Commerce makes all the world akin." But let lue tell you that if you would have your commerce profitable' you must protect it; and if you would have it protected in every part of the world you must be always prepared to uphold your navy. (Cheers.) I see by the newspapers to-day that one of our admuirals has been breaking teacups in China, and this shows, when you view it in connexion with protection to your conmmerce, how inuch you have to depend on our British navy. Mly lion. friend in the chair says the British navy issufficientfor all that can be required of it. He isright. gladly reciprocate that fact; for I declare that, after 50 years' service, I never knew the navy in a more efficient state than it is at present. (Cheers.) It is only deficient in one thing,-Nve have very few Scotchmen in it. I am very sorry for this, and I can't understand the reason of it, VisCount MELVILLE returned thanks for the army.--He had no occasion to complain of any reluctance on the part of Scotelmen to eniter the army, whatever might be the experience of his gallant friend in regard to their unwillingness to enter the navy. While there had been no want of recruits for the regular service there had been a cheerful readiness to come forward in the militia, especially in that Iart oE the country where they were then assembled. bhey had drunk with enthusiasm the toast of "the Army and F'avy." He was proud of the army. Dispersed as it was all over the globe, it had opportunities of active service wvhich prepared it for great enmergencies, and the experience of the late war had shown how important it wvas to have a sufficient force thus always ready. He did trust that if ever they were again te he engaged in such a war they would guard against the dangers of a divided command, for nothing could be more disastrous than divided counsels, and nothing more essential to success than that one mind should be charged with the full responsibility of the suprenie command. (Cheers.) The CHAIRMAN then gave the toast of the evening, "the health of Lord Panmure." After eulogizing his lordship as the Lord Lieuteiiant of the county, he referred in highly laudatory terms to his corduct as Minister-at-War. He said, he had not displaced but succeeded the Duke of Newcastle, and he was glad to find that the country was now generously viewing that noble lord's conduct in its true light, and he felt assured it would yet do him justice. Lord PAzrSIuRE, on rising, was received with long-conti. nued applause. After remarking at some length on his local connexion with the county, and congratulating the meeting on its present prosperous state, he said,-I will now address a few words on the second ground on which this compliment has been paid. You bave been pleased to signify by this great assembly the approbation of my native county of my public course as a public man. I may safely say that I have rendered these services, of which you have been pleased to approve, without hope of such a reward as this; and I believe, were it not for the familiar friendship that bas inspired this assemblage, that I deserve nothing more than the man who las simply done his daty in the place to which Providence has called him. (Cheers.) It is quite true, as has been said by Sir John Ogilvy, I did not seek the office in which I am placed. It was offered me. Cogent reasons were stated for my acceptance, and, among others, my familiarity with the habits of the British army (cheers), from having served an apprenticeship as a soldier, and from my acquaintance with the management of the British army from having been six years Secretary of War. These were the recommendations which were urged as fitting nme for office. I never besitated for a moment, from the circamstances of the times, in accepting that office. (Cheers.) I saw, as others did, the state into which, from circumstances over which no man had any control, the army in the Crimea had unfortunately fallen, but I saw, too, that that army was rallying from these cireumstances. And I had sueh reliance on the British soldiery, and on the intelligence and energy of the cficers of the British army, that I was quite sure any responsibility I might have with regard to the army itself would be light if I would only trust to the army and those who composed it. (Cheers.) There were circumstances certainly connected with the army in the Crimea which called for immediate and active measures. I have stated to you, and Sir John Ogilvy has repeates' it, that the army in the winter o 1854-55 had faUen into a condition which aroused the in dignation and excited the deepest sympathy of the British nation. No man seemed well to know to what circum. stances to attribute so heavy a disaster; and I made it my duty, with the consent of my colleagues, to send out two gentlemen to inquire into the nature of these circumstances-not for the purpose of seeking victims for pablic indignation to punish, for I think that has been somewhat misconstrued as tha intention of the appointment of Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tnlloch,-but to gain information, so that we might know the errors which had been committed, and be able to avoid them on all future occa-ions. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, the people of England are not naturally a vindictive people ; they desire to see public men properly discharge their puolic duties; they desire to see the omcers of the armny discharge their duties efficientlybut they can make allowances for difficulties. (Cheers.1 And now that these circuirstances have passed away I trust that justice will be dore to the officers, for 1 do believe that every one of these things in the Crimea arose from circumstances over which no man had control; and I do hope, now that they have passed, and that we have sead the lesson, -ud studied the lesson, the people of England will let the matter drop asleep, and not avenge on a single individual that which was the result of a system rather than the fault of any single individual. I have not had any opportunity of recording in public the approbation of the Government of the report of these twogentlemen. (Cheers.) The information in the report was accamulated under many difficulties, made with great fidelity, made, uot with the intention of injuring the feelings of any British officers. butof telling theti.ath. And neitherSirJohnM'.NYcill uor Colonel Tulloch, in placing the statements in my hands, and before the British pubmlic, had the slightest intention of injuring the feelings of any one. (Cheers.) Having stated this much, permit me only to add one sentence in regard to my appointment as Secretary of State; and that is that in all that I did I studied, in the first instance, to follow up what I approved in the conduct of mypredecessor, and many tbings which I worked out took their orlgin in his admuinistration. (Ckeers.) In the first place, it. was my lot, with the aid of my colleagues, to make a radical change.^nd I do not use the term offensively-in the constitution and command of the British army. Already had the Dulke of Newcastle bean establishing a distinct department which would manage the affairs of war in this country. It is rot only essential that such a department should exist in time of war; for, believe rse, there are matters sufficient for a very large departmnent even in times of the most profound peace. (Loud cheers.) I was accused of applying too stoutly to reform during a period of existing war; but the fact was I found we could not carry on the war without the reform, and I determined, whatever the risk, to accomplish the chenge. You will readily believe tte necessity of this when I tell you that till within a year and a few months the Commander-in-Chief had only the cavalry and the infantry under his charge. With the artillery he had nothing to do, and they were placed beside him on the field or in some camp adioining. I have, with the consent of my colleagues, placed the artillery and engineers of this country, as they ought to be, under the immediate command of the Commander-in-Chief. (Applause.) The officer at the head of the army now commands all arms of service. They look to him as their military head, as the fountain of military honour, as the source of military promotion. In doing so we have separated between + -e ciilan At,e miitr portio oteamiita tion of the army; and I have tak-en under the control of the Secretary of State all the civil branch of the administration of the army, which consists in the provision of military material and all the means of carrying on any war, ho,Wever great or extensive it may he. (plue)IConifee-s t-hat, owing to this divided administration, delays had occurred which rendered the efficiency of the se'rvice almost impossible. (Hear.) And from the mnoment that one sinigle eye on the part of the mnilitary commander was spXead over the whole army, and one single eye was spread ovqr its civil administration, we were enabled no sooner to determine than to strike (applause), and everything went on with far greater ease than -when I first assumed the reins of office. Cher Now, gentlemen, I think the present Govern- methtonly done in this what any other Government would have done.if occupying their place. They havelhad the opportunity, and therefore they have gainaedthe credit-. and Isay that it is a credit to any Govern-ment to have simplifleKf and modified the military administration of this country. so thiat-I shall answer, for it, shouldI due necessity call, for it-we could embark any numaber of soldiers tisis -touiitry, may be, called upon to prepide jcnTptqjipn ajll-teir. quipm,ent%. ten days after the o$der bad. bees ghe.. .(Loud, cheers.)

(Applause.) For many yJars England had warred for freedom and for liberty-in support of the weak against the strong. ( tpplause) On this occasion she entered on the combat with these and no other feelings. Contrary to all stijulation of treaty, and in the face of all remonstrances on the part of France and England as well as of Turkey, Russia attempted to disturb that balance of power in Europe upon which the prosperity of this country and its liberty and freedom so essentiay depend. (ApDlause England would be no party to such an attempt. After iuch endeavours had beei nmadeto induce Russia to forego her intentions on thms subject war was declsred, and then, gentlemen, was returned a despatch which must have proclaimed to all the world that England, when she wars with one mind, is invincible (cheers)-even though all the world were against her. (Loud cheers.) We haveseen great rarlike sights in former times, but be it remembered that that was in times when our shores were threatened and when our homes and altars were supposed to be endangered. No wonder though England, Scotland, and Ireland then rose as one man to defend interests so dear to them. (Cheers.) Bat upon the present occasion it was not so. Our formidable foes are now our most attached allies. (Cheers.) Long may they continue so (loud cheers); long mnay commerce make us akin, and long may thoee ties of friendship so firmly existing between us continue to subsiat in their present strength. (Cheers.) She was formerly our formidable foe, but now, gentlemen, our hearths were in no danger, our altars were free from risk of profanation; we -were in the enjoyment of the most profound peace, and yet the nation, awakened with one voice, arose as one man to approve the declaration of this war, and her sword leaped from the scabbard to prosecute it. (Cheers.) Party spirit vanished before the declaration of war; there was almost alall of politics; the Commont gave up their economy (laughter) and adopted an unbounded generosity, and the people exhibited a patience under taxation (laughtqr) which was trmly admirable. (Cheers.) And, gentlemen, not content with exhibiting this patience under taxation, they TolUntaily taxed themselves to form that Patriotic Fund which will ever remain a monument of what a people can do when their hearts are in their work. (Cheers.) And not only so, but they voluntarily subscribed funds to supply the wants of our sick and wounded soldiers and sailors abroad, whereby many a man who had sacrificed health in his countrys service found comfort at their hands which he woul not else have found. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, there is another feature twhich :has distinguished this war, upon which we must all look with pride and satisfaction. In former wars we had prowling about outr ports things caUed pressgangs (hear), and we had our militia driven to the parade by the compulsory ballot. (Hear.) On this occasion we have never heard a word of the presagang or the compulsory ballot. (Cheers.) Our fleets have been manned and our army recruited by the voluntary enlistment of the youth of the country. And it s a matter of the greatest pride for the nation to be able to stand up in the face of the world and say that nwithout conscription or rsn' her sons sn a lust cause will ever raLly around her. on-. hae seen what your army and navy are canable of doing-oun have seen a large army uccumuLbted on the shores of an enemny's country at a vast distance from their native shores. (Cheers.) We owe that to the capability of the navy, and to the exertions of that sister service; but we owe that sister service more-and I say it in the presence of my friend Sir Houston Stewart-we owe that sister service a debt of gratitude for the nmaner in which she brought that army home from the East, and rescued it from the perils to which it would have been exposed. Under Sir iIouston Stewart's able direction-for his senior officer was then at home-that army, of not less than 80,000 men at least, whatever more, was embarked from the Crimea and landed safely upon the shores of Europa. (Cheers.) And I may here add that, as a tribute to that army, there was not a regiment of it which landed upon English shoreswhether English, Scotch, or Irish-that was not passed in review before Her Majesty herself, and to the men in whose ranks she did not hetwelf address some sympathizing words. (Cheers.) It was my good fortune to see the fir4t formation of that army at Aldershott, when reviewed by Her Majesty --it was my good fortune to sre the officers of that army called together into a square; and never till the latest day I live shall I forget the speech than made by the Queen to those officeis, nor the tears which trickled over the manly beards of some of those officers when they heard these words fall from Her Majesty. (Cheers.) And now, gentlemen, one word with regard to the fature. You have seen, as I have stated, what your services of the navy and armY can do for you when called effectively into action. Peace has now returned; but, although peace has returned, she is like a bird flying back at present to her tree, and, although she may have alighted on the branch, her wings are not yet fairly settled to her side. (Applause.) I would hope and trust that this country will not be in too great a hurry to insist upon returning to what are called peace establishments (cheers), and not only to clean the sword, but to insist upon hanging it up to rust against the wall. (Cheers.) There is a medium m all things; and I believe we may study economy, and at the same time preserve efficiency. (Cheers.) I believe wo may look forward to the maintenance of good efficient forces both in the army and in the navy, but at the same time considerable relief from the taxation of the war. But I believe at the same time that it would be the most ill-timed economy suddenly to cut down that which you have so efficiently raised l and to bring back the country into a state from which when war lately occurred, it cost millions to rescue it. (Cheers.) When my hon. friend who represented me in the House of Commons moved last year the army and navy estimates, they amountedtonolessa sum than 34,000,0001.; but to give you some idea that I am not exactly talldng without book, when I am saying that great effidency may be maintained and yet relief from taxation achieved, I can promise you that these estimates this year will not come within 20,000,000l. of what they did last year. (Cheers.) And all I ask and all I hope for is that this country will well coisider the necessity of maintaining in these unsettled times a navv sufficient to defend our coasts at home and our possessions abroad, and an army fitted to send troops to the field, as well as perform the duties of those vast and extensive foreign possessions to which my noble friend the Commander-in-Chief for Scotland so lately referred. (His Lordship sat down amid loud and protracted cheering.) After the toast of `Our Allies in the Field," which was dlaly honoured, di 1. SheriffLoGA proposed "The United States of America, and Permanence to the Friendly Relations between the two Countries." (Applause.) ' The toast was received with all the honours. Mr. T. STrxEx, United States' Consul, in his reply, said-The toast proposed by the learned sheriff comprises two particulars-" The Prosperity of America" and "IPermanence to the Friendly Relantions between the two Countries." Now, without detaining you for more than a moment with statistics, allow me to call your attention to the past growth of the country in a few points, as an indication of what may be expected in the future. Acaording to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the agricultural and manufacturing production of the country was, in round numbers, in 1840, 201,227,0001.; in 1855, according to the censns of 1850, and estimates, the production was 520,473,0001.-more than doubling in 15 ]ears. In 1844 the estimated amount of gold and silver in the country was 20,000,0001. In 1855 the Mint estimated the gold and silver at 40,000,0001., and the Treasury Department at 50,000,0001. Again, the effect of reciprocal free trad is shown by the fact that in the year 1853, the year before the reciprocity treaty between the United States and the British North American Provinces went into effect, the exports from the United States to said provinces was, in round numbers, 1,491,0001., and the imports from said provinces 1,510,0001. In the year 1856 the exports of Amencan products to said provinces amounted to 4,543,0001., and the inports from thcm into the United States to 4,262.0001. Now, the progress and policy of a nation of 30,000,000 of people, whose materi progression is such as this, cannot be to you indifferent or unimportant. (Cheers.) Both peoples will have free speech and a free press. They will not, as of old, go into the market streats simply to learn what has been said or done in their immediate neighbourhood; they will have their newvspaper to tell them the ocourrences of the day, and of every day in their town, county, kingdom, and the wvorld. They will grumble at it, dictate to it, laugh at it-do everything but do without it. (Cheers.) He must be a superficial reasoner indeed who doss not perceive, wrapt in the thunders of Tre Ti2mes, and the genial humour and flowing wit of Punach, principle and philosophy which is continually carrying them, as well as others, along towards a higher appreciation of truth, of other's rights, and universal justice, toward the aim and end of the press, the diffusion of truth, and the cultivation and advocacy of true manners and morals, and public virtue in sopiety and Government. (Cheers.) I believe in the continuance and constantly increasing strength of the good fceling now existing between us, because I recollect that during the pendency of most of those questions which have agitated 2nd divided the two countries, there have alwal s been on both sides far-seeing statesmen and true patriots wh) have agreed in their views of the ther existing qtiestion. ( eers.) Mr. BAXTER, UP. for the burghs, proposed " The Agricultural Interest," (Great cheering.) Various other toasts of local interest followed, and the meeting separated before 10 o'clock.

SIR DE LACY EVANS AT INKERRANN. TO THE EDITOP. OF THE TIMES. Sir,-An offior on the Staff has thought fit to inform the public, "on the very highest authority," too, "that Sir De Lacy Evans never spoke to General Pennefather til the Battle of Inkerman was over." I beg to contradict this egregious assertion. In the very front of the Inkermann fight, in the very thick of a tremendous fire, I saw Sir De Lacy Evans conversing with-indeed, apparently giving directions to-General Pennefather. 'Who can "the very highest authority" be that has tempted a staff officer to admit such spiteful gossip into a work dubbed Reolitiesof the War in t7e CGpi71eo 2 I am, Sir, your obedient servant. C.

TRANSPORTATION TO CANADA. TO THE EDITOB3 OF THE TEIMS. Sir,-I hope you will excuse my again troubling you on Canadian afAirs, but I cannot let the letter of A. K. Isbister," in Thit T1i2 of the 2h, pass without, as a Canadian, raising my voice against the injustice that he would perpetrate on the British North American provinces, by establishing a penal settlement at Hudson's Bay. Why could not England just as well select some of her own northern islands for this purpose as to be tzoubling other people with her rogues and vagabonds? It would be just as easy to escape from Hudson's Bay to Canadaas from some of the northe-n islands to ScDtland. It may be supposed by persons unacquainted, with North America and the Indian tribes that the Indians would prevent the escape of the white prisoners through their country, but you would find that these very Indians would be the means of enablng the felons to escape. Let 20 resolute omen once get away from the establishment, they wouldimmediatelyseize all the arms, amnmunition, &c., that they required from the first tribe of Indians they met, and, so far from the lndians attempting to arrest them, ihey would slink away as a band of jackalls would from a lion passing through their midst. The Iadians between Hudson's Bay and Canada are not the men they once were, but complete slaves. What with the rigour of the climate and the cupidity of the Hon. Hudson's Bay Company these poor natives are reduced to such a state of destitution as to be completely broken down in ,pirit-se much so, that the Indians sent in search of Sir John Franklin were not selected, as might be supposed, from those nearest to the fieid of action, but from the tribes settled in free Canada. Therefore, if, as is proposed, your convicts were located on land for the purpose of supporting themselves by farming, the firt thing we should hoar of in Canada would be .hat a large band of armed desperadoes from Hudson's Bay were plundering the peaceful backwood settlers of Canada.; we should have to caU out our local militia as the only force competent to cope with this description of marauders, and te put toan. enormous yearly expenditure to protect our border settlements. : This, perhaps, in the end.would be the best thing that could happen, for we should then be obliged to make such a remonstrance to the home Government that they would see the necessity of attachiog that part of Canada, now called the Hon. Hudson'!sBay Company's Territory, to thepresent, eivilized par, and by that means free the Indian tribes from their worse than Southern slavery. But all this would only tend to create hard feeings between Canada and England. Why should England, now that by wise concessions she has made Canada an ultra-loyal colony, take such steps as 'must exasperate its inhabitants ? The truthmayas well he spoken out, as for every one to know but not acknowledge it, Canada among Canadians means all that part of British North America called Canada East, Canada West, and the Hudson's Bay Company's Terriory. ,We,aThknowihat there isa chartergragted to the Ron.

* THO &:V.E" A -YD "T &E oTHER. ' TO TEIE EDITOP. OF THE T1 S. i tr,-Aa you were good enough to insert inaTh Timzes of last Thursday a letter in which I sholved, by means of several vxtractsfroin Dryden's prose works, that he used the two terms ' tlEe one" and "Ithe other," when contrasting persong er things, intercbangeably, sometintes using 'the one" ia the senre of " the former," and sometimees of "the lstter," and so of "the other," I now troublc you. with instances, "Thick as autumnal leaves that straw the brooks "In 'Vall',mbrosa," taken mainly frons Lord Bolingbroke's Diasertotion on Parties, to show that that distingoshed writer uliforialy, so far as I have ohserved, used "the one" in the sense of "the former," and "the other" in the sense of "the' latter." I do not profess to have looked through the whole of Lord Bolingbroke's works for the purpose of ascertaining in what sense he used the terms in question, but only his Letter to Sir William Windhamc, his Di5sertation on Parties, his Iea of a Pvfrio. King, and one or two of his ninor treatises. 1. "The two men. who had the greatest appearance of favonr and power were D'Aguesseau and Nonilles. One was made Chancellor, on the death of Voisin, from AttorneyGeneral, and zbe other was placed at the head of the Treasury."-Lctter to Sir W. Wzind/jam. VoL L, p. 14L Bohn's 8vo edition. 1S44. 2. "There is, after all, a real and a wide difference between moraland party justice. The one is founded inz reason; the other takes its colour from the passions of mhen, and is but another name for injustice."-jiss. oz. Parties. VoL II., p. 33. 3. " Hereditary, indefeasible right, passive obedience, and non-resistance, those corner-stones, which are an improper foundation for any Euperstructure but that of tyranny, were made eveu by Parliament the foundation of the monarchy; ancd all those who declined an ea ' ;.d strict conformnity to the whole establishment of the courch, even to the most minute parts of it, were deprived of the protection, nay, exposed to the prosecution of the State. Thus, one part of the nation stood proscribed bv the other-the least, indeed, by the greatest."-IDid, pp. 3637. 4. " The death of my Lord Southampton, and the disgrace and bauishmnent of my Lord Clarendon, made room for new canses of jealousy and dissatisfaction, and the effects increased in proportion. These two noble lords had stood in the breach against Popery and foreign polities; and what one of them said of the other-that is, Southampton of Clarendon-may be applied 'with justice to both."-I&id, p. 38. 5. " WhF n a free people lie under any grievance,or apprehend any danger, and tryto obsain their Prince?s consent to deliver them from one, or urevent the other, a flat refusal on his Dart reduces them to the melancholy alternative of contin;ing to submit to one and to stand exposed to the other, or of freeing themselves from both, without his consent."-Ibid, pp. 65-66. 6. "The cavils which may be mf-de and the facts 'which may be cited, some of older and some of fresher date, against what hath been said do not escape me. Men of knowledge, and of cool and candid thought, will answer one andaccontfor the other, without any help."-Ibid, pp. 79-80. 7. " A second possible division is that of men averse to the Government because they are so to the constitution, which f think can never be the case of many; or, averse to the constitution because they are so to the Government, which I thinlk may be the case of more. Both of these would tend to the same point. One would subvert the Governmuent that 2ey might change the constitution. The other would sacri ce the constitution that they might subvert the Governjmsent."-Ibid, pp. 86- 87. 8. "Ina word-adto bring this home to our own case,constitution is the rule by which our Princes ought to govern at all times. Government is that by which they actuaUy do govern at any piarticular time. One may remalin immutable; the other may, and as human nature is constituted, must vary. One is the criterion by which we are to, try the other."-Ifid, p. 89. 9. " A good Government can want no power under the present constitution.. A bad one may, and it is fitit should. Popolarity is the expedient of one, and wi31 effectuaUy support it. Nothing bat corruption can support the other." -T!pid, P. 95. 10. " Sedition was temporary anarchy. A dictator was a tyrant for six months, unless he thought fit to abdicate sooner. The constitution was suspended and endangered by both. It might have been destroyed by the exceeses of one; at was destroyed by the bare duration of the other."- id, p. 122. 11. "But to resume the comparison of other constitutions of Government with our own, I say, that if the Gothic constituLtion in Spain, either bv original defects, or by deviating from, and not being reduced again in time to its first principles, was destroyed through the corruption of Parliament, and by the force of an army, one of which betrayed, and the other conquered the Commons of Castile, &c." Ibid, P. 132. 12. " The great ability of this hlinister,* on which hi3 whole merit with a greedy master was raised, consisted in making his administration a system of violence and fraud, in order to plunder and enslave the people. When he durst not employ one he turned himself to the other.'Ibid, p. 137. 13. "tMinisters, for instance, may be called to account by the passion, by the prejudice, if you will, of such assemblies oftener, perhaps, than they deserve to be ; or. their errors maybe censured or their faults be pnished in a greater degree and with more rigour not oily than true political justice requires, which should always be tempered with mercy, but even than strict justice exacts. But as one of these is a fault, if it be a fault, on the best side. and as the other will certainly happen very seldom, it doe3 not seem reasonable that a door should be opened to corrup. tion and dependency in order to prevent them."-Ibid, p. 146, 147. 14. " The power of the Crowvn to corrupt, and the prone. ness of the people pstobe corrupted, must continuetoincrease, unless a stop be put to the'growing wealth ane power of one, and the growing depravity of the other."-I'bid.., p.. If there were any such rule as that alleged respecting the use of " the one" in the sense of "the latter," and of " the other" in the sense of " the former," by all correct writers, how is it that Dryden, "the father of English critieism,' so frequently violated the rule, and B.Aingbroke so uni. formnly, as far as I have observed, in the treatises before mentioned, did the same ? Ignorance of a well known rule of composition cannot be charged against such writers. An occasional departure from the alleged rule would be one thing, but the frequent violation of it inthe one caso, and tha uniform non-observance of it in the other, is quite a different thing. The inference is irresistible that in the times of Dryden and Bolingbroke, at all events, no such rule as that alleged existed. But I do not stop with BoDingbroke. I wiU show. that Hume and Burke are no less open than yourself to the chaTge of a wrong use of the terms in question. First, with reference to Hume s 15. " For the same reason, it is more easy to account for the rise and progress of commuerce in any kingdom, than for that of learning; and a State which should apply itself to the encouragement of the one would be more assured of successthan one which should cultivate the other."-Essay XIV., part 1. The Bi-se of Arts and Sc2tesce, voL I, p. 106, edit. 182. 16. " Comp are the works of art with those of nature. The one are but imitations of the other."-Essay XVIL, part 1. The Pktonist. Ibid., 153. Now for Burke:- 17. " It is worth observing how we feel ourselves affected in reading the characters of Cnsar and Cato, as they are so finely drawn and contrasted ill Salnst.± In one the ignos.eesdo, largiundo; in the other, niZ leigiu7nd4. In. one, the oniscrs7i, perfugiuni.; in the other, nca1is psi' niciera."-On. the Sufisie en7d .anutifnl, part lit., section 10 18. "Mr. Locke has somewhere observed, with his Tsual sagacity, that most general rords, those belonging to virtua and vice, good and evil, especially, are taught bgefore the particular modes of action to w hich they belong are presented to the mind; and wfith them the love of the one, and the abhorrence of the other."-Itbid. Part V., section 3. 19. " Those who cultivate the memory of our Revolution and those who are attached to the constitution of this kingdom will take good care how they a.ra involved with persons 'who, under tne pretext of zeal towards the Revolution and constitution, too frequently wander from their true principles, and are ready on every occasion to depart from. the firm, bht cautious and deliberate spirit which produced the one and which presides ia the other." In the following instance, however, Mr. Burke uses "the one" in the sense of " the latter," and " the other" ia the sense of " the former." 20. "Scipio and Cato are both virtuous characters; bht we are more deeply affected by the violent death of the one and the run of the great cause he adhered to than with the deserved triumphs and uninterrupted success of the other. Essay on2 the Suilie an2d Beaietifuf, Sart 1, section xir. Thus out of the 20 foregoing examples there is only one in which "I he one" is used in the sense of i "the latter.' If there be any such rule as that alleged, perhaps Dr. Walker, who so authoritatively says you have violated it, will tell us whence it is derived. By the appeal vwich I }aave made to the prose of Dryden, to Bolingbroke, to Hume, and to Burke, I think I have very sufficiently ihown whence it is not derived, and have, moreover, thrown miuch doubt upon its existence, except as a theory of' certain ,raunmarians. -- I am, Sir, your obedient servant, .x. - Dec.

FORBIGN INTBLLIGBNCE. [A portion of the foUowing appeared in our second edito,, of ieatetdav - THE PARIS CONFERENCES. (BY SlUBMAlRIN AND BRITISH TLEGRAPH.) We have received the following telegraphic despatch from our Padis correspondent:- "PARIS, WEDxESDAY, Dxc. 31, 8.30 A.M. " The Monitezr announces that the Plenipotentiaries wil meet to-day in conference, at the Hotel of the Mfinister of Foreign Aff%ixs, to put an end to the difficulties which have obstructed the execution of the 20th Article of the Treaty of Paris."
FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN OORIB1SPONDENT.) PARI, TUISSAY, 6 P.m. A telegraphic despatch from Berne of yesterday's date announces the arrival of an "Envoy Extraordinary " from the Emperor Napoleon. It is probable that an attaco has been sent with despatches to the French Resident Minister, but I doubt muach whether any person to whom the designation, under present eireumstances, of "Envoy Extraordinary" can be applied has left Paris. As I have already stated, Colonel Barmann, the Swiss Minister, set out for Borne on Saturday evening last, after an interview wfith the Emperor, in which His Majesty expressed his desire to know the precise demands of Switzerland, and the utmost concessions the Federal Council would make to Prussia. When the Emperor is informed on this point he and the English Government will do their utmost towards a pacific solution of the difference. Another despateh of this day's date from Berme informs us that the National Council had, as I expected, unanimously adopted the proposition of the Federal Council, concerning the opening of an unlimited credit for the defence of the country. The General-in-Chief of the army was to be named by the Federal Assembly last night. The following extract of a letter from Vevey, Switzerland, will give some idea of the patriotic feeling which prevails in that country:- "The horizon is darkening over our country. The unjust aggression of Prussia cannot prevail in the end, for we have justiee in our favour, and Providence will protect us. We are quite calm and ready for the conflict. The northern frontier of our beloved country is now guarded by her children, and every man here is prepared, at the first beat of the drum, to proceed to tho point of danger. We shall leave behind us oar wives and children, and saerifice our fortunes in order to strike for liberty, wel convinced that our Heavenly Father wil guide our efforts in so holy a CaUse." The foUowing private telegraphic despatch has been received:- "IBERNE, DEc. 29, EvaIM-nc. "The Federal Assembly has not met to-day. "Councillor Furrer has been charged with a mission to the Courts of Southern Germany. "The American Minister at Berne has left for Berlin. "The steamers on the Lake of Constance have been armed, and al the ports situate on the lake have been put in a state of defence." The following letter on the employment of Swiss troops in the Neapolitan service is from the pen of M. Manin "The eyes of Earope are now directed towards Switzerland. It is a fine sight, that of a people preparing to defend their independence; secordingly, no honest man conceals his warm synpathies on the subject. They are manifested with such an accord, and with so much energy, that thiiy leave scareely any opportunity for the unfriendly insinuations of that ignoble part who abhor every generous feeling, and who are devoid of every noble sentiment. "In the midst of this concert of well-deserved praise, would it be becoming that a voice from the democratic party should teU some unpleasant trths to the Swis s? I have a long time hesitated, but, after mature reflection, I am persuaded that it wil render a service to demoeracy In general as well as to Switzerland itself. It is well that on the eve of battle the champion of nationality and of liberty should be invited to purify his conscience from all stain " It is weU that a voice whose sincerity cannot be doubted should tell the Swiss at this solemn moment ' Brothers, take care! It is not just that while you are defending liberty at home you should be the instruments of oppression abroad. See what the illustrious KossuQt gained by voting in the Hungarian Diet enormous s7bsidies of men and money to aid tho Emperor of Austria to reconquer the Lombardo-Venetian provinces-the insurgent students of Vienna marching to fight as volunteers against the insurgents of Italy-the patriots of the National Parliament of Frankfort declaring themselves hostile toItalian nationality -theFrench Republic employing its cannon and its hayonets, which might have liberated Europe, to replace the despotic Pontiff of Rome on his bloodsained throne; "In the affair of Neuchbteal, Switzerland claims from Prusia with calm and courageous dignity the indefeasible right which every nation possesses of giving itself the form of government best sudted to it. " At the same tinie the exercise of this right is prevented at Naples, particularly, aad above all, by a prntorian guard of from 12,000 to 15,000 Swiss. It is, in fact, eviden to the whole world that tyranny could not be maintained in Naples in a durable manner without the support of that prmtorian guard. " One can very well understand that generous souls should hasten voluntarily where the battles of liberty are fought Italy wil never forget that it was for justice against iniquity that in the years 1848 and 1849 the brave Swriss shed their blood at Vicenza and Venice. "' One can comprehend likewise to a certain point that volunteers may engage in foreign countries to serve as Soldiers in war time, particularly in countries which have not and cannot have a lrge standing army. " But the King of the Two Sicilies has a numerous national army, which he might easily increase if he wished, as the recrating system in force in his territories is similar to that of France. It is not to carry on war that he takes Swiss troops into his pay, but to maintain despotism in the country. They are not soldie,-rs he collects in the free Swiss mountains, but sdirrz. "One is certainly too severe on this poor King, who coascientiously ctrries on his trade of tyrant. A part, and a great part, of the reprobation should fall on the instruments he employs-on the vile mercenaries who sell their souLs for the service of tyranny. " What would public opinion throughout Europe say what would diplomacy itself say, if the Bourbon of Naples, in place of having a praetorian guard of 12,000 or 15,000 Swiss, had one of 12,000 or 15,000 Prussians? And yet it would be les odious to see despotism served by the subjects of a King than by the citizens of a Republic. "It is melancholy to be forced to assert that with respect to this scandalous traffic the moral sense of the Swiss nation, in other respects so honest and so noble; appears to be perverted and paralyzed. " When those mbrcenaries return home with the competence acquired at the price of blood-not of their blood, but of the blood and tears of the victims of the tyranny they have served-they enter into the full enjoyment of their civil and political rights, and they find among their fellowcitizens that regard and consideration aoccrded to those who have gained their fortune by honourable means. Public opinion in Switzerland stigmatizes not (as far as I know) one of the most dishonourable actions a man can commit. "Some laws have been enacted since 1849 with the apparent object of preventing' enrolment for foreign service. It would be very easy to prove that those laws are bad, awl badly executed. Ba' it belongs not to me to enter into these details. It is sufficient to mention the fact, that bere Se at Naples L2,000 or 15,000 satelites of despotism bearing the name of Swiss soldiers. So remarkable a fac8 provee the insufficiency of those laws, and could not exist without the uaterial or moral compheity of the nation itself. It is for the nation, therefore, to look to it, to render its legisltion effective, its magistrates vigilant and severe, its morals worthy of a free people. Its honoar is at stake. It cannot, it ought not, permit that the Swiss name should be longer stained with this disgrace. "I -will not speak of the old stipulations, which have now scarcely any importance. They exist at present only am regards two regiments, whoes effective strength is reduced one-half in consequenoe of the prohibition to enrol since 184). "Foe want of better reasons extenuating circumstanmes i*e$#hd. It is said, ' Whatwill you have of it ? It is a iijarity, and a particular eustom of our country. We d R~~ldlers much in the same way that Savoy supplies {I have reUay pro-ed that they are not soldiert, but uUini. Tho speciaity to supply abirri would be an infamous speeaity.

There is a very strong impression in many quarters entitled to deference that the king would freely relinquish his whole claims to the sovereigonty of Neuchate1, supposing the Swiss Federal Assembly were to resolve to set the prisoners free without trial, and the four Powers o Europe should collectively represent to himn the desirableness of Nenachatel's being brought into a purely federal relation- p to the Swiss G';overnment withoult the admixture of any foreign seigneuie. It is certainly not inconsistent with the King's character to take this COuse, andno course can be so utterly lamentable for all parties as a recurrence to arms in this matter. The resaumption of the exercise of sovereignty in Neuchbtel, the separation of it from the Federal Government, and itseonversion into a Prussian principality, or a disorace happening to the Prussian arms in Switzerland, are all evils and injuries to Prussia that differ only in intensity. It is difficult only to decide which would be worst, success or defeat. Without an infraction of the terms on which the relationship has always heretofore existed between the King and the Prineipality he could not maintain any standing armed force there, either Swiss or Prussi, and yet one will henceforth be necessary if the sovereignty is to be enforced there. If the present federal relationmhip to the Swiss Government is to cease the Prince of Neuchdtel must provide for the defence of the land, exposed to easy attack and at a distance from his own resources. The recovery of Neuch-tel would add two fresh'sources of weakness to Prussia -the necessity of defending a weak and distant dependency, and of being deferential to France, which can at any time take it. The approaching jubilee of the Prince of Prussia's 50th anniversary of his entering the army will not be of a natureto allay any excitement of the military spirit of the Prussian army. Where so many picked officers and men come toaether to compliment the Prince on his military quaities, and sword, shield, and helmet are handed him with a vast accompaniment of rattling sabres and clanldng spurs, it will be difficult to avoid saying something or other that may act as the spark to the powder or the flame to tle gas. The Prince and Princess of Prussia, together with Prince Friedrich Wilheon, are expected to arrive here to-morrow evening, to be ready for the ceremonies awaiting the Prinee on Thursday, Jan. 1, the 50th anniversary of his entering the army. On the followirg day are expected the Grand Duke and Duchess of Baden, the Prince's daughter and sonin-law, the Grand Duke Michael of Russia (who is about to marry a sister of the Grand Duke of Baden, and who is at the same time interested in the ceremony, as being chef of the 4th Regiment of Prussian Hussars), the GrandDuke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the Duke of Brunswick, and Duke Ernest of SaxeCoburg. Sir Colin Campbell, who is to bring over the insignia of the Order of the Bath, and present them to the Prince next Thursday in the name of Queen Victoria, has not arrived to-day at the apartments taken for him at the Royal Hotel, where he is hourly expected. His non-arrival excites the more iuterest and anxiety, as his departure from England for this place has been known here these two days. SWITZERLAND. TE FEDERAl MESSAGE. In the second part of the federal message of the 26th December (we published a summary of the first part yesterday) the Federal Council says - " Before mentioning our reply to the French note of the 26th November, we must make you acquainted with an extract from a despatch addressed on the 25th November by Lord Clarendon to the English Minister at Berne, and which will prove to you more positively still that the English Government thought fit to assume an attituade which is essentially different from that of the French Government. " The English Envoy was instructed to inform the President of the Confederation that Her Majesty'e Government, however great was its desire to contribute by every means in its power towardsprocurlng an amicable settlement of the NeuchAtel question, did not think it right, nevertheless, to acquiesce in the bases of negotiations that had been proposed at Paris, because those bases appear to imply a know. ledge of the intentions of the King of Prussia not possessed by Her Majesty's Government, and this circumspection in the decision of Her Maesty's Government Is dictated by the motive that Switzerland appears to suppose that the King of Prussia would renounce bis rights on Neucbaltel In case the prisoners should be amnested. Ifthe Government of Her Majesty had contributed to provoke similar deductions on the part of the Federal Council, it would have done a thing it was not authorized to do, as it has not received from the Prussian Government any communication to justify such deductions, and is completely ignorant of the futuee intentions of the King of Prussia The Go. vernment of Her Britannic Majesty is far from wishing to affirm that the liberation of the prisoners might not simplify the solution of this affair, and that the King of Prussia would not be bound to satisfy the wishes of the Federal Government; but, on the other hand, Her Majesty's Government cannot take any engagement or give any assurance that this is really the case, Should, however, the Federal Government, on considering the circumstances, suddenly decide upon liberating the prisoners without a trial, the Government of Her Majesty, in common accord with the French Government, would take steps to induce the King of Prussia to put an end to the Neuch&tel dispute according to the desire of the Swiss Confederation, and to recognize the independence of the canton of NeuchAtel. Nevertheless, Her MajestWs Govern- ment feels it its duty to declare, as well to the ConfederationI as to the Federal Government, that it cannot guarantee the success of its measures, and that it has not as yet any ground to form an aesurance as regards the reslt of its good offices, As regards the propojition of the Federal Council that, in case of a refusal on the part of the King of Prussia to accept this arrangement; the British Government should withdraw its adhesion to the London Protocol, Her Majestys Government cannot yet give a reply, and the Federal Government must co*sider that the Protocol is binding upon the Powers that signed it," The maessage then states that it s~ent_ a~ negative reply to the ffrench note of the 26th of November. This reply was dated December 6. In this .despatch the Federal Council upholds the right of the. C6nfederation, and ex:presses its doubts as to the real intentionS of the King of .Prussa, even shoud the prisoners be liberated: "Greater confidence (it says) in the Kings assurance3 eould only be acquired if the Emperor of the Fench were informed of the conditions which theEing intended to make, and if the Emperor could declare that those conditions are in no mannner incompatible with the complete independence of NeuchAtel." On the 10th of December the Federal Council took' another step. It instructed the Swiss Ep"'iw at Paris to communicate confidentlialy to the Pru sian Abamador that the Swiss Government weW willing to enter into direct negotiations, the object of which would be the reoDgition of the Independence of Neucb&teL If the King felt inclined to listen to overtures in that sense in came HU Majesty should desire it, a pecial delegate would be serqt to negotiate the matter. On the 14th December the Swis Minister at -Paris informed his GOverment tat the Prusslan Ambassador ad declardf to him that it was aot in hia power to take a communiation from the Swims euvo,y, but ihat he wouldmake private inquhies t Berln to wce if there was any Inclination to take advantage of the delayIn the trials toegotate si arrangement. Count Hatzfeldt mnads no futther communication, but the Swiss envoy was- in-- formed by the Minister- of another Power that a Swiss delegate would be received at Berlin, but only after the liberation of the -pnrisoners. Matters remained thus till the 16th of December, when L. de Sydow, the Prussian Envoy in Switzerland, announced that he had been ordered by his Sovereign to break off diplomatic relations with Switzerland. Under these circumstances the Federal Governraent found it advisable to prepare for all eventualities. [The message here enters at length into the steps of preparation, &c.] "The Swiss people," continues the message, "Understand thatthe hourof irialIs at hand ; they calmly &wait its arrival without provocation, and ia this dignified attitude we behold a t.ruly imposing manifestation. The Swiss people recognize their providential destination; ther know their liberty is at stake, theirright to a free Con. stitution, perhaps their existence, and to guard thes, precious rights to defend the inheritance of their ancestors they are ready to make every sacrifice upon the altar o their country." On the 20th December all the Ministers resident at Berne made formal proposals, with a view to prevent a conflict. They were to the effect that if the Federal authorities would, In virtue of their sovereignty, give up the trial of the prisoners, their -respective Governmnents would exert themselves to Induce the Kling of Prussia to come to anl arrangcmlent in the sense of the absolute independence of Neuchitel from all foreign bonds. Considering that all the Powers thus recognized the rights of sovereignty of Switzerland, and that their Joint action was likely to produce the desired result-regarding it, also, as a favourable circumstance that the Legation of the United States had declared its readiness to join these collective assurances, the Federal Council declared in consequence that it was dispowd to propose to the Federal Assembly to decree, in virtue of the sovereignty of the Swiss Confederation, as follows - " 1. The proceedings for an attempt at insurrection at Neuchfitel on the 23d of September of the present year are stopped. " 2. The prisoners are set at liberty; but (in the interest of public order) they must not leave the canton until a final arrangement respecting Neuchatel has been made." This also fell to the ground, because some of the Powers refased to acquiesce in the collective note on the subject. After stating that the Federal Council has taken the neceesary steps for financial measures, the mes- age says:- " We have now given a fair account of all the negotia. tions. You sea the face of the matter remains unchanged. Prussa demands the preliminary and unconditional libera. tion of the prisoners; we, on our aide, declare ourselves tl wnlling to abandon the tria, provided the independence of ITeuchftel is declared at the same time, or that at least guarantees aroe Sen to us that it will be so. We must not and cannot relinquish this condition without compromis. ing the right of a fee conshttution and the sovereign rights of the Confederation. We confidently leave to you the appreciation of our conduct, certain that Impartial nistory will one day render us justice." Here follow the last decrees of the Federal Assmbly, viz. :- "1. The Federal Council will still continue to endeavour, as hitherto, to procure a acific solution of the Neuchatel uestion by every means compatible withthe honour and dignity of Swvitzerland, and which wre of a nature to procure the recognition of the indepeendence of Neucbt&tel from all foreign ties. "2. The military levies ordered by the Feder4 Council, and the other measures of safety taken by it, are approved. " It is authorized to take any ulterior measures deemed neeessary to defend the country to the last extremity, in case an honourable and pacific solution cannot be obtained. "An rnlinited credit is alowed to meet all expenses. "3.

The Federal Council is charged to communicate these proposibions through the proper channels to the people of the Sw eantons. WPhen adopted the Commander-in. Chief will bonamed.

RORSE GUARDS PATRONAGE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Allow me to make one more attempt-to render myself intelligible to " A LieutenantGeneraL" He is perfectly correct in stating that the 50th paraoraph of the report of 1854 relates to proniotionby selection for dtinguished services, and no; to the distribution of regiments to general officers, nor have I stated the contrary. But in my first letter to you I quoted te entire passage, of which " A Lieutenant-General" quotes but the first two lines; and the part which he has omitted contains the pith of the paragraph. The Commissionern of 18M4, having arrived at the conclusion that selection must necessarily be rbsorted to in order to obtain for the public service general officers in the vigour of their age, which the purchase system had failed to provide, admitted that it would be most necessry to enact new and 3tringent regulations In order to neutralize Lhat fcatal tendency to favouritim which has of late years pervaded our military administration. They therefore recommended that whenever an officer was selected for promotion the services which hat entitled him to that advantage should be publicly detailed. They intimated that their object in maldng thais suggeston was, that " public opinion" should watch these transactions "jealously and vigilantly," so that the general interests of the army and the public might be thus guarded against family and political influence. I quoted this passage to show that the militaty men and statesmen who composed the Royal Commissior of 1854 were of opinion that the vigilance and attention of the public were the only real safeguards against favouritism and jobbing in the apportionment of military promotion and reward-, and I conceive that I was perfectly justified in doing so. "ALieutenant-General"asksmewhyIhaveselected this one especal case for comment. I will tell him. Because this case is the first of the kind which has occurred under the new regime at the Horse Guards, from which the nation expects so much. He further says that, " as General Anson stood next for a regiment, he has yet to learn why he should have been passed over." This observation implies that the possession of a regiment is a matter of seniority and not a reward of merit, as likely to be attained by long service in the pleasant clubs of London and on the grassy plains of Newmarket and Bpsom as by distinguished gallantry and patient endurance in bloody battles and sickly climes abroad. B3ut when I examine the report of the Commi - sion of 1840, over wvhich the l)ie of -Wellington presided, I there fmnd these very colonelcies of reg:ments described as "'rewards for distinouisl?ed gervice." And Lord Fitzroy Somerset0 states in his evidence before that commission that in his opinion, officers who have had the good fortune to distinguish themselves in the field ought to have the first claim to such rewards; that officer's who have served long and well in the colonies and in India ought to have the nest claim; and that stay-at-home soldiers ought to be served last of all. (Questions 1734-7.) Suchias been the theory of the H3orse Guards, and an admira'e theory it is. But, unhappily, their practice has hitherto been of an entirely opposite nature, as a very superficial examination of the Amnry List will readily show. 1 am, Sir, your obedient servant. .

-HISTORIAL- AND POLITICAL DISSER- TATIONS.% Lord Brougham has been beyond all question one of the honmes aarqtuans of his age. Endowed with a vast and restless intellect, he has sought to imitate his celebrated predecessor on the woolsack, who " took all knowledge for his province ;" while the impetuous energy of his disposition, stimulated and directed by an enlightened philanthropy, has preventedhis fondness for speculative disquisition from interfering with more practical objects, and has enabled him to connect his name imperishably with some of the most important measures of his time, and to stamp them with the impress of his own strong will and of his large, masculine, and benevolent understanding. From his entrance into public life, an ardent enemy alike of the oppression that crushes the body and of the prejudice and ignorance that would chain the mind, he has lent his eager aid to unclasp the fetters of the slave, to simplify and h-manize the law. Of the sacred cause of educationi he has ever been the leading champion ; and, without pledging ourselves to the approval of all his theories onthe subject, we must admit that the extent to which the schoolmaster is now abroad and the degree in which the desire both to impart and to receive knowledge has pervaded all ranks of society are very mainly owing to his strenuous and generally well-directed exertions. No inappropriate finish to so diligent and useful a life is the task which Lord Brougham has undertaken of editing a collected series of his literary works, of which the Historical and Political Dissertations before us form not the least important volume. They are the work of different, indeed of widely distinct periods of their author's life, some bearing a date within the last seven or eight years. while others were written at the beginning of the century, above 50 years ago; but, unfortunately, they are not arranged in chronological order, which, while it is desirable probably in all publications of the same writer, is especially so when, as in the present case, many of the essays are on subjects so similar as often to lead to a reconsideration, or at least to a renewed mention, of the same topic, and their perusal in the same order in whieh they were written shows us in an instructive manner the gradual imDrovement of style and thought in a great writer and thinker, the progress from the lively and somewhat authoritative diction of the youthful essayist to the more cautious tone and chastened eloquence of the praetised orator, and the still more important advance from the acuteness and shrewdness of the student to the experienced and sober wisdom of the legislator and the statesman. There is great danger of this being lost sight of by the present want of arrangement; and not only is a valuable lesson thus lost, but the reader is almost inevitably led to form an idea of the writer's opinions exactly the reverse of the correct one-for Instance, at page 128 we are told that France and England " are' naturally friends and allies from similarity of constitution, unity of interests, anda position which enables them to maintain the peace of the world, as it enables them to defy the world in arms ;" but at page 202 we are told " that it is quite impossible to have too much jealousy of France," and every one must look upon this latter sentence as to a great extent a recantation of the former except the reader who keeps looking to the end of each essay for its date, and who thus perceives that it is the first passage which is a retractatMon of the second, the first having been written in 1843, while the second was published 34 years before, when the feelings of jealousy (and something more) against France were kept constantly alive by the most formidable war in which either nation had ever been engag,ed. In such a number of essays of so discursive a chara-ter, professedly discussing the whole foreign policy, and many most important points of the domestic polcy of the nation, and illustrating the views maintained by occasional references to the history of almost every country under the sun for above two thousand years, and to writers of nearly every period and every language, it would be impossible for all the statements or opinions advanced to command universal assent; but, all things considered, the points on which we venture to differ from Lord Brougham are very few, and not usually such as greatly affect his main argument, or the object at which he aimed in delivering his sentiments to his fellow-countrymen. We will specify one or two instances in which he has, as we conceive, taken an erroneous view of historical facts. At page 94 we are told that- "Louis had in 1710 renewed his offer of giving up his grandson, and placing the crown of Spain and the Indies upon the head of a German prince." And the English Govermnent is severely reproved for its folly in refusing terms then which it X could not obtain two years later at UTtrecht, after new and great successes had been ,ained." We are certainly not so Quixotic as to be inclined to break a lance in defence of the concluders of the peace of lUtrecht; but we do not believe that Louis was sincere in his offer to abandon Philip; and it was the belief that he was not that caused the dissolution of the Conferences at Gertruydenberg, to which allusion is here made. Coxe's account is, that | "They (the aUies) were wel aware that he was seoretly encouraging his grandson to persevere, and, as he objected to deliver up such fortresses as the allies required, the most strenuous advocates for peace began to suspect his sincerity."j- Lord Mahon sayst - ". A small circumstance which occurred at VersaiUes at the same time showed more plainly how far the pzomised dethronement of Philip was from the thoughts of Louis. He gave the ducal title of Anjou to the infant son of the Duke of Burgundy, afterwards Louis XV., although that very title must have been borne by Phihip, in Fance, had the preliminaries been complied with. . . . On the whole, the more closely we look at the details of these transactions the more plain and glaring becomes the Insincerity of Louis, and the more we must feel surprise that even the very extremity of party spirit should have formerly raised up in England'advocates of his honour and integrity. But in the preEent century, when there is no longer any such faotious interest to serve, it wll scarcely be denied that, though Louis was at that t,ime sincerely desirous of peace, he would agree to none that did not leave him some means of afterwards evading its unfavourable terms." And, though the French historians do not coincide in this view, it is difficult to suppose that Louis could have had a serious purpose in conferences for which he not only furnished his ambassadors with no instructions, seeing one of them for only a quarter of an hour, and the other not at all, but to which he actually sent them, to use the expression of St. Simon, in masquerade; the Marewchal d'Huxelles being forbidden to display his truncheon, or to wear his orders or any other badges of his rank; and the Abb4 de Polignac being compelled to give no smal scandal to his clerical brethren by discarding his ecclesiastical vestments, and appearing as long as the conferences lated dressed in all points en cavaUe,-. Again, at page 43, it is mentioned as notorious that we assi4ted oPiusia in the Seven Yeas War, " in consequence of France siding against Frederic I1.," but the real fact appears rather to have been that France declared agains Prussia because we had become the ly of that:Power. ll'o doubt the reianmino niitress in France, Madame de Pompadour, haa -been influenced by the strange and unbecoming condescension with which that most virtuous of ma- * + - eof M 7, p. .I . : Wu.ofeo e. . ... 29.. trons and proudest of Queenss, MIaria Teresa, iad written her letters which her early education had scarcely qualfied her to read, calling her " Princess," * Cousin," and "Her dear Sister ;" and even more by the scornful allusions to her which Frederic took every opportunity of making, gving her name to ono of his dogs, and constantly desiring his courtiers to remark the superiority, in economy and modesty of his Pompadour over that of his brother Louis. But, profligate as the French Court was, the minister3 verenot inclined to encounter the emity of him who was then the most formidable of EuroneanSovereigns, merely to gratify her; on the contrary, hearing that negotiations between Prussia and England were going on, they sent the Duc de Nivernois to Berlin to remonstrate against Frederic's allying himself with their enemy; but the treaty with Englandwas already signed; an& it was not till some months after Frederic had actually shown it to the Duke that one was finally concluded between France and Austria. To an Englishman, however, the question of the seizure of the Danish fleet is one of more consequence, as the character of his country is materially affected by 'he degree in which that most vigorous measure of compulsion adopted against a State with which we were not at war was justifiable. Lord Brougham admits (page 85) that it was clearly proper if " we had proof, both thakt the danger was great and that it was imminent ;" but he insists that- "Although there vas every reason to believe that Napoleon designed to subdne the Dane and seize his fleet, and that he must have succeeded in his invasion, there was no imm ediate prospect of his making the attempt, fall as his handsthen were, and only just having made peace with Russia-a peace which an aggression upon )enmark must at once have broken. It seems clear that we were bound to wait until he should begin to make preparations for the apprehended expedition." Now, we object to every part of Lord Brougham's arguments-first, on the ground of policy, because to us it is clear that, if " we had every reason to believe that Napoleon designed to seize the Danes' fleet, and that he must have succeeded" in hisdesign, and if it was necessary for us to anticipate him, it would have been the very extremity of folly to wait til his plans were so fully matured that he had begun to make preparations for carrying them into effect. We could not be sure of knowing when he began to make these preparations; still less could we be sure that it might not then be too late to frustrate them. Delays are proverbially dangerous; but never so much so as when dealing with an enemy of such unrivaUed energy and proraptitude as the French Emperor. Secondly, we demur to the reason alleged for thinking that the attempt would not be made immediately-namely, that an aggressionupon Denmark would have broken the peace with Russia, for it was in concert with Russia that the plan had been formed and that the aggression upon Denmark was to be made. nd, thirdly, we maintain as a fact, that the Government had the most complete poesible evidence that the danger was not only "great," but "inminent," and circumstances universally notorious showed that it was even more imminent than our Ministers had supposed. In a question that tunms upon the imminence of a danger dates are of the utmost importance. It was on the 25th of June, 1807, that Napoleon and Alexander met on the raft on the Niemen, and a very few days saw the conclusion of the treaties of 1ilsit, both public and secret. The publc treaties were, of couse, proclaimed at once to the world; and the means of information possessed at the time by our Mfinisters put them equally in possession of the secret conventions which had been agreed upon, one of the articles of which was that, if by the 1st of December England had not given a satisfactory answer to demands which it was intended that Russia should male, the Russian Ambassador should leave London, and " France and Russia should jointly summnon the three Courts of Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Lisbon to close their harbours against English vessels, recall their ambassadors from London, and declare war a,gainst Great Britain." A danger distant only four months was s.urely imminent enoug,h; but, in point of fact, NTapoleon's impatience for the deveilopment of his design,s against Eng-land was too great to alow him to wait till the appointed day, and it was soon shown that if our Ministers had exerted one atom less promptitude than they did exert they would have been too late. The instant that they received intelligence of the secret treaty they began to equip a fleet to counteract its object; but it was the 16th of August before it arrived off Copenhagen, and four days beforethat the French Ambassador at that city had been instructed to demand the instant co-operation of the Danish fleet. On that same 16th of Augffust Napoleon himuself publicly demanded of the Dansh Ambassador at Paris whether his Court had obeyed the orders sent to them, to shut their ports against the British flag, to confiscate the property of British subjects, and to join their fleet to the maritime confederacy against England.* How, then, can it be denied either that the British Government had sufficient evidence tojustify their act, or that that evidence was proved by the facts to be in all respects trustworthy; or that there was anything in the relations of Russia with France to invalidate it, oreven to raise the slightest suspicion of its accmaracy, and of the imminence of the danger; or that the case was not so urgent as to forbid one moment's delay ? On all these points we do believe the justification of our Ministers to be impregnable; and for these reasons we look upon their act as one of singularly wise, statesmanlike, and patriotic energy. Every one must agree that it is scarcely possible to over-estimate the brilliancy of Napoleon's military talents; but when Lord Brougham asserts (page 119) that the "' terror of his name prevailed," so that "the dread of advancing among the French people smote even the hearts of their conquerors; all seemed unmanned; and at Chatillon all, even the representatives of En-land included, were desirous of making a peace which should fix Napoleon upon his throne," he certainly does injustice to the Minister who was the mouthpiece of England at that important congress, and who, however he may have differed from him, and however mistaken he may still think him on other points, he must at least admit never to have been deficient in courage and resolution. His allies, indeed, did waver, and it was his firmness that decided, we might almost say compelled, them to continue their onw ard march to Paris. Nor, perplexed as he was by the mutual distrust of Austria and Russia and by the apathy of the French people, is there the least trace to be found in all his despatehes of any desire to establish the permanency of his throne, though he was, no doubt, clear that there was no alternative between him and the Bourbons, and resolved to discountenance any project for dividing France among the different military chiefs who began to speculate upon their own advancement.t But of aU passages referring to past history the most singular is one at the beginning of the first essay, which,if it were not, as one may say, endorsed by the noble author's republishing it now without comment, we should have been inelined to p over' as the production of a very young man led by a taste for antithesis and contrast to pen a sentence without a due consideration of its meaning. At page 5 we read, in reference to the eighteenth century:- *Had it not been for that wholesome jealousy of rival neighbours which modern politicians have learned to herish, how many conquests and changes of dominion wouldhavetakenpla, instead of ws, in which some lives were lost, not perhap4 the most valuable in the community, anda some superfluouls millions were squandered! How maany fair portions of the globe ght have been deluged in blood, mstead of some hundreds of sailors fight- ing harmlessy on the barren plains of the ocean, and some thousands of soldiers ing on a scientific, and regular, and quiet system of wafare in countries set apart for the purpose, and resorted to as the arena where the disutes of nations might be determined." WhatLordBrougham mayconsider "harmless" we cannot, of course, presume to define; we, ourselves, should have affixed a very different epithet to the terrible and bloody engagements with which the whole history of the century is filled, from the day -when Rooke and Ormond forced their entrance into I Vigo Bay, and, -as the n-oble historian of the war I relates, "war had seldom assumed so hideous an aspect," to that when L'Orient blew up in the Bay of Aboukir with an effect tremendous as to give a momentary respite even 3 the hatred of hostile nations and the fy of reeking combatants. What he nay consider "a quiet system of warfare," and what would present to his minda picture of fair portions of the globe deluged in blood, we are equally ignorant.; but remembering Bilenhein and lplaquet anud Pultowa at the beginningof the century, and Kolin nd Leand Rosbach in the middle, and Ijael and Novi ad lodi at the end, .we feel that we cannot realize the same idea that they present to his apprehension ; and to usit does * Debate on the transaction, quoted by Alison, c1p. 51, VW. 39. * t See Datpktcea of Lord,Cc;;ereagoi, Series III., voL L, i especisULvthe letters p. 212, and ma26. 1 I appear £hat Peter and Frederic and Catliie (tosay nothing of ourselves, since our acquisitions were i made in other quarters of the globe) made impor- tant conquests and acqnisition9- of territory, which is only another name for changes of dominion; that the partition of Poland was one of the most comnplete changes of dominion that the history of the worl7d presents, and that (since rebellion did not spare even our own island) there was not one country in Enrope, from the Baltic to Gibaltar, from the mouth of the D)on to the Highlands, that did not inthe courseof the century flowith theningled blood of its natives and of its invaders But these inaccuracies, arising, probably, from that emlbarras des richcsses which sometes perplexes and misleads the most fertile intellect, diminish bat little the general value of the volume before us, which arises from the shrewdness with which general principles of policy are discussed, the acuteness of observation with which the past is commented on that it may serve as a guide to the future, the practical nature of the views racommended for our adoption, and the enlightened humanity to which all these excellencies are subordinate. In another rect, lso, a valuable lesson may be derived by aut vrs of the present age, if they will study as a model the pregnant brevity with which the noble author iJiustratte his arguments, and enforces his conclusiois, and often places a summary of events, or the resplt of a series of actions, before the reader with more 'igour and greater clearness in a few words thasi others could effect by a long and laboured exposition. We do not remember to have seen anywhere a more perfect example of compression without cosfusion, and of generaLlization without indistinctness, than is affiorded by the sketch of the steps bywvhich " our excellent constitultionwas ilowlyformed" at page 293. The conduct and fate of Ru8ssa at the beginning of Thiis century are told in two lines, which, sO prone is history to repeat itself, one might fancy referred to the events of the last two years. "Russia, in an evil hour, began to move, ceased to be ivincible, and lost her sway in Europe." (p. 104) Nor is this the only instance in which the events of the last few Years recal those of earlier days as mentioned by Lord Brougham, and prove the general soundness of his observations. The sieae of Sebastopol has afforded a practical proof of tihe truth of the statement that " the transport of an amy by sea is often more easy than the march over a considerable tract of land," for it was far easier for us to send reinforcements and supplies to our army than the Emperor of Russia found it to convey the-m to his own, though the ground to be traversed lay wholly within his own territory. The grounds of the late war are atated with such precision on page 76 that they need hardly have been put in other language if intended to apply to that event alone "l the injustice committed, or threatened, be very glaring; above all, if it consstinconquestand in augmentug the power of the aggressor, it may be considered that the whole civilized world is interested in checing and unishing such outrages, and that nations so far removed om the neighbourhood of those acting and smffering resectively as not to be immediately affected, and not even to nave any ground for dreading the consequences of the WrOng conmmitted, are really iterested indirectly, because whatever wreakens the security of one country and encourages another in its attackas tends to lessen the general reprobation of injustice, andgivesenoouragementto nupers and invaders al over the civilized world.' The belief in the mutual antipathy of France and England, and in the certainty that they would not both take the same side, which induced Frederic to undertake the Seven Years War (see Pa&p.e 44), undoubtedly also encouraged the Emper5r kicholas to prosecute his designs against Turkey; but the example on which he relied deceived him, because he did not take into account, and perhaps was incapableof appreciating, the degree in which the French have arrived at a more accurate perception of their own interests since that time, and the power which they now have of giving utterance to that perception, but of which in the middle of the last century they had long been wholly deprived. In one instance, and one alone, as far as we have observed, have the general principles laid dovn in these dissertations been falsified by recent events. In comparing the respective advantages and disad vantages of absolute and popular Govermments i is laid down that ":Royal matches, personal quar rels, family interests, may cautse the peace to b, broken under absolute monarchies, while no suc] disaster can arise under popular Governments" (pag. 92). Yet the writer would certainly have called th Government of Louis Philippe a popular Govern ment; and during the whole of his reign the peac of Europe was never so much endangered as by th Spanish match, which had very nearly kindled th flames of a general war, and which, in the belief c many, not unfavourable judges of his general police or character, had some share in producing the dis contents which at no distant period drove him fron his throne. Besides the general principles of foreign polic; which it is the direct objects of those essays tha we have selected for our chief consideration in thi article to inculcate, they are also, as might b expected from the discursive character of Lori Brougham's mind and the vast extent of his multi farious information, interspersed with incidentE remarks w.-hich, though often rather digression from than illustrations of his argument, and thong sometimes in danger of escaping notice from thei brevity, deserve careful attention. The remark o theweakness of the South American Republic arising from their "having been founded befox the pcople had learnt the difficult and late acquwre lesson of self-governtment" (p. 143), and of t] success of the American Constitution, be ause it w not founded till the.people had learnt the habit applying themselves to political affairs, and h. arrived at an adequate comprehension of represent tive goverment (P. 109), may suggest to politic theorists that in all political questions there is som thing more to be considered than the abstra justifiableness or excellence of a measure-namel the even more important point of how far it suited to the people for whom it is intended, ho they are inclined to receive, or how far they a qualified to appreciate it; and whether the exic ing moment is not only a fit, but the fittest possib time for its application. Again, while those to whom the power a£ aggressive spirit of Russia afford a continm source of alarm may derive comfort from t; reasons, not the less convincing for being stated the brief compass of half a page (page 146), whih have led the noble author to conclude that no ve, serious apprehension need be entertained of £ attack ever being -made by that country upon tl Northern provinces of our Indian empire our rule of that empire may also learn that the best defencef those enormous possessions is to be found, not. their fortresses or walled towns, their brave Sepoy or their invincible European troops, but " in tl justice and lenity of our administration," which I the exhibition of such a spirit shallI " avoid all coD sion with the natives," and in restraining as far: possible the inclination to grasp at further additiox to o territory ad revenue, which, though almoa each successive acquisition has really seemed force upon us by the priciple of self-defence, has give a handle to those whose favourite topic is the amb tion and covetousness of England, and ahich ea certainly be only completely justified by ou government of the annexed provinces being carrie out vith such liberality and wisdom that the COI dition of our new subjects shall be benefitted by th Ichange of masters. !One proposition advanced in his first dissertation dated in 1803, mus.t have sounded strngely in th. ears of those to wrhom it wasaddressed, who looke( on Nelson and his invincible fleet as the sures bulwark of their seagirt home. They were tok that- " The elements may, by retainig the British Ileets ir Plymoouth or Portsmouth, while they waft the enemy'" squadrons from Brest or the Texel, destroy a moment that bulwark to which we vWinly intrusthe national defene, and render utterly useless the whole natural force (as it is termed)of the countr ,wlhich,afterachangeo?

To say that En laR' m y trust to he fleets, then, is to recommend a fulffseince upon the chance of a single battle, or the event of a sea.chase; to inculcats a silly confidence in good fortune, and to advise that thefate of Great Britain should be committed to the cbanges of the elements, the shifting of a wind, or the settling of a It is to her armiesthat eveUr ston, lnsular or continen, M-ust look forher sure and natur.alefence."-p. 15.

Sir,-As the re-assembling of Parliament wiU soon take place, or, in other words, the " busy season" of your valuable journal wil shortly commence, may I ask you, in this your interval of comparative leisure. to kindly allow me to make you the medium of a few observations on the same subject as referred to in my letters of feur years back, which you, with your usual liberality of spirit, published in your columns. Not only is the " busy season" of The Tines coming round again, but also that of the milliners and dressmakers, when many more "slaves of the needle" will follow in the same sad path that hundreds of their sisters in suffering have gone, unless something is done immediately to prevent it. As an individual, it is but little that I can personally do against so large a class of opponents, except by giving pablicity to my own experience of cases almost daily brought to my notice. But such amalgamation as that of the Early Closing Association and the Dressmakers' Institution in Clifford-street can, and will eventually, do much. Theirlast meeting, however, at Exeter-hail was a great mistake, inasmuch as it ought to have been held before, instead of after the season. But such an error, I am glad to find, wil not occur again. But, while Mr. Iilwall and his coUeagues are arranging their humane course of action, allow me to recall a suggestion I made in the year 1853, and which would be a very material assistance. It is simply this :-Fashionable miliners and dressmakers are, of course, wholy supported by the ladies of the fashionable world, without whose patronage they could not continue their business. These very ladies, then, who have so much power in their own hands, should pledge themselves to withdraw their patronage from all houses that would not fall into the 12-hour systemthis fact to be ascertained, not from the employer, but by a letter, or form, signed by aU the young people, and forwarded (say, nionthly), either to the Early Closing or Dressmakers' Association. The form might run thus " To the Committee of, &c. " Gentlemen,-We have much pleasure in informing you that our duties during the past month have not exceeded 12 hours per day. *'We are, &-c." If the ladies of our aristocracy would, as a body, take up the subject thus, the evil must give way. The applications I constantly have from young people leaving these " workhouses," and the harrowing tales I hear from them are distressing in the extreme. Two days since one presented herself in a state of fearful distress, begging me to give her employment. She had lately been dismissed her situation, because suffering severely in health, she refused to work after 10 p.m.; she sought employment elsewhere, and was engaged, provided her reference suited; but when, in answer to- the usual inquiry, "What was her reason for leaving?" the answer was, "Because she refused to work our hours," the ufortunate girl's doom was at once sealed; nor would her employer give her a second reference. Thus was she left to wander the streets almost houseless, and, after her scanty purse was exhausted, quite hungry. The only consolation I could give her was my mite to buy her a meaL. And I have almost daily similar distressing a pAcations for employment. Pray, then, again use your al-powerful pen to help in rooting out such an evil, and the blessing of thousands will follow you. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, - . . . _ JdA!NA D. LE PLARTRTWT? zona-street, Dec. 3o.
TE NEW MAIuRAGE AcTS.-To-day (Thursday) two aots of Parliament, which received the royal assent on the 29th of July, will take effect. The first (the 19th aud 20th of Victoria, chap. 119) isi to amsend the provisions of the Marriage and begistration Acts, and the other is to amend the law of marriage in Scotland. The recited acts in the first mentioned statute are the 6th and 7th of William IV., chap. 85; the Is of Victoria, chap. 22; and the 3d and 4th of Viotoria, chap. 72. It iLs now provided that no notice of a marriage is to he read or published before the Poor Law guardians, or to be transmitted to the clerk of the guardians. Every notice of narriage is to be accompanied by a solemn declaration by one of the parties that there i no lawful hindrance to such marriage, and persons making wilfully false declayrations are to suffer the fenalties of perjury. aotice of a marriage without a license -is to be affsxed in the superintendent registrar's-office butx nio notice of a marriage with license is to be suspendeda in the office. In case of marriage by license notice is to be to the superintendent registrar of one district. in marr notice is to be given of a marriage without licenses, if one of the partiesn reside there, and in Scotland a certificate of sroclamation of bans in Scotland as to a party reaiding there is to be equivalent to a asuprintendentr-egistrar's certificate. In cases of marrge y license a certificate of the notice thereof may be given to the superintendent-registrar (unless the mnarriage be forbidden), wnd thereupon the marriage is to be solemnized. There iA a provision to the effect that, if persons are desirous, they may add the religions cereiony of the church or persuasion to which they belong, but no religions service is to be used at the registy-office where the marriage is solemnized. In case of a fraudulent marriage the guilty party is to forfeit all property accrued from the marriage, as in the 4th of George IV., chap. 76. Mfarriages of Quakers and Jews may now he solemnized by license, and the registrar-general is to furnish a register, books, and forms to each certified secretary of a synagogue of British Jews. The registrar-general is to allow searches, &o,as to certifiea places of worship. The other statute contains only three sections, and is to prevent Gretna-green and border marriages. It will come inLto force this day, as it is declared that after the 3slt of December no irregujar marriage contracted in Scotland by declaration, acknowledgmaent, or ceremony is to be -valid unless one of the parties has resided or lived 21 days in Scotland, IIany law, custom, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding."
METfROPOLITAY DDAINAG.E. The following is a copy of the letter addressed to Captain l)ouglaa Galton, R.E. James Simpson, Esq., C).E., and James E. Blaok vell Esq., C.E., to whom Sir Benjamin HIall has referred the plan for the main drainage of the metropolis, which was submitted to him on the 22d ult. by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works " Office of Works, &c., Whitehall, Dec. 3L "Gentlemen,-I am directed by the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works, &c., to forward for your consideration the plans for the main drainage of the metropolis wbich have been submitted to me for approval by the Metropolitan Board of Works, in accordance with the 18th and loth of Victoria, cap. 120, ss. 135 and 136. By the first of these sections it is provided that the Mfetropolitan Board of Works 'shall make such sewers amd works as they may think necessary for preventing all or any parb of the sewage within the metropolis from flowing or passing into the river Thames in or near to the metropolis, and shall cause such sewers and works to be completed on or before the 31st day of December, 1860, and shall also make all such other sewers and works, and such diversions or alterations of any existing sewvers or works, vested in them under this act, as they may from time to time think necessary for the effectual sewerage and drainage of the metropolis; and shall discontinue, close up, or destroy such sewers for the time being vested in them under this act as they may deem unnecessary, and sich board shall from time to time repair and maintain the sewers so vested in them, or such of them as may not be discoutinued, closed up, or destroyed as aforesaid. " ' And for the purposes aforesaid such board shall have full power and authornty to carry any such sewers or works through, across, or under any turnpike road, or any street, or place laid out as or intended for a street, as well beyond as within the limits of the metropolis, or through or under any cellar or vault under the carriageway or pavement of a,y street, and into, through, or under any lands whatsoever within orbeyond the said hmits, making compensation for any damage done therehy as hereinafter Provided, and all sewers and works from time to time made by the said board shall vest in them. "'Aud the said board shall cause the sewers vested in them to be constructed, covered, and kept so as not to be a nuisance or injurious to health, and to be properly cleared, cleansed, and emptied, and for the purpose of clearing, cleansing, and emptying the same they may construct and place, either above or underground, such reservoirs, sluices, engines, and other works as may be necessary, and may cause the sewage and refuse fzom such sewers to be sold or disposed of as they may see fit, but so as not to create a nuisance, and the oney arising thereby shall be applied towards defraying the expenses of such board.' "And by the second it is also enacted, 'That before the Metropolitan Board of Works commence any sewers and works for preventing the sewage from passing into the riser Thames as aforesaid, the plan of the intended sewers and works for the purpose aforesaid, together with an estimate of the cost of carrying the same into execution, shall be submitted by such board to the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, and no such plan shall be carried into effect until the same has been approved by su,h commissioners.' " I am further directed to forward to you copies of the several reports presented by the engineer of the Metropo. litan Board of Works, which reports contain drawings and sections, not merely of the plan B, but of other plans. "I am also directed to send you the enclosed copies of two letters from Captain Burstal, in reference to the flow of the tide in the river, which may be useful in your investigation. The first of these letters is dated July 30th, and the second November 18th, the latter having been addressed to the First Commissioner under the following circumstances:- _"In the month of June last the Metropolitan Board of Works submitted to the First Commissioner a plan having an outfall for the discharge of the sewage mnto the Thames, within the metropolis. This plan was at vaIance with the provisions of the statute contained in the clause to which I have already directed your attention, and was accordingly rejected by him. On the 5th day of November another plan was submitted by that board having an outfall so near to the metropolitan boundary that the sewage would necessarily return to the metropolis. This plan having been also rejected by the Firs Commissioher, he directed Captain Burstal to report to him what he considered to be the nearest points to the metropolis at which the sewage could be discharged, so that the provisions of the act might be complied with. Captain Burs tal fixed these points about about one mile above the town of Erith, on the south side of thc river, and at Rainham Creek on the north side, being a distance of about 15 miles from London-bridge. " The Metropolitan Board of Works have adopted these points for the outfalls, and have so far complied with the act. The First Commissioner therefore wishes you to consider all the details of the plan in relation to such outfalls; and he desires me to direct your attention especially to the fact that in the reports presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the statements made to him by the engineer at an interview reported in the morning papers of the 21st of NTovember last, there are great discrepancies as to the amount of sewage which is discharged. " It will therefore be necessary for you to obtain accurate information upon this important point, as the sizes of all the drains and-reservoirs must necessarily be determined by the quantit sewage. "The First Commissioner wishes also that vou sh4d not ^onfine yourselves merely to the plan subraitted by the Metropolitan Board of Works. He desires to have the fullest information you can afford him; and if you can devise any other seherae which may, in your opinion, be better calculated to casTy out the obiect in view, he requests that you will in your report set forth that scheme, in order that he may lay it before the Metropolitan Board of Works for their consideration. '" The plans now sent to you fix the outfalls at the points alr~ady indicated; but;, inasmuch as it is desired by the inhabitants of towns bordering upon the river below the 15th mile point that the main sewer should be extended, and that the outfalls should be placed at a greater distance from the metropolis, provided funds are obtained for the urpose of meeting the increased expenditure, the First minisoner wishes you to report upon any such more distant points of discharge as may fairly meet the requirements a luded to, and when you submit to him the plans for effecting that object you will set forth the increased cost consequent upon the extension of the works, the benefits, if any, to be derived by districts through which the extended main drain may pass, and how far those districts should contribute to the cost of such extended works. The First Commissioner feels sure that you will give to the various plans which, doubtless, will be laid before you such attention as they may deserve. "A commission is about to be appointed to inquire into the-most effectual means of distributing the sewage of towns and of applying it to beneficial and profitable uses, and it may therefore be desirable that you should put yourselves in commnutication with that commission, as a strong feeling seems to be entertained by members of the Metropolitan Board of Works and others that the sewage of the metropolis may be made a source of profit. " In conclusion, I am directed to request that you will report your views upon the question of the main drainage of the metropolis and the points of outfall at the earliest period consistent with the full consideration of so important I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, "ALFRED AUSTIN, Secretary."
SNOWSTORm iN ScoTLAND.-The weather during the past week has been very stormy. Snow feU early on Tuesday morning last, and at intervals through theweek we had heavy snow showers. On the coast there were from time to time partial thaws, but inland the snow accumnu. lated fast, especially in Buchan, and in the district lyig between Banff and Huntly and Keith. In consequence of the state of the roads in Buchan the Banff and Peterhead Defiance only made one journey on Thursday and Friday, and on Saturday did not venture out, and now lies in Banff. The Banff and Huntly coach started on Saturday morning with its usual complemeut of four horses, but would certainly have stuck at Blacklaw before it was half-way, had not Mr. Hay, farmer, and his sons turned out with six horses, four of which went before to make a track for the coach, to which the other two we*e attached; and in this manner the vehicle was got through. The coach did not leave Huntly that night, and now lies there. Seeing that there was no chance of the coaph returning that night, it was wished to inform the raiLway people in Aberdeen of the circumstance, that they might book no through passengers to Banff; but the frost had damaged the wires, and communication could not te effected. In consequence, there came on a large numberabout a score of passengers-who had no help for it but just rest in Euntly for the night. The next morning (Sunday) Mr.' Munro, the driver of the coach, started on hiorseback, taling with him six horses, each bearing a passenger on its i back, and the novel cavalcade, resembling an Eastern caravan, moved on through the snow, at soene of the worst places the riders occasionalJy falling off, and sometimes both horse and man being buried among the snow. 1'he party reached Banff about dusk, a good deal worn out by the long ride and the exposure. A postboy passing the same road, going up to Huntly, got of the road at the Moss of Auchintoul, and h's horse floundoring in a ditoh he was nearly an hour ere he got extricated. The Elgin coach, which passes nearly alorg the coast, and therefore over a road less covered with snow, cormes in only a little behind time, though yesterdaythe coach very nearly stuck in a snow wreath at Lhanbryde. The Portsoy, CuUen, and Keith omnibus returned on Saturday night from Keith, but yesterday only went from Portsoy to Cullen, not attempting the Keith road. The Banff and Oldmeldrum coach left yesterday morning, but only made as far as Cromnlet, four miles from Oldmeldrunm, where the coach had to be abandoned, some of the passengers accomplished in equestrianiam mounting the coachhorses for the rest of the way. The driter of the mail gig from Aberdeen to Banff, by way of Fyvie, who leftAberdeen on Sunday morning, was unable to get his gig further than New Macbar, only a few miles on of Aberdeen. There he mounted his horse, takin the bags behind him, and in this fashion got on to Straloch, a distance of about 20 miles, where, the day being so bad he was obliged to give in, getting shelter for his horse in a smithy. Yesterday being rather quiet, he was overtaken by7the driver, who left Aberdeen with that day's mails, and the two made the rest of the iourney toge thekl, each on horseback, until t'hey reached Cromlet, and taking the gig thence they reached Banff at 6 o'clock. The gig which left Banffon Sunday morning had to be left at Cromlet, the driver taking on the mails on horseback, and reaching Aberdeen at 6 o'clock p.m., instead of a httle past 12 noon. The drivers report the snow as heaviest. and the roads worstin the neighbourhood of Oldmseldram. With a dozen of men to accompany the coach yesterday brealdng the wreaths where deepest, we believe she could have pro. ceeded to Oldmeldrum, but durnug last storm little was done to clear the roads, which carelessness aggravates the Presenit inconvernence. We hope the partses concerned will exert themselves to clear the roads.-1 a2sffs7tire Journaa of Tues- day.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Tro

We locked him out of the office on the Taesday, and he remained in the upper part of the house, in the private apartments. Mr. J. lP Glanville.-I am clerk and cashier in the Bank of London. The prisoner kept an account at our bank-a private account of hisown. I received the check produced by the last wtness.

Witness.-I told him so. Mr. uIumphreys-What did he say? Witness.-He hesitated about the receipt, and I went again to look at the bankerr' book to see the date. Mr. Humphreys.-That is Messrs. Smith and Payne's I ook, I suppose? Witness.-Yes; I found I was correct, and I returned immediately to the prisoner's office. He then said to me, It's useless deceiving yof; I have used the money." MIr. Humphreys.-I believe you have been goodnatured enough to pay this money to Messrs. Kingafordv Witness.-Yes, I did. Mr. Humphreys.-Was that out of your own pocket ? Witness.-Yes, entirely. Mr. Iumphreys.-That,my Lord Mayor, is as far as I intend to go to-day with respect to that case. I will now proceed upon the other. Mr. Robert Woodward.-I live at 49, Lime-street, city, and am collector of the poor-rates and church-rates for the arissh of St. Andrew Uundershaft. Before the 18th of ovember last I had given several sums of money to the prisoner, amounting, rbeieve, in the aggregate to 2001. On the 18th of November I handed him a further sum of 901. It was his duty to pay this 2901. into the bankers of the City of London Union to the credit of the parish of St. Andrew Underhsaft. Messrs Smith, Payne, and Co. are the bankers of the City of London Union, and Mr. Gcorge Smith is the receiver. There is a distinction between the receiver and the bankers. I saw the prisoner on the following day, when he gave me the following receipt for the money (producing it) :- " City of London Union.-Received the 19th day of November, 1856, of the overseers of the poor of the parish of St. Andrew IUndershaft, the sum of two hundred and ninety pounds, towards the relief of the poor thereof, and towards defraying such proportion of the general expenses of the union as is lawfuRly chargeable on the said parish. For George Smith, Treasurer, E. CRososm," Mr. Humphreys.-Did he say anything to you when he gave you that receipt? Witness-I beheve not, except that that was the receipt rEdwin Stone Crosoer, clerk in the banking-house of Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co., said, -The receipt produced by the last witness is not in my handwriting, and I never received the sum of money to which it refers. There is no other person in the banking-house of the name of Crosoer. Mr. Wontner declied putting any questions to the witness. Mr. Humphreys.-That is the case as far as I purpose caring it to-day. I now ask for a remand. The LoRD MAYOn.-The evidence I consider quite sufficient to justify a remand. (To Mfr. Wontner.)-Have youf any observations to make? AMr. Wontner.-I make no objection to a remand, my Lord, and I will make no observations upon the case as it stands at present. The prisoner was then remanded till to-morrow (this day) week.

OOUBr OF BANKBUPTCY, Basinghll-strcc4 Dec. 31. fl THE MATTER OF THE ROYAL BHEITISE B.AIY. (Before Mr. Commisioner HoLRoynj A private sitting had been fixed for this morning for the examination of one of the former directors of the bank, bat no p articulars transpired. llr. L ATSR appled to the Court for the appointment of a further dividend sitting. He stated that the dlividend already declared of 5s. 6d. in the pound woulad be paid to the creditors who had proved up to the last meeting on Saturday and Monday next, at the head offices of the bank, in Threadneedle-street. Debts to the amount of about 360,0001. had been proved, bat several creditors had by inadvertence omitted to prove their debts. The assignees and himself (Mr. Linklater) were most anxious that no injustice should be done to any creditor, and desired to lace sl pon an equality as soon as possible. He thereore asked for an early meeting at which further debts mighti be proved, and, as it was not expected that they would amount to 100,0001. beyond the sum already proved, the assignees would have sufflcient fands to pay those creditors the dividend of 5s. 6d. in the pound. If the shareholders and debtors paid to the official assignee the amounts due from them a further dividend might 'also be declared at the same time. The CoassoNER said it was very desirable that the course proposed by Mr. Linklater should be adopted, and that all creditors should be placed upon an equal footing as soon as practicable. He accordingly appointed Saturday, the 24th of January, at 12 o'clock, for a further dividend. IN RE HumP3REY B.O.WN, SLP. At a later hour a petition for adjudication of bankraptcy was filed by Messrs. Linldater and Eiackwood against Humphrey Brown, of No. 2, Little Smith-street, Westminster, and of Tewkesbury, in the county of Glocester, member of Parliament for the borough of Tewkesbury, shipowner. The petitioning creditors are the assignees of the Royal British Bauk, whose unsecured debt is stated as nearly 40,0001. The petition has been balloted to Mr. Commissioner Evans. Mir. Humphrey Brown was formerly a director of the Royal British Bank. m dEs-. This was a case involving a point of considerable importance to the trading community and the legal profession. The trader had been served with a preliminary process with a view to bankruptcy. A petition for private arrangement was therefore fLIed by the debtor. Notwithstandingthis petition an adjudication of bankruptcy was made. Mr. Bagley now appeared to support that adjudication. Mr. Lawrance contra. The COIRT held that the petition for private arrangement did not deprive the individual creditor of his right to bankruptcy. Adjudication confirmed accordingly.
POLICE. MA.SSION-Houms-The LosD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of two 51-notes from 'J. R. H.." and of 101. from " W. P.," for the poor-box. GuDisAT..-Charles Edldns, descri'ed as an "ent and process-server, was brought up before Alderman E for further examination relative to the charge of stealing a bill of exchange for 241. 14s., belonging to Mr. Johnson, a cabinetnaker of Moorfields. The prisoner was discharged. Alderman Cn&Lms begged to acknowledge the meipt of 21. from Glasgow from a shareholder in the Royal British Bank for Mfrs. Chipp, who has been a sufferer by its stoppage. Bow-sTREET.hulian Payne, a newsboy, formerly in the service of Mr. Pavey, of Holywell-street, newsvendor and publisher, was charged with obtaining 66 copies of The Ti4s bv false pretences from Janes Morgan, one of the clerks to Messrs. Smith and Son, wholesale newsvendors in the Strand. The prisoner, who was known at Messrs. Smith's, having frequently been sent for newspapers when in Mr. Pavey's service, called that morning and asked for "Pavey's papers." The clerk, supposing him to be stiiU in the employ, handed him the num of papers la. Pavey had ordered-namely, 18 with the impressedstamp and 48 "blanks,"or unstamped copies, The valne at the selling price was 11. 4s. 6d. Afterwards Mr. Pavey sent for the papers, and the trick was discovered. The prisoner's address being known to Mfr. Pavey, there was no difficulty in finding him. When apprehended he said he got the papers to oblige Mr. Pavpy's boy, to whom he had given them. The prisoner was discharged by Mr. Pavey about two months back. The prisoner said, he was asked by a boy, whom he believed to be in Mr. Pavey's service, to go in for tho papers, as he was better acquainted with the establishment and could get served more readily. He did so, bat on seeing Mr. Paveys boy in court he found that that was not the person to whom he had given the papers, MIr. HENBY thought it. very unlikely the prisoner would take that trouble to serve an employer who had discharged hinm. He (Mr. Henry) would send the case for trial, but for the present a remand would be necessary, that inquirv might be made as to his character. Remanded accordingly. Mr. HENRY has received for the poor-box a 51.-note from "J. 11 H.," 1. from " G. W. D., " a post-office order for 11. from the " Rev. F. H.," and a letter from Mr. Sheriff Cole, enclosing an order for 10 chaldrons of coke for distributio among the poor. Acknowledgments were requested in f7e TimeS. WORSPI-STREET.-John Stannard and James Dellar, powerful bricklayers' labourers, were charged with sacrilege and:robbery. Driver Meredith, sexton of West EBackney Church, said,Shortly before 7 last night my two children ran home to my house, opposite the side of the church, and told me they had seen a light in the edifice. On looking myself I saw a glimmering light through the vestry window, and therefore sent for Williams, the beadle, with whom and my wife and family I went to the back door, and, having stationed other men we met on our way round the church to watch, we all went in at the back door, I carefully locking it after me. I lit a candle, and sent the beadle on first to the vestry, but he rushed bhak instantly, exclaiming in great alarm, " Oh, there's something up, let me out," and he went for more assistance, I locking the, door after him. I and a man named Tomkins then went to the vestry, and there we found the large iron chest, weighing between six and seven hundredweight, forced out of the wall, turned upside down, and lying in the middle of the 'loor. One of the iron "lap' had been forced off it, and the escocheon and handle had been wrenched awvay, and it was plain, from the marks of violence on the chest, that Feat force had been used in endeavours to bar.t it open. The chest contained a silver flagon, two chalices, patens, collecting plates, spoons, alms-dish, tablecloths, sacramental wine, &c., and a crowbar and chisel were lying beside it. I then distinctly heard footsteps of more than one person further up the church, followed by an attempt to get out at the back door I had locked, and on our going towards the door, my candlein one hand and my staff in the other, while passing a fight of narrow steps leading down to the vaults, T distinctly saw the prisoner Stannard and another man not in custody struggling with each other to get do wan the stairs first, and down them they directly after disappeared, Stannard, Dellar, and another man had been employed for two days before in covering brick tombs with stone slabs, but not in the church. While we were all examining the plate-chest in the vestry I suddenly heard some one say "1 Dear me, whats the matter-what have they been doing?" and on turning round I there, to my great astonishment, saw the prisoner Dellar close behind me. Where he came from I don't know, but I do know that I didn't let him in; and I said " You are not wanted here, and the sooner you're away the better;" and he left almost directly after at the back door, I thik, as I let somebody out; but I was so excited and confnsed I don't know. We afterwards, with the beadle, descended to the vaults, but found all the thieves had escaped somehow; and on looking- at the crowbar produced I found it was mixe, and that it had been taken from a shed 200 yards from the church. We next found that two other chests in the vestry had also been removed by the thieves. One wtas the old wooden plate-chest, containing metal tankards, &c., which had not bsen removed, and the other chest, which was of plate iron, and had stood on a hi h cupboard, only contained books, which were also not taien, though the lid had been forced upwards to admit a man's arm, the lock resisting all attempts to force it. Thomas Williams, the beadle.-When Meredith, the sexton, let me out, I went round to the front of the church, to see if the men I had placed there remained faithful, and I found them still there. I then got another man to keep watch at a grating leading down to the vaults, '.nd, having been axanletain by the sexton, and looked in'o 'he vaults without fmnding any one, I, to my great surprise, on tarninl round, there saw, standing close beside me, the very man I had placed to watch the grating outside, and who must have somehow got in the very moment after he had promised to watch. I said "H ulloa, why you have left the principal oat," but he said " Oh, ites all right, I placed a boy there," Ent I afterwards found that that very grating had been thrown up, and the escape was most likely effected that way. Inspector Langdon. of the N division.-I took Dellar in a house in Sandford-lane, and went in search of Stannard, whom the beadle at once identified. I told him what he was charged with, and he paused and said, "No, you are wrong, my friend; I am mnocent, I assure you," but I lodged him in the station, and, on examining the church, I found that the thieves had got in at the north side, the grating being torn out of the brickwork and lying down by the opening, and got out at the east side, the grating having been thrown over by those beneath it. Great power must have been employed to remove the iron chest in the vestry. It had been stronqly imbedded four feet deep in the side wall, and fixed with good and secure materials, but the whole had been torn away by some powerful lever. The Rev. Davis Lamb, the rector, who was accompanied by his curate, the -Rev. George Hervey.-The vestry, Sir, was a scene of desolation when I saw it, and the value of the plate in the iron chest was 1801. The prisoners were committed-till that day week for the completion of the evidence and to take the accomplice.

PUBLIC EXECUTIONS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-A strong opinion exists that the mode in which the ,execution of criminals is conducted in this country is more or less wrong. Many men, neither sentimnental nor enthusiastic, nor even philanthropists, have come to the conclusion that though public executions under the present system are deterring to a certain extent, yet they are exceedingly britalizing and calculated to harden and deprave the spectators. Much has been written on the subject, Your own very able leading articles and the letters of your -correspondents have thrown much light on this painful but interesting subject. Yet the problem remains unsolved how the terror of capital punishments is to be purified from the abominable accessories and consequences which Dickens and Thackeray have so vividly and usefuUy *described, I am nlot one of those who think that capital papishments are either unlawful or inexpedient. The passage In Holy Writ which says that the civil ruler bears the sword to be a terror to evildoers points out with infaUible authority both the lawfulness and the use of the extreme penalty. But xtillI must admitthat this dreadful prerogative of Sovereignty-the power of life and death-may be, and is in this country, exercised in such a way that one might almost doubt whether the moral pestilence which it spreads did not counterbalance the security that it affords to society. The Committee of the Hoase of Lords on Capital Punishmsents, presided over last session by the Bishop of Oxford, collected some remarkable evidence on the subject. The witnesses, among other things, stated that "all kinds of levity, jeering, laughing, hooting, whistling, while the man as coming up, while he is stiU suffering, while he is struggling, and his body is writhing, are going on with obscene expressions; " that " the death of the crsiminal is followed by sounds of low jesting and indecent ribaldry," "the hubbub and uproar being most disgusting; and that the whole town for the day was a scene of riot and drunkenness and debauchery of every kind." "The roads ap roaching it were, towards evening, filled with disorderly and drunlen persons: the country people flock in as to a bull-baiting or a cock-fight, and, after the solemn seene is over the day is invariably one of drunkenness, oaths, and disorder." Another witness says :-" The disgraceful state of the town on the day of execution exceedeci any Uhing I had before witnessed or could have credited." Their Lordships were so convinced of the evil effects of the present mode of carryine into effect capital punishmnents that they recounmended that execations should in future take place within the prison, and in the presence only of official and selected witnesses. Bat this opinion does not solve the difficulty. Your correspondent, " George Augustus Sala," truly says that private executions would not be tolerated in the present state of society in this country. Besides, certainly the terror preduced by the sight of death cannot be equaUed bythesoundof abell or the hoisting of a black fiag, which the Lords' committee propose; and these forms would soon lose any impressiveness. The sight of death is, indeed, most awful to hunman nature. "-0 si lit "Of terror, foul and ugly to. leT.1d, "Horrid to think-how horrible to feel !" The knowledge that a criminal had beeni put to death would no doubt be less terrible to the crihinal and dangerous population if they were prevented from seeing the execLution. If the plan of private exeonitions be rejected, what can be done to give a character to public execations more wholesome than that justly condemned by thie committee ? But there is another phase of this subject which must mot be grassed over. An able article on the execution of Marley has pointed out that, so far as regards the crimninal and the official persons, it was a cold businesslike proceeding-like an ordinary transaction, such as a distress for rent, or any other legal business to be transacted in a regular way. " It is," says the writer, speaking of the report of the newspapers, " dull, solid, coummonplace, unimpassioned, and matter of fact--rather a doniestic scene, without romance or pathos, dignity or symnpathy, feeling or principle." And he says, that the description given by the reporter reflects the general popular sentimnent on the subject. Now, here is another defect in the present system. It has nothing awful beyond the inevitable putting to death of a human creature. It is as unimpressive as the note in the calendar "Sus. )per col." And we must not be surprised if the rough ignorant barbarous people look upon it merely as an act of butchery-the miere killing of a snan, which they go to see from curiosity or desire for excitenient, and not much above a dog-fight or a bull-baiting * and every person of correct seeling -v,ho has seen an execution must have been struek with this, tllat beyond a glimpse of the chaplain's surplice there is nothing to reuind the spectators of the awful and sacred character with which the Christian religion invests death. The people see a man strangled, and that is all. Archdeacon Bickerstetls evidently felt this when he said before the Lords' committee, "1 would suggest that the churches might be opened. . . There might be a service at the time, and perhaps a prayer for the criminal." This is a very pregnant hint. I will mention a few facts bearing on the same point. At the execution of three men at Dundalk a few years ago, when the criminals came on tl:e sci ffold, al the people lknelt and prayed for them at the request of the priest. Those who were there describe the ses as m0ost eogIm and hIonourable to the Irish l -I-, r She prisoher5 woniftsei eA guilt and declared their penitence. An account describing a late execution for mtirder at Ancona says that the prisoncr knelt on the scaffold and repeated the Litany, the crowd making the responses. A friend of mine who was at arexecution formurder in Rouie, told me that the thousands of spectators round the sczffold recited the Afiscs-c and De Profundis in a loud voice. Hov different this is from "levity, jeering, laughing, hooting, wvhistling, low jesting, and indecent ribaldry" descrlbed before the comniittee ! This contrast surely suggests that the people in England should be botter taught than they are, and that it is by religious influences that executions can be purified frons their abominable and loatheosise effcts. The people should be made to feel that they are, so to speak, attending a deathbed scone of the most frightful and appaUing kind, and not the mere slaughter of a biped without feathers. Until you have done that, you have done nothing to purify an execution and render it truly useful as a solemn act of justice. This is the reai difflculty to be overconme and the object to be attained. I think I may add something useful to the diusn;sion by stating, from mv own knowlege, how the problem is solved in Italy. I will ilot attemiipt to determine how what I am about to describe can be applied practically in a Protestant country. But I willgive facts which cannot be without value. In every Italian city there is a numerous religious society of laymenof all classes called the "Confraternityof Death," or of Mercy, or (as at Rome) of San Giovanni Decollato, whose duty it is to attendI criminals before and at their execution A prisoner finally left for execution is removed to the chapel of the prison (instead of the condemned cell) and there, assisted by the chaplain and the brethren of the confraternity, who attend in turn day and night. The confraternity publishes a sort of proclamation, announcing to the citizens the dreadfiul ev'nt about to take place, and asking for their prayers. The exposition of the blessed sacramnent for the 40 hours' prayer then commences in the churches, and the people attend in great numbers during the whole day, and even someticnes during the night. The prisoner is taken t3 the place of execution (usually outside the town) in the following manner. First the great black cross and banner of the confraternity is seen slowly advancing, followed by the members, waLkimg two and two in their black cassocks and their hoods over their faces, with apertures for their eyes. As they proceed along the streets they recite the Penitential Psalms aloud. They are followed by the litter for the dead body, carried by four of their nuomber, and then coines the convict, assisted by the clergy and brethren. It would be difficult to describe the awe which this procession causes as it slowly passes through the streets; the silence broken only by the voices of the priests and brethren and the people who join them in the responses, and the tolling of the neils of the churches. At the scaffold the Confraternity stand round and continue their devotions until the prisoner is dead, and then they remove the body in thd sane funeral procession. I need scarcely add that the place of executiont is kept clear during the night, and suppers, or revelry, or open publichouses there would bring punishment on the ofienders. Whatever may be the religious opinions of your readers, I think most people will agree that the solemn proceeding which I have described invests an execation with a salutary character, and is calculated to produce a great impression of awe on the public mind, counteracting the brsitalizing *endency of the spectacle of a violent deatt.. At any rate, I venture to hope that this view of the subject may suggest something useful to others, and I therefore beg thi#; my letter nmay find a place in your columons. Your obFdi' nt servant.

IXTEREST A ND DISCOU,yT. TO THE EDITOR OF TErE TIMES. Sir,-Having endeavoured in a former letter to distin. guish terms, we have now to treat of the market of discount and short loans, apart from that larger mass of transaCtions which are affected by interest whenr it is the price of capital in quite a different condition. In these questions we sometimes hear the word capital dividea, as if there could ba capital of two or more species; but we are more inclined t0 generalize all capital as of one kind, although capable of many conditions; just as water, whether i% is above the mill or below the mill, is the same water, bat is saperior in value because it has command of greater powers. Dering the last eight years the scale of discount at the Bank ef England has been as follows:- In Uctober, 1S85, and in October, 1856, an unusual distinction was made of one per cent. in favour of biLs having not more than 60 days to run, the standard term being 95 days. The good policy of this species of change is questionable; as to ordinary minds it would seem that, the Bank having a larger or a smaller fand to deal with, yet always limited, the price or hire of their loans is the obvious and fairest mode of distribution, and that aU others must be needlessly perplexing to the borrowers and liable to evasion. Although the fluctuations as shown iu the above table have only amounted on the average to about four in the year;although the natural fluctuations must have been much more frequent, according to the laws or rules already adverted to ; and although it has been shown that to attempt to contravene those laws is injurions, or at best useless, yet have the Bank directors been severely handled for their chauges. In the conflict of opinion their task is not an easy one, for they are required to stand still and to move forward at the same time. But, in point of fact, they have not the power that is generally attributed to them; they may for a time, and to their own detriment, make the rate of discount lower than it naturally would be, but they cannot make it higher. This last being the question with which we have now to deal, we may safely affirm that the existing high rate of discount has not been caused by the operations of the Bank. When the new fields of gold had been discovered in California and Australia it was said, under the authority of persons not undeserving of attention, that one of the effects of large importations of gold into Europe w ould be to reduce the accustomed rate of discount. How this delusion could arise, unless by mixing the terms Icapital" and "coin" into one idea, it is difficuIt to conceive; bat this is clear, that if a perpetual annuity of three gold sovereigns is saleable for 90 gold sovereigns when gold is scarce, the same annuity will not be saleable for any more when gold is plentiful. To estimate gold in gold is like weighing water in water. The increase of the qaantity of gold wil increase the price of commodities, but cannot affect the rate of discount. The adverse exchanges have been referred to, particularly with India and China, which for many months consecu. tively have occasioned shipments of silver from this country to the amount. of 1,100,0001. or 1,200,0001. monthly; but if adverse exchanges and the conseq uent export of tha precious metals are really the cause of high discount, how does it happen that the recipient countrie s have exhibited the same phenomenon during the same time? About a year ago discount was quoted in Calcutta at from 10 to 12 per cent. ; in Hamburg it was for months at 7 to S per cent., and in France at 6 per cent., which is the highest rate permitted by the law. The insolvency of the Royal British Bank and the probable caution induced thereby on the part of other banks of the same description have been brought into the category of reasons for a high scale of discount, but if this circumstance has had any effeeb at all it must have been, in comparison with the real causes, which wiU presently be mentioned, almost inappreciable. If there were no Bank of England, or no banks at all, no gold and no silver -for these are mere ripples on the surface -the great stream of interchange might stil roll on, the same relations between borrower and lender might not the less exist, and the issue of their transactions be not very different from what it is under the present artificial and greatly overrated arrangements. It was stated by the late Mr. Rothschild in his evidence before a committee of the House of Commons that, according to his observation, the rate of interest had usuaUy been lower on the continent than in England. This circumstance deserves notice, as the commonly received opinion is the other way. It may also be mentioned incidently that previously to the importations from the new goldfields the quantity of the precious metals existing in Europe in the form of coin, plate, and bar had been computed from materials supplied by Baron Humboldt, Mr. Jacobs, and others, to amount to 2,000,000,0001. sterling, one-fourth or one-fifth of which was supposed to be gold, and the rest silver. Having now divested onr subject of some popular fallacies with which, as appears to ourselves, it was beset, mentioning, as we passed on, such incidents as might really or apparently bear upon it, let us proceed to show that the high rate of discount now prevailiag is the result of causes not only sufficient to explain it, bat of such a nature as to render itan inevitable item in the account of passing eventz. When a large demand for borrowing is opposed to a small supply of loanable capital the rate of discount rises, and, ander the converse form of the proposition, when a small demand for borrowing is opposed to a large supply of loanable capital the rate of discount falls as a mstter of course. The same rule extends to the interest-markeb, only not so quickly or so perceptibly. Among the prominent causes of demand for borrowing in recent and present operation are Government loans, public enterprises, and commercial profits, all being of unusual magnitude. The Governments of Great Britain, France, Turkey, and Sardinia have been borrowing to the amount, collectively, of about 100,000,0001. sterling. Russia and Austria, it is known, are weU enough disposed to borrow as soon as they an find lenders on terms that may be mutually satisfactory. The public enterprises to which we would direct attention are the railways in India, involving an aggregate outlay of from 40,000,0001. to 50,000,0001. sterling, and in Canada of from 20,000,0001. to 25,000,0001. sterling. These, in both cases, are rendered the more attractive by some similitude of a guarantee from the respective Governments. Railway works are not the less continued both at home and on the continent, telegraph companies aU over the world, joint. stock banks in every corner of the country, and discount conpanies for facilitating investments. Of commercial profits-that is, in the limited sense of such as are derived from the carrying and exchanging of merchandise-two such years as we have now last concluded have been for a long time unknown. It may be agreeable to theorists in currency, for reasons of their own, to condemn the 1S changes in the Bank of England rate of discount which have been made in the same period, but they will hardly find the practical merchant who will support them in asserting that a high rate of discount is necessarily destructive of commercial prosperity. The only class of traders of whom it can be truly said that they have suffered from a high rate of discount are those who carry on business of a nature that requires more capital than they are masters of, and have thus been called on either to curtail their transactions or to obtain loans fromn the more provident at a price to suit both parties. That the demand for borrowing has been and continues unusually large is thus briefly explained, and this might have happened under circumstances in which the stock and supply of loanable capital would have kept easy pace with It; but we have not been so fortinate. We have had war, which, to adopt the language of one of "M Mercator's" letters, " is a great destroyer of capital," and we have almost a double weight of taxation, which, if it does not destroy capital, does not certainly improve it, and renders it of no effect for lending purposes. The capital destroyed in 2Europe by the recent war-for we must not limit our view of this question to our own country-must have been not less than 200,000,0101. sterling, and the annual taxation, we know, has in this country risen from about 50,000,0001. to about 85,000,000. sterling. How much it may have risen from the sanme cause in the other countries engaged or looking on, we do not know, but it must be very large. Be it observed that all these vast demands can only be met by that portion of the general capital wisieh, like water at a high level, is moveable and immediately applicable to aUl purposes. It is of no use to talk of the hun. dreds of millions that may be leaned upon land, for these are as fixed and inapplicable as the land itself. While the more obrious causes of existing relations between borrower and lemlor have been in action, another, not so apparent yet by mo mieans inconsiderable, has coin. cided, in the new means of eommmosication that have been vou.ehsafed tO us; the rais.y, tbe~O;ean steamer, and the telegraph wire, strange as it enyseer, haviecooperated to import, in a ma2nner, the prines of "fsign liorrowers into our boundaries.

Canada Da India are scarcely more remote from London than Cornwall vas, or Glasgow, a century ago. Is it surprising th, that the mnoveable capital of this country should frer.ly tow inathe direction of our fellow-subjects eastward and westward, considering that they offer us better terns ior it than can be obtained at home ? No proofs are wantirg of the rapidity with 'which the wealth of this busy coumtry is wccumnlated; it may be that the aggregate of income over expenditure reaches 100,0M0,0001. a-year, and it cannot be taken at less than 60,000,0001. The real relief, asd there is no other, to the present state of the discount-market is to be sought for in these savings. It has been said, and may tightly be said of all countries, except England, " 31ake capital dear, and it wiU come to you." Doubtless when capital becomes dear in France or Germany it is soon imported thither from England, because Bngland is the purveyor of capital to all the world; and, although everybody is in debt to England, England is in debt to nobody. But England cannot on a sudden call back her loans; for the most part they are too far out of reach, and, from their nature, a regular tribute in the form of interest and profits is all that should he reckoned upon; bat we may say this in England, " Make capital dear, and it will remain with you." The discount-market should be allowed to have as much elasticity and free play as possible, and aU laws, all schemes to the contrary, should be discountenanced as containing more of evil than of good. There is a school, we know, in which this doctrine is condemned, but if a high rate of dis. count will impound and keep at home, where and when it it is wanted, that capital which would otherwise be dragged abroad at the rate of 1,000,0001. or 2,000,0001. stvrling in a week the public mind should be disabused and put upon its guard, that it may not too hastily condescend to a course of argument which the experience of the times we are engaged in so visibly contradicts. I am, &c.. _A MERCHANT. London, Dec. 30.
I THE TIOKET-OF-LEA YE SYSTEM. TO THE EDITOZ OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I know not how it may have arisen, but there seems to be an universal impression that the ticket-ef-leave men are the authors of all the crimes which have lately taken place; that the most expert garotters, the most successful housebreakers, and altogether the most dangerous neigh. bours are the unfortunate men to *vhom license tickets have been granted. Let it be but hinted that a few ticket-of-leave men are in a certain neighbourhood, and immediately numberless letters are forwarded for publication in Tlhe Tmes, setting forth the varied provisions made, and the wondrous precautions taken in the shape of mysterious wires attached to bells, and shutters, and gates; knives of every conceivble construction, pistols of almost every calibre, and walks ing-sticks with secret springs, disclosing all kinds of naur. derous instrtuments, as effectual safeguards against sudden attacks from these people. Why this feeling should have got abroad I know not; certainly not from newspaper reports of the doings of ticket-of-leave men, for, if we only look into the accounts which have been published of the misdeeds of our oriminals, wo cannot fslI. but be struck with the fact that not more three out of every 100 com. mittals are found to b e license-holders. Wherefore, then, this universal cry against the system of tickets of leave ? Does it not spring in a great measure from atotal ignorarce of the working of the system? and does it not betray a most un-English weakness,-a fear of, and. an incapacity to cope with, our criminal population? I think were some of your correspondents to pay a litfle more at. tention to the actual state of the ticket-of-leave system, and a little less to their own unfounded fears; were they to ascertain, as might easily be done, how the act has operated hitherto, and not condemn it wholesale, as they do at present, they would soon view the whole subject in a very different light, and, instead of wishing theirconvicts shipped off to Western Australia, as suggested in last Saturday's Times by Mr. WiUiam Howitt, they would try and reform them at home. If the cheapest and most expeditious mode of getting rid of our convicts be al that is required, then why not hang them at once 1-that will settle them effectually, and you need fear them no longer; but, if society will prefer not to do this-if it will insist upon keeping them, then comes the question which everyone is trying to solve, " What is best to be done with them ?" Whether is it better, as Mr. Howitt suggests, to ship them off at once to found a colony in some part of Australia, and, when that has been founded, ship them off again to some other part to found another, and so on ad tafisium ; or, as Baron Alderson advises, to educate them first here, in our prisons, and then transport them; or, as Punch would have you, make them State debtors, and keep them at work until they had balanced their accounts? Of the three I confess I like PuNde's proposal the best; there is something thoroughly English in it; it has a smack of business about it that is pleasing to our national character. if we must spend money on a set of bad fellows, we like to look forward to the time when we shall receive it back in one shape or another. Now, if Mr. Punch would only go a step further, and show how his scheme could be carried out, -not in the style of a certain Captain Bobadil, but how it could be done practically,-he would confer an immense benefit on the British public; but I fear he wil have diffi. culty in doing it. In whatever light we view the question we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there have been so many occurrences of late tending to strengthen the prejudice in the public mind against ticket-of-leave men that, however well disposed the license-holder may be, however anxious to reform himself and obtain the confidence of his fellow-man, he is looked upon with grave suspicion; every act is watched, every deed mistrusted, and every enror condemned, so that the disadvantages under which he labours are truly great, and require no orcdinary amount of moral courage to stand up against them. Yet, notwithstanding all this, le' it be borne in mind that, after making every possible allovance for errors in statistical returns, and the difficulty of obtaining correct information as to the number of recoinmnittals, we may safely state that 70 or S0 out of every 100 criminals under license have become, so far as w e have any means of knowing, industrious men, and, for aught we know, good and useful members of society. We hear a great deal about those who have relapsed into crime; every newspaper lends itself to spread the report of a ticket-of-leave man having been re-committed; but we hear nothing about those who have been reformed. The small 12 per cent. or so of relapses has an echo in every corner of the empire, while the 70 or 80 per cent, of reforms has ePt th9 aid of a single voice. This is a lamentable fact, and the more painful when it is remembered that many of our judges, in their recent charges to grand juries, have rather confirmed the evil impression than sought to remove it. The country seems determined to have the convicts away, it matters not where, so that they are away; but I would ask, is it not reasonable that an act which has been in operation only for three years, and has had hitherto to contend with the very worst description of criminals, should be allowed a fair opportunity to test its efficiency? It has been very successful thus far, and there is every probability, if it be allowed to remain in force, that in the course of a few years it will realize the sanguine expectations of its sup. porters. Why, then, not aid in carrying it out thoroughly, and help the ticket- of-leave man when he has left prison to become an honest man ? In all the convict prisons almost every description of trade is taught; the prisoners, both male and female, undergo good moral and religious, as well as scholastic training, and are fitted, so far as their teachers can render them so, for becoming good and useful servants when their term of imprisonment has expired; but the difficulty is to find employment for them, and so sca'ter them as to keep them from congregating together in large masses, and by all means to remove them from the scene of their former vices, and from the influence of their old associates. Mr. Howitt's and Baron Alderson's plan of transporting them would answer a part of this end, but it would not answer the whole; it would likewise remove them from the in- tuence of that good example which, if here, they can see everywhere around them, and the effect of which, no doubt, produces a wholesome impression upon them. I contend it would be much more humane to keep them at home; and when they have become thoroughly reformed mnen and women,then let means be afforded them to emigrate and found colonies, if you will. But it is not the ticket-of-leave man we have to fear, it is the man, woman, and boy who live by dishonesty, but who hitherto, although known to the poliece, have managed to escape detection. It is this class we should endeavour to put a stop to, and not allow them to prowl about like so many wolves until we have caught them in the aECt of steal. ing or housebieaking or garotting before we attempt to lay hands upoR them. If we would stop the river at its source, xely upon it we need fear no inundation. Therefore, if Goverament would appoint persons to look after this class, giving thema power to send every one to a house of reformation who voud not show to their satisSac. tion that he or she obtained an honest livelihood, and there malte them work at a trade, if they knew one, or, if not, teaeh them one, and keep themin antil they had not only learned their trade, but lied .peid the expense of their in. atruction and support,-if Government would do this, the ticket-of,eave question would .no iloger be one of d.ifiSult aolution. filhen, to prov.de.ousploymesnt for such as these, as wellaaor4ie!cket-of-leare zeen-wbeon t y leave pris;on, if EuggeSt the forxwfion of a eonpany, with; moderat AVi- soners shall be forwarded, together with full information as to their capacity acd the places whence they wera originally committed. This, of course, under the direct sanetion of the Government. That agents, or persons duly qualified, be engaged to open depots or shops in the various places selected according to the number of prisoners sent ont; and to these agents, the persons selected be sent; that suitable apartments be procured for them in different parts of the town-rooms, if for angle men, and houses if for married; that they be paid after a fixed rate of wages, and be required to deposit from week to week a certain portion of their earnings with the company, who would pay them interest upon it. This provision would serve as a wholesome check upon, the men, and wouldlikewise promote a spirit of economy among them which would be found highly beneficial. As it mright be desirable to employ nob criminals only, but any other class of persons who would conform to the regulations of the society, in case suafficient employment could not be afforded to all who might apply for it Goyernment might lend it an indirect support, by granting to it a portion of those contracts for which it is in the habit of constantly receiving tend ers. By this means regular employment would be iasured, and the snccessful operation of the scheme would have the effect of not only preventing as far as possible relapses in criminalS but the commission of crime in those who, for want of employment, might be induced to commit offences againsb the law. Tnere are many who would oppose a step like this being taken by the Government; they would contend that Government has no right to interfere with legitimate trade, and thereby take the bread out of the poor man's month. I would reply that from the very fact of full employment being afforded to our prisoners we might look forward with certainty to the period when the annual expenditure of 300,000. or 400,000. would be done away with, and the poor man would in the reduction of taces, or in some other way, reap the benefit of it. Besides, Government has already in very many departments of manufactures inter. fered with trade, and yet there is no town in England that has suffered in consequence. Indeed, Government may go on manufacturing as they please in prisons and workhouses, and trade will never sustain the slightest check or injury by it. The field of demand is still too wide to exhibit sensitiveness to the comparatively limited produce which such institutions can ever contribnte, and from their competition trade need have no just fears. Women, with some slight alteration in the management and arrangement for their location and distribution, might likewise be employed in various works suitable for them. Indeed, there can be no valid reason why the boots and shoes, the clothes, hats, and caps, worn by our soldiers and sailors] should not be made by our male criminals, and the subjects of our reformatory systems, and the hose and linen &c., worn by them by our females. All this could be done with a great saving to the State, and without injury to trade. Then, when any of them had earned sufficient money to enable them to emigrate I would advise that every facility should be afforded them for that purpose; that, in fact, they should be encouraged iu such a course, so that our colonies, instead of being supplied with our worst criminals, as heretofore, might have honest and industrious men and women sent to them. Had we a scheme such as this once thoroughly established -did we lay hold of crine and pluck it up by the root, or tak'e theyoungsaplingandtrain it as we wish,-we might at the onset have many difficulties to overcome, and the State a considerable additional expense to bear; but in the end, and that end not a far distant period, we should comparatively do away with the Class of crime which is now almost everywhere increasing upon us. We might commence in a quiet, unostentatious way, increasing our establishments as hose already commenced had become successful, and thus go on until the whole scheme were fally and permanently carried oct.

Fossrr REPtAAIs.-The Qutebec Mercei'y of December 4, says:-''Some fossil remains of a monster animal, supposed to be those of a mastodon, have lately been discovered in the county of Elgin. The St. Utornas Dispatch desoiabes them as follows :-' We were shown on Tuesday last, by Mr. Freeborn Berdan, the gigantic tooth of a monster animal, found on the farm of Ar. Samnel Berdan, two miles west of Five Stakes, while digging in a light sandy loam on the edge of a small marshy spot, about 20 inches below the surface. The tooth was about seven or eight inches in length across the face, by four or five in width, and seemed to have been broken outof a jaw. The surface was perfectly smooth, and appeared to us as if it was petrified, or very heavily enamelled. It was of a mottled gray colour at the upper part, running down to a dark brown at the basee & he interior was similar to a white, calcined bone. AU"Berdan also foutnd two enormoius tusks eight and a half feet fromn one end to the other, and curving back so that the ends are nearly parallel to each other; also two thigh bones three feet long, and an underjaw bone over three feet long, several ribs froa three to four feetin length from point to point, and six teeth weighing sLx pounds or n-ore each. These bones, as near as can be ascertained, are supposed to belong to a mastodon, an extinct species of the elephant, and have probably remained undisturbed where they were for centunes before the continent was discovered. Some parts of them were in a high state of preservation, while others would crunble to pieces at the slightest touch.
