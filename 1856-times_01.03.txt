: INES OF COURT COAMIISro2.I - - ' The Commissioners ApPonted to inqutie into theajtanUgmnits in the Inns of Court'and Chanceryfor prom6tin «the study of the law and iur%trudence have made their repor. and, although dated th6 10h of Augst, 1855. it has but. recently been published. It is sisgine by Sir William Page Wood, Sir John TaylorColDWlHdg-1Wa-pier, theAttorneyGener4l, the Solicitor-General, Sir Thomas Erskine Perry, hisr. Johsi'Georgi -Shaw -Lefere, 31r. Seatingi M1r.' Green. wrood, and'3Ir. lavie..; After making some7-preliminary observations the conmnissioners state that, withregardto the Ians of Chaucer;, they do: not find that there exist any meansof-rendering their funds available torthe'promotion of the-study of the law; and they add that these inns havain soine-instances become private property, and in others are heavily indebted, while in no instance have they been able to tuaco such an -appopration of the funds. is to fix upon the inns a-laic abiy to contibution to any general professionalpurpose. Thecommissioners thei r. orgef athe details upon this subject, 'which will be foimd-in'the evidence of the different treasurers, principals, and other officers of these kinns and in the stateients received froth them, and printed in the appendix, but do-not think it neacessry or useful further to notice these inns in their report.- - The commissioners next describe the nature of the property of the several Inns of Court, and state their income anid expenditure, and then proceed with reference to the modeinwhichthe study of the- law can be best promoted, and under this head have directed their attention, firstly, to the present method of conductin *leaal education in this country; secondly, to the systems of legal education pujrsued in Sco 'tl e pirisipalSat1es ofEurope, and in the United. States of Amedncsi;- and, thirdly, to the improve:. mnents which may'be madein our own system. ;Upon these several -points-the commnissioners have exaniined witnesses, md' briefly state the result -of the evidence before submitting their own suggestions as to the course to be posuedfor.the future. They next consider the objects to6 beM had view in. providinig fbr the professional education of law-students -of the Inns of Couot-t1. The duty which the several societies to which the power of callig students to the bar has been confided owe to'the stndent. 2. The duty theyowe to the community-while conferrngL on 6ertain selected andividuals a peculiar pOSition and atteadant privileges. After duly considering these inportant topics, the report then proceeds to set fort the best mode of carrying such a system of instruction, as they conceive to be necessary, into effect, and the expediency of having one system, common to all the Inns of Court,. for testing the generalInowledge of persons to be admitted as students, and the legal knowledge to be required as a eondition for the call to the bar. The commissioners,- in concluding their report; recommend that the Inns"of -Court should be united in a university, but still preserving their independence respectively as distinct societies with- respect to their property and internal arrangement, and that sach University mmght not only regalate the examinations, but suiet likewise, confer degees in law. It is observed- that suhdegrecs nght be o considerable professional value, that early opportunities of practice are of areat value to the -barnister in stimulating his industry and in the timely development of his talents. Such opportunities might more frequently arise if the soicitor had any such grounds to justify his selection of a young barrister as might be afforded by degrees or. other distinctions granted to students in respect of their examinations; and that countrygentlemen also, who are not desirous of practisin as baryistersm-enigt nevertheless beglad to avail themves of the Oportunity of legalstudy aorded by such an university. T fhe commissioneradeeniit advisablethat thereshould be'established a preliminaryexaminationforadmissiontothelinsof Court of persons who have not taken a uLiversity degree, and that there should be examinations the passing of which should be reqnL4te.for the call to the bar, and that the foiar ILuis of Court should be United in one uiiversity for the purpose of these examinations and of conferring degrees, and they then propose the following, heads of a scheme for that "1. That a university be constitated with a power of conferring degrees in law, of which the constituent members shall be the chancelor, barnisters-at-law, and masters of laws. - "2. The chancellor of the university to be elected for life, the electors being all barristers (including serjeants) and mnasters of laws. ° "3.

"4. That one-ourth of the senate shall retire annually, but the retiring membersto be re-eligible. I "5. That a vice-chancelor shall be elected by the senate fromntheir owa bod,and upn his ceasing to be a member a fresh election shall take place. The vice-chancellor shall preside at the meetings of the senate with the privilege of a casting rote. (The details -as. to conveniing meetings, a quorum, and the lik;e, wi ll be provided for in any charter or act of incorporation.) .- "6. That the senate and vice-chancellor shall not receive any emolament, but shaU have power to appoint a treasurer, a secretary or registrar, and'other proper officers. "7 . That the existing atraingements for the payment of the readers of the Inns of Court be continued, and that the senate shall from time to time direct the payment of sauch fees as they shall think fit by the students towards the expenses of tlie university, and shall transmit tables of suchees to the Inns of Court. . And any further funds thatmay be requisite shall be provided by the Inns of Coint "S. Thatthemeetinigsofthe senatebeinthehallof one of the Ins of Court. " 9. That the goverment of the university be the chancellor and senate. "10. That there shall be,- "(L) A preliminaryexamiiation of candidates for admission as students at the Inns of Cout. " (2.) An examination in law of students desirous of beng caUed to the bar or taking a degree of master in lavs. That there shall be two of each of sach examinations resctively held evert year, the one shortly before Michaehnas Term, and the other shortly before Easter Term. " 11. That no person shall be exanined for admission as a student at an Inn of Court unless he shaU produce his conditional admission by the inn, subject only to his passing sudl examination. "1 2. To pass such preliminary examination schli 'persons musb possess a competent knowledge of English history and "13. No person shall be admitted as a student into any In of Court unless he shall have passed the preliminry examination, or have obtained the degree of a Bachelor of Arts, or Liceptor or Bachelor in Law at some university within the Bntish dominions. "14. The subjects for the examination of -students desirous of being called to-the bar or of taking a degree in laws shall be divided into two branches, consisting of the following subjects:- "First branch-(a.) Constitutional law and legal history. (6.) Jurisprudence. (c.) The Roman law. -. "Second bmnch-(c.) Commonlaw. (6.) Equity. (c.) The law of real property. " 15. That no person shall be called to the bar unless he shaU receive a- certifeate from the senate of having passed a satisfactory examiination in at least one sUbject in each of the above branches. "16. That students may present themselves-as candidates for honours at the examinationin such branches, and, if they shall he deemed by the examiners to have-passeda creditable examination in all the subjects of either branch, they shall be entitled to a certificate of honour in respect of such examination; end, if theyshall have passed alikeexamination in all the subjects of beth branches, they shall-be entitled to the degtedof master of laws.- The senate to make regulalions in respect of the classification of the students for henours. 17. That at each examination a studentship of 50 etineas per annum, to: be held. -for four years, 'be awardedto the master in laws who. shal have passec the best exahination.Tht- aepsethbetxai "18 That all personi desirous of being caUed to the bar, and all candidates for honours, other than candidates for the studentship, may, as they think fit, pass their examination in each branch either at the s-ame time or at separate times; but the candidates -for the studentship must be examined in bDth branches at the same time. "19. Tha't the' examiners be appointed by the senate. "20. Thatreaders be appointed, asat present, bythelnus of Court, the senate appointing the fifth -reader, now appointed by the Council of Legal Education, with vower for each Bench (if it think fit), subject tothe approbation of the senate, or' for the senate, on the joint application of all the Benches ofallthe mns, to appoint additihonal readers. 212L The inns-of Court not to be compelled to call to the bar those6who have passed an examination, but to retain their.present powerswith reference to the callingof students to the bar, and the dis-barring of persons after their call, subject to theappeal to the judgesY : The commissioners state they have not thought it to be within the scope of their conimssiOn to consider whether it wold,be expedient to associate the advocates of Doctors'commons with the great body of the profession who are members of the iiais of -Courtb; bit therewlvoula, 'at -it appears to them, -be very little dificulty in' rendering them cor.stituent. members of the iniversity if it were thought advisable. . - The commissioners state with regara to Serjeants'-inn, Bt msust be remefibered that the judges are al me imbers ^r that inn, and as they exercise an. appellate jurisdiction ant the Ins of Coairtin regard to the call to t' bara withv,hichthey -did not propose to interfere, it did not seem to them desirable to introduce that inn as part ofthe-university. The commissioners would venture to suggest, im conclulsion, that the severalaivesities c!f the iefo wuld, in thoir:judgmiut,. eo-operate more sffestually in advancing legal reducition by a sound an& li'beral training for the atmidenti intendiis aftei-*atdA te eattcr iipon thefesfioo of the law-a training- himitel -in respqect to thiat study t4- eseralprinciples- thuan;byissezesinge<Amount of.spcial nstiuctio whch the Innis ci Cir should properly sup' y.

LONDON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 3, 18-. A notion has, swe find, obtained currency among the public, of which it is extremely important that they shouldc be disabused. It is supposed that the propositions of Russia, which we alluded to yesterday, have been put forth as a counterproposal to the overture of France, Einand, and Austria, intrusted to the 'keeping -of Count VrLmirEX EsTxwAzy. The fact is entirely the other way. Before those propositions were formudated Rusgia had offered her solution of the difficulty. She has been on the present occacion, and the peacemongers are welcome to make the most of it, the first to offer terms of accommodation. if we are correctly informed, Prince GOaTsmuxoY7, at least three weeks since, went to Count BuoL and announced that he brought peace. ,' Myr master," hesaid, "conentstotheneutralia" ti= of the Black Sea, and inl order to tbAt neu" trxsation is willing that the fleeta of the allies "' sheuld be banished from its water, and that the Sts Wrbef of p-ofEwac to be kept 4Vu.i&A , "Turkey should be regulated by treaty between "themselves, to which the other Powers should be "no parties."* To this the Western Powers replied, rather drily, that they did not think negotiations for peace could- be advantageously commenced on such a basis, and so the Rusian dove flew back with the olive branch in her mouth to the ark from which she had been despatched on this hopeless errand. This overture the Russian organ in Belgium now seeks to nanufacture into a counterproposition by Russia, and would lead us to believe that terms so ridiculous have been gravely offered and can be seriously entertained. This we have said is not the case. Russia has made no counter-proposition, for the very simple reason-she has had no time to maake any. Her reply is yet to come, and when it does come to be considered, whatever it may be, we doubt not that Prussia, having first earnestly recommended Russia to accept our terms, will as earnestly recommend us to accept hers, and that Austria, while regretting the stubbornness of the EMzPEROn, will yet find in his answer so much of the elements of the basis of a negotiation that she will not feel called upon to convert her uitimatnou into an ieltimatiss, and, least of all, into an iu7timatissimurn. Why Russia made this absurd advance it is not easy to say; perhaps she w3a in a talkative humour; perhaps she desired to persuade her German allies that she was anxious to make peace, and that the fault must lie with States who were insolent enough to refuce terms so advantageous. We know not what eF-rct the proposition was intended to have; but one effect it certainly could not have-that of a counter-proposition to terms not yet offered nor agreed upon. We observe that it is stated by a foreign coutemporary that the Western Powers have no objection to the pacification of the Black Seabeing left to be provided for by treaty between Turkey and Russia. This ought not to be, and we are quite confident is not, the case. We cannot conoeive on what grounds even Russia herself,coula gravely submit such terms to the consideration of the allies. If Turkey had been able to treat with Russia as an equal-if, indeed, she had been in any degree able to support in the presence of her mighty neighbour the attitude of an independent State, the inter- vention of the allies might very possibly have I been dispensed with. But, what with those who were avowedly in Russian pay and those who only desired an opportunity of becoming so, it was felt, and justly felt, that the Divan was unfit to be trusted with the safety of its own country, and the very last assembly in the world to which could be committed for a single moment the guardiansbip of the destinies of Europe. We were obliged to take more care of Turkey than would have been taken by the Turks themselves, and to watch over her destinies with more care than she could be inducedto bestow on her own. The only act she has done as a Sovereign Power was to declare war at a time! when the allies believed that the possibilities of negotiation were'not yet exhausted, but since then how has she supported the vigour of that proceeding ? Her troops have indeed displayed the same stubborn valour and magnanimous contempt of death for which they have so often been remarkable, but where have we found the men to direct and to train them? The upper classes of Turks know not how to command, nor how toI govern. They owe all the success they have ohtained to 'the agency of renegades or of soldiers of fortune who have volunteered their services. Their civil government has been a succession of miserable intrigues, in which the factions of the Seraglio have contended for the last plunder of a perishing country. The absence of the English Ambassador for a single fortnight produced a revolution, and his return operated a counter-revolution. So low have probity andipublic spirit sunk in Constantinople that the allies have been obliged to appoint a commission to prevent the statesmen of Turkey from plundering the loan which the guarantees of England and France have enabled her to raise inther last extremity. Our correspondent considers that much will be achieved if the Commission) can induce the harpies of the Divan -to content themselves with the plunder of 1,000,000Z. out of 5,000,0001. Are these the men to whom the Western Powers are willing to intrust the guardianship of those terms which have cost them such infinite labour and expense to obtain? Are these the mento whom the statesmen of^Europe will be content to delegate their functions, and in whose sterling probity and enlightened wisdom they have found the steadfast and immovable bulwark which is to roll back day after day and year after year the ever-swelling tide of Russian insolence and aggression ? Are we to intrust the safety of Europe to men so signally incapable of providing for their own, and rely on the probity and discretion of a body where all that is not fanatical is venal, and all that is notvenal is fanatical ? When we drewthe sword to prevent the territory of Turkey from being ovenrun by Russia we laid down no principles, we undertook no obligations which could prevent us from speaking and thinking of Turkey as she really is. It cannot be supposed that the exhausting war in which she has been engaged for two years and a quarter can have strengthened her decaying institutions or breathed into her exhausted frame that national spirit and energy which has so long and so gradually been ebbing away. Tf to accelerate the inevitable revolution in Eastern Europe was the object of Russia, that object she will doubtless have obtained, nor is it in our power to prevent her; but it is in our power to provide that from this revolution, whenever it takes place, Russia, at any rate, shall gain nothing. We cannot re-create the Turkish nation, but we can preserve and defend the Turkish territory. This, however, can only be done by a firm and straightforward policy, by placing the power in hands that can use it, instead of neutralizing or surrendering the power by reposing it in hands that cannot. If Russia is to be kept out of Constantinople, her ships of war must be 'kept out of the Black Sea; and, if her ahips of war are to be kept out of the Black Sea, the treaties that insure its neutrality must be in other hands than those of the Turkish * The following statement of the very terms publshed in the Nord appeared in lie Tinmes of December 20:- " You will perhaps be surprised to hear that Russia has been beforehand with us, andhas herself nadea proposition, to wrhich, as it has the priority, that carried by SComit lRs r2azvmu st be considered a counter-proposition. A fewr days since Prince GTOxrSCrrxor waited on Count Buox., and with much emphasis delivered a proposal which he declared must certainly render the further prosecution of the war impossible. How he could have done go with a grave face it is difficult to imagine. He proposed that the oDnferences of last year should be renewed at the point where they left ofl; declared that his Imperial master no longer opposed the neutralization of the Black Sea, and pro- eeded o explain a Plan for effecting this object which has certainly the merit of novelty. RE proposed that ship of sar of al nations should be exclud6d from thsBlack Sea, eccpt those of Russia and Turkey ;and tht it should be left to these two Powers to decide upon the amount of force which each required. What answer Count lBUOL gave to this xtrange proposal-wht,er he treated it as a bad joke or notI am unable t:o say, but at least he trananitted the schemne, sindutybound, toFrance and England, whahadx*#i~culty i~fr~wingsv~r Divan. - Better to fight for A complete and satisfactory peace than to obtain its terms in namee.but lose them in reality by intristing the care of their observance to hands which, we well know, will never dare to enforced them.
Foreigners are somewhat imaginative in attributing to England a deep and vigilant policy. There are few even among the educated of France and Germany who do not believe that England, never hasting but never resting, is intent upon the development of her empire and commerce in both worlds. It is particularly with regard to our Indian empire that the world is admiringly suspicious. The rise and progress of that great dominion, its strange foundation by a company of merchants, the wealth of the conquered countries, their distance from the land of the victorious race, and the fact that what has been gained by the sword can only be preserved by incessant watchfulness and unfailing energy, all tend to raise the wonder of strangers and to give birth to the idea of some singular Machiavellian policy. But we at home know with how little wisdom our part of the world is governed. Englishmen have blundered on to greatness in the East, as elsewhere. No conquest can be said to have been pLannedprovince after province has been added to the empire with unwillingness, and as if in obedience to fatality. At last we have gained seemingly the natural bounds of dominion. AU that the world has been accustomed to call India is now virtually under the British sceptre. The morasses of Burmah bound it to the East; its opposite frontier is now on the Indus, beyond which are narrow passes, sterile country, and tribes seemingly untameable. Of late a deadly contest nearer home has drawn away attention from the remoter East, but, as far as men's minds recurred to it, there was a notion that the phase of conquest had passed away, and that the absorption of the protected States, the civilization of the people, and the material improvements which can alone effect the change, were the first duties of a Governor-General. Now, however, it is proved once more how little the wishes and resolves of a nation can direct its course. An event has occurred which demands the interposition of the British Government, and, should a recourse to arms be necessary, it is the Indian Viceroyalty which must direct the machine of war. Herat has been taken by the Persians. The name of this city, which lies on the road from the Caspian to the Indus, has been for many years faniliar to Indian politicians. Lying on the northeastern frontier of Persia, its Sultan, though independent, must always be influenced by his more powerful neighbour. The fate of this city would be nothing to us if we believed that Persia itself was a Power free and unconstrained. But the situation of the second great Mahomedan monarchy must give disquiet even to the most sanguine politician. The religious feud which divides the Persians from the Turks on the one side, and from the Affghans and Indian Mahomedans on the other, is well known. It is also notorious that the Persian monarchy is feeble and corrupt even beyond the usual degradation of the East. Russia has understood how to turn to account both the prejudices and venality of the Persian Court. Although Persia has had many wars with her powerful neighbour, and has been plundered of more than one province, yet the SHAH looks to St. Petersburg not only with fear, but with a kind of cringing attachment. The increase of the Russian naval force on the Caspian was contested by Persia in days gone by, but such resolution is no more. The efforts which Russia is now making for the defence of her Transcaucasian provinces are, we doubt not, aided by the Court of Teheran to the ful limits of its power. Astrabad, on the Persian coast, has long been a Russian station, and may be considered almost a possession of the CzAR. All the Persian trading vessels will be used to carry shell and powder from Astrachan to Baku. The recent faU of Rars will, no doubt, increase the power and reputation of the CZAR in Central Asia. Situated near the Persian frontier, and on the line of the caravans, its name is well known throughout a vast region, which wil now forget whatever it had heard of the fall of Sebastopol. This is the moment that we hear of a successful attack on a bulwark of our empire by a potentate who obeys only the instigations of our enemy. Now, there is no need of hasty action under the influence of unfounded alarm. A march from the Volga to the Indus was looked upon as a dream by sensible men long before this war began, and the results of the present contest have dispelled any fears that were based on the supposed greatness of Russian resources, and the power of that empire for foreign conquest. It is, perhaps, rather a fortunate coincidence which draws the attention of the British people to Persian subserviency-and intrigue at a time when aU the relations between Russia and the civilized world are in a state of transition. The Sn&A has emerged from the neutrality which he affected; he has committed an act which, justly or not, the CzAa looks on as a benefit to himself and a blow to British domination; but it may prove that in choosing this moment of action the Cz&X and his vassal have greatly erred. We have, if we wish it, an opportunity of dealing shortly with this ignorant and vacillating State. We may, while the general question of the East is debated by Europe, fir for ourselves the future relations of Central Asia, and put an end to even the wildesthopes of Russian ambition or continental ill-wilL Persia has now shown herself to be actively the instrument of a Power unfriendly to us. It is therefore within our just rights to interfere with moderation of tone, but determination of purpose. It has, perhaps, been a misfortune that hitherto Persia has been treated with rather too directly by the British Cabinet. The concerns of Central Asia have been dependent on the Foreign-office, whose chiefs and agents are little acquainted with Eastern notions, and are only indirectly in correspondence with the Govemment which wields the largest and readiest force. It seems to us that British diplomacy in Persia should be directed rather from Calcutta than from London. The territory of the Sna- belongs politically to the same category as Affghanistan or the Punjab before its conquest. The Persian knows only two great potentates-Russia and the Governor-General. Inanycase, however, it is tothe Indian Government that we must look, should the zremonstrances of our representative require support. The Governor-General wields a power which as yet has never been fully tested. The armies of the three presidencies are reckoned by hundreds of thousands of men. The port of Bombay is within a fortnight's sail of fthe Persian shores. Means of sea transport exist suffi- ecient for the rapid conveyance of troops by a nation which has absolute command of the Eastern waters. In a short timeBushire might be occupied by a force which would at least cause Persia to pause. It is certainly the case thet the southern provinces which border on the Gulf are of little value, and are hardly regarded by the Persian Court. Bushire is separated from Teheran by a difficult country, thinly inhabited by a race which the Persian Sovereign and -his nobles disdain. Were Russia able to give any assistance to her vassal, we believe that something. niore, than the occupation of Busisire would be neoessaqy to give weight to our represntations But, as things are, it is probable that any ig of poweor- ad det%wino on our pa$iwould be sufficient to make the Court of Teheran relapse into at least the semblance. of neutrality, and to make substantial reparation by restoring "the " gate of India" to an independent SoTereign. The present Sultan of HEIiAT is said to be a drunkaid and a covard, and it would be advisable that so important a charge should be committed to abler hands. If not strong enough to stand alone, it rnight be annexed to the Affghall dominion by a treaty to 'which England should be a contracting Power. It would be well that, now an occasion has arisen, the whole question of Central Asia should be considered and discussed. We have gone to war to insure the peace of the world by the integrity of the Ottoman State; thero can be no harn that we should also demand that the domination of the CzAR should cease to be extended at the expense of Persia, and even of the Central Asiatic- despotisms. They deserve little at our hands, and it is not for their sakes that we interfere, but for the sake of general peace and the principle 6f resistance to lawless power. WVe trust soon to aee the earmeit remonstrances of the British Minister supported by the full authority of the now Governor-General, and by the vhole of that military organization of Which the world has heard so much.
lNext to the peculiarities of our climate, there is no subject on which the mass of the community are so alive as the difficulty of getting a good article on reasonable terms. No wonder, then, that the letters we have recently inserted on the deficiencies and the dishonesties oi British manufacture have met a general response. Is it impossible to combine cheapness and goodness ? The Duke of naraIIoroN, in an address to the noncommissioned officers of his army at the close of the war on the investment of their savings, said, " Remember, high interest is only another name " for bad security." Biut in the matter of buying and selling, even a low interest-that is, a high price, is no security for the goodness of an article. Millionnaires complain, with the rest, that when they have given an order without limitation of price a costly work is spoilt by vulgarity of design, by inferiority of material, or unsoundness of construction. Everybody must recollect the casket exhibited in the nave of the Exhibition in fHyde Park, ordered by a wealtly nobleman to be as good as British art could do it, at we are afraid to say how many thousand pounds, and anything more rubbishy than the result cannot be imaginsd. Go into any of our great houses, and you will have a surfeit of decoration; but something or other everywhere betrays that the principal foreman of Messs. So and So has taken orders for all you see, and that his chief rule of taste was the length of the bill. But, if this is the fate of millionnaires, who can help themselves, and whom, therefore, one need not pity, what must .become of small people, compelled to mar their -sthetical impressions with sums in mental arithmetic? What must become of the great mass, who, with the humblest means, must first clothe and feed and house themselves; and then, perhaps, disguise or solace their poverty ? Very lately the whole London world was scared by the frightful disclosure of adulterations in every article of food, drink, or physic. The defence of the adulterators is the old one,-Popuqus vnat dtcipi et decipiatur. The political economy of the tondoieI is comprised in the cheapest market. Of course, they who buy cheap will produce cheap ; and even their own knowledge of the arts by which price is kept down does not deter them from running into the snare when laid by another. So long as all this is among ourselves, and we do it, even when we understand it, there seems no help for it, nor is it help that is required. As a matter ef common sense we should certainly advise people to select good shops, to stick to them, to be content to pay a good price, to confine their own tastes and desires within moderate limits, and to prefer a few good things to a great number of bad things. But this is a matter of common sense, and all the telling, and writing ix the world won!t drive it into silly people. Health, indeed, is a public affair, and if, as is alleged, the health of multitudes is affected by adulterations, then it may be found desirable to provide some ready means of checking and exposing fraudulent dealers. The processes of analytical chymistry are so cheap when in constant application that it is a pity they should not be made accessible to the poorest class of consumers, the class most imposed upon. But it is when we come to our foreign trade that one has most reason to deplore the want of a proper spirit in our merchants and manufacturers. We are aware of the defences often made, and we are aware that both the complaint and the defence are as old as the days of the PLAxTAGmmTs, and older still. It is said that flimsy and tawdry articles are the very things wanted, and that stronger and better things would be wasted on a certain class of customers and for certain occasions. In the tropics a dress is wanted to stand for one evening, and if at the close of the :twentieth quadrille it hangs rather limp, and the colours have run, the lady is s ure to be protected from unpleasant remark by the more serious casualties of her partner's apparel. We have seen prints prepared for the South American market that seemed to want only a little warmth and moisture to melt wholly away. But our foreign markets are not a1l tropical, nor our customers all either creoles or savages. It is from our own countrymen, or from those who speak our language, that the loudest complaints come, and even our cousins and colonists inveigh against the unnatural parent that first drives them into exile and then cheats themn with bad wares. Few of our people at home have any idea of the rubbish which is sent out for the foreign market, often, of course, with the unanswerable excuse that it is the thing, wanted, and anything better would be thrown away. We export immense quantities of scissors to be sold at a penny a-pair, but they are for the vinedre5sers and grape-gatherers, and are not expected to last more than a vintage. We export knives and aU kinds of tools as cheap and with the same excuse for cheapness, the only harm being that occasionally an English customer finds he has paid a good price for an article evidently made for a savage. As for boots and shoes, we have heard from colonial people that it is absolutely impossible to buy them wearable and strong even at an extravagant price, and they say " Send us your old shoes, for they are better " than we can buy here." Of course, the custom of selling freights by auction immediately on the ship's arrival must be a protection to inferiority. Where *the fault lies it is hard to say. The manufacturers complain of long crecit, the shippers of large expenses, hazardous consignments, and small returnas; while the colonial public complain that-the invoides are " dressed" and the goods only more or less indifferent. One might have thought that, inasmuch as there are honest makers, honest conveyeri, honest sellers, and honest buyers, it was only required to put them into communication ; but thait evidently is too near an approaclito millennial confidence. As, however, tae evil is only disovered in the colony, it is the.e that the remedy must be found.. Nobody at~ home can save the colonist from imposition irl an aa9icle which never sees the light from the.time it leaves the factory to the .momentr trbhn it is plced in-his own hands. 4A Tor &one.-of the pointi enulnerated by Aa cvs! ia li 1Im letter- w4 mUy riwag expect to be beaten by our neighbours, and Biit |doW content under that defeat. He says,- "It appears, from the communicatfons of my carrespondents, that not only are we beaten by our neighbours in the iron manufactures as I myself affiined,-not only hare the Fench made rapid strides towards our excellence in the heavier departwaents of the mechanical arts, such as engine and toot malding, and ruaintained their acknowledged supenority in philomophical apparatus and what are called instruments of precision,-but in steel manufacture and its numberless applications which we recognize as -SheEeld wares, in tho very important mannhcture of WDollen cloths, in merinoes, in silks, in dyeing, in cabixaet ork and ep holstery, in boots and shoes, in gloves, in book printing " boo'kbinding, inpsperhanging, and tho decorative as generally, in bronzes, in jewelry and ornament; in fact, in a much longer list which I could make of articles which show the application of the arts to the wants, the conveniences, and the elegancies of life, our continental neighbours of one country or another are undoubtedly before us. Eere, then, is a list of ourshortcomings." Now, there can be no reason, no excuse, for losing a superiority once acquired, and in some of these articles we ought still to stand at the head of the world. With regard to others, it may be conceded that if a British manufacturer can get an article cheaper from France than he can possibly make it he is not to be called upon to ruin himself for the idle boast of making it on British soil. French and German artisans have some points of superiority to the British on which they must continue to have the advantage. Goodnes, however, as well a3 cheapness, is not a fixed, but an advancing point. It is a race between different countries, and if we sit down content with a second place we shall soon find that second a tlird, and eventually be distanced altogether. What may be done under the pressure of necessity and with the fear of defeat is proved by the vast improvement noticed by our correspondent in our arsenals and other establishments for preparing and furnishing the materials of war. "It will be cheering," he truly says, " to the country at large to know that w"e have now an arsenal fit to be a model for "the world." We have been slowly arriving at 'this happy result, and it may be still longer I before our army and navy are so constituted as to make tho best use of the unequaUed means now placed at their command, But this is only a question of time. Our manufacturers have to see to it that private enterprise keeps pace with public; and that Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, aheffield, and the other hives of peaceful industry are not beaten by the gloomy workshops of war. Of one thing we are very sure-that no trade wil ever prosper unless there be found men to take a pride in it, and to feel themselves more ennobled by doing their work well than by grasping a large share of its rewards. The one is a positive duty, the other an accident of fortune, and a generous mind will not hesitate which to choose.
It has been long felt that all the suggestions which have been made for the promotion of legal education have been merely palliatives; the full and complete remedy had yet to be discovered and applied. Now, such a remedy the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the arrangements in the Inns of Court and Chancery thinkl they have hit upoII at last,-it is, in a word, the application of the University system to the training for the Bar. In the same waythat Christ Church, Trinity, St. Johnr's, are academic Colleges, so Lincoln'sinn, the two Temples, and Gray's-innwouldbe legal Colleges. In the same way that the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge areconibined into uniformity of action by the intervention of a governing body, and collectively receive the name of a University, so would the various Inns of Court and Chancery be combined, at least forthe purposes of legal education, into a legal University. This new and important body would have its Chancellor elected for life, its Vice-Chancellor, and its Senate. The Senate would consist of eight members elected from each Inn of Court, five of whom, benchers, elected by ben6hers, would represent the aristocratic element of the profession, and three barristers, elected by barristers, would represent the views and feelings of the general body of the Bar. This is, in fact, to throw the regimen of this new University into the hands of the benchers, as upon any point of difference they would divide as 20 against 12. Whether this be a wise regulation or not we will not now stop to inquire-such is the proposal of the Commissioners. There can be little doubt that in times to come this little legal Senate will draw into its hands ampler dominion over the profession; it is therefore most desirable that the wisest conditions for its constitution should be carefully weighed and ascertained. Let the foundations be carefully considered for this is a buiding which should last for many a long year. As yet the Commissioners do not propose that the jurisdiction of their new University should extend beyond the incidence of forensic education. In point of fact, they lay it dowvn distinctly in their twenty-first proposition that the Inns of Court shall not be compelled to call to the Bar even the students who have passed the ordeal of the University examinations. The Iuns are to retain their former powers, not only as to the admission of students, but even as to the disbarring of them after examination, subject to appeal to the Judges. As far as admission is concerned this proviso would necessarily be a dead letter, save in the caae of enormous and notorious immorality. With regard to the disbarring of members of the Bar, the powers exercised at present by the benchers might with advantage be reviewed. The appeal to the Judges has practically been found of little avail; it is so encompassed with doubts and uncertainties, and the Judges are so reluctant to move, that the powers of the benchers in the various Imns of Court amount to despotic authority. This, however, is beside the main question for the moment, which is, " How are our barristers " to be educated T' The answer given by the Commissioners is this -Their legal University will appoint regular examiners, who will organize a preliminary examination of candidates for admission as students. After this will follow- a more serious examination, or series of examinations, which every person who is desirous of being called to the Bar, or of attaining the degree of Master of Laws, naust of necessity pass. The needful knowledge is divided into two branches. The first is to comprise constitutional law and legal history, jurisprudence and Roman law. The second embraces as subjects the common law, equity, and the law of real property. A pass or certificate for cal to the Bar may be obtained by passingone subject in each branch. The candidates for honours and for the higher degree of Master of Laws mrust resolve to grapple with the full difficulties of the subjects enunciated above. TEhere is to be one studentship wortl 501. per annum, retainable for four yeas, to awose the emulation anad tempt the ambitionof the studenrt. Forfurtherparticulars of the propositions of the Commissioners we must refer to the abstract of their report, which will be found in another portion of our columns this diy. Suffice it for the moment to say that here is the University system of education imported into the metropolis, and applied to the'study of the law. Without pledging ourselves to an opinion upon any single question of daetail, we hasten to record our wannest apprwal- of the general principle. It is a f act that our two great Universities do every year tuir out good miatliematicims and asicla scholars; it is another fact that the Innr X Court in Londzia hxve JIdtho either uot giyeu aty leI taducation it a1- or it hl boca 4. a per2nlsslvncharacteras" to amount to anj4* - How can we expect to have a suocersion of goodl lawyers if we will not be at the pains of *ainiajthem 7 any reproacheslave been showerel, and; with perfect justice, upon our system. of Laws i-i England. They are illiberal, they are ill'gcal they are patchwork, they are out of date; they axea maw of frivolous formuke and tiresome I ecbni^j calities, The question is, who is to make themn better? It is in vain for a layman to ventare - upon the t3sk, for all the owls, batE, and. spiders Of Wesminster-hall will do their worst upon him if he dare to invade their _hol,t precincts witlithe faintest corner of a duster7iiible beneath his coat-sleeve. Are we to look for assist-. auce to the lawyers themselves7 They arc maen: who have been educated in two ways. They have been shut up for a, couple of yearsor more in the chambers of pleaders or conveyancers, with no higher objects of study th:ii tha draughts of pleas and conveyances which ;t wis their duty to copy and re-copy ustq ad MUOMeaMn. When well saturated with these aboriinable formza the aspiring young lawyer puts on his wig and gown, and for a time in the back robws cf the: courts at Westminster imbibes more legal know- ledge from the lips of the Judges,-in other irords, - le learns to do just what his predecessors had done before him. It is obvious that from such a manlittle can be expected for the improvement of our laws. We have hitherto been employed in tikerig away at our laws aS best we could overcome the 'e- sistance of the profession. From the moment that's ' sound system of legal education is at work w3 shall fnd our task all the lighter. We train up wormen - fit for the work which an enlightened eommlunity has a right to expct at their hands. TheL Bar hitherto has been rather an iliberal than a liberal profession. There has been plenty of hair-splitting, - plenty of acuteness in cross-exaninaticn, :md of. sharp practice not a little; but, with the exception - of half-a-dozen great Judges and advocates, our lawyers have been rather behind thaun before the great mass of the educated comnmunity. Another advantage which will probalbly follow from the system of publc examninations and public honours in law wvil be that it will ha-e a te-adency to diminish the evils of nepotism and attorney favour. Attorneys are often enough nnjustly blamed for preferring their own profus to strangers; but how are they to select from among the younger banisters in the back rowE. the men who are really most likely to do theu, geod service? Surely the " Senior Wrangler" in law will have a chance given him at a far earlier per.iod than the mute, inglorious X&wsFmr.Ds, who have pined and died in obscuity under the present system.

SECOND EDITION. l:THE TIMES OFFICE, Thuirsda1 3oraig. - EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The followring is the letter of our Paris correeipondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - 'A private letter from Constantinople, dated the 24th, mentions as follows- "The measures of order and police follow their course at lamiesch, kadikoi, and Balaklava. In the two latter places an order has bcen published for the closing of all shops at 4 *eclock p.m. precisely. AUn buyers maust also quit the ba=ar at the same hour. The delinquents, whether sellers or tmayers, ire made responsible for every infraction of this leeasure under a severe penalty. A passport office has been etablished a. Balaklax-a, in order to place on a regular foottng the position of the inhabitants of the town who arenot sailitary. All passports wDl be tri.<d there, and the English 3iaval authorites have undertaken the execution of all the formalities." The Britishl war steamer Caradoc arrived at Marteilles on th.e 30th ult., from Constantinople, which 'he left on the 23d. Sir Edmund Lyons, Admiralh-Chief of the Eng'iish Blaclk Sea squadron, and General La Mlarmora, Commander-in-Chief of the Sardinian army, came passengers in that vessel, and took their departure for Paris the next morning. fThe Caradoc will, no doubt, await the return of those two personages to convey them to MIalta, thence they will proceed to the Crimea on board the Rtoyal Albert. The Consuls of England and Sardinia accompanied Sir Edmund Lyons and General La Marmora to the railway station. The 39th Regiment of the line and two detachments of the 20th and 50th, left Marseilles, by raflway, for Paris on the 31st ult. We read in the ll&obrcher, of Algiers:- "The Governor-General has remarked with satisfaction the proofs of devotion given by the tribe of Benni Djenuad, vho had not only rasisted all-attempts to create disorder, lbtt had furnished niany recruits to the regiment of native sharpshooters. In his desire to testify his satisfaction, the Governor-General has permitted the members of the Benni Djennad to frequent all the fairs of Algeria, whilst permits oE travelling will be distributed to them gratuitously. Other subjected tribes (12 in number) have, on the contrary, been refused permission to frequent the fairs in question." The Ar"ioricain, of Brest, says - " Our port is every day displaying greater acivity.

When Austria and the Western Powers agreed on the conditions of peace which were to be forwarded to St. Petersburg, the former promised not to comInunicate them to any of the other Powers until after they had reached their destination, and it affords me pleasure to be able to state that the promise was religiously kept. As you have alreadybeen informed, Count Valentine Esterhazy reached St. Petersburg an Wednesday, the 26th, and communicated the conditions of peace to the St. Petersburg Cabinet on the following day. On the 28th, Count Buol communicated to Prince Gortschakoff the terms on which the Western Powers were willing to concluide peace, and he at the same time declared that they had been made with the full know ledge and consent of Austria. As was said in a previous letter, the conditions are those mentioned in the first leader of The Ti7 C of the 12th. It is foreseen that the third of the five conditions will lead to a tremendous storm at St. Petersburg, as it defacto deprives Russia of a great part of the advantages which she obtained by the treaty of peace concluded at Bucharest in the year 1812. In the leader above aluded to it is said, " Austria proposes that Russia shall cede so much of the territory of Bessarabia as is necessary to secure to all nations the iree navigation of the Danube ;" and the meaning of this is, that Russia is required to cede all the territory lying between the fortress of Chotym, in the north, of the Sasik or Salt Sea in the south, and of the Prnth in the west. By the fourth article of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Porte ceded to Russia about one-third of Mloldavia-including the fortresses of Chotym, Ismail, and Kilia ; and this must now be returned to its original proprietor. By the treaty in question Russia also obtained the whole of the province of Bessarabia, and a glance at the map will serve to convince you that the Dniester ought to form the limit between Russia and European Turkey, for if Russia should accept the propositions now made there will only be a "dry" frontier between the Russian province of Bessarabia and Moldavia. A few days since His Majesty the Emperor Francis Joseph, forwarded autograph letters to the Kings of Prussia and Bavaria, in which he communicated to them the propositions which had been forwarded by Austria to the Russian Govermment. It is believed that they (the propositions) wil be supported by King Maximilian, but it is positively known that they have not met with the approbation of his Prussian Majesty. Apartments have been kept for Colonel Mffanteuffel at the " Archduke Charles" hotel since Thursday last, but it is supposed that he has been detained at Dresden or has received counter orders from his Royal MBaster. It is possible that the Emperor has also written to the King of Saxony, but no positive information has reached me on the subject. The representatives of England and France speak in very high terms of the straightforward and honourable conduct of this Government, and feel convinced that Austria wiUl immediately "break off" her diplomatic relations with Russia if the conditions of peace, of which Count Esterhazy was the bearer, should be rejected. It must be understood that my informant employed the word rompre (to break off) and not ulendre (to suspend). It need hardly be said that the foregoing statement deserves implicit confidence. A Vienna correspondent of the Frankfiort Post Zeihungwrites as folows:- "The assertion of the JournaZ de Dresde that Russia is willing to agree to the neutralization of the Black Sea, under certain conditions, wi produce no effect, as the Western T'owers and Austria demand from Russia a simple accept- .nce or a simple, rejection of their propositions. A condiftionalaoceptane Will be considered equivalent to a rejection. The best proof that the December allies are-should it be necessary-resolved to enforce peace is, that they are already agreeing on the measures to be tiken if their pro- positions should be reiected. It may be added that the arigOtiationson the subiect are progresiung to the satisfytlon Of all parties ' ." My political friends take a great deal tf trouble to consvicemethatmy judgment is at flalt, but itis still my firmbelief thAt Austr Mia itD be a participator in the wvar next Sprinlg, tn1esshe can previously obtain from theBund a promise of support. It must, however, be remarked that if she could calculate on the assistance of Bavaria, Saxony, and the smaler German States she might possibly be induced to bid defiance to Russia. Help from Prussia Austria does not expect, as she knows full well that King Frederic William is completely in the hands of Russia. We learn fronm St. Petersburg that the conduct of the Mussulman population on the banks of the Volga gives some uneasiness to the Russian Governmnent. Many Mussulmans have been arrested and sent to Siberia. We are also told that there is considerable excitement in Finnland, and it appears probable that such is realy the case, as the Russian Government has refused to permit any of the Finnish families to go to Sweden to pass the winter. The Emperor Alexander II. has ordered a special Court to be formed at Kieff for trying captured Poles and Hungarians. The former are to be punished according to the military law of the country, but the latter are to be delivered over to the Austrian authorities. So many Poliish and Hungarian prisoners are taken-in irons-to Kieff, that no fewer than four judges and 10 secretaries are continually employed. The publication of the Austro-Roman Concordat was prohibited in Russian Poland. The text of the Concordat was published at Naples in the official Gazette, with the exception of the paragraph relative to the abolition of the placdtei t 'egiwu. There will be a grand ceremony on Tuesday next in the Church attached to the Imperial Palace. The Eniperor has undertaken to place the Cardinals hat on the head of the Archbishop of Vienna, and invitations have been sent to aU the Chamberlains to attend. The Oesterreichische Zeitut,ng has received the following letter:- " ODESSA, DEC. 21. "For some days past our roads hav-e been frozen over to a distance of two versts from the coast. In the steppe the thermometer yesterday showed 25 deg. below zero of Reaumur's scale (24.25 Fahrenheit). On the same day, the 14th and 1th infantry divisions were on their march from SebastopoL No lives were lost, but some of the men's noses, ears, and cheeks were frozen. The march of troops towards Bessarabia continually increases; but there can be noquestion of an evacuation of the Crimea, as militia, guards, and reserves take the place of the battalions which leave that peninsula. It is rumoured that Prince Gortschakoff will leave the Crimea, and take the command of tne army on the Danube. Adjutant-General Osten-Sacken is mentioned as the successor of Prince Gortschakoff. The few gunboats left off Kinbumrn are frozen in, andtheattemptsto free them from the ice by means of artillery have completely failed." The first meeting of the Administrative Council of the Credit and Commercial Bank ii to take place to-day. The President of the Council is to be elected, and it is believed that the choice will fall on Prince Schwarzenberg. The shares of the Company are now at a premium of 10 and 11 per cent. The Oesterreichisqc7e Correspo&denz brings article after article in defence of the proposed law in favour of free competition in trade. The Vienna papers are one and aU in favour of the measure, but the various guilds offer vigorous opposition, and threaten to petition the Emperor to order his Minister of Commerce to relinquish a plan which, in their opinion, "nwiU be the ruin of the country." Yesterday there was a very warm discussion on the subject in the Chamber of Trade of Vienna, and one of the advocates of free competition wound up his discourse by saying that no Government ought to hesitate to sac-ifice the interests of single individuals to the welfare of the milion. Meyerbeer's ltoie du Nord was given yesterday for the first time, and met with " prodigious" suCcess. The pieces which were already. known to the public from the opera of Vidka were the overture, three airs in the first and second acts, the conspiracy chorus, wvith a part of the finale in the second act, and the famous " flute air" in the third act. The solo parts were- better given in London and Paris, but the choruses and marches were perfect. The maestro, who was obliged to appear on the stage some 15 or 20 times, was vociferously applauded. The two Montenegrins, who robbed the Austrian Lieutenant close to his post on the frontiers, have been shot in obedience to the sentence passed by the Senate. The Fremde7 Blatt learns from Varna that the Russian General Susloff took possession of the defiles of Hassan-Kaleh as soon as Selim Pasha retreated to Erzeroum. The Cossacks, under Colonel Korsakoff, have already been seen on the plateau of Erzeroum. The gros of the Russian army will pass the winter at Kars. PRUSSIA. (FROMt OU OWN CORRESONDENr.) BERLIN, JTA-. L As I wrote to you yesterday, Colonel von Manteuffel left here on Monday (yesterday) for Dresden, whence he is to go on to Vienna, bearing with him an autog,,raph letter from the King to the Emperor In answer to his to the King requesting him to support the Austrian proposals in St. Petersburg. 3everal Austrian papers have already expressed their ioy that Count George Esterhazy should have suceeded in prevailing on the King to back the said proposals in St. Petersburg with aU his influence as i relative and his power as a neighbouring monarch; others, who have had the cue given them by the result actually attained, deny that Austria has called upon Prussia to back her proposals, but only begged her to support the general cause of peace, as she has done already over and over again. If the latter was the request made it has doubtless been fulfilled or will be shortly ; if the former, it has no chance at aU of meeting with willing ears and ready hands. Men in office here say, " Why should we identify ourselves with proposals that Austria has drawn up for her own benefit, and got the consent of the Western Powers to, without our particination ? As long -as we are treated in this manner we have no call to move a step furtherforward." It is not however to be imagined that they would move many if Prussia were ever so courteously treated. I still believe that what I wrote to you as my own conjecture a few days back will turn out to be very near the mark, viz.: that Prussia will advocate peace again and in general terms, perhaps a little more urgently than hitherto, but will neither back Austria's proposals as such, nor hold out any threatening alternative or the appearance of one. In a great many papers one may read every day that the Kinghas already done aU manner of things in connexion with this subject. "H e would, he ivould not,-I know not what." I can only say, for the information 6l these very far-sighted politicians, that at present nothing in the way of a com- munication to the Court of St. Petersburg has been 1 made from here since Count George Esterhazys audience of the King, December 201i, and I shall not be munch srprised if the despatel- now in question be not drawn uip at aU until after Colonel von Manteuffel's return from Vienna. It may be that its tenour will be infl-uenced by what the learns at that Court; every good Prussian, however, would scout the idea of Prussia's policy being in any way influenced by Austria's actions (but such is not the case, it is goierally influenced- to go in the opposite direction); and I am inclined to believe that his visit to the Court of Dresden has much more to do withthefuture intonation of the despatch than the information he wil gain in Vienna. The activity shown by Saxony in permitting her Minister at Paris to travel about to St. Petersburg and elsewhere implies something like an inclination to -do something on her own account apart from Ptimia,with wjhom she has beesA hitherto allbut iden.- tified; ThiColonel'svisitto Dresden,whichwl pe'rhaps be extended to .*Munih,.will have for ita obja6t to ascertain how far these two Powers, Saxony and Bavaria, are thinking of deviating from the policy hitherto observed, and to use all persuasion to prevail onthem to "stand in the old ways." Colonelvon Manteuffel arrived in Dresden yesterday forenoon, had an audience of the King, dined at the Royal table, and left the Saxon capital in the evening for Vienna. That the exertions of the Baron von Seebach at St. Petersburg were not looked upon as particalarly favourable to the Austrian proposals or d6mrches may be seen by the querulence with which the Austrians ask why Baron Seebach travelled to St. Petersburg by way of Berlin and not by way of Vienna? Prince Labanoff, who was sent off from here by the Russian Embassy with despatches the same day as Count George Esterhazy had his audience here of the King, arrived in Warsaw on the 27th nlt. RUSSIA. (FROM OUR BERLIJ xCORPSPODXENTj. BERLIN, J.x 1. The Emperor's Flugel-Adjutant Admiral Prince MIenschikoff has been, by an Imperial order, nominated Military Governor-General of Cronstadt, with all the rights, power, and honours due to the Com- mander-in-Chief of an army in time of war. Al the, land and sea forces in Cronstadt are put under his command, and he retains al his present offices. The report has been current for some time past in St. Petersburg that a military command on the shores of the Baltic would soon be conferred on the Prince, but everybody was of opinion that he would not permit himself to be drawn again from his retirement. The presence in St. Petersburg of the various " heroes of Sebastopol," as they are called there, Generals Todtleben, Wassilatchikoff, Ourousoff, and Novossilski have given rise to a variety of ovations. In addition to the nomination of Menschikoff, we find in the Russian papers a letter of thanks addressed by the Emperor to General Mouravieff, as follows:- " The immovable firmness, the exemplary fortitude, and the strategical circumspection which have characterized all your actions in Asiatic Turkey, are now crowned with. 2erfect success. The proud keepof AsiaMinor, the fortress of Kars, has surrendered, with its whole garrison, its artillery, and its extenSive dp6ts of arms. The Anatolian army, 30,000 men strong, exists no more; and its Commander-inChief, Mushir Vassif Pasha, is our prisoner. I thank you heartily for this glorious achievement, which has covered the Rusian flag with new fame. I give it you in commission to express my sincerest thankrs to the troops under your command, whose firmness and courage have overcome the most obstinat4defence of the enemy. In recognition of your praiseworthy' merits I make you herewith Knight of the Grand Cross of St. George, 2d Class, to which you have earned an indisputable right, and I remain, in all Imperial favour, "Your well affected, "AJEXANDER." Count Kleinmichel, the late Minister of Public Works, now that he has retired from the Imperial service, is the object of innumerable lampoons, satires, and scurrilous anonymous attacks, imputing to him enormous embezzlements. He was a member of the German party, and it happens, unfortunately for him, just at the time of his retirement, that most of the high officers, such as Admiral von Berch and Commander Mferder, 'who have lately been removed from office on account of " irregularities," discovered in the depots and arsenals of Nicholaieff, belong to the same party, and are for the most part of German extraction. In the place of every one of the Gernans displaced there comes some thorough Russian or other, such as Tschevkin and Metlin, to the great satisfaction of the Russian party. The Minister of the Interior, Lansko4, has also received at the hands of the Emperor a great extension of his power and influence, by the removal of the restriction which had been imposed by the late Emperor on the number of unpaid attachgs in the civil service. It has long been the custom for the sons of the nobility, with a view to avoiding the tedious service from the lowest rank ulpvards, to apply on leaving the public schools or universities after attaining the 14th or 12th class (in the State), to be admitted as Tschinlowniki dla osoby3ch po-utsche-, or officials for special purposes; as such they are attached, though witlhout pay, to the Bureaux and public offices, and after attaining to a higher class, say the 8th or 6th, either by seniority or good services or patronage, they step into some good office or other corresponding to the class they have attained. The appointments and promotions of these aftalus is entirely in the hands of the Minister, who belongs to an old Russian family, and of whom it may be expected that his interest will be extended cliiefly to the scions of the old Russian nobility. In the meantime financial matters become more and more embarrassing; there have been reports sent in to the Government which show that in spite of the strict sur'veiMlai2e exercised at the frontiers the smuggling of specie out of the country is being organized as a regular and lucrative trade: it-is stated that the smugglers earn no less than 4 per cent. for all roubles or imperials they can convey out of the colntry from the exporters, and an equal amount from the receivers. The long-existing smuggling of tea and similar articles of considerable value and small bulk seems to have trained a numerous population to this lucrative trade. The disappearance of gold and silver from circulation becomes more and more evident and embarrassing; it is probably with a view to increaring the circulation in a manner that shall not tempt the smugglers to carry it off, that, as we learn by telegraph from St. Petersburg, the Minister of Finance has just ordered copper money to be coined to the extent of three millions of silver roubles, although the coinage of a similar amount in copper has only just been completed. The prices of saltpetre continue to rise beyond all calculation and control; all restrictions have been removed from its production in Russia, and the Government has offered high prices to be paid in ready money for almost unlimited quantities. The supply has remained, however, totaily insufficient; the Government seems not to have been able to resolve to make any further inroads in the extensive tariff by any diminution of the duty in its favour, but nevertheless it is now generally understood that the various Custom-houses on the frontiers have received instructions sub osa to admit saltpetre free of all duty; Russian accounts say that this manceuvre has already been of considerable use. The Committee that has been appointed by the Grand Duke Constantine to sit in Nicholaieff to assess the indemnification to be paid for injury to, or loss of property in, Sebastopol, finds it no easy task, the more so as the whole business is required to be finished within a year. There have already been various supplementary instsuctions issued on the subject; astnatters stand at presentall disputed ,questions of property are suspended, and all payments are postponed, until the points in conflict have been arranged.

THE COMING EXAfIfATIOrN FOR APPOINTMENTSIN THE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS. TO THE EDITOiOF THE TTaS. Sir,-I hope you will allow me, through the medium of yourcolumns, to correct amisapprehensionwhich is believed to.exist on the subject of the approaching examination for artillery and engineer commissions, and one which may tend to deter several persons from becoming candidates. The high marks assigned to mathematics are said to have led to an idea in Oxford, and in some of the public schools, that none but mathematicians are likely to succeed. But this, however natural on first appearances, is an entire mistake; and a short statement may be desirable, in order to show persons interested in the subject that it isso. It was, no donbt, the intention of the committee who fixed the marks to give a decided advantage to good mathematicians. But of such persons, " owing to the present unjust neglect of mathematics" (I quote from Mr. bloseley's report), very few seem likely to make their appearance. At the last examination there were not ten such; and at the present, suposmg these 10 to be increased to 20, there wil still remain places out of 60 tobegained, chiefly by other kinds of merit. Ultimately, no doubt, the high marks given to mathematics may bring us a ler body of mathematicians; but some time must elapse before this is the case, and, until it is so, no good scholar (even if he can do no more than a sum in fractions or a proposition in the first book of E}uclid) ought to be afraid of taking his chance in the competition. Allow me further to press the following points- I. 1 have mentioned above that, out of 60 successful candldates at the last examination, there were only 10 whose work could be caUled tolerably good. Suppose that this time, by six months more of mathematical study, we have 20 such, and that these gain their commissions chiefly by their mathematics; still, in the remaining 40 places, the experience of the last examination would lead us to beheve that the mathematical work wvil be of so lowa character that it cannot have any great wveight, and certainly that any candidate of intelligence, who has ever learnt the smalles modicum of mathematics, might, with even a few weeks' of work, at least avoid being plucked in this part of the examination. rhis will easily be believed when I mention that out of the 60 successful candidates in last August, only 20 (besides the 10 best) were able "to work an easysum in aritbmecic, demonstrate a proposition in the f'irst book of Euclid, o2 solve an easy problem in Simple Equations." In fact 30 appointments were then obtained-and are almost as likely to be obtained now-by candidateswho hadnot even this jnj,t0nur of mathematics. 2. And, besides this, a new regulation at the present examiination diminishes the absolute necessity of mathematics almost to nothing-thus relieving good scholars from a disadvantage which was fatal to some of them on the last occasion. For then a certain positive amount of mnatlhematics was necessary, and this told so severely that out of 170 candidates 100 were actuaUy unable to compete at all from not obtaining the id2dnusnm of ten mathematical marks. This regalation is now altered, and it is only intended to strike off that one-third of the candidates which is lowest on the preliminary mathematical examination. This third consisted, on the last occasion, of some 60 candidates, nmost of whom obtained 1, 2, or 3 marks out of the 60 assined to mathematics,-units which can scarcely have representedanythming beyond the scantiest actiuaintance with Long Division or the Rule of Three. And, allowing that the standard eVen of the lowest work may be higher at the present examination, it will still probably be so low that no good scholar could fail, wvith a month or two of work, to quaify for extricating himself from this third class of "plucks." I must further remind Oxford men in particular, who are liable to be paniestricken at the very name of mathematics, that as many as 1,000 marks are given to moral and poitical hiilosophy, and 2,250 to the lautge and history of En- d and France. Classics and English taken together .amost equal the marks assigned to pure mathematics. I need not add that these remarks spring from no wish to depreciate the mathematical part of the examination, which ultimately (as being the mbst important for this branch of the servire)wi,it is hoped, predominate. I haveonlywished to point out that a good scholar has, at present,, at least, every reason toeect success, though a good mathematician is undoubtedly still more secure; and that while so little attention is paid to mathematics in most of our schools, it will be the utmost folly in scholars to shrink from the examination, under a false idea that mathematicians will be so numerous as to swalow up all the appointments. I should not have venturedto occupy so much stace in your paper, had it not been thought desirable tha t e case shoul e stated fully, for the sake of persons ihterested in the appointments to the Artillery and Engineers. I am, Sir, vour obedient servnt. Nv. '. LAKE. Ulasical Esamniner for Artillery and Engineer Appoint- ments, Fellow and Tutor of Ball ol Cole ord

. THl AMY IN THE CIMEA. CAtP BErORE SEiBASTOPOL, DiC. 21, 1855. winter is now come upon us in reality, and we 'have had for the last few days so)me very cold weather. On the night of the 18tlh the thermometer went down to eight degrees below zero in the camp of the 'Brgineers,FourthDivsion. Thi3wasbyaself-registering thermomneter. At 10 a.m. on the 9th iftas only three-degrees above zero. This is nearly, cor quite, equal to Canadian cold, and, as might be expected, a great number of men have been more or less frbstbitten. I have heard of no serious cases among our men. The French suffer a great deal from cold. The other night two rench soldiers went into one of our guardrooms in Sebastopol and asked for some coffee, andtobe allowedtowarxnthemselves bythefire. Our men gave them some coffee and biscuit, and they sat down by the fire. One of them took off his shoes (he had no stockings) and began rubbing his feet, which were frostbitten. In about 10 minutes he got up, but staggered, and fell dead, to the great horror of the English soldiers. The' other was taken care of, and was all right in the morning. The French are getting great quantities of sheepskin coats from Constantinople. To-day I met, on my way to Kmniesch, some hundreds of pack-mules with 50 coats on each, anda greatnumberof theequipiges minlitaires, also full of coats. The whole of our men are well clothed and well fed, and are in capital health and spirits. Now there is snow on the ground it is dangerous to go through the camp, as you are almost certain to get a blow on the head from a snowball, which was aimed at some one else. It is a blessing that these are the only balls we are in danger from now. Reaely the difference between this winter and last is extraordinary. Instead of the sullen, despairing lool: of ls' year, every man seems happy and contented. We have also civilized amusements going on. On every Saturday night' there is a " symposium," or sort of Cider Cellar, in the rwleauranit of the Fourth Division, composed of officers of the division, who meet at half-past 9, and have a kdnd of supper, and then sing tm 12, when the National Anthem is sung in chorus, and the meeting separates. The offices of the Fourth Division have also got up some theatricals, which they are going to act in the restafirant. They are to perform- twice, I am told, for the men-that is, for 10 or 12 men chosen froma each regiment, and twice for the officers of the division, once for each brigade. I hear the first piece is Box and Co: Matrried anzd Settled. These must be the first theatricals ever performed on Crimean soil, as I don't tllink the Tartars indulge much in that style. The Crimea is subject to new innovations every day. There is now a real, bone Jfide yellow ornii2ims in Eamiesch. If we are here much longer we may expectto be carried from camp to camp in Hansoms. There are one or two dogearts here already. We have a hunt here also-the " H. Q. P." hunt, which means the Head-quarters Paper Hunt. This is carried on in the following manner. -The fox, which is in this hunt a well-mounted man, has a quarter of an hour's law, and goes off with his pocket full of pieces of paper, one of which he drops at intervals. At the end of his quarter of an hour the field, which has consisted on the two or three neets which have taken place of nearly a hundred,go off after him, a little scattered, alllooking eagerlyon the ground for pieces of paper. The pace is very fast, and consequently the field tails considerably after a few minutes. There were a great many men out last time who had evidently hunted in avery different country, and amongthem SirW. Eyre, who was mounted on a very fine horse, and kept well ahead. There have been some very severe gales lately in the Black Sea. One or two vessels have been lost near Kamiesch. One mail, also, has neverturned up yet, and nothing has been heard of it since the iteamer left Constantinople. It is the one due on the 13th. I am told that the two mails of the 13th and 1lth left Constantinople On the same day. The 17th one arrived yesterday, but nothing has been heard of the other. There are nmmbers of " shaves" flying about the camps. Men have nothing else todo, and therefore maLe " shaves" to amuse themselves and their neighbours. I heard two extraordinary ones to-day. One of them is, that a night or two ago a Russian ouitlying picket, consisting of 120men,posted somewhere along the Tchernaya (where the " shave" did not say) came over the river, and gave themselves up to the French, as they said they were half starved, and stffered such hardships that they would rather beconie prisoners than remain where they were. The windy weather has been fatal to the hopes of many out here witlh regard to the home-made plum-puiddings that were coming out for Christmasday. The Parcels-office in Baladava is crammed every day with men eagerly asking if various vessels are in, and who generally go away disappointedL I am afraid that most people will have to be satisfied with a Crimean plum-pudding for Christ- day. The turkeys andgeesetobe met coming from BaLal-ava to the camps are almost as numerous as they used to be in the old coaching days coming to to-n fronm Suffolk and Norfolk. There is, however, a great difference in the size of the birds. We have had irmmense flocks of bustards flying fron the eastwvard for the last few days. Hundreds of sportsmen have been on the lookout for them, and several have been killed. They are very lare. Some of those killed, I am told, weigh as much za 15lb. or 161b. There is snipe and wild fowl shooting to be had down on the Tchernaya, but it is at the risk of one's life that this sport is to be enjoyed, as the Russians are within shot, and generally take advantage of it. However, there are some men out here who are such eager sportsmen that they are not deterred even by rifle bullets. The mail wlich wras due yesterday has not arrived yet.
RmAL PoLIcE.-It was stated in Th1e Tbies a few days ago that the question of a uniform system of police for the rural districts of Devonshire was exciting some attention in that county. On Tuesday the subject was introduced at the De-on County Sessions, which were held at the Castle of Exeter, Lord Courtenaybheng in the chair. There was a large attendance of mnagistrates, among them being Earl Fortescue, Earl Portsmouth, Lord Ebrington, M.P., Sir S. iL Northcote, MP., Sir J. Duck-worh, 3LP Sir T. Kennaway, Sir J. Y. Buler, bLP., and the Bon. W. W. Addington. MT. Palk-, ILD.., in introduc_ing a motion in reference to the question of a rural police for Devonshire, of which he d previously given notice, observed that there mig,ht be many reasons adduced against a ruralpolice. The expense and aprent injustice of a body oa magistrates taxing the whole ratepayers of the county without giving themianopportunityof expresng their opinion was a feason wvhy they shouldnot be too hasty In deciding the questson; and it was doubtful, also, vhethwr the rural police adopted in other connties was the best that could be had for the county of Devon. He contended, however, that the whole question was i worth considering in committee, inasmuch as a body of polic was in existence in 42 parishes of the county, v;hich were paid partly out of the county-rate, iartlyb h oain of -landowners, and partly by rates levied onparishes. -Theyhad thus the nucleus of a police forcemn tscounty, butthe great objection to the present force-was that every policeman was his own master; that he was subjected to no control; and his efficiency was not, 'consequently, so great as he beieved it would be under other circuastancen HE concluded by moving a resolution, to the effect that, with i viewvto the improvement and efficiency of the county constabulary, a comanitteebeappointed to consider and report on the necessity of a county police and the best way of organizing the same. Earl Portsnouth seconded the motion, being thoroughly convinced that the existing state of the police in this county was verydefective, a.nd that an inquiry Vas necessary. - The resolution wms carried unanimously. - .- .

THE AST. I - . (11om omtR Owlf' COEESSPONDiNr.) - - rCOXSTAl4TINOPLE, Dzc.-24. The news of the fall of Wars, although Iong expected, has produced a deep inpression _he;' especially on those who are most concerned by it-_ namely, the Turks and the Tt2rkish Gover=iihenttIn spite of the reports 'which came in froraErzeroum and Trebiiond, and wlich leftb no`doubt inthe mind3 of unprejudiced persons, the thingwasup to the lagt rmoment denied and even for3maly contradicted in the Jour1na de enldt nptrp1e which is usuilly employed for Government crnmu iications. 1Now that the official report of the surrender hasbeen received, which removes all further doubt, and which makes it impossible to conceal it, I sudden eneigy hasarisen in offcial qitarters,';iu numberless are the councils and conferences whicli have taken place in consequetice.i Every pern3iwho knows, or is srupposed to know, anything about the matter has been summoned -to give an opinion. But it see,ms just the misfortune of Turkey to have too mnany advisers andcounsellers, and few, very few, men to act. ' The object of all these councils is,;irst, to find out the nerson or persons who are to blame for the .di-' asters, and then to guard against its consequen-Ef-: As regardls the first, everybody seems agreed that' no blame could possibly attach to the garriori.cfWars, which did whatever was humanly possible tD do. General Mouravieff, who was evidently well aware of the: strength of the Turkdsh, and- the weknetss of his own army, had surroundedrather than invested the place, so that the Thrlkish army, had it intended to cut its way throngh, woulld havf had to make a harassing march of several miles amid the numerous cavalry of the enemy before it could have met its adversaries. To do this with famished soldiers, and without guns, the hces having all perished, would have been a matter of impossibility. So there is only one opinion about the heroic defenders of Kars, and nevt5r, perhaps, has a military deed, unsuccessful in its ultimafe result, conferred more fame on its performers. .- Just as all opinions are unaninous in respect to the garison at Wars, so are they divided as to-the really guilty parties. The allies, the Tk-rish Governrment, Selim Pasha, and Omar Pasha are all in their turn pointed out as the offenders, according to the different views which are taken of the subject, and according to the different interests which come into play in this question. This question of guilty or not grilty is rther more important than it may seem, perhaps, at first sight. A town at ten days' distance from Constail. tinople, the central depot of the Eastern campaign,. invested by a comparatively smallforce of the enemy during four months, is left to its fate, and has at last to surrender without any effectual attempt beingmade to relieve it. What may we not expert; after this sample? It is more this- consideration than the actual loss of Wars which demands aL inquiry.. If we consider the question calnly, -we cannot but; come to the conclusion that the blame can hardly be attached to one person exclusively, but more or lesa to all those who had anything to do vith it. ThiE may, at the same time, explain the different vielw which are taken by different people in this matter. The allies are blamed for not having speedily enough supplied the means of transport for trae Turkish troops in the Crimea. Whoever kno,w anything of the circumstances will easily absolve them on this score. Omar Pasha went down -to Constantinople in July, and did not come back until a few days before the last assault. Instead of takini part in it, he demanded vessels for the 1aansport of his troops, a demand which, under the err cumstances, could scarcely, be granted, for whatwas Kars in comparison with the whole Crimean campaign, which-was just then on its turning point? After'thatthe expeditionto Winburn anduthe sendiag of the English Light Cavalry 'Brigade and:that of the French cavalry to Eupatoria made such a hea-v claim on the means of transport that, without ciip-' pling their own operations, the allies could not satisfy immediately the demands of the Turkish commander. As soon as this was possible the trans. ports were put at his disposal. The mistake of the allies seems rather to have been that they brolke up the Turish army by takrig away such a. large portion of it to the Crimea, where they were of no earthly use. They thus paralyzed the whole and rendered it inefficient. An army, wi,th such an imperfect organization as the Turkish arm %- has, cannot be thrown about and subsivided a(i libitum,, without losing its unity.. Omar Pasla, took the flower bf the army of the DanLbe'to the, Crimea, and what remained had to be reforned if ii; was to be of any use. The charges which. are brought against 'the Turkish Government are. of a more general charao. ter, and certainly this changeable nondescript bosz must in a great measure be held resp6nsible for the state in which it left its Asiatic frontiers. When Austria occupied- the Danubian rincipli. ties, and pledged herself %to keep out theRuxiens, and when the allies undertook the Crinean cam. paign, it must have been clear to every one that Asia was the only field of operations for aTur}dsli army; but, instead of concentrating all'its energy on that point, the Asiatic command- became all object of party intrigues and a trial of strengtl between military rivals. According to the fluchtu. tions of court favour and diplomatic influence ap. pointments were made anid cancelled, orders givell anl withdrawn, until General MouravieffIs appear. ance before Wars made an arrangement necessTry at the eleventh hour. ' The first idea which then occurred was to 'send off the Anglo-Turkish Contingent, vhose orgalinttion was just then completed. It certainly wai the simplest and most obvious idea, and it could ha-.e been easiest executed. A Turkish town was to ba' rescued, and an army to be formed in' a Xahomeclaa. country; what better centre of union could -hve been found than Turkish troops organi5sd by; European officers? Whose fault it was that this idea has not been carried out is a mystery which it would be difficult to fathom in the labyrinth of conflicting evidence. Some blame General Vivia, others Lord Stratford, others the French-Government, and others, the Turkish Govern:ent. Tlhe -most probable smpposition is, that the project failed on account of the different views entertained ;&bout matters of detail. .When theidea of sendingg the Turldsh Contigent for the relief of WIars was given up, the army of Omar Pasha was though' of; atl he, aniious tD escape from the anomalous position in-which he found himself in the Crimea, eagerly-seized this- opportunity, and -weant down to Consta4tinople .to make the final arrai,geinents. It is but fair to 8aythat the-Turkish Governmient displayed considerabl euiE at this point. Alon e as well as soldiers was put at his disposal, 'and the 'amy fumished with everything necessary, n' o that nothing remained- to be done but to execute the plan which had been adopted with the greatest nos- sible expedition. -When the Turldsh GoverrmnEnt. saw that the alies could not afford means of -jrajs., port for the TuIih troops in the -1,,ciTli - pteamer= Were hirod,- andahe reklt was-onfidenji expecte. -L -: - - - .General-Villiams-had written severaFtime- thai; he did not thinik it advisable to attack the Ruisiai position in front, a&d,that fhe best way to releve lim woula be to -mke aome , a n, or, rather, -en! mov,ent 'from -Bato'uni and itwas-with thii
DECREASE OF AMERICAN IM31IGRATION. I From the Nezw York- Times.) It is estimated by persons familiar with the rate of immi. gration that if the average be no greater the next six months than thc past, there willbe a faUing off in. 1856 of some 150,000 to 180,000 in the number of foreigners arriving on our shores. This is a weightyfact, and deserves careful considermtion from those who, inbusiness ormorals, are speculating on the-future of our country. Probably 80,000 of those who stay at home are Germans; the rest of the deficit is made up almost entirely of Irish. If each of these immigrants had consumed or spent $4 in New York as he passed through, it would make a difference next year to the city of some $700,000 in inicome. If each had possessed, in ready money, the average which the returns fiom Castle Garden slhow at present-namely, about $80-it would diminish the import of specie into the country by about $13,500,000; money which is not even an exchange, but is so much clear addition of wealth. Then aU these people consume ourproducts; they rent our houses, they wear our clothes, they eat our corn wheat and rye; our beef, mntton, and fish; they buy our.timberand brick, our iron and coal; they read our books, and papers;, and magazines. Setting down the average cost of living as $2 a-week to each man, woman, and child-which would be a low estimate-and supposing that they, at least, earn all they consunme by their labour, we have a loss next year to the producers of the countryto the farmers, the grocers, the builders, the clothiers, the riouseowners, the brickmakers, tlte coal-miners, the editors and bookcsellers-of $17,000,000. If these estimates be. correct, we have a direct loss nextyear to the country in this decrease of immigration of over $30,000,000. We caunot easily appreciate this loss until we take some corresponding destruction ol value in our more appareut wealth. People do not readily see loss and gain on a great scale. It has taken centuries to make the mnass understand that a farthing or a penny duty on a pound of some foreign artide imported is an immense loss to their own pockets. Texas was thought a valuable acquisition by many in its rich farms, though we paid a round price for it; yet the value of all the farms in Texas, and Arkansas besides, is no greater than the value lost by this year's decrease of immigration. New York and Penmsylvania boast themselves of rich crops of wheat, but thewholeworth oftheircrops, if no greaterthanin 1850, would be $2,000,000 short of the worth to us of those immigrants who stay at home for a single year. It would seem a fearful blow to the country, if by war, or fire, or any calamity, our whole exported manufactures-all these to cherish which we have been paying dutiessolong-shonldsuddenlybe utterly destroyed yetthe loss wouild be $N4,000,000 less, taking the value in 15, than the loss, this year. from impeded immigration. The quick destruction of aU the flour and corn and the prodcts of agrculture, which we usualy export, which bring wealth to so many thousands, would be but a little greater than the destruction, this year, of vwalue imported by the immigrants. Hf one-third of the cotton crop of last year had been lost, whlat lamentations would have re-echoed from one end of the UJnion to the other ! lIow many would have been bankcrupt; how many would have felt poorer ! Or, if the whole Indian corn crop last year of. NewEngland, Nlew York, 2New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the district of Columbia had perished, what a jeremiad of mourning would have arisen ! To appoint a now fast would have been the least which our governors could do. Yet the first of these supposed. losses is no greater, and the last is less, than what we shall silently bear this year from decreased immigration. Will not some good Know-nothing governor institute a fast ? The country will feel the deep injury done to its prosperity by this diminution of immigration, even if it does not see its source. Every man who owns tenemnent houses, the shipbuilder, the shipowner, the cheap grocer, the butcher,' the railwaycompames, the thonsandswho own stockin them, will feel it. The householder will pay higher soon for his carpenter, his plumber, his painter; the house-mistress must after a time give more for her cook or her laundress. The farmer must offer higher wages to his men, and put a higher price on his cattle, his milk, his potatoes, and wheat. Less new land will be broken, and those who have invested in Western lots must be disappointed in their plans. Business at the great depots of commerce in the West will be less active, ecause there are fewer hands to help it. Not so many railroads, or canals, or steamboats, or flatbats wiU be built, because them is less travelling over them, and less labour at hand to brild them. The cost of new cities, of schools, churches, stores, and dwellinghouses will be greatly increased, because theme are fewer workmen, -at higher rates. Eachprofessionalmanmust, afteratime,feelthis; the client can pay lecs; the church-goer less; the patient less. vlawages to labouring men are not in themselves necessariy an advantage; they depend on their relation to the value of food, clothing, and means of livin. With fewer hands to labour in this country every article of living would be more expensive, while the impeding and stoppage of business would not be compensated by the higher rates to the working man. The wellbeing of each class in a conntry like this depends on the weUbeing of every other If the workman gets $4 a-day who before got $2, he gains nothing if his bread and clothing coat double; and he loses, if there are just half the means for busmess enterprises as there were before. There wil be less workfor him and all that he uses will cost more. Under this fallng off of immigration wil cease soniething of that almost ineredible spring of enterprise and pros -rity which has thius far characterized our communities. ft wil thus be seen that tlis wonderful progress was, not a mysterious blessing conferred by an unexplainable Providence, or altogether the fruit of the old Scandinavian and Saxon blood. It will be found not altogether due to our rich virgin soil, or our wide territory, or our deep rivers, or entirely to our Puritan industry, or our Republican Government, or our isolated position. We shall see, then, perhaps too late, or perhaps after a deep depression of every branch of industry and commerce, that those squalid imbruted Irishmen, landinm in tatters or homespun; these foreign, guttural, garlicky Germans, with their nut-brown faces and brown shoulders; these conceited Englishmen and hairy Frenchmen, these out o'elbows Scotchmen and sharpeyed Welshinen and rag-picking Italians, all had some part, 'and no snmall art)in building up this grand structureof our prosperity.: we shall fee then-and that at no distant timne , -that we depend on them as well as they on us; that their 'hard-ered ferns- and sovereigns, their tough hands and brtawny muscles, even their very patience of drudgery and'* :dareeable work, are all rich importations to our national We shall then see in ever7 dirty shipload poured forth upon our-docks, not so many intruders, or idlers, or bengars, otdependents, but so much invaluable addition to the nehes sf the country. And perhaps then, also, as we have missed the ready ingenuity, the cheerful toil, the natural taste, the social happiness of these foreign artisans-as we hate seen that our country was becomingless a blessingto humanitydepressed and degraded-than to the Anglo-Saxon raceS, we may be ready to welcome the poor foreig n labourer *ith a muore humane and a broader charity, feeling that both were placed by Providence to be of good to each other.- .

I THE STRRENDER OF KARS. I rO5 ; CgERESPONDENT.) _-, . - j S - 5 *s * [-ERZEROUML, DEC. IL. Our first newsofthe-probablefalofKarsreached' us throngh that fino old oldier General 1minetty. Ridingin hot haste, hc'reached thison the dfterneon of the 28thult.~ The intelligence he brought simply amoSunted to this-that the provisions beixi¢@, all' but' ex'hausted General W9iliams had sent his aide-decamp, Major Teesaie, to Mouravieff,:to'propoethe opening of negotiations. Knmetty'sown case was a. desperate one. He Lad been formally sentia?ce4 to death by the-'"Austrian Government, and had rio' mercy to expect at the hands of the Russians; Things being at this pass,- he waited on -General Williams,- and - besought -hin to accept. his resignation; and allow himin to cut' his way, thrwh theeneiiimys.liises, His sword, he'said, was nowof no further-use, and he would ratherblo* huis brains out than. becorme a 'prisoner at discretion:' Williams, feeling how little he could do for him -if it came to the worst, allowed hin to leave, w-hich he d;d that very' night, accompanied by General Kohlman and an escort of truty Kurds. Kolman, as an officer who had'held h-igh rank in the Hungarian revolutionaryatmy, was in the same predicament as himself. The Russianisoldiers on the move at night recognize each other by a peculiar lo*,- long whistle; and, imitating this, the adventurous little party succeeded- in' passing several of their patioli. At last, however, tlhey were recognised, charged, and dispersed, but, meeting at a place of rendezvous previously fixed upon, continued their journey -till they reached this withouf further accident.: After their arrival we' remained in a state of 1i-. certainty for several days. They had left. Xiii before Teesdale's retun- (it-turned out afterivards thathe had been detained to dinner by Mouravieff3, and were, consequently, quite ignorant as to wvat terms might be offered' and' accepted on either side. All they knew was that General Williams',saffairs had reached the point of desperation, and that he was not in a position to refuse any condition,s which the Riusians might please to offer. We werd at last relieved from our pain'fulsuspens6 by the arrival of Captain Thonmson's intrepreter, an-' other Hung,arian refugeeinthe Turkish service. He had left Kars after negotiations had been -cloed; and was enabled to inform us on what conditions it had been surrendered. They wvere as follows - That all non-combatants should be allowed to leave; that private property should be respected, the 'inhabitants uninjured, and that all foreigners in the Turkish service should be permitted to depart unquastioned. Last, not ' least, all the officers were allowredl to retain their swords in consideration of their gallant defence on the 29th of September, and to the honour of Mouraviaff be it said, that this generous clause was inserted in the' body of the treaty with his own hand. Seventy guns, on the other side, and 20,000-standof£arms were made over to theRussians. TheNizam(regulars)to the number of 5,000 w.ere ta;en prisoners of war. The Rediff, or militia, and Bashi-Bazonks were dismissed,-to go whither they would. Liberty, he,wever, in the case of the latter, has been at best but a cruel gift. Our Siberian winter--~has set in"-along the loftier mountain ranges, and report speaks of 150 of these -poor wretches being smothered to- ether in a teppi, or' snowstorm, within the wild passof the Suw anlee-dgh. Numbers, too, have been frzen to death, and the villages along the road from K ars are filled with their miserable comrades, whohavesulnkexhaustedupon'theway. Weseethemi stagering ini all day along the principal thoroughfar into the city, haggard and footsore, their countenances half idiotic from cold, hunger, and fatigue. Their condition, even before leaving Kars, was as wretched as could be; so much so (I quote word for word from an eyewitness) that it was positively painful to stir out of doors. They were lying about in all directions, groaning piteously-watching the Russian provision-waggons, which, as if to add to their misery, passed almost all day within their ken. Towsnspeople and soldiers alike suffered all the horrors of famine. The former crowded round the General as he rode out of his quarters, and prayed him with all the, eloquence of despair to seek some means of puttig an end to their misery. Women forced their way into his very rooms, and, throwing their starving, children at his feet, implored him rather toldl them at once than let themperish thus piecemneal for want of sustenance. The hospitals were crowded with sick; on the Thursday before the surrender S0 men died in one day. Many went mad or became idiots from sheer hunger and hard -work. Those who preserved a remnant of health, half-starved as they were, and scarcely clothed, were obliged to mount sentry 'almost every night up to the ancles in snow. Since the battle of the 29th there had been no animal food to issue to the troops. Horses had indeed. been killed in the General's stables secretly by night, but the meat was sent to the hospitals for the sick. A pittance of bread or flour made into weak broth was all that the working soldiers had to subsist upon. Discipline was almost at an end. The soldiers hadat one time all but worshipped General Williams. After the action, in particillar, they gathered round their galant leader, only too happy, after the Eastern fashion, to touch the hem of his garment in token of their submission and respect. Now these same men refused to salute him, turned their eyes away when they saw him approach. Still, to the last, he hardened his heart in hope. Omar Pasha had written to him, on his arrival at Batoimn, toholdoutonlyanothermonth, and he would be with him. The Muchir here, too, Selim Pasha, who had been sent from Constantinople to take the command, forwarded him a similar despatch, informing him 'that he was at the head of a large and well-discinEed force, all admirably eqluipped and eager for the fight, and that he would lose no time in marching to his relief. Thus deceived, the General determined to hold out as long as a mouthful of food remained; and, in fact, the last biscuit was issued out of store on the very day of the capitulation. At last, on finding out the truth that the. Muchir here at least had no intention of coming to his aid, he called a general council and proposed a sally. But the troops by this time were too exhausted even to march, far more to fight their way for days together over the mountains. We had no cavalry, no artillery horses; fighting our way in short, at such odds, was out of the question, and a surrender was determined upon as the only remaining resoprce. The terms obtained, as may easily be believed, were much more favourable than the vanquished had any right to expect; and, allowing all credit to the generous forbearance of Mouravieff, no small praise must at the same time be accorded to General Williams for having managed matters so well under such difficult circumstances. The two thing,s that he felt most anxious to settle well were the protection of the inhabitants and the safety of his ' brave companions in arms who might otherwise have paid a heavy penalty for their doubled devotedness to the cause of European freedom. His fixed determination on these points of honour was of an order which needs no praise of mine. He threatened, in fact, that, unless his wishes in regard to them ;were acceded to, he would destroy the guns, blow up the works, and then leave the Russians to do their worst. Fortunately, he had to deal with a reasonable enemy, and,the high-minded sacrifice was averted, no less by firmness on the one side than forbearance on the other. He had no difficulty, as far as I can ascertain, in settling matters as he wwised. It was late before the Turkish'troops were marched out of the town. Those of the Russiaus were drawn up without to receive them, and the victors presented arms to the vanquished as they passed. The higher' prisoners were treated with the greatest kindness and consideration. The General, after he had despatched the little business that re- mamed on his hands, was sent on the route to St. Petersburg in Mouravieff's carriage andfour, accompanied by Colonel Lake,+ Captain Thomson, Mr. C hurchill, his private Secretary, and an English' soldier servant. All his Turkish servants had deserted him in their dread of an imprisonment in pRusiai lut, as some similar custom has always prevailed in the world, and can hardly be considered peculiar to Turkey, after all there wa3 not much to complain of. As to himself, he wasin good health and spirits, looking forward to a speedy release. At the time of our last intelligence the Russians hadjust takeu possession of Kars, and the town was in a state of confuion, such as might be expected from its ocupation by a mixed army -of wild Cossack.s, Circassians, and Kurds, with no small portion of a regular soldiery-the hardest drinkers in the l* Nohing i said of Teeod%ie. Tiis imst be ai o,eI I thin~k.- -F. H, I 11- world. All our eriPIryl0s however, attached to the Turkish army were -treated with the greatest consideration till their final departure. M Zohiab, for instance, on General Williams's staff as interpreter, was lying ill of typhusat the time of ocCupation.- On hearing the ri6t of the s6ldiers he. thou'lt it. would be safer to apply :to. the comnmandant for a guard; but the latter at once relievedc "his fears by assiring him that strict orders had beeni' 'issued' to' insure i&nnt being mlested; and that if anything happened he' should be npplied to at once. Passports were granted to the Hirngarian officers in 'the- Turkish service. with the greatest readiness. jThe tconduct of the Russians, indeed, throughout has been entirely irreproachable. There is very little newshere-as regards Erzeroumn itself. The Mluchir has been hanging 3fev spies. On'riding through the bazaarthe' other day I'found one strung up at the'-Gorgi-kapu, 'or` G-or's- gate. He was "suspended .only a few. yards: -from the 'ground, 'with- his hands tied behind him, and then fastened to' the shutters 'of a shop at his bahk, to&prevent the body from swinging. The Osmanli inmate of the said shop took it very quietly. He was sitting crosilegge on his cotunter, smoking his chibouque, and staring at, the corpse as apathetikally as possible. It was slung from his roof, too; like a sign, and, if it had' really been so, he could not have, tak-en it more as a matter of course. The man was an Armenian, and was to have received 500 piastres (something less than 41.) in return for his information. 'The weather on the hllDs has been very inclem'ent. I have already mentioned that" 150 soldiers were' buried in a snowdrift. -A caravan was swept down .inthe same storm, and 10 snen1frozen to death. The load lost was a. valuable'one, containingO, hwever, a .curious itemi-leech6s. They foirm an important article of Persian esport. 'The value of them is estimated at n r 3,000'.
U,SSIAN COMf,lERCE QOAr THEBCASPIAN. TO THE EDITO1i-OF: THE TImES. * Sir,~-I owe it to .your correspondent in to-day's. paper, who signs himnself " An Old 52d," to explain the diffieulty which he- finds in reconcilinig my calculastions of ''the commerce- on the; Caspian with the statistics of the Board of ITrade. 'My data are the same as those of which 'he has Xuade use; but'I have taken'th6 aveinge of the four 'years 1849-1852, whereas he has confined hiniself to the last year of that period. He is quite right in his conjecture that in my estimate of the Caspian commnerce I conhined myself to the consideration of that between Russia andPersia; and I did this, because no other country has any Q)0it on that sea. It is true that there is a small itraffic with Rhiva, through:the Caspian ; {but, indepndently of its. extreniely sm'all amoumt, it is of such peculiar kind. that if the waxter. co'nuunication7 with Astrachan Weie cut off, the whole of it nmight: be easilytransferredto one ofthe other routes, *hichno number of British criisers on the Caspian could affect. Your correspondent mnst n imngine that the tiade' ith' the Kiirhesd -steppes and that with. Bokhara, Taschkend, and Kokhaun which he sees set downinthe excellentstatisticatableswhich hequotes, 'is a seaborne traffic. -If: ho will refer to a most instr'uctive b66k; which was much read when it first appeared-I nmeari Buines's Trdvels iit&' Boliardlie will see an account of the different rontes *by'which the Asiatic trade of Russia is carried on. In Burnes's time tho 'main road. to ' Bokhara wais by way of Mun- -Kislak, on' the Cas- piai; but now the -tables show that the Khivantrad e-;-whkjis the one th'at passes by that route is very inconsiderable; a result which I should be disposed to interpret by the conjecture that the improved navigation on the -Indus had brought British manufactures by way of Affghanistai into Khiva,-aAdfortdd out the Russian. ''' - I The -rifflc with the Kirghese steppes passes, I have no doubt, by Orenburg and Samara. If your correspondent will look down tho proper column of the tables, he 'will see that its principal items are cattle and skins, the latter of which'are most pro-. bablyfat this moment protecting from the inclemency of the weather troops destined -in tle' eaxly sanuner to be brought into the Crimea.% . The trade vwith Bokhara, -and that with Taschkend, wvhich appear in the tables, are, _apparently, that commerce which Burnes describes astaking place by way of'Troitskl andKuzzul-jur. respectively. As the' bnly 'question which I desired to illustrate was the effect likely to be produced by the destruction of Russian trade on the Caspian-supposing such a thing possible-I was unwilling to. introduce the mention of the above topics iny last letter. I trust your correspondent does not understand ne to disparage his recotmendatioriof miita,O,opera-' tions in Imeritia and Georgia. If I had thought it becoming to offer any opinion upon such a subject, it would have been one in. hearty concurrence withhis views. But, althouih I havo no 'more doubt thall he that our enemy is trying, and always *vill try, to push on to India, I am one who think that Great Britain is more-likely, thro'ugh the silent but effective operation of manufactures and commerce, to get to the Eastern bank of tlip Ou-al,. t han her rival, by a widely different agency, to reach the western bank of the Indus. All that we, really want is a spirit of patriotism in officials, sufficient to overcome the habit of jobbing and nepotisim which seems ergrained in English society-in- the lower and middle classes, perhaps, even more than the highest. The throwing open of the Indian service to all meritorious candidates is, I believe, a firmer secuity for the stability of olur 'Indian empire than " a Gibraltar in the Caspian" 'wotda be. It will put 'Us, pro taonto, on -a - lvel ivith the . Czar, who has no constituents to humour and no political party to keep together; and accordingly, as facts prove, generally experiences no difficulty in iinding "the right man for the right place."

Pardon me the obsolete word. " School," I am aware, is in this predicament without the prefix of "dame." The masters, or presidents, or provostas of these insdtitions, where young gentlemen of the tenderest ago carry on their heads triangalar caps, as is customary at Oxford and Cambridge, have abstained from recommending, by precept or practice, the donation of,a shilling, or its components, out of their Christmas collec&ane. Meanwhile, you perceive by the note enclosed, a young lady of the vicinlty, far. from ±epreng such an ebu31ition of generosity, sends a w,hole handful of stampns To these I add all the centributions Svhich, during two mouths, have been collected here in the circulating libraries. - I remain.

: ' -- THE . THE ITED- S E-. I ', ',(B0.0 COILFSPOJX'DET. .-;- - *. i1iNW YOR Dxc.. 18.. Congress is still.without n 'Speaker, nor has the strugglo'of the week apparently brought things any nearer a close than they were in the beginniag of it. Banks the out and-out Anti-NebraszkaZdide stil! stands at 10a, Richardsbn the representative ofthe lAdminustration, cannot get beyond his 74 votes; and the scattering votes,5though now, mostly concen-,i tratecl onFuller of oennylvana, are still nunerous enough to prevent Banks from having a majority over' all. "Two !of the "scatterin3g" have an- hounced their wfllingneis to vote for Ba'iks .whenever enough votes are gained to insure a rmajority; ,but apparently there is no present prospect, though any day's negotiation niay bring about an oraniztion. The constant calling over the rot and answering to narmes is a wearisoxie business at the vetd ; but the -'members thus far have'pre.. 'served their temper unusually well,, and latterly have taken to speech'making by way of enlivening the monotony. . The delay in the organization of the House, and *consequent delay.in the President's Message, may not be unproductive of g6od results. It gives time for quieting any feelingivhich may have arisen out of the recent discussions of. the relations between this country and Great Britain, and for mature consideration of. the official language to be used. In fact, poople have alhieady forgotten the discussiors. Things move so rapidly in this country, one -excitement follows so closely upon the heels, if not upon the very -back of the last, and men are so much engrossed in their private ;business, that a matter of public business. must be -very press'ig and- very important to engross their attention for a long time. They are generally very well content to leave the management of their foreign business to their elected rulers, trusting to be able to set things right at the.next. election if they go nwrong; The foreigapolitics, or policy, rarely take :precedence of the domestic. The Government pursues suich course as it chooses, and in due time publishes what it has done, wllich is duly consigned to oblivion in the doubtfu type and paper of -the iC6ngressioial printer. Occasionally a document like the Xulseniankor Kosta letter excites a momentary attentiofn,; but how rapidly and how deep they are buried the history of. these two discussions will show. Even the Know-nothing party, which, by all its principles, ouight to be an active observer of the foreign policy of the country, restraining it to a strict neutrality, has little to say upon these questions;-and much. intriguing to do upon the domestic questions, which alone permnanently interest .the -nati6n;. Hnad the P'resident's: Message been delivered two weeks iig,o the part.that touches upon *the relations between: Great Britain and the United States (if such part there be) would have attracted attentionthroughout the Union, and wouldc-have .excited a discussion that might perhaps have left somb permanent-impression . It was understood to be moderate in its tonb; but even the most moderate document -at that time would have fallen on ground.- prepared to. receive it. Now, I think that (unless iinexpiectedly belligerent) it will be passed' by and - forgotten the next day. The discussion of the point at difference goes on at Washington. - B3ut allT'diplomatic discussions are long, and the longer the more harmless; so that the outside feeling is (so far as a thought is- bestowed upon it) that, iless something intervene, the discussion may continue until it wears itself out, for no one can see the end of a diplomatic controversy. Should it still be brought-to the sudden-terniination that was anticipated three weeks since, the wonder would be much less than nine days long, unless there should by some possible chance be a real apprehension of serious diffliculties springing fro m it. The Central American question is regarded at Washington:as the most difficult one-to settle between the two countries. The success of the Filibusters upon the Isthmus has complicated the question, and has caused vigorous measures-to be taken to prevent personsherefrom joirningtle invaders. The Lresident has also issued the following proclamation:- ~ " - "A^ PRO(IAd'1b " Br- E - PRESInENT OF' ArEE TrrONED STATES OF ! AMRrCA. - ; "' Whereas information has been received 'by me that sufidry persons, citizens of the United States and others, residents therein, are preparing, within the jurisdiction of the same, to enlist or'enter themselves, or to hire or retain others to participate, in military operations %ithin the State of Nicaragua: "Now, therefore, I, Franklin Pierce, President of the UJnited States, do v} rn all -persoasagaiast connecting themselves with any such enterprise or undertakitng, as being contrary to their duty as good citizens and to the laowsof their conatr and tltreatenirtg to the ~peace of the United " Ido further admonish all persons who may depart from the United States, either singly or in numbers, organized or unorganized, for any such purpose, that they will thereby cease to be entitled to the protection of this Government. " I exhort all good citizens to discounntenance and prevent as y such disreputable and crimninal undertaking as aforesaij, charging all offlcers, civil and military, having law ful powver inthe premises, to exercise the same for the purpose ofnmaintaining the authority and enforcing the laws "In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of thsUnited States to be affixed to these presents. "Done at the city of Washington, the 8th day of Da- ceriber, 1855, and of the independence of the United States the 80th. " Bythe President, Th W. L. MAMY, Secretar of State." The new Government has sent a Minister here, but I understand that he will not be recognized as Minister by the Administration. I omitted some two weeks ago to notice a meeting of Irish Fi11ibusters at the Astor-house. I forgot to notice the meeting-mainly because it was of so little consequence. These persons who propose to undertake Fillibustering on the most extensive scale are of no account or weight with the Irish in' America. They are disowned by the leading Irishmen in Ne* York, and by the Americans of respectability or means who have acted with them. The threatened civil war inm Kanzas has not been averted, nor has it yet broken oit. At the latest date the Free-state men: were assembled at Laurence to the number of about 700, armed with rifles, and possessed of five pieces of canaon. The Missourians were encamped about 400 or 500 strong within seven miles of them; and several hundred MEssourians were known to be on their way to join the invaders. When their force may be united,itis supposed to number near 1,000, anned with rifles, mounted, and with several pieces of cannon. The Governor was near Laurence with a few United States?' troops, and with- more within reach; and, when last heard from, it vwas hoped that he: would march into Laurence with the Government forces, and leave .the Missouri ro-wdies in their encampment. If thisis donepeace maybeestablished; but unless it be done- a conflict is feared, which would excite a feeling difflicult to allay. Up to this time I think thiitthe Free-state men, althongh sent there under 7)eculiar circumnstances, and many of them. enthusiasts, have behaved with remarkable discretion. I The news by the Baltic, las bad a favourable-effect on our markets; money is easier, 'stocks are better, and a better feeling prevails everywhere. -4 The following proclamation has been issued, announcing the extension of the Reciprocity Treaty to Ne&foundland:- : * "A PROCLIIWATION "BrP T11E PRESIDENT OF THE UrTrD STATES OF - ~~~AMERICA.

SfONEY- fARKETantdCITYINTELLIGBNCE. Welnesday Eveninlg. P&.There has been a great icrease of heaviness to-i 4ay in the English funds. Consols opened at a 1irther decline of a quarter per cent., and soon I Wxperienced another falI, from which there was no permanent recovery. The first quotation was 87j so f, whence they receded till there were sellers at iTg. A rally then occurred to 87X, but at the offixi3al close the price was 87 to i, and after regular 'iours transactions took place at 87f to 4. For the .account on the 7th of February they left off at 87:g. ;No influence was exercised during the day by any tforeign intelligence, nor is it believed that the iilightest circumstance has transpired in any ;quarter regarding the progress of the pend:5pg negotiations. The depression appeared solely attributable to some speculative sales made in ->consequence of the almost universal disposition of -the public to consider the idea of peace as altogether ! delusive, and that it wil be wise for them to prepare Lfor a loan of twenty or thirty millions after the .ieeting of Parliament. There was no particular pressure for money to-day in the Stock-Exchange, .,kut 6 per cent was still paid for advances oi Go- rernment securities. Out of doors the demand con~tinnes at ful rates. Bank Stock closed at 205 to A20661; Reduced, Sg to i, New Three per Cents., S77 to S8; Long Annuities, 3 9-16; -Annnities, 885, 16i; Exchequer-bonds, 97 to As and Indiabonds and Exchequer-bills, 11s. to 7s. discount. Foreignsecurities were also heavy. A fall took '.place in Turkish Six per Cents. of about i per cent., t'and there was no recovery to the close. The opera- tions were at 82j, 81, 82, and 81g. In the guaranteed Four par Cent. Scrip bargains occurred at 31 and A, and the final Luotation was 3k to g discount.

Certificates, 94k. The corn-market this morning was steady at the decline of MIonday. -- After the holyday on the Paris Bourse yesterday, *the French funds this morning opened with an unLfavourable tone. and a fall has been established of fully I per cent., the final quotations of the Three p per Cents. being 63f. 1c. for money and 63f. 30c. for the end of the month. The mnovement is supposed to have been caused chiefly by the difficulties of the monthly liquidation having been aggravated by the heaviness on this side. The shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the month ending the 30th of November confirm -th;e indications-of the activity of trade presented by hlte export tables, and shioNV a considerable increase "in the extent of tonmage employed. This increase 'is chiefly in foreign vessels, which, owing to the absorption of English vessels for Govemnment purposes, are required to siipply intnediate wants. .Annexed are the general totals of entries and clearances Entered inward.- - # ITn regare TO me coastmg trade the tonnage en- tered inward was 1,037,539 in tne month ending the -th of December, 1853; in 1854 it was 1,087,265; and in the present retirn it is 998,641, including 16 foreign vessels, of au, aggregate burden of 4,203 tors. The clearances outward were 1,135,508 in December, 1853; 1,109,089 in 1854; and 1,125,320 (in:cluding 2,910: tons of foreigr.) in 18.55.a 3,etters from Riga to-day of the 2th of December state that a number of vessels wrere load1ingr at that port for the East Sea, with hemp, co an li d for sowing. The activity of the overland trade t.lrough Prussia caused the exchange to be steadily maintained. From St. Petersburg the mercantile intelligence -is scanty. Trade is described as dull, and the Carcity of specie and provisions is acknowledged to it he severely felt. Still, in such meagre allusions as ?-ar made to politics there is nothing to confirm the e.xpectation of peace on the terms proposed by -Austria. The recent revelations regarding the _ drain upon the Russian peasantry caused by the _-war seemn to have attracted much attention. The evil is admitted even by writers friendly to Russia; - wvhile in letters froni some of those best acquainted --with thc interior of the country the question as to t the absence of any increase in the population for -years past is discussed at considerable length:- " Without a lnowledpe of the country," it is said, " it _m_ight be assruned that the want of numerical increase in the population is to be attributed to the barrenness of the Z:Soil and the peculiarities of climate. But this is not the '7 case. Three-fourths of the land is of the very richest de- £cription, and produces heavy crops, with little or no application of manure, and the climate is beantiful as far north sa Moscow;- while between that city and St. Petersburg ;it nesembles that of the northern States of Ane- rica. Even beyond St. Petersburg, as far as the ~White Sea, the country may be compared to C-Canada. It is covered with magnificent pine forests, and .p.oduces fine crops of oats, rye, and other cereals, which are shipped in large quantities to Norway, Germany, and z EngLine There is, in fact, nothing in the Russian soil to -_prevent a ten tines greater increase, and a consequent . amelioration of the circumstances of the people. The adhe-o Ei of the Conservative party to the system of slavery is the gand cause of theabsence of al progress Thia system - is carried on in Russia with less respect to the wellbemi of - the victims eventhan in America. So far as regards their social rights the one is much on a level vith the other, but theirpersonal ill-treatmient is more severe in Russia, owing -- toe ntterimpossibility of givingany pubEcity to it. The --peoprietors retain the least trustworthy for field labour, granting passports year by year to those uyon vhom they c-:think they can rely to repair to the manufactuing towns, --where they earn about Ms. sterling per month, of which about two-thirds is paid to their owners, the remaining -ihird being sufilcient to keep themselves and families on rye bread, which can be bought at Ad. per lb., and which is their food for ever. In this condition their only encouragemnent to labour is freedom from the stick, the owners, even on hiring them out, makind it a condition that thev will not be responsible for their ileness --if its free applicaMion be neglected 3Many persons of high * standing in the country among those who are opposed to a I systematic education of the people still feel for their de& guided social position and physical sufferings, but fear the _power of 19-20ths of the nobles, who are asignorant as their laves. Among those who wished an alteration wvas the late Emperor N.icholas, who signed a ukase several years ago .-iDg the price at w hich serfs might buy their liberty, but - even ne, bold as he was, feared to put it into execution. Hence,.from all we have beard of his character, it is not to be expected the present Emperor will strik-e out in that cdirection, however well he may be disposed, unless the _uobles should he impoverished bya;; continuance of the war. This end would very soon be attained if a stop were put to -the overland trade throuh Pssia, and consequently it is c to the conduct of that country in promoting a continuance of the struggle that the greatest miseries of the period are vow to be attributed." ithrespect to a new submarine mnachsine for war purposes one correspondent remarks M"r. lEauer, after being refused by the British Goveriianent has obtained great encouragement from the Runs, t who nave been at the expense of. erectin one of his ns _chines, at a cost of about 15,0001.

With the exception of common dressing hides (which have recently accumulated to some extent), the stocks are lower than they have been for many years past, and the continued large requirements for army purposes are likely to cause a great scarcity of prime sole leather at no distant period. Prom the commencement of the past year a gradual inprovement has taken place in nearly every descnption of leather, which may be accounted for by the extrordina7 requirements of Government contractors. Notwitbstandig the stringency of the money-market and the dearness of provisions-both of which causes would, under ordinary crcmstances, have p roduced unfavourable results-our market has not only been firn, but from month to mont.h increased rates have been obtained; sholuld the present war continue thue ulpward tendency will increase; and, on the other hand, if peace be established, a reaction must be anticipated, as large supplies of foreign l.athet would be shipped to this corttry for sale, the manufacture on the continent basing considerably increased of Late."

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE COMlPANY. .rAd-Ai--t I Ladies and Gcntlemen,-I have takentb-e hlerty of addressing a few words tovu yeby way of a Ietter, published by 3r. Ffin&han Wilsocn, of the Boyal Exchange, London third edition, with additional notes). In thatletter } have made some remarks on the topics which have necessarily come under the notice of the committee lately appointed to investigate the affairs of the company, at the saute time stating my views ou some imrortant points relating to its future management with a view topremoeing the sterestof the shareholders. It may appear highly presumptuous in me to offer myself asa candidate without the recommendation of either the four new directors or the members of the committee " appointed to confer with the directors in selecting shareholders to be recommended to fill the office of directors in the place of them who have resigned." I do so, however, with the feelings of upholding the independenoe of the sbareholders. Ibelongtonoparly. I haveneithercourted the interest of the directors or that of the committee-noT did I express my intention of becoming a candidate until after the report had been officialy "ned by the memnbers of the committee. becaue I have alwa-s consered that the election of directors ought to be vested in the shareholtlers. The committee-that is, the five members wbo have signed the reportdelivered to you-have selected four from theirfive to be recommendedas directors. In doin" so theylegallyfeeltheyean defy the whole body of shareholders, holQdng, as they do, such an amount of votes by the number of shares they themselves represent, independent of the votes of the existing directors and the proxies of theirfriends anddependents. Proxies are peifeetly legal; hut emfortunately, consttuted as the company of the Crystal Palace now s, it is in the power of the directors, aided by a few extensive holders of shares, to carry by ballot any resolution, hovwever obnoxious to the general body of sha-eholders, or however injurious to the interests of the company. The directors of the company form an original self-elected board; and as long as thepowerof voting by proxy according to the number of shares so long will it remain so. In nearly all other companies the votes are according tothe rtioofshares; thwti,apemonholdingIoshareshis one vote, 20 shares two votes, 40 shares three votes, and so on inpresettion, to perhaps six or eight votes hbut afterrlCa shares, apersenholrtig 1,000 shares would not have more votes than the holder oZ the 100 shares Verydifferet, owever, is it in theCrtalPalaceCompany dher aperson bolding a0.0 avnes has 1.000votes, thusenabling a fev lage holders to swam p by balet the wishes of the majority of almost evey npublic meeting, thus shfoving the faree of caling the sh,weholders togethcr, another act of the " great sham" of such pro- I do net make these observatidns with anyfeeling of hostiliit aaoinstihenew board ctf directors; I do so with a degree of perfect independence, having alw;ays £unmS intercoursc with the beani done EO. Where! c an- conscientloosly support their views I do with real and sincerity, but never wiill I consent to forego those feelingPs in erler to obtaintheir approbation and aid in obtaining avoice oficially with3 them.I I cannot, however, accord with the manner in vhich an enoemo1 amoumt of the capit.d has been allowed to be expended accoingto the fanciesof afew individuals, mncontroled bya hody capab'-e of judging right from wrong, and having theirfavonrite hobby to casry out, neobeimg responsible for the failures of their projects. It is, however, of no use rakingup the errors ofthe past, though, at the Sanie time, if those on the one side are to be overlooked, so ought the ones Of the other. The controlling power that enables or tempts any one of Its members to act indiscreetly is morally responsible for the rsnult. Unmanly, indeed, it is to gloat over the indiscretion ofa coadjutor wh6, after leading his comnailons tothe entrance of the mine, is found to be incapable ofworking it, orratherso ludged by his friends, who perhapsmightindividuaywithbenesltstuda the golden maxim "know thyself." I fear from the above doctrines I shall not realie the result of "medio tutiesimus ibis," but rather of that "betxween two stools," &c. I have no private interests to 4serve. II ave neither courted nor ever accepted the numerous offers of proxies from large shareholders and, though . canot agree to all the proceedings of the board of directors, yet I consider that the bounden thanks of the shareholders are due to the present directors fir firnly retaining their seats after the defection of their magnanimors chairman and companions, with the view of confronting the now conseouentopprobriumof theirfalacious ideasofprofit and most unwarranted Idea of the pecuniary faiure of the undertakmg. As a shareholder desirous only of promoting the interests of the company, and most conveniently residing within a few moments walk of tpliob`idin,Iask for your personal support,firmly believing thatthe experience I have gained in matters of general business, and in an ocems pa:ion so closely connected with the fine arts, may be, to a certain extent, available in the direction of the (lrs;t-I Palace Company, I have the-honour to be.

SEPJious AFRAY Wrm PoACIERs.-TWo laboifing men, named James Hod-son and Mark Kirby, of Marton, near Boroughbridge, "Yrkshire, were en Thursday last charged before Mfr. J. Dent one of theWest Riding magistrates, with niglht poachinig and violence, in the township of Goldsborough, near Knaresborough, on the precedin- night. Theo facts of the case wer.e. as follows.:-M. Richard Phillips, gamekee to -the Hon. W. E. Duncombe, M.P. for East Retfordwho now resides at Goldsborough-hall, waswatching ou his master's. estate near Goldsborough, accompanied by a gamewatcher named Thomas Johnson, on the night of Wednesday last Just past midnight they heard a gun -fired,. and shortlvafterwards six more guns were firedl The keepers entered Goldhborough-wood, and saw three men, each havinga gun. On observing the keepers Kirby went towards Phillip and struck at him with a guni. A very desperate conffict ensued -between the poachers and the keepers, but eventually the prisoners vere secured, the third man having run away. 'Kirby was shockingly bruised, and his arm had been torn by oneof thekeepers'dogs. Hodgsonandthetwo keepershad each likewise got very severely hurt and cut, andwhen before the Court each bad his bead bandaged, and ailseemed in a pitiable condition. Johnson bled a good deal at the back of the head fronithe effects of a blowwith'a gun inficted by Hodgson. Phiipss cut intl;e forehead and his left eat Was split in twb from a blow with Xirby's double-bxrrelled It was adinitted that the keepers had encouraged the aogto attack the men.' The prisoners are notorious poachers, and were recently convicted by. the justices at Knaresborough for an offence against the game laws. They were now both committed for trial at the next Yorkslire Assizes.

'>T CHTURCr-RATE QuESToI.-In the Easter weetk of 1855F we had occasion to state that in nearly all the northern towns where the vestries were open, and the privilege of levying wvas accorded to the parishioners, resolutions for voting church-rates had, with scarely an exception, been negatived. We stated, also, that in the parish of Tynemouth-a parish where there had been great disturbance when the dictuma of the Exchequer Courtwas inforce, giving the minority the powver of levying a rate, as the goods of Dissenters and Quakers had been seized-it had not been attempted to put a rate for the repair of the church to the iote at the vestry meeting, but a voluntary rate to be assesed upon the property of Churchmen alone had been agreed to iistead. At a meeting of the vicar, chvrchwardenLs, and the members of the established church, hdd a day or two ago, asd assembled to devise some means to keep the churches of the town in decency, the voluntary rate havizg totally failed, some facts were divulged which showed in tle- strongest light the unsatisfactory position of the church-rate question. It seems that in the pariah of Tynemiouth, which contains a population of more than '30 000 persons, with shipping property, manufactories, coAi mines, shipbulding vards, and c&aishipping places of immense value, only 105!. U43s. 2d. voluntary rate and 251. 14s. subscriptions have been collected. The churchwsrdens are two quarters in arrears with salaries, &c., and have another quarter to provide for. The coalov'ners have nearly allrefused to pay; the farmers,with two exceptions, the same; the gas and water companies also refuse to pay the rate, and the manufacturers have likewise declined-to do so; some of the latter excusing themselvesbecause there is no accommodation in the parish church for their, foremen and workpeople. One of the county magistrates has not paid his rate for two years, though his family use the church. An agent of a considerable estate wil not pay, though his family attends church, because Quakers and Dissenters cannot be made to pay; and a large firm willnot pay the rate, one of the partners being a Dissenter, though e receives rent for a pew in the church, the other tvo partners being Churchmen. All these circumstances were stated at the meeting. It seems, further, that the Duke of NorthunberLand appropriates the tithes, some 4,0001. a-year; tbatthe vicar derives only about 3001. a-yearfromtheliving, wbich contains a parish church and twvo district churches and that he spends more money than he receives-fortuustely having a priate fortune; and that nearly all the pews in the church are held by private individuals, and sold or let by them like any other private property, not oue farthing of which money is appropriated to rhe maentenance of the fabric of the church or the decencies of worshi At the meeting a resolution wvas adopted for entering into a- subscription to defray the expenses for the necessary repairs of the churches, -and the decent celebration of serviee therein. It was also deClared that rcntas received from p ews in the church were illegal1, and could -not be enforced;and the meeting suggested the propriety of not paying these rents to private individuals, but to subscribe the amnountto the church; and that parsons wvho hold pew;s rent free lbe requested to contribute 3s. per sitting. All these resolutions were agreed to with the hope that the church-rate question rould be finally settled nexct session of Par]iamnent.

THE AND IOVLUEIO2rXO I IRELAND. :. .,I The Irish Encumbered Btates Comnission is now in its seventh year of office, and it will not be interesting to those who bave watched the worling of that remarkable tribunal to Live an example of the complete revolution it has effected, or rather is effectmng, in the agricultural and social condition- of Ireland. The counties of Galway a,nd Mayo contain 2,800,OO acres of land, or about one-seventh of the area of the island. In 1850 the landed proprietary of these two counties were perhaps the most hopelessly involved in IrelandL The solvenr excepRtions-were few, chiefly in the eastern portion. where wsme estates were comparatively free from enctmihiance, wvell cuiltured, and comfortably tenanted - while the remoS,er districts, including the great lakes and highlands of the far iest, exhibited littlemore than the prinitive elements of agriculture-tle land untouched by enterprise, iimproved by capital, and even 'its natural resources unnoted, except by the casual glance of tourists in search of the picturesque. Now, on every side are unsuistakeable signs of improvement and prores Many estates are being fur-nsled with well-constructed farmsteads, draine is beconing general, a higher style of fanning is adopted, and the vages of labour are more than doubled -within the last five years. 636,000 acres-i.e., about one-fourth of the available superficies of these twzo counties, have adready .-hanged hands, producing a total. sun of upwards of 2,000,0(00/.,' and petitions for sale are still iouring in unceasingly. The numler of proprietors over te extent sod has boeen increased fourfold, and about one-third are urchasers a an u nder 2,n001.; these, with the Eglish, Scotch, and Ulster farmers. settled on Clew-bay, and in various otler localities, Contributingto form the nucleus of an independent middle clss, the wnt of which has been hitherto so injurious to the political and social interests of this country. IAbout one-fifth of tlle whole numuber of purchasers are from the other side of the Channel; but though the English and Scotch have everywhere set a good example as farmiers !u occupation, they hal-e lnot as proprietors. generally speakun, raanaged their estateswith as much prudence and profit i-s iish purchasers. ''Thus the capital and skdlled industry of our British neighbours have been drawn to that region furthest removed in geographical position, as well as in industrial progress, from the seat of government and superiorcivilizatiorn It isgratfing to state that the improvement in our land market has enabled several of the onginsl proprietors to preserve a portion of their ancient inheritances, and they still reside among a tenantry by w%hom they are beloved and respected. Thenmineralresources and fisheries of tlo westhave not kept pace with agricultural progress, nor has the vast Waterpower of the great lakes 'ceen as y2t appropriated for mnanufacturingypurposes; indeed, little decide progress can Ie expected in these branches of industry until Connaught is permeated by a system of rilway communication from south to north, and Galway linked with the manufacturing province of Ulster. The Great Northern line will probably be soon commenced, and subsidiarybrauches vili followv, thus completing those physical aids to development of natural resources which facility and cheapness of transport invariably confer.

THE 1WFOIWA TORY AT .LETTIEAY. TO THE EDITOR OF TH1E TDIES. Sir,-You wvould be greatly obliging me lby finding a space for the following lines in your columns, for I am anxious shortly to explain what I believe to be the view vwhich the greatFrench autlhority upon the subject of juvenilereformation, ML De Metz, takes of our la-w as it now stands, and as itaffects young crininals. You did nic the honour to comiuent upon a letter of mine upon the Rlefonnatory a' MIettray, from a passage in wh'bich you drewr a conclusion in accordance with the meaning I intended it should convey,that the law, w hich now commits a boy to prison for 14 days at least, and, at all events before allowing him to enter a reformatory school, met with the disapprobation of Id De Metz. Xy friend, the Rev. Sydney Turner, comr ments upon your observations and uses these words -"I must solemnly protest against the phailathropic phrase of not stigmatizing the young criminal by imprisonment before you reform him;" and further-" With reference to XL De Metz's views on this subject, I know that as latelyas August last he was decidedlyin favour of prelimainary correction, not only as a safeguard to society, but as a means of moral impression aud improvement to the boy himself."1 Anxious to be supported by the testimony of a friend -who visited Mettray last November in company vith myself-a high authority himself upon such mnatters-I wrxote to him, before-taking notice of Mr. Turnees observations, to ascertain whether he had formed the same opinion as myself as to the li,ht in which Id. De Metz regards our lav. I quote from his reply:- " Although ML De Metz has more than once stated to me that he thought a short confinement in a separate cell, before a boy is sent to Mettray, was serviceable to his moral health, he has constantlv inveighed against what he considers the unwrise provision of our law,that children must be condemned, and su!bjected to punishment as criniinas, before they are sent to Teformatory schools. Indeed, he is so stronglv of tlis opinion, that he told me that one of the principal objects he had in view in visiting England next spring was to have an opportunity of impiessing this upon the leading people heie interested generally in the subJect, as he was satisfied that we should never arrive at all the sucess posible in the reformation of youth until tlle stigma of condemnation should have -been removed from them. - It is quite true that in almost every case the boys are -onfmfned before they are remnoved to Mettray; hbut they are sent for that purpose either to La Roquette, in Paris, which, to avoid the name of ' prison,' is caUed ' 'IMlaison d'Education Correctioninelle de Jennes DlCtenus;' or to? special 'qtuaitiers dorrectionnels' in the departmental prison-thus again advoidimg the injurious name." I have troubled yoiu, Sir, with these few Jines,hbeing anxious that, whatever may be the facts with regard to the letter of the French law, no -misapprehension should exist with regard to the spirit of it or'of IL De Ietz's views, and fearing that an inference might be drawm that 3L De Metz thinks conviction andpunlshinent should precede admission to a reformatory, whereas he really thinks our adherence to these conditions a fatal error. : - ' - I am, Sir. sour obedient servant. - LEIGH.

* 1 UBAL POLiCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TEM TheWestlliding . . Prefrrobbess topolkoemnery r "*Spectator," Des. 1s, 185. Sir,-The remarks of your reporter at the late York assizes bave called forth a reply from a-zgeatlemnarieU. known in theWestRiding as a warm opponent of the untro. duction of the rural police. Yowr correspondent, litr. T. Hasiings Ingham, 'as prevented attendingthe neeting Of the magistrates held at Wakefield on the 16th of October last, at which itwasproposed to establish the force, and-rsoi appeals tothepublic, jusifYingtherejection of the mefsure* especially against the comments that have been made rpnn it. Although I have no desire to rash into print, still flegs to be plunged-into any controversy, neverthelese, aa oi'e or those makistrates wvho, an mnentioned by your reporbte, expressed a strong opinion as to the amount 'of undetoctsA crime, I Would crave your indulgence wvhile I make a&Jew observations upon the subject lately liscusse- at Wak e ekl Your correspondent malkes an analysis of the calendz og the last York assiz, from which it appears tha,t, et 25 robberie, includingburglaries, 10 cane from theNorf1s.and East Ridings, 16 from three towns of the West Riding, Zi; two only " from what ought fairly and strictly to be called the West Riding, so far as a county police could be isa. blished." He also expresses. an opinion "that the p!rpetrators. of crime in the West Riding are detected and brought to tria fully as effectually as. in other ocuntes." The North and East Ridings, be it remembered, a6 wall a6 leeds, Sheffield, and Bradford, have each an efficient detective police of their own, paid out of tie public rates, *Wbhokeeptlewardarby antddAy"! The WestI tiding, "fairly andstrictly" so-called,hasbat the old ijrish constables, who keep no ward Whatever by night,andnotnauch morebyday. Isit, then,evenposable, while in- the -two PRdings 10, and ir .the three townas le of these crimes should have been detected, that througbeut the whole of the vast and often thickly-populate-digdstict in which these towns are situate two only should have -been cormnitted? Police or no police, it is all the- s4se,,rys -your correspondent, and because no crime in detected therefore no crime is committed. If the argumnent bW correct, a police force is worse than useless. It in mot only, costly, .bt .'.would appear to become a positive attration to the robber and the burglar; and the very facilitie.: for crime would seem to constitute the beet defence against. i commnission. I can only reply that I have not found it so. Here, a fewv miles from the Lancashire border, we are overrun with squatters, tramps, and vagabonds of ever:y description, who bave been made to "move on" by the L ancashire constabulary, and who accordingly have nmved on, and make high bolyday in the territory of the pxtish constable. On this, among other grounds, to iDe noticed herefter, therefore-since all money considerations are repudiated by your correspondent-the magistrates of the West Riding have now for the third time refused t,o establish tbe rural police. The second attempt to introduce it was rmnde in 1SoL A committee, of which your correspondent was a member, was appointed to consider and report how far it is desirable to adopt the establishment of the county and district police within the West. Riding under the 2d and 3a Victoria, c. 1)3. The report of this committee, dated October 3, 1851, and signed " W. B. Wrightson, chair-. man," was printed and circulated, and taken - into consideration atasessionholden at W5rakefield on the 3lst of October, 1851. Mr. Wrightson, on that occasicn, as in November last, mnade an unsuccessful effort to induce the mngistracy to establish the force. The report cf tbe committee contains a Large mass of information, iii t'he shape of returns fiom each of the 32 petty sessional divi. sions of the riding. From 16 of these divisions the returns directly assert that undetected crime exists in some divl!fons toa considerable extent. There appear to be 2,283 pa.riEl constables in the riding. By 12 divisions " default " is imputed to the constables; their number amounts to 1,110, or nearly one half of the -whole. By five divisions oaly, containing 410 constables, is such default express3y nega.. tived. The returs from 14 districts describe 1,357 constables as dissatisfied with their remuneration, whbile throsghoiottheriding it does not clearly appear that more than 7G are fully contented. The arguments of your correspondent were used in 1851' when, as on the last occasion, the WestRiidingwas described in terms of the wannest eulogy; in fact, as a sort of robderm Arcadia,-a model riding, a "' happy, happy land"' cf ino-. cence, simplicity, andpeace. A memberfortheriding-was " grateful for, nay, proud of' its stupendous morality, and your corre-spondent wornd up an eloquent exordium by declaring "that if ever there wasa time when it vas nnceissaryto place fuither and ad2itional restraint, and wateb over the mo-ements of the West Riding, that tinse was 'ihe present!" Yet, strange to say, that very speech closed,with a formal notice that the speaker would, at the next Pontefxact sessions, move that a superintendent constable, undec the provisions of the 5th and 6th and 13th and 14th of 'Victoria, should be appointed in each petty sessional division, and a lock-up provided, ko. This motion was carried. feece the 30 superintendents who are mentioned by yonri cor. respondent, and who owe their appointment to the very gentleman who scouted the idea that any further watch aaza wara were requisite. Some years ago a mixed force of this nature was tried ia lancashire, and failed. Sinmilar failures have been reper,'d elsewhere. Ithasalways appeared to sue as apuremak2shift. What its fate may be in the West Riding craa scarcely be matter of doubt when it is stated that each of these superintendents has inder his charge some 30 townships, 70,000 acres of land, a population of 38,000, and property rated at 140,0001. Criminal statistics are greatly relied upon by your oorrespondent and others in support of their opiniions as to the compamtive state of crime in the West aiding. These statistics, however, treat only of committals, the numbehr of which within any given space must depend greatly'upora the nativity and efficiency oF a detective porioe. In. order to form an accurate judgment as to the relative criminality clE two counties, it nius fir-st be showiv that efficiency oe tbe police is equaL Should the one possess a strong and Iiighly organis2ed force, while the police of the other remains prett much as it was in the days of Alfred or the feptarch'y, DO trne test of tho comparative criminalitg is obtaioable. Worth ahd South Lanicasire admit of an accurate icomparison, but the West Riding cannot be placed in true contrast with Lancashire, nor with StaffordshJire. The puhbli statistics, nevertheless, are highly'nseful and instrnitive, and they serve conclusively to show the yearly increase or decrease of crime in the same district. On reference to Mr. IRedgrave's tables it wil be found' thatin England and Wales the nunmber of committals diring the five years ending 1848 was 135,134, and duriij the five years ending 1853 137,156. In Yorkshire, during these periods, respectively, -the nunbers were 8,4*) ancl 10,262: It is therefore evident.that the increase ef crime is this count accounted for alisost the entire increaseot6crvable in t he return for the wholea kingdom. As Lanoashirel seems to be a favourite standard, I may also add 'hat Mr. Redgrave shows a progressive increase in the number of Yorklshire committals far exceeding that of Lancathire. Should this inerease go on :mucli lbuger, the Wes. Itiding.will, I fear, ere long be wicked eisbonugheveu for a,Troral lpolice. .Youre. correspondent'quotes, not for £heutime, *g saying of h[r.

The list here given displays a few novelties-32-gun frigates Nwith the power of 131-gun three-deckers! Surely there nust be awful waste of power in such apporti6nment. All gunboats from the 1st of January inst. are to be independent commands and commissioned as such, not as tenders to otier ships, as last year; each will have a crew of 3G mnon and officers. This will create much more emulation than the old system, and more desire to do valuable service. All ships having more than four lieutenants are to be re. dluced one, as there is a deficiency of actnal officers of that grade. All 50-gun frigates are to have commanders added to their staff. Vice-Adrniral of the Red Sir George Seymour, KC.B., G.C.H., commenced his duties as Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth yesterday. He w-ent on board his flagship, the Victory, and was received with the uisual honours by Captain Gordon and officers; he afterwards embarked on the steam-tender Fire Queen, and steamned round the fleet at Spithead, whence he steamed into harbour and made a rimilar cursory inspection. The steam-transport Indiana, No. 147, embark-ed at Portsmoutlh dockyzard on Tussday a large quantity of stores for varions draughts of regiments which she was embarking yesterday, and wiU complete to-day, for service in the East. After the 31st of December last aU naval officer' pay-biUs are ordered to be drawn "seven days after sight," instead of " three days," as heretofore-a change which will be both asn inconvenience and a loss to the officer, as the merchants charge discount now, which we are informed they did not do before. The officers of the Pearl, Devastion, and Intrepid, lying in Woolwich bssin, have joined in large numbers, but, in consequence of the increased demand to man the numerous gunboats and other vessels now fitting out there, a great difficulty is experienced in raising the necessary crews. The gunboat service is progressing rapidly, all the labourers in that department being employed extra hours. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-G. F. Parker, Naval Instructor to the Conqueror; Ebenezer Waymouth, Acting-Clerk to the Impreg. uable; Arthur Hughes, Assistant-Clerk to the Seahorse; Godfrey Foster, Assistant-Clerk to the Devastatign; Charles H. Stone, Assistant-Clerk to the Victory; Edward TisdaU, Assistant-Clerk to thie Waterloo; Albert Ollar, AssistantClerk to the Fisgard; and George B. Westcott, AssistantClerk to the Impregnable. The recruiting for the army in Glasgow and the outstations (exclusive of Edinburgh) has been unprecedentedly successful in the year 1855, just closed.

The above does not include thme enlistments for the militia.

TEE E mmmE1fE s I BY A SUFERIN-TENDT OF POLICE-The late Superintendent of Police at South Shields was tried at the Durham Sessions on Monday last on a charge of having -fraudulently embezzled divers sums of money, the moneys of the Mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of South Shields. The particulars of Buglass's defalcations have already appeared in Vie Tivies. there were several indictrments against him; but, the jury returning a verdict of Guilty on the first charge, no evidence was offered in tne other cases. A legal objection was taken by counsel (M3-. Davison, who appeared for the prisoner), but it was overniled by the bench. The jiry, in returning their verdict, recommended the prisoner to mercy, on the ground -that "he had previously bornea good character, and that he had faLlen ino difficulties." The Chairman sentenced the prisoner to one year's lhard labotur, and remarked that t positiOn of the prisoner v-as such that he, of all others, ought not to have cqmmitted such offence as he had,
THEBE RsGELEY POISONING CASE. - The adjourned ineuest was Cresumed yesterday Wcdanes-. diy) tpdn the bodies respectively of Walter Palmer and I Diary Palmer-the former the deceased brother, and the latter the late wrife of Palmer, thze sporting surgeon of Rage- ley, who is now in Stafford Gaol, awaiting his trial at the I next assizes for the county of Stafford, charged with the murder of M1r. J. C. Cook, late of Lutterworth, in Ieicestershire. On Tuesday, however, Professor Taylor, of Guy's Hospital, London, to whom the stomach and intestines of Cook were submitted, and who, in conjunction with Dr. Roes, is now prosecuting an analysis upon that portioni of the remains forwardedtobhniofthe two deceasedrelatives of the prisoner, comnunicated to Mr. Hatton, the chief of the Staffordshire police force, that himself and his colleague had not yet fully completed their experiments, indertaken witlr a view to ascertaining the existence or otherwise of poison in the remains ef the two deceased; and he should, therefore, be glad if the inquest could be yet further adjoumed. This information wvas inuediately conveyedI to Mffr. W. Wr. Ward, the coroner for Stafford and the district in which Rugeley is embraced, wlho, upon the reassembling of the jury, commnunicatedl to them the purport of the message and the desire that had been expressed by Dr. Taylor. 7fihe .jury, wiho have been selected from men of known intelligence and .social standing in the neighbourhood of Rugeley, mnanifested the utmost readiness to await, till however protracted a period, the maturing of experinients w^hich involved consequences of so weighty a nature; and after some formal nd other minor proceedin, which M)r. Ward, the coroner, in conjunction with the jury, thought necessary, the inquest was adioured. Mir. Hatton, the chief constable, ;Mr. Bergen, the superintendenit of the district; and Mr. Ellis Crisp, the inspector of Rugeley, who are the chief officers of police enpged in this important case, continue unwearied in their efforts to sift out ant facts which are lilcely to throw light u1pon an anfair which is at present enshronded in so much mystery. Persons of all classes display a readiness to aid them hi every way required, and it is hoped that the publication in Tlhe Times of the description of the notestliathavebeenimpounded will tend verygreatly to the discovery of what has become of the 1,0001. wlich Cook had wNithl him when he -was conveyed to Rugeley, after being dosed by Pahuer at Shrewsburv. Cook's betting-book, the nature of the entries in which, when inquirice respecting it were made in Palmer's presence, appeared to be so wel known to hin, is yet undiscovered. By direction prncipallv of the several assurance societies which together were required at Walter Palmer's death to hand over, on account of policies granted oii his life, the very large sum of 23, OW., Inspector Field, formerly of the London detective force, is now in tho neighbourhood of Rugelcy, affording his professional aid to the local constabulary; and ahrea%y his well-directed exertions have been by no means fruitless. Inspector Field experiences considerable help in his present inquiries by the iiivestigations, extending over six weels, wlhich he made not a great wlhile since, at the instalnce of his present principal employers, when Palmer made a proposal to insure to a very large amount the life of an individual who proved to be a mere labourer in his employ, and to which proposal papeor the unhappy man Cook was a wtitness. I n legal circles, .and by those who have vwatched the issue of cases of this description, there does not, by any means, exist an .assurance that the facts, as at present developed, .afford reason.able ground for the expectation tha.t At his trial Pslier will be convicted of the murder of Cook. This doubt is not lessened as it beconies generally understood that at his trial the prisoner vill have the assistance of the learned Scrjeant whose ability in such cases has recently been so conspicuously shuoN-i at Durham. Serjeaiit Wilkins, it is asserted, has been specially retained to defend Palmer at tIe next assizes for Staffordshire. Within the last few days coiisiderable additional light has been thrown upon the transactions of William Palmer with the various life assurance offices of the metropolis. The foUowinigfacts maybe relied on as autlentic. It appearsthat in the early part of 1855 Mr. Walter Pahner, the brother of the accused, called at the Prince of Wales Assuranceoffice, Regent-street, accompanied by Mir. Pratt, who he stated to be his brother Wiiam's solicitor, and intimated his vwish to insure his own life for 13.000Y. From inqui 'es then inade it was ascertained that 'Mr. Palmer had been sufferina from ddtiriun hymrencns, and the office therefore declined to grant the policy unless at aii increased rate of i-emium . It was stated on that occasion that Mr. William Palmer and his mother had both advanced money to Mr. Walter Palmer, and that the policy would be eventually assigned to Mrs. Pablier as security for such advances. The life was vitimatelyaccepted, and in the month of Februarylast the first premium was paid by a check of Mlr. Pratt, the family solicitor; but it has since transpired that the money to pay the check wras found by William Palmer. The commission was allowed to M1r. Pratt, as the solicitor or agent bringing the business. The Prince of Walesoffice, notvwishing to take so heavyv a risk wholly anon themselv-es alone, divided the responsibility wvith 21 other offices, retaining for thenisolves only 5001. In the month of Juno followin two other assuratnces, eauch for 13,000!., were offered to the Indisputable anid A\then.-eni officesq, but they both declined them, the latter office having already taken part of the risk from the Prince of WFales. On the 15th of Au"ust last Walter Palner died, and immmediately afterwards notice was given to the Prince of Wales office. An assignment wavs also sent of which no previouis notice had been given at the office, although it waS allerd that a formal notice of assignment had already been delivered there. The assignment was not to 3Mrs. Palnier, as first alleged by the decssed Walter Palmer, but turned out to be in favour of William Palmer, the accused, and the 'consideration was stated to be 4001. It has since transpired that the only loan from William Palmer to Walter Palmer vas one of W0!. Before the period for paying tde claim arrived the directors of the Prince of Wales Assurance-office received a letter from a Person in Staffordshire, wlho alleged that William Palmer had used him badly, and containing information which led them to suspect that die deceased had died ub n rfair means. Relying on tlis information, Mr. Homby, tha actuary of the Prince of Wales, put himself into communication with the other offices sharing the risk, and the result of their deliberations was the formation of a committee, of which Mr. John Mess.at, of the Briton-office, was ap;Pointed secretary, for the purpose of obtaining evidence, with the view of ascertaining whether the suspcious crc.nstances were of sufficient gravity to justify the offices in resisting any deinand that might be made upon d lem il respect to the payment of these claims. In pursuance of this arrangement, Mr. Hornby, accompanied by Mr. Deane, of the firm of Chubb, Deane, and Chuhb, solicitors, of Gray's-inn, and by Field and Simpson, detective officers, proceeded to Staffordshire to obtain information as to the habits of the deceased, and the connexion of William Palmer with his pecuniary affairs. On arriving at Rugeley the party proceeded to make inquiries, the result of which was, that they ascertained that William Palmer was the person really interested in the policy of assurance in question, and that he had also been in the habit of maldng prepositions for insurances to several London offices, and that he had received 13,000!. from the Norwich Union, Equitable, and Sun offices on the life of his wife, who had died a short time previously under very nysterious circumstances. The deputation having been informed that William Palmer had made a proposal for insarin- the life of " George Bates, Esq.," inquired at the post-ofice for "George Bates, Esq.," and were informed that he would be found at Mr. Palmer's ; that he was a gentleman, and that, in all probability, he would gve "the gentlemen from London" a bottle of old wine, as e had a capital cellar. Field then proceeded to Rugeley, and, to his amazement, found " George Bates, Esq., wwho had been representedasa gentleman of property and position in the county, inx the act of cleaning out Palmer's stable. Field inquired whether he was Mir. George Bates?s Hereplied in the affirmative. A conversation ensued, in the course of which Mr. Field said, " Iunder6tand yon are going to insure your life. For what amount do you intend to insure ? Bates replied that he had left all that to Mr. Palmer, but that he was to have some money for himself, the amount of which he did not state. Field subsequently had an interview with Wlliam Palmer, whom he informed that the object of his visit was to obtain information respecting the death of his brother Walter. Palmer then expressed himself perfectly satisfied, and added that the insurance offices had a perfect right, and were, in fact, bound, to make every possible inquiry in order to satisfy themselves as to the justice of all claims made upon them. Field subsequently alluded to the mysterious death of Palmer's wife, and said that perhaps, he wouldhave no objectiontoinquiriesbeing madeb theNorwvich Union, Equitable, andSnn officesintothe circ stances attending her death? Palmer rephiedwith great coolness, thathe couldhavenopossibleobjectionto such a proceeding if the offices desired it. The subsequent inquiries made byMr. Ho-nby, Mr. Deane, and the officers led them to the conclusion that Mir. William Palmer had induced the medical man, by false representations as to his brother's habits and general health, to fill up the documents forwarded by the assurane offices in such a way as to lead them to suppose that the life was one which they could safely accept. The result of the investigation made ir Staffordshire was, that the offices resolved to defend themselves to the utmost, on the gronnd of fraud, against any legal proceediams that might be taken by William Palmer or the representatives of the late Walter Palmer torecover the amount of the policies. Mr. Deane afterwards repaired to the Ile of Man, where he discovered that Walter Palmer had resided some time, and had suffered severely from attacks of dediriuin tremen, during one of which he had attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throst. No proceedings have as yet been taken aggainst the Prince of Wales office, or any of the other companies, to tecover the amount of the policy.
VACao;CY OP AN IMPORTAT OrncE.-We regret to announce the'dealth of Lieutenant-Colonel Bld, who held the office of Master of 'the Ceremonies for many years in this town, and was highly respected by the nobilitary and gentry. This is a more important office, in a fashionable place like Brighton, than at first sight it may appear. Vast numbers of the nobility and gentry visit Brighton in the course of the year. There are also a number ot parvenus, upstarts, and still more equivocal characters among our visitors. The Master of the Ceremonies is, or ought to be, acquainted-on visiting terns- ith everyafamily of distinction, andto beable ton reventthe intrsion into themof imprope peresone. In Brhrhton there are a great many private .eoir&se, dinner parties, ac., among our fashionable visitors and residents, and there are some persons, without any pretensions to mix in such society, always on the watch to get introduced to them. If any doubt be raieed as to the respectability of a stranger, recourse is to be had to the Mauster of the Ceremonies. There are, as, many public balls and balls in aid of the funds of charitable institutions. It is of great importance that persons of an equivocalicharacter, if thley find entrance .into these assemblies, as theymay when tickets canbe purchased, should not be able to pas themselves off for wihat they are not; and that the; younger branches of a respectable-family or, perhaps, of distinction, should be protected fromn the wiles of equivocal persons, mile or female. No one-can do this so efficiently as a well-informed, intellectual Master of the Ceremonies, possssimg an impeccable moral character, a ine sense of honour, and of gentlcmanly bearing. We have not. heard who is to be Lieutenant-Colonel Bid's succes-sor, nor do we know exactly with whom the appointment rests; but it is a matter of much importance to the higher classes and to whicb, no doubt, they will psF proper attention.- Brzighen E.a&inflac

I IliTSOLVENT DEBTORS COURT, Jan. 2. LN RE EBENEZER DAVIES. : (Bcforc lIr. Cornmissio)cr Munpn. 'I'is insolvent, who apphed under the Protection Acts, was the plaintiff in the aleged libel case, " Davies v. Pratt," which vwasan action against hle publisher of the Britleh Blanner newspaper. 'T'he matter was referred, and the award wes as against tilc insolvent, wvho petitioned to save an arest. The costs incurred by Mr. Pratt, as taxed, were 1,0831. 17s. 6d. The insolveneywas attributed to the award in the action. Mr. Sargoed appeared to oppose on the part of Mr. Pratt, and M4r. Iallanthie supp urted. MIr. SAne OOD iniforned the Court that it had been agreed that the long statement on the schedule opposite the debt of MIr. Pratt should be struck out, and in its place it should be simply stated that the samomt represented the costs inunrred by the defendant. The alteration would prevent a discussion, and there could then be no objection to the second sitting being appointed, when he should have to inquire into the di.sposition of some property. Mr. BALLANrSE, seaid, lie was originially concerned for Mr. Davics, and readily and gladly acceded to the proposal madc by iiis lcarned friend. Mr. Conunissioner MItTrr.y thought the best courso had been adopted, and ordered the final order day. 'The statement was obliterated, and the 23d inst. appointed for the final order. IN7 flE flnica. LT tEro The question in this easewas, whetller in a protection case an assignee could be appointed oni the day of the final or(der, or whether the appointment -was confined to the first examination or soine adjournment thereof ? Mr. NIcHOL,s said, the words of the act were declaratory, and not imperative. It would be a great injury if suell contracted view were taken of the statute. Mir. Conuniisioner M1unpay intimated his intention tb appoint ani assignee, although the application was not iiiade on the first exaniniation. He was aware that MAr. Coinmis sioner Phillips coiifined the appointiientrto thefirstheariiig, or some adjournment thereof. The Chief Commiissioner, however, cntertained a different opinion, and he (Mr. Corn missioner Mu7llrphy) thoug,ht the words hero- different mean big to thme one put on theni by Mr. Commissioner Philiips.

POLICE. MAxL-Srox'-I0s-os.A gentleman, who is offcllMy con. nected wvith 'hle Britis and Foreign Anti-Slavery So. ciety, Avaited upon the Lord 3fayor and introduced to tlle notice of his Lordshlip Philip Bailey, a native of Mars-land, who had purchased his manunmission from hiis master, and submitted that the public notice of the fact in the press (particularly in The Time) wvould be of essential service to the poor man in the event of the loss of the (lcumneilt, or of othier disaster, u his de. parture from England. The applicant said that Baleylhad labinred hlardI uintil hle had put topether $200, the price of his manumnission ; end, having paia that scm for his mnanumission, he. was anxious, npon the advice of the society, to appear before the Lord Mayor and to produce the document, the aclmowledgnient of which would bea record of the fact, and -would prev-ent any future inconvenience or embarrassment, and be respected as an adequ°ate authority br thbe Unite States. TTan LORD MAYoR said, he had every reason to believe that the press would mnost gladly notice an application of ttle kind, and certainly he would not hesitate to express his gratification at being ;utramental to the service of such a person as had made it. The document was then returned to Bailey, who retired, expressing his thanks to the Lord Mayor for the very kind maniLer in which he had been received. GtTLDHALC.-Thomas Clarke, a boy about 12 year. of age, was brought beforo AIderman 1 LNsIS for final ex amination relative to several charges of obtaining money from his master's customers by means of forged letters. The prisoner was committed for triaL Bowv-sTrsEr.-Mr. JAniancE was occupied for more th^n tlhree hours in investigating a charge preferred, at the in stance of the Excise Commnissioners, against 3ir. William Williams, late proprietor of the Black Horse, in Titchborne street, and his successor, Mr. William Baker, for "depositing and conceaaEng" three gullons of plain British spirits of iUicii niannfacture. It appeared that, before entering upon the management of the house upon hiis own account, 3Ir. Baker acted for a sliort time as manager for MIr. Williams, but the period at which this arrangement terminated was not very clearly defined. On the 25th of September, Mr. Baker being then the ostensible proprietor, the Excise officers visited time house for the purpose of examining the stock. In the bar they found a cask marked "spirits of wine," wluich on examination was found to contain tliree galons of a mixed spirit, 37-4 over- rooe. This thev at once declared to be iUieit. Mr. Baker eclared that he hadtaken it in stock of M1r. Williams; and aftervards said that, in fact, he was only Mr. Williams's servant. Mr. Wiliams here entered, and, in reply to the officers, said that he had pnrchased the spirits of Messrsm Harmnar and Pearson, rectifiers, and that they were genuiine. It was intimated at an early stage of the roceediags that the defence rwould be, on the part of Mr. iams, that the spirits wvere not illicit, but were an accidental mixture of vhisky and spirits of wine; and on the part of Mr. Baker, that lie had not at that tinme entered on the management of the busines, and that if there was any fraud he was not a part; to it. Mr. Lewis, on the part of the former defendant, closely cross-examined the officers as to the grounds of their opinion that the spirits were illicit, and not such a mixture as was alleged; a d created much amusement by making thien taste repeated numerous s-am plea of spkits, reaUy te sanie,g niti they became cofmp'letely confused and made also stated, in cross-examminbation,that the, csk wasou placed- Mr. Lewis uirged that there was no evidence that the spirit was what was understood by plain British spirit, or. t lat there had bcen any concealment in the meaning of thcact. He called- Edoward Wakeling, late celarman to Mr. Williams, who stated that a few days before Mr. Balcer came to the Black Horse he was instructed by Mfr. WliUiams to take stock. He found in the cellar sundry jars and bottles of spirits, which ha emptied into the casks ofa spirit of the same kinds. One jar contained about four gallons of what he supposed to he spirits of u-ine, and he put it into the cask in question, which contained spirits of w-ine. Mr. Pearson, of the firm of Harmar and Pearson, fled Cross-street, distHllers, gave his judgment that the samples produiced consisted of spirits of wine mixed with malt whisky. About fotur gaUons of whisky mixed with two or three gaUons of spirits of wine, at 43 overproof, would produce a mixture of about 39 overroof. Mr. Hollebone, valuer, stated that he was employed by Mlr. Williams to value the stock on the occasion of the transfer to Mr. Baker. Mr. WVatson valued for the buyer. He fosuid in the cask about seven gallons of spirits of vince 39.7 overproof. Mr. Watson remarked that it smelt as if it had whisky in it. It was a low degree of strength for s2irits of wine. Mrr. WVatson corroborated. MIr. JAiSDSNE tlhonght it had been clearly shown that this was niot "1plein British spirits," on which grun alone the information would faUl to the ground. Btunhde might go further amid say that it appeared very likely that the whole of the defence wvas true; that the mistake had been riiade by the cellarman as described; and that, as spirits of wine was not a thing that was drawn lik-e g,in, the mistake had not been discovered. Tle calclations of Mr. Peairson, as to proof, being suclh as pretty nearly to make up the result as shown by Mr. Hollebone, were a strong contirmnatlon of the defence. Under thcse circumstances he could certainly no' convict. The summons must be dismissed. Mr. Baker pleaded " Guilty" to a second summons, charging him with selling beer a-nd iritswithout a licence during the inter-al between his takig possession of the house and the complefion of the transfer. M1r. Dwvells', on the p art of the commissioners, said that, as the defebdant had pleadled " Guilty," he should onlyaskhiis Worship to inflict the mitigated penalty of 251., the lowest he had poxn-er to impose. The fine was mitigated accordingly. - 31xnRnonouoa-sgRErT.-From "P p. 0. H." 5h. has been received for the poor-box. WisT3rrxNSTER.-5l. li-a received from "T. T. "3 from " P. 0. H. ; 5. fiona " HI.

Sarah Thomas, a middle-aged woman, who was strapped up in vatlio-s places *.Nithibospitalbandages, and was so weak frWm les of biood that she wras obliged to be seated while -hying her evidence, stated,-I aim a widow, and live at a odging-honse in Epitalficlds, w'here the p:isoner also rents a room.

I bled p.-ofusely, end exclaimed that. 1 was cut, on which tihe prisonermadeasecond attempt to cut tmhy throalt, but I pat up my right hand, aned the knife cut By MIr. D'EYNCourT.--HO threw his left arm behind me over my left shoulder while he triad to cut my throat, and struck me with the blade as if right across. He then made salother attemnpt upon my throat, but I bent down my head to save it, and the knife cut me across the bridge of the nose between tlh eyes. There are three stiches hi the first worund. I don't know whether the last is deep, but the doctor sewed that up too. All this last occurred by the steps ii'r the strcet, just outside, and I called out repeatedly and screaniad. e tried to escape when the people carne out of the house, and walked away deliberately, saying "I have thrown the knife away, and the .- can't find it, but rll. cut her throat, or any one else's that interferes with me." A, young man came tip to help me, and I followed and seized the prisoner, trying to hold him, and scratched his face while doing so, and while struggling togetier aconstable appeared and took him. (The witness here became so exhausted that she was carried out of court. Sergeanbt Horan obse-inig that she had lost a vast quantity of blood from the various woundIs. On recovering aud being led in again, she stated,-) After the prisoner struck mo with the plate I did lay hold of Ids hlair, but I can't say that I was holdiig it when lie first strile me with the knifc. I -was taken to the London Hospital, wherc the doctor dressed my wvounds, told me they were very serious, and wislhed mne much to go into the hospital. M1r. D'Evx'counmt-And I think also that you had mnuch better go in directly, as the medical evidence will be produced on another oCCasion. A mana namied flarron, a lodger in tho house, described the horrible and insulting langu.age of the prisoner towards the woman, who caught hold of his jacket ; " On which," said the witness, " he wheclcd quickly round, and cut ber with the knife upoII th left arm, and then, without a word, mnade.a cut at her neck. She puit up her aim to guard her neckl, and lie next cut that, and then struck her again with the klife, vwhich broke lher hold of him, the bladle going down upon her nose, and she fell back. He wvalked quietly up the street, follon-.edl bly thc woman, wvho exclanied, 'Oh, stop blin, I ion cut all to pieces,' and I ran for a policeman. She lost a great dcal of blood, and, as I heard where the knlife fell, I pointed it out tothe officer. The prosecutrixisa sober woman, and is well known to be so." Sergeant Horan.-She Was quite sober when brought to the station. The prisoner is a beggar, and has been a sailor. Prisoner.-He calls me a beggar, while for a living I sell religious tracts; I am a niariner, 14 years at sea, and can't be a beggar, when Thh a seller. Ross, lS0 HS, prodneed the knife, which he had foumd down a grating four feet deep, ond 20 yards from the house. Itwas a blade four inches iong, with an acute point, sharp cued half way downz both the back end front, .and was fixed into a strong wooden handle. Hooley, 412 A-I took the prisoner in Brick-lanc,7Smrrounded by a crowd of persons. He was the worse for liquor, but could walk steadily; and when I charged hun wththe tl offcnce lie said, "What did the- scratch my face fort" There was a scrateh on Isis face, but the complainant was bleeding from both her arms and face. The prisoner, who conducted hiiimself with an air of coarse defiance throughout, rrsen-ed his defence, and he was committed until that day trok-, that the result of the injuries inflicted upon the woman might be correctly ascertained. CLERnEINrVELL.-Ihomas Clapshaw, residing at 34, Woodland-street, Dalstons, and Jamnes Sinnmonls, of 33, Woodland-street, Daiston, were placed at the bor before Mr. TvsR ,nTTr, charged with obtaining money under false gretences from bTr. John Haynes, of 10, Cambrian-villas, outhgate-row, Da Be.auvoir-town. Mr. Thoomas Thompson attended for tho prosecution, and from his statement and the evidence of the -witnesses it appeared that the prosecutor in this case tvas MIr. James Harticy, of the British and Foroigmi Stea. '-harf, Lower East Smithfield. On the 24th of Decembler a i. : hamper arrived from Cork addressed to Mr. J.

" charges at Cork," and Is. Gd. for "Tor I .iayor it" both of which were fictitious charges. Mlr. Ilh ynes. upon looking at the bill, found that the above twvo itmis v-o in made in different coloired1 ink, and that the total ilad iot bcunaltered to corresponId with the figuresthat lad *eeu added. He spoko to the prisoners upon the suibject, when they said the charges vere correct, having been paid at the wharf; that all thepy demanded wvas is. for carriage ; and that they shiould not give it uzp unless the 7s. Gd. Was paid. The money taes paid, and upon inquiries being made tlio charges were found to be false:- and upon the constable seeing the two priosi,ois in their caricrs' cart at the Old Bailey, Sinumonds said he did not call for parcels in Blshopsgate.street, and Clapshaw denied all knowledge of the afiair until lie was taken to tise house of the prosecutor, when lie adnuitted that he was one of the men who delivered the parcel. Mr. Thompson asked for a renmand, stating that it uras most iniportant to the public that these offences, which. lie was afraid, vere getting rather common with persons in the prisoners' class of life, should be put a step to. 31r. TYRnvmVlTr, the prisoners having nothing to say in their defence, said, the mnatter w. as one of some importance to the public, and he should therefore remand tlhem until Tuesday wveck, but wvould have no objection to take substanVal bail. The necessary bail not being forthconinsg, the prisoners were sent to prison. Tn.Ams.-Catherine Galvin, a girl aged 14 years, and the daughter of a Cestoin-louse officer, was brought before Mr YARDLEY, charged with stealing a sovereign. Mlfary Aunn Galvin, an elderly woman, the stepmother of the prisoner, said, the girl had very frequently robbed her anid her father, and had been as often forgiven. On Tuesday soning she laid a pocket apron containing a sovereign on the table, and soon afterwards missed it. She gave information to the polce, and the girl was taken at the house of her sister-in-law. Poliee-constable George Osborn, No. 129 K, stated that when lie took the prisoner into custody, she said she ha(l stolen the sovereign, and had given 7s. lid. and a shilling to a Gipsy Avoman for a charm, spent 5s. for two novels, left 2s. Gd. at abooksaller's shop for another novel, and spent the rest in ribands,and finery. lie. YAaDLEV.-Where is this charni ? W'itness.-Tlis is it, Sir.

Tlhe prisoner.-I met the Gipsy woman osi the Rhodeswell-bridge, near the Stepney raiworks, and she said the charm would save me from all harm. M1r. Y,urDLEY.-And this is the precious charm, is it? (Holding up the card.) The prisoner.-Yes, Sir, it is. Mr. YARDLEY.-Despair thy charm, for I shall certainly punish you for tlhis robbery, and I wish the inspudenit Gipsy was here, as I would punish her too. Is the prisoner inown ? Rochb, the gaoler of the court, said, the history of the prisonier was a most painful one. She was brought before his WVorshipthreeyearsand-a-halfago,whenshepreferredaeharge of felony against tlhree persons for stoaling some earrings, and it came out in evidence that she had stolen the rings and pawned them herself. Mr. YAIDLEY.-I recollect the case well, and her own mother vas alive then. Roche.-Yes, Sir; and she was brought here 12 nonths ago for sobbiing her father. was remanded, and, upon his intercession, was discharged on the second examinaton with an admonition from your Worship. DMr. YARDLEY.-And her father, who has often beenhere both in his official capacity and to complain of this very bad girl, is a most respectable man, I believe? Roche.-He is, Sir, and he has had much trouble with his daughter. Mr. YArDLEY said, the prisoner might select to be tried by a jury or by himn. The prisoner. -I will be tried by yoe Sir. Mnr. YA1DLZY.-Did von take the sovereign or not? The prisoner-I ldid, 1ir. Pray forgive me. 31r. YARDLEY said, he could do ao Suchthing.

The prisoner had lastly stolen a sovereign, .and spent it as foolishly as she possibly could do. A more wiacked and incorrigible girihad never been arrajned before hLis since he was a magistrate. He convicted her of larceny, and sentenceed her to two months' imprisonment and hard labour.

He walked along as far as the Artichoke Tavern, when he stopped and asked her what she wanted. when all of a sudden a man rushed up behind hbil, seized him by the neck, and tripped him over. He fell down very heavily, and the prisoner then stooped down and took the bag containino- the money from his trousers' pocket. The man ran ok at that time, and before he coud recover himself the prisoner bolted across the road. He pursued her, calling out "Police t" and "Stop thief !" when a constable came upand secured her. Mr. CoaEsx.-Did you speak to her after she first accosted you? Prosecutor.-I told her to go away, as I did not want to have anything to do with her, but she persisted in following me, which caused me to stop near the Artichoke, and askher what she wanted, when the man tripped me up, and she robbed me. Mr. Coaam-Did you see the ian come up towards you?Prosecutor-X did not see him approach, but I saw him when he was close behind me, and then he seised e i ry. roughly and tri!{ed me up.
