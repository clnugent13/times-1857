MfONZY-WABKEZ aa OJTrYIjZELLIG1EjG g.-
oTuesdaY Evening.
The quotation of tgold at Paris is about 6 per mille premnium, and tie short exchange on London is 25.25 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. p)er ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-10th3 per cant. dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London' is 13.3 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 7-lOths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' night is 108k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between lIe two eountries, Bhows that the exchange is against England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmision of gold either way between England and America
The Bank of England aclopted a further slight restriction to-day, which had the effect of increasing the heaviness of the stock-market. In ordinary times they discount bills not having more than three months to run for the bill brokers in the samie manner and on the same terms as for the public.' This afternoon, however, they gave notice that the accommodation would be limited to bills having not more than one month to run, and that on bills of longer date they would only make advances for a b'rtnight.
This limitation is not in any way to apply to the public at large, all ordinary mercantile applications being still freely metat 64 pereent. During the ensuing 10 days the amounts repayable to the Bank will be extraordinarily great, and if these should be met in any considerable proportion without a call for renewed assistance the restrictions adopted yesterday and to-day will probably soon be rescinded. The object of the Bank evidently is to keep themselves free during the next fortnight to take any measures that the course of events 'may render necessary. Within that time the effect of the dividends and'tho prospect of a partial retention of some of the Australian gold arrivals will have been ascertained. Further advices will also have been received which will help to indicate whether we are to continue sending gold to all parts of the world to obtai the requisite supply of silver for each fortnightly Indian maiL. Any course that may then be presented may be expected, therefore, to assume some degree of permanence. Meanwhile it will be an advantage if the step now interposed with regard to bills of long date should induce all persons in the uncertainty that prevails to weigh well the responsibilities of protracted commitments.
The English funds opened this morning at a decline of an eighth from the price to which they receded yeaterday after regular hours, and suibsequently experienced a further fall, from which there was only a a partial reaction. Consols for money, which closed last evening at 92J to J, were first quoted 92i to i. From this, m consequence of some large speculative sales for the MIay account, they went to 92A. A ralIy then occurred until there were buyers at J2i, but the closing transactionswere at 920 for money and 93k for the 7th of May. Attention was occupied by the preparations for the settlement, which takes place to-morrow. and the demand for money at from 6i to 7per cent. to carry on purchases to the next account be3ing fully as great as had been anticipated, the market throughout the day was without any appearance of stability. The realizations effected, however, since the fall first commenced must have brought it to a more healthy condition than it has presented for some time past. Bank Stock left off 216 to 218 ; Reduced, 91# to i; New Three per Cents., 914; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to ga; India Bonds, 6s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills (June), 6s. to 2s. discount; (March) ls. discount to 3s. premium.
There was again great activity in t,he discountmarket to-day. The applications at the Bank were also said to be very numerous. This, however, was to be expected, looking at the amount of the advances to be repaid to that establishment to-morrow and in the next few days.
Foreign securities have not been largely dealt in, but continued sales have caused a further decline. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 97* and 961, and the Four per Cents., guaranteed, for the account, at 100I and J. In Mexican for money the transactions were at 23, and for the account at 23*, 23, and 234. The general business comprised-Buenos Ayres, 86; Peruvian, for account 77; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44B and 45i; llussian Four-and-a-Hal per Cents., 954 andi;Sardinian Five per Cents., 90Spanish New Deferred, for account, 25 and 24, Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 656; and the Four per Cents. Ciicates, 961 and 7i.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was an advance in the rates upon all the principal points.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 80c. for money and 69f. 30c. for the end of the month, showing another fall of a half per cent.? moncy being very scarce, and the market in its present speculative condition sensitive to the least uifavourable movement upon this side.
The specie brought by the last West India packet and a portion of the recently announced arrivals from Australia were delivered in London to-day. 21,0001. was sold to the Bank, but it is said that a nearly similar sum was withdrawn in Arerican gold coin. Further sums of Australian gold are expected to be taken to the Bank, but at least twothirds will probably be withdrawn for the Bank of France and for silver purchases on the Continent.
It appears that several of the recent steamers to New York have taken out amounts of gold ranging from 20,0001. to 60,0001. These shipments as mere exchange operations would involve a loss, and it is therefore conjectured they may have been for transmission to Mecxico or Cuba in payment for silver.
The 40,0001. of gold brought by the Africa to-day from America is all on account of the Bank of France, but the tendency of the rate of exchange with this country was becoming slightly more favourable, and the prospect is still entertained of remittances hither being resumed before the lapse of many weeks. The New York stock-market had experienced numerous fluctuations, and the tendency of prices was downwards. Erie Railwaywas quotea 53 - Reading, 79; Panama, 941; New York Caentraf 89- and Illinois Central, 32 pm.; the bonds, o01J to '102. The arrivals of gold from California during the first quarter of this year had been 360,0001. lessthan those in the corresponding period of 1856. Positive statements were stiU circulatec that the United States' Government have proposed a new treaty with Mexico, involving the purchase for 3,000,0001. of the north-weatern provincesof Sonora; Sinaloa, and Lower California, 1,200,000Z. of the amount to be retained for the satisfaction of American clims. The establishment of a line of postal steamers between New Orleans and Vera Cruz ii also alleged to be included in its provisions. it i to be hoped however, that General Comonfort will not be alowed to 'sel further portions of his country without due regard being had to the .rlght~ of the English creditors, who have a lien upon all its reaources.
At Lloyd's to-day insurance premiums of 16 guineas and 15. guineas were paid upon a portion of the gold by the Oneida.
The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that, although business was less active, prices continued to be well
supported. The operations in coffee and sugar had been moderate, owing to the cessation of Wpecula' Mive purchasss. In tea no great variation had ocL
curred, but rates exhiibited diminished buoyancy, The letters from Rouen mention that the market for
manufactures was inanimate for the season, and that in most branches complaints were made of the limited amount of purchases.
At a meeting of the Governor and Company of Copper Miners in England, held to-day, Sir X. H. Pelly presiding, dividends of 78 per cent. on the
preference stock, and of 3 per cent. on the. con. solidated stock, free of income-tax, were declared, and the report and accounts were unanimouily
adopted. It was stated that, in consequence of n wish expressed by the proprietors to, have tho, accounts eirculated beforehand the Court bayo found it necessary to close-the books at an earlioi date than usual. The operations includedinthe?re.

ment and to make a careful -nd 6xact vahlb i4of
the stocky property, 3/ The :result of business
shows a net profit of $1K941t., .which the g6yerntor and Court regard as exeedingIy favourable; ?considering that during a part 'of thb' peri6d 'the!;has
been aomedepression both in the copper and theiron trades. A full investigation has been made into the accounts in London and into the stocks of copper, iron, tinplates, &c., and they are found to be in every respect satisfactory. The Court have also instituted a ri'id inqui into the condition of the stock edger, the unclaimed dividend account, and the transfer department, the whole of which are in regular order. The comipiny continue the principle of paying cash for all purchases, with the exceptionof copper ore; and, as they are now free from litigation, the charges for professional assistance will ahortlyterminate. During the last year the amount incurred was only 251., but a sum remains to be liquidated owing to previons costs. The capital account is considered virtually closed, and any outlay for improvements, &c., is charged against revenue, the total, when requisite, being spread over a pernod. The dividends are to be paid half-yearly, one half on the 27th inst., and the other on the 27th of October next. In answer to questions, it was stated that the present dividend on the Consolidated Stock being 1 per cent. above that declared last year, the Court have not thought it expedient to propose a further fractional distribution of the surplus amount representing less than one-half per cent. Annexed are abstracts of the accounts:

Thelhalf yarly meeting of this company s held ye6terday atthe ndon Tavern* -Mr. ZR. enson in the chi
TheCBRETARY read the minutes of the hlst meeting, which were confirmed.
The report stated that the directors in their last report announced their expectation that the first sectlon of the rilw&ay would be ope-. for trsffic by midsummer next, lbtwitstanding the occurrence of some temporry delays relating to the sation at the'terminus at lecife, some diffi. culties connected with the bridging, and the stbetitution of iron for wood sleepers for a portion of the line the directors have every reason to hope that the frst section of tho railway will be opened considerably within the period allowedfor its completion by the contract, in addition to which they have determined to commence the works of the second section prior to the completion of the first, with a view to an augmented amount of traffic, which it is anticigated will arise from it. The works have pro. cesdedwit ve ydight initeriuptions ; free native labour continues abunln, and the natives employed ane becoming daiy more ldiled and efficient. With ono slight exception the engineer reports that all hi saff are invery good health, and are all satisfactorily executing the work in their respective departments. Sinoo the ast half-yearly meeting some changes have taken place in the oompany's executivo abroad. The manager, r. b;. de Mornay has returned home;and the treasurer,aor theIHon. S. P Verekerr, i. aso resigned his post. In hisplae the directors have appointed Mr. J. Templeton Wood, who left for Brazil in February, and will, in addition to the office of treanurer, fill for the present that of manager also. In consequence of the consltative committee ceusisting for the present of onl two embers, the directors have recently requested his Excel. lency the President of the province to afford to them the benefit of hisjudgmient and friendly intervention in case of doubt or difference on auestions which may at any time arise with referenoe eitfer to the administration of the company's affairs in the Brazils, or to the engagements entered into by the company with the land contrar;ors or others. The directors trust this asociation of his Excellency with the administration of the company's affairs, will be viewed by him and by the Government whom he representes M a further proof of the arnest desire of the directors and shareholders to fulfil every obligation oontracted.b the company with the most serupulous integrity and good fath The answer of his Exoellency has not yet been received. The directors have the cordial c-operation of his Ridellency the Brazilian Miister in this coomtry, from wrhom they have received nauranoeg that the warmest interest continues to be evinced towards the underttking by the Imperal and provineial Governments. Mr. C. EL.Gregory

He believed that some aitrieo had been expressed as to the sufficlency of the capital, but they hbd not thought it necessary to allude to it in te report, as their experience had satisfied them that the-
sources would be sufficient to complete the 11*., 4he margin they had allowed on their .estieate hadhei. creasing, instead of dimiinishing. (Hear, hear.)'0 os, the amonnt of capital in hand was large, a it we

Mlajor Vereker had retired in conaequenc2 of illness in his fiamily and of some diffreicea-0 with aiother member of the executive. Mr. de Mornay, the manager, had come over, and stated his view to -the board as to the management of the undertaking, but the beard did not agree with hima in those views. M.Pent4on and Mr. Wood would be sufficient to manage the affairi at prmnt. The directotr -would try and have, a i nno

There would be some difficultr I in the matter, as the documents were very voluminout. With regard to the tri it was'oIs.Hic tons e mile-five or six times the amount ebarged or Englh railways. With regard to the expenditure, the Bra .
Minister bad had ow e toobrec toa ite u. There was ino doubt that all. l te or the railway would' b Incltded in the gsumarnted by the Government. o
Mr. KENNARD, a director, stated thait he,ws in no wray interete.ed In the contract of Mr. Furness. Ag to the question Of Material, it Was for the offcrs of the cmpany to determine whether they were properly supplied or-mot.

After some observations as tothe adoption of iron sleepers on a portion of the line,
The CnrATxws said he had no hesitation in stating the, Mr. Kennard had nothing whatever to do with the adoption of the iron sleepers; it was because they could not het the kind of wood for sleepers that would resist the white mnt that they adopted them. Iron sleepers were adoptecl in Egypt, and were about to be used in India. The sleepers they usedawere Greave's patent, which were strongly recommnended.
Mr. Dx CASTRO, a director, explained that iron sleepers had been used with success on a small line abroad of ninek miles in length, in which he was interested. The sleepers were covered. with a composition of pitch and. spirit, which
prevented oxidation,The consultingengineer of the Blm~y~wa had trongy recmmened the laying down of ironsleepers onfa section of .0 m s .of railway in India, and t would beunfortunate i it wa n..ot sanctioned. 1

ST'ATE OF TRADE.
MANCHESTEB, Aamm 7.
There is not quite so much business in shirtings maq. pollams, and jaconets suitable to the India makets an on thiR day week. The advance made by the Bank on the rate of discounts has affected this trade more than others, frbm it being mostly carried on by means of long-dated paper, on whica the effect of higher discounts is felt more severely. There is a fair business in T-rloths, longcloths. and aome descriptions of heavy narrow domestics, at very full pries, and the demand may be regarded, on the whole, as quite equal to theproduction. In yarn there has also beed a moderately good demand from the home trade, but more especially for 30's water twist and 40's euule for Russia, and these arc fully id. per lb. higher than on this day week. Most numbers and qualities of yarn are more or less affected in price, and the market generally may be regrded- as firmer than it was lat week.

The home demand for laoe is manifesting a further improvement, but not to the extent anticipated. Plain goods are still in request, at high prices. More is doing in silks and fancy laces, and, although the high rates; ut which both silk and cotton are sold require the manufacturer.to proceed with caution, it is generally believed in the tzade that the season will be a busy one.
The hosiery trade oontinues good. For a long time put this branch has been active, both with home and foreigi orders.

Adulteration Of Bread.
ADULTERATION OF BREAD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I fear that the adulteration of bread is practised at tho present tlme to an alarming extent, and especially in those qualities of bread whioh are sold at a low price.
I bave st present before mo a particle of suphate of lHme as large as a pea, which I met with by acident in a loaf of broad purchased in one of the largest bread shops in the poorer porton of the sonth-westenm district. I trust the Board of Health will bestir themselves, and adopt measures to prevent such a dangerous system of knavery. It is also to he hoped that a more strict watch may be kept over the quality of the chief necessaries of life.
Some time ago it was reported that diseased cattle, which ad either died from their distemper or had been kiled only to anticipate nature, wero flling the markets with cheap butchers' meat, and that a commission of inquiry had beon organized to settle the question of the suitability of such meaxt for the purposes of human food. The appeance of aome of the meeat exposed for sale in certain of the poor distdict of the metropolis would seem to afford good grounds for believing that such meat is auything but wholesome food. Ibeg yoIr attention, Sir, to thin matter, which so deeplI
roncerns the poorer cluses direotly and all the rloh Indirectly. Urwholesome food is the parent of disease ; disese may grow into contagion, aud that, y lre death, comes a like tlo rch anaud poor, Pr eventi on, they say, is better tbhan oure -
us use every exertion, then, to nevent ono erat causso*hO Baeof unwholesome meat,,

ENCTUhIBERED ESTATIES' COURT TITXZS.
(ROM OUR OWN CODR E8POND WI'
DIUBLIN. TUESDAY MnR
lhe Judges, with the exception of Mlr. Justice Keogh, who was absent, sat in error yesterday for the purpose of giving judgment in the important case of " Errington v. Rorke," the decision upon which has been looked for with great anxiety by parties who have been, or mayhereafter be purchasers of land upon the faith of a Parliamentary title. The case came before their Lordships by 'writ of error from the Court of Queen's Bench, where theLord Chief Justice and Judge Mooreheld that an Encumbe-ed Estates' Court conveyance did not convey an indefeasible title when the Commissioners professed to convey the land of one party, which, in reality, was the property of another; Mr. Justice Crampton being of a different opinion, and holding that the conveyance did convey a title, even when there had been a mistake as to the owrnership or extent of land included in the conveyance.
It appeared that the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff below, and that the facts of the caee were these:-
" With reference to the lands in controversy, although there was a dispute as to the names, there was no dispute as to the boundaries, and it was alleged that nothing could be more precise than the description of the premises set out in the ejectment. The boundaries in the ejectment were stated to be I that part of the barony of Clonagh ranning as a strip along and adjoining the lands of Muckland,and which strip of landwasconveyedbydeedofthe29th ofJnly,1853,to theaintiffin error by the Encumbered EstatesConmnissioners.' There was, in faot, no dispute as to the precise lands, the subject. matter of the ejectinent, which contained 21a. 3r. 21p. The plaintiff rested his title to the lands upon the conveyance of 1853, and the map, which was subdivided in the bill of exceptons, showed that the portion of groundin controversy wlas incuded within its limits. The plaintiff having proved the title on the trial of the ejectment closed his case, and relied on his title as undeniable, by virtue of the conveyance from the Commissioners of the Encumbered Estates Court. It was a conceded fact upon both sides that the land, the subject-matter of the ejectment, had been the estate in fee of Frederick Hamilton; and it was also conceded that Mr. Hamilton was so largely indebted as to make it a proper proceeding to present a petition to the Encumbered Estates Court for the sale of his estates; and accordingly a sale was ordered, and the plaintiff in error became a purchaser to a considerable extent, including the land in question. The defendant reBed u n a title, of which be was the assignee, contained in a lease for three lives, or 31 years made by Mr. Hamilton, on the 19th of March, 1822, and therefore long anterior to the plaintiff's conveyance from the Encumbered Estates Court in 1853. The plaintiff in this ejectment, it also appeared, objected to tfie Chief Justicoe, before whom this action was tried, receiving the defendant's lease in evidence; and while it was not denied by the plaintiff that the lease of 1822 conveyed the piece of land in controversy to the defendant, the defendant, on the other hand, did not denythat the conveyance of theOCommissioners of 1853 included within itthe very same piece of laud. Other evidence was given at the trial by the defendant which was objected to, and the Chief Justice, in chargint the jury, left it to them to say whether the plaintiff purchased the preniisesin dispute as a reversion expectant on the determination of defendant's lease of 1822, as, if he did so, the conveyance of 1853 would only operate to pass the reversion. To this direction the plaintiff excepted, and upon these exceptions the case was argued. For the plaintiff m error, it was contended that the Encumbered Estates Court having power to sell this property, and having sold it and granted a conveyance, the title under that conveyance could not be controverted, while, on the other hand, it was insisted that under no circumstances could the commuissioners sell one man's propeHrt to pay the debts of another."
The judges differed in this case also, and pronounced their judgments separately.
The Court decided, by a large majority, that tbe decision of the Court of Queen's Bench should be overruled, and that a title granted by the Commissioners of the Encumbered Estates Court was indefeasible.
REDUCTION OF CUSTOMIS DUTIES.

The Public Health.
TED PUBLIQ RALTH.
(Prom the Registrar- Gveer*'s WeeldyRetumrn,)
In the week that ended on Saturday the total number of deaths registered in London ws I,235, of which 62b wera deaths of males, and 61 those ef females. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average number of deaths was 1,192, buat for comparison with the deaths of last week, which occurred in an increased population, the average must be raised proportionally to the increase, in which case it will become 1,31L The deaths now returned are therefore less by 76 than would have occurred if the average rate of mortalityv had prevailed.
The deaths from pulmonary diseases, which in the two previous weeks were 292 and 278, were last week 264, the corrected average for the 10 weeks corresponding with la$t week being 273. Bronchitis, one of the diseases in this clbs. was fatal in the last three weeks in 161, 160, and 130 cases, showing a decline with the higher and steadier temperature of last week. Whooping-cough numbered 64 cases, which differs little fronthe numbers returned in many provious weeks. Smallpox; scarlatnas and diarrhea ,xhibit,a low mortality, the deaths from them being respectively 2, 12, and 7. Eight parsons had attained the age of 90 years or upwards; they were all women except one; the three oldest died at the age of 93years. A youngseani died in the Dreadnought Hospital ship of v scorbutus, abe ess, and tetanus ;" and a labourer, aged 71 years, died at 30, Duke. street, Old Artillery Ground, of "neglect, filth, and imperfect nutrition.i
Last week the births of 936 boys and 902 girls, in all 1,838 children, were registered in Loidon. In the ten-corrcsponding weoks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,555.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mnean height of the barometer in the week was 29-334 in. The mean temperature was 47-8 deg., which is 4 2 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 yeas The mean temperature was above the average on every day. The thermometer in the shade rose to 584 deg. on Friday, the highest point in the week; the lowest temperature was 40-1 deg. on Wednesday. The mean dew-point temperature was 42-7 deg., and the differenoebetween this and the mean air-temperature was 51 deg. The general direction of thewind was southeast. There was more or lesa rain on every day; and the whole amount in the week wa 0-45 in.
In the first quarter of the year-namely, the 13 weeks that ended on March 28th, the deaths in London were 16,093, which exceed the deaths of the same quater in 1856, but are less than those of 1855. The increase on last year arises from pulmonary diseases-bronchitis,'pnenniomia, and phthisls - for though the mean temperature was nearly 39 deg., which is about the average of the winter quarter, and the mean weeldy temperature was on nine weeks above the average, the fifth and sixthweekswere very cold; and on two days at that time the thermometer fellto-20 deg. But though there is an excess in last quarter as comnared with the same quarter of 1856 in the total number of deafth there is a decrease in those arising from zymotic diwosces and it is remarkable that the deaths from this class of complaints *(2,713) were less than in any of the four previous corre-
sponding quarters of 18I-56, though the population has increased. The deaths from small-pox were 60, being little more than four in a week. There 2s a marked decrease also in typhus, which numbered489, having inthe same quarters of 1B53-56 ranged from 572 to 719.

AaiRicuvTURE IM PoP ' TrON IN F" OE*.-
An interesting article by LXLIonce de Lavergne has appeared under this title in the RBevu des Deezx Monies. After alluding to the fact already knowun through the last cencus,-viz.. that the increase of population in France during the last fivo years has proved very low, not exceeding 256,000 soul., while the census of 1846 gave an inorease of 1,170,000 souls, the author proceeds to examine whether this diminution should be considered a calamity or not. If the distress of the people proceeds from excess of population-if a slower increase Is accompanied by an improvement in their condition, it should be considered a boon. hL de Lavergne here enters into a defence of the Malthusian dcrtrine, and proceeds to apply it to the case of France sincoe 1790, when its population consisted of 28,500,000 soul. Twenty-five yers later it had increased by 3,000,090; inthe comuse of 30 years more (1846) there was an additional ian crease of 6,000,000; aud during the last 10 years the increa-e has been under 600,000. Hence, during the revolutionary and imperial period the annual average 'of increase was 120,000; during the Restoration and Monarchy of July, 200000- and since then, 60,000. Now, according to Mi;thu;, the amount of population doubles in the cburse of 25 years, unless checked by scarcity of food; and this check, the author contends, has operatd in France, at the same time producing a greater amount of individual comfort. From 1790 to 1846 the produce of agriculture has doubled; had the population increased in the same proportion-viz. to 53,000,000, the amount of means of subsistene per head would have remained the same; but the population having increased in a lower ratio there has 'Peen a corre8ponding increase in the average of individual comfort. Thus, if in 1790 theremhthave been distributed lOOf. par head, the average distribution in 1846 would have been150f. If theproduction of nanufactare be added to that of agriculture, and be vaued at 50f. per head in 1790 and 150f, in 1846, the average of individual comfort will be found to have doubled, this, according to the author, is really the case. dnd if the average duration of life, which Malthus considers to be the true measure of national prosperity, be taken into account, it will be found that iun rance this average has risen from 28 years to 39. The latter point was attained just before 1847, when France was increasing her population at the rate of 200,000 souls per anuum, and every three years adding one year to the mean duration of life. The most prosperous period of agriculture in France also falls within the 30 years preceding .1847, when the mean increase of production was 2 per cent. annually, and might have risen to 5 and even 10 per cent. without becoming extraordinary. The scarcity of 1847 and the subsequent revolution of 1848 changed all this; the excess of births over deaths fell from 237,000 to 62,000 in 1847, and to 13,000 in 1849, when the cholera raged; mean duration of life stationary. Things grow worse after 1851 under the double influence of scarcity and war. In 1854 and 1855 the deaths for the first time exceeded the births. It is curious to trace the effects of political events upon the progress of population. The anxiet7 created in 1848 in. creased the number of deaths and diminished the number of births, a circumstance which finds its parallel in 1830-32.
_fter 1850 public confidence bepax to revive, the excess of birtbs over deaths suddeuly rose 1n that year from 13 000 to 187,000; it fell to 112,000 in 1851, and iose again to 144,000 the following year. This movement was stopped by four succeesive bad harvests, to which must be added the grapeblight and the disease of the silk-worm ; the aggregate of the losses accruing from all these causes the author states at nearly 2,000,0uf. in four years. At the same time tho production of cattle decreased, and terrible epidemics carried off sheep by flocks; meanwhile, in consequence of bad forage, the quality of the larger species of cattle has deterorated, and in order to maintain the usual supply-of meat a larger number has to be kiled. To all these eiroumnstances the author now adds the effects of the war, which are sufficiently evident, and the increase of la
to elucidate which he first points to the fact, brought to light by the census of 1856, of the immigration of the rural population to the towns and the consequent depopulation of 54 departments. He admits the right of the labourer and workman to seek higher salaries where they can find them, and shows that such a tendency, when operating gradually, is far from being hurtful in its consequences. There was a time when the country was over. peopled and manufacturing towns were in want of hands; the excess of the former then naturally flowed in to relieve the requirement of the latter, and the balance was gradually restored. But at present this transformation has assumed the character of a violent perturbation; agriculture has lost an immense number of hands, while manufacture has not been supplied with them in an equal proportion, since its produchon does not show any sudden increase. The rise in the price of raw materials has, on the contrary, impeded the progress of many manufactures; and as regards railways France is rather behindhand with other nations than otherwi^ v The -thsor now points to the danger of the sudden agg,omeration of 300,000 new inhabitants in the capiial. In the case of London such an agglomeration is free from danger, because it has been effected gradually, without the influence of over-exciting causesbut in Paris the case is different. From an officil
decument it ap pears thet out of 2,379,000,0001. paid by the treasury in 1855 the department of the Seine has alone absorbed 877,000,000, while in 1850 its sharewas497,000,000. This concentration of the pubhoi money in Paris has created an extravagant degree of luxury, which the author considers to be fraught with great danger for the fature. The increasing dearness of all the necessaries of life shows that the improvement of its comforts which the rural population seeks in coming to Paris is illusory, because it Is coupled with a diminution of production. It is true that in consequence of the immense increase of consumption in Paris there has been a corresponding increase in agrisultural produce within a radius of 50 learues around the capital, but the other parts of France, especially the eastern and south-western departments, have suffered in proportion, the harvest havinzg there been one-fourth, and in some instances one-half, below the average. The author shows that all these effects are peculiar to France, and have not manifested themselves in other countries, although the last harvests have been generally bad all over Europe. He then proceeds to grapple with a difficulty which tells against his argument,--viz., that the kroduce of the indirect taxes has considerably increased. This he explains, first, by obsering that a large portion of this increase is a result of new taxes laid on, and, secondly, by taling into account the extraordinary expenses of the war, the universal exhibitions, and the great publio works. What he finds himself unable to explain ia the immense increase in the consmption of tobacco -positively 200,000,OOOf. annually turned into smoke-ind at length attributes it to an increased tendency to idleness evinced by the population. IL de IATergne now points out the remedies for such a state of things. The Government, he thinks, is too much in the habit of aiding private enterprise by grants of public money, the consequenoe of which is that no one undertakes anything important without a subsidy frori the State. 'This should not be; private energy would be better caled into action by leaving it to its own resources. Let the publio expenses, which during the last three yeas have exceeded -2,0,OOO,OOO,f. per annum, be again reduced to their forner amount of 1,500,0000.- let all ueless public works be suspendd, new loans be avotaed the establialmient of new nlstittiohs of eredit ana all artificial excitements to luy be diwouraged, the expenees of the military establsUntbe reduced to the strictet limits, and then, the author concludes let FIrane Wit patietly for tue ffect oftthee resorative mbemre

seco=d daughter of the late General James Murray. 'The deceased was in holy orders, -but subsequently to' his a'ession to the family estates he lived priAcipally either at Douglas Castle or at Bothwell Castle, andrarely took any ative part in publio affairs. He was al3o very seldom seen in the House of Lords. Dyins childless, he is succeeded ia his estates-which are principally situated ia Clyd4sdale, ancd estimated tobe worth about 55,0001. per anaum-by hus sister, Lady Elizabeth, married in 1832 to the Earl of .Home. This lady is the mother of a large family,, the eldest
of whom is Lord Douglas.
The deceased peer was the son of the first Baron Douglas, in whose name " The Great Douglas Cause"-the most important legal case of the last century-was carried' on. In conmexion with the death of the last male heir, itmay not oe out of place to give a brief, sketch of.this celebxted case. The Duke of Douglas died childless in 1761, when the title became extinct, but the real and personal estate was claimed by his nephew, Mr. Archibald Stewart, who *5a served nearest heir to the Duke ia the same year. The assumption of the estates led to this memorable lawsuit. Lady Jane Douglas, siter to theLlast-Duke alreadly mentioned, ws one of the'handsome6t women'of her time, ind in August, 1746, being then 48 years of age,- she was secretly maried to hfr. Stewart, afterwards Sir' John Stewart, of Graudtully. They esidedd broad, principally in Rrace, from 1746 till the end of December, 1749. At the latter date they returned to this. country aiid took up their residence in London, bringing with then two male children, of whom they gAve out that Iady Jane had been delivered in Paris at a twin birth in July, 1748. The youngest of the twins, who was'named Sholto Thomas Stewart, died in May, 1753, anid in November of the'stne year Lady Jane died at Edinburgh. Immediately after She Duke's death the guardians of the surviving youth proceeded to- Vut hia in posression of the estates of the Douglis family. He was served heir to the late Duke before a jury after the examination of a great body of evidence, the examination or inquest having been attended by counsel on the part of tne Dake of Hamilton, who claimed the Douglas estate as heir inale. The guardians of the Dake of Hamilton 'were not convinced, however, of the legitimacy of Stewart .or Douglas, and with the view of clearmng up thecase they sent agents to the continent, 'who bought back a great body of evidence to prove that the pretended delivery of Lady Jane was a fiction, and that the twins' really belonged to two poor families in France, named respectively Migmon and Saury. The gnardians of Mr.Stewart, on the other hand, brought forward persons to swear that they hbad seen Lady Jane in a xrate of pregnancy, and that they were actually present. at thebit...teseetwins. Af ter.evidence had be=en collected pro and con, fromnevery quarter, andnioet minutely sifted and criticized, the case cate on for ;nd'gtiuent in the Court of Sessdon in Scotland on the 7th of July. 1767, and so important was the' cause deemed that the 15 Judges took eight days to deliver their opinions. The resnlt was that seven of thejudgesivoted in favour of the identity or legitimacy of Mr. 8tewart and seven against it; the Lord President, who had the casting vote, agreed with the latter, by which Douglas, alias Stewart, -was cast on the world without either name or estate. An appeal from this decision was taken to the liouse of Lords, however, by whioh the judg'ent of the Court of Session was reversed in 1769' and' Archibald Stewart, or Douglas, declared tobe the uidobted son of Lady Jane, the sister of the late Dke.

Sir,-I have received the following extract of a letter, dated Konigsberg, April 2, which will be read with interest at this time, as it estblishes the value of precautionary measures. The writer of the letter also gines his opinion. There is much unnecessary alarm in England, but it does not apper there was less need of it in Prassia a year ago than exists nowas regarde England. He says,
. The cattle diweaa3 in Russla ba not shown itself to any extent on our xide of the frontier, and only a few vilaes near Tauroggen and Georgenbuirg (close to the frontier) have xnifered by it. With tho excepeon of seengers nothing is allowed to rans the frontier lnto Pedlai un the affected localitle2, and it i no doubt owing to these Vre cautionary measures that we have escaped so far, sad that, in fact, we have been entirely free from it durlngtbe Winter."

RECOGNIZING THE DEAD.-Among the most har-
RECOGNIZENG THE DEAD.-Among the moat hare rowing scenes attending this fearful catastrophe (the aodc dent on the Great Western R%ilway of Canada) is the wit. nessing of the unhappy relatives recognizing the mangled remains of husbands, fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters. Yesterday morning the wife of Mr. Morley arrived from St. Catherine's to pick out of the many dead his bodl. The scene was heartrending as she passed from one dead body to another, all marking death with greater horrors by beinE more or less mangled. At last one even more distorted and m-angled than the rest was come to, and a wild scream but too well told her tale of woe; and in a large storehouse, strewn with dead bodies, and with others going the rounds to make similar heartrending discoveries, was she left to kneel down and bewail her bereavemelit. While on one side of the large building a row of bodies was placed, as yet unrecognzed, and questions were asked of everynewcomer if he or she knew anything of them, a sob or a moan wrould bo heard in another part, indicating that some one had come from a distance and found all her sad expecations realized. Nor was the circumstance less harrowing of passing the stranger by who, far from his home, and far from those who were dreaming of his retur, lay there a mangled, mnrecognized, unwept victim of a raiirad disabter. Here was evidently a poor Irish labourer; his pine was still in his band, and a smile played over his kindly countenance. One passed, yet another, and stillanother, and no one knew him. God only knew the grlef that soie would feel who did know him. Here again linger a larger

TO THE BDITOR OF THE TI,MS.
Sir,-Permit me to draw your attention to an error in The Times of yesterday. Among all the University scholars,hips gained by Ruebeuans you mention " the, Mathematical Scholarship. The scholarship to which Mr. Davey lIa been elected is " tho Johnson.' The Senior Mathematical Seholarehip, to which alone, if to any, belongs so exclusive a designation as "the" Mthematical Scholarship, was on Thursday last awarded to Mr. G. P. Bell, who was not brought up at Rugby School.

The National Collections.-A return was
Tan sAnoNAL COLLCIoxS.-A return was moved for in the last Paliment by. r. W Eart. ehowing how far, in the different collections af works
of art, objects of historical interest or science, the rule ! has been observed of attaching to the objects of art a
brief account of them. It appears that in the British Museum the large Egyptian sculptures have generally their names attached, and that they wil all have them soon. !The Asyrian sculptures and the Greek and Roman sculp-
tures have descriptive inscriptions or labols attached to them, and the objects of curiosity in the other departments appfar to be generally labelled and inscribed. The labels for the bronzes axe but few at present, and the enamels and ivones are partially labelled. Owing to the over-crowded
tr tl n t X<ootob U-atvr4 "7i-o a- w proportion of the speoimens would be hidden by a greater nuamber of labeIs and thus the unity and appearance oa the collection would be overpowered and destroyed. In Eanmton Court Palaco there are some labels, but these give only imperfect information; and 204 pictures are wholly vithout description. The number of visitors last year was 361,752, and the number of catalogues sold 12,418 In Rew-gardens the living plants, which number about 15,000 specimens and varieties, are all named in a oonspicuous and rather expensive manner on iron, tin, or wood labels. The remaining one-third, or less, are written on blac or wooden tllies, and generaly attached to young or recently reoeivedplants, which will in time bear the liagW and more cosUy abels. A number of duplicates in the gardens are unnamed. In the Musenu of Economic Botany almost al the specimens are labeled with both the common and the botanical names. The nutmber of visitors to the gardens and museum of Kew last year ws 344,140, whi& is an increae of 16,150 on the year of the Grand Exhibition in !de-park. 2,432 catalogues were sold. In the Na-
oal Glery descriptions, as requied,- have been Attached to all the pictures-viz., xubject, master his birth and death, and the date and school of the pictIre.
the Museum of Art at Marlborough-house the rule of appending a label to every work of art has been acted on from its commencement in 1852 as fully am the varyi arrngement of the collection would admit, The plan thea the ouse of Commons is desirous 'to see adpted. 4n all the publEc =um ineiteakngdom, inoraeitoe - Toy to the visitors the greatest amount of unlInowlsdgo and to save the expense of a Catalogue, is the one earied out in the Museum of Irih Ind", whe fuly deecip. tive libels are attacebd to each specnimiA.

London, Wednesday, April 8, 1857.
LONDON, WEDNESDAY, APBIL 8, 1857.
It is the lot of our restless, adventurous, and high-spirited community that the Temple of JiAus should be seldom closed. The country has within the last few days ratified the policy of the Minister, troops are ready for embarcation, and gunboats are being fitted out with all despatch. The war with China has begun, and, in default of Eubmission from the Celestial authorities, will be energeticaUy prosecuted. But it is satisfactory to learn that, coincident with these proceedings, the curtain has fallen on the last act of the Turkish war. The British fleet has just left the Bosphorus and DardaneUes, the Austrians are out of the Principalities, the Russians have evacuated Ismnail and abandoned the mouths of the Danube. The last vestige of the great contest has passed away. Lord LyoNs in his flagship at Malta, the Russian (Generals on their own side of the newly-traced frontier, the Austrians from their commanding position on the north-west, must now content themselves with watching at a distance the affairs of the coun'ry with which they are forbidden to interfere. Thus has been solved, as far as man can solve it, the Eastern question. Never has a passage in the world's history possessed more unity and completeness. Never has a great enterprise been more suddenly resolved on, more enthusiasticaUy conducted, and more speedily and siiecessfully concluded. The war between the Western Powers and Russia resembled more some fabulous expedition of antique heroes or mei-eval knights than the sober plans of a modern Cabinet, carried out by ordinary military men. It was in spirit as woll as in cause a Crusade. Wars have been, ever since the elaboration of the military art two ceturies ago, especially cautious in character and long in duration. The wonderful exploits of NAXoSow scarcely form an exception, for his whole career may in one sense be considered as a prolonged struggle with Europe. But, as a general rule, history presents in modern times a series of wars undertaken for selfish purposes of dynasty, or trade, or territorial extension, and carried on with much of formality and science, and with many alternations of success, until all parties, worn out with exertion, and careless of the objects for wbich they commenced hostilities, acquiesce in a treaty which gives a decided triumph to none. The wars of two centuries between ourselves and the French are instances in point. Who could have thought four years ago that Europe, which then heard so much about universal peace, was about to plunge into a war more adventurous, perhaps, than any known for ages, and carry it in an incredibly short space of time to a glorious conclusion ? It is sometimes difficult to recall one's exact frame of mind at any past period ; but if four years since any one had talked of checking Russian aggression by war, we should certainly have figured to ourselves a far different, a far longer, and more exhausting struggle. In the first place, xnost people would have denied the political possibility of such, a war, as the Czar Nxcnox.As himself denied it. It is all very well, they would say, to talk of oppressed nationalities or threatened empires, of the closing of a river or the danger of a capital; but distant Powers will not go to war for a mere principle, nor break up the system of Europe to dispel the nightmare which its on a few alarmists. But, suppose France and England combined, how are they to attack their enemy?
Are they to-renew the attempt- of 1812? What would old Generals, and military historians, and Commiariat officers, and officers of trains and equipages, say to such a scheme? Are they, on the other hand, to goto Turkey, and, then crossing the Danube, to attack the Russians in the Principalitiea ? What an adventurous attempt,-to land in an uncultivated country, without roads or canals, perhaps destitute of needful supplies to be forced to carry everything necessary for a campaign across the sea ; to be without a base of operations, to paus a wide river, and to attack a strongly posted army in a territory with which the enemy's Generals are perfectly acquainted, where they have the sympathy of the inhabitants, and where they dispose as masters of all the resources of the country I
Yet, in spite of precedent, and in disregard of military science, war was declared, and the result has been whatwehave seen. The courage andhonesty of the two nations found. a path to success which the forethought of no statesman or general could have discovered. We can well believe that neither England nor France, when their troops first landed in the East, had any very clear conceptions of a campaign. They were disposed to believe in the power of the Russian Generals to march on the Turkiah capital, and hence the scheme for fortifying Constantinople, which is now almost forgotten. As we drifted into war, so we drifted into each successive military enterprise. But the lesson to be deduced is all the more gratifying. It is, that courage, promptness, and confidence in a good cause are prett;y sure to win the day. We may not have had any master mind in either army, we may have done much that future historians will have a difficulty in explaining, since it was purposeless and unmeaning, but, from the enthusiasm of the people at home and the spirit of our officers abroad, there was no lack of boldness in all that was done-a boldness which disconcerted the enemy, who had reckoned on more legitimate and cautious warfare. The movement towards the Danube, the invasion of the Crimea, the foray into the Sea of Azoff, the defence of Kars, were al instances of happy audacity whicb, though forming part of no great plan, and indicating the presence of no one pre-eminent mind, have been fuUy successful, and have brought to a conclusion the most hazardous enterprise of modern times. Nothing but boldness could have been successful, and, in wnatever qualities the nation and its officers may have been deficient, thev certainly never failed to carry on hostilities with the highest spirit and confidence in themselves.
So far as England is concerned, the complete and speedy success obtained is, we think, owing to that very popular interest and interference of which the army was at the time so impatient. It was not as gladiators in the arena or boxers in the prize-ring that the British army was watched by the British people; but as the combatants in a contest in which the nation felt that victory must come speedily if it was to come at all. Hence the anger felt at each delay and miscarriage, the joy displayed at each success. The country forced on events; never were troops more quickly gathered, battles more frequently fought, or a greater quantity of campaigning compressed into a small space of time. We began the war as we began the Ameriean war, or the war against the French Convention-in a state of unpreparedness. But times are altered in one respect. Then the popular voice was weak, and the consequence was that reforms were slow and uncertain. As our armies were in 1774 so they were in 1783; as they were when the Duke of YORx went to Holland so they were for years and years, until WmixoTo2o took them in hand. But at the present time a few weeks of popular indignation were sufficient to bring about a sudden reform, which within six months restored the army to efficiency and the country to its place in Europe.
It was only a popular war, a war of enthusiasm, almost of fanaticism, which could have produced such results in so short a termn. Only four years ago the Secretary of Embassy at Constantinople sent to the Admiral commanding our Mediterranean fleet a request that he would make his appearance in the Turkish waters. The authority of the SULTN, the independence, the very existence of his Empire were threatened. The long-cherished schemes of the Russian Monarchs were, in the opinion of millions, about to be fulfilled. People told of ancient prophecies concerning the conquest of Constantinople and the extinction of the Mussulman Power. Not only Turkish fatalism and Greek ambition listened to these legends, but even the educated, enlightened political West practically acknowledged them. It was the manifest destiny of Russia to have Constantinople one day. They were a conquering people, the Turks were a decaying people; why should we fight against fate ? In short, Europe through its length and breadth was under the Russian spell. How deep was that influence, how rooted that conviction of Mluscovite power, we mnay learn by recalling the number and the eminence of the men of all nations who up to the very close of the war doubted the ultimate triumph of the Allies. Yet within foar years of the time when the first anchor was cast in Besica Bay the last line-ofbattle ship ha,s steamed down the Dardanelles, and the last foreign soldier has quitted Turkish soil. In that time the destinies, the aims, and the political faith of Europe have been changed. Seldom has so short a period witnessed so great a revolution. A gloomy phase in the world's history has passed away.
We shall be believed when we say that we
We shall be believed when we say that we would rather never have to make a remark on en Episcopal appointment. It is a point on which we are entirely of a mind with Premiers, -who notoriously consider it an act of hostility for a Bishop to die in their time. They would rather that a Bishop never died, or that the clergy cast .ots, as they used to do, or that the office was gratuitous, if not penal, or that it went from father to son, or that, any how, they had not to make an appointment which none bat foolish women desire to make, none but worldly men desire to have, which is above human sagacity, and, as often as not, disappoints the patron. There are kinds of patronage in -which a man may h&ve the pleasure of rewarding a friend; but a Premier has almost invariably to go out of his circle, often out of his class, and sometimes even out of his opinions, in quest of somebody whom he never saw before, and will seldom see again. Premiers have served friends, and lamented the necessity of doing it in so sacred an affair. We believe that appointments are very rarely made witlout anxious thought, and for that reason alone they are entitled to respect. There is, however, a mode of exercising the patronage which seems, to a certain extent, an abnegation of its responsibility. When it is understood that the Prermier puts his conscience on this point in another's keeping, as the nation certainly loses the direct exercise of his practised judgment, his high intelligence, and his ideal of official aptitude, thera will be less disposition to spare him if he does not satisfy all round. Lord PArsxsTow will not be surprised if the nomination of the Hon. and Rev. J. T. PzurEr to the Bishopric of Norwich is rather sharply criticized. Coming immediately after the elevation of BAlixG, M. Vamx tsj and BIcxnSmrm, and ascribed, with theirs, to the influenoe of Lord SnAxBursYn, it will be disengaged, as
Lord PALmTo n; himwelf would seem to wish it, from the rest of his administration, and taken on its own merits. It miust tax, almost beyond bearing, the patience ofa large part of the Church of England, and scarcemly allows us, if we wished ever so 3nuch, to pass it over Without remark. We cannot deny the provocation to conItroversy given by the appointment of four
strong adherents of the Evangelical partyall excellent men, popular men, preachers to the people, and accepted by the people, and with other good qualities, yet not men of much learning or genius, and apparently selected because, eceterispariins, they are members of a party, 2nd have their names down, not only in the Book of Life, but also in the Peerage.
The whole subject is so beset with difficultiesthere is so much to be said for any way of getting -out of them, and especially for going by the personal recommendations considered in these four instances, that we really don't profess to have any bill of indictment ready against the Premier. -We are only too content not to be in the scrape -ourselves to think of competing with Lord SHA. sBtmY for the directorahip of Lord PAumEasTO_'S ecclesiastical conscience. The effects of any given appointment are beyond calculation. No matter who or what the man is, the probability is he never preaches a good sermon again, as this is one of the gifts which is evidently -ather taken away than imparted by consecration. There are exceptions, but they are very rare -indeed, and a.preacher'swarmest admirers are sure to observe the rapid extinction of his eloquence .under the cares of office. There must be something in tae thick stuff of the modern cassock and the tumid lawn sleeves, for Bishops were once preachers. Then Bishops taken in the dedine of life, as often as not, resign themselves into the hands of their doctors and nurses, and are seldom heard of again except as the victims of painful disorders and manifold infirmities. Lord PAtsExSTow, however, is giving us young Bishops. But there is another 'danger in youth, or rather a certain phase, which young Bishops are sure to go through. They start with the idea, prevalent in nurseries and round ladies' worktables, that Bishops can " do " things; that they can make laws, reform abuses, set things right, malke 'the clergy do their duty, and so forth. Now, a Bishop is a prominent personagegenerally himself a picked man, with some qualities above the common run; he has rather a better income than the rest of the clergy; he lives in a better house, he has " a handle "to his name," he is in request for occasional sermons and for dinner parties, and he has the giving away of a living, sometimes a good one, once or twice in a twelvemonth. We had almost forgotten that he sits in the House of Lords, which is no great addition either to the cares or to the dignities of his office. All these things contribute to give the Bishop much influence,-about as much, perhaps, in his own proportion and kind as IHn MAJESTY has in hers. But a Bishop-that is, a young one-commonly spends the first five years of his reign in slowlydiscovering that he can do nothing but what any other influential man can do ; that he can only refer his clergy to the Prayer-book, to the Canons, and to Acts of Parliament; and that even with regard to the enforcement of law and discipline his position is only that of-public prosecutor, and even in that capacity he can only act at the cost of thousands of pounds. No sooner does a Bishop venture to apply his own ideas of propriety to a question than he finds it taken into Doctors'commons, and measured with the ideas of other men. In fact, Episcopacy is, and in the historical ages of the Church always has been, a purely ministerial office. No doubt that is all it ought to be, and it would become a most abominable tyranny if it were more. Young Bishops, however, are slow to discover this, and when they have discovered it take some time to recover the equanimity lost in the process. Then Bishops, of all schools, are apt to settle into certain types that signify but little one way or another for polemical purposes. Some are pre-eminently domestic characters, and devote themselves to their sons or daughters; some lay up money; some get into hot water, and publish quarrelsome pamphlets; some write books, and even preach sermons, about everything but the Articles of the Christian faith; some, as we have intimated, are, and continue to be, confirmed invalids. Now, none of these can answer any particular purpose that a highminded statesman can be supposed to have in making them Bishops, and can have but little effect on the Church, for good or for evil. But the great predominance of such cases shows how little men need fret about the selection of Bishops from one school or from another. It is so much the saen thing in the end.
What, however, is most insisted upon is the presumed effect of the PRETnER'S choice, in the way of encouragement and discouragement, and the general character of hopefulness, or the contrary, which he nuay help to give to any party in the Church. Experience largely qualifes any estimnate of these effects. The spirit of contradiction, strong everywhere, is eajecially so in the British bosom; and Christians of all Churches and ages have loved to be persecuted. High Church Bis-hops and dignitaries abounded in the generation closed by the Reform Bill, and the result :was the formation of the Evangelical party. Since that, it has only been by accident that here and there, under a disguise, a High Churceman has been madeBishop, Dean, Canon, or even an Archdeacon. The result is that the High Church party never was so numerous, wealthy, fashionable, and enthusiastic as it is at this day; and for every " Evangelicar' Bishop Lord clSAFESBURY can make there enter the Church twenty curates strongin the Fathers, churchbuilding, vestments, seasons, and services. When a man enters the Church for a hundred a-year, and E6nds, after working or idling for ten years, that he will never get a farthing more, it makes no difference to him, except that it may make him more obstinate, that his " opinions" preclude him from a Bishopric. Nor has an appointment always the best effect even on the party of the favoured
object. On a recent occasion a good many clergy of the new Bishop's own school thought themselves quite as well qualified as he was, and lost some of their faith, not, of course, in the principles that had led to his promotion, but in the judgment which selected him for the best example of them.
But there is one rule of common sense which is certainly violated by a rapid s-accession of appointments of one remarkable character. It is both offensive to the taste and against the rules of prudence to run on too much in one strain, and to give people too much even of a good thing. It is risking too much in one bottom. What if one Evangelical patrician Bishop out of a dozen should commit some characteristic folly ? It would touch the whole class. Many a Bishop is already thought "reserved" and "exclusive" by the five hundred clergymen whom he does not admit into his private confidence and ask to dine at his palace whenever their occasions call them up to the cathedral town; butwhenthe Bishop is not only aRight Reverend, but also an Honourable, or at least the nephew of a Peer, the clergy will have stil less difficulty in accounlting for their absence from the Episcopal tables. But, seriously, there are certain peculiar influenced inevitable to certain conditions end circumstaiices; and if there is not a little more variety in our Bishops the Church will suffer, as a maan does by living too much on one food or breathing t-y$ much one mir, as & race doos by breeding
in and in, and asi crop do"- by being repeated over and over again on the sune acre of ground. For our part, we have no great faith in Lexicon and Greek-play Bishops, or in coutrovergial Bishops, or in entomological Bishops, or mero
Episcopal pedagogues, oi metaphysioa Bishops, I or, in fact, Bishops of any one kind; but for that very reson we should thini it safer to mix them. It would never do for the -hole Bench to be unable to construo a verse in the Greek Testament, or even to refer to the inferior clergy for the history of Sr. AM13BROS or ST. .AmUASIUS. Then, what if all the Bishops were members of the City Mision, and were sending Dissenting mionaries to *ummon the Rocks of the London clergy to the Gospel, wherever it was preached, while the clergy themselves stood more stiffly than ever upon Prayerbook, Articles, and Canons? Considering the many various elements combined in the constitution of our Church, there ought, for peace sake, to be a corresponding variety in its ministers. There is only one excuse which would justify a Minister in a perfectly uniform and one-sided selection; and that is the probability of a short tern of offlce. In that case he would naturally make the most of it; reasoning that, as others would do the same, he was only doing his part towards the equilibrium. But that need not be Iord P5A-xRSTON'S excuse, nor ought he to proceed on the calculation of a brief career. The -basis of his Administration is broad and comprehensive. So, also, ought his policy to be in all its applications. No doubt it will be, as far as he personally directs; the danger is when he delegates his power to men of narrower sympathies and less extended vision.
PALEY opens his great work by supposing the
PAIEY opens his great work by SuppoEing the case of a kind of Man FBRIAY who, in the course of one of his savage strolls, strikes his foot against a watch, picks it up, submits it to examination, and finally discovers in it such an adaptation of means to ends that he is irresistibly driven to the conclusion that such results could not have been obtained without an intelligent M3mm. Now, if one were to write a serious dissertation upon that wonderful piece of machinery which is called the Electoral System in these islands, he would be driven to suppose a case well nigh diametricaUythe opposite of the one put by FAnzy. The end is produced-the bull's-eye is'hit in a most fair and unmistakeable manner. Under this system, such as it is-ay, and under the far more faulty and abnormal Vstem which it has replaced-a measure of liberty has been attained by Englishmen the like of which has never been known in any society of human beings since the days of historical record began. There exists, we say, in the British Islands greater liberty of act, speech, and thought than on any other portion of the earth's surface, not even excepting the territory of the North American Confederation. But when centuries have passed away, and some future philosopher of retiriug habits-say Mr. Mc&AuLAY's New Zealander-ripe with learning of aU kinds, and rich with the experience of the next two thousand years, sball in a moment of black-letter enthusiasm seriously set to work upon the British Electoral System as an illustration of popular governmentof liberty obtained by an even and regular representation of the people, his soul will be sorely disquieted within him, and his spirit be vexed vith many doubts. As, in the year 3857, he calmly considers the subject in his retirement at WorriWorroo, he wil first find that out of a population of 28,000,000 this popular government was in the hands of precisely 1,206,539. It might, however, be that this million and odd of privileged individuals did really shadow forth the country,-that they were representative men, who, in their turn, chose representatives. He might, indeed, be surprised to fimd that a little mignionette-pot of a place called Wycombe, in a county caUed Bucks, with 346 registered electors, returned two representative men to the British Parliament, while another place caUed Liverpool, in a county called Lancashire, with 17,433 registered electors, did exactly the same; that Woodatock, with 34T electors, returned one member, and Salford, with 2,950 electors, counted in Parliament for no more than a single vote. Many other such anomalies he would find which he would be totally unable to explain, but which we,who live in the midst of the machinery, can explain well enough. We know that under this strictly Mogical system we arrive at certain results, and that there is a rough kind of fai-ness-with, no doubt, a considerable amount of abuse-in arrangements which appear at first sight to violate all propriety. Would our New Zealand critic and friend appreciate, for example, one of the chief objects at which the contrivers of o-ir Electoral System have aimed-namely, the partition of the representation between the rural and urban population, so that the counties and the towns respectively might have their dne share of influence ? We do not say that the result has in strictness been obtained, or that improvements are not desirable, but at least suchis the idea that runs through the scheme. The effort has been to keep the county and town populations apart; we know but of one instance in which the rule has been very flagrantly violated, and the instance is that of the metropolitan county, Middlesex, which has just effected its return.
A portion of the connty of Middlesex is purely and exclusively agriculturaL The Cockneys, sua si bonta n6iint, might discover endless little nooks and forgotten corners in their own county, than which there is nothing more solitary in Cumberlard, nothing more rural in Somerset or Devon. On the other hand, the surface of the county is dotted over withl great towns, and on its southern fringe stands Babylon the Great. Is it credible that a large portion of London is, for electoral purposes, considered to be part of this bucolic county? The black reeking chimneys of the metropolitan suburbs are lumped in with the buttercup meadows,' of Hendon and the pleasant hills that lead away from Edgeware. What community of interest can there be between the tradesman who carries on his retail business in Sloane-street and the farmer who lives by Uxbridge ? If fusion, not partition, of the urban and rural populations is to be the rule, let us have a portion of Sutherlandshire incorporated with London "for the pur"C poses of this Act." Let Liverpool and Manchester return thie members for Lancashire, and let Glasgow send Lanarkshire's representative to the House of Commons. If, indeed, the representation were to be remodelled upon that principle, -which has not been without its advocates-namely, the system of electoral districts, thero would be nothing to be said against the anomaly. When the trigonometrical and surveying gentlemen had done their work it would not afford matter for surprise that the acute angle of a town had been thrust out into a rural county, or that the section of a marine population had been dovetailed into aI manufacturing district. When -we find that the system is received semper, ubiue, et ab ornoibu.s there will be the less to say; but while the metropolitan county continues to be well nigh the solitary, as it surely is the most important exception to 'the usual rule, wee shalt never cease to urge bpon our legislators the propriety of reforming the anomnaly. One consequenceof the present arrangement is, that the, majority of all the electors and the vast majority of the rural electors are bso-n lutely imdifferent to their votes. Arustic ir.,>idlese:s k. to all intents and putpowW di*cA0iU.
The constituency conss-tof uomethivg.ikt 10,090 electors, and the inajQyity of these is a towu majority. Why sbould thermer be at the pains of going to some ditsant polling-plsce for the 4k. of just throwing his vote away? Not one-half ot the constituency polled at the recent election. We doubt, indeed, if 7,000 elecro i.n nAl recorded their rotes for all the candidates, when due allowances are made for split votes. Nor is the .dainess confined to the case of the farmers. The electoral inhabitants of Chelies and Kensington are nearly as completely swamped by the rough democracy of Mile-end as are the outlying Middlesex agricuturists. There i5, indeed, nearly as little communit4 of feeling between MKile-enir and Kensington as between Mile-end and Edgewrare.
The remedy would seem to be an obvious onewe mrast hAve more metropolitan boroughb. InConvenient as the proposition may seem to the rosewater school, the metropolis, as well as eve,* other portion of the empire, must be fairly reprorented. It is a blot on our Electoral System that the wealth and intelligence of Chelsea and xensington should be excluded from all share in the government of the country. Political freedom of action would in this way also be given to the rural Population of Middlesex, and certainly-the Iiddle,ex farmer is a person to be int-ruated with the franchise fully as much as the farmer of any othe'r county in the kingdom-to -make no mention Of
the "villa" population, among 'whom are num-, -bered some of the most intelligent men in the 'country. At present the great bulk of the con-stituency is sunk in apatby and lethargy. They really do not care to exercise the franchise-very frequently not even to claim it. Neithier of the candidates at the Election just over had even an approximate idea on the evening before the poll of -his relative strength, for none could tell how much or how little of the constituency could be stiw=d from its accustomed indifference. The result was in every respect satisfactory, but there were more than enough electors left umpolled to convert e, ven Lord CjnnasA's minority into an overpowerixng majority.

GxENmufi THEATRICcAL FN-D.-The twelfth anniversary of this institution was celebrated on Monday evening by an excellent dinner at the Freemasons' T;vern, to which about 200 gentlemen sat down, under the presidency of Mr. Samuel Phelps, who was sugorted by Mr Charles Dickens, MIr. Buckstone, Mr. Mark Lemon, Sir C. ibbetston, Mlr. W. Sams, MIr. Ledger, Mr. W. Creswick'
M[r. E. T. Smith, Mr. T. P. Cooke, Mr. H. Hill, Mr. W. Fawcett, &c. The festival was graced by the presenoe of several ladies, and the musicalarrangements were under the direction of Mr. Lovell, who presided at the pianoforte, and who, togetherwiththe eminentvocalists andinstramentalista under his direction, gratuitously enhanced the evenine's entertadnment. The usual loyal toasts having been duly honoured, the chairman proposed " Increased prosperity to the Royal General Theatrical Fund, whose object it is to render easy the deolining years ofthose who have spent their lives in ministering to the pleasure and instruction of others through the mnedium of the stage." He said that he had that night to advocate the cause of those little wheels of the histrionic maehine who worked below and were Ecarcely heard, but without whose co-operation the great wheels could not move. From long experience and from remarkable statistics he could safely assert that civilization, in exercising ber influence upon large masses of the people, could receive no greater aid than that afforded by drauiatic exhibition, and he therefore, on behalf of this inatitntion, claimed sup. port from society at large. The toast having been fulln
honoured, Mr. Buckstone proceeded to give a detailed state. ment of the finances of the institntion, from which it ap. peared that in the course of its 19 years' existence it has accumulated a balauce of about 10.0001., although the sum paid even during the last 12 months to performers claiming their annuities amounted to 7701., a considerable amount having been also paid during the same period for funerals, &c. Her Majesty had again sent a magnificent donation of 100M. to the fund. He availed himself of that opportunity of declaring that for the small remuneration recently given to an actor for his services at Windsor Castle neither the Court (which was a generous patron of the drama) nor the director of its theatricals was responsible. A liberal sum was always allowed for those performaneos, and he (Mr. Buckstone) had always been. well remunerated for his sorvices at Windsor Castle. Ia these sectarian times every performer ought to be proud that his Royal mistress patronized his art in her own halls. He (Mr. Buckstone) had pleasure in announcing that the amateur performance at the St. James's Theatre in March lsst on behalf of this iustitation realized 761. He hoped that other amateur companies would generously exert themselves in its aid. Foremost among those gentlemen who by their presence gave encouragement to these annual festivals was their hest and most faithful trustee, Mr. Charles Dickens, who made any dweUing honoured by his presence anything but a Btcmt Rouse. He was afraid that Mr. Dickens world have beenr away electioneering or contesting the representation of Middlesex that day, as he was sure to be put at the head of the poll by any constituency in the Ing, dom that he might eanvass. The chairman proposec "The health of Mr. Charles Dickens," whose name ha& become a "Household Word." Mlr. Dickens, on rising to respond, was greeted with loud cheers. ae said that
bad been rather startled by Blr. Buckstone's allusion to the, representation of Middlesex, and assured those present that his ways of life and means of usefulness, such as they were had been long chosen, and that he never intended to, canvass any "'sex" except that by which the assembly, was graced and that other sex seated at the tables. HII position bound him to official reserve, and he oouldno% therefore, even if he wished, make a lengthy or iuteresting speech wLth respect to the condition of the society, but the fact was that Mr. Bucklstone's detailed statement had exhausted that subject. Mr. Dickens. in proposing the next toast-viz., "The bealth of Mr. Phelps--saidhe believeA that the theatre was one of the most efficient maeans of edu.. cating the people, and he warmly eulogized Mr. Phela'4 ransagement of Sadler's Wela Theatre. The chaifrauL having responded, the remaining toasts were disposed of. The oollection during the evening aumounted to 4701. Mr Toole efficiently dischrgedo the duties o toastmaster.

The learned gentleman who appears to have been rather scurviI treated by the Liberal Club, and by not a few of the Roman Catholic clergy, preferred withdrawal from what promised to be an angry contest between parties profeosing the samo political principles.

QUEEN'S Cosnrry.-It is shted that another of those disgraceful coalitions which have of late characterized the history of Irish elections has just been concluded between the high Conservative, Sir Charles Coote, and Mr. Michael Donne, the late idberal representative, aud a member of the onco colebrated "brass hand." The cause of thisattempt to defeat the claims of Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the leading proprietors in the county, cannot be satisfactorily

Now, Sir, as chairman of Mr. Cobdents eleaion committee, I feel bound, in duty to truth and to Sir John W. eamsden, to state that I have not heard of one single instance in which, during the contest between Mr. Cobden and Mr. Akroyd, the influence of the landlord has been exercised even i the b liehtest degree. On the contrary, I have reason to hi hat Sir John's agents had intrcetions to abstain altogether from any interferonce, and to leave the tenantry to the full exercise of their unbiased choice. I feel it the more imperative upon me to nake this state. ment through the medium of Tetorsvh, as I find that the provincial papers are giving circulation to the articleowhich contains the above extract.
The courn e whch Sir J. W. Pamsden has taken since he entered Parliament has afforded extreme gratification to the Liberals of this borough, and his conductith c t to the recent election has greatly enhancurse t f cod
on the part of the Liberal electors who supported Mr. Cobden, and who in former elections have had to contend against the influence of the landlord.

Unsuccessful Attempt To Capture Fugitive
uNSUcCEss1YUL AUxxPT TO CAPTURE FUGITIVE SLAvEs.-On Tuesday morning last our town was thrown into much commotion in consequence of an almost successful attempt to capture eight runaway slaves for whom rewards are offered of upwards of $3,000. It seems that some time dnuing Mionday a man came to Sheriff Green with the information that he had discovered eight runaway negri es and had made arrangements to have them in Dover that mzght, the negroes supposing they wero to be concealed in town until the next night and then wend their way upward. Accordingly, about 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning the man and the negroes appeared at the gaol. While the sheriff was dressing they all entered the gaol, went upstairs (in the dark), found an open room and went into it, but there being no fire they came out into the entry. By this time the sheriff had dressed and followed them upstairs, supposing that he would find them in one of the rooms, and that all he would have to do would be to close and bolt the door. On discovering that they were all in the entry, the sheriff returned to his room for his revolrer. The negroes, anxious to get to a fire, followed him down and were all in the sheriff's room, where his wife and children were asleep, before he could seize his revolver. By this time the suspicions of one of the negroes were arouaed and with the exclamation "1 he didn't Blke the looks ob de mace; rse gwine out o' dis," be bolted for the vindow. The sheriff seized him, and while engaged in the struggle the rest of the negroes burst through another window and escaped, first scattering the fire over the floor,the man standing trembling in the door like the veriest craven-hearted coward. The she-if, alarmed by his family and the fire, let go the negro for a moment, when in an instant he bomuded throu h the window and was *one. Thus they all escaped. Aix of them were tracked to a house in Camden, but the officers could not enter for the want of sufficient warrant, which the magistrates said they had no power to give. On Tue-day night, it is currently reported, the six were conveyedto the house of a man reiding near 'Willow-grove, whence they wer, forwaraded up the country by the forest roads, or ratherom the underground railroad T heother two were seen shoxi

In 1,08 of these rooms-all, In fwct, that are at Presnt inhabited-there are 5,701 inmates5 belongin to :768 families ; and, to say nothiug of the too frequent ocerroen Of what may be regarded as anees4etouas Overcrowding, where the husbansd, the wife, and yount family of fouLr or ire children are cramped into a miserably small and ill-oondItIoned- room, tbere are numerous Instancs where adults of beth cexes, beloeaginig to different families, arec lodged ia the eamne room, regavdjlu', of jall the common decenlcies of life, and where from three to five adults, menk sod wroment, besiaes a train or two of children, are aceustoeed to herdLtogethber like brute beast or lsavage,-where oall the omoes Of nature areprormed in the =ost Public sod offensire manner, and whbere every human ins tinct Of proPriety and docency are smothered.

Suabistances as these, and, I might add, Others Of even more extreme debasement, are not uncommon within the walls of thscity : and though they call1 loudly for interference, yet I hardly know how the powers Of this commission can he best exercwise n-sppresing them.

And ti4hy do they act thus It ig beuse the badenoftbe por_, rato presses so unequally and unjustly on tbt meet destitute parxsies. ltls in tb e poorest parihze only ve wehear of officil inhumnility and the niggardly dole of IL per week to=en crippled with ' disease and worn out by old age. Wor is this tohewondered at when needy ratepayers are oftes goepelled to pawn their goods and chattel to tisfy t$e de-. mnds of the poor-rate collector.
You advocate central esual. wards, supported by uion rates; Thisis aetep in the tight direction; its defect i3 that it'does not go far cnougL . A metropolitan rate for an1 the expenses of the'poor would settle at once "parochial pettifogging and cunning, one parish striving to sbove it3 burden upon another, anad each only aiming zt getting off with is httle expense as possible." Besider, on what prih: Cipe ii -the amount of unional contribution to these centrali h'wvrdsto. be calculate&? Not surely as in al forMe'c calilationsof a like character-the poorest pstishes to piy the largest share. If so, the eastern distriets wilL uot look Upon the institution of such wards With any degree of satisfaction.
St. George's in the East is in itsdlf a union, How is its quota to be calouated? The rates now are 5s. in the pound, and the number of inmates in the workhouse, &c, last week was as follows

In 1853 the number was 1,0or; in 1854, 1,147; in 1835
1,279; in 18506, ,289. Its contributory power is thus already strained to the utmost, and Many of the adjoining parishes are in the same sad predicament. Last year the poor-rateexpenditure of the parish ws 1-30th of the whole sm raised in the metropolis, its population is about 1-50th and its property-ta value is only 1-120th of the value of the metropolis, In other word; the poor-rates paid by its 50,000 people are rly double what 50,000 Londoners generlly pay, nd they are four times as much as the same amount of London property on the average is called upou to contribute. To inerease the taxation of such an over. burdened union would be a mockery, let the purpose be ever so laudable or ever so necessary for the staety of the State.
A sa this is not An isolated case, it is the cse of fourfifths of the eastern parishes. The establishment of central casul wards will not relieve them The common pure for the poor instead of the local one, the metropolitan instead of the parochial fand, is the only remedy.
The fear of extravagance is very much exaggerated. Why should we be afraid that parish officers may become too liberal? Their fault now Ig clearly on the other side. What, moreover, is the duty of auditors and inspectors? Why should not tbey be trusted to check prodigality, if we cannot trust the hon ourable and business-like men who usually compose ourboards of guardians? I quite agree with the opinion expressed in your columns to-day, that " Nobody can maintain the abstract justice of a system in which some parishes are almost crushed by the Poor Law, and others are hardly touched by it:" Why should the London Dock Company pay 20,0001. a -year for the poor, and the Bank of England only 301. ? It is unjust in every way, and that injustice must be remedied at any cost Fiaw justitia runt axlunm. Better a little extravagance than a gross ana crushing injustice.
It Was the deliberate conviction of 25 East-end Incumbents, recently summoned by their Rural Dean to consider the question of the equalization of the poor-rate-which incumbents represent a population of at least 250, 000 soulsthat this is the only feasible and certain remedy for London dcestitution; that it is the only possible antidote for a vst socil and moral evil; that it is, moreover, their bounden duty as Chrisian ministers to state this conviction to their bishop, and to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who is responsible for the peace of the metropolis; And, finally, to present their petition to both Houses of Parliament to take the matter into their serious consideration, and pass a law to the effect that the close rich parishes of London shall pay at least an equal share of the expense of supporting the London poor as the open and destitute ones do.
I sIm satisfied that the time is not far distant when the fear of possible extravagance will yield to the fear of admittod injustice, when an equitable settlement of metropolitan pauperism wiU be made at the demand of an en. lightened public opinion, and the Bank of England, the wealthiest corporation in the world, be made to pay for its magnificent and spacious buildings a considerably larger sum than is now demanded as poor-rate from his humble parsonage, from Yours, &C.,

A TRAGEDY IN KENTUCKY.-This neighbourhood
A TR&AGEDY nz KENTUCKY.-ThiS neighbourhood was the scene of a most shocking tragedy ast Sunday night, some notice of which appeared in the last Mfays'arlk Eagle. The circumstances have awakened an intense excitement throughout the adjacent counties. The person killed lived about six miles from this villae, and though well to do in the world was not of very good repute. His name vas James Taber, and he was murdered bv his own slave in his own house while lying in front of the n on the floor asleep. The negro was convicted of the act to-day under his own. confession, and is to be hung on the 14th prox. He is not at all insensible of his crime, and seems to have been terribly wrought upon by his late master, and declarec that he does tot regret the deed, that he was frigbtfully ill-trcated personaUy, and was time and again ordered by Taber from the house, for the sole purpose of compeUing the wife to submit to his (Taber's) brutal and de praved lusts, and to this latter cause may be traced the l tragedy w5sich follows. After be consummated it both himself and his wife fled from the house and secreted themselves near by in a thicket. In the morning they were pursued by the neighbours, and the woman, in a paroxysm of fear, when she saw they were likely to be found, rushed to a smaU stream at hand and drowned herself in water not exceeding three feet deep, before she could be overtaken. The man, however, was captured, and at once admitted his puilt, and whoUy exculpated his wretched wife from any sbare in the deed, or any knowledge of it until the mement the axe clave the head of his master in twain. Such a cbapter as this does not need any comment. It is easy enough to conceive bow these poor wretches must have been excited by the outrageous treatment they received from their guilty master, hut while the laws of the State inflict almost summarv punishment upon them they take no cognizanee of theoffences gainst them, and their oppressorsgo offscotfree. Is it r cause or wronder thit suc ascenes as his are so freIuent in slave States? Bather is it not to be wondered that they are not every-day occurrences? While this tragedy waa being enacted in the country another scene was transpiing in the Court-house in town. A young nman was being tried for murdering his neighbour, having first struck him with a bludgeon and then stibbea him to the heart, killing him dead, aU in broad daylight, and in tho presence of half-a-dozen witnesses. All this was proved clearly and beyond nuy sort of dispute-the first word, the blow, the stab, and the death. And yet this man was declared innocent. Liko young Wood, he was too respectably connected and too weadthy to fear conviction.

[A portion of the foUowing appeared in our sesond eol. tho of Yesterday.:-I
PARIS, APRIL 6, 6 P.M,I
A private letter from Stockholm of the 30th mentions that the Swedish Diet, which at first had beeu going on rather slowly with its work, was at last beginning to discus seriously the many reforms projected; and, though the Government met with many dificulties, ryet that, on the whole, the session would be favourable in its reaults. The allowance to Prince Oscar, the King's second son, has passed by considerable majority, and his Royal Highness was soon to start for Nassau, where his marriage with the Princess Sophia, sister of the reigning Duke, will be celebrated in the beginning of Jaue. It is in comDliance with the wishes of the illustrious fia?weu's family that the nuptials shall take place before the Princess leaves her native country.
The abolition of the Sound Dues has caused very great satisfaction to all classes in Sweden, as the trade of the country is thus relieved from a yearly tax of no less than a million of rixdollars, or the interest of a capital of 20,000,000 rixdollars. The proposed new tariff is a worthy addition to this treaty, and wil place the customs law of Sweden on the most liberal footing, making free trade a reality in that country.
The Prince Royal, who as Viceroy of Norway now resides at Christiania, will return in May to take command of a numerous camp for the summer exercises in the neighbourhood of Stockholm.
The press of Sweden, and indeed the nation at large, was following with intense interest the result of the elections ia England. Except a few narrowminded " Conservatives," who echo the high-sounding phrases of the Nord and of other Russian organ7s in Belgium and Germany fagainst Lord Palnerston, the general feeling in Sweden was in his favour. I repeat these assurances on the authority of a Swedish gentleman of ability and rank. My correspondent observes,-
"Lord Palmerston's unflinching energy during the late ocatest, his vigorous straggle against the invasion in the East, and his untiringactivity for the honour of his country, lead us to believe that he will not neglect her interestain the far north. We trast that he will draw stiUl closer the bonds that unite England to Sweden, and that he will not allow her to meet the common foe single-handed in the event of any future aggre3sion."1
The policy of the Russian agents in Sweden, as well as everywhere else, is to cry down the treaty of .he 21st of November 1856, as extorted from Swedea by England, and also to represent England as on the very eve of breaking off the alliance with France. The writer concludes:-
"I need hardly repeat that these rumours find very little credence here. On the contrary, we hope that the union between the two greatest nations of Western Earope May long continue, as a guarantee for tho independence of the world, and we look to England for support in our self assumed duty of the jealous sentinel of universal liberty."
There is nothing new to say of the Neuchatel question, as the Conference has not held a sitting since Friday. The Plenipotentiaries are agreed on some leading points, and the Swiss and Prussian Ministers have accepted them ad referendum, and are now waiting for an answer from their respective Governments. These points I have already mentioned,-the amnesty for those who took part in the events of September last year, and for those who were convicted of political offences previo-us to that period, and the principle of the payment of the expenses occasioned by that outbreak, though the amount is not yet fixed. The Prussian Plenipotentiary also required the suspension of all discussion on the Constitution of NeuchMtel until after the lapse of a year, or at least of six months. The Conatitution of the Canton of Neuch&tel may be revised at the end of May next, and the King wished that there might be sufficient time for the public excitement to cool down. The Swiss Plenipotentiary had no power, nor indeed has the Swiss Government, to make such a concession, which would be a violation of the Federal Constitution. He consequently resisted it, and the other Plenipotentiaries, excepting bf course M. de Hatzfeldt, sided with him. The PrussianMinisteracceptedthedecisionofthemajority ad referetdum, and on this point also an answer from Berlin is waited for. There are five or six other points which wiU doubtless come before the Conference at its next sitting.
It is very generally believed that M. de Morny will return soon to Paris. He is now only waiting for the treaty of commerce between France and Russia to be signed; and, as we are told that all the articles are agreed on, it is supposed that the signatures will be affixed in the course of next month. M. de Mormy, it appears, has lost much of his influence at St. Petersburg. Certain transactions have recently taken place here which have given occasion for a vast deal of gossip; they chiefly relate to industrial interests of a complicated nature, in which his name constantly recurred. The Russians think that they do not add much digItmty to the Ambassadorial character, whatever they may to the speculator, and they are therefore beginning to look coldly on him. The Emperor appears puzzled what to do with him, and would prefer keeping him at a distance to having bim in Paris. If it become absolutely necessary to recall him-for an Ambassador deprived of influence at the Court to which he is accredited is worse than useless-it is expected that the Duke de Grammont, now at Turin, will succeed him, and the Duke would in that case be succeeded by Me Menval, who is now at Munich. The Grand Cordon of tbe Legion of Hlonour is to be sent to the Shah of Persia, and Feruk Khan, his Ambassador, is to be naned a Commander of the same order.
Tha unexpected increase in the rate of discount by the Directors of the Bank of England has created an unfavourable impression on the trade of Paris, which was beginnig to recover from the effectS of the long dead season through which it had passed. The manufacturers of Patis have, during the last week, received the visits of many commission agents, but their purchases have not been extensive. Although buyers are beginning to submit with less hesitation to the generai advance in prices on all description of merchandise they merely purchase sufficient for their immediate wants, still looking forward to better times. The accounts from the manufacturing districts are not so favourable as could be wished. Tbe sale of both silk and cotton goods has been limited during the last week. %he cotton goods manufacturers, both in Alsace and in Normandy, are loud in their complaints of the excessive price of the raw material used by them, which they say is out of proportion with that of wool, and that they are thus placed in a disadvantageous position as compared with the woollen manufacturers. At Lyons, on the contrary, raw silk has fallen considerably, notwithstanding the fears entertained of another bad crop in consequence of the disease among the silkworms. But still the price of manufactured Bilk iS higher than during former years, and nevertheless buyers demand concessions,
which the manufacturers say they cannot afford. The last accounts from New York, announcing that a modified Customs tariff will come into operation on the 1at of July next, encourage the manufacturers here to expect some profitable orders from the United States. It is further said that the stock of French goods is exhausted both in Germany and Russia, and that a demand may be shortly expected from those quarters. In speaking of the silk trade, it may not be inappropriate to observe, that the sale of French Cashmere shawls in Paris-a branch of industry unknown here 50
years since-now amounts to 30,000,Of. annually. Previously to that period the French iadies were entirely dependent on India for that useful article.
At present, the Court haviag patronized the French Cashmere shawl, little else is wore. The Paris cornmarket, as -well as those throughout France, continues to decline, and sales are difficult. The arrivals of wheat at DMarseilles were not numerous last week m consequence of the preralence of east winds,
but there is no consequent animation in the market. The tendency in the Paris floux-market during the last week has been downwards The highest price obtained for flour of the best quality was 73f. 50c. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. 1,000 sacks were eQl4 at that price, the united efforts of the speeustori, for a rise being only sufPieient to prevent it from falling lower. Good flour of the se ca quality is easily had at from 60f. to 65f. the sack, and thi at from WOf. to 55f. The stock of flour now disposable in the hands of the factors amounts to 17,000 quintals; and it is expected it will reach the figure of 20,000 metrlcal
quintals. The accounts from the agricultural dl. tricts as to the growing crops are most favourable. 'The alternate beat and rain have developed vegeta. tic,A in a most fortunate manner, and promise an ab,idantlharest. It is expeoted likeowiw that tbi
will be an exceptional year for fruit, and ,that the crop wiU be the most abundant seen for the last ten years. The price of wine still continues to rise in the market of Bercy. The opinion of many good judges on the subject is, that even if the next vintage should prove to be all that could be desired, still there will be no great reduotion in price, inasmuch as the stock of old wine is exhausted, and that there is but little of any description on hand. Letters from Nantes state that the holders of wine in that quarter are disposed to take all the chances of the next vintage rather than dispose of their stock of wines. Spirits distilled from beetroot are firm in Paris at I24f. the bectolitre, and in Bordeaux at 132f.; Languedoc brandy is quoted at Bordeaux at 215f. the hectolitre.
The show of prize'cattle at Poisy is to take place on Wednesday next. There are 404 animals entered for exhibition. Last year there were but 276. The number of oxen is 152, of which 64 are French and 88 foreign. The French animals are the best yet exhibited, but they are sadly inferior to the E nglish and Scotch.

VIENNA, AP.m 4.
The Vienna papers no longer carry on a war of words with the Turin organs of the press, and the latter are somewhat less violent than they were. The news of the interruption of the diplomatic relations between Austria and Sardinia has produced a very unfavourable impression in Lombardy. My opinion in respect to the inhabitanta of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom is unchanged. It is not likely that the Austrian Government will succeed in w'inng the sympathy of the nation, but it will assuredly display less hostility now that the brute-force system has been abolished. Whatever the Sardinianpapers maysay to the contrary, the journey of the E;mperor to the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom has not been in vain. The people have seen that His Majesty is desirous to improve their material condition, and that he is not likely to be deaf to any of their juBt and reasonable complaints. At noon on the 3lst of March Count Gyulai made Mis entry into Milan as Commander of the Second Army. The troops paraded, and the artillery of the forts saluted, but the Milanese, with whom Count Gyulai is anything but a favourite, remained witbin their four walls while his Military Excellency was passing in state through the streets of the city.
During the last year much has been said and written against the abuse of " crinoline," but the inhabitants of this city have just had a proof that it may sometimes be of real service to the wearer. A yOung English girl, who was employed as governess in the family of an emnploy4 was so dissatisfied with her lot that she resolved to put an end to her life by jumping from the ramparts into the dry moat. An officer who saw the poor girl put her suicidal design into execution states "that she looked like a balloon in the air." The height of the wall of the city at the spot where the attempt at felo de se was made may be about 45 feet, but the girl was so little hurt by her fall "that she walked away as if nothing had happened."
The day before yesterday it was definitively settled that the State should, during a period of three years, disburse 70,000fl. per annum for prizes to be given to the winners of races which are to be held at Vienna, Prague, Lemberg, Pesth, and Klausenburg. The prizes are to be in hard cash. The attention of those persons who are about to travel by way of Dresden to this cityis called to the fact, that " through-carriages" are now attached to each train, so that a person entering one of them at Dresden can remain in it until he reaches Vienna. Before the 1st of this month the travellers between Dresden and Vienna had to change carriages at Prague and at BrAnn.
A correspondent informs the Augsbuwg Gazefe that a civil war is likely to break out in Montenegro. After the death of the late Vladika there were two parties in Montenegro, and one of them was strongly opposed to the accession of a layman to the throne. This was the ola Montenegrin or Russian party. Russia fully expected that the Montenegrin Prince would endeavour to make some diversion in her favour during the war, but, as he remained inactive, the St. Petersburg Government has refused any longer to pay the stpend which the Vladikas (otherwise "the Church") have received from the Russian Sovereigns since the year 1721. At the outbreak of the wrar the Russian Colonel Kovalevaki endeavoured to excite the Montenegrins to break the peace, but Austria ordered the Servian Colonel Stratimirovich to take the field against him, and he was obliged to retire from Montenegro, as the mountaineers had great confidence in the Austrian officer, who was with them when they did battle against Omar Pasha. About three years ago Peter Petrovich, the brother of the President of the Senate, who is now here, was banw*hed by his nephew, Prince Daniel, and since that time the Russian party bas lost much of its influence in Montenegro. The new code and the new taxes have, however, caused great discontent in Montenegro, and the agents of Russia are now ondeavouring to take advantage of the strong feeling which there is against Prince Daniel.
The murrain has appeared among the cattle at Ungarisch-Hadisch, a station on the Northem Rail. road, at a distance of about 100 English miles from Vienna. Until now only two oxen have died, but a cordon has been established, and the price of moat must rise,as there is agreatcattle market atHradisch.

BERLIN, ApRn 5.
It would seem to be matter of current belief in St. Petersburg just now that Baron Stieglitz is rapidly arriving at a perception of the immense difficulties that await him, even in Russia, in disosinog of his railway speculation shares. It is affirmed further, that, in his consternation at the difficulties opposed to the shares being introduced into foreLon
markets, he has already represented to the Miniser of Finance the necessity of the State's conferring on this paper an absolute and intrinsic value, if it is to be generaly and satisfactorily introduced into the different Stock Exchanges of Europe. The Minister of Finance is stated to have taken these representations into favourable consideration, and some persons affirm even that he has already decided that the shares shall be receivable in accounts with all deposit banks of the empire up to two-thirds of their value. It must be presumed that this word " value" means the amount paid up; every other " value " would be still more visionary. The exertions of the company on the field of practical execution seem to be limited, as yet, to negotiations with the different towns through or near which the lines of railway are to be traced; and it seems clear from the turn these negotiations take that the number of shares taken by any town will be of great weight in deciding the direction of the respective lines. If this remark be well-founded aud just it would be but another proof that the interests of the eventual shareholders are being sacrificed to the gain of the original speculators.
We have now tolerably distinct information from St. Petersburg that the Emperor will not visit
Germany, Italy, or France thria mprng; that, in fact he will not at present leave his dominions. In addition to other reaons of State necessity for the Emperox's remainig 'at home thix may perhaps be assiRned, that the Empress expects to be co inod in the middle of April The Empress Mother, It U expected, will leave Italy in May and proebd-to pay a visit to the Couz (theGm DDko ofBe
She will passr on thence to'Wildbad; and-on her way back to St. Petersburg.at the commencement of' July will Atay a short time in Berlin, or rather in Potsdam. Though the Emperor himself will not visit Germany this spring, it ispoken of as tolerably certain that Prince G-ortschakoff, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and also General Sukhosane, the Minister of War, will come to Berlin on a visit.
The Austrian Minister in St. Petersburg, CoanL l Valentine Esterhazy, is said to have received, bu'
not at his. own request, a tolerably long leave of ab I sence; this step, if true, has been taken by the Austrian Cabinet proprio motu, to mark its displeasure at the attitude observed by the representstive of Russia at the Court of Turin. It is to the suiggestions of the Northern Power that the rulers of Austria attribute the line of conduct assumed by Sardinia towards her.
The Geographical Society of St. Petersburg seems, to judge by its last report, to do a little'in national economy as an accessory to its stud;yof the form of the earth. A x Lmansid, whom the society ha
has just sent out on a journey of discovery .int) civilized Europe, has been instructed to turn. hiis attention, among other thing,s, to 'the monetary institutions of other. countries, more especiaUy such as facilitate the money dealings of private persons by means of banks. Aother subject which 'this versatile and accomplished gentleman iS desire 1 .to "get up" is that of the principles on which .and tfhe means by which, the census of the popu lation is obtained in various. countrier. Thae prigcipal point of inquiry connectedwith this subject appears to be,-what are the problems which modern science looks to the statistics of population to solve ? In the meantime the society has issued a circular to all its corresponding members throughout the empire, requesting thema to procure 'accurate statistics of all the forms of disease thqt from time to time visit their neighbourhoods, or seem to be indigenous to them; to point out all circumstances that may possibly lead to a conclusioa as to the causes of these visitations; the belief. being that, although many of them may be traced to the soil or to the climate, yet many others are such as may be obviated by human foresight. The devas-
tation produced by epidemic and endemic disease in' Russia is one of the main causes, more particularly in the thickly populated districts, that the popula. tion does not increase: the statistical reports of the Cenral Medical Journal show that even in the two capitals of late years the numibars of deaths greatly exceed tho4e of births. Thus in 1855 there were in St. Petersburg 26,727 deaths to 16,092 births; in Moscow,S 13,78
deaths to 9,889 births. The statistics of the whole empire for 185 show, it i5 true, a more satisfactory rsult viz., 2,882,155 births and 2,148,233 deaths. Pinla'Ad andl Poland are not included in this statement: in the former the excess of births over deaths was still greater; in Poland, on the contrary} the excess was on the side of deaths. For last year ,and this it is to be apprehended that Finland will .supply afearful contingent to the list of deaths, in consequence of the dreadfulfamine now reigning iu the northern regions.
The greatest anxiety and suspense are felt in the commercial world with reference to the new tariff, 346e,publication_ of .which is expected every day; Most merchants are keeping back their orders till they know what the new import duties on their articles are to be. Within the l few days a house of business has been opened in St. Petersburg under the firm of Masurin and Lapin; it is said to be the ;first instance known in Russia of two Russians carrying on business in partnership.
The last accounts from Sebastopol describe life Ahere as beginning to be somewhat more lively Ithan it has been since it ceased to be the centre of interest to all Europe. The number of persons who have already returned to the town is described as wonderful, considering how little accommodation -there is for them in the houses. Among other attempts at revivification a theatre has been opened there by the same man who owned the theatre there before the siege, and who moved out of the way of war's alarms toSimpheropol duringthe war,and gave drarmatic representations there. His efforts to draw good houses onlisold site seem tobe successful. No hopes seem at present to be entertained that the t&wn 'will ever recover its former importance, unlesa the Government make it again a military and hiaval dep6t, and of this there is no inkling at present. In Eupatoria also the inhabitants are beinning to return to their homes and to settle down again. Next summer the mud-baths of that place,
which enjoy a certain degree of celebrity, are to be reopened;
The silting up of the various ports of1the Black Sea is said to form a subject of anxious solicitude to the Marine Department. In NicholaiefF, now the most valuable of all the ports, this process is described as proceeding most rapidly.
An article in the Northem Bee, in an effort to prove the future prosperity of tho railway from Moscow to Theodosia, affords us some, interesting data. The chief article of export from the Taurio Peninsula is salt; at present from 5,500,000pods to 11,000,000 pouds of this article are exported to the western provinces; the salt lakes, however, are capableofproducing 33,000,000pouds. The transport of the salt is performed by about 120,000 vehicles, which pass throug,h Perekop betwreen the months of May and September. On the other hand, no less than 300,000 of such vehicles are employed every year in bringing the grain from the interior to the ports for exportation. As -with the salt, so it is with the fruit in the Crimeaonly one-third of it is carried to market. The cultivation of the vine, the breeding of cattle, aud agriculture in general are all being starved, fromthe fact that the expensiveness of al supplies from the interior makes it impossible to keep a sufficient number of hands to do the work. It is stated in this article that all the corn for the entire army in the Crimea during the war had to be brought there from the Western Provinces, and that the expense of transport were so great that while the tchetwert in Berirlaff cost 6-7 rubles, it cost in Simpheropol 16, and in Bakshiserai 20 rubles.

The squadron has already been greatly reduced by successive departures, and now only consists of the Royal Albert (flagship), the Curacoa and Vulture steamfrigates, and half-a-dozen gunboats.

The Coquette, Commander Glynn, wfill remain on this station and the small gunboat Boxer at the mouth of the banube. The Austrians are also evacuating the Pincipalities; hut they will not have left altogether before the 6th or 7th of April.
The Turkish Gazete of the 24th inst. amnounces
me tormation of a permanent diplomatic mission at St. Petersburg. Although the Czar has alwaya hal a representative at the Court of the Sultan there never has been a resident Turkish Minister at St. Petersburg. Hitherto the Turks have contented themselves with sending from time to time Extraordinary Ambaaadors, who have always returned as soon as the special object of their mission wa% attained. But when Mehemet Kibriali Pasba, who represented Turkey at the Coronation at Mosco0w, came back, the Chief Secretary, Server Effendi, iemained at St. Petersburg as Charg6 d'Affaires, and now he will be replaced oy Riza Boy, who will, have the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. Ri4a Bey has been a long time iu the diplomatic service. and has been successivedy employed in Paris, 'Vienna, and Athens, and everywhere he has been deservedly popular. Of all the young Turks formed in the Echo.,l of Redschid Pasha and in the foreign Courts Riva Bey is certainly the most distinguished, both by his natural intelligence and tact and by the varied information he has acquired; and he has consequently been a special favourite with the present Grand Vizier, who certainly could not have selected auy one better fitted to represent Turkey worthily and honestly at the Court of St. Petersburg.
A large steam navigation company has just been formed here, in which almot all the wealthy Puhas and the principal firms in Galata are interested.

NAPLES, Manro 30.
The tone of the Neapolitan mindfor the last fort,night has been that of mingled despondency and in'dignation. it has beenasumed as true that arranocments wereson the eve of completion betweeritoiis Government and those of the allies, and that the 'West was about to eat theleek. Such is the impres.. non which the Government through aU its various channels has been endeavouring to create, and the feeliTiof theLiberals has been calculated to awaken the sYmpathies of every just and humano man and the shauxe of every Englishian. I rejoice to add that; Lord PaTmnerstonei speechb which-arrived here yes-. terday, has saved England from the imputation of being a -party to. a measure invented to empty prisons on one day in order to filU them on the morrow. His Lordship has shown himself thoroughly master bf tlie case, and incerely is it to be hoped that the prestige of his high name wiU never be ruined by the sacrifice of Italian liberties. Al that your. correspondent hsa informed you of is but a tithe of what might be revealed, and that Lord *Palmerston, inatead of endeavouring to purge this Augean stable, should lend hi-mself to the support of 'measures the only tendency of which would have. been to. .increaae the evils of the country was a report calculated to detract from the honour of his name and from that .of our country. Time hinow proved the correctnems of my informati6n, which amounted to this,that Prussia was the -Power- which was endeavouring to produce an impression on the Governmeit; that its suggestions were of the most moderate and insufficient character; and. that the Agentine treaty was propo3ed as the basis of negotiations. This is the tenour of the intelligence which I hare sent from time to- time, - and nobly has Lord Palmerston responded to the offers. What the actual position now is it is difficult to say, but in diplomatic circles the strong impression is that things are in atau quo, and that there is no probability of a chanlge, there being a strong conviction .Qn the part of Government.of the divine right to do wrong, and an equally strong determination on the part of our Government to resist such a claim.. Thoee nearest to the person of His Majesty speak the same language, expressig their persuasion that no arrangement iS in prospect, and their regret -at a fact so ful of danger. My own oft-repeated opinion is that in a country where promises are utterly valueless the only efficient settlement of the Neapolitan question will- be a return to " legality" -I mean the constitution. Admitting all the evils consequent on a passsAe to a new sobial state, they cannot equal those of the present iniquitous and ferocious system of government.
I can now speak with even a little more certainty than in my -last-of thenew modification of tho Concordat. I believe that one great object contemplated is the abolition of the Royal exequatur for the introduction of Papal briefs. If so-and my authority isgood-the kingdom of theTwoSicilies becomes a footstool to the ambition of Rome, as Austria already ii. -Indeed, the assimilation of the two Concordats iz spoken of. Such an assimilation implies, -of course, an inereised political sympathy between the three Powers. You will find, too, that anothei point aimed at is the habolition of the Councils of -Hospitals and of lay commissions for the funds-of plablic charities. This is an object long desired by the-church, and in the Rimostranze of the Bishops, articles 8, 9 10, in the year 1849, it was stated that it should be " insisted on in the wishes expressed to His Majestlr." The charity funds had been groaly mismanaged and perverted by the lay administrators it is true, but too much confidence is not felt in the enlightened and disinterested conduct of the clergy. In fact, 50,000 ducata a-year will be placed at their disposal-a terrible and powerful agent of superstition, mental darkness, and political reaction. In 1848 a proposition was made to RuggieTo, the then Minister of Pinance, to invest that capital in the construction of railways and other public works. The proposition would have been introduced into Parliament had its sittings not been suspended, and the country wozld now, perhaps, have rejoiced in a net of railways. Instead of this, we are yet many years from the realization of such hopes, our street& are full of disgusting objects of misery and poverty, and our charity funds are devoted to what God only knows. To rettiruto the Concordat,other modifications are proposed besides those which I have already named, but I am not in a position as yet to say whattheyare. Ibelievethatthetenmerchant vessels which the Government was chartering in Sorrento, Procida, and Sicily were not for La Plata. It is probable that the expedition will sail in a Government steamer, under the convoy of the Regina and the Partenope, as far as the Rock; but, unfortunately, the arsenal seems to be deficient in aU the supplies necessaryfor fitting out a vesseL Such is the corrupt administration of affairs, and so irregular and uncertain the payments of Government that the arsenal is scarcely ever provided, and I hear the expedition will be delayed. The feeling against it in Naples is as strong as it ever was, and I do not hear of any additional volunteers from the Bagni. Government may, of course, transport any number of men it chooses, but it woil not alter the position by the shadow of a shade. I shall not weary you with a recital of persecutions and oppressions which are dailyrecounted to me,and which are fully borne out by what I know. Mrs. Beecher Stowe is now in Naples, and awakens much interest. Uide Tornc is well known here, having been translated twice and dramatized.

SPAIN.
(MOM OUR OWN cosatsroim-NTr.)
MADRID, APRiL 2.
The success that has attended its electoral operations has not had the effect of softening the heart of the Spanish Government and inclining it to clemency. After having by means of sach intimidation, coercion, and iliegality as may well appear incredible to those who have not the proofs before their eyes, composed a Chamber with its own employes and adherents, it proceeds to punish those by whose neglect of the prescribed precautions an Opposition candidate 'has here and there obtained election. At Cadiz the Ministerial nominees deemed their election secure-so much so that theyheld it to be- iuperfluous trouble to visit their constituents,
ancd bIugered, confident of the result, among the fleahpots of Madrid. Meanwhile, by a well managed and unforeseen coalition of the Progresistas and icalvarists, Opposition candidates were returned. Thereupon appears in to-day's (azeffe the dismissal of Don Rafael Navascues, Governor of the province of Cadiz. Of course it was his fault if the Government candidates were defeated. He has been either clumsy or constitutional-in either casoe a grave fault, and he is accordingly now turned out of office as a warning to others.
The press comes in for its share of persecution. In its number of the 22d of March the lberia published an article questionig the authority of the decisions of Cortes elected in the manner that these were then expected to be, and since have been, The Censor allowed the article to pass, warning the p1aper, hovwever, that he woulda denounce it if published. It appeared, and the Government now prosecutes the lberia, demanding the highest penalty, which is. 80,000 reals. Senor Olozaga, to whoso ready-and pungent pen rumour, I know not with wha't foundation, has attributed the articlo, will defend the paper before the tribunl
There have again been rumours of a Ministerial crisis, but I believe them to be unfounded, and
that, barring Paae caprces and the chapter of accidents, th-i Cabinet will last till the meeting of the Cortes. Whenever a change does take place tho genzeral opinion at p resent seems to be that eitber Beltran de Lis or ~Bravo Murilo wilb charged to construct a Cabinet. On the other hand, if the general aspect of affairs, the attitude of the Liberal party, the probabilites of poplr diturbace.
were such as to excito apprehensioas in the Royal mind, itis probable that Absolutist yearnings would be smothered for. a,time, that the -top taken would be in the contrary direction, and tha O'Domnell might come into power. At the present moment the state of affairs here is such as- to afford vide scope for conjecture and speculation, while it renders it extremely diffi. cult to form any deeided opinion as to what is likely to occtir in the course of the next two- or three months Those persons even who habitually express themselves the most positively concerning the future seem now content to await the course of events without hazarding predictions. If we reach the month of May without changes of importance, 'we may then obtain a little light upon our path, when we begin to see how the. Cortes work. The Congress wilL be sQ full of new men that it-is impossible to tell how parties will shape themselves. As is exemplified in the case of Senor.Campoamor, the Government cannot depend on all its nominees. And although it has worked successfully ht6 exclude Progresi3tas and V-icalvarists, it eems to have neglected the Absolutists, not a few of whom have obtained election. A -newspaper of this poli. tlcal party boasts. that in tie Bslearic islands alone,, out of six deputies retned, five are pure M3onara1i ts. There are persons fho believe that if the Cortes st for a month the Government id itself in a minority before theend -of that time since merous defections from the ranks of iu presumed supporteris, wil
swell the strength of the- combined minorities. This iS by no means improbable. ' '

The steamer which leaves Boston to-morrow (the Ametica) will take tye amended draught of the Dallas-Olarendon Treaty, or the modifications the United States' Governmient is prepared to ratify, ahould they be accepted by the Government of Great Britain. The amendments sent by the Senate to the Washington Cabinet were there further amended, and it is reported the Cabinet improve ments are alterations calculated to make the treaty more acceptable in Downing-street. It is taken to England bys special messenger.
There.has been a pause or lull in politics proper since the. adjournment of the Senate, just before the departure of the last ail. The new Adinini-r tration is not yet fairly in work, and it will be some time before it is. The Cabinet is itill besieged by a host of office-seekers, and the record of the chances and prospects of the candidates of the different sections anD, clques from the various States makes up the history of the week. It is very dull, and would be perfectly unintelligible:at a distance, resolving itself into a detail of- mer6 local and personal conflicts, in which, according to the inferences gathered from the slightest eircumtances, the section of Mr. Smith is hopeful to-day, and that of M.r. Brown equally sanguine to-tnorrow; Mr. Jones arrives the nex;t day as a competitor with both, and then all three are horror-struck at findingthePreuidenthas a leaning to a - fourth candidate, from some absurd idea that he would be the fittest man-as if that had anything to do with it. The prizes contended for are the foreign missions, places in the customhouses,andthepost-office. Tileverythingdisposableix given away the President will hate no peace. He has had too much experience to expect any. The most puzzling peculiaritY of the contests for office now carrying on at Washington is, that each candidate [of: any note is attended and backed bv a " follow-
ng"' of friends, in delegations - sometimes disrespectfully called- liques -who make his political influence visible. These supporters remai
at' the Federal city, where they run the risk of being poisoned by the air of bad-smelling hotels at four dollars a-day. They profess to have no purpose of their own, but do most of the badgering ne,cessary to insure the' success of their favourlte. The plan of attack 'diffeis according to the weight and numbers of the- separate parties, and the point is carried either by- -sap or stormL These bands of partisam are equivalent to what is elsewhere called
good interest."
The " rotatin'" p rinciple does not appear to work so-easily as expected. The South rejects it utterly; it would not increase its political power, to 'rhich all political movements there are subservient. In the North it is-not a universally-approved doctrine; the "ins" denounce it as heresy, and they are numerous. Accordingly the principle has not yet been practically put in force. Pulling a man out of his office is not unlike pulling a double tooth out of the man. Natnte resists the operation as long as possible. The' " decapitations," as they are ealled, or displacements on the principle of ." rotation" alone, have yet been very few, and it is understood a kind of respite is granted to the incumbents. But with tho axe suspended- over their heads their position is far from comfortable.
During this pause in public events there is something heavy in the political atmosphere, producing the impression that a storm is gathering.
The recent judgnieit or opinion, as some authorites qualify it, of the Supreme Court of the United States, is not pacifying men's minds, but the reverse. If it is accepted by the Northern States, the acquiescence is very sullen; there are ominous rautterings against it in many quarters; but there can be - no active opposition to it- for four 3 ears. But the questions it involves and raises, will not be suffered to sleep in the' interval. The decision, though, practically, its effect is only to leave Dred Scott in slavery, is another sign of the growth of the political influence of the South; it commands the judiciary as completely as the Legislature. The decision will act as a charm of powerful trouble in the next Federal election. It will be another weapon in the hands of the Abolitionists, and something more than an argument for those whose opposition to slavery is directed rather ag,inst the political Dower of the slaveholders than the institution itself: Its worst immediate COnse quence is that it produces a misgiving of future evil, which appears to be invading men's minds more strongly. The sudden discovery that the written Constitution of the United States, in which the.'word slave, or slavery, never once occurs, is really a cbarter in which slavery is inherent, that it carries slavery with it and protects it everywhere, is very disagreeable to whole masses of the Democracy of the North, even to those who have hitherto always gone hand in hand with the Democracy of the South. The Northerni interpretation of the Constitution mas, generally, that it purposely ignored slavery, tolerating it merely as a system of labou established in certain States, which must be left to the legisdation of those States to regulate. The union thus established became a political advantage, too great to be haSzarded by aeards attempting to extend the central power over davery where it existed. Any proscription of it by the Federal law would have broken up the alliance, or tended to do so; it would do so now infallibly. But the Northern Democracy never held that the Constitution was a " Slave Constitt tion," as it is now declared to be by a power from which there is no appeal. The North was supported in this view by the historical fact that the men who framed the Constitution all believed slavery an expiring system; most of them, and those the greatest among them, boped so, and did all they could to hasten its disappearanee. There are numerous passges in Washington'swritings which show he saw the evils of the system; he declares its extinction should be one of the main objects of legislition. But the founders .cf the Republic could not foreseeothe development of the agents that have since raised slaver into a g^igantic and almost irresistible influence. Atkwright, steam, the powerboom, and the cotton-rails of Manchetter have reversed all their calculations. What was only tolerated now rules, and through a supreme court, to which its political influenco his given amajority of Southern maers, interpretathe Constitution in its own favour. Tat thecharterof freedom now "carries slavery with it," is a fact that would astonish the men who wrote it and come. with something of a surprisEe on- their descendants T Ihere is no he]p, remedy, reversal, or appeal possible at present. T!he only suggestion yet mado of a means by which the unwelcome judgment easm-X reversed holds out a very diint prospect indeed of succes. Future Presidential elections ma

There has been an arrival from Nicaragua d ri,'

His men accused him -of cowardice and threatened to shoot him; the officers refused to servy under him, and Colbnel Lockridge deprivik him of his command, and sent him, down the river in disgrace and drunk-a very collapsed celebrity indeed. An English naval officer boarded the steamer on her arrival at Punta Arenas to mdae Eome inquiries, and the deposed Titus grosly insulted and threatened to shoot him, whereon a file of marines conveyed him-on board the Cosak a prisoner; buthe was soon afterwards released by the commandingofficer. Hewasseenfor a space walk-. ing about the town with a revolver, but disappeared on board the first steamer, leaving his destination indefinite. There are no accounts of Walker him self, except rumours of two attempts by him to take San Jorge, which were repulsed. In one of them hIs men, worn out by marching, and irritated by the illtreatment they had suffered from their officers, refused to advance ; the first time disaffection has shown itself openly, though desertions have been numerous. Only a few of them fired some shots into the place, and-the attempt completely failed.
The Tennessee sailed yesterday for the Isthmus, but Walker's supplies hence are apparently all cut off; not a single emigrant or recrumt went by her. New Orleans and Sn Francisco still furnish some.
The National Hotel at Washington has been finally shut up by the Board of Health as ininhabitable. It has poisoned between 200 and 300 persona 'with mephitic air, less by breathing it, it is supposed, than by infecting the meat hung in the larder, which thus became deleterious. There are all sorts of terrible rumours abroad of a conspiracy among the blaclc servants to poison the President and his Staff, in revenge for the defeat of Fremont. Reports have been raised on less plausible appearances; for the President is still suffering from the eSects of the disease induced; but the cause, as far as-can be ascertained, was bad drainage.
Colliery Explosions.
COLLzEr YxXPLOSIOZrs.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES.
Sir,-I am induced by the late fatal explosion at the Lundhill Colliery to request the favour of you to permit me, through the medium of your journal, to inquire of those who are practically acquainted with the working of coal mines, whether any good use could be made of a lamp so construActed as to give a steady, safe, and brilliant gas-light in the midst of the most inflammable firedamp? Whether such lamps would be useful to the miner if fixed in the neighbourhood of the workings,-so fixed as to cast their lights along the large galleries technically called " boards," and by meaus of reflectors to have their rays deilect,ed into the transverse galleries called " narrows 1" For, if such a lamp would be useful, I am prepared to say that I have contrived one possessing the capabilities above described, and I feel it due to humanity to make it publicly known.
It would ill become one so little versed in the subject of mines as I confess myself to be to pronounce dogmatically upon the best way of applying even my own invention; but, unless better advised, I should propose to cam, out my project by boring over the working part of the mine, and there introducing a pipe, in external appearance one, but in reality conDsiting of three distinct tubes; the object of the inner one being to convey gas to the lamps, that of the intermediate pipe to convey a constant cument of fresh air to the mine, while the outer tube would afford a ch.unel through which foul air would be brought to the surface by every returning stroke of the piston. The lamp is so constructed that a sufficient quantity of air to feed the flame would be llowed to pass to it, but the masin stream of air would pss round the fliamo, and rush out of an aperture or chimney above It with such velocity as would prevent the poesibility of the firedamp comiing into contact with it.
The above brief description may serve to show the principle of the plan I propose. I am aware that obstacles unknown to me, and only known to those who are practically acquainted with the economy of coalmines, will have to be encountered; ahd it is in the hope that some one posBessing this acquaintance may come forwarrd to gapple with these difficulties that I have been induced to trouble you on the subject. I know of no insurmountable obstacle in the Way of lighting up coalmines with gas, like the streets of a city, were it desirable-none so great as would have been seen 2) years ago to stand in the way of running a trai across the Straits of Menai through a sdf-supported tube, or of conveying a message to India and receiving back an answer in a few hours.
I will only add that, should this letter be the means of introducing me to such an individual, as above adverted to, I shall be happy to unite with him in the effort to ameliorate the condition of the miner, to whom we are all indebted; aid, although we may not fully suoceed at first, we may, by the blessng of God, do something to lessen the present fearful amount of loss of life, and consequebt family misery.

LAW REPORT.
ADMIRALTY COURT. TrFCTDAv APRTT. 7
TUT: ACTI1?.-SALVAGE.
(Before Dr. LUSnLNGTON.)
This was an action brought by the smack Britain against thoe'orwegian bark Actif, to obtain compensation for salvage services rendered to her in the North Sea on the 28th of -Stotember last. The merits of the case were argued on the 27th of February, and the Court awarded 1001.; but a question then arose as to whether, under these circumstances the salvors, under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, were entitled to their costs.
Dr. BAYFORD now contended, on behalf of the owners that it was the intention of the Act of Parliament that in cases where the claim for salvage did not exceed 2001. they should be decided by local magistrates, and not by this Court, provided the services were rendered within three mniles of the shore. In the present instance the services commenced beyond that distance, bat were not completed until the bark was brought into port. He submitted that the salvage awarded being only 1001., the salvors were not entitled to their costa.
Dr. JE.NxER, on the part of the salvors, relied upon the authority of the case of the Leda, and argued that the services havin originated upwards of three miles frorn the shore, they had a right to costs.
The CouJBT reserved its decision.
ThE MARY PLEASAMS.-SALVAGz
This was a suit promoted by Her Majests steamship Leopard againt the Mary Pleasaunts, to procure salvage remnuneration for services rendered to her on the 10th of November, 1855, and foUowing days, about seven miles to the westward of Eupatoria. The Mary Pleasants was employed in the transport service of the French Government, and had on board French troops, provisions, stores, &c. She was driven on shore by stress of weather. These services consisted in lightening the vessel and occasionally attempting to tow her off. The value of the ship, which alone was proceeded against, was 4,2471. On the part of the owners it was contended that the vessel was not towed off by the Leopard, but floated off, and that a smaU remuneration would be a sufficient reward.
The QUEEN'S ADVOCATE and Dr. SrLNxus were heard for the Leopard; Dr. BiYFORD and Dr. Twxiss for the Mary Pleasants.
The learned JUDGE said that the great difficulty in this case arose from the cargo, which was very valuable, not being proceeded against. It would be contrarv to aU prindples of justice to fix the entire burden of the salvage on the ship. He should not be justified in imposing on her more thin 6001., with costs.
THE JOSGE ANDRIES.-SilLVAGE.
This was an action brought by the fishing smack Intrepid against the Dutch gaUiot Jonge Andries, to obtain a reward for salvage servicca rendered to her on the 13th of November lat and succeeding days. The smack, as she alleged, when about 60 miles from Southwold, engaged on a fishing evyage for the London market, observed the gaUiot, distant about fourmiles, with a flag flying at the foretopgaUantimasthead. The galliot on nearing the smack begged the master and crew to come on board, and after some discussion an agreement was entered into for 501. to conduct the galliot to a Dutch or English pert. On the part of the owners it was contended that the 501. was to cover the expense of whatever services might be rendered, whereas the salvors alleged that it was for pilotage only ; that, in consequence of a hurricane which afterwards came on, tho smack was compelled to take the gaUliot in tow, and that that which was originally a piotage thereby became converted into a salvage service, for which they were entitled to additional remuneration. A tender of 501. was made, which the salvors refused to accept. The value of the property salved was 2,2701.
Dr. JxNeNc and Dr. DXAtN1 were heard for the salvors; Dr. ADDAMS aad Dr. ScsNsS for the owners.
The learned JUDGE was of opinion that the agreement was binding, and that it included all the services rendered. He therefore pronounced for the tender, with costs.
THE rERLA.-DERELcrT.
The steamship Gitana, while on a voyage from Hartlepool for Hamburg, fell in with a large bark, the Perla, at 1 o'clock p.m. on the 29th of September iast, with a siInal of distress flying. On nearing her it was found that she had been deserted, and was tossing about violently in tho sea. T'he steamer took her in tow, and after two days' severe labour conducted her in safety to Bridlington harbour. The steamer having instituted these proceedmge, a second aotion was brought by Captain Hans Pieper and four foreign seamen, passengers on board the steamer, to obtain a reward for services alleged to have been rendered by them. The valuo of the property salved exceeded 15,0001.
The QuXEN'SADVOOATF and Dr. DEANE were heard for the steamer; Dr. BAYFORD and Dr. WADDILOVE for the foreigners; Dr. ADDAS and Dr. WAMBEY for the owners.
The learned JUDGE awarded to the owners of tbe steamer, which he said had been the principal 8alvor, 1,5001.; to the captain, 500Z.; to the seamen, 8001., to be distributed ac cording to their rate of wages; to the four foreign seamen, the shares of ablobodied seamen; and to the foreign mr8ter, a double share.
COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, April 7.
COURT OF BAXYRUPTCY, Ba a..,w Apra 7.
IN RE GODDARD.
(Before Mr. Cominisnoner FOX RTnAn Ao I
The bankrupt was a provision dealer of London-wall and elsewhere. The facts of his case are these :-In January, 1856, he was solvent with a surplus of upwards of 3,0001. He became the purchaser of 26 shares in the Royal British Bank, in addition to 10 already held. CaUs being made upon him in respect of these shares he wss adjudicated bankrupt, giving up property to the amount of nearly 3,0001., and having only 1731. of trade debts. His application for a certificate was recently heard before Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, when that learned Commissioner said he felt some doubt whether he could grant a first-class certificate under the circumstances of a trader taking shares which involved unlimited liability, and, the case belonging to Mr. Commtissoner Fonblanque he would rather he should decido the class.
PMr. LINKLATER, for tho assignees, and Mr. BuRR. for the bankrupt, now again concurred in asking that a firstclass certificate might be granted.
In reply tol a question the Court was informed that in January, 1856, the bankrupt, without doubt, had a surplus of 3,3001t; that his trade debts were now 1731.; and that he had given up proprty which had realized 2,3001.
His HONourR said, having regard to Mr. Commissloner Holroyd having granted a first-class certificate in a precisely similar case, he had no hesitation in doing so in this in. stawce.

IN RE T. A.RCKIUTT.
The bankrupt was a timber merchant, builder, &Jc., of Oakley-square, Chelsea. This was tke certificate meeting.
.'Mr. Reed appeared for the assignees, and Mr. Lawrance for the bankrupt.
The chief allegations against the bankrupt were these,that, knowing a year beforo his bankruptcy that he was iusolvent to the extont of 1,7001., he had, about two months before signing a declaration of insolvency upon which he was adjudicated bankrupt, executed mortgages in favour of of Mrs. Atkinson, his mother-in-law, and Mr. Fesenymeber, his solicitor, of the whole of his property. Owing 4,6731. to unsecured creditors, the bankrupt had thus denuded himself of property of tho value of some thousands of pounds and left them without a shiUlling. The bankrupt had settled an annuity of 501. upon Mrs. Atkinson, which was altogether omitted from his books. A suit in Chancery had resulted in Mrs. Atkinson giving up a sam of 8001., two cottages, and the annuitv. A second suit aginst Mr. Feseny. mober, for the recovery of 4601. wvas stil pending,
Mr. LAWRAiNCE, for the bankrupt, ur"ed that the mortgage to Mrs. Atkinson consisted principafly of one that was previously in existence in favour of tlhe Argus Assuranceoffice. By placing Mfrs. Atkinson in the position of the Argus-office the estato had, in fact, been benefited. It was unfair, after tho compromise that had been made, to urge a fraudulent preference. Having on Saturday night got 8001. from Mrs. Atkinson, the assignees on Tuesday came to this Court for the purpose of opposing the bankrupt's certificate. Moat of the creditors were persons who, prior to the bankruiptcy, had been paid 10s. in theo pound in respect of their debts.
His HONOUR said ho would consider the case, and give his judgment on a future day.

IN RF T. RYDER.
The bankrupt is described as a merchant, of Old Broadstreet. This was the certificate meeting. o
Mr. Lawrance opposed for the assignees; Mr. Linklater sup ported.
The chief allegations against the bankrupt's conduct were these c y'hat beginmg withaknowndeficiency of 1,0001. he had aftertwo yeas tmdig ended with the folo wing items:
Unsecured creditors, 17,12t1. ; creditors holding security, 34,5161. There were, practically, no assets. The secured creditors beld consgpnments, upon 'which advances had been made. T-he bankrtspt took credit for a surplus of 6,8521. from these consignments, but the creditors did not expect a surplus of a single shilUing. The bankrupt's personal expenditure had been at the rate of 1,0001. a-year, he being insolvent all the time and carrying on a losing trade. This pauper merchant had had accommodation bils and share traDsaction5, as might be supposed. The practico which hid recently sprang up of merchants without capital making cotsignments of goods abroad, and carrying on by means of obtaining advances upon goods as soon as purchased was one that called for remark. Thebankrupt's lossesincluded'l14D. on Consols, and 1801. on lapd and mining sbares. The bankrupt had, it was submitted, brought himself within the A4t vwhich referred to a loss to the extent of 200L on one year by gaming or wagering. The 201st ssotion, which referred to the loss of 201. in one day, wascited as specially applying to the case. It was asked on this ground of gaming tht the certificate be altogether'refused.
Mr. LihgrATrE5 said, he was quite taken by surprise by the character of the opposition. Conisidering tbe, highly peualconsequenc& that attached to the offence of gaming he suggested an adjournment. The bankrupt denied the allegations, and an adjournment would enable him to meet the charges against hlimh.

(Before the RECORDER.)
John Tobin, 26, John Davis, 18, John Vernon, 40, and George Brodrick (who surrendered to take his trial) mere indicted for stealing a quantity of pieces of hide, the property of Arthur Waring.
Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Cooper conducted the prosecution.
The prosecutor, it appeared, carries on an extensive business as a hide and skin merchant in Bermondsey, and the prisoner Tobin was for a short time in his service, and thus, of course, had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the premises. It was clearly proved that he and the other prisoners had gone to a shed belonging to the prosecutor and taken away a considerable quantity of hides, and the property appeared to have been carried off in the most open manner, the neighbours not entertaining any suspicion, on account o . Tobiu's formerconnexion with the prosecutor's establishment.
The prisoner Tobin made no answer to the charge, and the others merely stated that they had acted under his directions, and that they were not aware of there being anything dishonest in the transaction in which they were engaged.
The jury found all the prisoners Guiftfi.
The prisoners John Tobin and John Vernon were then charged upon another indictment with stealing two cwt. of hide pieces, value 111., the property of the same prosecutor, and Alfred Bevington, an elderly person of gentlemanly appearance, andJames Proctor, a gentlemanly-lookingyonug man, who surrendered to take their trial, were charged wlth feloniously receiving the property knowing it to have been
The samo learned counsel were retainoe on behalf of the prosecution. Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Serjeant Parry were spedally retained, with Mr. Robinson, to defend Bevlngton and Proctor.
The evidence in this case clearly proved that the prisoners. Tobin and Vernon had been goilty of stealing the property in question, and the only point for the consideration of the jury was whether the charge of feloniously receiving the property was made out against the other defendants. It appeared that, in consequence of the discoveries that were made by the prosecutor as to the plunder that had been committed upon his property, and other facts that came to his knowledge, he went on the 2d of February to the premies of the defendants, Bevington and Proctor, who carry on an extensive business as glue merchants, near the prosecutor in Bermondsey, and made some inquiries of tnem, the result of which was that he aecertained that they had purchased' a quantity of hide pieces of the prisoner Tobin, for which they had paid him 32s. per cwt., it being alleged that the axticle was worth 75s. per cwt. The purchase of the property at a price so much under its real value was the principal point relied upon in support of the prosecution, but it was elicited in the course of the case that every transation with Tobin was regularly entered in tho books of the defendants, and that there was not the slightest concealment in any respect. It also appeared that Tobin was known to be a man who went about the country collecting small lots of the article in question for the purpose of disposing of it to wholesale dealers, and that the sales were effectea by sample, and there wan no proof that Messrs. Bevington and Proctor ever saw the article that was delivered in bulk, or that they were aware of its quality. The prosecutor likewise stated that he found the hides in an open shed upon the premises, where they could be Eeen by any one.
In answer to a question put by Sir F. TEESIGER the prosecutor said that he hbad nown Mr. Bevington 20 years, and he at the present moment filled the offices of churchwarden of the parish and treasurer of the Free Grammir SchooL HE aeo said that he had no vindictive feeling whatever to gratify by the prosecution, and he was aboqt to enter into a statement of the motives that had induced him to prefer the charge, but he was stopped by the Cour, and told that sach a statement could not be received.
Sir F. THFsIGER made a most eloquent appeal to the jury on behalf of his clients. Ie contended that the evidence had altogether failed to make out that the puichase had been effocted with any guilty knowledge, and he urged upon them the improbabiIity that a person of the advaucqd age of the prkoner Bevington, who had for 40 years filled a responsible and Important position in the parish in which he resided, and who had a family of 10 children lookdng itp to him should have put in peril everything he held dear in the world for the trifling advantage he would have derivdd from this transaction. Sir F. Thesiger then proceeded to comment upon the evidence that hadbeen adduced for the
rosecution, and contended that all the facts that had teen deposed to not only failed to establish the guilt of his clients, but, on tho other hand, showed that there was an entire absence of guilty knowledge on their part In the transaction.
The following witnesses were then examined to speak to the character of the defendants:-
Mr. B. Drew, a magistrato for the county of Surrey, said he had known Mr. Bevington 50 years, and during all that period he had never heard- him spoken of in any other manner than as a man of the highest honour and
integrity.
Tho Rev. John Davis, the ordinary of Newgate, said he had known Mr. Bevington 24 years, and ho had never hesrd of a blemish upon his character.
Mr. J. Neale said he had known Mr. Bevington 30 years, and ho gave him the same character.
The Rev. Mr. Evans said that he was incumbent of Bermondsey in 1829, and he had known Mr. Bevington from that time, and he always bore the charaoter of a benevolent, honourable man.
Several other highly respectable witnesses gave similar evidence both with regard to Bevington and his partner, Proctor.
The RECORDER then summed up the evidence with his usual care aud impartiality, and
The jury, after deliberating for a short time, returned a verdict of Guilty against Tobin and Vernon, anci Acquitted Bevington and zroctor * the foreman adding, after he h,d delivered the verdict, that the jury were of opinion tl t Messrs. Bevington and Proctor would do wel to be m h careful in making such purchases in future.
There was an attempt at applause when the verdict wms delivered, and the defendants were ordered to be at orce* discharged from custody, Mr. Bodkin having jpreviously stated that there was another indictment, on which the defendants Bovington and Proctor were charged with feloniously receiving other property, but, as all the facts hid been proved on the former inquiry, he thought it unnecessary to proceed with that charge.
The prisoners who had been convicted were brought up for judgment at a later period of the day, and Tobin. who appeared to have taken the principal share in this robbery, was sentenced to 18 months' hnprisonment and hard laboIr, Vernon to 12, Davis to 6, and Brodrick to four months of the same punishment.
Mmar Ann Olive, 34, widow, was Indicted for stealing a guantity of metal, the property of Messrs. Spottiswoode asd Co., the Queen's printers.
Mr. C. Sleigh conducted the prosecution.
It appeared that the prisoner was employed to work about th oIIIGO of the prosecutors, andathat she took advantage bf tho confidence that was placed in her and purloined a large quantity of typo, which sho sold to a person named Mey4o, a metal dealer in Clerkenwell, for 2d. per pound, the valpe of some of thetype, whieh was quite noYw, being over 4s. per pound. In this manner it appeared that several tons of valuable typo, the property of the prosecutors, had been made away with.
The prisoner was found Guilty, and sentenced to nine months' hard labour.
The REcoRDER severely reprimanded Meyes for his mi3conduct in purchasing an article of this description at suph aprice from a person like the prisoner, and he ordered that his expenses should not be-allowed.

BELLUOUSE AND AiOTHRM V. T CORPORATION OF
MANCHXSTR
Mr. Atherton, Q.O., Mr. Manisty, and !&. Wheeler appesred for the plaintiffs; Sir Fitzroy Kelly (specially retained), Mr. Hlugh Hill, Q.C., Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. lonok, for the defendants.
The action was brought to recover compensation for iIjury sustained by the plaintiffs by the defendants divert. ing the river Medlock, by means of which the water flowed mto the plaintiffs' mill, and damaged it and the goods in process of manufaoture. The plaintiffs, Mr. James Bellhouse and Mr. Wainwright Bellbouse, are spinners of cotton yarn, carrying on business in Manchester. Their premises are situate on the river Medlock, and consist of two miUs, known as the old mill and the new milL The old mill was erected in 1806 by Mr. David Bellhonset the plaintiffs' father, but he did not enter into oocupationof it until 1819 ithaving been let to a succession of tenants in the interim. fn 1836 he huilt the new mill, and his sons, the plaintiffs, who had previously become his partners, continued in occapation of both millg up to the present time. The mills are situated upon the south, or Chorlton-upon-Medlock side of the stream, and were for 20 years or more divided 'from the river by a wall of considerable height, which until the 9th of lastAnugst, whenthecircamatauceout of whichthepresent action arose occurred, wa found to he a sufficient protction against any incursion ofithe water. On that.occasion there was a considerable downfall-of ziin. The strdam of the Medlock became very much swollen, 'And owing to certiin works constrcted by the defendants, the corp6ration of Manchester, itsoourse, matheplaintiffs alleged,wanob6tructed and the consequence was that the water rose as-nuch as 29 inches above the top of the wall, got on to the ground floors of the mills, and did o6nsiderable dimage. In 1854 the defendants commenced the construction of the work in question, and up to tha' time no serious overflow of the river causing any great damage had taken place. Occasionally the water rose to the level of the flooring, and; getting into the ashpits, put out the fires by which the engine was worked. When, however, the corporation work wasz on. structed, and which consisted of a tunnel, this state of things was completl altered. The overflows were greater and more frequent, and the attention of the corporation was called to the circumstance by some millowners *hile the tunnel was in course of construction. Some alteration was in consequence made in it, but stiU in its construction the course of the stresm was not preserved, but was thrown more to the north than it originally ran. It also did not join another tunnel on an even surface, which for the free flow of water it was necessarythat it should do, and the consequence was that this error in construction also caused great obstruction to thu stream. When the flood in August last occurred this obstruction was most felt. The water rose 3 feet 7 inches above the crown of the arch of the tunnel, and rising also 22 inches over the wall which protected the premises from the mill flooded the plaint's m asweUlasthose of other partieswhichwere adoining It rose to 3 feet 4 inches on the floor of the new
inill, and to4 feet 1 inch on the floor of the old mill; and it did not subside until some time the following day th 10th of Augulst. All the property, consisting of expensv
carding enginos, yarn, &c., was seriouly damaged, and the present acion was brought to recover compensation for th iniury so sustained.
Various witnesses were called in support of these facts;*
among others two civil engineers, who gave it as their opi- - nion at the obstruction presented by the tunnel caused the overflow which damaged the plaintiffis' premises.
For the defence it Was admitted that 'the tunnel constructed by the corporation had to a certain extent thrown back and confined the water, but it was contended at the same time that even if there was no tunnel in existence at al the flood in question would have risen seven inobes over the wall which protected the plaintiff's premises from the river, and would lave oasionedalmostasmuchiniurashad been caused by the overflow complained of. It exceeded in volume and destructiveness the flood which in 1853 visited Manchester, and which was a very violentone ; and though an overflow sufficient to flood the mill would have taken place even if the tunnel had not been constructed, still the defendants were willing to py whatever prortion of the damage the jury might think them liable for.e
A grest deal of evidence was then tendered upon the part o the defendants, and this morning Sir Fitzroy KeUly being about to address the jury, they at once intimated that their minds were mnade up, and, after being warned by Mr. Justice Crompton that they coutd only give as damages the amount Of the injury which had arisen from the overflowing of the corporation tunnel, they rehtured a verdict for the plain. tiffs-Damages, 4,5001.

Mr. W. HL Cooke appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Powell defendod tho prisoner.
It appeared that on the 27th of February, 1854, the prisoner was married to Eliza Tandy, at the church of uUiting Power. He lived with her for some time, and so late as Christmas, 1855, he was living with a person as his wife, and who his Lordship decided must be presumed to be so. On the 26th of Marh, 18I6, the prisoner was married at St. John's Church,: Glocester, to B. IL Wilhams, a chambermaid at the Royal Hotel,-he being the boots there. According toher evidence, theprisoner
always represented hiamself as a married man, and when1 he was marred to the prosecutrix he stated he was I a bachelor, and he was so described in the register. On her crosg-examination it appeared that three months after her marriage she gave birth to a ebild, the fruits of antenuetial intercourse with the prisoner.

Mr. Justice Wlt s said the prisoner had not only donean injury to the pros6eutrix, but he had profaned a relgious xervice, and for the offence he must be imprisoned, with hard labour, for four calendar months.

Stubbins, and J. E dwards, with X riot at Cheltenham, on the 20th of November, 1856, and ausaultin,g WDIiaU1 BoodlO, a solicitor in that town.
Mr. Serjeant Pigott,f Mr. Powell, and Mr. Falon a
peared for the prosecution; 3fr. Reatingr, QC., and 1r. Jdnner defended Shirer - tr. Wh%teley,Q.C., and Mr. W H. Cooke defended Wlllianis. Mr C-oom also defended Ellis, Edwards, Edmond%, iAAdis, Oldshidp, Griffi, and Clarke; Mr. I'Gachen defended Bick; Mr. G. S. Griffiths defended Smith and Bacldand,and Mr.H.y Iloyd defended Walton and Stabbins.
Mr. Serjeant PiGoTo, in opening the case, said this was an indictment preferred by William Boodle against theprixoners in the dock for a riot and assault alleged to have been committed on the 20th of November -in the last year. On that day there was an election for Town Improvement Commissioners at Cheltenham, which was hotly contested. The'
rosecutor had been engaged during the day in the middle wSard, and shortly beforo, 4 o'clock he went in a cab to the pollng booth of the North Ward to tender his vote. A large crowd was assembled, and as he was endeavouring to make his way through he was stopped by Edwards, a man who had been a prizefighter. The defendant Shirer, who was a mercer, called out to Edwards to keep him back, upon which Edwards thrust his elbow in 'his neck, while another to-e his coat, and another knocked his hat off. Somebody trampled on his feet, and did him considerable injury, and but for the assistance of the police, Who came udp, he might have been trampled to death. The learned Serjeant sad it was of the utmost importance that riotous proceedings at elections should be put a stop to, for tbey not orily had the effect of intimidating voters, and preventing them from voting, but they sometimes led to the infliction of serious injunes, as had recently happened at Kidderminster.
The following witnesses were then called*-
Willamoode, exAminedbhyMr. PowXLn, said,-Iamuno w- an attorney atCheltenham, adrmitted after the last examination in London. On the 20th of November I was clerk to Mr. Packwood, a solicitor. On that day there was an election of town commissionera. I was engaged during the day in the booth of the M£iddle Ward. There was a contest' in the North Ward at a distance of a quarter of a mile. There were four candidates there. I had a vote in the Worth Ward. There were two to be returned. The candidates were Marshall, Downing, Hollis, and Eale., At the close of the day I went from the MiddleWard to the North' Ward in a cab. 'A sbop was made into a pollinUg plce As I aproached the crowd I heard a vbice cry out, '-'Here beis. Keep him out." I had to go through the crowd round a barricade. Iwas going into the booth and the mob elosed round me. After swa7ing about, I met -Shirer and Edwards. Shirer is brother-m-law of Marshall one of the candidates. I was for T'owning and Hollis. Edwards-put himself in'a fightin'g podtion, and said, "You don't come in here, Master EoodleX I said Ishould. lesaid, 4-YoM shan't, you have voted, once this morning." I said I had not, I had not been once in the-North Ward that morning. 1iirer said, " Keep him back, Jem," and Edar-ds pt his elbow inmythroatand pushedmeback onthemob.andsome'body tore my eoat tail across. 'Some one else knockedm* hat off. Ieaughtholdof-Edwards'sarm whichwasbmnythroat, and foreed him from my throat. Shirer was all this time shoulder to shoulder with Edwards. As I ws getting Edwards's arm from my throat I saw a man named Howae, and he got hold of the railings with one hand and of me with the other. Edwards made another grab at me and caught me by the groin on the right hand side. I haildoed out for the police, and told them to tke him into custody, as he had committed a gross assault nupon me. Edwards grabbed at a roll of papers which I h d in my pock-et. jiowso held me by the railings till the police came up. When I tried to get away from Edwards Shirer pushed rme back. One policeman came and held the arm Howe had, and twopolicemen came and held my other arm - and by their united exertions' I Vas dragged within the avenue into the booth. The moment I got in Ifound I was very lamer either from being tranpl4d -n ortwisted. When I got mn I gave my votes Ithen went out the other way to the carriage, and returned W the Middle Ward. There were several hundred people collected at the booth in the north ward. They were condu6iting themselves in a riotous manner. There was no disturb4noe at the Middle Ward. When I was treated in this way I was alarmed. One of the sinews of my leg got rupturedL. I could not walk till the second week in January. 1-do 'not
seak to any one of the defendants except Shirer and Edwards.
Cross-examined by 3fr. WHsTrsy.-I have had a good deal to do with elections. I recollect an election for coroner a few years ago. I was for Septimus Pruen. I do not recollect that I one night manufactured 200 votes. (Laughter.) I was secretary to an institution. I did no' manufacture 160 freehold votes for 6d. a-vote. I was advised by four lawyers that if the institution was conveyed to the memahers they would all have good votes. I don't know they paid 6d. a-piece. Their shares were one guinea each, and they were to pay 6d. every week. I took them to the polL, and they took the freeholders' oath. Before I was an articled clerk I was an auctioneer for three years. I was then clerk in the Cheltenham PoEstoffice. Before that I was a currier. (Laughter.) I was also a firewood mercbant. That was why I was called "blazes." (Laughter.) I also made blac:kng for my leather when I was a currier. The witness of his own accord added, "Now Iam admitted bythree judges to be anattorney of the superior courts.'7 I was not apatentee of a crinoline petticoat. (Iaughter.) On the 20th of November I dined at the Queen's Hotel. The next day I went to the scrutiny. Some 20 years ago I got into several rows; one was with Craddock on a racecourse; another was with Partridge abouta horse named Tommy. Idid not fight them.
Cross-examined by Mr. KRlTfl.O.-This was at a quarter to 4. The numbers are generally shown at the committeeroom, not at the booth. When I got out of the cab I got out by the barricade into the crowd. I did not use my elbows. I tried to get through' the crowd. I had no friends there. None cried "Boodle for ever P" (Laughter.) The crowd swayed me backwards and forwards. They tried to keep me back; and Shirer Eald "Keep him back, Jem," in a loud voice. I told the policeman Bowloles to take Ed*ards in charge for assaulting me. He said he could do nothing in such a crowd. I preferred a bill against the defendants at the last winter
Crom-examined by Mr. CoonE.-I wrote handbills, and gave directons for their being printed. These are the bills. They wvere in auswer to others put out by Mfr. Marshall. I did not agree with 31r. Marshall that neithler of us should vote. I have always taken an active part in elections.
Cross-examined by MIr. LLOYD.-At Cheltenham some magistrate sits daily.
Several witnesses were called to corroborate the evidence given by the prosecutor, but from their evidenoe it did not appear that the alleged riotwasanything more than an'ordinary election squeeze. At the close of the evidence for the prosecution,
His LoRDSHIr decided that there was no case against 10 of the defendants, and they were at onceo dis-
charged.B 3Lordship, however,said the case of Shirer,
Edwards, Buckland, and Smith must go to the jury.
Mr. K nnsT then addressed the jury for Shirer, and in so doing condemned In strong terms the conduct of the prosecutor in perveriing the forms of criminal justioe to the advancement of his political interests He ahould call witnesses to prove that there was no riot and ssault, but that an1y inconvenience which the prosecutor might have sustained arose entirely fromi his owFn fault in attempting to force his wray through the crowvd to the polling booth in a
rough and violent manner. The prosecutor might any day havo gone before a magistrate at Cheltenham and made the charge, but, insteadlof so doing, he went before the vrand jury at the last winter assizes and got the indictment lound wthout the defendants being made aware wlhat evidence was to be brought against them. That showed the animus of the prosecutor, and that he was acting in the m=ater with the spirt of a partian.
Mr. SKsNxnI then addressed the jury for Edwards, and Mr. GRunrs for Smith and Buckland
Several witnesses were examined on the part of the defendantr, but,, although they proved that they did'
not see any asault committed on the prosecutor, I the evidence went to show that there 'was a great deal of disturbance when the prosecutor arnvedat the booth which induced the offfcer on duty to send for an additional force. They also confirmed the statement that there were cries to prevent the prosecutor from going into the booth, and that a number of persons pushed against him for that purpose. In the course of the evidence itta)i. peared that Smith had been in eustody since December, and mii consequence of that fact the counsel for the prosecution consented to his acquittal.
Mr. Jutice Wna.s very carefully summed up the evidence as it affected the other three defendants but ulti-
The jnv found them all Niot Guivy.
The trial was not concluded till half-paSt 10 o'clock.

joint liability of- the master- and owners. 'The -owrners' -snffered judgment to go by default,' and the- only, question - now was whether - the master -ould be b held personally liable. It -appeared. - that, according to the sua couse f buines, te mster and owners

Mr. GRAY, on the purt of the plaintiff, conternded that this showed clearly that the credit was given to tie zimaster as well as to the owners.
Mr, DowDzswxrI, forthe defendint, contended that it only amounted to an acknowledgement of the accuracy of tbe items, and not of the master's liabllity.

General Sir Charles James Napier.*
tABERA v SXR OltARLES JTAMES NAPIER.*
Sir Charles Napier was a very distinguished General, and Sir William Napier is a very able historian. Nevertheless, the career of the former can scarcely be said to merit a record extending over 2,000 pages, and divided into a score of ' epochs" and innum-erable "periods," as if he 'were a sort of Hindoo god, every act of his life an avatar, or a geological phenomenon, illustrating the doctrine of transmigration as he passed from the crustaceous phase of existence to the saurian epoch, and from the epoch of the sauTiaus to the epoch of the mnammoths and Oriental monsters -and the pen of the historian, in attempting a memorial of such mnag-- nitude, has preduced a work chiefly remarkable for combiningallthefaultswvhicd. abiographercapossibly commit. It is tedious ; it is bombastic; it is cumiously disjointed i it is oat of aU proprtion to the event; collective and single; it abouDds with irrelevancies; it is full of tlte mose extravagaut lattery of the hero, and of all his frieads and relatives to the tenth degree; it is fiull of the most extravagaut censure ,of all his foes, or of all who by any chance were ignorant of t.he greatness of the Napiers; and from first to last it is written withotit one ray of that small but necessary faculty which knows how to separate the rMidilous from the sublime.
It cannot have escaped the notice of the raost cursory observer that of late years history has been growing more and more biographical in its tendency, while biography has been growing more and more historical i its tone. In the picturesque pages of Macaulay, as in that darker scroll on which Carlyle writes his terrible "MeIene, mene, tekel upharsin,"-two extremely opposite types of history,-it is impossible not to remark how frequently the interest of the narrative is centred in cabinet pictures of personal traits, ilustrative manners, and accidental customs. Vn the other hand, we have learned to magnify so much the importance of individuals that there is scarcely a memoir published now-a-days in which the subject is not regarded as of national interest. If he voted at a county election, he is supposed to have powerfully assisted in carrying the Reform Bill-hence a chapter on rotten boroughs and corruption generally; if he doffed his hat in the streets to George IV., he is supposed to have had a powerful influence in checking rebellion-hence an edifying dissertation on the balance of the three estates. Now, while by a process of this kind history lias been very much bettered, it is by no means clear that biography has been equally benefited; it is not apparent that we have at all improved on the models furnished by Boswell, by Southey, or by Lockhart. We are not disposed to underrate the importance of individuals, but really in this world of ours there are differences of degree which ought to be observed, and it is the height of absurdity. because the action of every unit of a nation or a party tells upon the total result, to insist on tracing that action througbout all its ramifications-just as if, because philosophers declare that every word we utter, every breath we breathe, has, through a million of intermediate links in the chain Of cause and effect, a definite influence on the dancing of the leaves in an American forest or on the course of a hurricane in the Indian seas, it would be worth our while to trace to tbe last infinitesimal result the progress of every breath that we exhale. But to a labour of this kind biography is tending more and more in every department, although most glariDgly in those religious memoirs which are at present, in consequence of their number, the most important section of our biographical literature. A Dissenting grocer, who makes money and extends his operations till he is regarded as a marvel by the countryside, has his life wlitten in the most high-flown style as the pattern of a British and Christian merchant; a sickly undergraduate who never does anything, but makes up for his nothingness by writing in his diary all his good intentions, is paraded before the world as a favourable specimen of the earnest and evangelical student; and so we may go through the whole list-the good physician, and the benign apothecary, down to the lives of those poor men and women that half-a-century ago would have been published under the names of " Penitent Polly" or " Dutiful Dick" by the Religious Tract Society, in small volumes of a dozen pages, but which are now held up to our admiration as the salt that preserves us from the decay of nature-the few righteous souls that preserve us from the judgment of Heaven. Not only, however, is biography written in this exaggerated style; it is alo, and as a necessary consequence, written without the slightest regard for the patience of readers and the shortness of human life. With very great complacency biographers announce in their prefaces that they mean " to let the subject of this unpretending history speak for himself, and to stand as little as possible between him and the public." Consequently, they break open his desk, rummage among his papers, and publish every line that the poor mortal ever wrote,whether it was to the tailor who dunned him, to the mother who bore him, or to the doctor whom, in the innocence of his heart, he sometimes invited to a family dinner. Hence, not he who is the greatest man or who has performed the greatest exploits, but he who has writtw;) most, gets the longest biography; so that while the " Life of Nelson" is complete in a small pocket volume, wvhen the life of Admiral Napier comes to be written, it -will be in not less than six huge tomes, fit only for the shelves of the British Mrluseum. The principle set forth in the prefaces to which we have alluded is merely a fine way for biographers to lay claim to a merit while in reality confessing their incapacity. It is easier to transcribe two pages of a letter than to compress into two lines the substance of the letter; so the incapable biographer publishes all his departed friend's epistolary twaddle, all the nonsense uttered in his unguarded moments, -while he Lays the flattering unction to his soul that he displays high art in thus letting the poor unfortunate speak for himself. Even Sir William Napier, who is a fine testy old gentleman, with the pluck of the whole army, the prejudices of a whole party, and the pride of the whole family in his veins, is carried away by the same delusion. Sir Charles Napier was a constant correspondent, and everybody who remembers that when he was at the head of the Indian army his General Orders were the most amusing portion of the overland news-probably the most lively series of despatches and general orders that ever have been issued-will be prspared to find more pleasant matter in his private correspondence. Indeed, we must do these volumes the justice to say that they are full of the most valuable materials. Unfortunately, however, Sir William Napier is about the worst editor that could be selected for the arrangement of these papers, overpowered as he is by an inordinate opinion of his brother's great genins for war and of his own greatgenius for history. Having produced a narrative which deserves to be regarded as one of the noblest military records that have ever been penned, he applies the same style to biography, and writes of the old nurse and the aged coachman of the family barring' out robbers from their mansion as if he were describing the position of Wellington behind the lines of Torres Vedras. As for Sir Charles, was he not a Napier-was he not the firstborn ? Therefore, every incident that could possibly be remembered, even such as only fond iiaiuuas tell of their darling boys, is recaUed to his honour.
Wvnat a marvellous soldier ! what a Heaven-born statesman !-what a fund of humour, equal to that of Rabelais or Swift ! Hence, every line that he wrote is worthy of preservation ; in every quarrel-and he was continually quarrellinghe is always in the right. When he thought the passing clouil very likea'whale, no one dared to think it like a weasel, or backed a s a camel, without beino either a fool or a knave, and wrorthy of eternaI infamy. This party spirit is carried to such an extreme that at last we begin to suspect every statement with regard to persons in the vol me or out of the volume that has ever been endorsed with the signature of a Napier. Far be it from us to say one word against the just fame of that great though unfortunate General, Sir John Moore; yet we are tempted to sa;y that the justice which has at last been acc,rded to his memory, and chiefly through tibe briUiant defence of the present author, in his
itidtrJ of t1te Peuivs7mdar Har, seems very much to have depended on the accident,-which the volumes before us reveal-that he was the earliest and most steady friend of the youthful Napiers.
Beyond all doubt Sir Charles Napier was a hero; 'but he was a hero of the Achilles type,-the strong,
brave, impracticable man,-full of the most generous impules and of the most bitter animosities. Modern readers are not prepossessed with the Homeric heroes; but Achilles, after all, was a noble
H T i2 Lfe and Opinions of Gcen'ali Sr Charles James lapiniefl , C. . By Lieuten;ant-General Sir W. Napier, UX(Jt vw. I. 2m4II, LQIda; Mfurray,
fellow. He co-uld brook no superior, he had prodigious powers:, of sulking, he used very hard words, and woe t(t those who incurred his wrath ; but he had his genial side also,-he notonly softened to the sex, hre was most passionate in his friendship; fond ot mnusic, ho played on the lyre; and thlere is an ixexpressible tenderness shed over his whole charastr by that attachment to his mother w-hich led hima in all his troubles to wander on the shore and call on her to come to hin from amonLg the nymphs of the ocean. Such was Sir Charles Napier to the -life. His devotion to his Thetis so long as she lived was very beautiful, and that series of letters to his " dearest mother," " precious mother, " blessed mother," " beloved mother," "dear old lady," is in fine contrast with the usu&lly rougher aspects of the man. As for friendship, he clung to his friends with ardent affection, and there is scarcely a page of these memoirs which does not give evidence of the most self-denying devotion to his brothers in arms and brothers in blood. It is unnecessary to say, with regard to women, 'that, soiaierlike, he was continuaUy in love; the consequence in his case was that he never married biRl he was near 5o, and then he married twice in rapid succession. Bat, to complete the resemblance to the ancient warrior with his harp, it mast be added that Sir Charles also oultivated the arts, and had his ambition as an author,-yea, even as a novelist. On the other hand, In his more public capacity, our modern hero was very much out of his element. He was born too late. Had he lived not in these days when. an army depends on its discipline and is like the cloud " which moveth altogether if it move at all," but in those earlier times when victory depended more on the personal prowess of individual knights, he would have achieved a name like that of Achilles, or of Lancelot, or of Tancred, as one of the greatest warriors, without whose help, whoever might be commander-in-chief, Agamemnon, or Arthur, or Godfrey, no army could be successful in the field. As it was, Sir Charles Napier had not the faculty of working in concert with other men-especially if they were a little formal and commonplace, and were above him; and, unfortunately for him, there are no longer Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire, which singlehanded he might prick forth to encounter. Alas for these degenerate days I the only dragons that crossed his path were such as Old Pivot (Sir David Dundas)-" I would like to roast old Pivot;"" false and foolish" old Adam, who had the " knack of using the wrong end of the wedge ;" Goody Goderich (Lord Ripon); Macaulay; Outram; that "barbarian," Lord Dalhousie; the Whigs, who are "all that is infamous and stupid in politics, all that is contewptible and incapable in governing ;" and he drives at them as if they were the veritable beasts of fable. " The Lord deliver me from a colleague ! " he wrote on one occasion; and at another period he exclaimed with needless profanity, when, however, he had some grounds for his vexation, " Jesus of Nazareth ! what an idiot the military man is who takes advice !" He then uttered the elegant prayer, " When I take adv5ce again may I split like a camel I " He could not endure opposition, and, indeed, frankly confessed that he did not like those who differed in opinion from him-" My temper won't bear it." lte never overlooked or despised an opponent. " That doctrine of despising I hold very cheap; meet every man with his own weapons is my creed." Accordingly, there is an air of vigorous dogmatism about all his assertions. He explodes with an oath or two, ancd having thus shelled his adversary into silence he carries everything before him at the point of the bayonet. If there is any opposition, woe to the wretch I One can trace the gradual rise of this peculiar temner, this impatience of control, even in his school days, in an incident which Sir William Napier has decribed in fine language to the eternal honour of the boy. He was beaten by his schoolmaster-unjustly, his biographer says; but, asheis always treated unjustly, there may be some room for doubt as to the fact. However, there is no doubt as to the result of the castigation. He retired into a dark closet and sulkea for hours, not recovering his good humour for a week. At a later period his resentment was much more lasting. With a frankness which is one of the most charming attributes of the man he writes in his journal-and it is pretty evident that his journal, especially when he means to puff his brothers, was intended for public inspection,-" We Napiers are all a hot, violent crew; but it is only for a moment. Neither George, nor Richard, nor Henry are the least revengeful. William and myself are; but"-and how delightful is the unaffected simplicity of the exception-" William and myself are; but only where resistance continues." Such a hero might do very well in the Iliad, and we commend the conqueror of Scinde to those of our epic poets who complain that the heroic is vanished from the earth. But it must be confessed that, with all his great power, and spite of all the great deeds which in the face of opposition he actually accomplished, he was sadly out of his sphere in the present century. It is certainly not in accordance with our modern sense of dignity to find that, when Mr. Macaulay refused travelling expenses to our Achilles, that gallant warrior, at the head of his troops in the north of Eng-land, among other modes of expressing his iutense disgust, made the following entry in his journal :-" September 1st, 1840.-Untoward day for partridges. Were Mr. Secretary Macaulay one, I would turn sportsman." Yet peace be to his memory ! with all his faults he had a noble heart, and he was a great captain,-among those trained in the school of M,oore and Wellington none greater; and, however his bearing to authorities at home may be open to criticism, none of us has to blush for his attitude to the enemies of our country. Ever honest in his thoughts, ever bold in his assertions, he was as incorruptible as the bronze of his statue in Trafalgar-square, and a rock of defence as firm as the granite of its base. How far that colossal statue may be regarded as a faithful portrait we are not prepared to say, but in some respects the present volume imparts a very different idea of the hero, who rises before us not with a sculpturesque calm, but with an eager, restless, jerkiing manner ; not of broad-shouldered, gisantic proportions, but rather stunted of growth, slight of form, and low of stature (be was scarcely 5i feet); with eyes dark and lustrous, it is true, but afflicted with distressing weakness, so that he had continually to use spectacles; with long flowing hair; and with a nose which was decidedly the most prominent feature of his countenance-so prominent that during the campaign in Scinde, when the Ameers fancied he was in their power, it was determined to butcher every man, woman, and child of the British force with the single exception of Sir Charles Napier, and forhim the following destiny wvas devised. His nose was to be bored, a ring placed in it, and a chain attached to the ring; Nusseer JIhan was then to mount his horse and by the chain lead the British commander in triumph from the field. The ingenuity and sense of humour displayed in this scheme were absolutely the sole redeeming2 qualities of these miserable Aineers.
" I have never seen his equal,"was Sir C. Napier's opinion of his father, an opinion which he also entertained with regard to his mother, and indeed almost every member of his family; for, as a specimen of the height to which he carried this feeling, he declared in the Scinde campaign that he vaui-ed -h
approval of the great Duke and of his own brother above all others. Whenthe admiring son, however, in another part of hs Journal, gives us a more
definite notion of his father's unequalled power by
sayingHo, w small others appear when I think of
h; he was too great, too majestic for small command," w-e are reminded of the brilliant results of military teaching at HighWycombe, as illustrated in one of the students who was asked by Sir John Mloore at Shormcliffe to move his brigade, and who magnifioently replied that he had never been taught to move less than 100,000 men. A better idea
of old Napier wil be derived from the words of Lord
Fife, as reported by Sit Charles himself:-" Poor
dear Napier, blast him ! hp liked dried codfish; rll send him isoie in a frauLE." We learn, however, to set a higher value o r the abstemious habits of the
I old man when we read in his epitaph that, being
made Controller of A -iy' 'Accouuts in Ireland, h, recovered several imilli6ns'o monmey for the publlc
treasury, his very fint act being the, abolition of all fees, by which of hisrownfree' will he cut down his
talary front 20,0001. to' 6001. a-year. He, tob,Ihike his son, was esteemed an " impracticable' man, but
it must be remembered that this epithet ii not necessarily one of blame; it implies praise or'hlame cecording to the character o ; the eman by Whom it is adopted ;. and, in those co xrupt times, the controller who was content to dr;w the thirtieth part of hi s salary might, to his very great honour, be regarded as impracticable, bcan.e he would not consent "to make thipgs plea atut' to, apackof rapa.
cious olleagues. His lecond tile, thL mLg> 'er of the
General, was of a very different stamp. She mus,t hve" been an extraordinary woman, although these volumes give no definite idea of her character and of her intluence, so that she moves throughout the biography rather as a spiritual presence than as palpable flesh and blood. She was a daughter of the ducal house of Lennox. Her father, the second Duke of Richmond, and grandson of Ckarles II. by Louisa de Querouaille, the celebrated Duchess of Portsmouth, was betrothed when a -noy to the Lady Sarah Cadogan to cancel a gambling debt between the parents. "Slrely, you Are not going to marry me to that dowvdy I s7id the young fellow, then Lord March, when the knot was about to be tied. The knot was tied however, and immediately the youthful bridegroom was hurried away from his dowdy bride to the Continent. Three years afterwards, on returnig from his travels, Lord March went straight to the theatre and saw a lady with whose appearance he was fascinated. "Why, that is the reigning toast-that is Lady March," he was told. It was his dowdy wife. The next moment he claimed her, and they lived so happily together that years afterwards we find them cooing to each other most affectionately at a ball described in one of the letters of Horace Walpole. "The ball began at 8 o'clock. The beauties were the Dukeof Richmond's two daughters and their mother, still handsomer thanthey. The Duke sat byhis wife all sight, kissing her hand." Theissue of t'nis marriage was, among other children, three daughters-two of them the beauties of the ball, and the third born very much later. The eldest of these, Lady Caro]ine Lennox, was the mother of Charles James
ox; the second, Lady Emily, was the mother of the unfortunate Lord Edward Fitzgerald; and the youngest, Lady Sarah, was the mother of these gallant apiers. The story goes that when Lady Sarah was scarcely 18 George 111. offered her his hand and was refused; he persisted in his offer, and was at length accepted; but when he had so far succeeded the Monarch finally jilted her, and took unto himself another wifo. As the Georges, amid all their excellent qualities, were never remarkable for a refined sense of the beautiful, the King's admiration cannot be regarded as a deci'ive proof Of the lady's worth; but the incident, which Sir William Napier has related very curtly, is significant as the key to what the biographer takes every oppor tunity of Indicating in the most mysterious terms" a blight from the highest quarters," which pursued the Napiers, father and sons, while George III. or any of his sonawere alive. We could have wished that it this matter Sir William had either preserved a dignified silence or had been a little more explicit. The present volumes do not inform us at what date the lady who had at first refused and was at last forsaken by the British Monarch was wedded to one of the officers of his Guards; but as Lady Sarah Lennox was scarcely 18 when she had this encounter with Royalty, and as she was double that age when her eldest son, the subject of the present biography, was born, it is probable that 4n interval had elapsed quite sufficient to enable even a more amorous swain than the RPoyal George to think with equanimity oEhis lost fair one, wedded to a more fortunate individual-the Honourable George. Yet it is insinuated throughout these volumes that the slowness of Charles Napier's promotion in the army and his want of Court favour were due to this unhappy occurrence, which rendered "his very existence an offence to Royal pride." Sir Williamn Napier we are very sure picked up that idea from his mother; it is a woman's idea. The vain beauty of 18 fancies 20 years afterwards that the impression she made in her bloom on susceptible hearts iS stiUl indelible, and the birth of a son, to her so important, she fancies to be of equal importance to the fat old stagers who ran after her in their green and salad days. The suggestion of our biographer seems to be that great George our King, who deceived one of his subjects with whom he was madly in love, objected to her marrying ever afterwvards, pursued her husband and her sons with hatred through life, and bequeathed that hatred as a legacy to his family. But, although the statement of the gallant General, when it comes to be sifted, deserves only such: a criticism as BMr. Burchell, with his invariable inter-. jection, would have used, we are quite ready to believe that Lady Sarah Napier was a very remark. able woman. We have already intimated that the present volumes afford us no idea of what she was. Evidently, however, she was loved by her son Charles, as even mothers very seldom are, and'he knew well how to flatter the old lady's vanity. " Rochefoucult says a man has no comfort so great as finding others suffer moro than himself. He is right," says Sir Charles to his mother, then 70 years of age; "it is the greatest satisfaction to me that the &egent is 50 and that I am only 34. But you are the most provoking woman alive. You tell me that you have been iU in a copperplate hand, and of your being better in a scrawl like mud, where a hundred chickens have been walking." Read in the light of that Royal controversy to which we have referred, what superb self-conceit and what adroit flattery i that offhand comparison of the eldest son of Queen Charlotte and the eldest son of Lady Sarah, who was not a little proud of her supposed grievance. The conceit of this passage is worth comparing with another titbit in a letter addressed 15 years before to his mother, in which he 'preten is to be disgusted with the Prince of Wales "for taking the liberty of calling me Charles! Marry. come up, my dirty cousin 1"
The family of this noble matron, who lived to the age of 81, consisted of five sons and four daughters. Of these Charles was the eldest. Then came George. "He was a bolder rider than I was," says Charles, "and when his blood was up all the devils in hell would not stop him in a hunt or a battle." As he grew older, however, it seems to have been rather difficult to get up his blood. Twice he lost his opportunity; once, when before the battle of Novara the command of the Sardinian army was offered him by the King,
"he would not make war except for his own. country; " and again, when after tne battle of Chillianwallah he refused the command of the Indian army-" thinking that the post belonged of right and of policy to his brother Charles." Surely, this is a very inadequate reason, since he could scarcely be assured that in the event of bis refusal the appointment would fal to his elder brother. These offers, however, show the estimation in which he was held, and he seems to have been the best liked of all the Napiers. Next in age comes William, the historian, and the present biographer, whose career is too well known to call for remark. After him is Richard, who took high honours at Oxford the year after Sir Robert Peel, but seems to have had no settled pursuit. Henry, the youngest son, entered the navy, and, after having seen some service, and in a smaU way given an example to " Black Charles," the Admiral, how to conduct a squabble with the Admiralty, retired into private life, and, like his brother William, sought for literary honours as the author of a History of Florence, which lays claim to. be " the only complete story of the wonderful existence of that wonderful State," as Sir William says in his most pulfing style. Of four sisters twvo died young.
The subject of the present biography was born at Whitehall on the 10th of August, 1782, and, as Achilles was dipped in the Styx, Charles Napier seema almost to have been dipped inathe Thames,
for, as he says, " I partake of the quality of the water-never good until fermented; then, when all other water becomes bad, it freshens from contrariness." In the incidents of his childhood there is nothing very remarkable, and the only circumstance that seemns worthy of record is his first appearance in public, which his brother relates with the most imperturbable gravity of style, and which is chiefly memorable as being the unfulfilled programme of his life. One of those half-naked showmen who excel in athletic feats was displaying his peculiar powers to a crowd of peopte near the residence of the Napiers, at that time in Ireland. Balancing a ladder on his chin he ordered a young sweep to mount it. Young sweepdeclined, and at this moment Charles Napier, a little fellow in petticoats, age six years, was asked by his father
to mount. WYithout more ado he asceuded the. ladder, to the great satisfactioA of the spectators. The feat was so sucoessful that all his life. afterwarls Charles Napier was trying to mount his ladder on people's chins, and. the comparative failure-of his career must be attributed to his continual endeavours to fix his ladder on that perilous po%ition. There never was a man who by hifs own account was more unfortunate in his superiors. Sir John Mloore and Lord Ellenborough indeed are exceptions. The* former, in consequence of private connexions, showed considerable partiality to Napier, who, moreover, was not long enough under his CtOlntrol. to exhibit symptoms of waywfardnes. The latter followed Napier's advice, turned up hhi c.hir and all9wFed Sir Charles to place the ianfidi ox PDIt; heter
in the view of all the Napiers he is a god. But whst words are too harsh to describe those " envious superiors," as Sir William Napier calls them, who refused or neglected to do the bidding of his brother? Why, Captain C. Napier won the battle of Corunna, and if somebody elae had only done his duty the army of Soult would have been completely destroyed. He i# alwrays in the right, his "t envious superior' always in the wrong) incontestably proving by his conduct that his subordinate officer ought to be raised high above him. Charles Napier, indeed, shows so little power of amalgamation with other men, sc little capacity even to comprehend his own position, thatto us it seems as if he could have made a greater name in any other career than that of war. Bloodthirsty ruffian as many people imagine him to have been, he hated war with his whole soul ; he fauciedbiimself a great legislator, and he_proved that he might have been a great preacher. lt would seem almost as if it had been determined by a mere accident whether he zhould be an irascible old general, his mouth full of oaths and his hand flourishing the sword, or a hotheaded but venerable missionary, his mouth fulU of anathemas while he thumps the Bible with his inPpired fist. The accident must be reiated in his own words *-" When a boy at Limerick a rascal half persuaded me to be a Methodist; but he seduced his maid; she seduced me and so betrayed the secrets of his principles. 1 remember nothing good but the pigs and the gloves, and not-hing pleaant but the
omen, who were quite delightful, and as wicked as they were pretty."
Charles Napier was a boy of 12 when he entered the army. While thus early, however, he assumed the habits of the soldier, he still combinea with these the life of a achoolboy, and he had the advantage of living continually either in the house of his father or with friends who treated him as their child. These early days, if they furnished him with no great experience in the art of war, at all events afforded considerable excitement, for these were the days of Irish rebellion, of Whiteboys and Ribandmen, of Emmet and Fitzgerald; and the lzapiers, while serving in the army and sworn to defend the King, yet were Whigs in feeling, had a personal grudge against the Sovereign, and a personal affection for at {east one of the Irish insurgents, so that they were in the very thick of the conflict. It was rather policeman's than a soldier's duty, however, that Charles Napier learned in these marchings to and fro, the principal weapon being a gibbet in one of the streets of Dublin, which was in such constant requisition that it remained there from day to day guarded by sentries. But the young soldier, in exchanging from one regiment to another, and passing from barracks to barracks, was thinking more of pleasure than of duty, of dancing than of drill, of the Irish girls than of the Irish rebels. His heart at this time was made of exceedingly combustible materials; it was phosphorus, that ignited of its own accord at the bare idea of that dear Miss Masy with her pretty Irish eyes saying to him-"Pig, will you marry me?" and coming to him in the dusk with Miss Vaudeleur, both wrapt up in men's greatcats. When he crossed the Channel he seems to have forgotten these Irish heauties, for he fell in love with "four misses at once," and would have danced wyith them all at the sine time, but couldn't, and so went home to think -" with his head in the grate"-of that lovely Miss Gage. He only escaped fom these syrens by going 1o see his sister and aunt in London, and plunging nto the dissipation of that very aluring metropolis. Soon, however, he learned to respond to the re-mark of one of his friends-"' Yoa know it is the devil to be made a fag for our sisters ;" and we find no more mention of his devotions until some years afterwards, in consequence of the united charms of Miss Trowbridge and Mrs. Barwell, he says, "The devil himself is not more fl1ming than myself. I go about aU fire ;" till at last, when he finds " a Miss Home, a dear little Scotch thing," we ara distressed to learn that his heart is reduced to the con| dition of a cinder. He survived, however, to have
the cinder stolen from him by an angel with the appropiate name of Miss Rob. How he recovered it nobodyknows ; but on the next pagewe find him in full chase after a very pretty widow of name unknown. "Now, never to marry any but a wiidow has been a vow of mine, and here is one to my hand! She is a prettything as a man could wish to see, and a widow I am bent on." Many years afterwards he fulfilled that vow in both his marriages, but how he fared with this particular lady we are left to infer from the fact that she closes the series of his early loves, the only subsequent symptoms of the kind which are recorded being revealed a few years afterwards during the Peninsular war, when he is seen prowling about the house of an Italian cgentleman, age 70, who, in addition to a beautiful Spanish wife, indulged in the luxury of two Opera girls, and who was so vigilant of Charles Napier, that, although the old knave gave him permission to make love to all three if he liked, he very soon sounded a retreat. In the days of his idleness, however, before he had been called to active service, all his love-making, dancing, and dissipation had a rather awkward effect upon him. He was liable to ts of profound melancholy, he wanted to destroy himself with laudanum, illness came that 'wasted him to a skeleton, and by turns he passed with feverish rapidity from one extreme of feeling to the other, from the lisping sentimentality of thebalhroom tothefoamingfuryof the madhouse. In his balroom vein ho writes,-" To me military life is like dancing up a long room with a mirror at the end, against which we cut our laces, and so the deception ends." It is only a f ew days before that he gives indications of a very different mood, in a letter apparently written to his mother--" Last night I sat up till 2 o'clock, wcritinq on the old subjett of grievances, and lashing myself into a fury wi everythizg. Abusing the army, pulling off my breeches, cursing creditors, and putting out the candle, all in a minute, I jumped nto bed, and lay there blaspheming, praying, and perspiring for two hours, when sleep came." What could have been "the old subject of grievances" at lhe early age of 21? We are left to conjecture that it was the wrongs of his mother and of her family inflicted by the Royal George; and as in lack of positive information there is no other conceivable grievance, we may, from the disclosure of such private violence on the part of Charles Napier, infer how he was likely to act in public, and comprehend how he should very naturally incur the disfavour of the Court. For he was at this period (1803) on the London Staff, living in constant intercourse with the Foxes, and probably, after his wont, flavouring the political opposition of a Whig with the personal enmity of a NaDier.
It was probably through Fox that Napier became acquainted with Sir John Moore, who was his master in the art of war. Moore, it has generally been believed, was affianced to Lady Hester Stanhope, the niece of William Pitt. In reality, his affections were set, not on the niece of Pitt, but on the niece of his great rivaL Sir William Napier, who has an awkward trick of rendering his heroes ridiculous. when he fancies that he makes them divine, iays that Sir John never offered his hand to Miss Caroline Fox, but after a hard struggle suepressed his passion, because he was afraid that his great reputation: and his high standing-" he might have added his great comeliness and winning man-
ner"-mtight overpower this young lady's judgment, so as to induce her to accept his prop ;and the gallant historian wishes us to
at in retreating from his position on such considerations he conducted himself as gloriouisly as when, a few years afterwards, he conducted the retreat of an army to Corunna. If Moore did not thus form an alliance with the Fox family, he at least became a warm friend of the Napiers. The three brothers, Charles, George, andWilliam, were under his direction at the camp at Shorncliffe, which included the 43d, the 52d, and the 95th; and Sir William Napier talks in rapturour terms of the driU and discipline established by the' ftuture hero of Coranna. These regiments, he declares, as the Light Division of the force under Wellington, proved afterwards to be the most reliable soldiers of his army in the whole of the Peninsular campaign, never once having lost any baggage except during the retreat from Salamanca, tvhen two mules were cut off. Sir William adds, in his most eulogistic style, "the separate succeesful career of the officers strikingly attests the merit of the school; so long a list of notable mea could not be presented by-three regiments of any service in the world." Whatever value may be attached to so
sweeping a statement, we are quite ready, Xon the authority of the present biographer, to give $ir John Zoore the credit of having formed the three Napiers.

Excessive Smoking.
ZXCZSSIVE SMOEIIG.
(From the LanceL)
leaving behind us the debateable ground of moderate smoking, oOnoerning which opinions of every shade and variety are entertained, we now purpowe to direct attention to somo indubitable results which follow upon exoessive indulgence in the practiceof amokiDg. Whateverdoubtg may be entertained as to the desirability of attempting to suppress the use of tobacco, there can be bat one opinion s to the abeolate necessity of warning the publie that its abue is followed by very serious consequences. It is the duty, too, of everr one who may posess any infilenoe over the habits of those within his own xphere to draw a very broad line of demarcation between the us and the abuse of tobecco. Our own sphere of in$uenoe being more extended, we feel the =oro bound to protest against excess, for opportunity and power, involve aties.
It wVould tend to very little good, however, if we were to exclam in a vue snd indefinite manner against exces, without pointing out in what exoss consists. Ejaculatory condemnation is of as little use as ejaculatory praise, and shows about as small a knowledge of what is condemned on the one hand as of what is lauded on the other. There are very few persons who will deliberately under. take to justify sensualit in genera, slthough there are mny who tenaciously adhere to their owin particular indalgence, and
Compound fcr sins they are incined to;
"By daming thooe they havemo miud to."
A somnewhat similar category of person consists of those who habitnally bewail ttieir owzn infirtaities, denouncing their extreme general sinfulness, and yet acricioniously defending every particular lapse of morality. I order to produoe any effect 'uon such persons ind%idualt, it is necessary to bo definite ard circumstantial ; and, indeed, we should address ourselves to anybody with very little effect unless we pointed out those circumstanoes of time, quantity, age, and physilc 'cal effect which cou3titute the excess against which we wish to warn our readers.
With regard to time, we hold that no one is justified in smokingearly in theday. Thatmans nernoussystemmust be in a very disordered state who resorts to a pipe or a cigar in order to tranquillize himself, and induce am aptitude for the busines of the commencing lay. The mere fact of resorting to a pipe for irch a pur,pose at once marks out a man as an exceder. The act is its own condemnation. Supposing, however, that it is done out of idleness, or a love of the narcotic effect apart from a feeling of necessity, we would ask the man who smokes early in the dry from scah motives whether he is as fit for his duties after smoling as before-whether ho is not rather depressed, languid, and inclined to doze, or-what is worse-to take an alcoholic stimulant? Whatever good effects result from a moderate use of tobscco are not required in the early part of the day. Unles a mau be the victim of pernicious habits he certainly requires neither a sedative nor a stimulant in the morning, beyond breakfast. No need can then exist for some agent to ward off or subdue the sense of muscular fatigue which follows a day's work. At this period of the 24 hours nothing is required to make the wheels of life move more ranidly or regulrly. There can be no necessity. for a drug, to ` fixthe products of nutrition," at a time when a person has just arisen from seven, eight, or nine hours' sleep and physical reparation. In short, to smoke eatly in the day means one of three thingsslavery to the habit, premeditated sensuality, or disease, and each of these signiaes excess.
Then, as to the quantity consumed. This wiU of course depend upon the kind of tobacco, and upon the idiosyncracy of the smoke.'. But, taking persons of average constitution, and suppostng the particular sample of tobacco to be neither as narcotic as " Cavendish" or a strong HLavannah, nor as inert as "1Turkish," bus moderate specimen of the plantwhat constitutes exoesa? We know of an instance in which a 'oUn3 man smoked 17 consecutive pipes; and then died with al the symptoms of poisoning by tobacco. This was undoubted excess. We know another instance in which a clergyman of the church of England smoked himself gradually into a state of fatuity. The pipe was seldom out of his mouth from morning till nigh3. But the great criterion of excess oonsists in the effect produced. Few persos, we believe, can consume more than one or two cigars daily, or smoke more than the same number of pipes per diem, without being sensibly affected either at the time or on rising the next morning. We believe that an average constitution will not bear a larger dose of tobacco than this with impunity. Anything beyond this is, in our opinion, excess, and deserves the strongest reprobation. Any good effects rshich can by any possibility ba produced by tobacco will certainly be rroducei by the allow ance we have indicated, and any indu'igence beyond this quantity will, we believe, surely and certainly inflict upon the besottedt smoker a long catalogue of physical and
Age is another of the eircumstances which require consideration in connexion with this question. When may the hablt, in moderation, be safely allowed? Certainly not before manhood - certainly not beforO the full development of the individu;d has been attained; assuredloy otDefoer
the habi s and character of the man have been formed. Whatever collateral objections may be urged against smoking, sudh asltho usual-we do hot say necessaraccompaniments of alcoholic stimnli, the habit of resorting to cigar-shops, divas &c., apply with doubls, with fearful force, toyothful smoking. We do not e, all overstate tho case when we say that huttdreds of foolish boys owe their temporal ruin to habits and associations acquited in the course of their apprenticeship to the art of smoking. The younger the smoker the more danger does he sand of suffering from these deteriorating influences. The powerful depressant requires in youth the counteorct. ing influence of the powerful excitant. The influence of immoral associations and the solicitations to and opportunities of vice which saund the youthful devotee to tobacco are hardly to be resisted by tho feeble will, the plastic temper, andthe warm 1assious of juvenescence. Tottheyoung man, and more especially to the student of medicine,in whom we are peculiarly interested, we would say-" Shun the habit of smoking as you would shun self-destruction. As you vaue your physical and moral wel
being, avoid a habit which for you can offer no advantage to compare with the dangers you incur by using it. The bright hopefulness of youth, its undaunted aspirations, and its ardent impulses require no halo of smoke through which to look-forwardupontheapproachingstragzle of life. Your manner of living must be bad indeed if you require anythiDg further than sleep, exercise, and diet to fit you for your duties as students. Your minds mnst be emasculated indeed, and arrant cowards must you be, totaUy unfit for the stern realities of what is to come, if you cannot face yonrpresent few and comparatively smiUanlxeties without having recourse to the daily use of na.rcotics." We speak from a large experience of medical students wshen we say that the intemperate smoker is theinteinperateindulger, asa general rule, ia aU that partakes of the nature of sensual gratification. It matters not that many may and do pass throngh the ordeal unscathed. Vast numbers do not. Listless minds and languid bodies, slakeleas thirst and shaking hands, ddirium tremens, madness, and death we have distinctly and surely seen to follow the unhallowed indulgence in youths who began their studies with bright promise of suocess, with fair characters, and honest purposes. It is not open to impressible and wavering youth to say thus far wil I go and no further. To commenco the downward course is too easyto retrace the false steps is too difflicult; the rikis too great, the advantage too infinitesimall small, the intsrests at stake too supremeuy important, to allow the student once to begin. It is no sign of manliness to toy with danger and sport upon the brink of a precipice. The impulse which may plunge the unreflecting boy into an abyss of ruin may com ws not when, nor with how great force; let him prove his strength by avoiding, not by courting
Let us inquire, further, whether the physiological effects produced in the course of smoking afford any indRications as to what constitultes excess. Profuse salivation cam hardly be compatible with the idea of moderation. Perpetual irritation of a mucous membrane can hardly be kept up with impunity. A large proportion of smokers mast be aware that heartburn, eructations, and apepsia surely follow one or two pipe5, or one or twocigars,beyondthe wonted allowance. The same excess is certainly followed by loss of appetite, and especially by loss of morning relish for food. Let the pulse be watched. Does it not decline in frequency below the normal standard, and is it not irregular after a very slight excess ? Do not palpitation and prm.- cordial anxiety much of tener annoy the ha bitual smoker than he would exactly like to confess ? Is not the inclination to seek the recumbent posture or to respire cold air of frequent occurrence, when the smokor would hardly like to owvi it? Do not giddiness, dimness of vision, tremors, nausea, clammy perspirations, and tinnitus aurium frequently occur in the course of a long smoke ? And do not each and allof these effects clearly and irrefra blyestablish excess in everyrC0SO? We affirm most uxhesitatingly that
setting aside idic,ynroaies, there is hardly an habitual smoker to exoess who cannot be condemned by the most casual observation of his bodily functions. Acnd the further we move upwards in the social gamut the more striking will ba the physiological evidences of excess in any individual case.
It is almost unnecessary to make a separate inquiry into the patholoiical conditions which follow upon excessive smohng. Theybhave been referred to by the way. Moreover, abundant evidenoe has been adduced in the correspondence in orr columns of the gigantic evils which attend tho abuse of tobacco. Let it be grauted at once that there is such a thing as moderate smoking, and let it be admitted that we cannot accuse tobacco of being gauilty of the whole of Cufcn's Nosotogy, it still remains that there is a long catalogue of frightfal penalties attached to its abuse.
Let us bnieSy recanitulate:
1L To smokeaGrlin the day is excess.
2. As peoplo are generally constituted, to smoke more than one or two pipes of tobacco, or one or two cigars daily, is excems.
3. Youthful indulgenco in smoldng is excess.
4. There are physiological indications which, occurring in any individual caso, are criteria of exoess.
We most earnestly desire to see the habit of smoking diminish, and we entteat the youth of this country to aban-
do,n it altogether. Let them lay or advice to hart. Let thdem giVe up a dubious tleasIre for a- certain good. Ten years hence ,e shall receive their thanks.

Inland and Submarine Telegraphic Communication.
IKLAND and SUBAfARIz.M TELEGBAYHIa
COMMUNIZOATION.
The attention of all speculatots, both on this andt" other side of the Atlantic, has of late been mnuch diredl t. this important subject The gigantic Undertaings of rseoat companies and the gigantio failures which have aigul
theefforts of others have left the public minA in a it ef EOme uncertainty as to the practicablity of great eesa lines of telegraphic communication, no matter how m they may be desired or how willingly themoneymab forthooniing for all attempts to form them. As yet how,r ever, lotwithstanding the popularity of the idea, there La
been no great system of telegraphs devised, egpecaly suc1a' AS obtain in the United States, This has been ln pe&. owing to tho expense, which, by inducing extra cbargs
has, of oourse, by redacing the number, rendered t1. transmion oE messaes lefs lucrative than was at firu expectod, and partly owing to the great obstacle wbi&hA
present themselves inthe way of long mibmarine 6ables. A schema, however, is in prooess of being org%nistiv which at least promise to meet all U*ikrwua, to bring the means of inland commuleation to time' doors of all in the united kingdom, and to fathonri with its submarine lines the broadest and most dist4at seau
sther the proposed plAn Wl answer or not we caezosay, though, if properly carried out, it ought to do soo foE the improvements which it expeets to introduce into X means of telegraphing are not ks important then thechnge It propose to effect in the ystem its,f. Tb.ae mhanical aids and inventiox are the patents ee Xr, Allan, -who has devoted himself with untiing ener to. perfecting the electric telegrapb, to the developmentof which he has applied practically some of the more important recent discoveries of our chief electriciaus. Thoe ima_ provements consist, first, in essential mechanical alterations introduced into the construction of sbmarine cables, anu(
next in various new apparatus for the application to the, telegraph of Faraday's most valuable discoveries in voltaia electrioinduction. On both pointsthegaintothepubieshoulS begreatif theinventions andthefurtherimprovements whlchl theywill naturally suggest are Properlyandenergetically c*.
ried into effect. The error which hasa hiterto proved ao.- fatal to most plans for submarine communication has beea.. that of having a ponderous cable, weighing six or sight
tons, and costing from 300. to 500. per mile. These cables,.. as our readers are aware, are oomposed by winding spirally eight or ten stout iron wires round A soft Core of gottapercha, which contains the insulated conducting wires of
copper, laid straight. In attempting tola down su-h nes. In deep wAter-teirweightis so enormous that they can only. be prevented sinking in a mas by powerful breaks an the drum on which they are coiled, and which, when they act at al, strain the cable to such an extent that the outside. spiral wires, working upon the soft core, stretch, while the conducting wires, lid straight along the centre, cannot. In; nearly every instance, therefore, in which weighty cables have been laid down in deep seas, either some of the conduct. ing wires have been severed entirely, or when the stralnWan,d pressure have been greatest their in5ulation has been injured. or they have become attenusted. The first two accidcnt
of course utterly destroy the whole cable as a medium for telegraphic communication, while the last is sarcely less injurious, as in aU conductors of electricity the weakest. Part becomes ihe standard of the whole, and the difficulty already experienced in getting a ful-sized wire to conduct a current sufficient to transmit a message along 1,00(1 miles of submarine cable would, of course, be incrase
almost indefinitely with a wire reduced by strain in any part to half its original diameter. Almost all these accidents have occurred in attempts to lay long lines of cable nader deep sea" This was especially the case with tne Mediterranean cable, which, from its preposterous weight, ran out so fast that no breaks were sufficiently powerful to check it, though in the attempt to do so the conducting wires were crushed, nd "kins"occurred so rapidly thatin a very shorts distance all of them were severed, and it was at last founl necessary to abandon the cable altogether. So with. the cable in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, And so with the second cable in the Mediterranean, bet tweenSardinia nd Algeria. To overcome these difficulties, which seem to offer almostinsurmountable obstales to any long line of submarine communication, Mr. Allaas has invented a new kind of cable, which, when once seen, is,, like breaking the egg, a wonderfully simple solution of the present difficulties. It is a cable about one inch in dia. meter, the centre of which is formed by 19 wires, of tinned. iron wire, twisted into one strand, an inch in circumference. This is enclosed in a case of indiarubber, coated over with a mixture of tar and sand. The cost of the whole is only 701. per mile, nd its weight only &cwt. The core of this cabla is thus made both its strength and its conductor. The con. ducting power of iron as compared with copper is as 24 to 120, but the increased sectional area afforded by the large iron strand more than compensates for the relative differ, enoe. But under certain circumstances the strand may be formed ofiron and coppermixed, combinin&theenhanced con.
ductibility of the copper with the strength of the iron,sothat where weight to carry or much increased conductibility is a6 minor consideration the amount of metal andinsulationmay. be subdivided, and so form several conductors without at alI diminishing its strength as a whole. They can be made orx this principle of iron and copper mixed, and so as without; mixing the metals in each conductor they will be formed ot conductors of different metals. The lightness and compara. tive smalness of this cable make it appear but a slendec thread by which to join distaut climes, sundered by the rollf of the great waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; but; experience has shown that within certain limits as to dQra. bility the cable cannot be too light. In the present instance it is so constituted as to have a reLatively greater speacfl
gravity to the water, and no more than is required for the purpose of submerging itself graduaUy. Thus, without the use of damaging breaks on the dram, it may be laid lengthwise on the surface, finding its way to the bottom in that position, it requiring all its weight and the friction in the water for the last few hundred yards to produce forcc sufficient to withdraw it from the ship. No depth of water or distance from laud can at all affect the laying downv of such a cable. Another great difficulty in submarine tele. graphic communication is in getting the electric current along a great length of wire. Propelling a messege, so to speak-, requires an intensity of electricity which at present cannot be produced without quantity, and which in long distanoes charges the conducting wire and produces a retard. ing influence, the proper means to overcome which are to this hour an enigma among the most profound electricians.
If we are rightly informed, there are both land and submarine wires going comparatively short distances from this metropolis, to send a message through which requires batterg power to an extent that is perfectly amazing, and even them in damp or unfavourable weather the needle moves most sluggishly. It is still almost doubtful whether this retarding influence, in whatever manner it is caused, may not prove a fatal obstacle to any submarine cable between tWs country and America. Mr. Allan meets this difflculty by a novel application of the secondary coil, by means of which he produces an induced current the great intensity of which is almost equal to the coil of Rum. loff. The result of the experiments that have been as yet tried with this apparatus have been in the highest degree satisfactory. The only doubt that exists in our mind is tbht, in case of only one wire being laid, as with the newly contrived cable, the water must be used for the returnL current, which supposes a perfection of insulation in the conducting wire such as, for a distance of 2,C00 or 3,00U miles, it will be difficult, and indeed almost impossible, to attain. But we presume the subject of a return wie to complete the circuit will be a matter for the subsequent oonsideration of the company. It is proposed by the com. pany that is about to avail itself of these patents to establish, in the first instance, a system of telegraphic communicatioxa throughout the united kingdom almost as complete and ex. tensiveasourpreasentpostalarrangewents. Itisintendedtolay down perfectly new lines, communicating direct from &on. don with all tho chief manufacturing towns, which are to form sub-centres with the smaller towns and even village
around them. The wires will be thinly coated in gutta. percha, and laid in numbers branehing off to the differenrt towns en rout. The cost of each wire it is estimated wily
not exceed 10. per mile. It is intended by these to convey messages to all parts of the kingdom at one uniform rate oE ls. a-mes sge, or a penny a-word irrespective of distnce. This principle has already answered well in the United States and S witzerland, where it is found that th e revenueF of the telegraph developes itself in geometrical progreosiow
according to t nu mber of towns iniluded by it. Thus, it
12 of the larg est tov ns in En gland send on an average M. messages per d ay to each other, the gross receipts , without includm g intervenin g stations, would be 120,452, , w whil 24
towns sending 100 messages per day would yield nearly 500,0001 per annum. For carrying out this system Mr. Allan has devised a recording telegraph, a great improve. ment on ,ose's and Bain s's, whicb, whilo avoiding the mis. takes which in spite of the utmost care so often oteur witht
the needle telegraph, can be worked at less than half itscost.
