A bill had already been preparedwhich would, to a considerable extent, efect theobject aimed at by tbe noble adi earuned lord in xespect to a reduction of fees now received by the County Vourts, bUthe colda not athWismoment bring hns memoty to bear asto whether the bill would give a right of appln those cases of insolvency which were disposed bf by the -ounrty Courts but he begged to assure his noble and learne friend tilat he would bear the matter in mind. LTi BRCOTUGHAM said that without such right of apyeal being given the biil would be of very little use. COLONiEL OSE ANqD LORD STRATFORD. Earl GREY gave notice that he would on FRiday next *Ak the noble lord the Secretary of State for Foreign Afairs whether he could give any- eplanation of the apparent contradiction between Colonel ose's despatch of the 25th of fKrach1 183, and that of lord Stratford of the 27th of May -ollovnag.

THE GREAT CLOCK OF THE NEW pATL&CE. The Karquis of CLANRICARDE moved for copies of the Iapers and correspondence relting to the great clock and hell for the new pace at Westminster. Thesepaers, if prodced, would afford such a specimen of blunderig, of eonficting authority, and of confusion in the carryin on of Vie business relating to the clock an would, he believed, astonish their lordshaps.

The passage of Her Majesty's Speech relatiug to tho burdens onthe-mercantile marine havingbeen read'y the clerk at the table, The House, upon the motion of lfr. Lowe, resolved itself into a committee to consider the local dues -popn shipping. Mr. LOWR.-Yr. Vitzroy,-I have to asik the indulgence of the House while I endeavour to brng before thenz a col. plicated and m3portant question with which I caunot boast inuch familiarity or long experience, but to 'which I have given such time and attsntiom as I could commind. When thenavigationlaws wererepealeditbecame the duty of the Government to look inlto the condition of our shipowners, 'whowere then exposed to unrestricted competition with foreign shipowners, and to see that they were not preadioed by any lAws or iapos}tions -whith placed them at an undue disadvantage with their riv,.ls Itis only due to the gentlemen who have recently filled the OfEce of P?resident of the Board of Trade to say that jx nO depa* ment of the State have greater and more imporfAnt reforM beet effected that in the laws adecting shipping, the conditionot our sailors, and the affairs tonnected with that Isnb*ct. Sice the navigation laws were repealed the whole law relative to shipping has been consolidted into one act, so that everyperson wayunderstand thelawat ornce. | The claim of Her MAIest's ships to salvage, which had frequently produced didiculty and ill-feeling, has een reuced and modified. The masters and mates of inerchant vessel we compelled to undergo an ecxaniuation before the lives of passengers and crews arm intrusted to them. An ofirce has been created by which sailors are enabled, upon cnming on shore, to exciange their pay for money-orders, payable at any port in the kingdom, whereby thousands of pounds awe annually saved to the families of sallors which wouad have been spent in the first orgies of recovered liberty. Another change has been that of collecting, without expense to ,their survivors, the wages and effects of deceased seamen, by vwich many thousands are r recovered for the widows and families of sailors that would formerly have been absorbed in legal expenses. An inquiry has also been instituted into the causes of wrecks and the misconduct of masters of ships, which has been a great check upon mny reckless and dangerous pracices, and an indacement to the cutiwtion of habits of sobriety and increased care. Then, the law in regard to the receivers of Admiralty droits and the salvage clafined by person ia possession of wrecked vessels has been Placed on a more satisfactory footing, and while the rights Of salvors have been attended to, they have been prevented from seIigVWrek-ed vessels and holding them as against the owners. The lighthouse dues have been reduced bylO5,0(. a- year, but, owing to an improved adlninistrationof the fund, it isnowinso prosperous a state that lighthouses are being built in Scotlandand other parts. I mention these as samples of the activity of the Board of Trade since the navigation laws were repealed, and to show that in the present measure w e are only carrying out a series of inportant improvements, which have already begun, and are, indeed, far advar.ced. In the.year 1852 the right hon. gentleman the member for 'Buldnghanhire,-howasthenChamcelor oftheEcheqner, made a speech in whichhe used these expressions:- "It seemns to ns indefeasible rhat, when tho principle of unrestricted competition is established, the shippingirnterest of this country should be payinga tax, not for the lights supplied for their benefit (because for them they pay su&ciently), but in order that improvident grants of former Sovereigns and ParEiaments should be counterabied by a peculfar tax raised from them, and in respect to which they get no return whatever. We think, aso, that al that which is levied from the shipping interest under the name of' passing tol' is a vexation, a grievance, and a bden, to wiuchet - o tiing his countot, underpresent circupn tanlces, ogeht not tumbe subjected." lTese words of the rght hon. gentleman may be slpposed to have had some effect iplon the rp erdeen Gvernment, fandatofhaveled to the issue of a commission under the Government seal to inquire inLto the local burdens upon thipping. The comnissioners, of wehom there were three, afterinvestigaiugthe subject witih comumendable ability eald, and industry, made a report in 1854, which is the foundation for the bill that I shall ask the leave of the Htouseto introduce. 1inay as well state at flnst that from this bill the port of London is excludaed, because the affairs of the corporation of LondonL have cometunder another comnMission,whichhas since mnade areport4 andtherecommenda. tions in which, arrived at after independent inquiry and considertion, rein accordanoe with thoseof the connission on iocalduesand shipping. The amountor dues6rnshippingin 1855, for all purposes of harbours and every other purpose, s 1,095,396M., and of that amount there were applied tOD maritime puroses 82W,PM9? There thus remained a heaVy balance Of 275,2971. raised by taxation tupon shippitg =which is not appliedto shipping purposes. It is withthe ap. proopriationof that balance that we are concerned to-night. We will see what becomes of it, why it is annually drawn, whetherit is just that it should continue to be so drawn, and how it may be more justly admb'istereL The items which snaLe up this amount are-Fstly, rassing tolls levied by certain harbours upon ships that io not enter; secondly, town dues levied by municipal corporations, wvhich are not devoted to municipal pu es ;ftardly, clIaritable funds levied upon shipping; and, fourt, secial taxe graised in the harboursof ])linand Coric Ey Her&ajesty's Government, and devoted to theiayvment of e.xpenses dte totheconsolidatedfond. Theseitemns nearly cover the sum that I have mentioned. The accomunts L am about to state are those of 1852, but they have been augmented since that time; and as the increasehas been computed at 10 pcent., the amount at the present time is not e's than M000., and ever statement Ihare to mike isto be thken with a similar addition. The first charge is for passing tols. The pasing tols are four in number, and are lesied be the ports of Dover, amVte. Bridlington, and Wh}ithy. They amount to 37,49i Te fhistV is iover.

The severity of this tanxis not to be exceeded, and whjpt makes it worse is that the Liverpool prt extends from the river Dee to8th river Ribble, and fromn the enttrance of the Mrersey to Euncorni. t extendls also to Birkenhead; andi Birkenhend and Runcomn have tnp contribute to the JUverpool docks and town dues. It is acomplaint on the part of some that persons in south Watles;, if they send coals thenice to Runcorm, pay a duty of 2d. per ton, which is eqI'to the whiole of the royalty de- lmadedeOf the Owner oft'he coal ; and,on the part of others that iron fromn Scotland is sent by Meletwood- instead of Rumcomn, to Avoid the dut.y of 3d. per ton. The ima. mu-ity of the freemen of Liverpool from these duties is -also complained of; andl it is stated that a freemant was enabled to obtains aCertainQ contrAct in preference to ano..ther persn, because b2egot the goods necessary for carryig out the conitract tollifree. Tliar,then, is the case oM mam for whose benefit the tolls am.- imposedi not contributing towards themn, and bemg ensbled thereby successfully to compete with his nelghbour. In consequence of these duties a great deal of trade is driven out of its natural cOurse and finds5 its waY fo- Chester, where the dues are light.

The conmittee is no doutb aware that many of these eornorations and charities have been in the habit of mpoDsing iffe rentiHal dues on shipping; that i hiher. dues on foreign vesels 'than on ihose which are theproperty of British ownerm Tn 1810 tbis country concluded a xeciprocitytreaty witha Portnga'l, and in Mfivith the tlnitedb tates; hut whien these treaties came to be- put.,into operation it was found that these local dues stood in the way. An act was accordingly passed which, treting thesie dues in accordance with the political acnosmy N he time, -as the property oDf the corporations by, which they -were l>enole, too aay al power of levyping tem in every case where these reciprocity treaties came into operation, but at the same time enabled the Treasury to give compensation. This same principle of comapensution -was extenided likewse to aon x repocity treaties then exitig, or 'which igibt afterwards be made. 'Under this act no'less than 527912. has beenpid from the consolidated Jund for coimpensation for differential dies during the Ar 1855 hsompenation o hs increased very Tapidly: in IM it Was ai 1846, 27,0 00; in 1847, K4M0. ; in 1848, 34,2W01. iii 1849, 5%WU0. ; inA 125%, 44A000 - and, no doubt,'if allowved to go on increasing, it ~wud~ soon amount to 100,O001 In the same way foreign vessels ha&ve been obliged to -pay higher for- pilots thau British vessels, a as thet re uipronty treaties vehiret the abolition of thatrivilege, a lnarge sumr has been paid as besato for tha abolition. The town of Liverpool received in 1852 6001 front the consolidated fund as compensation for the lots of these iotage dnes. over and abfve the compensation for the dwifential dues ; Necascptle received 3,500. for the pilotag and 6000. for etb diferentie,s, and- hu 10,5(01.for the duesuand=forpbilothge. The qusiuonnow come, how arewetod el withat the echartges. Andf irst, astothe passilgtolls.

The true principle of taUtion I take to be this, and it is the gde we have fopored ai framing tis bill, that it is otely sowble for a portit of a, class or a divisdon of the country to tax itself for its owm benefit butt that it has ao right to tax its nieighbonr or the ommunity at large. There is always a question about,the incidence of thse due. Part of thet undoubtedly falu on t'he saipping interstm which immediately ayrrs themi and pat upoii the donsumer, but in the various fWuctuation of the market it cannot be denied that a great portioni of them must be paid by the shipping interestb Itook upon it that the parties concenedre n the public at large nd the hPi~nrg biterest. As to passing tolls, the hill provide in lhe' instanco that t'hoy bsll be totally ana entire abolished; s uttheylea ebehindthemadifficlty nadto ealing wit the debts coanected with th case At Dover, where theotoll-g 0001. a-yeai; the dlebt amounts to'ne less summthan83v001.,'hih is i t haga:pais tol and other property.

That dispoes of the passing tolls. The town dues, or dutes levied upon sh~ipping, and applied to the purPoses of municipal corporations, also appear to ine to be susceptible of verY simfile treatment. I grunt that there is a legal rih o these dlues, because it has been, give h act of Pariatment; but Z cannot conceive upon ha prin. ciple,. ex agucyO et done, a corporations ean be juistified in raising, by taxing the shiping which comes into its harbour, sams applied for thep hnefit, not of shipping, huat of the ratepayer of the town. I have shown how in. jirrous such a Practice is to the places where it obtains; a nd I1 need only add that the shipownier is clearly as mauch entitled to juxstice as the ratepayer; and that, as in the case ol the rat-Payer, all sums raised by rates levied upon hima are Iapplied topurposes invhich he has an interest so the shp. owner has a right to calam that all sums raised by taxeso shipping shall be devotedl to purposes in which a hipping ii interisted I Wil put the casen AOhigher, and it seems fc Ime that, put so, at'isimpossible to answer it. Of course we olnialheaIr Of veste interests; firt over ana over agi thi House has decided--and I think it vwill not go baick from that decision-that in this matter thereis the widest possible distinction between corporations orpbli odies ana private individuals, r. Rallarm, -a high cauthority on such points, says, in the first volume of his Constitus. -tioned -Bistory of Emiglanrd thnat Parliament, although hound,to respct the legal interest of private persons, ,is not withiheld by any such rule with regard to c-orporations when it can be shown that the abolition of such interests is for thae public bmeneit, or that their reten. tion 'Would be unjust or impolitic. [ therefore conclutde that 'we shalldo nowrongwhateverhy relievingtheship -a interest from the payment of the enormous sum of 182,00 7-probably nowa more than 2D00M,001a-year, wrung from them by various corporations of England, Scotland, andi ITeland, a-na appliedl to namats in which it has no, inte- rs,and from which it derives no benefit whatever. Thematter is not, howeer sosmpIa it maight appear. The funds raised by these dues are che'Fo-3arged with debts, anda the questonariseswhat is tobe done-with t'he delbta -He, Maj-SesysCommissioners unhesitat ly recommnended that where these dehts had been contracted for town -purposes In 'which thte shipping had no interest they should 'be trans. ferred to the borough fund.

The principle we p ropose to adopt is this :-.As to the creditor there wll bono change. He will still have his - remedyagainst either the borough fund or that derived fom the dues on ships - but, as between- these funds, we propose to divide the dett in proportion to their respective amounts. We propose to take this sum-as tha borough fund, or the f und ariing from the taxes on town property, is tothefndarisingfrom thetaxaionofistipping, asboEa be the portion of the debt borne by the borough fund to that borne by the shipping dues fund. e debts cbhjble on town dues in common with other town revenues in oglhand, 1 Scotland, and ireand, wae 2570378L ; the town dues on ipping, 182,; the aing town renues are 410,0101. the sum, therefore, is 410,0104 isto182505, sowilwbetheportonof2,576,378. which shallbobebneby theboroighfndatotihat.bichsaIhlbebornebythe slip. pin dues fud.

TO THE FVMOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As myname is mentioned in the letter signed " Co- mopolitan," in V ac Times of this day, and as the 'wrter is in error in saying that the position I sketched was not actually talen up, I beg to write you this letter on the subject. 'The day oefore the battle of Salananca the Duke was or a hill near Cabrerizos4 on the right of the Torines, observing 'the enemycrossingthe3iver atHuerta. Heturned to me, ana said, "Biae over there" (pointing to the other side of the tiver), 'and mse what sort of a positionthereis to stop thero, and niake a sketch of it, and let me see how soon You will be ack Trhe sketch, therefore, was made on the spur of the moment, and, as one may say, immediately before the battle, not some time before, as stated by "Cosmopolitan.", There was no time for a previous exaninationof the ground, mad nobody accompanied me, not even an orderly to act as a point. VWhen I retured the Duke was still on the same ground anxiously watching the enemy. He desired me to put the sketch in ink, and I sat downon the ~round and put it in ink accordingly. The position extended from Santa Marta on the left to the two Arapiles Ells on the right, which were included in the sketch. The position ws occupied that same evening, whereas "Cosmopolitan" says it was not actually talken up; andtha following morning, when the Duke of Wellington rode to it before daylight, I rcceived orders from his Grace for the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Divisions, which were then our that position, Soon after daylight the enemy shiowed a dispoaltion to attack, but ffnding the position strongly occupied be de. sstedL Towards tho afternoon he pushed on his left to turn: our right) and that brought on the battle; and therefore'tho battle was fought to the right of the position I ha sketched. The fact of so great a general as the Duke requiringa position to be sketched in great haste sho'ws the necessity of education to qualify for the Quartermaster-Generar1s de partment. In that department one is alwzays worl;inz against tie. If a report or a sketch of a road or of a position cannot be got in time, it is of no use. $he late General Jazy, in one of his igh Wycombe letures, says :"A sla guerre l'dpargno la plus precieuse eit celle du temp)s." t nt Sir. you1r ol,,dient serernit. ?

ZOrDOX, T'UESDAY, FEBBUARY 5, 1856. The Elouse of Lords met yesterday at 5 o'clock. In presenting a petition from the corporation of heffield, complainin g of the amount of fees exacted in County Courts, Lord J3iouonIa gave notice of huis intention to bring in a bill to improve the administration of justice in those courts. The LonD CHAwcxaop. stated that a bill had already been prepared by the Government, which would, to a great extent, remedy the evil complained of. Earl Gnnvgave notice that he should, on Friday next, put a question to Lord CrOw on the discrepancy betwieen the despatch of Colonel Rosx, of the 2eth of March last, and that from Lord STmArFOR11D DX REDCL, dated the 27th of May. The Marquis of 0L& cRCDEr, in moving for copies of correspondence relating to the great cloc:k and bells of the Palace at Westminster, complained of the confused system and contradictory authorities under which this part of the works of the new building had -been conducted. Lord GRAxNVL admitted the inconvenience, but hoped the clock and bells would be complete by the close of the present year. The House then adjourned. The House of Commons having resolved itself into a committee on the acts relating, to merchant shipping, Mr. Iown moved for leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of passing tolls and the regulation of local dues upon shipping. After alluding to the improvements already made in this part of our commercial code, and to the large amount of the local taxation upon shipping,-including, besides passing tolls, town dues, charities, and special taxes,-he proceeded to explain the nature of these various dues. Some of them, he contended, were not only unjust in principle, but they operated prejudicially to the ports where they were levied, by deterring vessels from entering them. In other instances the fiuds were expended for objects entirely unconnected with shipping or maritime purposes. It was proposed to deal with this taxation in the following manner :-The passing tolls, which rested, he said, upon no ground of justice or policy, it was intended to abolish, making provision for the discharge of debt incurred upon the security of the tolls. It was proposed likewise to give powers to- do away withn a p'ortion of the town dues,i transferring theremainderto the Government, respecting the rights of creditors, but apportioning the debt between the dues retained and the municipal funds. The charity dues it was intended to deal with. in an analogous mauner, abolishing some and acdministering the rest through the instrumentality of the Government. Other dueswould be dealt with in a special manner, compensations being given in certain cases of abolition. The result wvould be an ultimate relief of shipping from a burden of about 2CO,OOO., and at the same time the gettmig rid of the obnoxious principle of allowing one portion of the community to tax another. Mr. HzADLAni, thoug,h prepared to support any measure for the relief of ship ing fron taxation, protested against dealing wit corporations dife-| rently from individuals, and taking away their property without compensation. * r. HonsrSAM suggested that there was a preiiminary question, whether tle corporations had not (as he contended they had) a legal title to these ues. This question should be settled in a court of law. After some remarks by Mr. RcxE, MIr. M. GresoN said he rejoiced that the Government had resolved to deal 'with this question, and not to allow corporations to tax shipping for their ownvbenefit. A few observations having been made by Mr. Ionura, MIr. W. S. LmnSA'Y, Mr. 1 ;WAI50, and Mr. tows in reply, the resolution moved by him was agreed to, and, upon the House having resumed, cave w:as given to bring in the bilL. Gir G. G moved for leave to bring in a bill to amend the acts relating to the metropolitan police, its object being, he said, to place the undivided ontrol, responsibility, and managenient of the police of the metropolis in the hands of one commissioner, and uponl the same footing as the Irish c onstRabulary. Lieave was given. s - Lord DaI)m CxRiG brought up thle Q 's answer to the Address. On the motion of Mr. WImsoa S select committee wasappointed to inquie into the offices for assaying silver and gold wares. Leave was given to AMr. HORSASu to intiroduce bills further to amend the Laws relating to prisons in LIeland and to the burial of the dead in Ireland, and for the better care and reformation of youthful offenders in Ireland. The Marquis of BLAwDFORD moved for leave to bring. in a bill .to make better provision for the management of episcopal and capitular property. .ObjeLtions were, inde to th,e motion by Mr. . DFIM - and 3Ir. w. Win,rxs, but it was supiported by lord Praaxssrc and agreed to. I ord BwcoroFz likewise obtained leave to bring 'inL a bill to facilitate the formation and endowment of, separate and distinct parishes. - Mr. CJUFUiD moved for-leaveto bring in a biU to enable execution to issue in any part of the united kinkdom under judgments or decreets phtainecl in certain Courts of Record in England, Scotland, and Ireland. - After a few remarks by Mr. NAPna,' Sir F. KI L, and- the SouxcroR-G_NEsnA, leave was given. Mr. W}msrz moved for leave to introduce- a series of five biBls, the objects of which were to makle provision for the more speedy and effectual despatch of business in the Court of Chancery in Ireland; to amend the practice and course of proceeding in that court; to alter the law and pfactice of the Court in relation to the appointment of receivers and management of estates; to secure tha titles of purchasers of estates sold under the Court; and to facilitate and diminish the expense of appeal. After some remarks by Mr. W. W33ars, leave was given. Mr. J. D. F=zGmtALD ramoved for leave to bring in a bil to abolish the Encumbered Estates Court n Ireland, to enlarge -the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in Ireland,increase its power, ad reform its procedure. The saving by -the abolition of the Encumbered Estates Court and of four M1asters in Chancery, he said, would be 30,4291 per annum; the expense of the new machinery established by the bill would' be 16,7601. per annum, and the life compensations 13,381.; so that the alterations would cost the country nothing, and ultimately,' by the falling in of the life compensations, there would be a saving of 14,0001. a-year. After adverting to the enormous amount of business disposed of in six years by the EncumberedEstates Court, andto the benefit it had conferred upon the country, he stated the reasons assigned by the commisaioners, in their report, forputting an endto that tribunal and fortransferring itsjurisdiction to the Court of Chancery under an amended piocedure, with the assistance of two ViceChancellors and with an Appellate Court. The bill he proposed to introduce carried out the recommendations of the commissioners, abolishing the Encumbered Estates Court, investing the Court of Chancery in Ireland 'with its jurisdiction, reforming and simplfying the procedure of this Court, abolishing the Maters, appointing two Vice-Chancellors, and constituting a Court of Appeal from each of the equity judges. It was proposed lkewise very materialIy to reduce, and ultimately to abolish,- the fees and' stamps now paid on proceedings in the court. The provisions of the bill, he observed, had been framed with great care, and he believed that no measure hind beenpresented to theHouse calculated to nIlord more benefit to the pubLic. Mr. WHrrssmn urged, among other objections to the proposed alterations, that the abolition of fees would entail their abolition in the courts of this country ; that it was inexpedient.to pension active of icers of the Irish Court of Chancery and to replace them with others; and that the arrears of the Encumbered Estates Court (1,300 cases) shoiild not be thrown upon the Court of Chancery. He should move, he said, that the measure, founded, asit was, upon a permanent principle,-that of making the Court of Chancery the general conveyancer of real estates,-be extended to England. MIr. CArNns defended the measure, which he considered an experiment in an excellent direction, and replied to the objections of Mr. W rEEsms. He did not approve the provision for substituting for fees a poundage upon estates, thus making one species of property pay the expense of aU the litigation. in the court. Mr. MnALfs and Mr. GEoRiGE spoke in condemnation of the bilL and Mr. V. ScurLLv in favour of it. Leave was then given. Leave was also given to Mr. PELLATT to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to draughts on bankers, after some remarks by Mlr. Wisox. Lord Du2cAw- obtained leave for the LoRD ADvoCATE to bring in bills to consolidate and amend the laws relating to bankruptcy in Scotland; to make further provision for the removal of nuisances and prevention of diseases, and for the police of towns, in Scotland; and to regulate the procedure in actions, causes, and other proceedings which are at present competent before the Court of Exchequer in Scotland. The House adjourned at a quarter to 11 o'clock.
The Englishman fully believes that he long ago discovered and establshed the principle of no taxationwithout representation, and consequent responsibility to the taxpayer. He believes, in the general, that no other people in the world so closely watch the expenditure of the public money, or so effectually secure that it is not diverted from its legiti- mate purposes. With that amiable inconsistency, | however, that marks all his proceedings, he has also permitted the growth of an exceptional system, ! which has acquired such magnitude as to be rather the rule than.the exception, and which has almost completely neutralized the principle of representation. No other Government has authorized such immense taxing powers in the hands of corporations, and left them'so uncontrolled in their' expenditure. No doubt, the burden wvould long ago have been intolera'ble, had there not risen up with it the countervailing system of protection. Taxation, in fact, was the " huneh- "bacel' that everybody was trying to put off on his i neighbour. Everybodyvwouldundertake anyamountI himself, if he might be permitted to make some-! body else bear it for him, and, alieni aopetens, s1i: profusus, rejoiced at once in the pleasures of extortion and generosity, robbingPEErnto pay PAuL, and only desirous to rob rather more than he paid, so as to get a percentage on the circulation of roguery. The burdens on shipping would not have been tolerated for a day had not British shipping been protected; and, on account of that protec- X tion, the Legislature has gone on laying burden on burden upon it. It has been said by those who earn money in ill ways that they feel a sort of burning to get rid of it, which they do not feel for honest gains; and a certain sense of the injustice of rates and tolls levied on ships simply because they came into a port or passed by it has led to a very lax use of the proceeds. None but a protected interest would have quietly borne so long that Liverpool, Newcastle, and Hull should together levy 118,6001. a-year from ships for the decoration of their towns and other civic purposes; or that ships should pay for passing a port which they never entered, which few of them could enter, and which perhaps they did not even see; or pay to liahthouses that had long ceased to be of any use,' and were only a pretence for some extravagant job in times gone by. But so long as aU these charges could be worked up into a case for protection they were paid without grudging. It is only when the protection is over that shipowners themselves ask to be relieved from them. The result is that protection has proved a hothouse for forcing young taxes, and rates, and tolls to the most splendid dimensions and monstrous varieties. The details of the Russian corporation stated by Mr. LowE last night are only a rather picturesque example of the general practice. It appears that not only English shipping entering the Neva, but even all Russian imports into this country, are taxed for such purposes as the chaplain and schools at St. Petersburg, an organ and churchwarden at Moscow', a portrait of the present EirzoRoa, a frame for the portrait of the last, and a grand dinner on the Qum's coronation. This, however, is not by any means so 'absurd as that a ship should not be alowed to enter the stream of the i Mersey and discharge a part of its cargo into a couple of lighters without being- made to pay, inone case, 641. towards the public buildings, paving, lighting, and other general purposes of L Iverpool.' But even. thesefpresosjr : ev'n the' pervorsionts are ex-, |Ceededin grotesqueness bya eustom-which has teenatecally st'opped the money 'paid b shipas for' the erection and support of lighthouses, and lpcit clarge sums of it on the *oiphaiLs of sailors, 8a. that the same, process maintained -existing orphans and made many inore, and 'tho instittion supplied itself both with funds and with objects. The storyof our harbours 'of refuge is equally characteristic of our country. Here. are four' harbours of refuge, all of which have cost vast sums, and all are qqually useless, their approaches bad, and their entrances narrow and shallow. At Dover, Ramsgate, BridlinWton, and lYhitby there are harbours and costly piers 'and all the parade of refuge, but 'uharybdis 'itself and the port, of tho Lestrygones would not be more certain destruteion to any collier, for example, of ordinary tonnage' that should attempt to enter in a storm, or, indeed, at most hours out of the twenty-four. It is as if the fox not only invited the storkl to dine from a platter, but made him pay for the dinner which he could not get into his bill. But not a word was to be said against it. The grievauce was to grow and prosper. The commissioners might do what they pleased with the money-have regattas, balls, 'and public rooms; for these tolls were among the burdens of the British shipowner, and it was to help him under them that he was always invoking the kind heart of the British Parliament. The most astolunding case is that of' Liverpool, unot only for the prodigality of tlle abase and the effrontery with which it is defended, but' from the 'fact of its being at such a place, where it might be supposed commerce, if anywhere, would vindicate its - rights. The corporation levied more "'than 100,0001. a-year from shipping, and only -spent. for maritime. purposes 3,0007., making a, virtue of spending- even so - much, inasmuch as 4001. was believed to be the limit of the legal obligation. Thus, wahile Parliament has been starving'the Treasury, first of one tax and then of another, and while all England has had to pay income-tax professedly to cover the free import of food and raw materials, the corporation of Liverpool have gone on till now levying from commerce the vast sum we have mentioned for the improvement of their town It is now alleged that the borough has a legal right to the' tax, and that if all the commerce of tne world flowed into Liverpool on its way to the manufacturers of Manchester, and the West Riding the corporation of Liverpool might, if they pleased, pave their streets with gold by the proceeds of the ta_. So the member for Liverpool is duly instructed by his modest constituents to say, with what gravity he can, that it is a question for the Courts, not for Parliament, and that the corporation think it a robbery to be deprived of their tolls! The' warning is now hardly needed, as people better understand the revoking power of lawv-in other words, that the law of this country is not that of the MIedes and Persians. But hitherto this sort of defence has been so successfully maintained that Parliament has had to buy its own exemptions from the bylaws of Liverpool and other corporations. It could not sanction a treaty or give a neighbour the -benefit of the most favoured nation claluse without repaying to a dozen corporations the differential port or pilotage dues which they had established against foreigners. Happily this sort of thing is beginning to be-almost incredible., Happily it is "a vestige " of ancient fraud." Yet, as what, has happened may happen again,- we trust that the Legislature will not be so thrown off its guard as to encourage the opinion that a Parliamentar-y concession may grow into an inalienable right after it has ceased to be useful, or even honestly applied.
If any one wishes for another proof of the old maxim that " truth is great and will prevail," let him call to mind the discussions of. the last twrelve months, and then read with attention the reports of Sir JoHx ArNEsn. and Colonel TuLLocH which we are now daily publishing. We cannot regret that the publication of these documents has been delayed until the 'matters in question have become things of the past. -The deadly campaig-n is over, sueees and some glory have rewarded the endurance of our troops, the excitement has passed away, the tempest of rancorous recrimination has subsided, and taen are able to judge with eahuness 'of what are now historical events. Whlo does not remember the first whispered tidings of mismaliagementand disaster, the letters stealtlLily shown under a promise of secrecy, the tremour of alarn which brought back the Quxim- and her scattered Cabinet from the Highlands or the shores of the Channel? Who does not remember the first :letters of our correspondents, sounding a note of warning, which interrupted the rejoicings for Alma, and told an exulting nation that longer fatigues and more endiuing bravery must precede the fuill triumph which was every day expected ? WVe cannot wonder at the commotion that followed. We cannot even regret that the public- should have been astonished, incredulous, almost indigniant, at those who dared to give, to their countrymen those mlwelcome truths, those humiliating cautions. . The people of England had trusted their Government with the confidence of children. Although the soul of almost every man was in the .aralthough the nation was determined to carry oit the great crusade against despotic aggression-yet there was a point at wlhich popular interference ended. ' The Cabinet had 'been blmaed for its delays, diplomatists had been' sneered at for the inopportune and ineffective exercise of their craft, but these little discontents were only directed against the supposed iunwillingness of statesmen to act vith boldness in commencing a necessary war. When hostilities were proclaimed satisfaction returned, and at no period in our history was a Govern-ment stronger and more actively obeyed than when the British troops landed in the East. The nation gave all that wa, demanded, and were assured that what they gave was sufficient. Englishmen presumed to interfere with.their rulers only as politicians, and inever as administrators. Every gener:al was appointad, every department was organized, asAt pleased a few men in authority; and it may be remarked, as an answer to those who now complain of 'the " system," and the inevitable unpreparedness of a' peaceful nation, 'that no word of warning was ever heard from any man in office. Ministers were complacent and wore an air of 'triumph, their military confidants talked loudly of the Peninsula, and the perfection to which that great school had brought the whvole arrangements of a British army. What wonder, then, that the public should believe in the efficiency so often asserted by 1hose who ought to know best ! The first narratives cf our correspondents were received by the Government not only with passive incredulity, but with high-toned and indignant denial. Th. milder 'Epithet of "exaggerated," since, .as facts have accumulated, softened down to "highlycoloured," was not then in vogue. It was 'all sheer malig:nant falsehood. As the month of December ada-vanced each post brought tidings more gloomy, and narratives of disaster more detailed and incontrovertible.- It was in these columns that the nation was told of the horrors of the camp and the hospitals, and hardly one of those statements but. was denied; and, indeed, they were so strange andc ghastly that the ready and confident contradiction of a ±nan in' ffMce might naturally carry conviction. Our readers have now, after a year's interval, the whole truth before them. The Report of the Com- Im;rioners,; and xti ,more thb evidended, on.wlich 'he report is but.- gentle comment, will4tell them r' all-mboretiin :tie press communicated;, nore than l:ty O c rrebponde could know.

Iw ;there one of .thlese things 'whichl is not now st,mped as true lay offcial authority? The various stories 'which' were' abroad now take tleir ' "Le' as facts; It' is no longer gossip that green coffee was served out to rnen when' there was not a bundle.of sticks 'within miles ..A nan can no lonier be laughed' at as a 1IUNenADSE2S who tells of horses eating each others' tails and manes,-nay, devouing their own horsecloths, from hunger. The story of the vegetables,' the story 'of the new brehd, the story of the. rice, the story of the limejuice, are not now among the inventions of a writer. whomwould be picturesque. Are they not written in the blue-boook which chronicles the confessiona of the British chiefs ? At the outset of the Commissioners' Report is recoraed one great faet. LIt wVi be remembered how the sickness prevalent in the army was said to be "exaggerated." 'One authority, whom -we are glad to have forgotten, proved statistically that the average number on the sick list did not exceed the usual percentage in the Peninsuilar war. Now hear Sir JomN 3rNxr :-" The deaths, including "those at Scutari and' elsewhere, appear to "amount to about 35 per cent. of the average "strength of the arniy present in the Crimea "from the 1stof October,'1854, to April 30th, "1855; and it seems clearly established that "'this excessive mortality is not to be attxi"buted to anything peculiarly unfavourable in "the climate, lut to' - overwork, exposure to wet "and- cold, improper food, insufficient Clothing "during part of the winter, tind insufficient ".shelter from inclement weather." We have nowv, on the highest authority, the terrible fact that more than one third of the British army actually perished in 'six months from causes uall of which might have been avoided. The number invalided, the number who have since last April gradually sunk from the effects of previously incurred disease, we 'know not; but we trust' that those who doubted one fact stated a year ago by. our correspondents, and pompously denied at home, will now be convinced.- It was said that much less than half of tlhe troops were in effective condition, and that those free from disease were merely a small fraction of the army. This was declared to be false; now let our readers decide, and say, if a third died, how many is it likely were'affectedby disease.. Some of the passages in the report are sad, and some are ludicrous, but we must content ourselves with a short notice. It is stated that there was never a'deficiency at Balakiava of the articles issned as rations 'to the. men. The next paragraph, however, is headed " Short Rations," and, as 'it most plainly; statbs 'that criain divisions were "fre" quently on three-quarters, two-thirds, and 'some"times on half-rations of meat and rum," that "on two occasions they had only quarter-rations, "and one day none at all," we are led to surnise some obstruction betwveen the riches of the harbour and the wants of the' camp. It is axplained under the heading " Land Transport," and we learn the " startling fact" that, though Commissary-General' Fu.nzx had considered it 'necessary'before the army moved from Varna that it should have 14,000 pack animals, there were actually present in the 'Crimea in January, 1855, only 333 horses or mules and 12 camels. Commissay-General 1ErrDE is certainly the most conspicuous figure in this, the iirst report, and there seems almost an inclination to maLe him responsible for not having done the duty of Commander-in-Chief and Quartermaster-General in addition to his own.' Although one-paragraph is candidly headed "No One Responsible " for Diet," yet poor MlYr. Fanus is with some art' continually represented, as saying and doing extraordinary things with a mixture of imbecility and pedantry. Thus it is stated that, though vegetables woula have prevented scurvy, yet the Co6nmissary-General declined to interfere in the matter, as one beyond the limits of his department, since in the Peninsula men gathered their own vegetables, while in MIalta and the colonies they buy them in: the market. The story of the new bread is also told -ith quiet humour. The men grew tired of biscuit; the sick, 'with their scorbutic gums, could not eat it-all wanted a little bread. There was flour, there were ovens and bakers, but on the part of the Commissary-General there was " an indispo"sition to make the attempt." "H He understood "that a floating, bakery had been for some months "in preparation in England, and it was considered "unnecessary or impossible to do anything till it "arrived." In spite of these anecdotes we cannot acquiesce in the attempt to throw the whole blame upon a Commissariat officer. Such a person is a man of business, and may be excused if he is somewhat a man of routine. There were others of higher stationi and more authority at whom the report points not ambiguously. We shall have more to say on this subject, but one thing may be mentioned. Ir. FinDmu was a man of great activity. Whether or not the result of it was successful, he was at Iis work early and late; he was to be seen riding about at all times and in all weathers. HIis appearance in the flesh was no strange sight to the camp' or Balaklava, while there were some whose presence among the suffering thousands would have beeh regarded as a prodigy.
A veryjbrief question and reply may be found hi oiir Parliamentary report of last night to which we woulcl call especial attention. As the quotation is not a Very long one, to save. all trouble, we will reproduce it here "Mr. EvTcMxSbeUGedtoasktho Socretaryof Statefor the Rome Department whether it %as the intention of the Government to nominate a select committee to consider the .best maode of estalishing a public road between Pirnlico and Pall-mal ? -Sir G. Gnr. said, two lfans with estimates had bee, prepared, and it wvas intended to movo the appointment of i committee to which they mnight be referme&" Thus, then, at least we have anived so far in the solution of this troublesome question that it has been fairly brought under the iiotice of rarliament. We shall be' extremely anxious to know the composition of the Seect Committee, for on that, of conrse, much will depend, but meanwhile e wvill content ourselves vnth the certainty that at leist a cclni de I)ain is no longer possible. 'The two plans to vijlch Sir GEoPsoG 'GnE' refers are,, we are told, as follows :-The ilrst is the old one for bisecting. the ornamerital garden, and a consequent communication between Marlborough-house and Queen-square, ar thereabouts. The second is the one which was proposed for adoptiou in the columLs of The Tines mauy months ago, whlen the question was 'frst mooted. It i6 siinplythata few iron gratinigs shoiud be temoved and a free: ciulation,perm,littea round the entire Park, as is already permitted along Birdcagelwklk. The only. alteration of any consequence -we mean by .that an alterati'n: involving: the expenditure of more than 201.--would 'be-that an entP should be made to 'the Park from' Trafalrsquare. We are by no means enamoured of our own idea, if any practical 3nau has anything beer to zuggest, but it inuxt;be bbviou.to any'ne who ts the' p tlhit the inemoval of a: I amngle house in SpD -ga2aeni and the'laying down - a suitableroad wld amit the *afficf eno1ugh. Thus, then, at Sto Buagte,atBuck-. 'ingham-gate,atMaborough-hose, orbythegtable, yarid, and at Spring-gardens vehidles might - pas friey n and out of the -Park witholit any mecessity for' expensive alterations. The 'four diitricts of the! town which are now separated by St. James's Park would be united, ihe beautiful garden would be preserved, the public convemence wouldbe consulted in the highest degree, and a most trfling expenditure would be incurred 'What occasion is there for tunnels, and engineering, anda-lasidh waste of the public m6ney? All this lbour' and ali this money would be more than thrown away-it woild be absolutely de-" voted to 'the wanton destruction of that' which is substantially public property. It- is difficult to conceiv6 that among rational men thete can be 'a moment's hesitation as to which is the preferable plan. From all quarters we have received letters upon this subject; indeed, to judge from this correspondence, there is far more interest upon the subject than on matterss of far greater moment. A 31inister may presume upon the patienkce and:forbeairance' of the public in many respects; but, if our correspondents are in earnest, we very sincerely Tecommend all persons who 'may be chargeda with the responsibility of this affair either to let tbings remain as they are, 'or, if an alteration is to be made, to consult the convenience and wishes of the Londoners. The simple fact of the case is that this has been made a Court question by the hangers-on about. the Palace. They believe-and, we doubt it' not, believe wrongly-that they will recommend themselves to. the 'good graces 'of the' SovmErGN by maintaiWg the inviolability-of St. James's :Prk. If they ever moved out of their own small circle, or drew one breath of free' air' like their fe'lowmortals, they would be somewhat startled at. the amount of unpopularity they are calling forth by their 'pertinacious endeavour .to keep a spot private which must of necessity be public by the mere development of the town. 'When Belgravia was not, when Kensington was out of town, and not a vestige existed of that palatial city whvich now stretches away for miles southerly and westerly of St. James's Park, it was all well enough to deal with St: James's Par'k as with a private garden. The case is now entirely different. Our Sovereigns have elected to fix their town residence in the heart of London. Be it so. Englishmen and Englishwomen and English children can never be an unacceptable sight to English Sovereigns.' Surely 'the repsentatives of the people have not been wanting in respectful acquiescence in all their demands, nor in the loyalty of profusion. A 'stately Palace has been erected for their convenience;' wings have grown out from the main building; a magnificent court ha3 been enclosed; fresh ground has been taken in for approaches and entrance-courts; leases have been purchased and houses knoc'ked donwn fact, has a demand been made which has not been instantly complied with! Has a wish been fonued which has not rather been anticipated than immedintely gratified ' After all, it is for a very 'brief period in each year that the Court is: in town, anrd even when this happens the apartments occupied by the Quxi are at the back of the Palace, overlooking a pleasant garden, into which not a murmir' from the Park can penetrate. If we thought 'that by' the remotest possibility the change proposed could cause inconvenience to the Royal Lady who holds the sceptre of these realms, we should be the first to oppose it with whatever power we have. The case, however, is' notoriously- otherwise. It signifies no more 'to the QuEZ,- that traffic should pass along the MMall than that it actually passes along Birdcage-walk. An abuse, however,- is made of the Royal name; blame is attributed where none attaches, and all this because it pleases certain gentlemen to conceive that they recommend themselves to the Royal favour by excluding the pubEc from St. James's Park; or, if the nuisance must be tolerated, by destroying, the gardens in which the Londoners take so much delight. We cannot dismiss the subject wvithout mentioning one ludicrous incident which has been brought out in the course of the discussion. It was proposed. to maake a tunnel on each side of the Dake of YoRx's pillar, so as to lead the traffic from Pall-mall into the Park uncder ground. It -was found, however, that his7 oyal Highness would be in innminent peril if the idea were persisted in, so this plan was given up. Now, it so happens that this mound of earth, which is now in our way, which involves the necessity of a flight of steps, and -which is a positive disfigurement to the neighbourhood, was absolutely carted there at the expense of many thousands of pounds some years ago. The view dowvn Regent-street into St. James's Park would have been beautiful but for thin unfortunate nuisnce of our own creation.

ADELPHI THEATRE. The pretty little storyof tteo ildren rmning from home in the hope of reaching Gretnagreen which is (jve eelieve) universally voted the gem of the Chxistmss mnu r of Householtd Wore[4, has been cleverly dramatized for the Adelphi Theatre, where it-was produced Last night. The tale is so arnged that the unaginary traveller, who is "snowed up" at the Holly-trce Inn, hears frorA the "boo's" the story of the intiait lovers at home before the elopement. takes place, and then becomes the witness of their arrival and separation at the hostelry. Thus the introductory part of the Holly-tree collection is blended with the particular story selected for theatrical representation. The part of Cobbs, the " boots," is played by Mlr. Webster with all that gusto which he exhibits whenever he has a part of strongly marked and congenial character to'delineate. Assuming that our readers are well-acquainted with the narrative in its original form, we must still remind thems that Cobbs is placed in a state of considerable moral peVety by the outzageous eccentricities of the two children. His perfectly aware that a gentleman of eight and a lady of seven are not- exactly the sort of persons to enter into the holy state of matrimony, and therefore communicates their fli^ht to the parents of the youthful bridegroom; but, at the same time, he is the :chosen confidant of the tender pair, and hence he has an uneasy notion that he is guity of consurimmate baseness in betraying them. The contendin- emotions are admirably portrayed by Mr. Webster, ;who now stares with unfeigned adniration at the courageous deportment of "Master Harry," now cajoles the children with kindness, the more insidious because it is sincere, now fairly bubberswhen he reflects on his own abject ysnsition. And, thirough ial his variations he never loses sight of the rustic character, vith the loutish peculiarities for which he is made up to perfection. The little piece is entitled the Roots ae the Holly-tree Inn, and, *ef course, has beenx construicted for the purpose of mahiug 7boots"'pre-eminent; but the smaler.arts, a,thou o patively unimportant, are all excelently filled r. Bar sehle, as tle" snowed up" gentleman, determined to mako the best of it under favourable circumstances, and amused with watehing the progress of the infantine amour, is Tather a spectator than ain agent in the story; but he does himself great credit by the natural ease of his by-play. The landlady, bannaid, and chambermaid, who are so wrapt in aauii- ation at the precocious spirit of "Master Harry," and weep with such sympathetic tears at his separation from the charming £iittle Norah, are sketched off in a lifelike manner by Misses Le Lacheur, Laidlaw, and Thompson; and for the younn folks, who are nominally the hero and heroine of the story, there are two remarkably well-trained children, Miss Craddock and Miss Mannin" 'The scenes, representing first theexterior of the inn, with 41 its-snowyquauications, andthenthelarge, comfortleseroom, withi heavy curtains and scanty furniture, accurately correspond to the description in Housdhotd Words, and we could not have a more perfect instance of a story taken out of a book, and placed npon a stage.

George Palmer, solicitor, an(d brother of Mr. William Palmer, the examination was deferred until the foUowing day, to give an OpDo: tunity for other medical gentlemen to be present on behalf of the prisoner. Accordingly on Saturday 3orning, at 10 o'clock, the Mgse motem, examination was recommenced by Dr. Monckton and the other medical gentlemen, Professor Bolton and Mr. Pemberton, of Birmingham, being also present; at the request of theprisoner's solicitor. Both the Iody and the cofiin exhibited marls of decomposition and decay; but we understand that the spinal cord (which was alone tie object of investigation, and not the brain, which had heen previously examined), was in a state of preservation which allowed a full and proper examination of its wheoe length. TLe spine was entirely free from disease. We believe that the healthy appearance presented by the brain and upper part of the spinal marrowonthesrst exsaination war the reson whichle the medical icentmemen to deem it unnccesry to exanine the whole of the spinal cord on tbat occasion.

I" It is believed that they are accepted."' EXPRESS FROOM PARIS. The following is the Ietter of 'our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. _ IV de Bourqueney received at Vienna on the 31st his official nomination as Plenipotentiary to the Conferences of Paris. He is expected here on FWday or Saturday next. The following list of Plenipotentiaries is now given as authentic and definitive -For France, Count Colonna Walewski and Baron de Bourqueney; for England, the Earl of Clarendon and Lord Cowley; for Austria, Count Buol-Schauenstein and Baron Hubner; for Turkey, Aali Pasha and Mehemed-Djemil -Bey; for Sardinia, the Chevalier M1assirno d'Azeglio; and for Russia, Coint Orloff and Baron Brunow. The Conferences, as I observed yesterday, are hardly expected to last a month, and the armistice will be for two months. Count Duol is expected at Paris soon. The arrangements at present existing are that the Plenipotentiaries are to take up their quarters at their respective Embassies. Instructions have been received by Al. Seebach, who is charged with the affairs of the Russian residents, to prepare the Hotel of the Russian Embassy for CountOrloffand Baron Brunow. It wasnotknown at Vienna on the 31st in generally well-informed quarterm whether Prussia would or would not be admittedto the Conferences ; or that she would give in her adhesion to the propositions of the allies as the condition of her admission. It was believed at Vienna that the principal object of Austria in laying these propositions before the Diet was to give Prussia an opportunity of declaring her intentions. The representatives of the allied Powers at Vienna met on the night of the 31st at the Foreign-office, preparatory to signing the protocol the following, day. The following letter frora Jassy (Moldavia), dated the 22d January, has been received:- " The law of emancipation of the slaves in Moldavia preo scribes that slavery exists no longer in the Principality, and that every man who stands on Moldavian ground is free. The indemnity for ransom of the Trigain is £xed at 8 decats, for the Lingourari (makers of wooden spoons), the Vatzaches (domestic slaves), and for the Lucches (nomad) at 4, without distinction of sex This law accords a certain favour to the ow-ners of slaves who give them freedom without claiming the indemnity fixed and payable by the State. Thus, by a clause of the organic regulations, the Trigains so freecdwill be received into the clas of the Chrysobolitc, that is to say, they wiL be exempt in this quality from all tribute for the first generation, and for 10 years from the old coree for the State. - " Contrary to supposition Prince Ghika has encountered warm opposition on this subject. A memorial, addressed to Constantinople, does not attack the measure, which in itself is opportune and founded on reason, but disputes the power of the Prince and his adiinistrationto effect it. He is reproached with having established new imposts. His right to do so is denied when there is no general assembly sitting. The Divan assembled ad hoc is stated to have no legal right to make laws and to confirm the decisions of the Prince so far as they refer to rights of property, and fears are expressed lest thesame counciwhose powers should be limited to simple administrative control, may go further and promulgate an agrarian law. The opposition is perhaps exaggerated, and we are not sure that the complaints of the memorialists will be taken into consideration at Constantinople. They are founded onthis,thatthetreatyoflBalta. Liman, aid with it the Divan itself, is annulled by the fact of the declaration of war of the Porte against Russia, and that, consequently, the country cannot be governed legally otherwise than on the basis of anterior rights, which have been recently confirmed bythe pr6clamations of the Pashas and the Imperial Commissioners. The friends of Prince Ghika will not fail to support him, while he himsef maintains that he is perfectly justified in what he has done, and tha' both he and the Divan were competent to establish new imposts and frame new laws. "In point of fact, the imposts, which are without im. portance, were proposed by the municipalities, to whom the organic regulation accords the right of demanding them in case of urgency. In trth, the Prince and the Divan only ask for the stamp duty and the donative paid out of the conventual revenues. The former is as yet only projected; the second is under consideration at Constantinople. The reproach is then unfounded. As to the emancipation of the slaves it can only be regarded as an act of humanity and justice. "From information that has just reached, it would ap. pear that Prince Ghika has not been deceived in his antici. patious; the Sublishe Porte has just confirmed, by an Imperial S3rman, both the legality and the propriety of all the acts of his administration. The law of emancipation regu. lates the mode of indemnity to the owners of slaves, aud enrolment of the emancipated in the class of taxc-payers. Manys of the Boyards of Moldavia, such-as licholas Kataiji, Pierre Voissa, Emmanuel Argyropulo, &c., have refused al indemnity from the State, and have sent in the lists of the laves they have freed. " The Wallachian Government has, in imitation of Prince Ghika, also decreed the abolition of slavery, but the law will not be put in execution for a year after the sanction of the Sultan has been obtained." A, letter from Frajova, of the 11th of January, says- "On Christmas night X Eliontza Keutusko, a rich Boyard, who inhabits a detached house in a faubourg of the to(wn, was suddenly asailed by some soldiers of the Austrian army. They broke into his house after a struggle with the servants, who were soon got the better of, made prsoners, i and beaten, and reduced to ilence. Meantime two of the anlefactors, guided by a native, ascended to the first story, and entered the apartment of the Boyard, where he was with his wife and adopted son. At the ap. proach of the assailants the lights were extinguished, and the poor woman crept under the bed to hide herself, while the son escaped by the blck stsirs, and the niasterof the house, who was ill of gout, remained in his bed. The soldiers pured the youth, throw him down in the court-yatd, bea. bim, and left lim to the care of an aacoqmplice, who held him down on tho ground by imeoing on his chest. The other ruBaus dzAgead the unfortunate woiu froSm -rei fhoe' bea, kab ddmeiumd her eimoey odl bhec life'.

The4 lWniMadt publishes the following letter, datedaielsingfors, in Finland, 22d ult.:- - " Prepas'atins a re being mide throughout our country to eclebrate the .700th anaiversiry of the introduction of Christianity into Finland. .

The Emperor yesterday gave audienee to M. de Baumbach, who delivered to His Mbjesty his letters of credenceasMinister-Plenipotentiaryof the Elector of Hesse. A letter from St. Louis (Senegal) of December21, in the Moniteucrde la 12ofte, gives an account of an exploring voyage made by the Governor, attended by a numerous party, to the Lake Pani&Foulh. The following are some details:- " They left St. Louis in the Government steamer Guet'ndar, and ascended the mAin river for about 25 leagues, and then entering a small branch arrived at the lake, which is about eight leagues in length and with an average breadth of half a leagne. The steamer, after passing Merinaghem, a Frenchpost established nearthe entranceofthelake,proceeded four leagues beyond it as far as the tamarind plantation of Bournoun, when, from the shallowness of the water, it was considered prudent not to venture further. Bournoun is the point of junction of the Cayor, the Walo, the Fonta, and the Djioloff; it is the rendezvous of bands of robbers who intercept the communications and ma!e razzias on the neighbouring countries. At this place the lake is nothing morethan an immense river, having near its edges vast tracts of rice grounds. The arrival of the steamer produced an immense sensation among the natives of the villages on the banks of the lake, and the Governor was a witness oz the excellent effect produced by the energetic measures which he had adopted against the Moors. All along the banks of the Taive and of the Walo the villages have again submitted to the orders of the chiefs appointed by the French. The dominion of the Moors is now at an end, and the inhabitants begin to feel the advantages which will result to them from the protection of France, and they read with every mark of respect and admiration a proclamation which the Govemor had caused to be distributed among them, assuring them of his protection. The steamer returned to Senegal by another river,whichleads fromthe lake ss far as the Ile aux Biches, where it fallsinto the river St. louis." Commercial accounts are generally of a satisfactory nature. Confidence in the re-establishment of peace has' induced the manufacturers to renew their stock of raw materials, and engage additional hands, and the shopkeepers to layin a fresh supply of goods, in the hope of ready and profitable sale. Commission agents are now visiting the ind.ustrial districts, maldng purchases for spring. hIany demands have also reached from abroad, and some silk manufacturers of Lyons have even received direct orders from Russian houses. The retail trade however continues langaida; consumers only buy as their necessitiesrequire, and the numerous class of persons having small salaries or limited incomes, are obliged, from the high price of provisions, to submit to privations and live with the strictest economy. It is hoped, however, that the decEline in the price of corn, which is now general, will produce a corresponding fall in that of the other necessaries of life, and that the lower branches of trade will benefit by the reaction. The impos sibility in which speculators found themnselvesto dispose of theirflour duringthe last fortnight, caused the downward movemneatto continue onthe Paris market during the week. The best sorts, which, eight days ago, were held at lOOf. and lOOf. 50c. per sack of 157 kilogrammes, now only fetch from 9Sf. WOc. to 96f. The arrivals are numerous from all quarters, and the stock remaining in the hae on Saturday was 33,600 metrical quintals. Whet is alsolower, good qualities from Lorraine and Burgundy selling from MOf. to 50f. 50c. the 120 Idlogrammes.' In the de. partments, out of 48 markets the prices of 43 haTe arrived with a fall, and most of them were abundantly supplied. At Havre many orders for 'Ame. rican wheat and flour have been recalled, in antieipation of a' considerable decline in the United States, when it becomes known that the Russian ports are about to be thrown open. There is no change in either the cattle or wime market. Rumours of peace, which tend to depress other articles, have not affected the price of brandies, owing, no doubt, to the new opening the Russian market will afford.

In the course of the evening it was settled that the Representatives of England, France, Turkey, and Russia should meet at the Foreign office at 12 to-day, and then and there sign the important document in question. At the appointed hour the four foreign diplomat*sts* had assembled, and they and Count Buol attached their signatures to the subioined protocol:-- " Par suite de lIacceptation parleurs Cours respecisis cinq propositions renfernees dans lo document ci-annexe, sous lo titre de projet des pr6liminaires, les soussignes, aprss 1'avoir paraph6, conform6ment a lautorisation qu!ils ont regus a cet effet,sont convenus que leurs Gouvernements noromeront chacan des .Plenipotentiaires qui, munis des pleins pouvoirs necessaires pour proceder a la signature -des preliminaires do paix formels, concluerout un arnistice et i un traite de paix dCfinitif.

" In these two years of war with four Powers, the Russian people has given a striking proof of its great and noble cha. racter, and has eamed the respect of its enemies. " As regards France it may be positively affirmed that the French nation loves and respects the Russians, admires their courage and self-denial, and takes every opportunity of expressing its sympatlhy, as it did when there was a short suspension of hostilities in the Crimea, as also when Russian prisoners passed through France. The French prisoners, on their part, have been treated by the Russians like brothers. " May God grant us peace. But, should it notbe concluded, Russia still has at her disposal sufficient means of resistance to repel her enemies with energy. We hope, at all events, that peace will give a new impetus to Russiau trade and manufactures, which will completely emancipate Russian commerce from strangers. " Every strong Power, even during peace, should be constantly prepared for war. :Russia desires peace, but she does not fear wAr." ITALY. We read in the Opinione of Turin, of the 2d inst.:- " Piedmont having adhered to the treaty of alliance concluded between England, France, and Turk-ey, has the same right as those Powers to participate in the Peace Conferences. Her right is even paramount to that of Austria, which confined herself to sign an eventual treaty on the 2d December, 1854. At the Congress of Vienna, the degree of participation to- the negotiations on European questions was determined, not from any consideration of the greatness of the Power, but in proportion to the part each had acted in the previous general events. Our right is also founded on the following articles of the Convention of the 10th of April, 1854, and the act of adesion of Sar. dinia,dated 26th January, 1855 :-' Article Im What. ever events may occur in consequence of the execution of the present convention, the high contracting parties bind themselves to receive no overture or proposition tending to the cessation of hostilities, and to enter into no arrangement with the Imperial Court of Russia, without haring previously deliberated upon them in common. Art. V. Their Majesties the Emperor of the French and the Queen of the United lKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland will readily admit into their alliance, in order to eo-operate to the attainment of the proposed end, such of the other Powers of Europe as may wish to enter it.' The act of adhesion says-. '.The Minister of Foreign Affairs of His Sardinian Majesty, &c., decares that the Ring of Sardini aecedes by the present act to the above convention, that is, to the clauses the object of which has not yet been accomplished, &c. If any previous contrary decision had been adopted, which we have proved not to be the case, the previsions of the more recent treaty just quoted would suffiee to remove every doubt. The objection raised; by the eorrespondent Y,' of the Im1dpMcdan Be Ege is consequently unfounded, and imust be regarded ss a pitiful attempt made by some ! Power interested in excluding Piedmont from the negotiations-a PowerwhichcanneitherbeEnglancleorPrance,who are,onthe contrary, interested inheradmision, because itse- I cures to them a voice the more for the settlement of the questions under deiberation, otherwise it would be a mere .2erminiseence of tho well-known antipathies against Italy en - tertainedin the Foreign-Offoceof Frauoe, when it was piaed inder the direction of Messrs.

'On the very'spot on which thi church stands, she, accord. ing to the legend, was miraculousy 'protected fromntheinsults of two drunicen soldiers, by her hair suddenly growing so as to cover her entirely as ix. imnpenetrable armour. The -Academy of the Propaganda in honour 'of the Epiphany held its annual f&tc of languages on the 15th and 14th. Theostensible object of thesefats is to'celebrate in poetry and prose, in all the languages of the world, the mystery of the adoration of the MAgi; but, in order to avoid the mnonotony-of'the same subject treated year after year for centuries,. one 'of the most strikink religious events of the year is selected.- Thns, -last year, the adoption of the dogma of the Immaculate' Conception 'was celebrated, azid this year the subject chosen Was the providential escape of the Pope, the Cardinals} And the -pupils of the Propaganda in the accident on the 12th April in the' monastery of St. Agnes. This interesting subject Was treated with a good deal of spirit and variety. The first poem read was in Hebrew, and dwelt on the joy of Satan at the danger of the Pontiff and the pupils. The slcond was a hymn in ancient 'and modern Chaldean on -the saving of the Pope. Then were recited- in succession a prayer of the fallen in Syriac; an expression of ' Eternal gratitude,' in Axmenian; 'Fulness of the heart,' by an Arab; 'Presents of therescued missionary,' by a Chinese; the' )De lightful spectacle of the Pontiff and his companions being saved,' in Georgian; ' the annual procession in memory of the accident of the 12th April,' by. aperuivian; 'Two visions showing Satan preparing his vengeauce,' by a Kurd; the 'Souvenir of the Rescue,' by 'a Hindoo; ' Satan tiying from the rnms of St. Agnes, when disappointed ivhis hopes,' by a Turk; ' Three presents from his brethren,' by a native of the Soudan; and lastly, -two Cophts of. Memphis and Thebes sang the ' Praises of the Lord, who consolesZion andrepairsallitsruins.' In addition to these productions in the languages of Asia and Africa, 18 in niunber, 22 others in the languages of Europe, commencing bynmodernGreek and ending by Italian, were delivered. The French poem was, however, not in accordance with the programme-its theme being the ' Sisters of Charity.'" THE- PENINSULAR MAILS. SOTITHANPTON, .TUESDAKY 3Iomrnr;. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam ship Sultan, Captain R. W. Evaus, arrived early this morning, with the Peninsular mails in charge of Lieutenant Herniin, R.N., Admiralty agent. The Sultan's dates are Gibraltar, Jan. 29; Cadiz, 30; Lisbon, Feb. 1; Oporto, no communication; Vigo, Feb. 2. There are on board 18 first and second class passengers, including Mr. G. Ronnie and family, Governor of the Falkland Islands, and 40 deck passongers. On freight the Sultan bringsl0packagesof specie, value 3,3081., and a cargo consisting of 862 halfchests of oranges, 175 cases of eggs, 18 casks of wine, 11 tubs of leeches, 65 bags of almonds, 780 bags of chestnuts, 103 bags of orchila weed, 79 boxes of dates, and 23 packages of general merchandize. During the outward voyage, the Sultan experienced heavy south-west and westerly gales to Lisbon, after which fair weather. On the homeward voyage, the weather was favourable, enabling this mail packet to average Ili knots from Lisbon to this port. The Sultan left Lisbon on the 1st instant, three days behind her time. The foreign vessels of war in the Tagus were Her Majesty's ship St. George, and the French steamer Cameleon, which had put in the day before for coals. The exchanges for thispacket are quoted-London, 54 ; Paris, 521 ; Amsterdam, 43k; Hamburg, 48,'; Genoa, 518 to 520; with little money and paper over on London; and on the continent transactions were very limited.

The events. tuirned out as I anticipated, and by a far larget minority than any one, expected. )fr.

Mr. Kae polled1,588, his 'majority being thuta 1,129. This result. is the more remarkable, . as Mr. Rae's opinions are so crude 'and =ipracticable that he had really but little to recommend him to an intelligent constituency, and I am quite correct in saying that 'the majority voted to keep Cruikshank out, and not to put Pm: in. The squatters, as you are awae, have hai uninterrupted possession of the lands of the oolonyj for years, at very low license, fees. In 1846 ihe Hlome Governmen;t framedi oertain regulations by which the squatters were;to have. 8 and 14 years'. leases. These leases have nererbeengiven; but' they have had .possession nevertheless. From time,. to time very insignificant portions of the pastura. lands, have been sold for agriculturl purposes, in alL I scarcely exceeding- ,500,000 acfesinlA parts of the colony. As population increaes more wi be required, and the. squatters modestly demand eom-ou pensation to the extent of 2,500,000l. Their votea!i in the Council, whether for the Government. or. against it, have almost invariably been governed by their own interest. They have often' thrown their, weight (about a dozen votes) into the Government scale, when they fancied the Executive'was disposed. to favour their views ; and they have-hitherto beea not without hope, that the , Government would support the principle of compensation. In t.hat case their majority would have been two to one. But the Government has used them, and. has no further. occasion for them. It has now nothing to gain-anuc all to lose by encouraging the views of the squatters, and this election effectually defeats their grand. object-namely, to get their claims recognized :-by! this Council, a councilof 14 officinls and 9 nominees But this would be too indecent a matter for. the members of the Government, and their claims, wili be a legacy for tlLe new Parliament. . .. The Legislature now stanas tumrmoned for 'the' 23d of November for the. despatch of business, on 'which day the newConstitultionwillbeproclaimed. The chief business of the last ession will be to pas an electoral act for the registration of voters, and so forth. . I believe there is a pretty general under'standing amongmembersnot to enter into new measures, and especially -not to attempt to fetter tba new Assembly-a 'wise resolve, seeing that the. new Assembly 'wouldnot be fettered by amongrel House so composed. It is -'rumoured that the House will at only six months' supplies, as the Government ~rm e.sily provide for the assembhing of the new ssembly and Counc,il within.that period. There is a quiet under current of agitation setting in, i favour of the voluntary principle, and agamst the reserre of . 50,000!. for ministers of religion,> which 1 think likely to lead to rery inportant resulits. It isnot the work of demagogues, or of ambitious gentlemen who wish to make out of it alittle politicmi capital, but is conducted by grave, sober men, well placed in the world, both by character and means-a very important consideration here, 'where wealth is an object of superstitious devotion-and who, when they take up a question with energy, are not liely to put it aside -until carried. The Iudependents, a most respe&table body in all these colonies, have invariably refused State aid; the Presbyterians and Wesleyans are disposed to dispense with it. The Episcopalians are. divided upon it. The Roman Catholics, strange to say, having tasted its sweets, have become attached'to it. It would not surprise mne if it were to become -the question of quesons at the nevr elections.. It nmay take a few years to train the publc mind on the subject, but I am convinced that " State aid toreigion," as it is here called, is doomed. It ay be doubtf, in the first instance, whether the semi-saviae portion of our population will b'e'disposed to contriute towards the support of theirewnministerve but'the public opinion ofsthe circle aroundthemii cll soonmakethem do so. The 50,000. isonly 3s. 4d' a-headfor the whole population-an average essily raised, 'were it nofr that every one nog considers he is exoneratedt from private contribution by the Etate sulport. The Independents, wlho do notaccept aid, have no difflcultyin raising funds h y voluntary contibutions. The Church of Ealand, 'whichd takes at least 25,000e. out of the reserved fond, are by no means successful in thleir private collections. Even at the very source of wealth, Ballnrat, the English church. -in spite of a grant of land and of a contribdtion forthe building-couldnot raise moey onthe spot, and the committee came begging here; while the. Independent chapel close boy was built entirely by subscriptions on the spot, and is finished before "the church" is half up. I doubt whether, self-, reliance on the part of the chnrches 'will ever be . generated SOIong as the mnsters are paid quarterly; and, if so, the first stepa t he properd orking of the voluntary principle is to adopt it, The Ballarat riots seesn to have impressed many people at home with a notion that this colony is ripe for revolution; but, depend upon it, there is no suce danger, eunless "chrs. other Country" drive the members of the L pegislature to, mov,e in the 'matter, and then the Ballarat rowdies would be an emements. in, the question. The election of mayor takes place to-day, and the the choice will fall on John Thomas Smith, the present mayor, who has thrice filled the offlce; hence,he is sometimes designated as the Australean hhittin,gton. I do not linow that the choice coul fall on a better an It is true hemade his money by keeping apublic house, and one not of the highest class obutmany of our "potent, grave, and reverend siniors" did that, and the' town-couicillors and: aldermen are necessarily, as in.England, 'takent from the trading class, 'Mtr. Smit is, I beleve, very wealthe, and he is no niggard in his ex;penditure, and,!1 am well assured, most liberal in his charities. he devotes the 'whole of his time to the publis service, and is really a most exce,llent magistrate.

COA70CATION. TO THE EDITOJR OF THE TiMES. Sir.-May I be permitted to draw attention to the very inmportant conclusions arrived at in the sitting of the Con. vocatioe of the Clergy of the Province of Canterbury on Friday Wts5t For the last four years efforts have been made to obain a revival of the legislative functions of that body tinder the sanction of the Crown, while there have been also unsucceswful endeavours snade by a minority of the ConvcAtion to obtain the recognition of a lay clement as an -essential condition of such zevivaL The decision of the Bishops of the Upper House to put an end to this conflict -wilt be hailed by all true friends of the church possessed of ~sufficient intelligence to apprehend that there are grave practical questions before us urgentlyrequiring an early settlement. Henceforth we shaU meet as a "consulting yody"Soe1y -and there is every prospect that before the 15th of April-the day appointed for our next session-a measure will be ready to be laid first before the Crown and then before the national Legislature which, emanating from a committee composed of the most temperate and judiciotLs of the. dignified and parochial cergy, will reconmeand itself to tho Legislature of the nation as a sui4ble means of restraining those aberrations from clerical decency and from souna doctrine, of which too many insances have recently attracted attention. Not the least grtifying fact is, that in secking a remedy for a pressing evil the bishops have not only exhibited a rare and becoming moderation in conceding to the lower clergy the initiative of a measure which, if adopted by the legislature, will tend to sihinplify and cheapen the correction of the clergy (whether bishops, priests, or deacons), but have solved the confessedly difficultproblem of the admission of the hy element, by recopizing the three estates of thc rlmanaa the power which is to give effect to the decisions of our provincial synod.

"The Bntish oldier usualyK sao'es in his knaussek clothing sufficent to aamint of &'leaat. one change, but oe lauding in the Crimea, so greatwasthe anxiety to advanoeg rapidly upon Sebastopol, that suthority was given to leave the lwnaps&cks in the transports,. andof this permisionmost of tho corps appear to have xaailed themselves. - Generally, therefore, each soldier had only a slhirt, f^ pair-of boots, and a psir.of socks, loosely rolled sp in his blanket; and even of these a great part wa8 lost at. the battle of the Alma, or during the march.- This earation from tho knapsacks could have- produced but little inconienience had it terminaed with th!e march; - but5 unfortunately, they were left on board of -tho different vessels -fronm which the men had disembarked. and.these, being urgently required to bring reinforcemnents ahd supplies, wero sent to the opposite coast, carrying the napsacks with them. It appears from the evidence that, on the average, more than sis weeks elapsed before they WTere re4oyred, ind then, in many case, only after they had been plundered of a great part of their contents. The vAElissof tS e cavalr', which were likewise left behind, shared the samo fate, and tho great majority of the troops were thus depri.ed, for a considerable time, of a change of 'lothing.i '" Had the whole of the knapsackas and valises been collected under a proper guard; in one or two vessels selected for the purpose, and insructed to proceed along the coast till the army arrived before Sebastopol, no bad effocts would probably havo res dted from! an arrangement which enabled .the men to lighten the fatigue of the murch; but for want of this precaution, the troops, with few:exceptions, had to commence the siego operations, in the beginning of Octo'ber, with hardly any clothing beyond what they had on. The *ork ib2 trenches is peculiarly destruetive, and tho soldier's unifomi wam soon reduced to a throadbare and tUttered condition. This separation from their knapsacks not merely affected the comfort of the soldier, but was in a great measure the cause of the wretched and destitute state in which the sick and wounded arrived at Scutari, as referred to in the report on the State of the Hospitals of the Anny in the East. .,In such a place as Balaklava nothing could be purchased for the re-equipment of the soldier; he could neither wash nor change his clothes. His person consequently became covered with vermin, and where affections of the bowels prevailed, as was almost universal, the shirt rotted from filth, and had generally to be cut off his back when taken into hospital at Scutari. "A As a soldier usually takesintollaspital, in his knapsack, everything that is required for keeping his person in a state of cleanliness, no sufficient preparations had been made at Scutari to meet the demands for slhirts and under-dothing of the thousands who arrived in this destitute condition. There was also a great want of knives, forks, and spoons, as it was the usual practice for the soldier to bring these along with him. II It is necessary to trace this accidental destitution to its true oause-viz., the separation of the men from their knap. sackse, otherwise it might be supposed of an event of ordinary occurrence, arising from defective equipment, whereas no troops can be betterprovided in this respect than the British army. " It will be seen from the evidenco of Colonel Gordon, then Assistant Quartermaster-General, that he attributes the non-recovery of the knapsacks at an carlyperiod to the general officers of divisions, with the exception of the Duke cf Cambridge, preferring not to receive them. On referring, however, to two of tho officers who commanded divisions on that occasion, one of them states positively that no such offer was made tohim ; anotherthat he has no recollection'of it, though it may have been so; the third being absent, we have had no opportunity of communicating with him on the subect. "1 Mot of the knapsacks, with such of their contents as could be recovered, were restored to the troops bv the iniddle of* November. In a meteorological register kept at Bslaklava, it is stated that till then the weather was generally fine, with little rain, but that, during the latter part of that month and a considerable portion of December there were heavy rains with cold nights. From the time of his landing in the Crimea the soldier had the ordinary field equipment of a greatcoat and blanket, which up to Decem'ber appears to have been sufficient f6r warmth; but he suffered much discomfort from remaining constantly, for more than six weeks, in the same clothes, occasionally wet, vwithout the means of changing them; and it is not improbable that the seeds of disease may thus, in some cases, have been sown. . What-he- principally suffered from, however, during the early part of the winter appears to have been the want of something, besides his blanket, to lay under him on the ground of his tent, which, after heavy rains,was dcamp or muddy. WAR.IRM CLOTHMG FROt MTGLAND.- "Exclusive of the Artillery, for whom.separate warm clothing was provided, the whole 'force in the Crimea, at the end of November,-appears to have been about 23,000 or. 24,000, and the supplies lvlich had arrived from England in the end of November and beginning of December, for the purpose of equipping thein with clothing suitable for the winver, were. as under:Frocks, woollen and flanrAel, 80,400; drawers,-ditto, 35,500; stockings and socks, 69,056; Mtiltia trousers, G,000 ; bilitia coats, 5,934 ; great coats, Line-pattern, 8,300 ; watch cl6aks. or coats, 5,075; blankets, 24,025; rags; 13,975; paillasses, 20,000; bolster cases, 4,000; ammunition boots, 29,840 ;aud shoes, 5,S20. "1 Had all these supplies come safely to hand, they would' have furnished about three woolles frocks and three pairs of socks or stockiugs, as well as half that proportion of drawers, and an extra blanket to each man. There were also enough of rugs, paillasses, and greatcoats, or watchcloaks, to have fumnished, ebout one of each for every two men, wvhich would have been sufficient; because, owing to the duty to be.performed, only a proportion of the mencould be in their tents at the same time. "Unfortunately, the Prince was fost on the 14th November with all her supplies, but an officer- was immediately despatched by Lord Raglan to Constantinople for the purpo3e of making purchases to replace them, who succeeded in obtaining the quantities specified in a list given in the appeni. "wAunt CLOTo NG FROx CONSTANTXOPLM * Of these, a portion was sent over immediately by the Brandon, the Valorous, and the Sydney. The Queen of the South also arrived from Malta on the 18th of November with -further supplies, so that there -was. available for distribution in the- end of- November and beginning *of December (by which time the thermometer had not fallen below the freezing point) the following articles:Frocks, woollen and flannel, 35,082; drawers, woollen and flannel, 20,481; stockings and socks, 72,602; greatcoats, 12,175; watch-coats or cloaks, 2,6C0; blankets, 14,367; rugs, 10,325; paillasses, 11,450 ;- amunition boots, 18,600; shoes, 4,020; capotes and gregoes, 99S, comforters, 1%043; mitts, 8,724 miEtia trousers, 6,030; ditto coats, 5;934. " The quantity lost in the Prince, however, was so great is to leave the supply very inadequate for the wants of the for-e till the end of' December, by which time numerou's vessels arrivedviith large quantities of varm-clothing, botn from Eiigland and Constantinople. In the meanwvhile the supplies which had come to hand might have been applied to the protection of the troops, and wee shalL therefore, proceed to inquire whether steps were taken for that purpose.' " DISMIBUTION ofWARM CLOTING. " W-th the exception of some articles given out to two or threeregimentsin the endofNovember, theissueofthennderclothing, ceonsisting of woollen frocks, flanel drawers, and stockings or socks, as -well as about one-half of the trousers, comnmenced from the Quartermaster-Generalrs store in the first week of December, and at the same time a distribition of blankets also took place. These supplies, which were assigned to the regiments in quantities proportioned to their- umhers, afforded-about one suit of underclothing, including a pair of socks to each mr, with a blanket to everytivo men; On the-affival4of fresh -upplies in the beginningof January each man-aawcompleted with two suits .of under-clothing-aud socks, as bell as one extra blanlet. During the month of Decomber the severity. of the winter had much increased,- and, tho- inediel'-officers describe the sifferings of the. troops, - for- wnt of proper bedding, warm covering and, :clothing,- as - very serious.

"The only explanation -that has been offored to account for the n iisueo of those rugs is the statement of 14jor Wethierall,' that he' 6ccasionally mentioned to the QQuarteunMters of- different corps that thero¢were such thingsin store, and that theydeclined tadng-them.'. We cousld,not learn, however, from any vf. the Quartermastors ' wi,om we,l quest.oned on the spbject, or even from their £up)erior officers, that they were aware of the existeoico of. thcKse rugs; and certainly' it is 'not nnal to leave it to the Quartermaster of s corps to doberine what amount of covringthe soldiers shall have. He acts merely as the authorized receiver of the atores for the corps; and it is not easy to conceive on what grounds any officer could decline to ,receive these supplieg, which were of the best descrip. tion, at a 'tine when the men vere suffering seriouily from. the cold, and hd no means of keeping themsclics w' except by Ussing additional covenugs. - " When the intelligence of tho loss of the Prince anl of the increasing severity of the climate in the Crimea was received in England, additional supplies of blinkets were sent out. On the 24th and 27th of December two vessels arrived at Bilakava, bringing 25,000-a number which was more tlian sufficieni to havo given a third blanket to' every man. This would- have enabled him to have two dry blankets in his tent, besides the one which he generally brought in wet from the trenches, an arrangement which had been found very beneficial in tho Naval Brigade. '' It will be observed that.Colonel Gordon, in his evidence, assigns as a reason for the non-issue of many of these supplies, that he, conceived the men had enough, and ho enumerates a long list of articles supplied to them; but he orerlooks the fact that the greater numberof these wero not ismed till aboct tho end of' January or beginning of February, whereas the period during which the men principally suffered was in the months of December and January, when it appears that there vwere supplies enough in hand to have averted much of that suffering. - " The veasels before referred to, which arrived about the middle and end of November; had also broug,ht 21;450 paillasses, to protect the soldiers from' the moisture of the ground; of which, however, 10,000 were lost in thePrince. It vwas intended ihat they should be stuffed wvith ha or straw, but at-that time these were deficient in the camp; and no effort seems to have been mado to providoe sa substitute, though wool from the opposite coast might probably have been procured if proper measures had been taken for that purpose. Had oven the paillasso-sack, together with ono of the rugs in store, been issued, it would have affordod tho soldier some protection from the moisture of the ground, till a better bed could be procured for him; rnone of the paillasses, however, were issued to the troops, and of a subsequent supply of 6,000 only about one-half were used for the hospitals; the whole of tlereat remained in store. " It was not neceasary that thero should bo a paiUasse for eacl man, and, indeed, a tent could not have contained that number; one to every two men would have been sufficient, fornearly one-half were out on duty at night; and even in the end of November the number in store would have afforded that proportion. " GRFATCOATS. "By the end of November, or beginning of December, about 12,000 greatcoats also had arrived at Balaklava. Of these, there remained in store, during the months of Decem'he-' and January, when thoy wero most urgently required by the men, upwards of 9,000, besides nearly 2,000 watchcloak.s. These numbers would have furnishcd one to every two men, and, supposing one-half to be on duty, would have afforded to each man a dry greatcoat or cloak to put on when he returned to his tent from tho trenches, instead of lying dovn, as he often did, in one that vwas wet and muddy. " But it was not necessary to have waited even so late as 'the end of November to commence an extensive issne of additional greatcoats, for, in order that there might be a proper reserve in store of so essential an axticle of equipment, 10,000 had' been sent from England to Scutari so early as the monith of July; of these 3,325aonly were sent to Varna, and the' remainder lay in store at Scutari till the middle of December. There seems to be no'reason why these should net have been at Balaldava whenever the I approach of cold weather requized additional clothing; and, with the 11,000 which arrived in the end of November, they would have afforded ample covering at a comparatively early period for all tho men exposed on night duty; and oni the arrival, in the end of December, of the gregoes, or hooded greatcoats, purchased by Major Wetherall at Constantinople, every man might have been supplied either with one of these or a greatcoat. 'One of the reasons assigned for not issuing the regimental greatcoats was, that the regulAtions of the service, as established by- the Queen's warrant, did not authorize such issue more frequently than once in three years. The proportion of corps in the Crimea entitled to them in terms of that wvrrant was very limited, and itdoes not appear that any instructions dispensing with itsrestrictionswere received there, or that any intimation was given of the intention with - which they were sent out.I Had an applicatton been made, however, it is not probable that the General Commanding. would have refused to authorize, on his own responsibility, - thg distribution of articles of clothing which were likely to contribute to the health and efficiency of the troops, and if the Quartermaster-General doubted his own powers in this matter, it appeals to ns that he ought to have applied for that authority. '"'We havereferredto the Ordnance Department, through awhich these supples were sent to the Crimea, in order to ascertain whether any restriction was placed upon their issne. From the reply there appears to have been none, and that the whole were forwarded for the use of the army without any limitation or instruction on that head. " It does not seem to have occurred to the officers who were charged with the distribution of this clothing that so large a quantity of greatcoats conldhardly havebeen sent at one timo for the mere purpose of replacing such as were worn ont. Used only for that purpose, the number, amounting ultimately to 37,000, would have been sufficient for nearly five years; and the quantity constantly arriving might have convinced them that it was not intended to assign any other limit to the distribution than tliewants of the troops. No corps was likely to require the renewal of its greatcoats so unexpectedly as not to admit of their being sent from England, if the stores in Balaklavacould not furnish them. " It might, however, be expedient, when supplies the issue of which is regulated by Royal warrant are sent] out to be otherwise distributed, that some intimation to that :effect should be given, in order that officers may not be sub.- jected to any risk of personal and pecuniary responsibility by setting aside the authority of the warrant. " COATEES AND TROUSES.- "On the 28th of November the Ottawa had arrived at Balaiava, bringing 6,000 militia coatees' and 6,000 trouserx wMhich hadbeen despatched from Englaisd on receipt of intelligence that the clotning of the troops had suffered greatly from the operations of the siege. It might have been expected that thesevwould be distributed jimmediately, but the w'hole of.the coatees and one-half of the trousers were still 'in stOre six months aftertheir arrivaL The reason assigned was, that the Secretary7at-War's letter of theth Of Noh vember; l;4,. announced. 'the immediate shipment' of an extra suit of ' clothing for each soldier, but it is understood - that, for some of the corps, this clothing did not arrve in the Crimea til March, 1855. - "We are desirous to direct attention to the circumstaceI that the preceding observations, relating to the non-issue of warm or winter Clothing which was. available in the Crimea, refer exclusively to the interval between the end of: November, 18, when tho first supplies of thatdescription arrived, and the middle of January, l:s-4 period of about six weeks. After the latter date clothing and covering of every description arrived in such- quantities, that in the course of-a few weeks' the nen-,had mofe:thi enough'; buffalo robes' to -protect them 'from the moisture o.f the ground, sheepskin coat4 fur caps, waterproof- coats and leggings were all edin profusion, a elas . tnoe Yiie . upyof lor,g bcots Sita d to the -muddy. roads.snd zoi.of that couutry; ba btw'ehre the beginning of'Deo.emberxand the middle of January they Wrc"ceived nothing except the- wzirn under-clothing previously. imentioned, and about-3,QO pairs of troruses.

" 11 With this exception, the supply of boots and shoes appears to have been sufficient to meet the demand, notwithstanding the loss of 12,880 of the former, and 1,800 of the lattor in.tho Prince, but it is possible that difficulties may have occurred at first in the distribution, owing to some of the casks not having been packed in the usuat -manner. '- On tho 2d of December, being the earliest date at wlich we have any returns of the Quartermaster-General's stores, thero were on hand 15,382 pairs of ammunition boots; from 2,000 to 3,000 more were received into store in that month, while the numberissuedwasonlylO,329. InJanuaryupwards of 12,000 more were received; we cannot state exactly the, number issued, owing to the diffliculty of distinguishing between those sent to regiments and those which were merely transforred to the department of Kadikol, though 'entered as issues in the Quartermaster-Gcneral's returns bu't the large supply on hand is not likely to have been cxhausted in tho course of that month,- and the quantity received into store in February and the succeeding months was so great as to prevent the probability of any scarcity being experienced afterwards. " It' seems to bo doubtful wlhether any individual can be held responsible for the proper adaptation of such supplies to the particular service on which troops are engaged, or for the exercise of the foresight required to insure such adaptation. Nominally, that responsibility'rnay rest witl tho Secretary of State for War, but, praetically, it is impossible that he should attend to every such detaiL 4' S lorng as the men had to pay for their boots and shoos th!ere was a disinclination to purchase them from the public store, on acoount of their alleged inferiority in quality. Like all articles obtained bycontract from the lowest bidder, the vrrkmanship was bad, and totally unfit for endarance in the tenacious soil of the trenches, or for travelling along the muddy roads, in which the mien were often half-leg deep. Itis stated that, even when sufriciently large, they were altogether unsuited to resist the wet, and that the soles frequently came offin afew days. It was not until the arrival of hoots coming up to the knee, and of superior materials and workmanship, that the condition of the soldier appears to have been materially improved in this respect, or that hcwas able to do his duty without the discomfort aris. ing from being ill shod in such a soil. ' Similar complaints were made by the commanding officers regarding the quality, and workmanship of the clothing, It is described as etremelyspongyin its.toxture, badly put together, and quite unfit to stand the tear and wear of the rough work of the trenches. SonAe of the officers who had examined the clothing of the French soldiers stated that it was greatly superior in texture to that which was supplied to the British troops. " The experience gained in the Crimea appearsto establish the expediency of improving the quality and workmanship of every part of the soldier's clothing, but it would be vain to lookfor improvement so long as it is procured from the ran who offers it the cheapest, instead of from him who manufactures it of the best quality. ' The arrangements relating to the. issues of the supplies from the Quartermaster-Generals storesappear to have been of questionable expediency. The, officers commanding regi- mnents, brigades, or divisions were not made awarewhat arti-- cles were available for tho uso of the -men, and were informed that they need not sendin requiisltipns for what they wanted, because, whenever there were supplies 'for' distribution, approved requisitions would be sent to them for the propertions appropriated to their respective commands. The special wants of each corps were not, therefore, brought to the notice of the head of the department, as they would have been if requisitions had been sent in for what was required; and it appears that rugs, paillasses, blankets, greatcoats, and uniforms, remained undistributed, for which sequisitions would undoubtedly have been made if the commanding officers had known that they were in store. On these grounds Colonel Gordon icquits commanding offlcers of all responsibility in this respect. "We would venture to skggest that the commanding officers of brigades, or divisions, shouldbe informeed, at least once a month, of the contents of thei Quartermaster-Generalls stere, and that they should be held responsible for the transrnission to head-quarters of requisilions for whatever arti. cles they consider essential to the welfare of their men, whether these articles may be ir store or not. Commanding officers would then know how far the stores weMe capable of supplying the wants of their men, and tho Quartermaster-General would know what those wants were which his stores were unable to supply. " 14 the Appendix, we have given returns of the quantities on hand in the Quartermaster-Generars store at B3lai-lava on the 2d of December, and the daily receipts and issues from that date to the end of March. In the course of this investigation, however, it came to our knowledge that but little reliance could be placed upon the accuracy of the returns subsequent to the 25th of January. On comparing them with the quantities in store and issued, according to the Quartermaster-Generals books, it was found th.at the two accounts did not correspond, in some import. ant it1ems, by several thousands. -From the evidence of M?ajor Wetheral and of Colonel Gordon, it appears that, while by the retirns of Mr. Archer (the Commissariat officer in charge of :the Quartermaster-General's store at Ilalakiava), 36,231 great-coats had been received into that store, the Quartermaster-General's books show,as in store andissued, no morethan'23,880. A stillgrearte discrepancy is observable inh the blankets, of which Mr. Archer states nearly 75,000 to hate been receivedinto stbrebetween the 5th of December and the2SthofFebruary, wliereasthcQuatermaster-Generals - books shdw only 56,950. - These discrepancies, as well as others in regard-to different items, had giren rise tom3uch' correspondence between the Quartermaster-General's department' and-the Cohmmissariat, which did not result in any satisfactory'rectification of the'accounts.'The difference ppea~rs, in some sneasure, to have arisen from Mr. Archer's hem gin the habit~of writing off, as issues, ammerous supples which'had not been distrihuted tothe troops, hut whic'hhad merely beena transferred from the store atlislaklavt to the~ reserve store at Kadikoi, or to store ships in the harbour. -oi these entries Mr. Archer considered 'that he hadsufficient-authority, because he had poited out, in the end of January when it became necessary to occpy additional storehouses, that'ho could only be espo for sch as were in his own custody at 3lialdava.

She s-towaea .dawn the river from Gravesend out to sea, andl the pilot. left her off Deal at 6. oclochki onSu'nday evemng. -The, -weatlter was fine and clear, with a modeirate fair wind E.N:E., favourable for her run down Channel. --She had paised the South Foreland, and was proceeding as satisfac. torily as could be wished,vwhei,, Abouth alf-jast 7 o'clock, Sand ate bearing S.SW. nine miles distant, a cry was raised .by the lookout .forward of a " Isht ahead r" 7YhetliEr the steamner sao the Josephrie ihis o clated the distance she was off isw yet *to- be ascertai4ied. However sbe-came on, and struck- the..shin amidahipF with subh forco as to c&t berfdow;n to the water a edge. A' sceneof axnmst painful-;degeriptioii.inutediately. ensued among,tho passengers on board the Josephine Willis, and A rush -was made to get' in bdird the steamer: which was then ascertained tobe the Mangerton, Captain Bounhier, from Limerick. Unhappily, from some unexplained cause,Captain Bouchier almost directly backed his vessel out from the wreck. Only a few managed to scramblo on board the steamer, and others; as will bo'seen, were- acdidentallypicked up some time afterwards. Captain Canney, who throughout the whole of the tryIg secne exhibited the most tnoble andseanuanlike conduct, endeavoured to pacify the terrified creatures by assurin them that if they only attended to his orders they would al be saved. Heocalled to theni to cone aft, wherethe bulk of the passengers werelast seen; The ship then heeled over with the end of her yards in the water, and what became of her living freight is at present a matter of conjecture. It is known that she has gone down, as her topnmasts were to be seen just above water, not far from the spot where tho collision occurred. The Mangerton steamer appears not to have made any attempt to go in se6rch of the ship she had run inito. Her bowvs and stem were completely driven in by the force of the collision. However, no serious consequences were apprehenided from her condition. In addition to those Awho got on board her from the wreck she picked up a boat containing several persons, and at 6 o'clock yesterday morning she si'chored off Deal, whero several of the rescued paesengers were put ashore. As it was considered somewhat unsafe in her damaged condition to continue the voyage to London, it was proposed to send her inio Ramsgate to undergo some temporary repair. She ascordingly went into that harbour, and lnded the remnainder of those she had on board belonging tothe Jose. phine Willis; in all about 29. Among them were the first and second officers, the surgeon, and Er. and Mrs. Ray. It was then ascertained that at m'id night a boat had reached Folicestono fronm the wreck, with several of the crew, and from their statements Ioyd's agents.concluded that, as they reported they had left the wvreck on her beamends, with the passengers and crew shifting eargo and puniping, there was a chance of savng her, and a mimber of fishing-boats and luggers put to sea in the direction of tho w reck, in the hope of rendering her aid. Some of them returned without having seen anything of the ill-fated slhip. Several bodies, however, were observed floating about, and three vwere washed ashore, one, enidently a passenger (name unknown), with a life-preserver fastenedl round his body. The survivors stato that Captain 'Hunt, a passenger on boerd tho steamer, was instrumental in rendering assistanco to them and those who succeeded in reaching that vessel. As yet but an imperfect list has been obtained of thoso known to have been brought ashore. Me following are the only names sent up:-ZMr. Henry G. Ray and Mrs. ay of Milton, near Sittingbourne, Walter Wright, Georee forner, W. W. Wallis, MIr. Ford, S. Scott, C. leming, steward, passengers' cook, boatswain's mate, one midshiman, one apprentice, three boys, two sailors, and the ships butcher. The Josephine Willis was a new ship, and had only been one voyage. Her cargo is largely insured. According to another account all the women except two were lost. Three passengers, saved by the steamer, called at fessrs. H. H. willis and Co.'s offices yesterday; one had been in the waterhalf an hour. Seven passengers w-howere saved were taken into eal, and 17 into Riamsgate.

Observed the ship apparently starboard her helm and luff across our bows. Sceina the collision unavoidable, stopped the engines and orderea them to bh backed ; but before the engimeer had timie to reverse, the collision took place, the ship striking us on the port bow, the steamer striking her abaft the fore rigging on the starboard side. - Backed the steamer away from her. Burned blue lihht and rockets as signals of distress, and sent boats to assist tho sliip, whiceh proved to be the English ship Josephine Willis, Captain Canney, from London for -New Zealand, with passengers and a general cargo; found her in a sinking state, laid by her two hoors and a-half, and savcd such persons as we could. Tne last were taken off the topgallantyards, the ship's topsailyards being under water. l or 11 of the crew are supposed to have gone on shore at Folkestone in the ship's lifeboat.

Muirhead's rehouse, named James Mercer, but who had changed his name to Thomas Diamond, was a deserter.from the S2d Regiment of Foot. Sergeant Day, acdompanied by-a private of the 30th Foot, accordingly came and apprehended Mercer. When the soldiers entered the warehonse the young man was attending to a customer. The customer being supplied, Mercer was appreheud, taken from behind the counter, handcuffed, and, with tears in his eyes, marched along Argyle-street and Trongate, to the Ceintral Police-office, where Sergeant Day requested his lieutenant to lock up the prisoner til the mornig, on suspicion of being a deserter. Lieutenants Robb and -'Rae, be1ingon-duty at the time, asked the young man if he was a deserter ; he answered in the negative. These gentlemen accordmgly remarked to the sergeant that the young man depled bemg a deserter, anid, as his appearance entitled \Is 'statement to some credence, they must decline to Jock him up.

The corn-market was well supplied ihis morning, and a feeling almost of panic was observable, sdes being effected with difficulty at a further declne of 53. The closing quotations of the Freiich Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 72f. 20c. for money and 72£ 9oc. for the end of the month, showing in the former case a further imeprovement of a quarter per cent. At Amsterdam the market manifests steadiness, and Dutch stocks, -together with Russian, Spanish, and Portuguesc, have slightly improved. The letters fiom Paris mention that dtuing the settlement just concluded on the Bourase rates ranging from 30 to 35 per cent. per annum on some of the best railway shares were freely paid by the speculators for a rise, to avoid closing their accounts. Cautious persons, therefore, look on with soma anxiety, even although few apprehensions are now entertained of any delay in the conclusion of peace. -The value of the gold brought by the Shalinmar from Port Phillip is 320,0001. The James Baines was advertised to leave on the 25th of November, and would probably have alarger amount. Mlost of the present arrival is expected to be sent to France, but a small portion will perhaps be taLen to the Bank of England. The sulspension was announced this afternoon of Mesmrs. John Scott Russell and Co., the firm at whose works at Millwall the great ship for the Eastern Steam Navigation Company is in course of construction. Their liabilities are stated to amonnt to 180,0001., and the value of their asseta 'will depend much uponthe success of arrangements in progress to prevent the abandonment of some of their principal contracts. Measulres have already been' taken which will secure the building of the Eastern steamship from being impeded, and it is said that if similar means can be adoptedwith gard: to the completion of other vessels and works on hand a comparatively favourable result may be antifipated. The following circular has been issued by the house, calling a meeting of their creditors for to-nmorrov weekz, by hich time it is hoped the contemp$lated plans will have been matured:- !"3lllwa 5Works, Feb. 4. o Sir,-It is WithL deep regret that wo have to inform yore of our inability to fulfil our engagements as they severally becoime due, and have therefore tosolicit the favonr of your Attendance at a meeting, to be held' on Tuesday, the-12th inst., at noon punctnally, at the Gnildhall Coffeehouse, Ying-street, Cheapside, to consider of and deternine apon the itost effectualaud speedy mode ofEsettlement; and we trast' that the energies which will be exercised during the week wMill enable us toplace before yonua project for cffecting theforementionec psirposes which will, under all circumstan6es, be considerea satisactory. "We are, Sir, yours obedientlr j * ."J. SCoTT WiSSELL AND CO." The bar silver brought by the last West India stemer has been sold to-day at 61.d. per ounce, being an advance of Id. on the price realized for that by the preceding packet. The advices respecting the trade of the manufacturing towns during the past week are all satisfactory. At lanchester the demand for finished goods has been sufficiently steady to sustain quotations, while in yarns a very active business has taken plani, owin to the revival of confidence among the continental, and esecially the German manufacturers, consequent ulpon the expectation of ;ceace. From Biringham the accounts of the iron-market show no material alteration, although prices are in some degree weakened by underselling en the part of needy ir. who find it difficult to contend with the present rates of discount. With regard to the general occupations of the place, a tendency towards improvement continues -observable. The half-yearly meetings of the various banking companies have passed off-well, and in the case of the Dudley and Westbromwich Company a better result has been shown than was expected after their losses a year ago. At a meeting of the Chmunber of Commerce symptoms seemto have been exhibited of the salutary effect of the recent-writings of " MIercator," Mr. George Combe, and others, on the currency question, and in a motion on the sutbject M1r. Salt was supported by only two votes, the Chamber having resolved not to agitate it any further untilit shall be brought before Parliament. ThelNottinghiam report is highly favourable as regardsthedemandboth forlaceandhoisery. Inthe woollen districts thereisfair employment, stocks are moderate, and the home and export orders alike show signs of improvement. The Irish linen-market is without alteration, and reliance upon the prospects of the year is undiminished. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past wveek have comprised six vessels,-two to Port Phillip, one to New Zealand, one to Sydney, one to Swan River, and one to Portland Bay,-with affaggrega3te capacity of 4,461 tons.

Taylor and Honghton subsequentlytlet the premises to the preseut defendant, withe muiseion to use the place as n exhibition, and accordinply heappeared to have turned it into asort of "danny theatre." The entertainments commenced about 6o ocloclh, and were repeated twyo or more times each eren ing, the one performance occupyigt from an hour. to one hour and . a quarter, and consistvin of a variety of songs, in the chorus to which, it was stated, the audience were invited by the socalist to join, a hornpipe dancingtinpattens, poespiutibucst andlak peciesnof dramatic performance, spporrTe.by three or fourpersons in theatical i attire, but, ashvo of the witnesses siated, it wsi next to impobssbe to mak head or tail of the plot.

To such an extent had this nuisance arrived that respectable people were compelled either to turn into the robday orto crossorerto the other sidce. One effect of the exstence of this establishment s that the tradespeole close by were injured in their trade, and-a depreciation inthe 'value of the rents had followed to such anextent that the present action of ejecthent had bee commenced Mr. Seijeant ATKIso, for the defendant, contended that his client had not been guilty of any violation of the covenants of his agreement, iseeing that he had -only used thesreise asa place for an exhibition, for which purpose lfr.-Baron BrwA.ELL said that if they had done that Taylor and Hou hton had violated a covenant in their own lease, which of itself would give a right of r-eitry.

Tarn LATEPRDNCEPAS]UHW rM.-We a omonced the death of Prince Paskiewit.ch, in a late edition of our aper of Saturday. 'The following sketch of his career we * nd im theuiatrie.-"Prince- Ivan FedorowitehPaskie- mtschWas born-at Pultawa, of s noble and rich family, on the 12th of May, 1782; he consequently died in his 74th year. It was in 1805 that he first saw aetive service in the field, having beet sent by the Emperor Alexander to the assistance of theEmperor of Austna against the French. He had at that time attained the rank o captaim. In 1806 he was with the army in Turkey, and as long as the ex * dition lsted (from 1807 to 1812) distinguished himself by his military talents., He afterwards served in the campaigns of 181213-14against theFrench. War having broken out between Russia and Persia, in 1826, the Emperor Nicholas, in compliance w.ith the request of General Yermoloff, who comnanded in chief the army of the Caucasus, sent him General Paskiewitsch for his second in coimnand, in which position he greatly distingaished himself. In the yeir following General Paskiewitsch succeeded Ycrmoloff in the cdhief command.! He penetrated into the Persian territory, took several fortresses, defeated Prince Abbas Mirza, took possession of Erivan and Tauris, iand forced by his rapid ruccesses the Shah.of Persia to sue for peace, wlich was signed on the..9th of February, 1828. As a reward for his services the Emperor raised him to the rank of s count .of the Empire,- with the surname of Erivau, and gave him a million of roubles. To the 'war against Persia succeeded that against Turkey, in which the Prince _.captured Kars andEizeroum.- The Emperor, who in the course of the campaign had alreadysesit him the order of St. Andrew, and made him a presenit of tivo guns and a R-ag, named him field-marshal of his armies. The death of Marshal Diebitsch, who sanr in the month of May, 1831, beneath an attack -of cholera, made a vacancy in the chief command of the army sent 'anamt thePoles. The Emperor Nicholas conrided- it to MarsTaI Paskiewits-li, who, being =mmoned in-all haste, reached the seat of war in the month of June. The issue bof the campaign is well known--the eapture of Warsamw. by the Russians and the defeat of the Pols, notwithstanding their heroic resistance. Raised to the dignity of Prince of -Warsa'w, with the title of Highness, and the tfansmission of this title to posterity, Yarshal -Pasiewitsch was also created Viceroy of the kingdom of Poland, which post- he held tiU his death. He reappeared - t wice after this conquest in coimmand of an anny; the first time being in- 1849, during the Hungarian war, 'when Russia sent troops inaid - of Austria; and the second time being in -1853 at the siege of SiIJstria, where he received a contusion which compelled him to retire, not, it is said, w-ithout blaming the -operations. Prince Paskiewitsch was considered to.be favounrble to peace. At all events, it may be loolked upon as certanin tlhat he went much against his will to the Eiege of Silistaia.I ERAGGE ScHooLs in; Sou=wARE.-tast night the aanu-lsneeting of £he promoters of raged schools in the parish of St-deorge-the.Martyr, Soutxhwark; 'was held at the LteraryIshtttio,Borough-road, and 'was very nu*merousiy attended.

A very earnest * spirit in favour of these nev- educational institutions, of which there are not less than seven now established in the - ais,was evinced during the proceedings, and abunilait testony was borne to their utility. From the report, which wras read by the honorary secretary, Mr. Arthur liewsman, it appears that, in the seven schools no less than 1,05 childien are under actual training, there being 2,000 *salesenteredDonthebooks.- Althoughtnere-arel.40volun. i-ry teachers engaged in the -work of tuition, more are wanted. The benefit derived fro Visits on the- -. part of- persons interested in such. vumdertakings was also strongly insisted on.

The subct,.'in reference to which ho had poetponed glong to London, in order that her might addreTs a few observations to this meeting upon it, was' the present state of the affairs between this country andthe,United State., and hle was somewhat surprisedtofindnoallusiontoitinthoreport, of the association. He recollected Mr. Cobden telling a story, which he learnt when he was'in Paris not very long 'after the event happened, that'at the 'tine when affairs between France and England were very critical-he (Mr. Bright) believed it wasvwith regard to the Tahiti business,. or something equally absurd-a deputation came up from the Chamber of Conmmerce at Bordeaux to Louis Philippe. He vas not sure 'they did 'not' call the monarch out of bed, but at all even'ts they remained with him all night, argning the question which -was thus being handled by tho diplomatists of England and France and hurrying these countries into an apparently inevitable war, and they would not leave Louis -Philippe until he gave them his word as a king, thattthere should be no war between England and Franceuapon that question. Now, at this moment we knew just this, that we knew almost nothing. All that we knew was that nothing could: be known. Parliamenthad. met ; the correspondence between the English Foreign-office and the American Government was not laid before it; everything was subterranean, everythingwasc,ancealed. OurForeign Einister wasgoingtoParas to attend the negotiatians-he trasted,'and he hoped they all trusted, that he might be pro-eminently successfuL (Hear, hear.) TheirForeigni-office would then be left without its anthorizedhead, and in the handS no doubt, of the present -Prime Minister. Now, Mr. Bachanan, the American Minister, had stated in a despatch to his Government that if theGovernment of lord Aberdeen had remained two months longer in office all the points of difference between England and the United States wouldc' certainly have' been settled, and he (Mr. Bright) knew also that he had said so in conversation in' this country. Unfortunately a state of things had arisenout of the smallest trifle which rmight brmg us into difficulties as great in regard to America as those from whichwe hoped we ivere emerging with regard-to Russia. The furst steps which brought on a war were often so slight that a man would be laughed at if he supposed they would leadto any difficulty; but one step followed another on one side and on the other, until, by some blundering, things came to a point in which each party found his honour was concerned and he could not retrait ; and then tho question of national honour b'came the question at issue, while the original cause of dispute was forgotten and buried, never having been worth a thought, and thus great nations were bronght into struggles involving an enormous cost . of blood and treasure. If the negotiations were open and we knew what was doing, he perhaps need not have hadto eome there or' anywhere else, to talk about the matter, because he believed public opinion would snuff out a great many of these thingE; but, he would ask, what would be the result, if the merchants of Manchester confided the mlanagem~ent of their affairs, the buying of their cotton and goods, and the conduct of their export and import trade, to sonmc concealed conspiracy, almost, among their servants? WVhy, they would have no safety whatever in their various transactions. In thewords of the p resent head of our Foreign-office we had "drifted" into the war. in which we bad been engaged, which showed the incapacity and feebleness that had been at the heba, and who knew that we might notbe "drifting" into a war now? He heard a man the other day, who was a violent advocate for the war with Russia, denying absolutely the possibility of iwar with America, and-becomang almost as frantic in his denunciation of such a contest as he had been eager in justification of the other; but if we got into the position in which we wereafter the Russians crossed the Prth and, after the conferences in 1853, weamight now have a war with America, unless we did something that would be an lniiliatibn to this country; and he (Mr.Bright)w as muchagainst doing anything that should bring hnmiliatien on to this country as any man could be. -It would be much easier now to make peace than it would be when passions had been roused on both sides, and when men had said things they would wish they had not said. Take these two questions-the one under discussion, and the case of the Bulwer-Clayton treaty with regard to Central America. -Now he was not about to deny at aU that the words of that treaty might be shown or be made, by a person as imprtial ag we couild expect to be, to apharto bme mnore in favonlrof the.viewvtaken bvthe Eng thGovernmentthanbythe Amercan Government.That was the opinion to which he had inclined on examining it. But at the same time he thought it w as certain the American GovernmentrunderstDod it to mean the other thing, or else they would-never have agreed to it; 'and, therefore, he did not wonder that they took S different opinion from that of our own Government. But whatever the view was, it was not worth a straw to Fngland. We hiad jot' a smaU town o£ 400 or 500 houses, caled Belize, at the mouth of the river Belize; and two smal islands, which were perhaps of no value at aU; and, at any rate, this country was not going to engage in everlasting difficulties with the United §tates on their account. Lord Clarendon 'was willng to put it to arbitration, but it was one of those cases in which arbitration vwas difficult. If the arbitration were to decide whether the treaty was as the English Government said it was, or whether it was as the American Government said it wans, then the American Government would give notice and abandon the treaty, because they would never consent that the protectorate and tccu tien of England should continue while they understcod it should be abolished, and still adhere to a treaty which said they should-never occupy -and therefore the end would be, that the treaty would e at an end, and things would be just as if it had never been made; and the resut would be that the United States, being on the spot, as compared with this country, would be pushing some way or other -some of their ways he did not think were very wise or very just-in that direction, and there could be no doubt that, whether we went 'to war or not, our children would find that the whole of these countries were either in the actual possecsion or under the dominant influence of the. United !states of America, and nothing we could ever do could prevent it: (Hear.) 'He could not say that if we chose to impoverish onsselves, and go into the workhouse'in order to keep up an establishment there, we could not do it, but that would be all that we could 'achieve. He 'thought 'that T/c Time' gave admirable- advice to them the other day when it said it would be infinitelybetter that-this countryshould have no interest there whatever, and no sway over those savages in the Mosquito territory, tather than have any interruption for a single day of amncable relations with the UnitedStat But there wvas a question which pressed stil more, which the merchants and manufacturers of this district and of Yorkshire should have their attentSon tured to iomediately.' They recolleeted in December, 1854, there was a short session of Parliament assembled, chiefl to discuss the bil for the enlistment of foreigasrn. Hewasoneof those -who opposed -it. Mr. Gibson,his -colleague, also opposed it, and, to show how unnnecessaryft was, heawas not certain 'that any single prson enlisted under the bill had ever yet gotto the Seldof war or had tacen pt in any -milit-tr operation. Mr. Gibson's speech on that question, whichhe pIr. Bright) referredto last night in Hansard, was admitted by everybody to be the speech which it was impossible for the advocates of the bill to -meet in argument. lie said, if wewere going to have these foreigners, how was it to be done W 1 'ere we going to seduce men without th&iousent of their Governments'to enlist! Were we going~to -negotiate with idividuals2 Because rthat was contrary to the publc law of Europe. We might negotiate v;ithGovernments if we liked, but -if a foreign Governmet agreed with us to furnislh men'- for war they became parties to 'the ,war, and were no longer neutral, and therefore this biR was not necessary. - It was only necessary if we' were going to obtain men against the willof their Governments, and by some connivance of the Government. Well, what' had taken lace? onind iidtht -in'Fruiasa an English- consul had been amptissoned~; that we -had:been enticing from the Hanse Tov;ns, and' frdmHnmhurg, persons to come to Hfeligohand to enlist; and wvere it' not that those Go7ernments 'were too feeble, we should have got into difficulties with regird to them 'also. ' -But the thing 'of all others that was to him most in-credible was that the Government of an economical country-a country that had adopted free trade and contained an association called a Chamber of Commerce vithin its doninions-shouId go 3,000 miles to the westw ard, where the labotir of a common laboureron a farm was worth 4s. a-day, to enlist men and to tak-e them 3,000 miles to -the eastward to fight mnen whose labourwas not' wort'h more than' 6d. .a-dy. (Hear, hear.) '-What' they did was this. Mrr. -Crampto,, the h American Minister, Sir Bdiund , the Goveroer of Canada, and otlhers acting wder the directions of this Government, bad liben cor,cerned in~ obtaining; men in -the IntdSae Our G-evel-menm -sti i.;A oq'r United jS:-tates wholo of this proceeding w' an attemptso stUid that there - wa. ,no Ia:.cgeo fit te desribe; it-to *get alfew *knavii vagabonds in the -United States to come to Canida b, Nova scotia to bo e listedlin the BritisW army. Men 'vere enticed to Canada under pretence- of: gett1ng wo'Ck on the railways that were maidn there; but it Wvs known oery well what they were really goirlg for,' and t'ne thing was doio so foolishly that it got into the Wladelphia newspapers. This created great unpleasant. ness,' becaut?e -itmast be noted that there were a great zumiberof personsin theUnited Stateswhb, from oriecause or another t thized vrh Eu on the" Eastern huestion;and alo tathere weroa larportion of:the Irislpeopltherehohaimportant reasons, as they Ppo-edi raen Wh~~~~~~~~~~paet .for.leisighostilo to this countny. Well, the Englsh Governmnent stop^nd thei enlistment, but~ they did not mnake what' the iAmercau Goverent called suficient reparation or aPology, So far as ho understood it, ininaling an apology thoey deuied the comssion of the ofence which was very much hke finding a man gilty and saying, .Tho man is not guilty, but we; hope he owill never do so any more." (,aighter.) In 'this case, they seemed to express regret that they had violated the laws.of the United States, a t the lame time to argue that they had not violated the las' but perhaps we shouldsee more when the Goveruimnent laid on thi table of the house adl the correspondence with regard to the matter. But this point was undeniable,' that our Government were in error-in the course they had taken; the$ had fallen into the very thing Mr. Gibson warned them against, when he said, "You mrust et into trouble with these Governments if they are neutral." What should we havp said if the Russians had engaed privateers in the harboursof America? And what was the differenco between engaging men on board-ships and engaging men upon the land! It -was quite clear that our Government was wrong, but the Americans said we bed not made atonement sufalcent. Mr, Crampton had-obviously violated the laws of the United.States; they could not banishi'Mr. Crampton, because it was contrary to the rules of international pro. coedings; but his influence for good must necessarily be greatly impaired in that country, and therefore 'they asked us to recall him. It might he very unpleasant to' withdraw a' Minister; but there were things much mnore unpleasant than that. It was not so long since that we had a i3inister kicked out of Madrid in consequence of a very unnieasant despatch from our present Premier, which he had read there; and if our Government said, " We won't recall Mr. Crampton, beasuse it is. contrary to the dignity of this country," he (Mr. Bright) was of opinion that it was co'n. trary to the dignity o this country to violate the laws of the United States, and to take the course we had taken. No new;spaper in England that he had seen had denied tEat' our Government was wrong in this tnatter. (Elcar, hear.) But if we did not recall Mr. Crampton the American Go. vernmert would be inma very.differentposition. He observed an-insolent article in the Economist, spe3akng of President Fierce as being only at the head of a cque, ibt when we put him iato that position he would no longer he supported by a clique 'merely,, but by the whole public opinion oF the United States. We were in danger of getting into that posit:on from which neither nation could retract without what they called loss of honour-; and then we should see our 8,OOO,O001. 'of property afloat on the ocean, of which the chairman had spoken; become the victiu of privateers, and the whole Atlantic would be as completelyravaged as the Sea of Azoff had been bygour niwn cruisers. He regretted to see the serious tone that had been assumed, not only by-our own press, bot also by the more moderate of the leading journals of the United States, and, under all the circumstances, he should be very gLad indeed to have seen some action taken by this Chabi'er ' on the subject. (Applause). -The resolution wvas carried unnmously;* and a'wish having subsequently bcen expressed that Mr. Brzght should prerare a resolution, embodymng his sentiments eon the American question, the hon. member drewvupthe followingresolution, which was moved by Mr. WVatts, the Mayor of Man-' "TataChamber has observed wi'th deep regret that difficulties have ariseni betwveen the British Government and the Government of the Uinited States w ith regard to the constructio,n of a treaty on the subject of Central A merica, audto attempts which are alleged to have been made to enlast men for the British army within the jurisdiction of the Utnited States; this-Chamber would urgently imapress n~pon the Government of this country the propriety of considering these questions in 'a conciliatory spirit, with a strong determination to spar alike to the tumted Kingdom and the United States the indescribable evils which must arisefrom any interruption of amicablerelations between the two counmtries." The resolution was unanimously agreed to. a r
THE ColuRECroN oF CIxE cAL DRmNQ-uEy._ "1 wish to say a word on another topic, which may appear, at first sight, mainly to concern those of us in holy ordes, butwhich virtually affects our lay brethren no less than ourselves. I mean cIergy discipline, or measures for the correction of elerical debnquency. Now, that the personal character of its religious instructors is of vital importance to the nation vwill be at once admitted. Nothing can be' imagined more so. The evil results to religion, the injury to a parish, from the misconduct of a clergyman, cannot be overrated; and the difficulties interposed by law, and the consequent expense of prosecuting such cases to conviction, are much to be deplored. None are more interested in facilitating the ends of justice in this respect than we, the clergy. We can have no desire to extenuate or screen delinquency in our own order. Our wish must be ' that inquiry should be made of evil ministers, and that they be accused by those who have hivowledge of their offences, and, being found guilty, byjust judgment be deposed.' And this for the sake of religion i wad of the altars at which we serve. 'Not that the efficacy of Christ's ordinances lies in the hands that minister them, forasmuch as we minister not in our own name, but in Christ's, and by His commission and authority. Not that the grace of God s gifts is diminished from such as by faith and rightly do zeceive the sacraments n.inistered unto them, shichtbe effectual because of Christ's institution and prhc misc, although they he ministered by evil men.' But we know that when the hands that minister are polluted men abhoz the offering of the LorLd Andindayswhengever pubject is so freely canvassed; andhthe acts ad ppretensionsof all pubchefunctioarie5 aretso eenlystfted, the characterand Hadu e teoseofythe bergy are ofbcoseexposedtothe severest scrutiny. WVeare all aware that dissaffection to the church, that even secession from its ranks, is justified by the laxity aud imefflciencyofmembers of ourhbody. And in dealing with pubEic questions, such as church-rates, or populareducation, or cathedral property, we must needs bear this in mind. Hiad we, the clergy, been more blameless in our lives, more apostolic in our labours and demeanour, more free from the t-iint of filthy lucte; had our walk and teaching been better exponents of the Christian church,we should have had fewer adversaries to contend with, more friends to rally rounad the cause we advocate. Iu a measure we are suffering, and the church with us, for the faults of our own order. And it would teach uscaution, even in thingsapparently indifferent, 'if we bore in' mind that while by earnestness and charity, and a holy fear of offending, we may uphold the cause of God's church and truth in the worst of times; so does it estimation and affection of the people by any apparent deficiency on our part in piety, or modesty, or discretion. - If-we would have the hearts of our flocks, we m ust be tolerant, even of their prejudices; if we would ude them, We must rule ourselves; if we would have them deferential, we must be ourselves subordinate. Above all, the laity must' feel that the standard. we propose to them we are williung to have applied to ourselves. Great scandal bas been caused not only by flagrant instances- of clerical misconduct, but by the difficulty of dealing with these; cases of notorious immorality have been left unpunished, criminous clergy allowed to retain their cures for years, to the almost irreparable detriment of the church and relgion, in consequence of the inadequate provision of the law, and the difficulty and cost of prosecuting the offender to conviction. Under such cir-- cumstauces, it is idle to blame church authorities. The doctrine of the church, as recited in her 26th Article, is indeed p'.ain and peremptory, but in practice it is a dead letter. How can we expect parishioners to impeach, or churchwardens to present, or blshops. to calioflenders to account, when the result may only be a ruinous expense to themselves, and the evasios- of the culprit through the want of precision in the law? With a view to amend this state' of things, more than one measure his been lately introduced to Patliament, but without receivingthe legislative sanction. And in the last session of Convocation a joint committee of the two Houses was nominatedto consider a billon which it was understood that the sense of the general body would Ibe taken. That -committe, of which I was myself a member, was never called together; and when the measure, without having been subject to the preliminary examination, as proposed, was suddenly sent down to the lower House for its approval, that body, though it entered on its provisions as far as time allowed, properly dechlied to give, impromptu, its sanction to a - measure of such grave importance, and demanding such mature deliberation.' A biU on this subject was to have been introduced by Government into the Hoise of Commons during the present session; but has been withrawn. - I had only a cursory view of its provisions, but I observedthat one clause-empo weri g the bishop, with the consent of the accused, to deal summaxily and in private with certain cases-and whichhad hadbeen rejected by the Lower Hlouse of Con-- vocation, wasi st rietain'ed." It wilf, I am sure, be felt that of all questions, affecting so deeply, as it does, the vital interests of the chutch, this is the very last -admitting of crude and hasty legislation. It is one on which the senseof the church at large should be taken. Unlhappily, we have at present no means of consulting in synod the lay members of our communion; but I hope, should this mea-- sure be revived, to take the opinion of the clergy of this archdeaconry on what so nearly concerns their order. - For myself I will only say that the committing cases of clerical delinqucncv to a commission exclusively or mainly composed of der en, seems to me objectionable. Itis, I believe, generally held that the clergy as a body are not good judges of evidence; at least, we have the recorded opinionof a distiguished legal authority to this effect. And' though I believe that in our anxiety to avoid an appearance of partiality we should be aptto go into just the opposit6 extreme,itwrouldbeniearlyiipossibleforustoescapeasuspicion of favouring the accused. Yet such impression would defeat theendinview, and only enhance the scandal vhich all tnie frientds of religion wish to be removed. The object df .justice, of course, IS not merely the detection of the guilty, but the exoneration of the innocent. There shonld be i.o dattger of a.verdiet being impeached. The victim of a fal e accusation should step fort, not only with his charactir 'unimpaired, but with a claim to the sypathy of'all:go.d men. And, this result, in the case of a clerical defendant, 'couZld only be s'cured by insanelling a jury as far as pos-sible free from supicion of eltherprejudice orprepossessior, nd whose-verdict would- command. universal assent.

- M_LLITARY EDUCATION.' OK - ' TO)iE EDITOR OF THE TnMs.;' Sir,-It is an object 'of the first importanco' in every adninistrative reform to effeot it without the addition of new machinery to the engine of State. Accordinigly, if the task of improving the education of British officers and soldiers *cn be distributed -between the schools of the country on the j;ue haud, and the regiuental syster on tho other, such an arrangement *ould be greatly prefernble'to_the iiutroduction of extrardinary means. I would venture, therefore, to submit for consideration whiethner the following measures would not answer the purpose:- - - The education of an officer, as of every othoerprofessional man, consists of. two parts-viz., the knowledge -speiail to his calling, and such gereril knowledge as is necessary,to enable him to acquire, digest, and apply intelligen'tly, the special knowledge.' The acquisition of the general: knowledge imst precede that of the *dpesalin order of time, and should be made a sie qt& sioni fof admission into the'proession. Such i rule beingenforced withoute~xception or relaxation, the creation of this imdispensable knowledge mayb'ce left to the operi-' tion of -suply and demand. In order, however, to maintain the rule thus ushaken the definition of the knoeiiedge in questio. miLst be confined tothe- most rigo'rous and de-monstrable utility iLs regards the future profession. Doubt- less the more cultivated aman is the better; cvlris pvaybus.' he willdo in every calling of life; but it isno less true that a man cannot know everything, and that ;li knowledge is not equally useful at altimes. PJatitude as this may seem,. alarge proportion of the improvementsvhich are urgently needed in the management of our institutions,, civil, ecclesiastical, and military; are discredited from overlooking it. Suppose it were laid down that no man slall receive a commission who cannot pass a satisfactory exam-ination in- L English composition. 2. English history. 3. Geography, political and physical. 4. Arithmetic (including vulgar and decimal fractions). 5. Latin, French, German-ono only. 6. Euclid (three books), algebra (to the end of simple equations)-either. It cannot be pretended that this programnie exceeds the powers of any lad of common industry and intelligence in his 17th year; or that the existing schools (commercial, grammar, and public) do not profess to supply it; or, lastly, that it is not indispensable as the foundation of miitary studies; and such knowledge ought to be acquired before a lad receives his commission, not only because the machinery already exists for giving it to him at that time, but, stiU more, because it is schoolboy's work, and therefore every attempt to impart it afterwards is regarded by the tyro as a revival of the pedagoue, with his beggarly elements, and is contemned accordingly, whereas professional knowledge of all kinds has a serious and manly air about it. Now, suppose that to every regiment, with its officers thus recruited, there were attached a military instructor, himself a commissioned officer, and messing with the officers, his pay and regimental precedence equal to that of a major. Such an instructor'might form just as much a member of every regiment as its surgeon or riding-master. The Commander-in-Chief might make the appointments froim among thoso officers who had obtained-a due certificate after examination at Sandhurst. AU officers of a regiment below the'rank of captain might be obliged, as part of their military duties, to attend the lectures of the regimental instructor for three hours on alternate days; to prepare in the meantime such exercises as he might set them; ..to produce a certificate from himbefore they could receive their troops or companies; and anso, at that stsge, to pass a final examinatior4 with distinctions for proficiency, before a district or central board. No one can have seen anythirig of garrison or barrack life without knowing how many hours might be spared for such a purpose from those which are now the domain of pure ennui, without seriously encroaching on those which are animated by the smallest fun or spirit. It would be beside the purpose of this letter to say wl:at the military instructor should teach. Ho and his pupils should be the senior class of Sandhurst in miniature, ind the lecture-rooms should be out of doors at least as often as within. By the time a subaltern- had shifted his quarters with his regiment, as oftemi as such removals occur, in the average time of service, before getting a captaincy, he would generally have seen every kind of country-open, enclosed, plain, mountain, coast, inland, cultivated, barren, populous, empty-in which an army could have to act, and might thus receive all the essential lessons of tactic and supply, with a modelon the scale of life under his eyes. A non-commissioned instructor of the rank of a coloursergeant might perform analogous duties for such of the mnen as -ould already read and write, and until they can do so I really see no more reason for exempting them from the attentions of the school-sergeants than from those of the drill-sergeants. The non-commissioned instructor would be chiefly employed in the details and ratiomuase of military economics--how to forage, how to pack, how to cook, how to provide against the weather, what precautions to observe in different climates-all those particulars, in fact, for want of knowing and attending to which thousands of brave men perish in every campaign. The point to which I desire to bring these remarks is, that an offlcer's andsoldier's professional knowledge wil not tak6 root unless, it be inade an integral part of the military system, so as to fall under all the influences of personal honour, discipline, and esprit 2ut corps, while to effect this a very simple addition to the establishment of eaeh regiment, with an affiliation to Sandhurst, would suffice.

THE PRISONS OP EaImANn.-The 20th report of the Inspectors of Prisons in England, published on Saturday last, includes the gaols of the southern and western district, aid refers almost exclusively to matters of local details, some of which may be noticed intlheir place. The report states that the act for the better care and reformatidn. of juvenile offenders has alreadyled to the foundation of several reformatorysch'ools in the'district, six of which are in active operation. Any detailed account of their operaEion is deferred till the next report.: At Brecon one of the Prisoners was so depressed in spirits from long confinement that he was excused from hard labour at the request of the inspector. The conduct of the authorities of this (Brecon) county gaol is severely reprobated, on the ground that no .ste ps whatever have been taken to remedy the demorfl'* evils occurring in this prison from the very inadequate cell accommnodation, and this, too, in defiance of fepeated zemonstrances from the Home-office. Aberyatwiith gaol has been very improperly used by the borough authorities as a lunatic asylum. At arnarvon, the numerous evils formerly cornlainiedof remain in full force, andthe ate .of the celis would seem to be mostdig In the Cardiff county gaol the - accommodationismost inadequate,, and the prisoners 'areall associated together, without any work in the most demoralizing maniner, in utter disregard of the law., The prisoners regretted their compulsory idleness, but nothingwas given themntd do. The" religious instruction!' afforded by the chaplain is quite insufficient. .The governor is excused; however, owing to. his igisorance of the acts of ParzEisaent in force, to supply which no provision is' made. The debtoirs prison at Swansea is a wretched specimen of irregularity; .among other instances, one of the debtors was allowed to accommodate a friend from the town with half his bed whenever he, was nut absent from Swansea. At Montgomery prison (the largest in Wales) the want of a schoolmaster is urgently felt. At Haverfordwest gaol the greater humanity of the French law of 4mprisonment for debt is forcibly called to mind, when it is found that an old man of 70..yearsof age is incarcerated in anoisomeprison fora debt of I4. andinterest. The gaol of New'wadnor is a disgrace to the nation, and, 'althou it ought only to be .used>'as a. house of temporary deesntion, prisoners have been -kept there a whole fortnight. The * aig -alrd" was founad to 'be occupied: 'o two donkeys ana ay large hog, it being, too,. eviidently their .ordinary abode.

At the Exeter city. gaol the system is abominably, defective, and rather adapted : "to .foster:thantorepress the growth of crime."
