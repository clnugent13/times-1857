MONBY-MABBT an 1IT YIKTBLLIGBNR.g The En h fds opened Mondi y Evening. The nglsh und opnedsteadily this morniing, and, although there was subsequently a slightreaction, the market ag recovered before the close of business. The first transactionsin Consols for money were at 92 to 93. A reaction then occurred to 92i, but some purchases of Reduced and Exchequer-bills by the Govermnent brokers caused a rally, and the final prices were 92i to 93 for money and 93k for the 7th of May. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213; Reduced, 91 to New Three per Cents., 91i to 92; India Stoo, 221 to 223 - Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; India-bonds, 10s. t bse. discount; aud Exchequer-bills (H'arch) 5s. to Is. discount. In the Stock-Exchange as well as in the discount. market and at the Bank of England the deraand for monev was only moderate. Foreign securities were quiet, the transactions generally having been unimportant. Turkish and Spanish exhibited heaviness towards the close. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 94 and 94# for money, and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 100i and 100. The general operations comprised-Brazilian Eive per Cents., 99k; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., INew, 99; Chilian Six per Cents., 102i; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96 and 96k; Sardinian Five per Cents., for account, 91; Spanish Three per Cents., for money, 41i; the New Deferred, 25 Spanish Certificates of Coupon not funded, Og; lDutch.Two-and-a-HEIalf per Cents., 65i; and the F our per Cents. Certificates, 96k. The corn-market was firm this morning, and for superior descript-ions an advance of between is. and 2s. was obtained. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 25c. for money and 69f. 40c. for the end of the month, showing another decline of more than a quarter per cent. Money at Paris is said to be in increased demand. At Hamburg the rate is still 6i per cent. The introduction of the Russian Railway scheme has been attended by some revelations which perhaps will not surprise the public, except in so far as they show a want of that adroit management expected from the well-practised continental financiers and speculators who have committed themselves to its success. That every effort would be made to drive the shares to a premium before the date of allotment was scarcely to be doubted, but, looking at the extraordinary facilities afforded by a combination which includes most of the principal operators on the European Bourses, it was considered improbable that the opinion on this point would ever be allowed to assume any form beyond that of a general inferencoe. It appears, however, that facts have already transpired which among prudent minds will impart to the matter much of the force of certainty. Of course, it is always possible for the concoctors of companies, by seeking to buy shares in anticipation of the allotment, to send them to a premium sufficient to render them attractive to the public, and to induce a flood of applications, and the process becomes more easy in proportion to the number of European markets open for dealings in them, as the electric telegraph instantly communicates to all the effect produced upon any one. Under these circumstances most of the respectable dealers in the London Stock Exchange have resolved to exercise great caiLtion with respect to the present scheme, and to refuse to enter into transactions previously to the regular issue of the shares. How far this resolution is necessary may be judged by the following facts :-A respectable stock broker's firm having received an order from a Protestant clergyman at Brussels to invest 200001. in Russian Railwa shares deemed it expedient to make inquiry, an found that their client the clergyman was not the principal in the transaction, but had sent the order in his own name to oblige a very rich and influential frMend in that capitaL A further developement remains. Having, mentioned the circumstance to a friend, they ascertained that another order for the purchase of 20,0001. had been transmitted by a clergyman through a mercantile house. Their first impression was that it must have been the same individual in each case. On inquiry, however, they gathered that in this instance it was ani English clergyman, although the resemblance was still perfect, since this gentleman also has since admitted that he was acting merely as an agent. Thus the matter stands. The inquiries for the shares consequent, apparently, on these devices has had the effect of tempting some few of the dealers to make a price for them to-day of to I premium. It will be for the public to judge the value of such quotations. The whole story seems almost incredible, but in case any denial of it should be hazarded, those from whom it proceeds will, it is said, be found ready to substantiate it in every particular. The letters from Paris to-day state that the proposition for doubling the capital of the Bank of France was discussed and adopted on Saturday, subject to the approval of the Council of State and the Legislative Chambers. The entire amount (4,000,0001.) is to be advanced to the Government on a deposit of Rentes, and, in addition, the Bank are to lend to them 2,400,0001. during the whole duration of the charter, which is now to be prolonged 30 years. Each holder of a share in the Bank will have a right to a new one at the price of 1,100f., to be paid by various instalments. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised five vessels,-three to Port Phillip, one to Sydney, and one to Adelaide,-with an aggregate capacity of 2,145 tons. The rates of freight exhibit little variation. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been little change. The number of ships reported inward was 194, being 18 less than in the previous week. These included 65 with cargoes of corn, flour, rice, &c., 17 with cargoes of sugar, and 1 cargo of tea. The total number of vessels cleared outward was 112, including 14 in ballast, showing a decrease of 8. The following, relating to the abstraction of specie by the Peruvian revolutionary party from one of the vessels of the Pacific Steam Company, was posted to-day at Lloyd's .- "It appears that the late attack by the revolutionary party In Pern upon the steamer New Grenada, belonging to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, resulted in the abstraction of only that portion of bullion which had been sbipped by and was the property of the Peruvian Govemr ment. The bullion destined for England was untouohed by General 'Vivanco's adherents." At a meeting of the Scottish Australian Investment Company, held to-day, Mr. W. H. Dickson presiding, it was atoreed to sanction the sale con- .itionally made to the Bon Accord Copper Company of their interest in the Bon Accord property inSouthAustralia. A long discussion took place with regard to the value of this mineral section, ancd the terms arranged, and it was nearly the unanimous opinion that the contemplated sale would prove advantageous to all the parties interested. One or two of the shareholders thought it would have been advisable for the Scottish Australian Company to have arranged for a less share interest in the new undertaking, but, after explanations from the directors, who stated that an impression is entertained of the 10s. paid being sufficient to develope the property, these adverse views were not enforced. In answer to an inquiy it was mentioned that the sale nas been arranged for the Eon Aecord Comupany to take the land, &c., with minerais, as it at present exists, and that it shall be found that the Burra Company have worked into the lodes, it will remain with the directors of the Eon Accord to seek their remedy. Favourable descriptions were given of the estate, in which the North British Australian Company are also partially interested, whose shareholders meet to-morrow to give the question consideration, and a letter was read, received since the formation of the Bon Accord Company, showing the belief entertained as to the value of the ,minerals. Annexed Is the resolution passed:- " Resolved,-That the sale conditionally made by the directors of the Scottish Australian Investment Company (Limited) to the Bon Accord Copper dmning Company (.imited) of their interest in the Bon Accord Property in 'south Australia for tho sum of 12,000. in oash anA 8,000 shas in the BonAccord Copper Mining Comjpany ited) of 31. stereng each, with 10s. per share paicd thereon, together with the proportionate share of the Scottish Australian Investment Company (Limited) in a royalty of onetwentieth of all ore to be raised from the uroperty be and hereby is sanctioned and confirmed; and that the directors of this company for the time being he and hereby are authotired and empowered to hold the said shares for and on account of the company, or otherwise to deal with the same in any way that they in their discretion may judge to be most for the benefit of this company."

P4LA-WA Y AND MINITNG SBARpS. Mlonday Evening. The railway-market was not altogether well supported, and cases occurred in which the decline ranged from Is. to lOs. per share. French were unfavourably influenced by erles, and the best deEcriptions showed a fall of about lOs. Indian and foreign were steady. After the usual hours of busines3 there was rather a firmer tone, a few purchases having then taken place. The new Russian shares were nominally quoted A to 1 pm., but no bond fde transactions are believed to have been concluded. Riga left off i to I pm.; and Punjaub, # to i pm. In the shares of the banking, mining, and miscelaneous companies the operations generally were limited.

The Record tells the following extraordinary story:-" A short time since a decently-dressed pedlar, in the course of his rambleg, caled at a house at the west-end of London, *nd, by dint of perseveannoe, succeeded in gaining the drang-room, wfhere the young ladies of ihe house were sitting. He presented his wares-laces and fashionable haberdashery of various kinds. Having duly extolled is saleables, and having disposed of some of them, he directed the course of conversation very adroity into quite another okannel and uitimately proposed to be permitted to introduce the young ladies to ' Father Faber,' of the Brompton Oratory. Some surprise was expressed on hear. ing this-proposition, and on being uked what he had to do Vth the' torian Fathers,' he admitted that be was him. self a French prlest, whoso occupation it Wu thns to Inginuate himself into societ, or, as the Aposte would say, to ' creep into housest and lead captive silly wromen.'

TEE IycOMi.Tx. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEB T1mES. Sir,-As it does not appear to be generally understood at whit rate inoome-tax should be deducted from various descriptions of annual interest falling due on and after the 6th inst., I eacloee you a copy of a letter Ireceivedin reply to 'questions addressed by me to the Board of Inland Revenue upon the subject, in consequenee of finding that only 7d. in the pound was to be deducted from the dividend upon Turldsh Bonds due and payable on the 10th inst. If you deem the matter of sufficient importance, you will probably give publicity to tho same in your columns. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. TH(OMrAR A PTTCTr 49, haringcross, April 20. "Inland Revenue, Somerset-house, April 8. "Sir,-In reply to your lotter of the Ist, I am directed by theBoard of nlwad Revenue to state that the dividends of the Turldsh Loan fall within the rules of charge in schedule a of the Income-tax Act, and that according to such rules the whole of the dividends which will become due on the 10th inst. wil be liable to assesment for the year commencing the 6th of A 1857, at the rate madAe payable for that year by the W Victo chap. 6-vin., 7d. in the pound, in the same manner as the whole of the halfeaT's dividends which wll be due onthe 6th of July next in respect of the Three per Cent. Consols. It is a mistake, however, to suppose that alU annal interest which wil become due subsequently to the 5th inst. wil be chargeable with the tax at 7d. in the pound only. In cases where such interest is payable out of profits and gns charged in part by assessment for the year 1856 at the 'te of Is Ad. in the pound, it follows that, in order that the person paying the xnterest may be reimbursed, he mus make a deduction at the rate of Is. 4d. in the pound on that portion of the interest which accrued up to the 5th of the present mnonth, and at the rate of 7d. in the pound on the remainder. " Accordingly, the interest which wiU become due after this date on railway debentures wil be subject to a deduction in conformity with that principle. " With regard to the interest of the Exchequer-bonds and Exchequer-bills payable in May and June, the interest of the bonds comes under the rules of charge in schedele C, and wUl be liable by assessments to be made for the year 1857 to the tax at 7d. In the pound on the whole of the interest to May. A different rule, however, applies to the interest of the Exchequer-bills, which is chargeable pursuant to a special provision in the act of Victoria 17, chap. 24, at Is. 4d. in the pound on the portion to the 5th inst., and at 7d. in the pound on the remainder. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, " T. SARGENT. "Mr. Thomas A. Rush, 49. CharinE-cross."
THE TEA TRADz.-April 20.-The deliveries in London estimated for the week were 1,156,4091b., which, compared with those of the previous week, when the operation of the new duty caused an important increase, exhibit a falling off of 3,441,0921b. P ACAICAOICBSTMT .-The seventh aimual report of the Aberdeen Rngged Kirk Mission says -" The mission has now reached the eighth year of its history it may be profitable, therefore, to give a comprehensive view of its rise and progress. The first meeting of the mission was held in the lowest rooma of a wretched house, rented for 6dL a-week. That house is now tenanted by quiet people, while the congregation gathered by the labours of the mission assemble near in one of the most comnfortble and aon. venient chapets in Aberdeen. At the time the first misdon was opened we had to contend with the evil Influences of a penny theatre and a publichouse for every ten families in the district; now there is but one spirit shop in AIbionstreet; eight publichouses in the neighbourhood have been closed for want of custom, and their places supplied by butchers' and bakers' shops, temperance coffee-rooms, and eating-houses, while the ;penny theatre has long since disappeared. When the mission commenoed Albion-street was a chief seat of crime in the east end of the city; now it is quiet and orderly, while the social tate of the locality generally is more or less improved. In 1848 there were above 400 children in the district at no schooL For 250 of those we have provided school accommodation; they reeeive the elements of education at a fee of ld. a-week and while these schools proser the other schools in tie east end of the city continue to be better attended. At an early period in our history the services of the Lord's-e-y used to be to some extent disturbed by many idle boys congregating about tho chapeL Sunday schools were opened for these, and now, while 200 children attend them, part of the scholars occupy a portion of the gallery of the new chapel on the Sunday morning. At the commencement of the mission we were glad to see 30 persons present at the ordinary Lord's-day service; now we gencrally have from 100 to 10 in the morning and afternoon, and from 400 to 500 in the evening. It was feared by some that as our mission progressed the dtminguishing featur by which it was own as a, recaisming itnstitution might dosappear, but this haa not been the case. It may be mentioned as a roof of the eoonomicd bhabits of the pople that during the last sevn s they have saved, by sieans of their Penny and 1,80L?. At To teiotset of the mi aion no lectures on science, temperance, or mhoral philosophy were given in the distrion, now we have such lectures every week, and since the mission was opened 400 have been delivered by the ablest lecturers which the city afford, all of which have been well attended. We have lso a library and the people have bought 35 bibles andl 40,000 tracts and magazines, in subscriptions of a penny and balf&penzny a week. To maintain the charater of a district misson church we selected another destitute spot as a6 new ground of operation, and erected thereon a small mnission chapel or ragged kirk. The attedane prmiss wel, nd te msio alogehr shows howr the sunken massses in our Larze towns may be effectually raed," From the list of donations appended we observe that the Queen still continues to encourage the mission, having subscribed to its funds about 100?.

IBELAND. CHUVRCH EDOATION SOOCUTY. fwRn-.s atnx OWN 0OPMXPONDWNT.) DUBLIN, FRIDAY MOR2N'G. Coming at the tail of the general election, the aniual meeting of the Church Education Society held yesterday at the Rotunda naturally created comewhat more general interest than attaches to those periodical reunions of the opponents Of the national system. The Earl of Clancarty was the chairman, the duties of which office in the earlier stages of the society's existence wvere discharged by the Lord Primate; but for 12 or 13 years past his Grace has not been present at any of the anniversaries, delicate health and extreme old age precluding him from any longer taking an active part in public life. The attendance was numerous and respectable, including the Lord Chief Justice Lefroy, the Earl of Belmore, Lord Castlemaine, several members of Parlianmeut, and a large body of the clergy. The report was, as usual, a very lengthy document, but its main features may be easily set forth. Co omencing with a solemn declaration to abide by the principle of scr.ptural education, and to refuse acquiescence in any arrangement that would exclude the Bible from the children intrusted to the care of the Protestant clergy, the report proceeds as follows:- "zTbankful should we be indeed to be enabled to avail ourselves of the funds annually voted by Parliament for the education oi the poor in this countrY, if we could do so, bolding our conscience clear and keeping our principles uncompromised. A newI Parliament may recognize our righteouis scruples sd demands, cnd we are not without hope that ere long Hier Majesty's Governnment itself vill (accordinog to the ten,ur of the motion carried in Parliament last year by the light Hon. Spencer YWalpole) mlske such modifioat:.n in the rles of the national system as will enable us to participate in the national grant. The votes of the late Houne of Commons gave, session after session. indications in,creasingly in our favour, until at last we had a majority on the occasion of Mr. Walpole's motion. An unmworthy contrivance nullified that majority for the time, but we are persuad. d that not only were the debate and the issues of it just referred to advantageous to our cause but that the inquiry previously instituted in the House of Lords into the working of the national system of education in Ireland will vet be attended with other good results, though their Lordsshps carne to no resolution except to report the evidence." It appears that the number of sebools in connexion with the society for the year ending the Slst of December, 1856, has been 1,769, and of scholars enrolled in them 85,569, thus represented in detail:- Members of the Established Church ... 55,966 Protestant Dissenters ... ... ... ... 13,833 oioman Catholics ... ... ... ... 15,770 85,569 This reduction in the number of schools and scholars as compared with those of last year is accounted for by the fact that, in consequence of the strict nature of the trust committed to the governors of Erasmus Smith's schools, it was deemed expedient to riequest the society to omit the names of those schools from the annual report. Nevertheless, there is no cause for despondency; on the contrary- "- It is observable that, despite of the unparalleled exertions of the Papal Legate here, and the whole body of the Romish hierarcby and priesthood banded together against us-despite the larFe amount of public money for educa. tional purposes which they have at their disposal, nearly 16,000 Roman Catholic children are attendirg our schools, drawing 'water from the wells of salvation,' and reading thoFe Holy Scriptures that are ' able to make wise unto salvation through faith which is in Obrist Jesus.' Here, therefore, is the 'United System of Education' so much prized and longed for by our rulers, but which is only to be ound in those Scriptural schools which have hitherto been discarded and neglected by the State." The society's income for the past year amounted to the sum of 39,52fil. 11s, from all sources, being a sum less by 5,3881. 14s. 2d. than the receipts of the former year. This diminished income would be discouraging if it could not be accounted for principally by the fact before stated-namely, the withdrawal of the returns of the very numerous schools under Erasmus Smith's board from the lists. In conclusion the report says-- " We have thus, in as few words as possible, rendered an account of our pnbition and prospects. ' Faint, yet pursuing,' we continue to protest against any restriction sought to bo imposed on the free, unfettered use of God's Holy Word. We d&ro not, for any earthly consideration, with. hold the bread of life from perishing souls. We must feed the lambs of the Saviour, the little ones of His flock. As Protestant miniisters and people we have here taken our stand, and will, wvith God's grace, continue so, waiting for Einm, in His own good time, to ease us of our embarrass. ments by a sounid settlement of the education controversy. In this attitude we s-ea Christian sympathy and co-operation. Long and painful to many of us has been the struggle in tire assertion of principle and the maintenance of truth, and we render praises to the ' God of all grace,' who has hitherto sustained u1s. Lot us not, then, be weary iu well doing ; let us be cheered in our onward course by the prayers, the exertions, land the liberal contributions of our people, and let us all do in God's strength what devolves upon us in the way of duty. - at,s ,s,t one jot of heart or hope, " ,'.sti.l bear no and steer 'Riht invard.nt -Such minst bo ouir determination while the trial lasts. WVe feel convinced that we have a good cause; and, notvwith. standiw'g the ranay refuzsals wve have met with from those in power, as year after year we have sought relief from onr burdesw , our persuasion remains unsbaken that the sense of justice whibch imblues so strongly tlle British mind wiill at last awake in our behalf, and compel the Legislature and the Covernmuent to recognize our clainis." It was expected that the Bishops of Ossory and Casbel would take part in the proceedings, but neither of the right rev. prelates was present, and the speeching was nearly all in the old hands,-to wit :-Mr. G. A. Hamilton, M.P., Mr. Grogan, M.P., Mr. Wl'hiteside, M.P., Mr. A. Lefroy, oexM.P., the Rev. Alexander Pollock, and Mr. Joseph Napier. It is almost needless to say that there was nothing new or noticeable in the several lengthened addresses of those gentlemen. DUBLIN, Mo2nvY MoRNIr-nG. TILE IRlST (31IEF sEcRCE.TA1YsrIll. Spreculating upon the probability of Mr. Bernal Osborne being the successor to Mr. Horsman in the office of Irish Secretary, the Nrth1ern Whig observes,- " If Mr. Bernal Osborne is to be Secretary for Ireland the change will be an unmixed blessing. Mr. Osborne is not an Irishinan-and, perhaps, Secretaries for Ireland ought to be foreigners-but he mnarried into an Ilush family, and in character be is peculiarly fitted for political success in this country. MIr. Osborne is bold and frank, and in aU respects the reverse of Mr. Horsman, whose diplomatic cautious. teas was something more than offenuive, inasmuch as it is said to have deterred a great number of gentlemen from 'business.' Mr. Osborne, not only as proprietor of large estates in Tipperary, but as familiar with Irish questions in his capacity of aide-de camp to a Lord-Lieutenant-a posi. tion which he long filled, we believe, to the great advantage of Dublin society-would make an admirable Irish Secre tary. He is a Liberal of the most genuine character. We believe that he would at once make the effort to settle the tenant.right question; and his opinions about the Irish church establishment are well known." BMeanwhile it appears that speculation in the case has been at fault, and the Dublin journals now say that the report of xIr. Horsman's resignation is at least premature. The Freeman of this morning, however, insists that the resignation of the Chief Secretaryship was actually tendered to Lord Palmerston, and that for a short time the office was vacant. Here is the story of the affair:- " We believe the difference between Lord Palmerston and the member for Stroud has, for the present, been arranged, and that the public will have the benefit of Mr. Horsman'5 continuance in oflico. The cause of the discontent, we have heard, was the protracted absence of the Chief Secretary during a very critical period, when his direction of the Irish elections was even more necessary to the Government than 1he discharge of his .ordinary duties. Among the very first members returned for Englaad was Mr. Horsman. It was reasonably expected that his mind, relieved from the troubles incident to his own election, would be attracted to Ireland, where 'York was greatly wanted.' But York retired to Scotland to look after his own affairs, leaving Irish candidates and Irish elections to take care of themEelves. Paragraphs in the London journals to the effect that the Irish elections had been mismanaged ruffled the usuaUy good temper of Lord Palmerston, and Mr. Horsman was asked for an explanation. What nay have transpired we know not; but the upshot was a determination on the part of Mr. Rorsman to vacate his office. This resolution Mrst appeared in the Sotsman, and our London correspond. ent confirmed the resignation, with the additional fact that Mir. Bernal Osborne was to be his successor. How. ever, for the present Mr. Horsman retains the office. We are not aware that. his presence could have contributed more than Lis absence to render the result of the Irish elections very different. Government was very well though quietly Berved by an Irish nobleman and gentleman, both skilled in electioneering practices. We may, in justice to Lord Carlisle, remark that the zeal attributed to him by the 3rish Tory party was far less fervent than they describe. le was not insensible to the necessity of seeking additloPal support for his Government, but he did not play the frin tic trich which Tory imagination has conjured up in the shape Of 'Ylceregal canvassers thronging the courts of justice, the public-offlces, nd ball-rooms,' and ' 200 barristers, at the ve least,' issuing forth on a grand scurry through the lleys of Dublin. The less the Tories say of compulsion of. voters the better. . The Irislx county elections record the constitutional delicacy of many a Conservative landlord." TEE TIPPERARY BANK. One of the Dublin tade reports remarks that the case of this miserable swin.dle is every day becoming more hopeless, and that a strong opinion is entertained in many quarters that if matters go on as they are proceeding at present the first dividend of 2s. will be a final one.

TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES I Sir,-I did not see until to-day your paper of the 16th, in which I am charged by "Young America" with erroneous statements. Now, the Niagara is certainly about to make a trial, without her armnnent, and to test her fitness for the service in whioh sbe is to be employed; but it cannot be the first, as she made one when fitted with her engines some months ago, when the New York journals reported her speed at 11A knots. I am aware that the 'United States Covernment are building the vessels he refers to, but on lines similar to the Merrimac, &c., and therefore unlike the Niagara, which he has himself called a ship of quite a different class. I have not asserted the Diadem to be more heavily armed than the Merrimac, but have said that she has 2010-inch guns and 2 68Ws, while the Merrimac has only 2 10-inch. The Diadem is to carry 32 guns, not 36 or 42, and 10 of them are only 45 cw t. 32-peunders. ie then proceeds most absurdly to compare his own ship's length over nll, and tonnae American, with the Diadem's length between perpendiculars, and tonnage English, thus reaing her appear larger by 60 feet and 1,400 tons. I subjoin a more accurate table. lIerrimao. Diadem. Length between perpendiculars... 256ft. 6in. 240ft. Extreme breadth ...5... . 61 4 48 Tonnage, English ... ... 3,100 (?) 2,479 The Merrimac is six feet shorter than the Wabash, and only lGft. Gin. longer than the Diadem. I suppose her length for tonnage," as we measure it, to be about 22ft which gives about 3,100 tons. All descriptions of her agree in remarking that her guns must be much lighter if increased to 60, for a reason which every one at all conversant with ahipe of war knows,-namely, that they are liable to be severely strained by carrying, and, above all, discharging too great a weight of metal. I am not so utterlv unacquainted with the American navy as to imagine tlhe old Oonstitution, built in 1797, a steamer. lIer luck, I believe, consisted in capturing an English frigate greatly inferior in guns, crew, and tonnage; or, perhaps, in running out of Boston at night to elude the Shannon and Tenedos, although, in company with the New York, 48, equal to either of them. I would recommend "Young America," before calling another's statements erroncous, to be sure that he understands his own; and begging to apologize for the length of this letter, am, Sir, .8 A ~~Your obedient servant, H.

Tim DEPOPULATION OF FRANCE.-The massacres of the first Revolution and the wars of Napoleon may suf'iciently account for the diminution of the French population up to a recent date, but a new cause is now in operation, tending powerfuliy to the same result. The old frugality of the French has been banished by the present rigissc, and luxury and extravagance are now the prevailing habits. Saving and hoarding are at an end, and people live up to their means, if notbeyondtheir means. In Paris the Immense increaso of handsome equipages must strike every eye, and the other signs of enlarged expenditure are abundant. Women, whoplay soprominentand important a part in the affairs of France,have of course taken the lead in this 3ew fashion of extrs,vagance, and many of them do not think it unreasonable to devote a third of their husbands' income to their own toilettes. And this is not con. fined to Paris; it runs tbrough the whole country, and every provincial town is a 'Paris in miniature in the features of a niew luxury and extravagance; and the freer indulgence in every sort of enjoyment is concurrent with a universa ly aug. mented cost of living. A French authority, who has written on the subject of the high house-rents of Paris, attributes that enhancement, not to the demolition of old buildings, but to the new habits of expense which have sprung up within the last few years; and if this be the fact in Pans, it will also account for the advance of prices throughout the provinces. The subdivision of property, whatever may belts merits in other respects, lends its aid to the general propensity for extravagance. A young man, a younger brother, gets hislittle shareof property, and launches atonce into the pleasure it may place within his reach. Hegoes up to Paris with a few hundred or thousand francs, and spends his capital as if it were*an income. He is asked after by some one who has net Iim in better days, and the stereotyped answer is, " He has disappeared." There are oublieUes in society for these prodigals. Sotme find their way to Africa, where they carry muskets; some to the gaol; some to the bottom of the Seine. None recover by industry the footing lost by extravagance. Famiiilies do not generally run the road to ruin so fast. They follow the fashion of expense by living fully up to their incomes, and the husband endeavours to extend the means of enjoyment by a little gambling under the commercial name of speculation. One prudence only is observable, and that is in avoiding the charges incidental to a number of children. The saying so common in England, " where Heaven sends mouths it sends meat," is unknown in France, and thenumber of mouths to be fed is adjusted strictly to the means of feeding them. A husband and wife have one or two children, or none at all, as Dwe Tines observes, according to their ideas of what they can afford. Of course, then, in proportion to the enlarged expenditure for objects of luxury and show is the circumscribed space for the n,ursery. The stables cut into it, the coach-house cuts into it-above all, Madame's toilette. Where you would see with English habits half-a-dozen healthy boys and girls walking with their parents, you see instead in the Bois de Boulogne a fine lady in a handsome open carriage. The horses, the coachman, the footman, are in lieu of the children. Everything cannot be afforded. A choice must be made, and we see what it is. The preferred issue of the Prench couple are their own favourite pleasures-.dress, eqmpages, good living, gambling. Children would narrow the means for these enjoyments, or leave for them no means whatever, therefore children are not born to curtail their parents' pleasures, and the want of them is not felt where alU is given to the gratification of vanity and the senses. The drawing-room, the dinine-room, the promenade, and the theatre fill every moment and satisfy every wish; or it is only when these things stale and pall that a desire ariss for the new plaything of a boy or a girl, Of cours, there are exceptions to these habits, and here and there will be found families with domestic enjoyments, but the number of them has been much diminiqhed by the order or disorder of extravagance so countenanced and encouraged by the p resent dynasty. The evil is not c'onfined to the wealthy classes ; it ldeeneds througth al classeswwith modification of sir umstances The ihopkeeperandhis wife, the artisan and hisvfe ae all for ~thevntissdA enjoymaent within their reach as much as the millionaire and s wife. The occupation for the thoughts which politics once provided being gone, thd general pursuit now is pleasure, and the means of obtainfng it. Sy hook or by crook, generally on the miry field of the 'Bourse. In sucKi a state of things there must be a tendency to every sort of degeneracy, moral and physical; and we may expct to gee the French nation, under the sway of its n intensel selfish vices, dwindhng more than under the jllotine of the Terrorists or the desultory wars of the fist Nlapoleon. Rer declining population is the reproachful record against her.-Rxamsier.
THB STAFF. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,-Having recently perused the excellent report made by the three commissioners sent abroad list year to inquire into thestate of military education in France, Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia, I confess that I read withf surprise and reget the general order signed by the Adjutant-General, 'which appeared in youlr column onthe 17~th inst., detailing the quali/ications which will be required from British staff officers after the :1st of January,. 1868. To serve on the Staff is the legitimate ambition of every officer. The pay is double that of regimental officers; the chances of promotion and distinction more than double; the life pleasanter and easier. These advantages and privileges are most reasonably assigned to Staff officers, in order to secure for that important branch of the military profession the very best men in the service. In foreign armies, the commissioners tell us, the capacity and acquirements which a Staff officer possesses are ascertained by a series of winnowings, as it were, which separate effectually the dull and the ignorant from the energetic and the well instructed. In France, for instance, a candidate for Staff employment in the first instance enters and leaves the Polytechnic or St. C(yr by competition; he next wins his way into and out of the Ecole d'EtatMajor by conpetition. In those two educational establishments he spendsfour of the best years of his life in severe and successful study. The order inwhich thestudents emerge from those schools is recorded as formally and publicly as is the position of the first, second, and third class men at our Universities. It is assigned by a mixed board of distinguished soldiers and civilians. The successful student is then attached to a regiment of infantry for two years, to a regiment of cavalry for two years, to the artillery for one year, and, finally, at the age of 27, he is pronounced competent for Staff employment, and he is o0. With this example before our eyes, and with equally good examples afforded us by Austria, Sardinia, and Prussia, it would seem that our Minister of War proposes to limit the new scheme of Staff education, as far as aides-de-camp are concerned, to two years' service with either infantry or cavalry, to English composition, to a good colloquial knowledge of one modern language, to a faculty of producing an intelligible sketch of a country, to a knowledge of the use of the pocket sextant, of regimental duty, tactics, field movements, and field fortification. It is not stated whether the competitive element is to be in future admitted in the assignmert of Staff employment, or whether a young man, having, as heretofore, obtained his position on the Staff by good family interest, is merely to be caOled upon to show that he possesses a smattering of the above enumerated list of military accomplishments. If there is to be no competition the plan will as certainly fail as the plan for obtaining better educated officers for the cavalry and the Line failed during the late war. No man without interest will care in peace time to qualify himself by hard study for a prize for which he well knows he will not be allowed to start; and when a war breaks out, instead of having at hand a number of highlyeducated soldiers who have been struggling for these professional prizes, we shall find ourselves, as we found ourselves in 1854, without any means of ascertainingt before we have lost an army, who are the fittest in n to be intrusted with the care of it. In all foreign countries, too, the education of the Staff officer is completed before he is intrusted with Staff duties of any kind; from the ablest of the aides-de-camp, the Quartermaster and Adjutant Generals' Staffs are recruited without further instruction or examination. But the plan now propounded by the Minister of War involves the necessity of fresh studiesand fresh examinations before the aide-dc-camp can pass on to the higher branches of Staff duty,-a condition which in wartime must be disregarded altogether, and which even in peaetimue would be absurd and inconvenient. It is stated that the acquirements and the competency of our fiiture Staff officers are to be decided upon by a single General officer, and a most distinguished and accomplished soldier has been named for the task-probably the very best man that could have been selected. But it is a task which no one single man can possibly discharge, either to his own satisfaction or to that of the country. The young officers who will obtain Staff appointments m peace time will generally be those who have the best interest ; for how is it to be expected that any General officer should, for any length of time, successfully resist the social pressure which will be brought to bear upon him if he does his duty conscientiously-if he debars the sons, nephews, and cousins of men and -women in high places from double pay, double promotion, and easy lives, merely because, in his opinion, their colloquial French is below the average, or because in his eyes their scrawls of Hounslow-heath and Virginia-water are unintelElgible? And if, as isnot impossible, he should be driven from his post, and a weak, an incompetent, or a jobbing General officer should succeed hixn, the Staff of the British army would in a very short time be rendered inefficient for years. The proposed plan, as indicated by this general order, appears to me to be neither more nor less than a clumsy attempt to reconcile the efficiency of the public service with the retention of Horse Guards patronage, which is impossible. Competition alone will collect the best men in the army, will put them on their mettle, will test them accurately, will secure the foremost of them for Staff situations in peacetime, and will register the value of the remainder for war consumption. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. 0.
THE LOINIDON CLUBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMEES. Sir,-In company with other people of taste, public %irit, and enligtenment, ou have occasionally considered e subject on which I am about to addrets a few observations to yov,-I mean the most expedient way of adorning and beautifying our metropolis. It must strike every one who at al considers the subject, that we do not keep pace with the rest of the world in those architectural works both of a publio and private nature which make the ornaraents and attraction of a great capital such as London. Paris I sball not bring into the questson ; it present state I consider forced, exotic, and unstable. But we ardly keep our place among the second-rate oapitals of Europe, and Brussels, Dresden, and Munich may venture to compete with the richesBt oi in the world. "Ohl" says the Lon oner, " look at our els."" I do look at our clubs, and It Is on that subject that I propose to trouble you with a few words. It is remarkable that while both parties political have contributed magnificent edifices towards the decoration of the metropo]is and their opinions ; while the Conservatives can ow with pride two splendid piles, and the Liberals at least one handsome one; while the army and navy have recentlty completed a third palace-the most successful of the thiee they can boast; while the Universities, the sciences, even our Indian empire come forward, the fashion. able clubs (if I may be allowed the expression), the aristocratic clubs do nothing for the general aspect of London, and have made no move in a direction where they ought to have been first. Can anything be more paltry than that bow-window from which the members of White's contemplate the cabstand and the Wellington Tavern and yet a little management might make that house worthy of its unparalleled situation; and, if it were extended to Piccadi71y, it would be the finest thing of its kind in Europe. Surely a judicious expenditure of the funds of the society might carry out some scheme of this kind. Again, the Travellers is worse than Whits, and looks very like a sandwich at the Swindon station-a small stumpy piece of beef between two hu;ge pieces of bread; i.c., the Athenieum and the Reform Clubs, which look as if they were urging their migratory neighbour to resume the peregrinations for whica its members are remarkable. Yet people have their naines down 10 years at the Travellers previous to their coming up for ballot. An election reasonably extended would suppy funds for a moro advantageous and extended position. I will not occupy your space by a more comprehensive cmiticism. Axtbur's is bad, and Boodle's ludicrously ugly. Yet fine positions are not wanting. Hlarding's shop, now for sate, is a fine site; Bnekingham-house still finer;* and many would turn up wlith Offers if they were only sought for. But it is remarkable that whlethe army, the navy, the country, the Guards, the niversities, aln contribue, aristocratic London does Dothing to bceautify itself, - -- I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

TO THR RDITOB OF THE TIMfES. Sir,-The question of accidents in coal mines has, at all events, had the advantage of a thorough ventilation. Eminent professors of every branch of science have propounded their specifies ; Parliamentary committees have reported voluminously on abstract theories of ventilation ; Legisative enactments have instituted a system of mining inspection, which is at the least not wanting in an attention to detail ; yet so utterly futile have been all these various attempts that we can scarcely take up a newspaper without fearing to find somehoribe narrative of " Another Colliery Explosion," in which so many are reported to be dead, and so many to be mangled or burnt; but how the explosion originatod there is no evidence to show. When i2e Times takes upasubjeet we Degin to hope that some practical good may ensue, and r b .elve the leader in yourpaper of the 17th indicates the true direction in which we must look for the remedy. The objection of miners to the "safety " lamp is not simply on account of the less quantity of light emitted, but because they are unable with equal facality to throw the rays on the exact spot required in their different operations. The "clanny" lamp has merely a cylinder of glass around the flame. There are several other kinds of glass lamps which give a light equal or superior to that of the ordinary pit candle. After all, the preference arises more from habit than from actual saperiority of the one over the other. It is frequently the case that miners who are accustomed to the use of larmps prefer the ordinary Davy to any other form, from the fact of its being more manageable and a better indicator of the presence of "fire." One would imagine that, having the means of comparative, if not of absolute safety already provided, the first step of the Legislature would be to apply those means to a. cases in which explosive gases were acertainedto be evolved in dangerous quantities. Bat in this, as in everything else, it would be without precedent to go at once to the heart of the eviL The Coal Mine Inspection Act of 1855 is admittcI on all hands to be a failure. By this Act the entire organization of the operations of every colliery is practicaUy placed under Government controL The inspectors of coal mines have been urged on to an interference with de. tail, bordering on the vexatious. If the control so exercised has been found ineffectual to check the recurrence of the awful calamities to which I have referred, either it must be that the difficulties are insuperable, or there is something radically wrong in the system of inspection as at present caried out. For my own part, I believe the latter to be the ease. We have been dealing with the details of a great question, to the neglect of the principles involved. There is a pitiful absurdity in the particulars of a trial which took place at Merthyr a few weeks ago, at the very period of the terrible accident at Lundhill, in which the Government prosecuted the Dowlais Iron Company for not having applied to their steam-boilers what the inspector considered to be the best kind of water-uage. The trial occupied several davs. Scientific evidence was produced m abundance. Both parties contested the question with the most pugnacious tenacity; but, in the end, it was decided that the Dowlais Company were right and Her Majesty's government was wrong. Ithought one of the first principles of wise legislation was to avoid unnecessary interference with the operations of private enterprise mn matters of opinion. As regards their liabiUty to explosion, all coal mines may be included in one of the three classes following :-L. Safe, -being those in which no explosive gas has been found to exist; 2. Ordinary,-those in which no explosion can occur, unless under exceptional conditions; 3. Fiery,-including all colhieris in which fire-damp is liable to accumulate in daugerous quantity, or to be discharged in such volame as to render the ordinary current of air explosive. The collieries belonging to the first of these classes mi ht be worked exclusively with " naked lights ,' the second with naked lights, subject to proper regulations for the use of safetylamps, where the absence of the air current or other peculiar conditions may indicate the necessity of unusual caution. The third should be worked exclusively with locked safetylamps, and such additional precautions as the character of the seam may require. The onus of proof of the class to which any particular oflliery belongs should rest with the owner. In the event of an explosion attended with serious loss of life oecurring in any colUery of the second claes, such eolliery to be transferredtothe third class, unless the explosion can be satisfactorily eccounted for. Cases of dispute should be settled by arbitration. Where the explosion has arisen from removeable causes, any workman sustaining serious resonal injury, or the representatives of any workman led, to h .ve a speCial right of action against the owner of the c3lliery in which the accI1dent may have occurred, and to rocover damages in proportion to the injury sustained. -The classification of coal mines was originally proposed in a pamphlet which I have before me, purporting to be a letter addressed to Lord Palmerston, while Home Secretary bDy Mr. J. KRenyon Blackwfell, a gentleman to wvhom wre are Indebted for many valuable suggestions on the subject of *,olliery ventilation. This question is one which, for the sake o' humanity we ougjht not to let alone. T2he increase in the do th at wr6ioh our ams of coal are worked, ad the still morerapid inerease in the quantity raised from a sinzle opening by the application of isproved machinery, tend every day o produce a greater evolution of explosive gas, tnd therefore t augment the danger. If nothing better can be devised than the present system of ofticious interference with detail by Government employ&s, we have but to look forward to a yet more fearful mortality than hs hitherto obtained. I have endeavoured to showv how the suggestion thrown out by you may be applied in a practical form, and am not without a hope that your interposition may lead to some modifi. cation of the existing law, by which the matter wll be dealt with in the comprehensive manner which its Import, anee deserves.

It will be recolected thatd their previous sitting h jury adjourned to the 30th inst., ana conse. uently werespechlly s tuionedto new he bodies to0-dy. The following evdence vas adduced Jo hn Warhurst, a denity, eaid that he, Mr. Brown, Kr *James Beaumont, Wi 'am Be6vers, and John South, de. scended the pit about . o'clock that (Saturday) morano in consequence of being informed by other persons rho icd )ustpreviouslybeen down that bodleswore floatigneg f the bottom of the downcast shatft. They found three bo4ies floating a little to the north of the shaft, and brought thes "to bank" (out of the pit). Tha bodies were then placed in coffins and removed to the thed erected for theit reoeption. Two of the bodies he could not recognize, but the other he believed to be that of a'miner named Thomas Gray. Harriet Gray, widow of Thomas Gray, late of Weot Melton, miner, aged 22 Tears, gaid her husband went to work at the Lundhih colliery early on the morning of the explosion, and did not afterwards return home. She had seen one of the three bodies recovered from the nit that (Saturday) morning, and believed it to be that of her hus- band. She knew it from a large wart betwreen the thumb. and forefinger of the left haud. Her husband was in She habit of wearing a leather belt round his body when at Henry GrAy had also examined the same boDsy, and believed it to be that of his brother Thomas Gray, the husband of the last witness. He knew it by the belt round the body, and the wart on the left hand. Hannah Cutts, of Lundhill (who has lost a husband and three sonsby the explosion), said she was the widow of John Cutts. She had not seen any of the bodi6s secovered that morning, but had got a sergeant of police to out apiece of corduroy from the top of the trousers of one of them. She was certain from the unfinished state of the button holes in it and from the sewing that the piece of corduroy was part of a pair of trousers which she had made either for her eldest son William Cutts or her youngest son George Cutts -she could not tell which. Wiliam Beevers and John South were called to confirn the evidence of Warhurst, and stated in addition that thie boaies here arbially clothed when taken from the pit, and that thby be'aved one was the body of Thomas Gy. The otber bodies, apart from their clothing, were not in a state to be identified. Nothing was known as to whose the third Mr. M. T. Saddler, of Barnsley, surgeon, was calUed to say that death had resulted from the explosion, but whethor from suffocation or being burnt he was unable to say. The coroner and jury then proceeded to view the bodies, which were lying in coffns in the shed erected for their roception. They were carefully packed and covered, onzs the countenances, which, as was to be exjected, wrere much distorted, being exposed to view. Thainfeotants having been used there was no disagreeable smell perceptible in the On the return of the jury to the offices, 3fr. John Johnson, the foreman, said,-I would respeotfully and humbly submit to the coroner that the view of bodies nowr ade hv the jury is amply sufficient for all the purpowes of the inquest. To my mind, and I think I may speak for my fellow jurors, the identity of Gray is satisfactorily established. I think it is a matter of the greatest importmnce that the bodies of the remainder of the poor untortunate eratures who have perished by the explosion should be interredimmediately they are recovered, that no injury may arlse to those who reside in the district, and that the feelings of the relatives may be as much spared as possible. I also think that any further evidence which it may be necessary to. have with regard to identity may be adduced before the jury at their sitting liko the rest of the evidence. Under these circumstances, I trust the coroner will relieve the jury from the unpleasant and revolting task of further viewing the bodies. In this matter I believe I am giving utterance to the sentiments of tho jury generally. (Hear, hear.) I wish It to be perfectly understood that the jury do not desire, and wlnl not shrink to the extent of one iota from their duty as jurors, but they are of opinion that for them to view any more of the bodies is not at al wessential to the ful and thorogh investigation of the matter. On the contrary, I kitls whollyuseless and unnecessary. I therefore hope that the jury will not be summoned to view more of The Coroner remarked that an inquest was not legal except on view of the body, and he was afraid he must summon the jury to viev some other bodies which could be more clearly identified than even that of Gray. It was not for him to say what might be the verdict of the jury, and if it was one of manslaughter against any of the parties con. nected with the pit he did not think the present identification would stand the test of cross-examination. It was expected that all the water would be emptied out of the pit by Monday (this day), and that during this week a number of the bodies wouli be recovered from the highest levels of the pit. These bodies would not have been reached by the water, and it was anticipated would be much more capable of identification, and he must trouble the jury to meet once more to view four or five of those bodies which could be clearly identified. Yrom the use of disinfectauts there was no unpleasant smel perceptible in viewing the bodies, and he should have to run the same risks in the matter as the jury. The Foremau said his objection had not reference so much to any risk the jury might run in viewing the bodies as to the eils that might result from keeping the bodies uninterred for the purpose of being viewed. The sooner the bodies were interred after their recovery the better, and the identity might be established through witnees. Mr. Gallaud, one of the proprietors of the 'it, in re to the coroner, said it was expected that most ol the bodies would be recovered during next week. The Foreman.-I must say that It is unnecessary to in. sist upon any further inspection of bodies by the jury; and you must excuse me saymg that I belive if Sir George Grey had been appealed to, he would have relieved the jury from the necessity of viewing the bodies at all. The Coroner.-Sir George Grey has nojPOwer to alter the law. The Foreman thought Sir George Grey had power to deal specially with so important a case, and that he ouldhave done SO. The Coroner said he would spare the feelings of the jury as much as possible in the matter. The inquest was then adjourned to the 30th inst. On Friday Messrs. Nicholas Wood and the other eminent engineers by whom the present operations are being directed met to eonsult as to the next steps to be taken. The main point upon which future proceedings hinge is the extinction or otherwise of the fire. Various tests were applied bearing upon this point, and, among other things, the temperature of the water in the pit was tried, and found to be about 56 deg. Fahrenheit. The results obtrined by the tests were generally of a favourable character, and little doubt is entertained that the fire is extinguished. The results, however, were not such as to place the matter beyond all question; and, as the renewal of the flames and a further explosion might result from the reventilation of the pit before the fire is entirely extinguished, it was deemed necessary to obtain the most decisive evidenco possible on the point. With this view Mr. Coo, the viewer at Lundhill, Mr. Maddison, andother colliery viewers descended the pit about 8 o'clook on Friday evening, in the hope of being able to ford the water at the bottom of the shaft to the higher levels, and thus explore those parts of the pit where the fire had raged. They found the water at the bottom of the shaft about four feet deep, which was more than they anticipated. They, however, waded to the nearest board. gate to the rise, and attempted to penetrate it, but found that it was altogether obstructed from the roof having f,llen, no doubt as a consequence of the fire. They then attempted to pursue the level until they reached the next turn to the rise, but from the increased depth of the water were compelled to return after wading about 40 yards. They were enabled to reach the stables and some other parts of the pit within 40 yards from the shaft, and found that much roof had fallen in all directions, but were unable to penetrate to the parts where the fire was likely to be stiU existing, in case it should not be wholly extingeished. In consequence it was determined to proceed with the operation of emptying out the water until Monday, when it is expected that a further attempt to explore the pit will be made. The engineers will reassemble on Tuesday to decide upon the next proceedings. It was from the information obtained in the attempted exploration on Friday evening that the three bodies were recovered on S-turday morning. As might be expected, the bodies were much decomposed and considerably mutilated. As intimated above, it is pretty confidently anticipated that many of the bodies will be recovered during this week. wore poprivetors hahve invited volunteers to assist in the oror recovery, and the invitation has been numerously responded to.- MOarDA. The preparations for the recovery of the bodies are in full progress. The operation of draining the mine has been continued since Saturday. The water has been considerably rednucedl, and everything appears favourable for the exploration of the mine. Yesterday the three bodies which were recovered on Saturday were interred in the preqeno of a great crowd of persons. The bodyof Thomas Gray was interredat Worth the others were placed in the large graves in Darfield ch_rchyard. The cnbical position to which affairs have been brought has caused the excitement to increase to a great extent, and the neighbourhood of Lundhill was crowtdwvith people during the whole of yesterday. This day, in consequence of the notices which had been issued, the men who have volunteered to descend the mine and assist in tho search for the bodies assembled at the offices of the company, where their names were taen down. They were mostly experienced men. Some of them had come fromn Wigan, in Lancashire- others from Claycross and AIfreton, in Derbyshire. ?iey numbered over ioo. Yesterday Mir. Coo, tho manager of tho pit, along with several other experienced men, descended into the rine and endeavoured to penetrate the workings, for the purpose of ascerAining beyond doubt that the firewas extinguished. They succeeded in penetrating a little further than on Saturday, hut the roof had fallen dowvn to such a degree that they were not able to reach the more distant points to which the fire had extended.

GENgRAL BRAT.SON AND COLONEL SRHIAY. TO THE EDITO OE op TE TIMES. Sir,-A letter of Colonel Shirley's ha been published in your pafer of this day, in w-hich he states that the deeisioa of the Court upon the charges I preferred a ainst him has completely exonerated him from those charges, That letter covers a Copy of those charges and of the dec Won. In slating that this decision has been a " refutation of the charges anda complete exoneration of the character of an officer of 27 yeare' service," he seems to have overlooked the circumstance that this Court, of whose decision Iii his favour he boasts, has, in the answer to the first question, stated that he did make the private inquiries I charged him with; and, in the answer to the fourth, that hl6 laduiot received any evideno to warrant his making the statement affecting me so strongly; in fact, that he greatly exaggrateL the tale that had been told hims. I do not object to the course he has pursued in publishin thedecisionef the Court; in factIbave every reason X wish for publicity, and I am very glad that Colonel Shirley has himself courted that aid from the public press which he in his address to the Court charcrized as udsoldierlikea y Part. tm But, Sir, what I do and did object to is that the -proCfedsa s of that oourt houldhavebeen secret The ieonle of En Id have a natural repugnance to such tirib.na, sd I do not think that when I have published (as I mea to do) a narrative of the proceedings of this Court, and the subsance (so well as I can recollect them) of the JudgeAdvocate-Genersl's instructions, as well as the evidence, on which-tey have arrived at the strne decision they-have rolmulgated-I do not think, I say, that that feeling wil It may be asked why I did not protest against a secret court, after having for a year demanded " a full public aud searching investigation." I answer, I had no alternative, the War minister haying shown a determination to conceal the name of m cser; and we should have had no inquiry at all if 7h5d objected to the closed Court; and even from that we have got some good. The name so pertinaciously concealed by Lord anmure has been at length divulgedU. I shall now proceed to remark upon the decision of the Court, and in oing so I shall refer to the statements made before it to show how little that decision accords with justice or with those rules of evidence with which the President indeed professed himself to be unacquainted. The first question lays down fairly enough my charge against General Shirley. I do not object to it, nor to the first part of the decision of the Court, but when that bedy of gentlemen, notwrithstanding Brigadier-General Watt's statement to them that Colonel Shirley made no communict(ion to him on the subject, give it as their opinion that making inquiries regarding a matter closely affecting thelife and honour of a former commanding officer without the knowledge of the offioer commanding at the time, who would most probably have taken means to vindicate the fair fame of his former friend,-when they say that such proceedings were not secret or underhand, I am certainly astonished. This concealment of his proceedings from General Watt makes his conduct " secet and underhand." Had Colonel Shirley fairly stated to the officer commanding the force tht such a report had been radeto himIwouldnot only have acquitted himn of slndering me, hut have been deeply gratefhl to him HIad he invesfigated its truth, the result -would have 'eeen the full1 exoneration which Lord Paumure against his wiU wsTi obliged to give me aftertwo courts had been held at Shumla, and the influence of his Lordship and my other friends had failed to make the case good against me. The second and third questions seem to have been framed by the Judge Advocate-General with a view to making my charges against Colonel Shirley fail on sorne poiuts, and thus afford an excuse for refusing a court-martial. ColonelShirley may have thought hr. Skene's statement a reasonable cause; but having read the statements made at the two courts held at Shumla and having seen by the testimony of the two witnesses on whom his charge rested that ArL-. Skene's statements were utterly false, he was, as a gentleman, on his own motion bound to have givenL up the author, and as he refused to do this when I applied to him I was obliged to suppose he had none. The answer to the fourth question is ambiguous, but I understand that the meaning the Court wished to convey is that Colonel Shirley had received his information from Mr. Skene, and that that gentleman's position justified him in attaching such belief to his statement as to require he should forward it. Now, I am at issue with the Court on thlt conclusion. It appears from the evidence prcduced before it that Colonel Shirley knew Mr. Skene's statement to be merely hearsay, and that one of the officers, iLientenant-Colonel Sankey, mentioned by that gentleman as his arthority, called upou Colmnel Shirley and told hirm that he understood he had been namned as authority for certaim st:tements affecting General Beatson, and that those statements were not true. Having received this contradiction. of a part of Mr. Skene's tale, it was his duty, in conjunction with Brgadier-General Watt, the officer commanding the force, to have endeavoured to ascerta'in the truth by questiOniDg Lieu-enant.Colone1 O'Reilly, who was then at The statement was in itself so mionstrous that its impro bability was a reason to doubt it, but there -was a cause in the background which the evidence before the Court disclosed-viz., Colonel Shirley's motive in adopting Mr. Skene's tale. His own rwords show wrhat that motive ws:"One thing I have learnt from Air. Skene, which I think you ought to know if you do not know it already, as I hear Beatson intends to bring his case before Parliament." (Here follow the charges made by Colonel Shirley.) This extract from his letter to General Vivian shows why MIr. Skene's tale was listened to so readily, and perhaps the motive for not communicating on the subject with BrigadierGeneral Watt; that officer would undoubtedly have advertised me of the slander, and I should have been prepared to disprove the charge had it been made in the House of Commons as an answer to my complaint. I cannot a,ree withtheConrt in its opimon, as enunciated inthe answer to the third question, that Colonel Shirley was bound notto "prosecute the inquiry further." Having examined already two officers, and their statements having contradicted Mr. Skene's, he was bound, always associating Brigadier-General Watt with him in his inquiries, to have tested the truth further by examining Lieutenant-Colonel O'Reily. The Court seem to have adopted Colonel Shirley's excuse that the superior rank of the officer Im ted vented him from continuing his inquiries, wvithoutrOe ing that the srme reason should have influenced him in a still higher degree in not disseminating slanders about him. With regard to the answer to the sixth question I have only to say that if Colonel Shirley did not know the statements to be untrue his perceptions must have been strangely blunted by the desire of finding them true. The seventh question is almost the only oDe that is fairly founded upon my charges as Colonel Shirley. My third charge accuses Colonel Shirley of suppressing the evidence whic told in my favour, and the decision of the Court is (as, indeed, it generally Is) at variance with the evidence produced before it. mlr. Skene in his evidence states he gave Lieutenant-Colonel Sankey as one of his authorities for the shtements. Ieeutenmnt-olonel Sankey declares to Colonel Shirley that the statementsare untrue, yet Colonel Shirley forwards Mr. Skene's report while he suppresses Colonel Sanlceg's denial of it. Ad all this was statedi in. evidence before the Court. I do not ask the public toform their Judgment from this statement; it is my intentioni to nublish. from notes taken during the proceedings, the evin'e l said before this Court, as well as- those held at I have repeatedly applhied for a copy of the proceedings. which has hitherto been refused to me ; but shaUl not cease from my efforts until I have ull uh.icity ; and m letters requesting that Mr. Skene should be detained in ths country to meet the charges I was about to prefer against him were unattended to until he left the country. When the instructions of the Judse-Advocate-General are published it will be seen that they violate the rales by which such Courts have hitherto been guided, with the object of hampering my proooedins and exonerating Colonel Shirley. I have the highest opinion of the members of the Court individually, but at tae sme time I must say that in allo g themselves to be led by the instructions ofthe Judge-Advocate, whose natural bias would be to screen the War Minister, they have not shown that independenoe which the publio had a right to expect from officers of Vleir rank and character. I challenge the production of the proceedings and of all pa pera laid before the Court; let there undergo the test of public opinion thron,,h thle prs. I have nothing toTfea from publicity. Can mr adversaries say the rame ? Pablie Opinmon versus Secret Tribunals. I look to the result witlh perfect confidence. W. F. BE&TSONI. 1beVnant.OmbraL No. 2, Bennett-etree, St. Jame es, April 20.

LONDON, T2UESDAY, APRtL 21, 1857. In matters of war, whether by land or by sea, all nations are superstitious. The smallest thing is supposed to be significant in an affair in which accident rules alternately with inteUect, in which mnyriads bow to a strong will, and a moment mnakes the difference of life and deatb, victory or disaster. The Romans were a brave people, but they were not ashamed of a misgiving if the standard stuck in the ground, if the eagle feU off, if the General tripped, or if even the beasts of burden showed a repugnance to the w6rk. So, why need we hesitate to confess our annoyance at the information that General AASlBURNHA vwas nob two days at Malta without being taken with the fever of the place, and that he was not able to be present at the parade ordered in his honour? But why should we magnify a trifle like this, which might happen to anybody ? It is true that almost everybody has some ailment or other on stepping at once into a new climate and soil; but we could name many people who have done this scores of times, and have neveer once been hinderedl a day's sightseeint, or a day's travelling, or a day's business or pleasure in consequence. General ASHBtrRNHAM leaves England and turns up at Malta. This is his first visible step towards China, 'and at his first reappearance he is unable to sit on horseback and hold aw review. One is reminded that in the last China war three Generals died in the first year of decay of nature; and other wars have been interrupted iit limine by the not extraordinary circumatance that gentlemen accustomed totake the greatest catre of their health at home have not been able to do- 4o on active service abroad, under a tropical sun, ii muddy rivers, in rice-fields, in forced marches, &Ud close camps. General ASHBUBNEAHf, however, is not an old man, nor is he, as far as we are aware, a valetudinarian; yet this hitoh induces us to ask what he is, or rather what he has been. slia solitary aebievement is that be commanded a .1brigade in the battle of Chiilianwallah, and without showing extraordinary promptitude or ability. When his name was first announced we were suffi- ciently aware that his recommendations were negative; but there is a confessed difficulty in these appointinents. One name had been already mentioned to be dismissed, and it is rather an odious task to ehallenge a whole panel of nominations; yet it was obvious to everybody that in this selection there could be no regard to the rule of evident merit as proved by aotual services. L,ord pAy? M23ERSTON, or Lord PAwnuRB, or somebody else might have a very strong opinion, on grounds very satisfactory to himself, that General AsaBuxNyj was a great General, but he would find it impossible to justify the appointment on grounds within the public knowledge and apprehension. In the sciences this mode of proceeding is called empirical, for it can pretend to no rule; and it can no more be defended in the conduct of a war than in the care of one's bodily health. But the choice of a General of whom little is known, and that little more favourable to his discretion than his valour, is not the only unpromising feature of the preparations in progress. Lord ELoIN is a man of much temper and ability, but his mission in Canada was one of conciliation. His orders were to let the people govern themselves as much as possible. He had to stand some blustering from the Tory malignants, but he had the people on his side, and was, happily, on the best possible terms with the neighbouring Republic. Now, no man, we believe, is more aware of the difference between this mission and the demand of hard terms from China than Lord ELGIx himself, and no man knows better the different qualities required for these two tasks. He wante a man of decision and dash. He wants a man to do what he cannot do himself, and who for this purpose has qualities which he does not himself possess. Two exceedingly discreet men are likely to cherish one another's scruples, and to recognize obstacles that might otherwise vanish of themselves. We respect and we trust a discreet man who knows that he is discreet, and that discretion is not all that is wanted for his work. We have the greatest distrust of that discretion which thinks itself all-sufficient for its work. That, however, is likely to be our case under the joint command of Lord ELGIN and General ASHUXRNHAM, and our only hope is that the greater common sense of the former shows him tha.t something is wanted which he does not find in himself. What makes the deficiency on the military side a more serious affair is, that there are people who assume there is to be no fighting. Lord PALMERSTON does not assume this, for he knows very well that the terms he rstands out for will not be obtained without an appeal to arms. But there are those who tell us this expedition is only an armed Embassy; that we have only to make demonstrations, and we shall carry all before us; and that the Emperor of CHINA will not hazard his throne for the sake of Yzn's Viceroyalty. The truth, however, is that we are not sending a second expedition to China for nothing. We are about to make demands, and are resolved to have them complied with. They are such as the Emperor of CHINA will not concede without positive and painful proof of his inability to refuse them. There will be war, and we confess to a misgiving whether General ASnBU haim is exactlv the man for taking sudden possession of Canton, marching on Pekin, or seizing the three or four new ports to be opened to foreign trade. Nor is this the only question forced upon us. The last war finished but a year ago with a grand display, intended to show that we were prepared either to proceed with that war, if necessary, or at a moments warning to enter on any new one that the honour of the country might impose on us. We had also acquired much experience, but that was a mental gain; here, however, was a material acquisition which could be readily measured, and no one could deny. Twelve months ago we were ready, so it was said, to sail in force to the Crimea or Central America, or anywhere that duty might call us to. Since that time ships and gunboats then in progress have been completed; stores largely drawn on have been recruited; a fleet and an army have come home. Yet now, two months after an expedition was resolved upon, we are only just hearing of first one ship with one regiment, and then another ship with another regiment, going to the East. It will not be till the middle of June that Lord ELGIN will find he has force enough for active operations. It will then be necessary to lose no more time, enough having been lost already, and we shall have to enter on a conflict rather with a tropical climate than with a crowd of barbarians in the hottest season of the year. No one expects anything to be done till July, if even then; but it is fearful to think of the losses we must then expect from the unseen hand of fatigue and disease. It is true there are men who would proceed to business without waiting for the whole of this expected armament, and who would make up for want of preparation by greater daring and despatch; but that is precisely the point in which the expedition chiefly fails, and we are concerned to observe that those who hope most for it do so on the confident assumption that the war opened under one command will speedily be concluded under another, and that we are to trust to seniority, chance, or some other power for a choice of the man to lead our soldiers to victory.
The " Statistical Abstract for the United King" dom in each of the last 15 years from 1842 to "1856," which has lately been published, is a document on which we may congratulate the country. It is, indeed, astonishing that an oldworld region like ours should, after a national life of a thousand years, take so sudden a start and exhibit all the activity, vigour, and material increase which we are apt to associate only with the destinies of a new country, an immigrant population, and an unworked soil. The last 15 years have formed an important period in the history of the British people, for, if these have been illustrated by no striking event except the episode of the Russian war, they have witnessed the change from restricted industry and popular discontent to that freedom of trade and that general wellbeing and satisfaction which distinguish the present time. A cornparison of our condition at the beginning of this period and in its successive years with our condition at present is as complete a proof of the success of liberal legislation as can be needed by any one who is capable of being convinced at all. And, first, as to population. The great catastrophe which ended the long misery of Ireland is fresh in the recollection of every one. The sister island mnst in the course of a few years have lost atleast 1,500,000 inhabitants by famine and emigration. But population in Great Britain has suffered ne check. In 1842 the estimated population of England and Wales was 16,124,000; in 1856 it was 19,044,000; showiDg an increase of nearly 3,000,000 in 14 years. In Scotland the increase seems to have been in the same proportion, the population in 1856 being estimated at 3,033,177. It is probable the total population of the United Kingdom at the present time does not fall far short of 29,000,000. This increase is not only satisfactory but astonishing, when we consider the immense drain of late years by emigration. In 1842 the number of emigrants was comparatively small, and in the next two or three years became much less. For instance, in 1843 tho whole United Kingdom only sent out 23,518 to the North American colonies, 28,335 to the IUnited States, 3,478 to Australia and New Zealand, and 1,835 to other places; total, 57,166. But with the irish scarcity and famaine the rush began. In 1846, 129,851 went; 1in 1847, 258,270; in 1849, 299,498; in 1851 and the three succeeding years the numnbers were 335,996, 368,764, 329,937, and 323,429. Then the tide began to flow with less power. In 1855 the number of emigrants came down to 176,807, and in 1856 it was almost exactly the same-namely, 176,504. Yet in the 10 years ending 1856 we find that the United Kingdom sent out 2,800,000 emigrants, a greater stream that has poured from one country since the modem history of Europe began. It is probable, however, that with the increasing enterp'rise of the country the number who leave its shores will be proportionately less than even during the last two years; and, though Increased facilities of transit and the temptation of acquiring a competence, if not wealth, will continue to tempt men to try their fortune on a new field, we need never look for so alarming an exodtus as that which succeeded the .Irish famine. As to the direction of emigration, we are glad to find that the Australian Colonies keep their groiund in spite of the proximity to us of the United States. The North American Colonies have, on the contrary, somewhat fallen off. The great year for Australian emigration was, of course, 1852, when 87,881 persons set out for the new goldfields. In 1853 the number was 61,401 ; in 1854 it rose to 83,237; in 1855 it was 52,309; and last year, 44,584. We may expect a future emigration of from 40,000 to 50,000 a-year. That the population of the United Kingdom should, in spite of this seemingly exhausting drain, continue to increase is sufficiently explained by the Statistics of Births and Marriages. In 1842 the population of England and Wales was 16,124,000, and the Births 517,739; but in 1856 we find that, with a population of 19,044,000, the Births are 657,000-that is, while the population has increased less tban one-fifth, the nnmber of Births in the year has increased nearly two-sevenths. Thus we learn the very gratifying fact that our population is not only increasing, but actually increasing at a greater ratio than it was 15 years ago, so far as Births are concerned. And the evidence from the return of Deaths is equally cheering, forin 1842theDeathswere 349,519tol6,000,000; in 1856 they were only 391,369 to 19,000,000; or, while the population had increased nearly onefifth, the Deaths had increased little more than oneninth. It is fair, however, to say that last year seems to have been a very healthy one, the Deaths being less in number than in any year since 1850. On the whole, this return of population gives an assurance of increasing power and prosperity which may well encourage the nation to persevere in the policy of recent years. Another fact which proves the prosperity of the country is the great increase of Marriages. In 1842-3 the Marriages were in England and Wales 118,825 and 123,818 respectively; in 1853 they had risen to 164,520, and, though slightly diminished in 1855 by the war, they were 159,000 in 1856. The numnber, then, on an average of years, may be said to have increased one-third from the beginning to the conclusion of the period embraced in the return, while population has increased less than one-fifth. The revenue from Customs and Excise would be tests of the prosperity of the country, were it not for the changes and reductions of duties, which render it impossble to compare the successive years. But in the return of Exports we have a measure by which to estimate the immense progress of the United Kingdom. We doubt whether America itself could furnish a table more marvellous than that which gives the " total declared CC value of British and Irish produce exported from "the United Kingdom" from 1842 to 1856. In 1842 the amount is 47,284,9881.; in 1 845 it has risen to 60,111,0821. ; in 1848, under the influence of European disturbances, it sinksto 52,849,4451.; but from that time the increase is enormous. In 1851 the value is 71,367,8851.; in 1853 it rises to 98,933,7811.' During the next two years the war keeps it stationary, but in 1856 it makes a sudden leap to 115,890,8571., and the first returs of this year predict a still further increase. From 47,000,0001. to nearly 116,000,0001. in 14 years I What a progress do these figures represent, what increase of the national wealth, what an alleviation of the national burdens ! If trade be an index of the wealth of a country, it may be said that the National Debt presses little more than half as heavily as when Sir ROBERT PFEL, a few short years ago, brought forward his first budget. The trading classes, at least, are relieved to a degree which the most sanguine politician could not have anticipated. If we add to these facts what is shown in other tables-namely, that the number of Paupers' has, in spite of increasing population, steadily diminished on an average of years in Great Britain, while the evil has almost vanished in Ireland, we shall have another cause for congratulation. What a descent from the 620,747 receiving relief in Ire- land on the 1st of January, 1849, to the 307,970. of 1850, the 209,187 of 1851, the 106,802 of 1854, until we come to the 56,094 of the present year I We may conclude by once more remarking the great and encouraging fact, that the United Kingdom is not only making progress in population, wealth, and resources of all kinds, but progress in a constantly increasing ratio. This is so much against the theories of the political economists that only the citing of actual returns would make it credible. The usual supposition is, that the ratio of increase in a country continually diminishes, and this is certainly borne out by the annals of continental nations; but, whether permanently or for a term, the United Kingdom is an exception. Every year witnesses a progress more and more accelerated.
The Englishman is an enigma to all the world and to himself on one important point. The same national mind under different conditions presents such exceedingly different characteristics that it is hardly possible to recognize it as the same. It appears to lose its identity altogether. Who could possibly imagine, beforehand, that the power of mind which, as the characteristic of the governing class, controls a fourth of mankind, owned the English cottage as its source; that the " genuine " Englishpeasant," of whom LordRoBsERcxCILgaVe a summary portrait in his speech on education last Wednesday at Stamford, when he said that the " world " presented no specimen of more stolid, invincible, " insuperable ignorance," was the raw material ont of which the English statesman was manufactured ? Is the English labourer a BytyTus, who conceals sagacity under a cloak of the thickest stupidity, till the opportunity arrives which unmasks him, and summons him to important action and the exertion of command? Or is he some exceedingly dull specimen of rough marble, which upon its polish exhibits colours and figures which nobody could have dreamt to be latent in the stone? Or is it that. we apply the wrong test to him, and estimate him according to hisaptness for books, whereas book knowledge is not the secret of our governing power as a nation so much as force of will, boldness, and persevera4ce ? If we examine him more accurately, might we nol' discover, even in the rudest English material, more or less of this composition, only that when we meet with it in the peasant we caU it sturdiness and obstinacy, and when we see it In the English official we call it resolution and moral courage I That distinction between Normian and Saxon which aolvet so many difficultie caot solve this difficulty of the enormous difference between the poor and the governing clsues in this country, first and principally because our states-men and officials are as a class about as much descended from the Normans as they are from the Grecian divinities, and, secondly, because it so happens that the qualities of the English governing mind are always specially characterized as AngloSaxon. But, let us do justice to the English peMant, even as a peasant, and before he has attained his greatness. Everybody who 'knows the practical necessities of our agricultural system-and the same remark, in substance, applies to our manufacturing system-knows the enormous difficulties under which the English peasant labours in the matter of education. The peasant boy is taken away from school often before he has mastered the very first steps in the art of reading, and almost universaly before he has gained anything like facility in it. This is done systematically, and because the wants of his family compel the English labourer to use every source of wages at his command. We justly congratulate the Anglo-Saxon race on its large share of the great bfessing " Increase and mul" tiply," but at the same time it must be distinctly remembered that the large families of our labourers are a prodigious obstacle to the progress of education. They may be almost called thc difflculty. Our labourers have enormous families, for which they must provide bread. The consequence is that they take their children away from the parish school as soon as they can work. There is all the difference between a family of three or four and a family of eight or nine children with respect to the ameunt of wages necessary to keep them. This has been said a hundred times, and the fact has been placed before the public over and over again, but unless persons see these things with their eyes they cannot realize the full amount of the obstruction to education contained in our very system of labour. Nobody can resist such an argument as this. Every clergyman's mouth in this country is stopped when the parent simply tells him that his family cannot live without the wages of the children. In this state of things, then, what is the amount of opportunity left to the labouring boy to finish the work thus abruptly broken off ? It may be very briefly and correctly stated. It consists of the evenings of the winter months-i.e., three, or at the very outside four, months of the year, and those evenings of course greatly impaired by the work of the day. For the rest of the year labour goes on to too late an hour to admit of any evening instruction. But what a wretched system does this present, even when it is taken advantage of-a hlte teaching, and then nine vacant month4 then something learnt again, and then another nine fallow months I Of eourse, besides the small quantity of teaching, a great deal is forgotten in consequence of the interruption of it. The ploughboy pupil, on taking up the thread of what he left off nine months ago, has to begin almost afresh again, and thus education becomes a perpetual start, never getting into a ran, but baulked every time of its natural impetus. Under these circumstances, then, what is the ultimate hope of education in this country ? What is it on which you must fall back at last for the success of any schemes that you may try ? It is one thing, and one thing alone, and that is the desire for education in this class itself. The demand can alone give effect to the supply. People mnay try what plans they like, and plant an adult school in every village, but unless this elass feels its own losa in the want of education, unless there is a decided natural desire to be able to read, just as boys want to be able to ride, or skate, or swim, this class never wiU get over the great difficulties which lie in its way to this object. A real wish to have the power will conquer these obstructions, because where there is a will there is a way, and this alone wiU do it. There must be a sense of the value of this gift, a real notion of what is gained by being able to " read books," an idea, however dim a one, of some world of interesting matter, from which they are cut off by not having this power. This idea must have worked itself into this cla in some decided way before a generation of boys from io to 17 or 20 wil submit to a system of irksome and interrupted calls upon their time and attention-a system which takes up and lays down its task alternately, which harasses by its unsteadiness, and makes the largest demand upon their perseverance at the very time that it gives no help whatever to it. When this idea has once made something like ax entrance into the mind the schoolmaster may take it as a certain augury on his side, as a symptom that the nation is going to be an educated one, just as the doctor tells from the first rise in the patients pulse that he is going to be strong again. This being the symptom, then, that is wanted, 'we are told that it has begun to show itself; that, if we take any chance viUlage boy who has left school before he learnt to read, we shall find him quite up to the advantage of being able to do so. He knows what a book is, and knows what he loses by exclusion from it. The insensibility of the class has at last given way; there is a stir in the mind of the rising labouring population, a sensitiveness on the subject of reading. The great noise that has been made about it has at last, at any rate, ra;sed their standard, and made them feel uncomfortable if they are below it. There has been no lack of zeal and activity among us lately in sprtading education; the difficulty has been the absence of a natural demand for it in the labouring class. Bat this, we sincerely believe, is now growing up.

The Circassian arrived at Halifax on the 6th, after a rapid passage. The Canadian arrived at Portland on the 7th. The screw steamer Clyde sailed from New York for Glasgow on the 7th. The Washington correspondent of the New York Ceurier and EBiuirer states that the question of the reinforcement of the United States' squadron in the East was still umder consideration by the Cabinet and it was believed that a very imposing fleet wil soon be gathered there. It was probable that, in addition to several large steamers and sailing vssels, all the sloops-of-war available from their light draught for that service had already been ordered to the coast of China It was likely that Commodore Perry would be appointed to the general command. In another communication the correspondent of the same journal says *- "It is understood that the Government hu settled upon a line of policy to be pured in regard to China affairs, and that in very recent conference between the Secretry of State and the British 3Minister the latter has expressed his entire satisfaetion with the course which is to be pured. The American merchants, Mr. Forbes, Mr. Appleton, and others interested in the China trade, have aleo, after receiving explanations from the Government, become convinced that it is neither politic nor neoessry that we should co-operate with the Western Pnwers in their Proposed crusade against China and their joint efforts fo extingui8h or limit Russian ascendancy in that quarter but that the Government will seure every importani or desirable end by taking measures for the protection of the persons and property of our citizens, and for the enforcement of the privileges which are secured to us by the existing treaty, acting independently of say allianee with Powes engaged in hoatilities against China.

It will be obBerved that the United States is at peace with the Chinese empire, and that we have no motive for waging war against it, either single-handed or in alliance with England and Franoe," The accounts from Nicaragus received by the Arago at Southampton do not appear to be reLiable, those by the present mailtending to show that Walker was in great danger The New York Tribune gives credence to the following statement- "On Saturday wehad an interviewwitha gentleman wvho came as a pasenger in the steamer Texas, and from whom we obtained the latest inteligence from the seat of war in Nicaragua. Our informant is an intelligent native of Nicaragua, who owns a large hacienda near Rivas, He was among the fist to espouse Walker's cause, to which he remained true until he discovered that Walker, instead of being a Liberator, Was but a petty chief at the head of a banditti On the 18th of March our informant left Virgin Bayin the steamer San Carlos, and croesed the lake to Fort San Car]os, at the head of the San Juan River, which point was held by a strong force of Costa Ricas. At Fort San Carlos he was oine by a Costa Rican priest and a soldier, and there embarked in a canoe for Greytown. To pass Castillo they were compeUed to cary their canoe by the road around the rapids, to avoid the dauger of crossing the rapids. Castio they passed without difficulty, they being known to the Cosh Rican forces; and they floated to a point above Sarapiqu", which is held by the Fillibusters under Lockridge, about dusk Here they filled the canoe nearly full of water, to give it the appearence of a log of wood, and throwing themselves in the river on the side of the canoe opposite the fort, were enabled to float by undiscovered. They reached Greytown in time to takle passage in the Texas for Aspinwall, where the priest and soldier left for Costa Rica. Our informant had been in General Canas's camp, at Virgin Bay and St. George, several days previous to his departure on the 18th. At that time it was not known vthere Walker and his men were. A few days previously, finding themselves in a starving condition, bein cut off from obtaining snpplies by the scouting parties of the Costa Ricans, Walkler had evacuated Rivss, with the intention of forcing his way if possible to Rosanro-a point about seven miles from S;u Juan del Sur, where he hoped at least to find food for his men. This movement was observed by the Costa Rican scoixts, who fell back upon the main body of the allied forces. The allies at once marched to intercept Walker, who, hearing that they were advancing, made an ineffectual attempt to reach Rivas. In the meantime a guerilla party of Costa Ricans-10 of whom are constantly moving along the transit road to fire upon the small parties of WLker's men whho are sent out to obtain supplies, and to intercept the recrits from California-having discovered that Walker had left Rivas, entered the town, and, either by aecident or design, the remaining part of the city was se; on fire. The opinion of the allies at Virgin Bay when our informant left was that the Eillibusters were making a desperate struggle to reach the coast to provide for the safety of Walker, by sendinghim out of the country. A correspondence had taken place between Walker and General Canas, which- ct has been tortured into a foundation for the statement that Canas was ready to acknowledge Walker's rule. The facts of this correspondence our informant states to be that Walker had opened a correspondence with General Canas, in which the Ellhlbusters proposed to surrender, provided they would be permitted to leave the countr General Cnaus stated that he would ccept their surrender, and give passports to the whole force, with thewexception of Walker himself, whom he in. tended to deliver up to the authotities of Costa Rica. This offer Walker's adherents refutsed to accept, and their efforts to reach the coast are undonbtedly with the view of providing for the safety of their leader. Should he reach San Juan del Sur, he would probably leave the country in the little schooner which Captin Fasoux abandoned, unless General Bosquet should arrive with the force of 1,000 Costa Ricans, which our Panama correspondent stated was expected to reach that port on the 21st of March. The officers of the American vessel of war at San Juan del Sur interested themselves in favour of Walker and his men with General Canas, who replied that he would pay the expenses of the whole force to the United States, except walker himself, who must be delivered up. The reported battle and victory on the 16th our informant states to be entirely without foundation in trath." The Rome Se&ntin states that on the 2d the ferryboat between Cape Vincent and Kingston (Canada) was partially capsized by a rush of passengers to the bow, and out of 15 or 20 only two persons escaped. The rest were drowned. The Baltimwre.Republican gives an account of an extraordinary and fatal duel which occurred at Winston (Maryland). The parties were fasteneddown by their trousers to a two-inch oak plank, and fought with bowie-knives. "They fought," says the Republican, " until Drain was mortally wounded. Young Pendleton was cut nearly in pieces, and now :ies in a critical position. Part of Pendleton's knife is still in Drain's head. There is no hope of his recovery. The doctors think they will both die. Drain was 22, and Pendleton 19." On the 6th snow fell at Buffalo, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Nashville.

"Mr. Fowler is engaged in making inquiries respecting the relatives of John Parker, who also lest his life, and in reference to the rest of the boatmen, who shared the same danger and evinced the same intrepid spirit in the perfonrance of their duty, with a view to tendering them a beconiing acknowledgment on the part of Her Majesty's Government.

Tx LoCAL ARTISTS' EX IR=BmON AT MANtCHESTM. -The great exhibition of the works of local artists will be opened in the Peel-park Museum on Wednesday evening by a convmrsazione, at which a lrge and influential cam. pany is expected to assemble. The exhibition is inteaded to be for several months contemporaneously with that of tho Art Treasures. It was commenced in no spirit of rivalry, but at the suggestion of a gentleman oonneceed with the borough of Salford, who foresas the probable comple^ tion of a newwing of the P'eel-park MIuseum, defigned for a picture gallery, about this time, aff/rding an opportunity for an exhibition of the kind which might never recur. Theopaintings are limited tovworks by artists, living or deceased, wvholsave been born or have lived or followsed their profession in Manchester and its neighbourhood. The exhibition will come under the rules applicable to the museum and library of the Peel-park, and the dmissions wiul oonsoquently be free of charge. Visitors to the Art Treasures will thus have an opportunity of se.ing these works at the same time with the free library and museum without additional cost, and there is no doubt that it will be ain additional source of attraction to many thousands of people. There are between 300 and 400 oil and water-colour paint. ings collected, and among them are many works of consi. derable merit. Among the paintings by deceased artists are a capital picture, by Joseph Maiden, of " Alpine Mastiffs ;" two by Liversedge, including the scene on the rocks, from Sir Walter Scott's Atiuary; several by Old Parry, ilustrating scenes at Ecles Vakes, and other local feasts; one of the "Old Market-lane," in the Manchester of 1822, by Ralston; besides several pictures by Mather, Brown, and others. The best pictures, however, are by living artists, and include a family group (portraits of Alr Green and her two children, of Portsmouth, near Todmorden); the " Stranded 74 " the portrait of an old sailor who had been on board Nelson aship the Victory,andthe 'eOld Sailor," by Williani Percy. All these are painted with Rreat truthfulness and character. Some capital landscapes grou the mountain scenery of Wales, by Whaite, will also be regarded with interest; as also will a picture, representing boys blowing bubbles, by Mr. Watson, and Duval's picture, " The ProposL." There are also some goodpaintings by Linton, MIark Anthony (a churchyard in Kent), and Edward Boyle. The works of the latter include scenes on the river Hebden, in the Todmorden Valley, on Derwontwater, and Loch Achra, giving evidence of much carefal painting in the spirit "vhich Raskin has inculcated 'l so much force. Among other works deserving much attention and praise are pamtings by Bostock, Frank Stone, Crozier, Mitchell, Mr. WiLson Dyer, the hon. secretary, Mr. Iammeraley, the president (master of the School of De. signJ, and other artists. .I~ALL OF AN ARROLITE iN FRMAC.-An aerolite was seen f-slliiag on the afternoon of tho 6th inst. in ihe banlicue of Andolshem, near Colmar.

THE U.NITED STATk,'N. fIRom out OW2r OOR.RSO. AN -, NEW YORK, APRIL 7. The Chinese debates, the dissolntion, of ParliaVnent, and the first movements of the general -eleotion have all occurred at the exact time to insure them attention on this side of the Atlantic, {or home politics are at this momernt uneventful, .nd there is a blank to be fiUed up. The excitement ,of the contest for the Presidency is always followed ay a reaction; for ten or twelve nionths after-wrards the surface of politics i8 calm, whatever explosive element5 are gathering under it for "the next time." When there is nothing to discuss but the new appointments, and the degree of succs with which one .section of the Democracy ha. ousted the other, on the principle of "rotation," the importation of a little excitemneut from Europe is very welcomue. if it cannot bo a revolution somewhere, or the outburat of a clvil war, an English general election is better than nothing. Besides, it is a process that can be followed with considerable interest at a distance; the chief party leaders are all known, and as our system ,compels them to face both opponents and constituencies in person, and fight themselves through with voice and pen, their indivi suality comes out with striking distinctness, and concen trtes attention, at aUl eveuts, if it does not I insure approval. They may he combined in the same movement, but they all work for it and' themselvesj in a different way. Disraeli, addressing hin Buckinghamshire constituents, cdnnot possibly be confounded with Cobden reasoning with or writing to the West Riding. Here all this individuality is lost in an ordinary political contest. Repiresen-tatives and constituents nLever meet face to face; no personal addresses are written; no speeebes made; those who manage the " primary elections" put down the names of those who shall be candidates, I and the " free and independent" only go to the poll with the party ticket ready printed for them, and -confirm the decision of the almost unknown power that dictates it. Any votes given for names out-side the " party ticke"f would be merely thrown away. The consequence is that to -almost any given constituent, his representative is! a myth, an abstraction; he has never seen him,| -may never havo heard his name,-may never even have read it on the " ticket" he voted, which hei may take on trust, aB it is made " al right" before it reaehes his hands. It would be a very safe wvager i to mal.e, that of any 100 citizens of New York, -taken at random, not 10 could tell you, if asked, I the names of the representatives of the State in l Congress, aud not five the names of the members for i -the city in the Legislature of the State, unless you happened to alight upon a member of one i ,of the central committees, conventions, or other bodies who manage the whole affair. These are the real electors who must be gained. The mass of the -onstituency in such a city as New York, for instance, have as much free choice as those speculators who are blandly requested to " select" a few cards from a conjuror's pack; they can only draw those the operator presents to them. The last election -here for members of the Legistlature, City and State officers of all kinds, was hold on the same day which decided the election of the President. It was a grand sweep of namies into place and I office, yet of the whole immense number of candidates none appeared in person, not one addressed the electors, or gave a pledge or promise, or avowed a principle or a specified line of action. They all subscribed to the party creed or "platform" ,of the titne, and passed unquestioned. Who they are exactly the great bulk of the people they represent do not know to this day, and will scarcely hiave found out till they are called on to elect a new batch in the same manner. The advantages of the -system are its extreme rapidity and the promptness with which it insures a decision, if it is not generally the best, or even a good one ; and these,where the terms of office are short, thc changes frequent, and all pests, offices, and trusts elective, are considerable. iBut it destroya individuality, and levels the dis1inctions of talents, education, and integrity. Gifts, virtues, anid acquirements are of secondary importance in the rush; they cannot be sifted out, and have not time enough to display themselves. The impersonal character of the elective system of America is one of the most amazing peculiarities of the country. There 'is a growing inpression that the form the system has taken produces many evils, and there is a faint indication of a desire to supersede the" primlary elections" (which are reaUy unknown to and unrecognized by the law, being only a ma-chinery which has been gradualy created) by some other process. But how representatives and constituencies are to become known to each other and have that direct personal communication which gives the relation life and interest is still an unsolved problem. The case is, of course, modiaed in the rural districts. It is in the great cities that cliques which manage the " primary" nominations,-which are, in fact, the real elections,-have the greatest power. It is remarkable that the Southern States have preserved more of the Saxon usage with Tegard to elections than the States of the North. The constituiencies, of course whites exclusively, are smaller, and the candidates can and do appeal directly to them, and the changes are less frequent. When the South have sent a firm or able par'isan to Congress they keep him there for years togetber by re-election, and the compactness of party thus gained, and the experience and tact inevitably acquired, give its representatives a de<cided advantage over the ever-changing succes.sions of new men from the North. How this has told the North begins to perceive now that it is "realizin' " how completely the South governs and commands in the Federation. The political moveiaents of the North can only be studied, as they are effected, in the mass; mere personal opinion and talents outside the ranks of either of the great parties go for very little; if a man cannot go with is party he must sink into private life; as a politician he is useless, or worse. Thus, many of our proniiiient names could not by mere personal abilities keep themselves in the front of the battle; the moment a man separates from the main body of his party he disappears; his " availability" is gone, unless the other party has grown strong enough, and he joins that. But a thoroughly " independent member," voting on his own views of things, and hitting at all parties in turn according to their demerits, would be such a puzzling phenomenon in Congress that both sides would agree to suppress him as a mere disturbance. The " conventions" throughout the country would exclude him from the " ticket" when his term expired, and he would be extin^guished. An American politician is exgpected to be a soldier, not a critic, and, if he will not keep step with the column and fire straight at the enemy, he is disarmed as danigerous and sent to the rear. The position of America in the Chinese quarrel and tho bhare the national force on the coast has so far taken in it have been under the consideration of the Government. But it is not known that any positive decision has been arrived at. The probbility is that the Administration will avoid any -direct alliance with the European Powers involved in the hostilities, though what the American officers on the spo,t may have done in self-defence and ia protection of their flag will no doubt be approved. iS is possible, also, that a new American ^Commis- I sioner or Minister may be sent out with more spt-ci6c instructions than those on which the present representative of the Governmeut in China has acted. Bevond this there is no indication that the Administration will proceed. 'The relations of America with China are simply commercial ; they have no military character to lose in the East that would affect the stability of an empire, and do not feel called on to go to war to maintain ours. Moreover, if the European Powers compel the Chiinese to make a new treaty or observe the old one, the Americans will in either case reap the advantage of the conditions in favour of general commercial intercourse. So, if the Celestials will, -continue to discriminate between four stripes on a liag and 13, and not behead any Americans they may cateh for the identity of language, matters be-tween Yeh and the American authorities may remain for a time as they stand; but aay outrage on American life or property may change the aspect of affairs, and a new Miiister Extraordinary may find he requires the snpport of more American guns. In short, evenbt may compel actual co operation; but the Government at present hesitates to enter into a formal alliance with Europe for Chinese hostilities. ConBess does not meet till December next, and the It5ecutive alone cannot declare war, and will sot take the reaponsibility of any policy which would be equivalent to such a declaration. But there is no doubt the Anericans on the spot fully share the European feeling, and, unless forbidden by positive instructions, will do their part mn any emergency; perfect neutrality will be all but impoasible. There has beeni the usual amount of discussion about the " new appointments" yet remaining to be made at Washinigton; but they have little or no interest beyond the States concerned. The new charter for the city of New York and the new Police Bill have passed in the State House of Representatives at Albany. The Republican majority have carried them through, and if they we not spoiled by amendments, which seems likely, in the Senate, they may be real improvements in the administration of the city, which at present is a mass of confusion, one department thwarting another. While the most necessary work is left undone the city revenues disappear, no one can tell how; the first thing the public hears of it3 money is, that it is gone ; to do it justice, it receives the information with great quietude of mind; it is busy making niore. The apathy is so complete, though the city taxes have run up to seven millions annually, that some of the journals which seem to do all the indignation, are driven to despair and a savage pessimism; they hope things will grow worse than they wre, that the next batch of corporation officers will be greater scoundrels (the epithets are not mine, but native) tban the present, that they will rob more and do less, if leas be possible, till the taxes are 20,000,000 instead of 7,000,000, when, perhaps, the " respectables," who pay, will wake up, take the trouble now and then to vote, and exercise a little control over their own money. Till they do this, there is little faith to be placed in new charters and new distributions of functions and powers. Thebusy, fast, living, speculatingcommunity of NewYork, the great commercial class, all the wealthy of the middle and upper grades, appear to regardself-governmentmuch as the Turks do dancina-as a troublesome and degrading kind of activity, that no man with any respect for himself can join in. The business of city government, therefore, faUs into the hands of professionals, who devote themselves to it with great zeal; according to an official report of the Mayor, they come into oflice poor, and after a term or two leave it rich. How it is done is never clearly traced, though there are strong suspicions, and the papers now and then drag a case to light as an illustration. But, as before said, it is useless; the public is unmoved, and thin.gR go on as before. The present dearth of events may be imagined, when it is stated that the great subject of discussion for the last ten days has been mud-literally nothing but mud ! The topic is closely connected with the above paragraph, and is the last striking illustration of the "system." By some mysterious hitch in the city machinery, the streets have not been cleaned since last June; half a million of dollars have been voted and paid, it appears, for the work; the mud visibly remains, the money is gone. The heavy snow of winter became slush with the thaw, thickened into mud, and lastly dried into dust, but in each State it was undisturbed. The time came for new contracts for the work, and many of the wards were taken by somebody who proposed to use sweeping machines-an unpopular innovation. The first night the reformer began operations, the " all-pay-and-no-work party" got up a riot, drove off his men, breaking the brooms and shovels on their heads, by the instigation, it is said, of the underbidden contractors. The next day and night the police were sent to keep the peace, and the mud was carted off, under a guard; but as soon as the pavement is got down to and the machines can begin to work they are threatened with demolition. The Irishmen who were employed also struck, on outside persuasion. The contractor supplied their place with destitute foreigners-Frenchmen, and all the Italian organ-grinders who could be hunted up. The last seemed delighted with the novelty of definite wages, and quite distinguished themselves. The proprietors of carts refused to let them on hire; others have been brought in from the country; and the battle is still proceeding. The new contractor is supported by the press and the astonished public, which can scarcely yet believe that any work to be paid for is actually being done. But the new contracts are not yet confirmed by the Council, and if any legal chicanery can upset them and suppress the dangerous innovations of sweeping machines (which have no votes) and a working contractor, it will be tried. Reports have arrived of a great victory gained by Walker over the Costa Rican troops in an attack by the latter on Rivas. The account is very similar in its details to the affair of Granada and Maraza, which was also announced as a brilliant victory, though it was the great disaster of Walker's career. How the present action could have been gained by a force weakened nearly one-half by recent desertion is difficult to understand. It may resolve itself into a desperate sortie from Rivas and an attempt to reach the Pacific coast, but no details can be known til the arrival of the next steamer.
MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. The steam-yacht about to be presented to the Emperor of Japan was this morning undocked at Woolwich and taken into basin, preliminary to her removal to Devonport to be paid down and despatched to her destination. The yacht is most compactly fitted throughout in the style of comfort which usually pervades yacht arrangements in the present day. Her Majesty's newly constructed steam screw corvette Scout, in the basin at Woolwioh, having received her masts, is ordered to be forwarded to Sheerness on Wednesday next to be fitted aud laid up in the second class of steam reserve. The cadets of the Royal Military College at Wolvwich have been ordered to commence the usual summer course of carbine drills. A party of about 160 of these young officers was marched to Plumstead-common this morning, and put through the necessary instruction by non-commisdoned offlcers of the Artillery. Captain W. F.

PEBUOU5 ADVzNTURn A'r NIAGARA FAri&-A correspondent of the ltochester Uniow writes from Niagara Falls, uade! date of March 31, as follows:-llr. Thomas J. Taylor, of West Greenfield, Herkimer county, New York, wrho had been to Illinois and was on his way home, stopped at this place to wait for a friend whom he expecte.l, asd vhlie here he went down the steps at Whitmer's mills, adjoining the bridge, to view the river, and while there aat upon a large rook and took out his wallet to exaumne his papers and umoney, and after a short time he became dizzy and fell into the river. He states that for the first 10 rods he wasunder the water, aud was thrownagainastlrge rockswhich 'Wereuader the bridge. When he pa-sed the bridge a gentleman saw him and gave the alarm. He wout down the rapids about 200 rods, whtan he was drawn by the current towards and upouthe roeks,to whichhe clungand gottromuthewater. Our village was aroused in a nioment as it were, and the rope ladaers belongmg to the Bridge Comp any were brought out and on the spot at onc,, and let over the bank some 260 feet, when Millard B. Coburn went down and got the ladder over the lower ledge; tben ra Gerii,an, name unknown, went down to Taylor, who was almost exhausted with cold. After about half-.n-hour Taylor commenced to ascend the ladder. He wax seuie time in getting up. He is a man of about 60 ya s a of age. He was greeted upon his arriyal on the bank by a geiexal shoxut of welcomie, and was taken to the IA Deu H,.uso, where, by the kindness of the worthy bost, John N- La Deu, he was provided with a change of clothing. He is now smart and well, but says it was rather a hard road ta travel, and would rather be excused from a second trip.

Ta 1JNITED STATES STFAM FRIGATE NIAGA"AIn consequence of the storm yesterday the sails of the NTiagara were not bent, and she will therefore not depart on her trial trip to-day. She may get off on Wednedy, but It IS more probable that she will be detained until Thursday. She went into commisdion yesterday, and all was buste and excitement on board; The men were sbipped, the work of cleaning up commenced, and in a day or two she will be a model of neatness, as she already is a model of beauty. As she will leave us so soon, it may be wel to refresh the memories of our readers with a brief outline of her. The hull is of live oak, varying in width and thickness from 22 inches by 14 near the keel to 11 by 8 on deck. The keel is 320 feet long ; length on deck, 345 feet; breadth of beam over all, 55 feet; depth of hold, 31 feet 6 inches. Four boilers and three horizontal engines of 1,000-horse power, built by Pease and Murphy, constitute her propellimg power. The c linders are 72 inches in diameter and 8-feet stroke. Al of this machinery, leigh. ing over 500 tons, is applied to turn a single propeller of 18 feet diameter. To protect the machinery from shot in action it is all enolosed by immense iron coal-bunkers, over-arching and descending many feet below the water-line. Her chimneys are telescopic, and while sbe is under sail or in battle. may be lowered almost out of sight. The engine and fire rooms are perfect in their way, and being well supplied with ample ventilators, will probabiy be as cool and comfortable as can be desired. The Niagr will rely for speed mainly upon her sailing abilities, and although the fires will always be kept bedded, and everything in readiness for getting up steam at short notice whenever required, she will, unless in calms and on extraordinary occasions, be only a clipper frigate. Her model is that of a mammoth olipper, with shallow forefoot, sharp, high bow, and hollow water lines. View her as 'we will, not a single straight line Is presented. Everywhere she curves fluent and free, challenging the admiration of the most critical by her vast yet perfectly symmetrical proportions. She sits on the sea " like a tbing of life," and when careering before a twelve-knot breeze one would feel on her as though he were astride a fleet, high-mettled courser, bounding along on the wings of the wind. When under full sail she will spread about 14,000 running yards or 7,000 square yards of canvass, and it is anticipated that her speed under canvass will be 15 or 16 knots, ana under steam 11 or 12 knots an hour. Her mainmast is 84 feet above deck, 111 feet in extreme height, 37. inches in diameter ; foremast, 74 feet above deck, 101 feet in extreme height, and 35 inobes in diameter; mizenmast, 85 feet in height, and 30 inches in diameter. Her mainyard is 106 feet in length, and her foreyard 94 feet. Her armament will consist of 12 great guns of U inches bore, 12 feet in length, and capable of throwing shot of 170 pounds and shells of 130 pounds weight. These guns were all cast at the West Point Foundry, but will not be put on board until after she has finished her peaceful task of laying the great submarine cable. One great feature in this vessel is her high and airy decks. Between the bottom or orlop and berth decks the height is 6 feet 6 inches; between the lower and main decks, 6 feet 8 inches; between the main and spar decks, 7 feet 3 inches. The main deck-, on which the officers and most of the men live, is admirably lighted by a multitude of dead-lights, and thoroughly ventilated. Captain Hudson's cabin is large and commodious, audneatly furnished. The most interesting object in it is a good likeness of the great matine architect, George Steers, painted in oil, life size, and framed in carved rosewood. This was painted for and presented by the workmen employed by Mr. Steers to the frigate, and 'wlll always have honourable place in the captain's cabin. State rooms have been fitted up in this room for the occupation of Professor Morse and Peter Cooper during the time the Niagara is engaged in laying the cable. The working force of the Niagara is 530 men, but on this trip she will have only 490. In addition to the above she will have one boatswain's mate, one gunner's ditto, one carpenter's ditto, one yeoman, one master-atarms, one ship's cook, five quartermasters, two quarter gunners, four captains of the forecastle, six captains of the tops, two captains of the afterguard, seven coxswains, one ship's steward, two officers' ditto, one sargeon's steward, one sailmaker's mate, two captains of the hold, two officers' cooks, two ship's corporals, 100 seamen, 100 ordinary ditto, and 100 landsmen. Of the marines there are 4 sergeants, 3 corporals, 2 musicians, and 50 privates, In the engineer's department 46 firemen and coal passers are employed. Some idea of the capacity of such a floati7ig town may be anrived at when we state that she can carMr in addition to her guns, ammunition, coal, spare spars and sails, enough of provisions, clothing, medicine, grg, and nearly every other necessary required by all on board for a three years' ornise. Undoubtedly the Niagara is the finest, fastest, and largest vessel in the United States navy, and wherever she goes will reflect credit upon the genius and mechanical skill of the country.-New York Times. LolNDON SOCIr FOP. TRYE PROTECrION OF YOUNG FENIALFS.-This society has been established nearly 20 years, and its objects are to suppress improper houses and to save rounl females under 15 years of agefromthreatened ruin. rhe friends of the society held their anniversary dinner yesterday at tho London Tavern, Bishopsgatestreet, which was presided over by Mr. Sheriff Mechi, and was attended by a large number of the supporters of the institution. After partakiog of a dinner provided in the mual excellent style of the eotablishment, and after the customary loyal toast had been drunk, the chairman proposed "Prosperity to the society." He observed that the general result of the efforts of the institution had been to resce nmany yonng women from a course of vice and infamy, and to rearthem uptobecome virtuoua vivesand mothers. Many inmates of the asylumbad gone forth into tbe world thoroughly reformed,well trained for all domestic duties, and educated in a manner calculated to enable them to understand their moral obligations to society. Mr. Talbot, the honorary secretary, read the report of the proceedings of the society, by whiMh it appeared that 59 young females under 15 years of age were at the present time fed, clothed, and educated, and fitted for respectable servitude, in the Asylum at Tottetham; but he lamented to say that numerous applications were continually being made which, for want of funds, the society were obliged to reject. At a subsequent period of the evening the secretary announced the subscriptions to, amnount to upwards of 1,1001. The evening's proceedings were enlivened hy a selection of vocal mDusic, under the direction of Mfr. Turner, assted by Mr. Holmus, MSr. Shou-- bridge, and Mr Smytbson; and Mr. Elarker e^iI~ d ~s toastmaster.
I 1BEADIN6IROOM and' TIBBRPJES of thp BRITISH MUSBUA± The neow Reading-room of our National M =eum and Library is now substantially completed. We announced on Thursday last that it would be openod to public view onl the 8th of May for a week only and that on the following week readers will be admitted to its use under the usual regulations of the trustees. In the meanwhile our readers will be interested by an account of one of the most remarkable public buildingS and arehitectural 'wonders of modern times. 1lTe Y'imes, in a leading article on the 7th of May last year, contained a general description of the building then in progress; and we humbly conceive that, by our then protest against any fale economy or mfiserable stint of means for embellishment, we contributed to the perfection of its interior decoration. With the exception of a brief article in the Builder, of te 24th of March, 1855, w/hen the foundations were just laid accompanied by woodcut plans of the intended area and interior, we are not aware of Iay public notice of this marvellous work. Its site, in the internal quadrangle of the Museum, has concealed its progress from the public eye, although the lofty and capacious edifice occupies an area of 48,000 superficial feet. This site was indeed its proper and only situation from the obvious necessity of the new Reading-room being adjacent to the vast magazines of books and manuscripts contained in the various apartments of the Museum. In the publie view, therefore, the magnificent structure when visited will appear to have been created by the wand of a magician. Except to a few favoured visitors it is unknown and has been unseen. The present number of volumes in our great public library is upwards of half a million; but even that large figure does not comprise the far larger collection of separate and distinct articles-in traets, pamphlets, and manuseripts. They are legion, and not yet accurately catalogued or computed. Probably, the enormous quantity of pamphlets, political, theological, and scientific of Great Britain, since the Reformation, constitute the British Museum Library the largest collection of printed literature in the world. Maps also form a relatively considerable portion. The rate of increase is enormous. In the ParHamentary return for the year ending the 24th of December, 1856, not yet published, it will appear that the last annual additions number 10,434 volumes, including music, maps, and newspapers, of which 753 were presented, 4,018 purchased, and 5,831 acquired by home copyright. The number of distinct articles in these volumes was 27,616. In addition, the Library had accumulated numerous maps, charts, and plans, variously obtained. The number of pieces of music alone added was 2,347. In groms, the total additional articles that year numbered 42,639. Of the complete works accumulated in the 12 months 1,908 were presented, 2,005 purchased, and 7,933 were acquired under the Copyright Ats. In the same year, also, each article being stamped, the number of stamps used was 162,940 ! The number of books returned to the shelves of the General Library was 110,873; to those of the Royal Library, 8,869; to those of the Grenville Library, 1,018; to the closets in which books are kept from day to day for the use of the readers, 79 598- making a total of 200,358, or 604 per diem. Aading' the number of volumes returned to the shelves of the Reading-rooms, about 144,000, the whole amounts to 344,358, or 1,175 per diem. The number of readers within that year was 53,209, or anaverage of 181 per diem, the Reading-rooms having been kept open 293 days. Each reader had, therefore, consulted on an average 64 volumes per diem. Thus had our giant Library outgrown its local habitation since its foundation in 1753, and when the first contents of "Montagu House," Bloomsbury, consisted of the Sloane Collection, including only a few books, the Harleian MSS., and the Cottonian Library; Parliament providing no money, butby act authorizing the provision of 30,0001. by a lLottery The old mansion continued perfectly sufficient for the whole miscellaneous contents of the Museum until a few new rooms were added for the Egyptian antiquities obtained in 1801, and for the Townle3' Marbles. In 1823 the present eatirely new building, designed by Sir Robert Smirke, became necessary. Montagu House was finally levelled with the ground in 1845, the new portico being only finished April 19, 1847. It is worthy of record that in the month of July, 1759, only five readers attended the public reading-room. The utter insufficiency of the institution for book room and accommodation for readers existed during the last four Parliaments, and without a remedy. The public, the trustees, men of letters in the Legislature, in vain devised various plans, and demanded pecuniary aid from the Commons. Select cominittee reports and annual returns followed' in rapid and abortive succession. The blue-books and other Parliamentary papers and privately printed statements would almost fill a private library. It is sufficient now to refer our readers to the two volumes of reports in 1835 and 1836, and to the various Parliamentary returns asked for since 1850; to similar Parliamentary volumes on Public Libraries in 1849 and 1850; and, lastly, to the effective Report of the Royal Commission (with 800 appended folio pages of evidence) appointed in 1850 to inquire into the constitution and goverent of the Museum. The practical result was an unanimous representation of the Commissioners that " the subject of additions to the Museum was one which must evidently, at no distant period, engage the attention of Her Majesty's Government., Mr. Hume, fortunately, was an active member of the Commission, and concurred from honest conviction in the necessity of an early and munificent grant of public money. The Royal Commissioners, reporting the inadequacy of bookroom, the injury to the valuable contents of the library by the existing reading-room arrangements, the slave-labour of the attendants, and the bad accommodation of the readers, stated that " these circumstances have suggested to Mr. Panizzi a scheme of extension by which the buildings to be constructed would consist of new MSS. rooms and a new enlarged reading-room, which would enable the trustees to devote the present MSS. rooms, including that at present made over to the Grenville Library, to the printed books. This report lay dormant almost for four year. " Questions" were constantly asked in the House of Commons as to the intentions of the Ministers of the day. The answers were of the usual circumlocutive character. The ordinary annual vote was now and then opposed by individual members, on the ground of the indecision or indifference of the Government to the recommendations of the Commission. Actually the trustees one year declined to take more than half of the sum proposed to be voted for the purchase of hooks and other objects of acquisition, assigaing as a true reason that the Museum would be inadequate for the reception of increased contents. Matters thus continued in statu quo. In the meantime the difliculty of finding room for the current accessions to the Library became daily greater. The plan first suggested by Mr. Panizzi, and alluded to by the Commissioners, had to be abandoned on the ground of expense and delay. As a last resort, Mr. Panizzi prop5osed to the trustees that a building should be erected in the inner quadrangle of the Museum. By this scheme the cost of purchase would be avoided. This proposal was accompanied by drawings, showing the ground plan, and a general detail of the manner in which it was proposed that the interior arrangements for the accommodation of the readers and of books should be framed. The architect of the trustees, Mr. Sydney Smirke, was directed to confer with Mr. Panizzi on the details of this plan, and reported favourably upon it. It is a remarkable circumstance that, although some modifications were made by Mr. Panizzi in his original plan, they were ultimately abandoned, and the scheme, as he first conceived it, carried out. Mr. Smirke has the great merit that, laying aside all professional jealousy, he has always shown himself ready to carry out the plan of the original designer; and the result is a building, than which none are better, fe w perhaps so thoroughly, adapted to the purposes for which it is intended. Ultimiately, on a "Supply night," on the 3d of July 1854, Parliament, by its last evening vote, on the " miscellaneous estimates," granted 55,2251. for the " British Museum estabishment," towards its ordinaryexpenditure, and 1011421. for "new buildings and fittings." In this latter gross eatimate there was an item of 61,0001. "for the erection of a building within the interir quadrangle for the purpose of affording inqrezbed accoimmoda- tion." One mnember only ".ought thh mm a, rt sal o much." SAk'i&No*he r ft' tlye great naional monument we are now The fiit grant WAs not hlf enough,a *i;fl soz seen -StIl it wma A bcghninig,, and bed- t~.e founAation. Within three yemte t t t haa been completed, at the cost of l50,oOl, o about that sum when allthe "extra" area unted for. The building is circular. It does not oecupy the' e-ktire quadrangle, there being unavoidably b cleu intt.rval of from 27 to 50 feet all round, to give light and a ir to the surrounding buildings, and as a guard ag,aint possible destruction by fire frorm the outer zarts Of ,'he Museum. The dome is 140 feet in diameter, -ts height being 100 feet. In this dimendon of diam eter it is only inferior to the Pantheon of Romeby 2 feet; St. Peter's being only 139; St. aria in Fiore.ce, 139; the tomb of Mahomet, Bejapore, 13o; at. Paul's 112; St. Sophia Constantinople, 107, a'nd the Church atDarmstadt, 105. In other particuar our new dome is far superior. The new Reading-roo.n oontaius 1,250,000 cubic feet of space; its " auburbe`" or surrounding libraries, 7P0,000. The building ';t constructed principally of iron, with brick arches be tween the main ribs, supported by 20 iron piers, ha,7ing a setional area of 10 superficial feet to each in,'luding the brick casing, or 200 feet in all. Thi's s&Wurg of space by the use of iron is remarkable the piers of support on which our dome rests only thus otwpying. 200 feeo wbereas the piers of the Pant.5on of Rome fill 7,477 feet of area and those of the *¶-amb of Mahomet 5,593. Upwards of 2,000 tons of iron41lhvo beex used in the construction. The weight of t1he materials uaed in the dome is about 4,200 tcs-viz., nupwards of 200 tons on each pier. The StV standard was only fixed in January,1855. The frsmnework and scaffolding upon which the dome restad were zemoved on the 2d of the following June. No sb. sidence or " set" of material was observaE1e-on the wedges being removed. The entire dome was roofed in and copper covering laid in September, 1855. The roof is formed into two separate spherialand concentric air chambers, extending over the whole surface; one between the external ooveringand brick vaulting, the object being the equalization of temperature during extremes of heat and cold out of doors; the other chamber, between the brick vaulting and the internal visibie surface, being, intended to carry off the vitiated air from the Reading-room. This ventilation is effected through apertures inthe sffites of the windows, and partly by others at the top of the dome; the bad air paing through outlets provided around the lantern. iE order to obviate the effects of condensation, al] the skylights, lanterns, and windows throughout the building are double. The quantity of glass used amounts to about 60,000 superficial feet. In order to guard against the consequences of an avalanche of snow falling from the dome on tothesurroundinrg libraries, the building has been carried up outside perpendicular to such a height above the spring of the arch as to form a gallery nine feet in width, provided with proper outlets by which the snow is intercented. this vast Dome contains ample and comfortable accommodation for 300 readers. Each person will have a separate table, 4 feet 3 inches long. He is screened from the opposite occupant by a longitudinal division, which ia fitted with a hinged desk graduated on sloping racks, and a folding shelf for spare books. In the space between the two, which is recessed, an inkstand is fixed, having suitable penholders. Thus the whole table top is free from writing implements or other embarrassments? and every precaution is taken to preserve the books If the readers will but use common care. The framework of each table is of iron, forming air-distributing channels, which are contrived so that the air may be delivered at the top of the longitudinal screen division, above the level of the heads of the readers, or, if desired, only at each end pedestal of the tables, all the outlets being under the control of valves. A tabular footrail also passes from end to end of each table, v hich may have a current of warm water passed through it at pleasure, and be used as a footwarmer if the reader have a slowcirculation, or perchance there comes a Moscow winter. The Catalogue tables, with shelves under, and airdistributing tubes between, are ranged in two concentric circles around the central superintendent's enclosure or rostrum, the latter being fitted with tables, tieket-boxes, and with dwarf partitions sarmounted by glass screens, dividing a passageleading to the surrounding libraries. The pedestals of the tables form tubes communicating with the air chamber below, which is six feet high and occupies the whole area of the Reading-room. It is fitted with hot-water pipes, arranged in radiating lines. The supply of fresh air is obtained from a shaft 60 feet high, built on the north side of the north wing about 300 feet distsnt, communicatine with a tunnel or sub-way, which has branches or "loop lines" fitted with valves for diverting the current either wholly through the heating apparatus, or through the cold-sir flues, or partly through either, as occasion may require. The air channels are of sufficient capacity to admit a supply of fresh air for 500 persons at the rate of 10 cubic feet per minute, and at a velocity not exceeding 10 foot per second. For summer ventilation steam pipes, placed at the summit of the roofs and dome, will be heated, and extract the foul air when the external and internal temperature is unfavourable for the purpose. The new Libraries now deserve description. Their arrangement is equallyremarkable and original astheother parts of this immense and ingeniousstructure. It is calculated that the inner library shelves in galleries within the Dome-room will contain 80,000 volumes. Two lifts are placed at convenient stations for the purpose of raising the books to the level of the several gallery floors. The bookcases are of novel and simple construction, the uprights or standards being formed of malleable iron galvanized and framed together, having hard wood inserted between the iron to receive tbe brass pins upon which the shelves rest. The framework of the bookcases forms the support for the iron perforated floors of the gallery avenues, and which are generally eight feet wide, the central six feet, being appropriated to the perforated floor, and the remainder being a clear space between the back of the books and the filooring, and by which contrivance the light from the skylights (in all cases extending to the full width of the avenues) is thrown down the back of the books on each story, so that the lettering of the backs may be easily discerned throughout the book ranges. The shelves are formed of iron galvanized plates, edged with wainscot and covered with russet hide leather, and having a book-fal attached. They are fitted at each end with galvanized iron leather covered, and wadded pads placed next the skeleton bookcase framing, to prevent injury to the binding when the books are taken out or replaced. Between these pads the skeleton framing of the cases forms an aperture, by which a current of air may pass and ventilation be kept up throughout. The shelves rest upon brass pins, the holes for which are pierced at three-quarters of an inch apart from centre to centre; but by a contrivauce in cranking the shaft of the pin, -which may be turned upwards or downwards, this interval is practicaUy halved and the position of the shelves may be altered threeeighths of an inch at a time. There are 2,7 50,000 of theseholes! In al cases, except against the external walls, the bookeases are double, the books beiog placed back to back, alatticeof iron work being fixed for their longitudinal separation. Thus, throughout the whole. i'iterior of the new building there are no wals, the division being in all cases formed of a double range of books, back to back. The only exception is at the shelving provided for newspapers, a single range of which necessarily occupies the space of two ranges of books. Three thousand superficial feet of cases are provided for newspapers. For convenience of access to the galleries the staircases have been placed so that, throughout the bnilding, they are within 40 feet of each other. The building contains three miles lineal of bookcases, and which in all the cases are eight feet high; asiuming them all to be spaced for the averaged octavo book size, the entire r.Aages form 25 railes of shelves. Assuming the shelves to be filled with books, of paper of average thiokness, the leaves placed edge to edge would exrnd about 25,000 miles, or more than three times the diameter of the globe ! The cost, about 150,0001., includes the fittings and furniture aud the necessary shelves for the worlking of the existing library establishment. The decoration of tne interior domue is happily an exception to the 'monotonous and dingy shadows usually adopted in this country. Light colotrm and the purest gUding have been preferred.

FOQEBIGN I.TBLLIGENCB. FRANCE. (nOM OUB OWN oOBMESPOlfDT.) [no following appuoid in our seoond edilon of yes. beidAy :-I PARIS, Ara 19, 6 P.M. I am happy to state that the serious Werence between Mexico and Spain presents, at tlhe moment I write, a fair chance of a pacific arraugement. It is not often one can approve the foreign or domestic policy of the Spanish Government, but on the present occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Marquis Pidal, has evinced much moderation and good sense. He has been zealously seconded by Marshal Serrano, who has also had the assistance of the English Ambassador in Paris, and the prench Minister for Foreign Affairs, Count Walewski. As I mentioned in my letter of Friday, Mlarshal Serrano had on that day a long interview with Al. Lafragua, the new Envoy of Mexico to the Court of Queen Isabella, but whose departure from Paris has been delayed, the Spanish Government having required satisfaction for the assassination of its subjects as an indispensable condition to his reception. Genoral Serrano had previously several conversations vith M. Lafragua, but until he received further instructions from Yiadrid he did not feel justified in m-aking or accepting any formal proposition. In the interview yesterday General Serrano repeated, in a more positive manner, the assurance that his Governmnent were Mtil animated by a sincere and earnest desire to bring this unpleasant affair to a pacific conclusion. What they asked from Mexico was nothing unreasonable-nothing but what moderate and impartial men would require. They do not insist upon the Mexican Government attempting impossibilities. They ask for the arrest and punishment of such of the assassins as can be laid hold of. If, as may be alleged, some of these criminals have succeeded in making their escape, and taken refuge in parts of the territOry which are inaccessible to the officers of the Government, they wilM make every allowance for the difficulty of capture or pursuit, and they only require an assurance that some reasonable satisfaction shall be granted previous to the Envoy being received as the official representative of the Mexican Government. The French and English Goverrments are most anxious that the difference should be arranged without an appeal to arms, and they consider that the Mexican Government cannot well refuse such moderate terms. M. Lafragua, who appears to be of a conciliatory disposition, and to whom very probably some latitude has been left, wished that an assurance that the Spanish Government was really desirous of an arrangement, and would receive his explanations should be given him. I believe Marshal Serrano frankly answered that he should do so if a request to that effect were made by the Mexican Envoy. The demand has probably been made this day in writing, and I have little doubt that it will be at once responded to. Indeed, the affair has taken so favourable a turn that I should not be surprised if the Mexican Envoy set out for Madrid in the course of this week. Marshal Serrano leaves on Saturday to take his seat in the Senate, and with but slight chance of his return. The reasons I explained some time since, but no formal resignatien has been as yet tendered. I believe that there are parties who for purposes of their own are most desirous of aggravating the diapute between Spain and Mexico, and preventing a pacific solution. Those parties may probably tue their best effbrts to fan the flame rather than extinguish it; but M. Lafragua, who is an intelligent as weU as a moderate man, will, it is hoped, resist any evil influence that may be practised on him. The English Government would not, I believe, assume any prominent attitude in this affair, and I am not sure whether even the capture of Cuba by American bucaniers would be a sufficient motive for any change of policy that would involve it in a quarrel with the United States. It ib, however, as much the interest of Mexico as of Spain not to involve themselves in war. They are watched by a powerful enemy, who is ready to take advantage of the weakness of either, and that weakness is his opportunity. The news from Spain itself is anything but encouraging so far as the chances of a temperate, firm, and equitable system of government are concerned. We have the same intrigues of parties against each other, those w ho are out of power sparing nothing to get in, and those that are in well disposed, but afraid, to have recourse to any act of violence to remain in. Whatever the organs of General Narvaez may say to the contrary, he has tried several times to eflect a modification in his Cabinet, and each time he has failed. As it is, he is not sure of his position for a week-I might say, not for a day. The quarter which he still has most reason to fear is the highest of all. Her Majesty never liked him, and at the present time he is less an object of affection than ever, and Narvaez fears lest some ostensible mark of Royal friendship should be offered him, for he knows it would be the immediate forerunner of his fall. Her Majest largely inhelits the disposition of her father Ferdinand, and, independently of any feeling towards her present adviser, she appears never more true to nature than when sapping the ground from under a new Minister. The (Queen has certainly no reason to look with favour on that most detested of all bands that ever disgraced aild endangered a country,the Polacos, and the recollection of the dangers to which she was exposed by them ought to inspire her with horror; yet so strong is the hereditary instinct that even theqi receive a certain amount of encouragement at the Palace, and it would not at all surprise me if afterthefallof theNarvaezCabinet, theBravo Murilo fraction ascended to power, and then made way for Sartorius and Co. It is the same story over and over again; the same cycle in which the same revolutions begin and end, and the same actors appear and disappear. How fond of this childish sport of thwarting her Ministers Royalty is may be judged from the following anecdote, which now runs the round of political circles in Madrid. An officer named Zapatero is the present Captain-General of Catalonia. He was for years the proMg6 and friend of General O'Donnell, and indeed it is to that impetuous and inconsistent person that he owes the rapid promotions which, without any extraordinary meritof his own,he has received In the Spanish army. Whatever any one else owes to O'Donnell, Zapatero owes him a deep debt of gratitude for favours and protection cxtending over years. A friend of O'Donnell's-Geueral Dulce, who first won reputation when a simple balberdier by the defence of the _rand staircase of the Royal Palace when it was attacked in 1841 by the Conchaes, the Lersundis, and the Diego Leons, and at a later period by the part he took in the military insurrection of 1854, resolved to come forward as a candidate to the Cortes for the province of Barcelona. He communicated his intention to General O'Donnell. As these moral dragonnades, which, by an over-strained courtesy, have the name of " elections," are conducted under the eye of the rmilitary authorities, it was thought as well to sound the Captain-General on the subject. O'Donnell beieved that his prot6g6 would not be unwilling to do him a favour, and he accordingly wrote a confidential letber asking him not to take any positive steps to frustrate the hopez of his comrade, General Dulce. An ordinary person, in case the request were inconsistent with the orders he had received from Madrid, would have given to his former benefactor a simple refusal, on the ground of duty as interpreted at the Madrid War-office. Zapatero, it seems, is not an ordinary man; he not only did not reply to O'Donnell, but, as the story runs, sent his letter, in the original, to Narvaez. Narvaez, without mrore delay, laid the document before the Ministers in Council, and then showed it to the Queen. Her Majesty, who on one occasion owed much to the fidelity and gallantry of Dulce, declared that General Zapatero ought to be amply recompensed for his conduct. Narvaez, more prudently, sulggested that the present moment was inopportune, and that if Her Majesty was resolved to give the Captain-General a mark of her Royal gratitude, it were better to do so at a later period, when the service, which was not particularly creditable would not be known. Her Majesty seemed to acquiesce, but to Narvaez's surprise and annoyance he soo6n after decided that the banda of Mari. Luisa should be given to the wife of General Zapatero, it being a distinction of the same value among ladies as the Golden Fleece is among men. She also wrote with her own Royal hand a letter to Zapatero. I give you the anecdote as it circulates among the poltical gossips of Madrid. It is very likely true, though I decline vouching for its aocuraay. Private letters from Bucharest give so delightful an account of the way in which the representative, of the Powers are treated in that happy land, that the height of human felicity muat be the pod of Commisoner in the Danubian Principalities;vast and gorgeously arrayed palaces, of which tle rich furniture is the produce of the workshops of Vienna and Paris; carriages of the newest fashion, with superhuman springs nnd gentlest motion; and Boyards of high degf~ee on the watch to gratify your s3ighte3t caprice-and all gratuitously. The Siybarite of old on his bed of roses felt his dreamy repose ditturbed because a single crumpled leaf was on that couch of odours: one Comxnissioner applied for a new carriage, the soft cushions of the one orginally placed at his disposal being a trifle less yielding than eiderdown. Who would not accept a Commissionership in Wallachia ? The Turkish Commissioner being as he said in his owo territory, chez bui, claimed as a right, and without the superfluity of thanks, all i the luxurious appliances indispensable to the* organizers of the Principalities which the others 1 posess as a favour; and he claimed moreover, an allowance which amounts to about 201. per diem for his part of the work. All this is paid out of the 33:oldo-Wallachian treasury. The French Commissioner, a private letter says, told the deputation of "patriots" that he apprehended they must give up the notion of a foreign prince. Now, as a foreign prince implies union oa the provinces, it is fair to presume that the views of the French Government on that head have been modified. If such be the case, what is to become of " notre Petit Nassau" and the other errant German princes en disponibi.itde It appears that a m3ember of the commission ap. pointedtostudy thequeation oftranportationto New Caledonia has left Paris for London in order to acquire information as to the system of transportation in England, the French Government being resolved to adopt'the principle, and to apply it to its penal settlement. A recent despatch from New Caledonia states that the FrenchCommandant has not sufficient forces at his command; that, the H6ros not arriving, his men were put on half-rations; and that 500 soldiers, in addition, will be required to defend the place against the natives. The Con.tituzticnnelpublishes the following article (cemmuniu)* "$ The labours of the Conference which Is occupied with the regulation of the NeuchAtel affair sre in the French or foreign prees the daily subject of various comments. We are in a position to assert that tho information on which they rest is inacourate and unfounded. The members of the Conference are pledged to the most absolute silence with respect to their deliberations. All the statements which may be published on this subject have, therefore, no other basis but pure conjecture and suppositions necessarily erroneous.l' Several of the mysteries which puzzled mankind have been discovered. The Man mn the Iron Mask is known to have been the twin brother of Louis XIV.; the authorship of the Letters of Junims can no longer be considered a secret; and the author of Waver4ey disclosed himself. But who the person is who now and then sends a mysterious paragraph to the Ministerial organs under the above head is as much a puzzle as ever. Of Monsieur Communiqu.6s statements it may in general be observed, that not only are they untrue, but that, like Rory O'More's dreams, they are to be interpreted by " contraries." The public are so convinced of this fact that I am sure they now believe every word, more perhaps than they ought, of what has been written on the Neuehhtel Conferences. It is probable that miuch of what has bexn said about the details of this Conference may not be literally true, but that the main points of the discussion have been rightly reported I believe. The Emperor would do well to put a stop to these absurd paragraphs, which only convince the public of the failurd of the Conferences to ,ettle the question to the satisfaction of the parties. I am assured that it has been decided in the Municipal Council that the "grand ball," as orlginaUy proposed, will not be given at. the Hotel de ViYle to the Grand Duke Constantine, but only a concert and a dramatic repre'entation, as given to the members of the Paris Congress. Some disappintment is observable among the admirers of the oath uke for whom a reception on an unprecedented sc was intended. The fact of no member of the Imperial family going to meet the Grand Duke at Toulon, as at first proposed, and the Minister of Marine also remaining at home, according to MW. Mocquard, though his intended departure was announced in the Government evening organ, show that changes have been made in the original programme. I have not heard of any more arrests for the last two or three days on account of the plot against the Emperor's person. It is not certain, however, that no more will be made. I have heard some further details relatingtothis newconspiracy,inthe accuracy of which I have reason to believe. As the affair is not yet over,and as various incorrect versions have circulated, I tbink it not uninteresting to mention them. Secret societies never wholly cease to exist in France, but the present is one that was formed about 14 months ago, and the object was to make an attempt on the Emperor's person. It was, in point of fact, a Gunpowder Plot. A person, whose name it is not necessary to mention, a silk weaver by trade and a fanatic in politics, conceived the notion of blowing up the Emperor while he was sitting in his box at the Thetre FranQais. The modern Catesby proceeded to London to communicate his plan to persons from whom he expected to receive encouragement and assistauce. After a conference with them he returned to France, and soon after again repaired to London to arrange the final operations. In the meantime one of his London friends, believing he had reason to suspect that the French Catesby was in reality a secret agent of the authorities sent to entrap him, gave information to the English police. When "Catesby" heard of this fact he became furious, and, anticipating the denunciation, returned hastily to Paris, revealed the plot to the French authorities, and denounced his accomplices. He, with about 30 persons, was at once taken into custody. The affair is now in course of investigation, and will in due time be brought before the Correctional Police-court, when, no doubt, the concoctor of the plot will be produced as the principal witness. It seems that a plan of the part of the theatre where the Emperor is wont to sit, as well as of the external paxts contiguous, was made. Barrels of powder were to be deposited immediatelyi under the box, a train laid on,which was to be carried outside, and the mine was to be sprung while the attention of the Emperor and the audience was absorbed by the scenic representation. The accomplice of the chief conspirator declared that he was nothing more than a police spy, but the police authorities disclaim him altogether. I mentioned the other day that the elections for the new Legislative Body would take place about the end of June. Iwas subsequently informed that sorme of the Prefects had suggested September. I have reason to believe, however, that the original date is the correct one, and that the electoral campaign will commence some day between the 29th and 25th of June. This is the period when the Prefects are wont to make their annual visitation for the military revision; and to save them another journey they will do two things at the same timethe duties of reviSiOn and of electioneering-" two birds killed with one stone." Some deputies will probably lOse their seats but there is little doubt of a great majority for the Government. The Republican party is divided on this, as on other questions. The refugees do not agree 'with their friends at home. Some are for putting forward candidates, and doing everything to insUre their success, but refusing to allow them to take the oaths of allegiance. Others would allow of their taking the oaths, in the hope of forming an Opposition, how-' ever small, in the Chamber. I believe there is nothing yet resolved on, and the Government, of course, will give them as little time as possible to mature their plans. The trial of the two brothers Landri, Lieutenants in the 95th Regimnent of Infantry, and Sergeant Benaguet, of the same regiment, accused of having violently assaulted the wife of a butcher, concluded last evening in their acquittal by the Court-martial, the judges being unanimous. They were set at liberty and ordered to return to their regiment. A letter from Tunis of the 7th inst., received at Marseilles, announces that the Tunisian Admiral Si Hassan, who commands the port of the Goulette provisionally, having beaten end imprisoned an Algerine, a French subject, under pretence that he had refused to execute his orders, the French ViceConsul claimed the man. The Admiral twice refused to deliver him up, and told the Vice-Consul he might complain to the Bey. The Vice-Consul a third time proceeded in full uniform, accompanied by his dragoman, on board the Admiral's ship, and this time with success. He was shortly after called upon to receive the apologies of the AdmiraL The latter presented limnwola at the French Consulate in full dress. A considerable crowd being apprised of what was to take place attended. The repartion was as public as the offenv% and It produced an imraense effect on the entfre populition. Everybody remarked that such an act would not have occurred if General Ker-Eddin, who is the Governor of La Goulette, had beei at his post, but unfortunately he was absent on a mission from the Bey to the Wrench Government. The folowing are the ships of war assembled at Toulon to meet the Grand Duke Constantine.-The slip of the line Bretagne, bearing the flag of Admiral Trehouart; the ships of the line Algesiras, Ulm Arcole, Austerlitz, Eylau, and Su.en; the stam frgate Cacique, the steam corvettes Duchayla and L 'ace, and the steam sloops Requin, and Eclaireur. It is said that the Grand Duke is to arrive at Toulon on the 20th, on board the ship of the line Viborg, escorted by the steam frigates Castor, Oriofih, and Polkau. The Russian Admiral Nordman has arrived at Toulon.- AUSTRIA. (inom oiR o consrO?z"uq.) VIENNA, APRI 17. The relations between the Vienna and St. Petersburg Cabinets are most unsatisfactory, as Prince Gortschakoff loses no opportunity of displaying is intense dislike of Austria and the Austrians. As you are aware, Count Esterhazy, the Austrian Minister at the Court of Russia, is likely to receive a prolonged leave of absence, and the icterehi.sche Zeitunzg to-day tells the Viennese that the Magyar magnate is about to leave St. Petersburg, "in order that he may be in HEungary while their Majesties are there." In reality it is of little consequence whether Count Esterhazy is atVienna or at St. Petersburg, " for he has hardly more society in the Rusisan capital than he would have if he were residing in Tobolsk or in any other Siberian town." As my informant could not have intended to insinuate that Count Esterhazy had been. "cut" by the Russians, it must be supposed they have treated him with such icy coldness that he has altogether withdrawn from their society. The Ost-Deutsche Post of to-day has an "inspired" article of which an epitome mut be given, as it will enable you to see that Russia and Austria are now playing the very same game which led to the interruption of the diplomatic relations between this Government and that of Turin. The Vienna organ of the press speaks to the Brussels Nord and at its patrons:- "The WlYord allows no day to pass without attacking Austria. The writers of the leading articles and the correspondents in the various capitals have received the same instructions. They are to write against the interests of Austria, to endeavour to make mischief between her and the Western Powers, and to render her policy in Italy and in the East suspected. In short, the Nord has a ' mission of hatred to fulfil.' The events of the years 1853-1856 severed the close ties which formerly united Austria and Rusia, but there Is no good reason why the two countries should be hostile to each other. Is it the fault of Austris that Russia, when she undertook the radical care of the sick man, deceived herself in respect to the policy of the Imperial Government? If the St. Petersbarg Cabinet had listened to the well-meant advice which it received from Vienna all would have been well, andAustria would not have been obliged to expend more than 200 millions of florins for maintaining her large army on a war footing. In fact, Austria has guite as much cause to complain of Russia as Russia has to inveigh against Austria. The Austrian press freely expresses its opinions in regard to the aspirations of Russia, but it doos not make it its sole business so to do. In a letter recently received by the Nord from Vienna it is said that the Austrian press never has an elevated or, generous idea. If by 'an elevated idea' it is mneant that Russia is to rule over the world, the charge I brought against the Austrian press is perfectly well-founded. It has been seen that the Nord is capable of entertaining a 'generous' idea, for it has done all in its power to excite the fanaticism of the Montenegrins, and to persuade them that it would be a tweasonable action towards themselves to acknowledge the eerainr6 of the Porte. If the Vienna press would adopt such elevated and generous ideas it might perhaps enjioy the favour of the patrons of the Nord, and be found worthy to take rank with the Northern Bee and Inrciidt." In one of its recent numbers the Northerm Bee spoke at some length of the diplomatic rupture between Austria and Sardinia, and wound up with the following singular remarks- " The present quarrel between Austria and Sardinia showvs how uncertain, howr unstable, is the present state of things in Europe. Almost every State has some outstanding account to settle with the other. Euarope may be cornpared to an old coat. It has been so often altered and patched that one feels inclined to throw it aside, and to haves now one made. At present, however, we are unable to say what kind of cut it ought to have." THE NEUCHATEL QJESON. The Paris correspondent of the Ind4pendance Belge has sent to that journal the foUlowing analysis of the memorandum presented by Dr. Kern to the Conference on the 3d inst.:- " On the first point it is declared that the renunciation by the King of Prussia must be complete. Switzerland Ce.u. not concede to him the title of Prince of Neuchftel rad Valangin. At all events, if the King wishes to continute the title in his dynasty no claim upon Swi:zarlanid shall result therefrom, and its non-recognition shall be deCared by an offlcial act. The memorandum referring to a decree of the three States of NeuchAtel in the month of November, 1707, which invested Frederick of Brandenburg with the sovereignty of the Canton, establishes that the title of ' Prince of NeuchAtel' never was an apanage of tTe Crown of Prussia. " Dr. KerA then touches upon the amnesty for all political and military offences connected with recent events. Switzerland admits that the amnesty ought to include all political offences of any description anterior to the event - of September, 1856; ordinary offences are, of course, ezeluded from the amnesty. " As regards the 5th point, concerning an indemnity for the rights of sovereignty, the Swiss Fnvoy rejects it, observ ing that the law expenses and the cost of the military occupation must remain reserved, the Federal Council declaring beforehand that, if the King of Prussia does not ask for money, it will not insist upon repayment of the expenses of the occupation. The Federal Council calculates the cost of calling out the troops, legal expenses, &c., caused by the events of Septemnber, at 5,180,003f. " As regards the Church property, Dr. Kern declarea that it never has been interfered with; it was an. nexed to the State domain, which on its part engaged itsell constitutionally to provide for the wants of the clergy. Private charitable institutions naturally come under the common law of the land. As regards public institutions, their maintenance is guaranteed by the Constitution. " The Swiss Envoy then alludes to the Pury inheritance. The town of Neuchatel was declared heir by the will in the usual legal manner. Should its claim be contested, it ought to be decided by the courts of law, and not by diplomacy. "1 As regards the revision of the Constitution, it is peremptorily established that the Cantonal Constitutiou decrees, Art. 72, that if the Grand Council, or at least 3,000 electors, ask for a revision, it is for the electoral colleges to decide whether it is to teke place by a Constituent Assembly or by the Council; and, moreover, the Federal Constitution, Art.42, admits equally to the enjor aent of pflitical rights every Swiss citizen who has resided for two years in a canton, sessing the electoral qualifications Prescribed by the uostitution. Strangers never enjoyed politicl rights in Switzerland, nor do they at the present moment. "F;inally, the present Constitution of Neuchhtel was. voted by the Neuch.telese alone, as they were called upon for the first time to pronounce themselves upon the future form of government of the Canton."
TAM3PERTNG wrrm PoisoNous Mz3TDsCnEs.-On Friday, at the Mary Queen of Scots, in the parish of Jarrow, near the old tolgate in Gateshead, an inquest w-.s held on the body of Elizabeth Bowman, aged 77, the w;dow of a busbandcman. Deceased was an industrious, hardworking woman, going out to wash, and labouring in her humble vocation up to the close of the past week. She suffered from ehronic cough, and felt weak and unwell on Saturday night. At a late hour her daughter, Mary Bowman, purchased for her a pennyworth of "paregoric" (the camphorated tincture of opium) of Mr Fenwick (a quarter of an ounce), the whole of which she took at once. She then fell into a profo-und sleep, under symptoms which in- ired alarm; and Mr. Robinson, surgeon, was called in. Mirfound her breathing stertorously, the pupil of the eye widely dilated, the action of the heart slow and laboured, and the whole body in a state of collapse. Suitable treatment was resorted to, but she never rallied, and died on Monday forenoon. The dose of paregoric would not accouant for death in a younger and mnore robust person, but in so old and weak a subject as the deceased it might hasten dissolution. The cause of death he should say was serous aoplexy It was not commonly known, Mr. Robinson observed, among persons who made use of " paregoric dixir," thatpit was a preparation of opium, in combination with camphwr, another powerful sedative. Improperly administered, it was a dangerous medicine; yet, when .he was called in to the deceased, and asked if anything had been given to her, the answer was that "she h.d only taken some paregoric." In reply to the co. roner, Mdr. Robinson observed that if no more thin a quarter of an ounce had been administered the quantity of opium taken would be half a grain; but he underatood at first that the dose was half an ounce. Deceased's daughter stated, on examination, that her mother objected to landanum, and when recommended to her by a neighbour refused to take any. She was not aware that pagegoric was a preparation of opium. Mrs. Fenwick, it appeared, de .Ilt in laudanum, but the coroner aud jury were satisfied thlt no mistake had been committed; that paregoric, and not laudanum, had been administered to the deceased. The verdict was therefore, " Death from serous * I hastened by paregorio ;" and the foreman (Mr. Guthre) ex preesed his ogPinion that some restriction should he plao.d o iealorpoisons. IIe thought it wrong to allowr asy and ev-ery person, howvever ignorant on such subjects, o Tolid the most d&ngerous dxugs.-GaXeMed O*eiucr.
ME MURBAIN, O CATTLE-PLAGUE. (FRO OU VIENlA OORRFSPONn There are three complaints which on the continent are popularly called " Vieh-seuche " (cattle plagues). The first is a catarrhal affection of the lungs; the aecond a pulmonary complairt with typhoid symptoms; and the third a highly contagious typhus (typhus boum owtgiosus). In letters which have appeared in Thie Times Mr. Reddliffe speaks of the pulmonary complaint with typhoid symptoms; Mf. Gamgee of the contagious typhus, which is the real cattle-plague (Rmder pent), or murrain of the Steppe; and Dr. Greenhow of the " luig disease," which may mean either the simple catarrhal affection of the lungs or the pulmonary complaint with typhoid symptoms. As it is doubtful which of the murrains is now raging in those countries from which cattle, hides, &c., have recently been exported to England, the distinctive symptoms of all three will now be described. The principal symptoms of simple catarrhal affection of the lungs are-first, shiveriRg at the commencenient of the malady; second, sadness and prostration of strength; third, the pulse is quicker than usual, and there is fever; fourth, the skin feels dry; fifth, the cough, which is at first dry and hollowr, ad comes by fits and starts. A fter a lapse of four or five days the cough gets " loose," and there is a discharge of phlegm; a rattling noise is heard when the animal draws its breath, and a frothy mucus esapes from its nostrils when it allowrs its head to droop. It is only under unfavourable circumstances, such as immoderate excitement, a naturally bad constitution, or injudicious treatment, that the catarrhal inflammation of the lungs ends fatally, but a chronic secretion of phlegm and asthmatic cough often remain for a considerable time after the anlimal is convalescent. The "lung disease," combined with typhus, may be divided into three periods. The symptoms of the first period, during which there is no fever, are-sadness and prostration of strength; secondly, drooping head and pendulous ears; thirdly, eyes fixed, without loss either of lustre or of colour (in vigorous animals the eyes are oftenred and fiery, but dry); fourthly,theskinof the nostrilspale andthe inside of the mouth " slimy ;" fifth, the temperatuie of the body low, with horns, ears, and feet cool; sixth, the skin dry and tense (stretched), the hair lutreless, rough, and bristly, and erected along the spine; seventh, breathing difficult. The first period sometimes lasts a fortnight or three weeks; the second, or feverish period, lasts three or four day. T'ne symptoms are those above described, with feverish movements. The diseased animal has fits of shivering, considerable exacerbation in the evening, andreionof fever towards the middle of the day. After the cold or aguish fits are over the reaction is much less violent than in other inflammatory complaints. -Each paroxysm of fever is accompanied byan acceleration of the respiration, vhich is audible, and often accompanied by a moanintg sound. The weakness and ex;haustion of the animal are very great; the temperature of the ears, horns, and legs changes continually-now warm and now cold; the skin is dry and rough, and looks as if dust was strewn on it; the hair is erect, and the eyes, which are opened wide, are projecting, dry, shining, and fixed. The pupil is dilated. The nostrils are covered with a slimy secretion, which the suffering animal frequently removes with its tongue; the teeth are loose, the loins are so sensitive that the pressure of the hand cannot be borne without shrinking, and the pain in the chest increases. The animal lies down but seldom, and when it does so it is on the side on which the lung is affected. If both lungs are diseased the animal rests on its breastbone, with its legs under its body and its head and neck stretched out. The alvine secretion is often either entirely suppressed or very scanty. The urine is dark in colour and pungent in smell. Durieah, the third period, which commonly ends in cleaththe uneasiness and agitation of the animal are extreme. It continually changes its position and draws back from the crib to the length of its tether. The eyes sink and become glazed, and the lids faU as if the animal were about to sleep. The horns, ears, and nose are cold, the mouth is filled with offensive phlegm and slaver, and an ilr-coloured secretion flows from the nostrils. The animal gnashes its teeth,which are loose and shaky, the hair becomes more and more bristly, and the emaciation is rapid. At this period of the disease the pulse is often above 100 a-minute. The real cattle-plague, or, as it is caUed in Austria, the " L6ser-Dirre," has four periods. During the first period, which begins about five days after the infection has been taken, the following symptoms are observable :-1. The animal is generaly languid, its movements are heavy, its gait is tottering, and it is less sensible than usual to outward impressions; in other cases it bellows and beats the ground with its hoofs, and is unusualy unruly and vicious. 2. The appetite is often much greater than usual, but after the animal has swallowed its food it appears inattentive to what is passing around it, and hangs its head and ears. 3. When the animal rises from the earth it does not stretch itself as healthy animals usually do, and instead of sinking its back it arches it. 4. The eye has more lustre than usual, and its vessels are slightly reddened. 5. Tremulous movements are perceptible in the skin, and the hair on some parts of it becomes rough. 6. After the fourth or fifth day the animal coughs at intervals and often groans. 7. The animal licks its chaps less than usual. 8. No strong pressure with the hand can be borne, and the back immediately sinks if the loins are squeezed. 9. The " droppings" are drier and less fiurowed than is usual. On the eighth day after the infection the plague is regularly declared. The symptoms are :-1. Aguish paroxysms, and often a twitching of the whole skin. 2. Bristling of the hair. 3. Trembling of the limbs, and particularly of the hind quarters. 4. During the paroxysm the animal is generaly very uneasy; it stamps, holds up its head, and shakes it continuaUy. The vigorous cattle are very violent in their movements, have a wild eye, snort and bellow, and devour their food greedily. The weak and aged beasts, which are less wild and unruly, shake their heads and grind their teeth. 5. The roots of the horns and the hanging ears are sometimes very hot and sometimes cool. 6. The chaps and muzzle are dry, the interior of the mouth is of a light red and " steaming hot," the gums swollen and spongy, and the incisors somewhat loose. The gums have frequently spots of a deep red. 7. The sensitiveness of the loins increases. 8. The skin is extremely tense. 9. The pulsation is accelerated. 10. A single (not continuous) violent, hoUow, and convulsive cough, which is totally different from any other. 11. The rumination is incomplete and interrupted. 12. The alvine excretion is scanty, dark-sometimes almost black, parched, and deeply furrowved. The discharge takes place very frequently. 13. The tail is either extended in a horizontal line or used to strike the sides of the animal, which continualy looks round to its hind quarters. 14. The urineis of a high red colour. 15. It is frequently the case that air bladders can be felt under the skin on the back and loins. 16. The fever increases in the evening, and becomes less violent in the morning. 17. The milk in cows diminishes, and in some cases is altogether dried up. During the third period, which begins on the ninth or 10th day from the infection, all the above-mentioned symptoms increase in violence. The animal is excessively weak and sad, stands at a distance from the crib, and hangs its head almost down to the ground. If the lungs are much affected it lies down a great deal, but if not it remains on its legs. The emaciation is extreme. The eyes begin to run, and a clear white, viscous fluid flows from the nose. By degrees the tears thicken and form a crust which half covers the eye, the discharge from the nose becomes cloudy and "glandery," the tongue is flaccid, and the breath has a peculiar and almost putrid smelL The rumination ceases entirely. The alvine secretions are now watery, and are ejected or rather squirted out with violence. The animal suffers greatly from tenesmus. If there is no diarrhena, which is sometimes the case, the hind part of the body is greatly sswollen. On the 13th or 14th day, when the complaint has reached the highest pitch, the fourth period begins. The animal can hardly keep on its Iegs, a thick ash-gray fluid runs from its glazed eyes, a corrosiTe secretion escaDes from its nose, a thick phlegm fills its mouth, and the putrid exhalation becomes almost unbearable. The skin of the mouth and the gums is dried up, " and the tallowlike slin of the animal peels off in great flakes." The serous and even bloody alvine weretion is dischargedalmost withoutinterruption; the head of the suffering animal is continually twisted round to its hind quarterg. Death generally ensues on or aboat the 17th day after the infection. The symptoms 6f the three different " murrains" have been given at considerable length, in order that those veterinary surgeons who have never had an opportunity of seeing cattle which were affected with either of them may be able to distinguish one disease from the other.
THE MERCANTIL MfARrNE. TO THE EDITORE OF TE3 TIMES. Sir,-The letter of " A Shipowner,' in your impression of Thursday, refers to a question in which I think he is nistaken in supposing the publio is not likely to take any very deep interest. After the Soathampton meeting a rmeeting on tho subject of the Board of Traae investigations was held in Liverpool, in one of the largest public rooms in the town, and despite the attractions of the oratorv of Mr. William. Ewart Gladstone, who was apeaking in the neigh. bourhood at the same hour, the placo of meeting was not merely crowded to excess by mercantile commanders, mer. ehants, and shipowners, but hundreds had to leave unable to obtann admittance. This, surely, is some evidence of a public interest in the profession. At the Liverpool meeting the prinoipal grier noe oomplained of-namely, the manner in which the Board of Trade investigations are conducted, was well and tempo. ratelystatedby commandersof ships of the mereantilemarne service. It was not, as the ' Shipowner" seems to think, a complaint, that the causes into wreois and casualties should be strictly investigated, but that the tribunal before which, at present, such investigations are made is not a competent one, consisting, as it does, of two justices or a stipendiary magistrate, and a nautical assesor appointed by the Board of Trade. It is well known that the profession of seamanship, both in its scientific and practical details, abounds in technicalities which to landamen are so much gibberish; few if any of our justioes or stipendiary magistrates understand them, and, as the main points which arise on every inquiry require nautioal skill and knowledge, the consequence is that the nautical assessor is practically the sole judge. This nautical assessor is generally an officer attached to the marine department of the Board of Trade, generally holds a commision in the Royal Navy, and is not unfrequently, as in the ease of the Lady Ebrington, a member of the Marine Department of the .Board of Trade. On the report made by the Court so constituted to the Board of Trade depends the cancelling or suspending of the certificates of the master and his officers, and on these certificates their professional character and entire worldly prospects rest. I am far from saying that the decisons are alway wrong, but there aro cases in which the Board of Trade have beenforced to admit it has come to a wrong decision by returning the certificate of almaster within the period for which it was adjudged to be suspended, and in which, after a certificate was declared to be cancelled, the master was permittedto pass an examination, and receive a new certificate; and the Board, although it poasesses the power to cancel, does not possess the powerto reverseitsown decisions, Upon the report of the court of inquiry depends, hen, te decsion, and masters of the mercantile marine feelthat so great *power ought not to be, as it now is, vested in oneperson only, the nautical assessor-no matter how able he Is or how conversant with his profession. The court of inquiry is practically a court of tfhe utmost penal judicature; but it differs from all others in the extraordinary practice of examining the person who is being tried, anL using his evidence against himself, and in the absence of anything in the nature of a jury. The officers of the Royal Navy, to which the assessor generally belongs, no doubt frequently posse6s high scientific attainments and great practical knowledge, but they are accustomed to have their orders carried otlt by large bodies of men, and are quite unaware of what, under similar circumstances, can be effected by the limited crew of a British merchant ship. They may have passed in steam, but have not had the command, nor have they the slightest practical notion of the duties of the commander of an ocean-going mail steamer the owners of which are encouraged by Government subsidie3 to maintain in all weathers and under all circumstances the highest rate of speed. In the case where the nautical assessor is also a member of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade he practically decides on his own report. Comment on such a practice is not necessary. What the mercantile marine service seeks is, that such powers shall not be confided to one person, but to a court somewhat similar in constitution to the courts of inu into the causes of wrecks and casualties in the navy. they do not ask that the members of such courte should be entirely mercantile commpanders, but they seek that there should be a sufficient number of practical men upon them to give to the man who isso unfortunate as to be brought before them the confidenee of receiving evenhanded justice and of having his case thoroughly understood. The local Marine Boards, with the addition of some practical men, would not be objected to, but why the charge and supervision of the Mercantile Marine should be almost entirely given to oflicers of the Royal Navy I am at a loss to conceive. That there ari men in the merchant service sufficiently competent for the duty the circumstance of one of the members of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade being from that class sufficiently shows. The merchant officer has to pass an examination las dificult and strict in its practical and scientific details as the naval officer, and, ulke the latter, his entire life, from the time he obtains his certificate until he retires from sea, is, with few exceptions, passed in the practical exercise of his profession. There are few navaf officers who have gained the rank of post-captain without spending many years of idleness on shore. During the Russian war we heard no complaints that the transport service was conducted In an incompetent or slovenly manner, but we do know, with bitter experience, tba,t, had the advice of the merchant commander been istened to, that fearful November loss in the Black Sea would have been avoided. The services rendered have not been recognized by Parliament, bat they are known to the nation. The mercantile marine captainsask, also, for revision of the Merchant Shipping Act1 1854, complaining, among other things, of the powers given to seamen in foreign ports to leave their ships and join men-of-war, a circumstance which has often led, not merely to a long voyage and the loss of profit to the owner, but has not unfrequently, from leaving ships short-handed. led to their destruction and to the loss Of life, Surely sailors can be sent out in draughts for the navy as easily as soldiers for the army, and they ask that the fies and penalties with which it ahounds should also be revised. At present there are 52 fines which a master may incur in any one voyage, amounting in all to more than 2,0001., and sundry imprisonments which would take up a few years of his life. In addition to these matters, which are grievances, they have resolved upon a course which cannot fail to gratify the " Shipowner'" and the public by the formation of an association having for its object "C to take every legitimate step to elevate to their proper position officers of the mercantile marine service of the united kingdom, and to promote the interests of the service generally, and the improvement of nautical knowledge by the collection of approved new works, meteorological and other reports, and instruments, &c, in reference thereto; the redress of grievances and the attainment of all beneficial objects which may affect the general or particular interests of the masters and officers Of the mercantile marine service, when such designs may be more effectually prosecutead by an associated body than by individual exertions." This is better than any improvement of the profession by a particular uniform or by Act of Parliament. It is an index of the growing intelligence of the class, for ambition as the first step in the lauder of elevation. There is no property in the world so little under the control of the owner as a ship. In charge of the master, she rides the seas on her mission of commerce and peace to the uttermost ends of the earth, commanded by a man of practised industry and scientific attainments, and with his owner's fortune depending on his honesty. With acquirements of no superficial character such men have sometimes failed in their duty; and there has been among them a want of thlt esprit de corps which in other professions-the Axmy,Navy, Law, Church, and Medicine-has so much con. tributedtoraisethegeneralstandingoftheseprofessions Each marinerhasbeen a mere isolated fragment, careless of more than the mere passing hour, unrecognized, without position or standing save on the quarterdeck, and there taciturn and often harsh. These men have penetrated to every portion of the habitable globe, yet their observations and experiences have been lost to the world, for they have come back to civilization and have found themselves the veriest units which exist; their observations have been allowed to remain unknown, their experience has been useless. it is the collective experience of many able men which has elevated the other professions, and it is by cultivating a unity of interest which has given them their high social standing and respectability, making the fault of a member the disgrace of the Thi feeling has begun to do its work among the mercantile marine officers. In the association they have formed at Liverpool they have received the cooperation and support of the leading merchants and shipowners of that port, and it cannot be supposed that it will rest there, or that other ports will be behind in similar organizations Once nnit as a body, as arecogaizedprofessionandemployment, there is no reason why the profession of the sea should take rank under any othier. Brorght into union, and,with united action andincitement for inquiry,we may surely hope, before long, for most valuable information concerning every portion of the world which it is possible to reach by sea When our mercautile commanders feel that what they have seen and what they can relate is not only not lost, but is of essential value to the whole world, their inquiries will be stimulated, their observations extended, and their profession gradually attain that position in the social satus which it is their wish to acquire.

LA W B PO*T. COTRT OF CHACERY, L1NCOLN'S-,NN. APRIL 20. ;ThPuIM V. POWYS. (Before the LORID CHANOELLOR.j This was an appeal from a decree of the Master of the Bolls reating to the ronrstruplion of the wilU -f PhUlis S;tephens, late of Prospect-h'U, in the county of Berks. :The testatrix by her will, datad the 22d of April, 1856i, two days atter the deatb of her husbind, William Stehens,aud .tithoat seeing his ill, stated, "Whereas I have reason to helieve that my late husband, William Stephens, h.s by his will beqiueathed to me, as *esiduary le3atce or otherwise, certain sams of money ir the pablic funds and other securities ;" and then gave and bequeachcd all and every such saums as she was legally elmpowere,l to dispose of to the plaintiffs in trust to pay three lagatee therein named, 1001. each, absolutely. The will then wena on in favour of two of the defendants as foUowvs:"'To Phillip Powys and his wife the same amount and on the s_me trusts and conditione as are named in my husband's will." The testatrix finally gave one moiety of her reodduary personal estate to " Mr. and Mrs PhiJlip Powys anud their children on the same trusts as before alluded to.,, Williarn Stephens, the husband of the testatrix, by his will gave to the defendant William Powys 1,0001., and to his trustees (the plaintifis) the snm of 20,0001- Three per Cent. Annuities upon trust to pay the divdends to tlhe wife of Phillip Powvs during her life, and after her deceas to dlivide the prncipal in certain roportions ataong her children. The MIaster of the Rolls held that the words in the will of Philis Stephens-"the same amount" to Philhp lPowys and his wife-had reference to the antecedent lega. cies of 100Z., and that Mr. and Mrs. Powys were only entitled to have that amount settled for their benefit. From this decision Mrs. Powvys appealed. Mr. Rolt, Mr. FoUett, and Mr. Dickinson appeared for the appellant; the Attorney-General, Mr. Lloyd, and Mr. Rowehffe for the respondents; Mr. R. Palmer and Mr. Amphlett for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Pole for Philip Powys. The LORD CUANCELLOB, at the conclusion of the argu. ments said, he could not concur with the view taken of the ease sy the Master of the Rolls. It appeared to him that the only question to be solved was, whether the appellants were right in their construction of the bequest, or whether the gift itself was not absolutely void for uncertainty? He was of opinion that the testatrix, by using the words in the frst bequest to Mr. and Mmrs Powys "on the same truats and conditions as aro named in my husbaud's will," and in the gift of the residue to MIr. and Mrs. Powys and childiren " on the same trusts as before alluded to," intended to inelude all the trusts in her husband's will, whether in favour of Mr. and Mrs. Powys or their children. Such being his view, he had first to consider what amount the testatrix intended to give them under the phrase "the same amount." It appeared to him quite absurd to suppose that Mrs. Stephens intended therebyto settle 1001. only on Mrs. Powys for life, with remainder to her children, at a time she was disposing of so large an amount of money. The most natural way of constuing her will wo to hold that she meant both the amounts the Powys family were to take, and the trusts respecting it, were to be ascertained from ler husband's will Strictly speaking, there were no trusts in the will of William Stephens in favour of Philip Powys and his wife but there were trusts in favour of Mrs. Powys for life, and after her death for the benefit of her children, so that the trusts might be fairly described as being in favour. of Mr. and IMrs. Powys and their children. After some doubt upon the case he was of opinion that the words were sufficiently clear to warrant his holding that Mrs. Powys was entitled to have a sun of 20,0001. Three per Cent. Annuities settled upon her and her children, on the same trusts as those created by the will of William Stephens.-Appeal allowed. (Before the LosDS JusTicEs of APPEAL.) EWART V. WILLIAMNS. This eswe, which has been before the Court many times since the filing of the bDIl, nearly a dozen years ago, related, in its present stage, to a Point of practice as to evidence, of somue importance, hut of no general interest whatever.

ROLLf' COURT, CHANCERY-LA2,E. APRIL 20. IN RE PRIMROSE SETT.FMr NT-Jrnal,N' (Before e MASTER of tOLe ROLLS.) This was a petition for the appointment of new trustees in respect to various sums of money, amounting to about 17,00u1., which on the marriage of the petitioner were settled to her use. A Mr. Owen and a Mr. Eagar were the original trust3es, but, on the latter going to the Cape of Good Hope, Leopold Redpath, the convict, was appointed trustee in his placo. Shortly after his appointment as such trustee Rpath's deliuquencies were exposed and ]reviously to being transpoited he was made a bankrupt. Iis trade and official assignees, upon being applied to, refused to sign a written disclaimer of his being beneficially interested in the trust fund in question, and this they did on the plea that Redpath obstinately refused to give any information to them as to whether he had any other than a trust interest in the fund. HiS HONOUR said that, in his opinion, the necessity for the present petition had been caused solely by the conduct of the assignees, who, rcaldng no claim, did not choose to giVe a disclaimer in writing, which the petitioner might show to the Bank, in order to enable her to get a transfer of stok. it was a case of great importance, and did not apply merely to assignees, trustees or to any other class in particular, but to all classes of the community in reference to their dealing with each other. If, in the course of events, a fund were so placed that the beneficial owners could not get it without an act being done by another person which unvolved no risk or responsibility on his part, this Court would not permit such person to say,"I will mnako no claim, but every passive obstacle I can throw in your way IwilLw I wil do nothing against our claim, but I wil do nothing to assist you." If such conduct rendered an application to this Court necesary, the person guilty of acting so unamiably must pay the costs. Mr. R. PAj.3iFKR.-There is the question of jurisdiction, which I submit to your Honour must materially affect the question of costs. Iis HONOUR.-UJpon consideration, Mr. Palmer, I am of opinion that is so, and I will make the order simply for the appointment of new trustees, and make no order as to costs.

The injunction, therefore, was asked for upon an affidavit verifying these facts. The VIcx-CB?ANCRLLOR made the order. (BfcJore Vice-Ch,aneoUor Sir JoHN STUART.) KING V. SINCLAIR. Mr. MALLNS (with whom was Mr. Beales) appeared in support of a petition of Archdeacon Sinclair and others, praying that m case the petitiorers should succeed in obtaiing a grant from the Crown of a pieco of land at P'inner, in Mfiddlesex, which had been found to have escheated to Her Majesty, they should be at liberty to sell the same, and pay the proceeds to the Corporation of the Sons of the C ergy, upon trust to apply the dividends arising from those proceeds among such widows of deceased clergymen as the directors of the corporation should think proper. The late Miss Charlotte Itebecca Howard, after having by her will, dated in March, 1854, given the residue of her personal property to her executors, of whom the venerab Archdeacon Sinclair was one, to be by them appled to such charitable purposes as they in their absolute discretion sbhould think fit, by a codicil to her will, dated in May, 1854, directed her executors to apply the residue of her personal property in erecting on a piece of freehold land at Pinner, in Middlesex, 20 alimshouses, in the form of a crescent, for the benefit of the widows of officers of the British army and navy, being Protestant Christians. In July, 1854, Miss Howard entered into a contract with bui ders to erect, for the sum of 6,38Z0., 19 houses on the before-mentioned piece of land, to be called Howe,rd's Charity, and the builders immediately afterwards comnmenced the construction of those houses. In the ensuing November Miss Howard died, and, as she had not complied with the requirements of the Statute of Mortmain in relation to the charity proposed to be founded by her, her executors were *mable to carry ouat her intentions and to continue the works in relation to the charity. Miss Howard was also found to have been illegitsnate, and the before-mentioned piece of land had therefore eseheated to the Crown. After paying the builders the amount expended by them on the proposed houses and a sum in respoot of the loss of their contraot, aind after also paying the costs of the suit, it was calculated that there would be a surplus, including the value of the land on which the houses were to have been built, of about 1,6001. As the object contemplated by Miss Howard could not beaccomupised, and as the executors had been unable to ascertain tat a charity, existed having for its purpose the relief of the wiows of naval and military officers, it was proposed by the executors, if they should succeed in obtaining from the Crowne a grant of the escheated piece of land, to sel it, and to pay the proceed of such sale, and the residue of Miss dton po al roperty, to the Corporation of the Sns of the Clergy, upon trust, to apply the dividends arising therefrom among such widows of deceased CIler g on as the directors should think fit. Ho. wickens appeared for the AttorneysGenera. The Vro-ChnANcLLor waid that, althougr the Corpora. tion of the Sons of the Clergy was a most excellent charity, he did not think that the payment proposed to be m2ade to that body by the executors would be an express application of the proceeds of sale of the eseheated piece of land. He would giv the subject his consideration, and the petition mi ght be mentioned onx the next petition-day. (Before YVice zanceltr Sr W. P. WOOD.) SCORE V. SCORE.

COURT OF Q JXSB1'CH.. WF mINs.'xR APRiT. 20 T}I QUEEN V. TRE JTUSTICES OF GLOCESTERSRlIRE. Vltings in Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and JusimCS WIGT", 33ERLE, and CnoMyxoN.) 1Zir 1. H1EIGIM (with whom was Mr. W. Payne) moved for a rule to show cause why a mandamus should not issue to the justices of Glocestershire, commanding them to order pyrcent of certain fees and allowancesto Mr. Gaisford, one of tho coroners for the county. The learned counsel said, the present application had been rendered Decsy by te circustnce that coroners wrere obstructed in the performance oE thei duty bz the narrowr viewv takern by the moagistrtes of that duty, and their dispesitlon to disaflowv the rosts Of holding inquests except in a limited class of Lord CAoPB}LL S. aid that in many cases. he believ^d, the nmagistrates hai rendered great service in checking the abuse of coroners in holding inquests where there was no pretence for their so doing. Sit?. T'HxlsloEr. said, the magistrates appeared to have laid down a rule that where the jury found that the person had died bythe visitation of God, or by accident, the coroner was not entitled to hold an inquest, and that his charges in suoh cases ought to be disallowed. The chairman of the (Glc-sterEhire Quarter Sessions had published a paiapFHet, in which be had laid down the rule that unless the2e was violence, either known or suspected and the jury f("iiid that theparty died by the visitation of God, or by accidcnt, the coroner was not entitled to hold an inquest. Lord CAMPBELL said, it could not I . laid down as a gneeral rule that where the jury fouud that the party died by the visitation of God the expenses ought to be disallowed. Mr. Justice BRLE observed that he iad been officially spoken to on circuit by magistrates to know in what way they could check the growiDg evil of coroners improperly holding inquests. Lord CAsMPBELL said that in some instances the feelings of relatives were very improperly outraged. Sir F. TIEASIGER was aware that that was the case, but at the same time be contended that when coroners properly discharged their duties they ought to be supported. In one of the cases upon which the learned counsel now applied to the Court, a woman aged 60 was found lyiDg dead upon the floor. She had not been attended by anly medical man, and she had mot been subject to any known disease. The coroner had travelled 16 miles to where the body was lying, and held an inquest, and the jury found that the party died " by the visitation of God." IL another case he received notice from a police-officer that a child 16 months old had been scalded to death. He travelled 11 miles to hold an inquest, and the jury found that the child had died by an "accidental scalding." The account of the expense of holding these inquests was laid before the quarter sessions, and taken into consideration at an adjournment, when the magistrates allowed the coroner the disbursements made by him in holding the twvo inquests, but they disallowed the coroner's fee of 11., to which he was entitled under the 5th of George fIl., cap. 29, and a further.feeof 6s. 8d., to which he was entitled under the 1st of Victoria, cap. 68. The learned counsel said the former of those statutes gave the coroner 20s., and 9d. a mile for each mile he travelled, for holding an inquest, and upon that statute several cases had been decided, which the magistrates seemned to think warranted them in disallowing the coroner's fees in those cases. Those cases were "Rex v. the Justices of Kent" (nlE. 229), and " Regina v. the Great Western Railway Company" (3 Q. B. 333), Mr. Justice ERLB said, it seemed to have been held that where the coroner irnproperly held an inquest the disbursemeate actually rnade should be allowed. Sir F. THESIGER contended that by allowing the disbursements the magistrates admitted that the inquegt was properly held, and that the coroner was entitled to his fees. The learned counsel read a passage from the chairman's pamphlet, in which he laid down the rale that the mere fact of a sudden death was not sufficient for holding an inquest; there must also be a "known or reasonable suspiclonof violence." Mr. Justice ERLE said, he thought that was very nearly a true rule. Sir F. TmEcSIGEB said that, while it was of importance to check the holding of improper inquests, it was also desirable that the duties of coroner should not be interfered with, and he hoped the Court would grant the writ in order that the question might be discugsed. Lord CAsiPBELL. said, it was desirable that a rale should be laid down for the protection of coroners as well as the ratepayers of the county, and for that purpose the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted. CURILEWIS V. THE EARL OF MORNLNGTON. Mr. EDWVIN JAMES, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Hance), moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to reduce the verdict to 3751. The action was brought against the Earl of MLornington to recover the amount of a tailor's bill for goods supplied to the Hon. Mr. Wellesley, his son, who died intestate. An account of goods supplied, amounting to 1,0001., had been sent in in 1843, and when an application was maade by the plaintiff for money on account the intestate gave the bill now in question, and the question was whether the acceptance of that bi took the case out of the Statute of Limitations, and entitled the plaintiff to recover for the whole of the account which hadc been sent in in 1843. The learned counsel contended that, as there was a running account and no appropziation, the case was not taken out of the statute. Lord CAMPBELL said the case was quite clear, for there was only one account due. The case was nite similar to that of " Walker v. Butler" (6 E. and B., 562), decided by this Court during his (Lord Campbell's) absence at the Central Criminal Court, in which he entirely concurred. The other judges being of the same opinion, the rule was refused. PLUNY V. THE EASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. J. WILnDE, Q.C., moved for a cert'orari to bring up an inquisition of a sheriff. The case arose under the Lands IClauses Consolidation Act, under which the plaintiff had claimed compensation for an injury to land not taken by the company. The sheriff had submitted to the jury, as matter on which they might give comnensation, matter which the law did not authorize, The flindng was therefore ultra vires, and a certiorari would lie. The plaintiff claimed compensation for the noise made by the company's engines, and the shaking of his house, and the effluvium from waste water discharged at the station. He also complained that the privacy of his premises had been invaded, and he claimed compensation for being overlooked. The under-shetiff told the jury that the noise, &c., was no round for compnsation; but that the overlooking was. he jury founrl.001. for the whole injury, including the overlooking as well as the vibration, &c. Lord CAIrIPBELL, who intimated that the direction of the under-sheriff should have been quite the other way, said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule ni7i granted. LARRISON V. ELLIS. This was an action on a time policy, effected upon goods and merchandise, and the ship the Grand Bonny for 12 months from the date of sailing from Liverpool. The policy was in form a printed voyage policy, but was altered so as to be adapted as a time policy to the African trade, for vhich the vessel was intended. lt contained this memorandum, " With liberty to lord, reload, exchange, sell, or barter, all or either of the goods or property on the Coast of Africa, or Afric^n Islands, and with any vessels, boats, factories, and canoes; and to transfer interest from the vessel to any other vessel, or from any other vessel to this vessel, in port and atsea, and at any ports or places she may call at or proceed to. without being doemed a deviation." The ship sailed for Benin, on the coast of Africa, anad landed a quantity of gunpowder and other goods there. The goods were deposited in a factory and bartered against 470 tons of palm oil, which was about to be put on board the Grand Bonny. The faotory consisted in part of the hull of an old ship, and it apad that one of the native Kings, carelessly taking a lighted candle down into the hold, set fire to the whole place. The gunpowder blew up, and the natives attacked and plundered the frctory, and thus the plaitiff's cods, consisting of the palm oil for which the gunpowder had been bartered, were destroyed or plundered. The question now raised, on a rule to enter a verdict for the plaintiff, was whether tho goods in question were covered by the policy. Mr. KNdOWyLES, Q.C., Mr. J. WILDE, Q.C., and Mr. BLACBURN showed cause against the rule, and contended that the verdict had been properly entered for the defendant. Sir F. KELLY, Mr. E. HILL, and Mr. AsPLAND appeared in support of the rule, and contended thatthe goods bartered for, though still lying in the factory, were covered by the policy, the intention of the additional memorandum being to provid asecurity for goods so circumstanced. L,ord CAMPBELL said he thought the verdiet had been very properly entered for the defendant, and it ought not to be disturbed. The actiou was on a marine policy-a time policy for a marine adventure, and unless there was soame special clause in the policy which overrode the printed form, although it was ea time policy, the underwriter would not be liable. The claim made was in respect of 470 tons of oil, bartered for the gunpowder which had been sent by the Grand Bonny, and which had not yet been put on board the ship. It was clear that the underwriter was not liable, unless there weere some special words which made him liable for the loss which tookplace on land. It had been suggested by Mr. Justice Crompton, who was well aquainted with the nature of these contracts in connexion with the Africa trade, that the object of the memorandum was to prevent the objection which might have been made to the shP being used as a warehouse on the coast of Africa. He (Lord Campbell) was at a loss to know how, according to grammatical construction, or any probable conjecture, the memorrndum could have been intended to make the underwriter liable for goods when safely landed, or for goods intended to be put on board. It merely gave a liberty to do certain things, without its being considered a "deviation." His Lordship thought there was nothing to extend the underwriter's liability to what might be termed a terrene risk. The contrary construction would extend the liability of the underwriter, and make himr liable for a double cargo. Mr. Justice ERELS and Mr. Justice CROMPTON were of the same opinion. Judgment for the defendant.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WSTmxNTS, AiPmL 20. trounrys rn Baanco.-iaswer Term.-Before Lord Chief Jus- tire COCKBURN and JUsIieM CRESsVELT, CROWDER, and WILLES.) This was special daper day, and the Court was occupied with arguments on aemurrers. GOODMAI V. SPENCER. This was an action for damages for not definitely proving some gm-barrels of the plaintiff under the Gun-barrel Proof Act of 1855. The defendants by their plea set out facts denying their liability, and to this plea there wvas a demurrer. Mr. Mellor, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Field), appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Byles (with whom was Mr. T. .ones) for the defendant. It appeared that under the statute two moZles of proof are rpuired for gun-barrels of a certain description,-viz., for re baTeels and for double barrels. The first proof, when the barrel is in the rough, is called "provsional proof "` the second proof, when the barrel is finished and lighter, is not so severe, and is called " definitive proof." Tis statute applies to both the Birmingham (unmakers' Company and the London Gunmakers' Comry, and prohibits the sale or ex rtation of all gun- arrels ot bering the proof marks o one or other ofthes companies. For some reason the " definitive proof' mark of the London Gunmakers' Company appears to be of greater trade value, and the plaintiff, having provisionally proved certain gun-barrels requiring that proof at the 3Birminghamn Proof-house, sent the barrels after they -were finished for definitive proof to the London Proof-house, and the defendant, as the representative of that house, refused to prove them, because they had not been proisonally proved in London. For the plaintiff it was contended that the defendant was bound under the statute to prove thera and affix the London proof mark. Foi the defendant it was contended there was no such o,-gation, and that this I endorsement of the Birmingh*m proof by the London Proof-house would be deceiving the public. The LORD CHIEF JUSTIC1B, m delivering jndgment, said he was of opinion that the plea, was good, and that there mtt be judgrment for the defendant. It was clear that the statute intended, as to some clases of guns, thattheyshould be provisionally proved in their unfinished state, and aifterwards definitively proved ia their finished state, and that neither of the companies were bound to affix the mark of definitive oof, unless the barrels had been provisionaUy proved. 'lNo question raised was whether, where one company bad provisionally proved gun barrels, the other company would be bound to receive them in their finished state, and, after proving them, to affix the mark showing definitive proof. He thought there was nothing in the act to make it iucumbent on either company to do so. Previously to this act the two companies had an entirely separate and independent existence. There was nothing in the act to show that the two companies were amalgamated into one; and even if they wereitwasaquestionfortheLsgis. lature whether either company was to be hound to affix the mark of definitive proof without having previously affixed the provisonal proof mark. There was nothing in the Act to show that this wss obligatory, and if intended it might easily have been done. Bection 15 saved the rights of the London Gun Company. In the absence of .anything inthe Act to make it incumbent on one company to give credit to the mark of the other there must be judgment for the defetdant. The other learned JuncGxs concurred.

In the early part of the latter month he went over to Hamburg to dispose of some coats, having previously promised Mr. Plant tlat he would pay the rent then due in advance (8. 15s.) on his return. When, however, he came back to England he found that everything he had left in the house had been oleared off by the defendant Hanson, acting upon a distress warrant from the defendant Plaut. None of the property had been returned to the plaintiff, and a Mr. Goldberg, who had been left in chargeof the house, said that he had seen one of the defendants weayng Mr. Stern's slippers. In the course of the speech of the learned counsel for the defence, Mr. Justice Wn. s said that there could be no valid answer to the plaintiff's case if his witesses were to be believed, and that it was a mere question of damages. A long conference then ensued between counsel on each side and their clients at the termination of which, hIr. MLcoLM said that 21r. Plant inisted upon the cause going on. He was therefore sworn; and, after hearing his evidence and the smmming up of the learned judge, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff,-damages. 100Z.; and, in answer to a question put by Mr. Justice Williams, said that they were of opinion that Plant authorized Hanson's proceedings.
COURT OF EXCEQUER. MoDAY. APRz. 9f CRiSP V. GILT. (Sitting in Banco.1 Mr. SLZAfD moved for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection. It appeared at the trial before the Lord Chief Baron, at the Middlesex sittings, that tho plaintiff was a butcher in Bath, and that this was an action ainst Sir Robert Gill for slanderous words spoken to the plaintiff in the presence of third parties, imputing to him that he had dishonestly substituted tough mutton for some lamb which he (the defendant) had bought the day before. The defendant pleaded not guilty and a justification, but at the trial the plaintiff disproved the latter ?lea, by showing conclusvely that no change had taken piace, and that the joints bought by the defendant had been faithfully delivered to him. The case then rested on the plea of not guilty only, and on this issue it was suggested that the Chief Baon had misdirected the jury in telling them that the complaint of the defendant was one which he had a right to make if he did so bon4d fd, though mistaken, and that in the absence of the proof of malice the defendant was entitled to the verdict. It was now contended that the words being actionable by reason of their having been spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his trade, and in the presence of third parties, the law implied malice, and it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to give evidence upon that subject. The COURT, however, held that the question had been rightly put to the jury by the learned Chief Baron as a privileged communication. A customer, believing that a tradesman bad net delivered goods which had been bought aud paid for, but had substituted others of a defective qjuality, had a perfcot right to make complaint of the fact to the tradesman, even in the presence of third Darties, and unless he was shown to be actuated by malice he was not liable to any such action as this.-Rule refused. POSTER V. PRITCEARD. This was an action of trespass agaiust the High Bailff of the Southwark County Court, in which the plaintiff had xecovered 15L damages. Mr. HAirTxi now moved to stay the proceedings and aio to enter a suggestion to deprive the plaintiff of costs. It appeared that the action arose out of a mistake nmade by the defendant in tak5g the goods of the plaintiff in execution under the process of the County Court against another party. An interpleader summons was heard by the judge, whe decided in favour of the plaintiff; but no mention was made of any claim for the trespass which formed the subject of the present action. It was now contended that, as the matter might have been there decided, the present action The C()RT, however, held that, as the matters haLd not been brought before the judge, it was competent to the paintiff to sue. They therefore refused to grant the rule on this point; but on the second ground they granted It as prayed for.-Rule nisi accordingly. (Sittings at NiW Prius, before Mr. Baroo WATSON and COmmon Jurie.) There were only two causes in the list this morning, and those were not of sufficient interest to justify a report. This Court will sit on Wednesday next in London.
ARCBIS' COURT. MONDAY. A )n 9f DENISON V. DITCE[1.B (Beforc Sir J. Dol9sox.1 This was the day appointed for the commencement of the arguments in the cause of "Derison v. Ditoher;" but, notwithstanding the notices of it which have appeared in the public press, so little interest did the public appear to take in the subject that on the cause being called on there were scarcely a dozen persons present exceptthoso connected with the suit. The case is very complicated, but the following brief outlineof facts may tend to elucidate it:- Complaiunt having been made by the Rev. J. Ditcher, clerk, vicar of South Brent, in tho county of Somerset and diocess of Bath and Wells, to the Archbishop of Canterbury of scandal and evil report existing concerning the Venerable George Anthony Denison, archdeacon of Taunton and vica of the parish of East Brent, in consequence of statements made by him in three sermons preached in the cathedral of Wells, his Grace issued a commission to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, two rural deans, and two bene. ficed clergymen-to inquire into the truth of the charges. lUnder ordinary circumstances the com. miMsion would have been issued by the bishop of the diocess, but he being patron of the preferment held by Archdeacon Denison, it was contended that under the Chwoh Discipline Act that duty devolved on the arch. bishop of the province. The Commissioners reported that there was prln4facie groand for instituting further pro. ceedings. The Bishop of Bath and Wells having been applied to, and asked to take proceedings upon the report by sending the case to the Court of Arches, and having declined to do so, articles were prepared and deposited both in London and in Well on the part of Mr. Ditcher, and the archbishop was pressed to constitute a court and to hear the case under the 3d and4th Vict., cap. 86, sec, 11. The arch. bishop declined to proceed further in the matter, upon which steps were taken in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel him to proceed. The articles were 25 in number, and, after those of the usual character, set forth the sub. stance of the 25th, 2Sth, 29th, and 35th asticles of religion of the Church of England, and alleged that the 15th homily, 2dbookentitled, "Of theWorthyReceiviag of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ," contained and set forth the true doctrinelof the Church of England respectingthatsacra. ment. It was then pleaded'that Archdeacon Denison, in three sermons or disoourses preached by him in the cathedral of WeUs, on the 7th August, 1853, on the 6th November in the same year, and on the 14th May, 1854, advisedly |affirmed doctrines directly contrary and repugnant to the before-mentioned articles of religion, or some of them; that he caused all three sernmons to be printed, and that they were published within the diocess of Bath and Wells. Copious citations from the sermons were given in the arti. des Abut, as they were not referred to in the judgment, it Is unnecessary to set them forth. The remainder of the articles w ere principally formal, and concluded by praying that right and justice might be effectually done. The cause came on for hearing before the Court of Bath and Wells in August last, which was presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assited by Dr. Lushington, Dr. Z. S. Johnson, dean of the cathedral chunrch of Wells, and Dr. Ieurtley, Margaret Professor of Theology in the University of Oxford. The Court came to the conclusion, as stated in its declaration of the 12th of August last, that the I doctrines maintained in the following passagee contained in the sermons of the ven. archdeacon,-namely, I" That the body and blood of Christ being really present after an ihnmaterisa and spiritual manner in the consecrated bread and wine are therein and thereby given to all and are received by all who come to the Lord's table;" and " That to al who come to the Lord's table, to those who eat and drink worthily, and to those who eat and drink unworthily, the body and blood of ChriAt are given; andthat by all who eome to the Lord's table, by those who eat and drink wor- thily, and by those who eat and drink unworthily, the body and blood of Christ are received ' and "It is true that worship is duo to the real though invisible and aupernatunl presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Holy Eiacharistunder the form of bread and wine,"-were directly contra and repugnant to the 28th and 29th of the articles of religion mentioned in the hbatnte of the 13tb Eliz., cap. 12. Time was allowed to the archdeaoorn to revoke his error, in response to which he filed a pper at Wells, which not being deemed satisfactory by the Court a sentence of deprivation was passed on the 22d of October last, against which the present appeal was instituted. The ADMnuLii ADVO0ATE (with whom was Dr. Deane) appeared on behalf of the Archdeacon of Taunton, and submitted that, although the learned counsel for Mr. Ditcher were in strict practice entitled first to address the Court, yet that was a most inconvenient mode of-proceed;ing. Dr.oBfrPonD, on the part of Mr. Ditcber, had not the least objection to his learned friend open'ag the case. The ADMIRALTY ADVioCaT said that a protest had in the first instance been given in by Archdeacon Denison, in which he alleged, under five heads, that the proceedings taken by Mr. Ditcher were null and void. It was desirable to consider that protest before entering into the rnerits of the case. If the Court upheld any of these grounds of protest, that would at once put an end to the suit. Dr. BAYrORD contended that the case ought to be taken as a wbole, snd not in part, otherwise there would be several ditnct judgments, the consequence of which would be to prolong the arguments indefinitely. The learned JUDGnu said that if there was any one objection contained in the protest.which went to the root of the whole case he apprehended that he was at liberty to hear counsel upon it in the first instsnce, because it might decide the whole question. The ADuALT ADvoctrx said that by the 3d and 4th of Victoria, ca. 86, sec. 20, it was enacted,-" That every suit or proceeding against any clerk in holy orders for any offence against the laws ecclesiastical shall be commenced within two :years after the commission of the offenoe, in respect of which the suit or roceeding shall be instituted, and not afterwards,' &c. There were both affirmative and negative words in the statute. The Court below held that the tbird sermon preached by the archdeacon was not proved to have been published in the diocess of Bath and Wells; therefore the articles relatin to it might be regarded as struck out. The date of the fist offence charged was the 7th of August, 1853, and the second was on the 6th of NQovember, in the same year. When application was made to the former and the present Bishop of Bath and Wells to take proceedings against the archdeacon, although they did not approve his sentiments, yet they considered that he was permitted to hold them, because they had not bean ceUnsured by the Church. After that Mr. Ditcler made application to the archbishop of Canterbury on the 20th of October 1854; the commission issua on the 30th of iovember; the commissioners met on the 3d of January, 1855, and mnade their report on the 10th of the same mnonth. Articles were served on the archdeacon on the 4th of August, and citation issued calling upon him to appear before the Archbishop of Canter. bury, at Doctors'.commons on the 5th of May, 1856. The archdeacon appeared on the 27th of May, hut there was no court held, and he was then entitled to be dismissed. A ciation was extracted on the 5th of June, and served on the 10th, calling .upon him to appear at Wells. The question was whether the commencement o the proceedings spok-en of iln the 20th section of the Act was the Cdtaon to appear at Wells, served on the 10th of Jnae. He (the Admiralty Advocate) contended that the commencement of the proceedings was the citation to appear at Wells. Wherever there was a reasonable doubt as to the construction of a crnal statute it fas the duty of the Court to construe it in favour of the criminaL. It remained for the Court at Bath to lay down a rule on this question more wrorthy of the Star Chamber thana* modern court of justice. Where a statute was silent wvhich effected a change in the lawF as to other parts of the law, the proper construction was that it dd not intend to effect a change, except where it was absolutely necessary for the execution of the Act or where it arose by necessary implication (Bacon's Abr,i men;, vol 7, page 456). Where the Church Discipline Act did not express any alteration of the law the old law must be regarded as binding. The question as to the commencement of a suit underwent themost graveconsiderationitcould zeceive in the case of "Sherwvood v. Ray" (I Moore, P. . C.), where it was held that the commencement of the suit was theservlce of the citation. The same doctrine bad beeni laid down in " Brooks v. Creswell" (1 Robertson, 606), and " The Bishop of Hereford v. Thompson" (17 Juris, 190). The archdeacon was not obliged to appear before the commissioners, and at the Court of Bath there was a regular citation, having all the ingredients which made it the commencemient of the sait. He contended first, that on a due construction of the Act of Parliament, explained by its own languaage; secondly, upon the princple of the constraction of all statutes;* thirdly, inre especialy upon the rinciple of the constructionof criminal stattes; and, fonrthly, upon the direct precedents in this case, the old law whichn rled w.hat should and shonld not be the commencement of a sait was in foree, and that law spoke in a langua'e not to be mistaken that the citation to appar before theCourtof Bath was the commencement of th suit. If that poeition was eorrect the citation was more than two years after the last specified and proved offence. Dr. DBAN3x followed on the same side. Dr. BAYEonD said there were three dates which seemed to him most important. The first sermon was preached on the 7th of August, 1853. He would take that as the most difficult date, and contend that the uroceedings commenced within two years from that time. the notice of the archbishop as to his intention to hold the commission was served on the archdeacon on the 8d of November, 1354, and he contended that that notice was the eommneuement of thepresentproceedings. Thereport of the commissioners was dated on the 10th of January, 1855, after which articles were drawn up, signed by an advocate, and deposited at Wells on the 4th of August, 1855, a copy of which was served on the archdeacon on the sme day; consequently three days under the two years. His learned friends had attempted to apply the technical rules applicable to citations to a document which they did not venture to call a citation, but which was a mere notice or requistion to appear before the Court of Bath. (t referred to articles which had been drawn nD, and contained no charge whatever. If it meant anything, it meant that the articles were the itation. According to the terms of the Act of Parliament there was an inquiry to be prosecuted, and the issuing of the commission was the commencement of the proceedings. The subsequent steps taken were what the Act called "further proceedings." If the case was ultimately decided by the bishop himself the proceedings were the same, but if the case was brought before the Court of Arches it was a enw suit, and fresh charges might be introduced. The cases quoted on the other side came to the Court of Arches by letters of request, and the Court knew nothing of them except from what there appeared. The only instance in which the Act used the words " commencement of proceedings" was in the 4th section, where it referred to the proceedings before the commissioners, The argunent was adjourned until to-morrow.
COOURT OF BANKRUPTOY, Basingh -stree, April 20. IN RE J. B. WAVELL. (Before Mr. CommToncr GouiBtmLN.) There was a choice of assignees in the case of J. B. Wavell, bilibroker, of Adams-court, old Broad-street, Mrx. ClildIcy appearing for the bankrupt, and Mr. Stubbs for the petitioninig creditor. The bankrupt is the party who was summoned by the parish authornties for neglecting to maintain his wife and three children, he being living at the time with a Miss Collins. An anr altercation now ensued between the deserted wife, a ladylike person, and another lady, understood to be her sister, and who evidently took part with the bankrupt. Interference was necessary on the part of the messenger of the Court, or a fierce combat might have rzesulted with other weapons than that "unruly member"the tongue. M1r. CHRiDLLr applied for the bankrupt's discharge froma prison. He had been in custody eight months. Mr. Bs4 roN op osod. His client had intrusted the bankirpt with a bill of exchange to get discounted. He had got back neither the money for the bill nor the bill itself, although he had incurred costs to the amount of 401. The bankrupt explained that he took the bi31 for discount to Messrs. lemp and Clay, who having suspended payment The Co~mussronnu said it was a case of fraud. The banlrupt, however, having been eight months in custody he would suggest that the opposition should for the present be withdrawn. The opposing creditor might hereafter have an opportunity of arresting the bankrupt. Mr. B.Rnoi adopted the suggestion, and the discharge husband absionded with tRhis bill hedeserte9td m te.txem The CcOiSSIONER declined to hear Mrrs. WavelL. It was stated that on leaving court the bankrupt would encounter a polie- constable armed with a w arant The debts of the bankrnpt are 2,7001p- his assets nominal. Assignees were chosen.
INSOLVEiNT DEBTORS COURT, Apri 20. 1T RE: DNCAN WATRIN (Before Mr. Commnissioner PIELLIPS) This insolvent, who had kept a coffeehouse at Plaistow, petitioned under the Protection Act. He was opposed by ATr. Sargood for three creditors who had dene work for hun in the erection of some house They alleged that the insolvent represented he was possessed of some hundreds of pounds, the savings of his pay while in the Crimea5 where he been a foreman of navvies. The insolvent flatly denied the evidence of the creditors, and swore he had never made any such reoresentation as they attributed to hinm. Another ground of complaint was, that having received some bricks from a creditor for the purposes of Ins building speculation, he sold them again, and applied the proceeds to the paymenat of some old debts. Mr. Commissioner PHu'us said he could not adopt the insolvent's aeertion that the three creditors who opposed him were all perjured; and therefore, under any circum. stances, protection would not have been granted for some time to come. However, the transaction as to the disposal of the bricks ws of such a nature that the petition could not be allowed to remain. Petition dismiQsed.
POLIOE. MAKNSION-HOUSMX. D. W. Harvey, the Commissioner of Police, and mr. J. Macgregor and Mr. M. Ware, two members of the Committee of the Ragged School Shoe, black Society, attended at the Justice-room. Mr. Harvey, addressing the Lord Mayor, said,-It hwa be-enfrequently reprerented to the presiding magistrate in this court that the police interfere with the bo7s who are endeavonring to earn, as it is atWed, an honest hvliihoo by cleaning the shoes of those who apply to them, such boys not belonging to the society kisown as the Boys Shoebljk Society. In order that the publiec ay understand the principle upon which both this society and the police act in reference to these boy, it is necessry that heir minds should be disabused and that they should understand how utterly Impraticable it is to Puue the course that hs been suggested-namely, of alowing every boy to obtain an honest liveihood without the Atrventio of the polioejwherea we wish t4 represent to your Lordship that umles these boys submit to gorertnlent and are under those rsn-. lations which the gentlemen twho ae here represeatngX the society feel neceuar7, tho result must be that they mo be all forbidden, because, if it Ia once understood that an boy himelf where he pleae in the elty with V. box nd6rushes, :pressing to clean the shoes of Passers-by tho inconvenience will become altozether intolerable; while' on the other hand, if boys ave their allotted localities Ana submit to wholesome regulations it Is a great advantg to them, and not less to the pablic. I now introduce gentle. men, who most disinterestedly take upon themselves the task of conducting this society, who will detail how it Pen-able that either the whole system should be abolished or that it must be subject to some wholesome regulation. Mr. Macgregor.-My Lord Mayor, I am here with my friend, as members of the Ragged School Society, to explain the matter mentioned by the Police Commissioner. There are two sorts of shoeblacks-those who are under regulation and those who are free to do as they please. The boys who are under system belong to four societies, all of which are managed in the same way by gentlemen connected with the Ragged SchooL The boys are selected for good conduct from the Bagged I School, they ae under a regular sstem of discipline and control, they come at fixed hours, they go to fixed places, they go in fixed numbers, and they have a fixed rate of payment, proportioned to their earnings. A regular Eystem of discipne, and of promotion, reward, and punishment, is established, and their religious and intellecbual education,as well as their advancement in life and their preparation for emigration, is attended to. This costs a considerable del of trouble, but I am happy to say that, although vory expen. sive, the whole expnses from one end to the other are in the oldest of the four oieties entirely borne by the boys, and this is the first instance of a self.supporting reformatory institution in the world. The other boys seen in thestreets earning money bysboeblacldng are wholly without control; they leave at such times as they please, in sich numrbers V they please, and for such purposes asthey plfte& No person IS responsble for their conduct, nd the question is whether the boys shalbe wholly left without control, or wbetherthe discipline that is now extended to those in the Shoeblck Society shall be such a wrarrant to the putblic for their good management as would justify the publo in eormitting to the police that exercise of their discretion which is alreedy vested in other csees in the streets. Thearningacramount of money taken by the Shoeblack Society have been about 2,5001. during the past year, and I have not the slightest doubt that at least 10,0001. a-year ought to be earned by romebody or other upon this system of shoeblacking. To allow these boys, who are without control, to have perfect liberty to go and move in any number and at 'ny time they please would be both injurious to them and inconvenient to the public. By allowing them to act by regulation a very wholesome occupation would be encouraged. it would be extremely inconvenient to the public that the boys should be rllowed for another summer not only to ran about the streats, but to fix down their boxes where they please, 10 or 12 round a favourite station, where we are only allowed to place one boy. Cert_nl,y, we think some arrangement ought to be made by which the boys who do not belong to the society should not become an annoyance to the public. The LOBnD MYYOB.-Iam gld that the commissioner has come to see me upon this subject, because, like mxny others, I ha-e felt the great evil likely to arise from what we wish to be a great advantage to the public. I at one time thonght that one boy had as much right to stand in the street and black shoes as another. During the last two or three montbs I have been watching, and have paid great attention to these boys, and I believe that the pretence of blacking shoes has been made the means of oongregating pickpockets and thieves, whose system is almost as well organized as that of the Shoeblack Society. Certainly the boys belonging to the society do conduct themselves most properly, and since I have occupied this chair not a single oharge hasbeen brought against them. If after this the commissioner complains to me of annoyance to the public occasioned by boys who are not under the control and government of the society I shall immediately endeavour to put a stop to i. I do not hesitate to say that I should feel myself perfectly justified in punishing any bos who obstruct the public streets by blacking the shoes of passers.by unless they are under Proper controL Mr. Harvey.-While mslstrates are very desirous of protecting the ociety, it is equall7important that the public should have the full henefit of its existence, and one of the chlef complaints is, that there is alarge period of the day when the boys belonglng to the society retire, and when the ground becomes vacant. It is thought that then other boys might fairly be allowed to oocupy that ground. I have suggested to the gentlemen of the society that they ought either to extend the period at which their boys shall attend or that they should put on relays of other boys,, otherwise it is scarcely just that their places should not De allowed to be occupied, Mr. Ware-At the present season of the year our time for removingthe boys b 6 o'clock, but in consequence of a suggestion made by the commissioner a few days ago we have organized a separto division, who go to the stations afterthathour ancdremaintillitisquitedark. Where any boys of the opposition, who are now working on their own account, are well.conducted and wdll- dsed, if they will onl gets recommendation from anyof the Ragged Schools in london we are always willing to employ them. Some of ourbest boys are those who have been in the streets, but who have come to us and requested us to take them, and we have done no. At present there are about 40 boys inthe blue, between 30 and 40 in the yellow, and 75 to So inthe orignal society, making altogether about 150 The LowD M.YOR.-If you were to form a brigade for sweeping crossangs as well as for blacldna shoes I believe you might employ about a thousnd boys in the metropolis and I am sure that passengers would willigly give them a halfpemnny or peny for their labour. Unfortunately, the present crossing-sweepers are a very disreputable claws, and on a dirty day, as soon as they have got a pocketful of halfpence, they leave their station, and not unfrequently spend their earnings in drink. Mr. Ware.-By the end of this week I believe that a plan similar to that suggested by yonr Lordship wMi be tried in Southwark, when about 20 boys will be employed The commissioner and the deputation thaiked the Lord Mayor for the attention with which he had lisened to their remarks, and withdrew. Bow-SrXX rT.-Jamcs Black was charged with burglary. The prisoner was stopped at about 2 o'clock yesterday morning, in Charles8street,Drury.-ane, byPolioemanBuckingham, of the F division. He had in his possession a large bundle, of which he could give no satisfactory account, and the constable took him into custody on suspicion. The bundle was found to consist of two shawls and two dree?s w rzapped up in a silk handkerchief. On inquiry it was found that the house of a poor widow named Welch, a laundress in Henry-street, St. John's-wood, had bzen broken into, and the articles in question stolen. The pri soner mnst have conveyed them through the streets from St. John's-wood to Drury-lane without interruption from the olice The articles were valued at 3. He was committed for trhiL A bald-headed old man, with large white moustaches and whiskers, who said his name was John William MVDonald, was brought before Mr. HAL4, charged with indecently exposing himself to two little girls in the sculpture-room at the Bzitish Museum. The prisoner denied the charge. He stated that he had been in business at Liverpool, but had retired and was now residing in town. He declined to state his address. MIr. HALL convicted the prisoner, and sentenced him to three months' imprisonment with hard labour. MARLBOPOUGH.SThR=T.-Wjllim Weber, a German baker, was charged before Mr. BX&DON with violently assaulting Robert Wallachi, by stabbing him with a knife. The prosecutor, whose evidence was interpreted to the Court through the medium of Mr. Albert, stated that he is a baker, and that on Saturday evening last he was at a house of call for bakers in Windmill-street, when he had occasion to leave the club-room to go into an adjoining room, where he saw the prisoner and another man. The latter began taunting witness, and asked him the reason he was ejected from the club-room, and dared him to go there again. A dispute then ensued between them,inwhichtheprisonerjoined, and taxed himwithhai -struck him (prisoner) s'omeewdays previously. High wed then took place, and the prisoner all at once rushed upon the prosecutor and struck him a heavy blow on the forehead with some sbarn instrument, and out through his cap. He then observed that the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and that the blood was streaming down his (prosecutor's) face. Witness directly after becwme unconscious, and was conveyed to the hospital, where his head was dressed. The wound inflcted was about two inches long, and extended across the left temple. Witness added that the prisoner assaulted him in a simiLar maer about three months ago. The prisoner, in defence, denied using a knife, and sa^id he struck the complainant in self-defence Mr. BBADoN strongly condemned the prisoner's violence, and fined him 51., or three months' imprisonment, WORSHP-STRXET. -William Woodie, a surly-looking youth of 19, son of a coachmnaker, was charged before mr.

Davidge, a constable of the G division, sid,-While on duty in the Curtain-road yesterday afternoon a lad ran u and told me I wras wanted at an ea ting-house in New-innyard, and on going there I found outside waitingf for me the pnrisoner's father, who told me that his son. who v, asthe vside, hab struck him, and that he was obliged to give him into custody, aS he could do nothing with him. I and the father went in, and there saw the prisoner, who instantly turned upon his father and struck him. I took him out as far as the door, but he there beame outrspously violent, flung himself upon the ground and so resisted that I was obliged to hold him down, and in doing that he bit me in the thumb. The father asked me to let him alone for a time til Ihis temper cooled, and I did so, and afterwards went in to tak-e him. The prisoner was now standing in s rather dark corner, and as I was trying to lay hold of him be first strack me in the face, then on the shoulder; in fast, he struck me repeatedly, and I then found that he had a tableknife in each hand. I struck the prisoner two or three times on his ams with my staff, andhe then threw the knives down, saying he would go cuietly, aud he did so. I have several cuts in my face; the prncipal one bled very mauch, but my coat protected me from the blow on my shoulder. The prisoner's father, a very respectable-looking man,wlo was deeply affected while giving his evidence, said,- rho prisoner has been a very gret trouble to me for a long time past, and is of a most dreadful And pmsionato temper.

Tng COulicH OF SCOn&ND AND WrTCCRAT.- In "a copious and comprehensive Summary of the Laws and eguations ot tho Church of Scotland," published in 1852, we find the following in the Third Book of Discipline, relative to "Witches and Charmers "-" Our General Assembly, July 29, 1640, ordains all ministars carefull- to take notice of charmers, witches, and all such abusers of the people, and to urge the Acts of Parliament to be executed agamst them." A Government commision ha i been appointed to try witches, the assembly laid do4ithe fol. lowing as sufficient to infer gauilt-" Paction to serve the devil is certainly per sc relevant without any addition, provided they acknowledge they knew him io be the devil this paction Is either expressly performed by * formal promise given to him, then present, to serve him; or by presenting a supplication to him, or by giving the promise to a proxy empowrered by the devil for that effect, which he iniusgeth to some who dare not see himself." " Renouncing baptism is most relevant per K to infer the crime of witchcrat. Witchess used to confess that in s doing they use this solemnity, by putting one of their hands on the crown of their head and the other beneath the sole of their foot, at which time he gives them new names." Agin,-" Witches de likewise torment mankind by maldng images of clay or wax, and when they prick them the persons do find extreme torment, which dot not proceed from any influence those Images have upon the body tormested, but the devil drth by natural means raise these torments in the person at the very same time that the witches do prick, or pounce, or hold to the fire these images Witches confessin- this manner of torment may very judicialy ba found gui!ty, since, consat de corpore aelicti demodo ddinquendi et inimic.tiisprevis,the punishment of this crime is with us death, and the doom ordinarily is to be worried at the stake and burnt." It is not surprising thAt under the frantic inspiration of these laws many unha py creatures in Scotland were, during the years of the witchcraft mania, burnt in her principal cities; but it is surprising that a book like this should be pushed into general use at the present day by being published at a cheap rate, and sanctioned by the nighest authorities in the church. A correspondent referring to the recent remarks on witchcraf which appeared In She Times, says :-"In Scotland the belief in witchcraft is very generaL In every parish there is one or more persons who are known as witch doctors, although their services are only called for by stealth ; and at all the seanort towns the fishermen are found to be highly superstiiious. The horseshoe is very commonly nailed to the stern or sternpost of the boat, and no fisherman will use a boat again which had been upset and the crew drowned. In some of the cities there are many fortunetellers, and in one case a lady of rank was known to consult a miserable old hag as to a family difficulty while her footman waited for her at the door." It would be well, we think, if these obs.- lete laws were repealed by the General Assembly, for certainly so long as they stand as part of her discipline the church of Scotland need not wonder that ignorance and suetrstition should sfill abound among her parishioners. EBoRDINA2y AUTo-DA-FE-_A body of itinerant Capuchin monks lately invaded the town of Grasse, in the department of the Var, and there enacted A scene which will scarcely be credited as baving occurred in France in the 19th century, although if the venue were laid in the States of the Churchor in Spain there would be nothing surprising inthe story. After a preachment of more sermons than were ever heard at a Scotch "H oly Fair," a sturdy orator one Father Archange, mounted the pulpit and pronouncei a furious discourse against philosophers and romance writers. Not only Alexander Danas, Eug6ne Sue, Georges Sand, and Balzac, but even MM. Thiers and Lamartine were denounced by name. Among newspapers the D66ats and SiWcZc were stigmatized as unfit for Christian reading. At the conclusion of a fierce invective the monk called upon his hearers, as they valued their eternal salvation, to deliver up to the parish priest within 24 hours, all books, pamphlets, journalst and printed papers whatsoever not approved by the bishop which might be in their possession. Pursuant to this mandate a lare pro rtion of the population of the town came by night to the church-door, and there, through an aperture provided by the curd, they furtvelythrew down their sinful literature as an unfortunate mother deposits her offspring in tbeboxofafoundlinghoepitil. The nextday,whichhappened to be Holy Thursday, a grand atodoa.f6 was celebrated rn one of the public places of the town. The devoted booksandnewspapers were packed upon a large funereal pile. Two copies of Lamartines JTocelyn, one of La COhute c'un Ance, a complete set of M. Thiers'Hisiory of the FrcnhcsRoluti.n, very many volumes of Balzac, Dumas, and Eugene Sue, a dopy of M Senator Merim6e's Colomba, I. Michelet's works, and Jules Simon's R.igiox Natureae, were remarked among the collection, which comprised an immense number of plays, vaudevilles, and illustrated publicatiocs. At 9 in the evening, all being prepared, the clergy, preceded by two infant choristers, each bearing a silver crow covered with a black veil advaneed in procesion to the place of execution. Some "i ad bookcs," which had been brought in at the last moment, were carried by beadles in baskets hung with blck. The corege rnarched slowly and silently, lighted by torch" and wax candle& The beadles having emptied their bekets into the oondemned mass of books and papers, the holy fathers immediately et fre to the fagots, and asthe fBames burnt up high the cur6 chanted Parce Domine. The majority of the spectators were utterly inorant of the nature of the entertaisnme and would probably bave thought ita better show had the Capuchins beenborut instead of thebooksi Some fewr ade fun of the proceedings, and put humoorous qnuaionc to thJe priest as they paed. by. There cnnot be the betst doibt that priests of this kIdney onl] want the powrto bura I*mcaxtine, Tlhiers, Doms, JlBehelet, &c., inaed of their books.-Z{xprcss.
PHILHThBUBc,ro COYCEBTS& About this time last nur grave aXtLcipations were enter. tUaed with regard i,* the jftsa prospeots of the Philbarmonio Society. T n:m Iddentr df 1855 had dealt it a severe blow, and the -ar 5 of eigfs-class orchestral music, who 'vdthout the '.' kifmarmoaie" would be deprived of theit hif solace, ad recreatioL in the summer seaon, began to hbzbour 'eag cf an approaching dissolution. Such a cataztropb'4 woald indeed have been a pity, for with all its trz,rs'-it mritakes if polioy, frequent smanagement, Vast-worsiipping syRrit, and obstinate one-sidednessthe Philharmonic Soiety has accomplished too much -reel good for art nut to atitle it, in a very strong degree, to the sympathies of ak who wish to see music loeish at a hheathy tate prolominato. The almost saicidal act wioh the dirctors ccnmitted the year before lalt (after Mr Costa's unexpebted secessios) -of throwing thomselver into t;erms of "'Itie new school'-aS -it ins been denounaated, althoagh -edLy not a scheol atv-0, since it msskes-nowccount of *ose 3g%t and imraataol3o priociples without whioh art must perish-led to such disastrass results that it 'required a very &rui}l practitioner to restore the inftitdtitE to its pristine health -d Tigeur. B:apSplly, nsa a practitioner was at harde; and this timp; 'eitherkaght by experience or .painfd1ly 'anxious for the 'luture, the directors addressed thereselves to the proper quartsn. In offering the poest of conductor to Professor, Sterxl?Ale Bennett they-selected procisely tie man who, fronitidistinguihod-ttainments and iniversal popularity, wae in every respeotthe most 'likely to answer tho purpose for','hich his servimss were-required. 'In onse season Herr Wagner contrived, per foree of eccentric mangsment, to disorganize a band *hich, under the superintendence of Mr. 'Costa, had -been umaniumously recognized as one of the -finest in Europe. In -e season, by the aid of judicious disoipline, united to a .nethodof conducting clear, *intelligible, and wholly devoid 'ef superfluous display, Professor Bennett managed to reor,anize and bring bark 'the Thilharmonic orchestn in a very great meare to what-it had been previous to the ad. vent of his immediate predecessor. A, comparison between the plain, unaffected, and'traly -msici style in vtieh the symphonies and -overtures were read last -night, end the inflated exaggeAation that distinguished almost every performance under the Wsgneriasrrbatx, t must havo convinced aD1 who were competent to judge that the disinclination to sanction such rhodomontade in England was-merely an evidence of that plain common sense which ordinarily distingiuhes our countrymen, in musical as in other mattes. In the present instance, instead of the composers being made a sort of vehicle for the exhibition of the chef ''orchkstre and his peculiaritiec, the- chef -d?orwhestre simply considered it his duty to see the music performed according to the text, and made no attempt whateverat display -on his own account-for wkich he deserves the thanks of subsoribers, who -come to hear the eymphonies, and not to look at the conductor. The eelection was a fine one, and effectively varied, as the following-programme will show:- PASRT L sinfonia in E;lat, No. 8 .j . . .. aydn. Aria (Jeeswnda), Siigner Beetti . . Opohr. concerto in 3 m1inor, Pianoforte, mis Asr- bella Goddard .Mendecohn. Aris, Madame lIudredorf. (Oberon) . Weber. Overture (Lryanthe) .. .. Weber.

Overture (Le Deux Jouruies) .. .. .. Cwherubini. Cenductor -Professor Sterrida1s Bennett. Everyone one was pleased to hear once more the spirited and ingeniouc symphony of " Papa Haydn," who, however his successors-Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn-may have gone beyond him, was the first inventor of that peon. liar form wiich is the very souland essence of music, and which, nevortheless, the preachers of the Zu-utnft (as Herr Wagner openly deelares -in his recent-extraordinary letter upon Dr. Liszt and his compositions) are rampant to abolish because it inconvenientlyrestrains the flights of their erratic imagination. The -eighth of the "Salamon" set, though inferior to the .10th, in the same-key, is full of beauties that must alwaye preserve it from oblivion, contains a fiuae equal to any of its composer's, and is written throughout with the ease and '2uenoy -which Haydn possessed so remarkably, and which he never demonstrated to such eminent advantage as in his instrumental compositions. It would, perhaps, have been wiser -to give one of the later symphonies of Bcthoven after this example of compari. tively primitive art; bat that is a matter of opinion. The ono performed -last night presents disparity enough to show what vast strides the art bad made since Haydn wrote fcr Mr. Salamon. Besides (familiar as ML Jullien has rendered its lengthy and melodious andemic), the entire work is not heard often just now ; and since -it has become the fashion of late to hold up the last compositions of Beethoven as models of his genius, it may not be amiss occasionally to go back to those early ani genial inspirations with which it may be said to have tried its wings. That the grand master of the orchestra himself regarded the symphony in D with particular affection may be gathered from the fact of his having made three complete scores dt it before he could be satisfied. The last was, as -Beethoven well knew, a masterpiece. The execution of 'the two symphonies under Professor Bennett's diroetion was admirable from first to lastworthy, in short, of the'PhilharmoniaBociety in its palmiest days. Both were -received with enthusiasm. The concerto of Mendelssohn was an unlooked-for treat. 'Up to the ladt moment 'it was expected that hL Charles Ha116, the great German pianist, would play the concerto of Beethoven in G. An unlucky accident, however, made it impossible for M. Hall6 to redeem his pledge; and at a few hours' nobice Miss Arabefla Goddard consented to act as his substitute. A worthier could not have been found. Very-few pianists wouLld, or could, have undertaken such a task as that df playing the most trying and difficult of concertos with scarcely any preparation; but Mis Goddard, as it has been more than once our duty to remark, appears -to have all the works of the great masters in her -head and in her fingers, ready to execute any of them at a moment's warning; and it is this which constitutes her mnost -legitimate claim to be regarded as a genuine artist. Many a vir'uoso has existed for years on the reputation obtained through the perfect execution of half-a-dozen pieces; and -how many foreign "lions" who cross the Channel to astonish the aborigines of Great Britain, hearing, upon settiDg foot on shore, that a certain leaning towards "'classical " music exists in that foggy and uncongenial region, gracefully condescend to flatter the prejudice of the inhaIsitants and edify them with successive performances of Hummel's Scptuor, the " Moonlight Sonata" of Beethoven, Mendelssohn's -first concerto, and the Cons'ert SuiiCk by Weber, which four pieces constitate their "classical" stock in trade ! Between this and being thoroughly "up" in the whole repertory of tho great masters there is a vast difference, of which our foreign 'visitors should long ago have been made aware, if only through the examnple of one of themselves-M. HaU6, to whom aU the classical music is familiar. Miss Goddard, it is unnecessary to say, is a virtuosa -of the first rank; but her fame has not been won -on the strength of playing half-a-dozea muareaeuc ecd,perpatuum. On the contrary, she has set herself the - task of mastering whatever should be known ; and thus has ,-been able to acquire a far more honourable distinction than that which belongs to the more pianist of display, wvho, -when caled upon to perform anything out of the ordinary 'routine, is at a loss, or atleast stands in need of a longa probationary intervaL Her perforrmance of Mlendelssohn's mnagnifieent concertowas admair-able-in every respect. Thereading 4"Was exactly that of the composer, and the execution irre.aroachable throughout. The first allegro was delivered, <,With -the passion and dignity which are ims poetical characterdastics, and the irresistible finak with the true Men-delssohnian vigour, playfueless, and impetuosity, and with 4he true Mendelssohitan speed into the bargain. Equal, if ,ot superior, ia attractioR to both was the exquisitely graceful and touching delisOry of the slow movement. which declared Miss Goddard a nmistress of the art, possessed syeo very few, of singing as well as pla3ying on the piano. forte, and especially delighted the conrnoisseurs, who, rg the ~l'ailharmn^nic audience, may be set down as a large majority. Her whole perform an ce created a sensation of : -a.-^e thau ordinary kind, arLd never was the unanimous zEpP=se of caFable judges mo're richly merited. Thir violonceeo,-oncertinoof Kumnmer ( "',SWn C7cnlasante"), a vo,y poor and.unmeaningly diffuse comp-.,iti.m, was miade lcepsle by ihe wonderful playing *f bignor Piatti, who ha,.; rarely wasted his fine talents ,n more tinworthy music. The twoevertures, both so dramtic rnd splendid, thongh-co utterly cpposed in style, were grandly exenuted; and had.they been Less hackneyed would have caused even a greater 4eree of enthusiasm. We should be sorry to lose either ef 4them, but we are inclined to believe that each would gain considerhLlv by being placed for a year or two on the ret4irog list. The vocal music at the Philharmonic Concerts is ssldom of mzuch accqnt, and the present occs6ion .offered no .ae-eption to the rule.

THE CA4ADI]XV SEA! OF GOVERNAEN2 UASTION. TO THE EDFITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your ramaks mApril 4) on theabove subject exhibt a sound knowldage of Canadian affairs, and from their kiberal and a,aprejtdiced tone are well calculated to give 'atisfactiot to Ail parties concerned. You have placd in a fair, open, and truthful light the claims ot the avions localities spoken of by Cauadiaxis as fit and proper £or the seat of their Govermuent, Axid, althougk I beliove you are not very far astray as regards position in yoar predilection for MfontreaL yet the" are some things whizh go to prove that Ottawa woultd be a more suitable pihee, whether viewed in reference to the present orthe'Iuture, to its geographical position or Xo the state of politibclrparties in the country. Thesmourity of the Parliatnent %wildinps, which we are eboutIto erect at enormous cost, and the preservation of the warchives of the province, are matters of primary and of imamense importanoe ia the eonstderatiem of this subjeet. And this you seem to have ?Aa stronglyin view when you Te*ted Toronto and Kingston on account of their lying in 'fit positions, exposed to attack from t1ae lake, and incapa*blo of being fortified in a maniaer to guarantee the safety -and preservation of those Jouitdings and archives in trouble,some times. But did it not occur -to you that Montreal, notwithstanding its being inland, was in no botter position. that the river St. Lawrence, a few miles above it, become,' the boundary line between the great Republic and the Canadas, and that nothing couldpo6sibly be more practicable than for an American army to drop down on its swift current into the very heart of it and lay it in ashes? Of courrse, such an army floating in the same river, 180 miles lower down, under the frowning battlements of Quebec, would meet with instant destruction; but at Montreal, where there are no heights to scale, and no commanding citadel to afford protection, the resdlts would certainly be most fatal to our interests. Now, let us glance for a moment at the position of Ottawa. It is strongly fortified by nature, and capable of being made almost as impregnable as Quebec itself. It is built on a range of ateep -conical hills, rising to a considerable height above the river, and overlooking the surrounding country to a great distance. The centre and highest of these hills, which has always been occupied as a military position, forms the proposed sito for the Parliamenthouses; and certain it is that no more beautiful spot could be found in aU British America The buildings on this hill would stand above the city, surrounded by mountains, rivers, and cataracts, in the midst of natural scenery indicative of strength, security, and greatness, and in foll view of Lower Canada. Besides, this city is situated 70 miles hack from the St. Lawrence, or nearest point of the United States; connected on the south-west with Kingston and the Great Lake by the Rideau Canal, which is 120 miles long; on the south-east with Montreal by the Ottawa River; to the north-east the Gatineau River, which pours its floods into the Ottawa (about a mile below the city), stretches more than 1,000 miles, and drains the vast unsettled regions to the rear of Montreal and Three Rivers; and to the north-west the Ottawa, (which is the grand trunk river of the Canadian interior) extends through the immense vaUey of the same name to the rear of Kingston, Toronto, and the Great Takes. These two great rivers, Ottawa and Gatineau, receiving nearly all the waters of the great countries lying to the rear of both the Cansdas, and uniting in themselves at this point-a grand network of rivers-give to Ottawa city not only the command of the great Ottawa Valley, but of an immense territory inCentralCanada, which is destined at no very distant day to contain a population of many millions, for the Ottawa River is the only great inlet, the only great gate to the interior of British America, and points like the finger of God the way the tide of population must in future flow. What place, then, -more proper for the Government or heart of the State to be located than this, where it would soon find itself in the bosom of millions, and where it could propel life and civilization through those rivers or veins to the remotest extremities of that great country ? Here the Government could best develope the resources of that great skeleton empire lying between the Atlantic and the Pacific, which I take to be one of its chief functions; and here the whole strength of the interior could be concentrated with eae in eases of emergency, and despatched with safety to Kingston and the West, viQ the PRideau Canal, andto Montreal and the East, viO the Ottawa River. Before an invading army could attack this dty. it would have on the right hand to overthrow Kingston, which guards the entrance to Rideau Canal; on the left Montreal, which guards the entrarce to the Ottawa River, or cut its way through 70 miles of hardy yeomen settled in front of it, whose veins are fill of the blood of the good old Loyalists who refused to forsake the broad banner of England when A-merica declared her independence. Agsin the Cansdas, though in fact united, are in effect separate. We have two distinct races, two distinct codes of laws, two distinct sets of institutions, and two distinct poli. tical creeds. The French, or Lower Canadians, stand up for Lower Canada, the Code Napoleon, the customs of Paris, and the right of ascendancy. The English, or Upper Canadians, for Upper Canada, the code of Blackstone, the common law of England and the right of ascendancy; consequently we find these two great parties always arrayed against and jealous of each other, and unable to agree on questions of any importance lest either should have the advantage. It was this that forced them to adopt the alternate system of removing the G4overnment every four years from one province to the other. It is this rivalry of provinces-this rivalry of races, and not a a rivalry of cities, which has induced them to submit the important question of the seat of Government to the arbitrament of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen. Let this decision, then, be in favour of Lower Canada, and you light a volcano in the heart of Upper Canada; let it be in favour of Upper Canada, and you sink a deep well of discontent in the heart of Lower Canada. But let it be in favour of Ottawa, which is on the boundary line between the two, with one-half its population French and the other Englishlet at this point where the two provinces are connected by an magnificent suspension-bridge the Parliament Houses be erected in Upper Canada, and the Governor's Palace or Government-house in Lower Canada; and you hush the voice of discontent for ever, sink all that rivalry and jea. lously between parties, and unite the two proinvces and the two races in a bond that never can be broken. It is these physical, military, central, and political advantages which have caused the nanme of Ottawa to be so favour. ably entertained, andnot the advocacy of her statesmen, who are as innocent of conceiving as they are incapable of executing any plans for making it the metropolis of British Amenica. Canadians when in difficulty have always found in you a *powerful friend and an impartial adviser. I therefore venture to hope that you will, for the benefit of Canadians in general, and in justice to theoinhabitants of Central Canada in particular, make this letter known to the world, by giving it an insertion in Your iournal.

CHURCH-BA TES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As it Is probable some measure will be brought forward in the ensuing session in reference to church-rates, I venture to offer a suggestion which, if carried into effect would, I think, allay much of the heartburning and animosity at present most unfortunately existing between the members of the established church and Nonconformists, and would at the same time be an equitable adjustment of the matter at issue in respect of all religious parties soncerned. Under the present system of church-rates sufficient moneys are raised not only for defraying the ca3ts incu red in maintaining in repair the naked fabric of the church and the buildings appertaining thereto, but also for providing certain articles incidental to and exclusively connected with the established form of worship, such as the washing of surplices, the sacramental wine, the clerk's and sexton's wages, and divers other requirements of the church; and the fact of the church-rate being saddled with these miscellaneous expenses necessitate the imposition of a rate as heavy again in amount as would be requisite if the churchrates were exclusively applicable to the repair and support of the structure of the church. The greater part of the Non-conforming community cnfess their readiness to contribute towards the mainten. anoe of the edffiee of the church as a p;rt of the property of the nation, hut most bitterly inveigh against being comelled to furnish the means for carrying out the forms of a worship to which they do not belong, in which they do not participate, and from which they have dissented. I beliave there are few Churchmen who do not more or less admit the justness of this objection. I would therefore propose that the expenditure requisite for the maintenance of Q,he actual fabric of the church and the buildings thereto belonging should, as heretofore, be .defrayed fbr a church-rate levied on the community at large, irWespective of and without seference to their religious opi=ions, but that the other miscellaneous expenses incidental to the performance of Divine worship in the church should be discharged by a paw-rate, or some other rate which would Call exclusivciy on the members of the established chucch. By these means the building of the church, as national property, w'old be maintained at the cost of tie nafi%n, while the charges of carrying cou its peculiar form of -worship would be borne only by its members and these wiho participate in its services. Nodoubt, this would sotsati$fykhe wjple Non-couforo*ing community; stiUl it wonid satisfy many,, and wqnli disrm all of an argument which \they can n,ow with justie bring forwvard-viz., that they' are cpmpehlld tp cq,utribisbe the materials for carrying out a fcsr3n of worship to which fihey do not belong..

TH-V 3RCBA2xTILB MRIrxE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I hate read with interest your remarks on the mezshant service. You may not, however, be awar.e that tlet larine department of the Board of Trade haa for somb tine had under consideration the question of " uniforms2B In Jely, 1856, the late Admiral Beechey was good enough to ifnvie my opinion, and that of oUiers, on this subject. The correspondence I enclose; it is at your disposal for publicatioQ, if you consider it of any importamce. There is not afficient distinction betweeri the officer and seaman; the 'fault may often rest with tte formner, but the uniform will tend to remedy the evil. Your correspondents are quite correct. Our seamen, as a body, do not improve. I am aware that the generation which is passing away too often thinks very lightly of those who are to follow. Tevertheless, it is a stubborn fac' that, morally, socially, and physically, the British merchant sailor is not what he was 20 years ago. Since then far more attention has been paid to his comfort by his employers, the majority of shipowners feel an honest pride in aU that relates to his health and happiness, there is a vast improve. ment in the accommodation provided for him on board ship, his food is superior to what it was, and everybody 'will admit that there bas been no lack of legislative enactmentb to elevate and enlighten him; but stil the British merchant sailor does not improve. I have no returns before me, and I therefore write under correction, but I think it wMll be found that desertion at home, and more especially abroad, is on the increase. Insubordination, contempt for superiors, incapacity, and recklessness of conduct are, from all I can learn, as prevalent, if not more so than ever. How these evils are to bo remedied is a problem not easily solved. I fear, however, that we have been tinkering too much with the laws which regulate the merchant service. Too much legislation is as great, aud may be a greater evil than too little. I fear that of late the tendeaey has been to forget great, broad, and sound prin. ciples, while attention has been directed too closely to quesions of minute detail, which the Government would much better have left alone. If I may use the expression, we are getting too refined in oar legislation. We define by Act of Parliamenttoan inch the size of the berth in which a sailor is to sleep, to an ounce the quantity of food he is to consume, to a minute the time he is to work, and we have, bearing on such questions, a mass of laws which the most erudite lawyer cannot comprehend. Look, for instance, at the Mereantile Marine Art. It is a largo volume, but it is a volume of detail, and any one who may be disposed to wade through its pages can hardly but feel that the wise and prndent liberty of the subject-be he shipowner, officer, or seamen-hau been sadly imposed upon. The Government must sooner or later still further revise, greatly condense, and materially simplify these laws. It would be well to lay down a sound and broad principle, and leave questions of minute detail to those whose duty it is to see the law carried into effect. We mulst give to commanders and officers greater power over their men. A ship at e" is a little kdngdom in herself, and he who sits upon the throne for the time being ought to have more kingly authority. I do not seek for the commander of a merchantman one half of the power which is vested in the captain of a man-of. war, but it is that power which maintains over 20 times the number of men in the same limited space an order and discipline which it is vain to expect in the merchant service while our laws remain as they are at present. But if we grant to commanders of merchant vessels a greater power than they now possess, we ought in a corresponding degree to increase their responsibilities, and to make their punishment more severe for any abuse of that power. A change such as I venture to propose would mako the seamen themselves happier, better, and wiser, and would, I feel, do much to elevate and improve their condition, and to remove many of the evils which now exist. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, W. S. LINDSAY. 8, Autinfrin, April 16. " Board of Trade, July 12, 1856. "My dear Sir,-1 should be obliged if you would give me1 your opinion upon a matter of general interest to the mercantile navy. upon a late occasion in the Black Sea there were met together offlicers of the same servioe and of the same rank, but with such a variety of uniforms that our Ro al naval officers were puzzled to know who was who, anl one officer had more stripes of gold upon his arm than the commodore. " It has been suggested that this woulld be a good opportunity for Her Majesty to mark her approbation of the services rendered to the country by the mercantile marine by giving that service a uniform, distinguishing masters from mates, and limiting the privilege to those officers only who have passed the examinations. The uniform should be simple, but such as would impress the seamen with respect. The establishmnent of a uniform of this description would, it is believed, have a moral effect upon crews of ships gene. rally, and be acceptable to the profesaion. "I should be much obliged by a candid opinion. "I am yours faithfully, _ "~~~~1 W. . ZEC "The uniform is not to be compulsory. " W. S. iOndsay, Bsq., MJ?., &c. "8, Austinfriars, City, July 16, 1856. My dear Sir,-J should have answered your note of the 12th ere this, but of late I have been morn than usually busy. I like what you propose; it does you credit, and in my opinion the idea of conferring a uniform on the officers of themercantile marine as an acknowledgment of their services during the late war would be attended with the most beneficial results to al ooncerned, and, when stamped by Royal authority, would, I am sure, be duly appreciated and universally adopted. It could not fail to raise the tone of the service, induce a superior class of men to follow it as a profession, and reform the present system, greatly to the advantage of the public generally and the stipowners in particular, while it would hold out an inducement to individual exertions should the cointry again require the services of the mercantile navy-a navy, by the way (and I say it without the slightest reflection upon your own service) which has done much to make England great and wealthy, and which is a strong arm for her protection n the hour of need. "The description of uniform would require some consideration, and is of more importance than may at first ae pear, as anything tending to a servile demonstration would at once defeat the object in view. It should be simple, but of consequence; and rather be courted as a uniform than avoided as a livery. " I should not think it advisable to limit 'the privilege to those officers only who have pa-sed the examinations.' There are many most able and superior men in the service now who were commanders before Mr. Labouchere's Act came into operation, and who have consequently not passed an examination. "While upon this point I mayaswellstatewhathaarepeatedlycome under my notice. The term 'master,' as applied indiscriminately to all men in command, is objectionable. It is seldom voluntarily adopted, and too often made use of as a term of disparagement. I would suggest, tberefore, that it would be much to the advantage of the service were the appellation of commander, in conjunction with that of master, given officiaUy to those officers who had obtained a certain proficiency in their profession, to be determined by the Board of Trade, as an inducement to knowledge. " These are my ' candid opinions' as you desire, and you may make any use of them you please. If you think they are sound, and the Government likely to adopt them, I wil be happy to aid you in carrying them out. 'By the way, while the country is disposed to mark in i general terms the services of the mercantile marine during the late war, do you not think it would be but fair to officers in that semce if the names of those who particularlyexerted themselves were brought prominently forward, and a return of such could doubtless be obtained from the official records of the principal agents of transports in the Bl1ack Sea. "Very faithfullv yours, "Admiral Beechey, &c. iW. S. LINDSAY." I I
THE CASE OF BACON AND HIS WIFE.-It is understood that the two prisoners will be jointly tried for the murder of their children, aud that in such case the statement of the wife tbat her husband committed the murder' may be used as evidence against herself. It is expected that a joint defence will he made, and that this defence will be that the act of murder was committed by Mrs. Bacon while in an unsound state of mind, and that she is consequently not criminally responsible, and that the hnsband bad nothing whatever to do with the crime. If this defence shonld be suocessful, and Bacon shlould be acquitted, he will then be removed to the country to take his trial at the summer assizes for th6 murder of his mother. It appears that since the committal of the prisoners they have both been in a very despoiding way, particularly Bacon himself, aad' they are never left alone, six adnitional turnkeys being employ ed, three wonmen and three men, to watch them, two during the night, and one during the day. TEE DOUGLAS SUCCESSION.-An erroneous statement, quoted fromn a Glasgow cf,ntemporary, to the effeot that the succession to these estates devolves immediately on the Countess of Home, has been already corrected in T7e Times. We have reason to knowv that the estimato given in the paragraph allnesed to of the rental of those estates as amounting to about :5,0001. is also very incorrect, and that, although not actually doubled, as is often done by rumour in similar statemeuts, their value bas been magnified to the extent nearly of one-half by the imagination of the estimator. REFORN ATORY SCHOOLS. -Returns have beon made to Parliament of the Particulars, &c., of 35 reformatory schools established in Englanid, and 20 in the sister kingdom of Scotland. It includes the " Flome in the East" atoOld Ford, Bow (noticed a few days ago in the columns of The Times), a Catholic reformatory for hoys at Brook-green, Bammeramith; a school of discipline for girls in Queen's. road, ChelFea west; and the well known philanthropic fasu" s3chool at Reigate. REAPFING MAOHINES.-We sae informed that Baron Wrd has gi'en notice to the Ixrperial Agricultural Society of Tienna that he challenges aU reaping mnachines constructed in EEurope or America. to cdnpete with hiR (an improvement oc J{ussey's) patented in Vieona on the lOh of December, 1M6, for the sunm of 1.000 florins, to cut five Austrian jochs (nearly seven English acres) next harvest, on any ground in the Austrian domninions which the soceptor may please to choose. The acceptor has also the choice of rape, wheat, barley, oats, or clover- the only poidit4ons being that the prize shall be aa rded to the -machine wbich does the wyrk in the shortest time and the neatest mranner.
