IRELAND. (EFROM OUB OWN CORRESPONDENT.) DUBLIN, SATURDAY AlMOITOR. TBE CATHOLIC rATJI, A meeting of the metropolitan Roman Catholic fclergy was held yesterday, when it was resolved to adopt all available mncansto procure signatures to the petition drawvn Up by the Staord Club for an alteration, or abrog,ation ather, of the oath taken by Catholic members Of Parliament. Archbishop Cullen takes the lead in his own parish, and the clergy will, as usual, be present to-morrow to animato and direct their parishioners. The Freeumtn's Journal, alluding to a recent article in The Times *upon the conduct and policy of the Roman Catholic part7 in reference to the Oaths Bill, observes :- " It is true, as The Times alleges, that for nearly 30 years the oath of 1829 has been no bar to the freedom of voting and debate in either House. But it is equally true that the terms of that oath have frequently given rise to taunts and Insults against the Catholic members, and that they are of a nature to wound the pride and self-respect of spirited and independent men. at Catholio must not feel aggrieved wben he finds that he will be debarred from the exercise of his 'constitutional rights unless he takes a special oath, which draws a distinction between himself and other men, who he feels are not in any respect his superiors, land brands him as an object of suspicion or as an inferior? What could be more natural or reasonable than to ask the Government, when they themselves have introduced the subject of Parliamentary oaths, to deal with the question in a broad, liberal, and comprehensive spirit, by placing all religious sects on a footing of perfect equality? We repu diate the notion which is imnidiously put forward by TIhe Times that the Catholics have any desire to impede the removal of Jewish disabilities; but we cry that they vwould be untrue to themselves and deficient in manly spirit if they failed to assert their right to equal privileges with the Jews. If they were so foolish as to place their claims in abeyance, and submit in silenco to the meditated in3justice, so far from conciliating their enemies by this forbearance, they wou'd incur contempt in addition to hostility." MR. SMITH O'BRIEN ON IrtISH PoIMCS. A public dinner at Rathkeale to Archdeacon Fitzgerald, an extremely aged member of the Young Ireland party, has afforded an opportunity to Mr. Smith O'Brien for laying before his countrymen an exposition of his views upon Irish affairs and particularly tenant-right. In a letterapologizing for his absence at the Rathkeale festivities Mr. O'Brien thus writes:- " Governed by considerations that were founded upon my past experience of Irish agitation, I formed a resolntion before I returned to Ireland that I would not join any political associations or attend any political meetings, and that I would limit my interference in Irish politics to the occasional expression of my own individual opinion. Acting upon this determination, which I have as yet found no reason to abrogate, I have declined attendance at several polatical meetings to which I have been invited. Now,if I wehe to depart from this rule in the case of the Rathkeale dinner I should find it difflcult to refuse similar invitations on future occasions. I have no desire, howrever, to conceal my opinions on the present state ofÂ¢ public affairs, or to disavow my sympathy with the objects of your meeting. I have already, since my return from exile, taken occasion to declare that I am more than ever convinced that Ireland requlires a national Legislature andl a national Executive to give this country full advantage of tLe resources which it soseneses. In the absence of such a domestio Government t seems to me that the national interests of Ireland can b e best protected by sending to the British Parliament a body of members who shall hold themselves entirely independent of all Engli.h parties, and avail themselves of every opportunity that may present itself in the conflict of rival factions to secure for Ireland the enactment of useful measures and the attainment of our national rights. Among the measures which are at present considered most urgent by the public opinion of this country is the Bill for securing to tenants, in case of eviction, compensation for profitable improvements, which was prepared many years ago by Msr. Sharman Crawford, and 1 quite concur in the propriety of requiring that this measure shall be enacted without further delay. t is to be regretted, indeed, that the number of members returned at the late election on the principle of " Independent Opposition" was not so great as might have been expected, but we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that many of those members who have proved faithless totho pledges formerly made by them in favour of tenant right have been excluded from Parliament, and also that nearly all the candidates who have been returned for popular constituencies have promised their advocacy of the first claims of the tenantry of Ireland, If the declarations made by Irish gentlemen at the hustings be not wholly worthless, a large mnajority of the Irish members are bound by the sacred obligations of public and private honour to a pply themselveswith sincerity and earnestness to the accompihment of this object. Two additional considerations might lead us to form a well-grounded hope that this question will be speedily adjusted if any reliance could be placed upon the disposition of the British Parliament to legislate for Ireland upon wise and just principles. The first is that several of the clauses of former BiUs which were considered objectionable to landlords have been withdrawn. The second is tbat Lord Palmerston's Government can no longer plead inabilty to give effect to a principle which, in profession at least, they affect to approve; for it is the boast of the supvorters of the present Government that the recent elections ave greatly increased the Parliamentary strength of the party which Lord Palmerston's Administration is upheld. For my own part, I expeot little good for Ireland from the legislation of a British Parliament; but the earnest aDd persevering manifestation of Irish opinion may have some i niluence upon British statesmen, and in this point of viewv the demensiration which is about to be made at Rathkeale may be productive of advantage." DR. NEWM. AN. Notwithstanding all the "authorized" denials of the resignation of the rectorship of the Catholic tniversit by Dr. Newman, it is now officially announced by the Toblet of this day that the periol for which the rev. gentleman consented to undertake the laborious and anxious post of head of the University, " which he has founded and built up, is abont to terminate." Dr. Newman, it is pleaded is anxious to return to his home, his missionary duties, and his books at Edgbaston. Not a doubt of it. But by way of putting] the best face on the affair, the organ adds:- "Though this be so, there is sure to be a strong and very general wish that Dr. Newman should not materially alttr tbe nature of his connexion with the University, even if he shonld prefer to fill some other than his present post, and one which did not require more than occasional residence. It is quite obvious that Dr. Newman, by short but regular residences at intervals, with the aid of correspondence, could be all and more to the University than any one is now entitled to require him to be. There are periods in the growth of every corporate body when constant watchin g and readiness for personal reference are required. Bat this state of things is not incessant. There are times when people may be fairly and wholesomely left to test their stren3gth and rely upon their own courage and energies, supported by occasional supervision and encouragement. Some such course the bishops will probably desire to see pursued, and if so, efforts will probably be made to induce Dr. NewmzaEn eto ceontinhue in his prtes,ent pest owith stated periods of A WARNINRG TO PLAOESEEKER5. In the abstract of the new Irish Secretary's speech to his constituents on his re-election last Tue3day, and which appeared in The Times of Thursday, there was Lo mention of an episode the omission of which would be quite inexcusable, inasmuch as the point involved is not merely of local interest, but comes home to the bosoms of a large class of Her MIajesty's subjects in every portion of her dominions. Just before winding up his address Mr. Herbert thus delicately observed:- " There is one more question to which I wisk to ask your attention. It is rather a delicate one, but I trust to the good humour, kindness, and good sense of my countrymen to listen to me for a few moments on the subject. I allude to the subject of patronage. Youall know, propably-at all events, you all believe -that, in consequence of the appointmeat I have received, I bave a considerable amount of wbat may be called, in familiar language, 'the loaves and fishes' un er my distribution. '- Con. Lamb (an electcr).-Signs by, you'll be troubled cith a great deal of applications. (Lauhter.) * Colonel Herbert -You are quite right. That's whak I was coming to. }Laughter.) Con. Lamnb.- Tis the most troublesome situation a man canbold, Godihelpyou.I(Laughter.) Andhalfofthemthat -would cut your tbrost are bowing and scraping about you now. (Laughter from the gallery.) You want a couple of dozen clerks to read and answer your letters. I hope you will be after making out an easy berth, you know, for me now in my old days. (Laughter.) "Colonel lerberti-Somuchl do I consider myself indebted to the electors of the county, not only for the honour of electing me, but for the kindness with which they have always viewed any efforts of mine, and the forbearance they have exercised towards me, that I really speak the honest truth when I tell you that, if I consulted my own feelings, every man in Kerry who wanted a berth should have the very best place I could give him, with the least possible to do and the largest possible salary. (Laughter.) "Con. Lamb.-That would just suit my knuckle to a nicety. (Laughter.) "Colonel Herbert.-But I am placed in a publio and responsible position, in wvich it is my duty, as far as I ama able, to consult the publc interests. I must just ask you to consider that if I am guilty of perpetrating a job I diEgrace myself, andreflect disgrace on you(hear, hear), because if a man has been without opposition for 10 years your representative it reflects on your choice if it can be fairly said of him, when he comes into an official position, that he has been guilty of a job. Do not for a moment suppose that I am such a fool as to think I am going to inaugurate a period of perfect purity, and do not imagine that political and personal considerations will not have their weight. But I must remind you that the tendency of public opinion has been of late- most properly in my mind-to put down, as far as it is possible, anything like jobs or unfair patronage. Within the last few years a system has been adopted in Dublin of holdiDg up for competition some of the best offices to be given away by the Secretary. Do not suppose for amoment thatl can attempt to put aside that system. Still, do not SUppOse that it will not be my wish, whenever I can ltgitimately. to serve any one of my felow-countrymen; but I entreat of you to remember that I have now the honour to be not only your representative, but that the whole of Ireland has other claims upon me." (Hear, hear.) ENCTUIBEUED ESTATES COUIRT. The extensive estates of Sir Edmund Hayes, M.P., Aituated in the county of I)onegal, were sold yeaterday before Mr. Commissioner Hargreave. The property was offered in 63 lots, producing a net rental of Dearly 6,0001. a-year, the whole of which was disT osed oI for the gross sum of 93,4071. The estates of James Sadleir, situated in the countie8i of Waterford, Tipperary, and Limerick, are advertised for sale in enrietta-street on Tuesday, the 7th of July ner,t. The petitioner for the sale is the official manager for winding up the affairs of the Tipperary Bank. The property is offered in three lots, the gross net rental of which is estimated at 1,2821. per annum. In the present flourishing state of the Irish land-market-22 years' rate of purchase being the average for well circumstanced estates-a handsome sum ought to be realized towards the relief of the unfortunate victims of the Sadleir swindle. RIEsH BANKING PROSPErrY. The Dutblin Mercantile Advertiser says,- " In referring to the last report of the National Bank, It was our gratifying duty to notice the continued improve. Inent In banking affairs in Ireland. A further very remarkable evidence of this nature is afforded by the re rrt of the half-yearly meeting of the proprietors of Bxof Ireland stock, held on Thursday, wheu the de%uty-governor, Mr. Haliday, who presided, announced that the dividend for the last balf-year was 6 per cent", being at the rate of 13 per cent. per annum; and he added tht, after the payment of this dividend out of the clear profits of .he half-year, there was a surplus of 1,8001. to be addod to the rest. A s our readers are aware, the ordinary dividend of the Bank of Ireland had been at the rate of 8 per cent. per annnnn. and latterly had been increased to 4A per cen. for the half-year, or 9 per cent. per anum. Tho dividend declared on Thursday of 6 per cent. for the last aix months is therefore an increase of 2 per cent. on the half-year. This prosperous condition of the Bank of Ireland is another evidence of the increase of wealth in Ireland, and of the healthy condition of trade and agriculture. The Irish bankls generally are in the same satisfactory state of progremion."' TEB FUN'DS. Threa per Cent. Consols (shut), 92 ; ditto, for account, 8tb of July, 921 93: New Three per Cent.

LYOEUM THEATRE. In Plutarch's treatio "Virtutes Mulierum," which forms one of the " Moralia," will be found a story that may be interpreted somewhat in this fashion:- Among the tetrarchs in Galatia Sinatus and Synorix, who were, moreover, related to each other, 'were most powerful. Of these Sinatus had a wife named Camma, adujirable for her beauty and youth, and still more a marvel on account of her virtue; for not only was she chaste and devoted to her husband, but she was also wise and magnanimous, and sias greatly endeared to her subjects by her goodness and benignity. She was rendered yet more illustrious by the circumstance that she was the priestess of Artemis, who is chiefly revered by the Galatiana, being always seen magnificently adorned on the occasion of processions and sacrificts. Now, Synorix, being enamoured of her, and being unable to obtain her, either by persuasion or by force, in the lifetime of her husband, perpetrated a dreadful crime, for he slew Sinatus by stealth, and not long afterwards wooed Camnma, while she was occupied in the temple, enduring the wrong which he had wrought, not n a pitiful or abject manner, but retaining the full force of her mind and watehing her opportunity. But Synorixwas assiduous in his suit, and seemed to be notaltogetherideficint in specious words, saying that in ther respects he was superior to Sinatus, and that he had kiUled him through love for Camma, and not from auv other motive. Bven at first she was not very harsh in her refusal, and afterwards she seemed to be gradually softening; for her friends and relations, wishing to oblge Synorix wvhose power was very great, persuaded and urged her to give her consent. At last she yielded to their entreatiee and sent for Synorix, that the marriage might be solemnized in the presence of the goddess. When he came she gave him a bland reception, and, leading him to the altar, poured alibation from a patera. She then drank part of the remaining contents herself, and commanded Synorix to drink a part likewise. Now, the drink was mixed with poison. Wben she saw him fall she shouted aloud, and, invokin the goddess, said, " I call thee to witness, most venerated deity, that for the sake of this day I have survived the murder of Sinatus, from the time of that event having had no comfort in life, save the hole of revenge, which having attained I go down to join my husband. But for thee, 0 most impious of men, let thy kindred prepare a tomb in lieu of a bridal chamber." The Galatian having heard these words, and feeling the poison actively working in his body, mounted a chariot, thinking to be healed by the motion, but suddenly alighted, snd, placing himself on a litter, died in the evening. But Camma having lived through the night, and having heard that Synorix was dead, cheerfully breathed ber Last, Without adding a single incident to the above stor,; Signor lMontaneli has converted it into a drama of sustained interest, and has made of the heroine a worthy associate of the Medeas and the Normas. The tale itself falls naturally into the three acts of which the play consists. In the fist act the intelligeuce of the murder of Sinatus by an unknown hand is brought to Camma while she is officiat ing in her temple, and she at once suspects Synorix-called in the play "' Sinoro "-to be the guilty man. In the second act Sinoro declares his love to Camma, and is lured into an avowal of his guilt by her assertion that she can only marry the murderer of her first husband. In the third the retribation is effected precisely after the fashion indicated by Plutarch. save that Sinoro does not try to jolt himself into good health, and that Camma survives but a few minutes the a:complishment of the scheme of vengeance. Great pains have been taken to determine the character of Camma, which, we believe, has been written on purpose for Madame Ristori. The devotion of the wife is com. bined with the sanctity of the priestess, and it must be assuraed throughout that the vengeance taken on Sinoro is an act of duty. Camma is also endowed with the virtue of patriotism, for the slain Sinatus was an upholder of national independence among the Celtic settlers in Galatia, whereas Sinoro is inclined to temporize with the Romans. Hence, when the death of the former is avenged, the cause of the Celtic race is asserted. Even the religious distinotion batween Druiiism and classical paganism is made prominent, and stress is laid on Camma's belief in the transmigration of souls, as likely to render the thought of death less terrible. She is a saint at the 'eginning, she becomes a mere woman to work out her plan of retribution; but, her mission accomplished, she Is a saint once more, and dies in a condition of ecstatio beatitude. To those readers who may object that vindictiveness is not the summit of female virtue we need only observe that an antique race is to be judged by its own ethical standard, and that if we take a story from Plutarch's "M Morals" we have a right to adopt Plutarch's morality. On Friday ni ht Camma, which was produced in Paris during Madame istori's recent engagementthere, was played fortbe first time inLondon. We need not saythat she gives a fine ideal representation of the Celtic priestess, for whoever is acquaint d with her style will at once imagine how she deported herself from a mere perusal of the story. The especially great scene was the interview with Sinoro, where she works him up by every artifice into a confession of his crime, and even feigns a love that is abhorrent to her nature. Thus there is a perpetual struggle between the real and the assumed feelings that at one uassage reaches a climax absolutely terrific. Hlaving already avowed his guilt, Sinoro adds that in an access of jealousy he plucked out the heart of his victim, and this horrible recital causes the face of Camma to be convulsed with abhorrence. Bat with the rapidity of lightning she obliterates the expression, andallows a gleam of savage joy to pass over her countenance. And there is another joy, that is not assumed -the satisfaction that she holds her prey within her graspand by a snake-like glance she expresses her true emotionF'. We have already saii that after the accomplishment of her mission, which involves self-destruetion, Camma becomes a species of saint. This idea is elaborated to the utmost by Madame Ristori, who has no sooner swallowed the poison than she becomes the inhabitant of another world, now denouncing her victim with the air of a retributive goddess, now holding converso with the visionary heroes of her country, and regretting that death is so slow in releasing her from those earthly bonds that detain her from her beloved husband. When she is the instrument of wrath sbe displays all the majesty of her gesticulation, when she is swayed by the softer affections she employs all the music of her voice, her declamation becoming at times almost lyrical in its character. She was loudly caled at the end of each act, and Camma is lkely to remain one of the most successful characters in her repertory The scenery and costumes illestrative of Druidical life are n the best taste, transporting the spectator to a kind of Asiatic Stonehenge.
Tir RIFF PIRATES.-The following is a list of ships belonging to British subjects captured by the Riff pirates between 1846 and 18.56, viz. :-the Ruth, Captain William Newham; the Three Sisters, Captain James Henry Forster; the Violet, Captain Toma n * the Vampire, Captain John Sans; the Cuthbert Youn, Captain JohI Marsball; the Lively, Captain James apier, the Conference, Captain Peter ; and the Hymen, Captaiu James Smith. The value of the Ruth and cargo was 1 9701.; that of the Violet aud cargo, 3,4001. ; that of the Conference and caro, 3,1621.; andthat of the Hymen and cargo, 3. 651L The other vessels are not valued. Only one, theViolet, was ransomed for 881. In the case of one, the Violet, 3001. was received as compensation from the English Government, and in the case of the Hymen 3,2781. was received from the Emperor of Morooco. Four of the shirs were recaptured. The above details are derived from a return to the House of Commons published on Saturday. IWVICn HAROUR.-Tho .Northern E8Wign, in complaining of the exposed state of the Harbour of Wick, says: -" During the approaching herring Sshery season we shall have from 1,120 to 1,150 boats engaged in this perilous enterprise.

BANDBL FRSTIvAL, CRYSTAL PALACE. The full rehearsal for this grand and unexampled cele. bration, which, although entifly rhe work of a society of amateurs (the Sacred Harmonio Society), may be fairly 3egarded-that socety representing the musical taste of England in Its noblest aud purest expression-as the homage -of a great nation to a great man, took place on Saturday morning in the Crystal Palace, before en assemblage of many thousands of persons. For the first time was tested the combined effect of the much-vaunted 2,500 singers and Players, in theimmense and elaborately censtructed orchestra prepared for their reception, and with a space for sound to travel in wlhich no ingenuity could devise the means of nclosing, and which had consequently rendered questionable the wisdom of the experiment when judged from the point of view of acoustics. Hesitation, nevertheless, w s partially checked from the very outset; and as the music went on, and the area gradually filled, the result became less and less uncertain, until finally all doubt was expelled. and the apprehensions preposterously entertained in certain timorous quarters with regard to the possible effects of reverberation on the roof and Bides of the building, having altogether vanished, a triumphant success for the Handea Festival was unanimously and confidently predicted. To convey any idea of the sight that unfolded itself to the spectator, in no matter what part of the edifice contiguous to the area he might be situated-whether from th3 orchestra and the adjacent gaUeries, looking down upon the multitude below, or from the base of the cantral transept, gazing up at the orchestre, with its army of musicians of both sexes, backed by the gigantic organ towering to the roof-whether from the organ loft Itself, or from the reo motest of the galleries facing it, whence in either instance the eye might comprehend the whole prodigioug end variegated picture at a glance-would deman& the graphic pen of ono who has described thelparaphernalia of Imperial consecration with the same vivid eloquence as he has portrayed the evolutions of martial hosts, the array, the incidents, and sanguinary results of battle. Wo can only say that even those most familiar with the interior of the " Palace made of windows," and under circumstances of the greatest festivity, can form no notion of it, but must await the experience of to-day to acknowledge that they have never beheld the like before. To argae from the incessant circulation which took place during the rehearsal, there was as much anxiety to obtain a series of views as even to judge of the effect of the music. The wind ing staircases that connect the galleries with each other ap peawed to distant beholders as though endowed with loco motive power-as if, indeed, they themselves were making. with strange evolutions, the passage from platform to platform, of which they were merely the unconscious instruments under the pressure of living feet. The opportunity of perpetuating so imposing a spectacle was not lost, since, while Mr. Costa was directing the rehearsal of one of the choruses, Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, photographers th the Crystal Palace Company, procured, in almost an instaar of time, for the stereoscope a very strildng daguerreotype-iew of the whole orchestra and a great part of the audience which was subsequently forwarded to Her Majesty ths Queen. The orchestra, its aspect, and the method of its coastraction have already been described in general terms; but a few brief technical memoranda will not be out of place. This really ingenious and novel work of architectural carpentry was not erected by contract (like its costy predecessor, at the inauguration of the Sydenham Palace in 1854), but plAnned and completed by Mr. W. Earee, the company's resident clerk of the works, assisted by the permanent staff of workmen. It occupies a spaco of 14,784 superficial feet, 168 feet wide, and absorbs 10,102 cubical feet of timber. The weight of the entire structure is a'bout 160 tons The banks of seats for the chorus are 23 in number, which, with 9 for the instrumental performers, makes a total of 32. The highest range is 52 feet from the floor of the orchestra, where Mr. Costa, the conductor, and the principal vocalists are stationed. The average curved extent of each range of seats is 190 feet. This huge mass of timber is supported by "u uprights," with a scantling of 5 inches by 5, and diagonal braces 4 inches by 1J. The whole framework is distributed in Equares of 8 feet, "centre and eentre." The organ, erected for the occadon by Messrs. Gray and Davison (who also built the instrument for the last Handel commemoration, which took place in 1834, at Westminster Abbey) covers an area of 42 x 26 feet, and is supported by a platform of enormous strength and solidity. Some description of this magnificent instrument-of which Saturday's experience, under the hands and feet of Mr. BrownEmith, organist to the Sacred Harmonic Society, more tha's confirmed the favourable anticipations-has already been given in 27We mes, accompanied by a catalogue of its stops, &c. Any attempt at a tecbnical analysis of its mechani. cal construction, or even at an abstract appreciation of its merits, would be out of place in the columns of a newspaper not exclusively devoted to such matters; but we may afford spacefora short extract from a pamphlet evidently written by an accomplished connoisseur, and which enters at great length into the peculiar claims of the new instrument to b3 regarded as one of the most admirable works of English manufacture:- "The aim of the builders has been to produce an instrument the varied qualities of which should combine all desirable musical beauty with force a3ad grandeur of tone suicient to qualify it for the part it is specially destined to bear in this great commemoration; and, should the result bepronounced successful, it iS presumed that the very unusual difficulties towhich the instrument is subjected wil he felt to proportionately enhance the credit due to its constructors. On an occasion wvhen all the preparations are on so vast a scale it will be naturally concluded that the festival organ mlut be, even in the obviousand exteroal sense, a very large instrument. In this particular it is highly probable that the spectator will at a first glance be disappointed. Theprodigious dimensions of the transept of the Crystal Palace, dwarfing to all but insignificance every single object it encloses, operates of course, in greatly diminisbing the apparent magnitude of the organ. The reader has been elsewhere Informed that the orchestra prepared for this occasion ' alone covers considerably more space than is found in any muic-hall in the kingdom ' and similarly he maybe asisted to estimate the space occupied by the organ if told that it stands on more ground than that alotted to most ordinary houses. Its widthis 40 feet by a depth of 30. He will, perhaps, be at a loss to conceive how by any possibility a musical instrument can require all these 1,200 superficialfeet of standing room, and be tempted to set it down as a piece of display-an attempt to impose on him by the mere appearanco of magnitude. A few simple facts will, however, convince him that these arrangements are controlled by a necessity passing all show. When he is told that this organ contains 4,510 sounding pipes. varying in size from 32 feet in length with a diameter sufficient to easily admit the passage of a stout man's body, to less than 1 inch in length, with the bore of an ordinary quil that, in order to place these 4,510 pipes efficiently a the performer's disposal, at least 6,800 other separate working parts arerequired(many ofthesebeingoompletemachines in themselves, the separate members of which, if reckoned as in the process of manufacture. would at least quintuple the number); thatall these 11,310 sounding and working parts rsquire such a disposition and arrangement that each one may be more or less easily accessible for those occasions of adjustment wbich must frequently arise in so complicated an instrument; and, finally, that the entire massbeforehim weighs nearly 50 tons, he will scarcely fail to perceive that the space is economically ratber than ostentatiously occupied, and will, moreover, be enabled perhaps to understand some of those points often deemed mysteriQus with regard to large organs in general-such, for example, as their oost and the time occupied in their manufacture. " Internally the Crystal Palace oan is beyond doubt a very large instrument. Although the number of its pipes is for many reasons a very fallacioug test, when applied to the power and capability of such an instrumeut, it may be welf to state that in this respect it considerably exceeds the world-famous organ at laietn-the total number of pipes in the latter being 4.088, while, were the two placed side by side In the Crystal Palace orchestra, the difference in point of power would be still more remarkable. The performer has at his disposal four complete rows of keys, each having a compass of 58 notes, and each commanding a distinct department of the instrument. He has also a set of ' pedals' -a key-boad played by his feet, in factby means of which he calls forth the ponderous basses necessary to support the general harmony." Further opportunities are to be afforded of testing the powers of the organ in the intervals of the festival days, when Messrs. T. Best (of St. George's Hall, Liverpool), George Cooper (of St. Sepulchre and St. Paul's), and Henry Smart, three of the most competent organists in this country, will respectively perform upon it, for the edification and instruction of visitors. But to return to the rehearsal. The mere preliminary of getting 2,500 vocal and instrumental performers in their places without confusion would, it was very naturally Imagined, involve a labour of no ordinary difficulty; but so efficient were the precautions adopted, and so easy the means of ingress and egress, that the feat was accomplishedwithouta single misunderstanding. At U o'clock, the hour appointed for beginning, every singer and every player was stationed in the spot assigned, while every instrument and every mu;ic book was at the immediate disposal of the owners. ThM: shows how much, with how little pains and in how shoit a time, can be effected by simple regulations and strict discipline. The regulations were due to the committse of the Sacred Hlarmonic Society, under the superintendence of their untiring agent, Mr. Robert Bowley; the discipline proceeded from the moral control of Mr. Costa, to the exercise of which he owes no little of the influence bo-h social and professional that has invariably attahed to his position. The generalissimo, whose duty was to marshal and review the harmonious host assembled at the mighty name of Handel, was (as usual) to the minute at his poest. The cheers and acclamations that greeted him, no' only from the crowds that peopled the area and galleries, but from bis own forces, anxiously awaiting the first gyrations of his familiar wand, testified to 'she popular deference So b e wox through his own psrseveeano,. ._s4 convi- tion that he was born to sway, and not to serve. For a moment Handel bimself, the Crystal Pslace, and all that it contained were forgotten in Mr. Costa; bat when -after the overkre to the Messiah had been per. formed (in which the amaziing force of Stringed instrnients almost bewildered the hearer favourably enough situated to catch the entire volume of sound)-the firs strains of that majestic chorus, " And the glory of the Lord," were led off by the altos, answered by the trebles, and the whole measure of harmony filled simultaneously up by tenors and basses, Handel re umed his sceptre, and from that instant remained undisputed monarch of the day. Several choruses from the first and second parts of the Afessiah were gone through, and, among others, " For unto us a child is born," " He is the King of Glory, and " The Lord gave the word, great was the company of the preachers!'-all of which (and they are very different in character) produced a marked sensation. But from the subline "Hallelujah" mostwasexpected,andthe greatest results were obtainedL Tho weight and sonority of the numberless bass voices, in unison, on the passage "He shall reign for ever and ever," which forms one of the counter themes of this transeudant hymn, were marvellous; and when-at the end of the progression (so wondrous from its combined simplicity and grandeur), ia which the treble, hold out a succession of long.suaslned notes, from D up to G -theentireforce of voices andinstrumentsunited in givin emphasis to the chord which leads to the resumption of the origina key, the effect wasnothingahort of stupendous. Itis worthy oEf remark that, "greata as was the company of' singers and players, their efficiency was not only preserved in passages where they are employed on plain harmony, but just as much where the worldng of two themes in conjunc. tion renders the acquisition of clearness and precision a task of much more difficulty. There was not the slighest evidenco of hefitation from beginningtoend. Wo have one observationtomake, however,inamorecriticalspirit. Itmay be absolutely necessary, under the conditions of sucha per. formance in such a place, andwith such a host, to take the " allelujah" and other choruses dower than the composer meant, but it is auredly notneessaryyto depart from his in tentionu withoutsomebeneficialrelt to anction tho liberty Now, no suchrsult, but the contrary, is derived from tho "epianizaino," upon which Mr. Costa insists, at the commencement of the chorus " For unto us a child is born,', andas far on as to the passage on the words " wonderfulcounsellor-the mighty God-the everlasting Father-the Prince of Peace." There is no wa&rant for such a reading. The proclamation of the birth of a Saviour is not made in a whisper, as if it were a secret perilous to disclose, but in accents of exultation, conveying the joy and gratitude of the nations at their delivery. An abstract musical effect may, perhaps, be at. tained by the sudden burst upon the word " wonderful,' after a long continuance of underbreath singing, but it is an effect wholy independent of the words. Handel has given appropriate significance to the exclamation by putting the voioes in fuU harmony and reinforcing them with the whole strength of the orchestra. Bat we protest here against this reading chiefly because it fails, under the actual circumstances, to achieve the point contemplated. Where we were placed during the performance of " For unto us a child is born," almost the whole of that part which precedes the exclamation, "Wonderful!" was lost. We could not hear the trebles givo out the theme, nor the tenors answer them, nor the altos respond to the tenors, nrr the basses join the altos with their florid divisions. Nor was the counter-theme, introduced by the tenors (" And the government be upon His shoulders"), distinctly audible; or, indeed, anything until the arrival of the fortissimow on the word " wonderfal," which was the first indication to many not intent upon the movements of the condnctor's stick that any singing or playing was going on. It is easy to adjust this misconception (to which, as was shown at Exeter-hall on Friday night, the provincial singers were evidently unaccustomed), and thus prevent one of the finest pieces in the Messch from losing a great part of its impressiveness. After the Jfessiah several choruses from Judas caocbaus were rehearsed, and to such good purpose as to encourage the belief that Wednesday's performance wil be as musically attractive as any. Among others must be noted as particularly successful the pathetic lamentation for Mattathias-" Mourn ye afflicted children"-with whom this noble oratorio is inaugurated; " Disdainful of danger," and "W we never will bow down," both masterpieces of energetic choral declamion; and, last and best, the magnificeat "Fallen is the foe," at the opening of Part IL, which even the composer of the' 3fesah and Israel has never surpassed. " See tho conquering hero comes" (appropriated by Handel himself from the oratorio of Joshua), and the march that follows it, so picturesque and full of character, were also among the pieces tried, and were listen-d to with eager attention by the audience, which at this period had swelled into a veritable multitude-greatly in favour, by the way, of the musical effect. Tho rehearsal of Judas was rendered additionally agreeable by the ap pearance of two of the principal solo-singers, Madame Clara Novello and Mr. Sims Beeves-the former of whom sang the recitative and air, " Oh Liberty," and the latter the fiery war song of Judas-" Sound an alarm." These highly esteemed artist were received with due honours. The reception accorded to Mr. Sims Beeves, however, both by the orchestra and the audience, was overwhelming; and this, no doubt, urged him to unwonted enthuasm, since on no previous occasion have we heard him sing, either "Sound an alarm" or anything else, with such splendid energy and dramatic power (for the air in question is dramatic to all intents and purposes). It was surprising no less thau gratifying to witness so lively an impression produced by our English tenor, after the unwonted displays of choral grandeur that had gone before. Not the least interesting feature in the performance of Judas Moaccbaus will be the extra orchestral accompaunments supplied by the experienced pen of Mr. Costa, of the merits of which-as they were doubtless written with a special view to the dimensions of the Crystal Palace-we shall not pretend to judge until we hear them in a more circumscribed arena. After the interval of an hour-during which Mfr. Staples and his numerous staff were busily employed, and apparetly to the satisfaction of every one who had recourso to their aid-the vast orchestra (which had been emptied with great expedition) was once more tenanted-the same order and preciion being observed as at the commencement of the rehearsaL Several pieces, chiefly choral, from Ircl in. Egypt were now tried, including the opening chorus, " And the children of Israel sighed "He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies ;" "Hegave them hailstones ;" "He sent a thick darkness J" " He smote all the firstborn of Egypt ;" "He led them through the deep " "Bat the waters overwhelmed them;" "The depths have covered them," " Thy right hand 0 Lord is be-come (as Handel has accentuated it) glorious in power ," "The people shall hear " and the "Horse and his rider." For more reasons than one the chorases from Israel were the most satisfactory essays of the morning. This astonishing work-the cheral masterpiece of Handel composed the same year as Saul, just after his fainre as manager of the Italian Opera, when he was honourably bent upon defraying the debts he had incurred, and in the incredibly brief space of 27 days !-or rather so much of it as was given on Saturday, has never before been heard to such advantage. Tho well-known "Hailstone" chorus literally " electrified" the audience, who, forgettiRg it was only a rehearsal at which they were presiding, insisted with such unanimous perseverance upoa a repetition, that, in order to obtain silence, and be enabled to proceed with his duties, Mr. Costa was compelled to as. cord his assent, and so the piece was gone tbrough again, to the great delight of all present. The double choruses in which Israel in EBsZpt abounds came out with extraordinary power. But-which was still more gratifying-the two pieces where false or wavering intonation has almost passed into a tradition, or at least been overlooked as inevitable, " He sent a thick4darkness" and " The people shal hear," were sung by the multitude of voices perfectly in tune from end to end. Nevertheless, we must again object to the accomplished Neapolitan conductor's reading of a very important point. We allude to the termination of the choral recita tive, " He sent a thick darkness," which was robbed of its awfully impressive character by slackening the time on the words " which might be felt," and especially by dwelling longer than the composer has indicated on the monosyllable "'be." This imparted a theatrical character to one of the most solemn passages in the whole of rsrad-the leas: theatrical and most severely uncompromising of all the oratorlos of Handel. Solo singers soil take such liberties, and no one can prevent them; but we should regret to see the system even tolerated, much more inculcated, in choirs that have to deal with sacred music. Another of the principal singers-Miss - Dolov-camo forward at this period of the rehearsal, and tried, with eminent success, the peculiar and not over-grate. ful air, " Their land brought forth frogs." Much disappointment was felt that the famous duet for basses, " The Lord is a man of war," was not rehearsed by Herr Formes and Mr. Weiss, who were both present, and whowe fine voices every one was auxious to hear. This probationary performance terminated with the national anthem, the effect of which from such a congregation of vocal and instrumental performers may be well imagined. Mr. Costa then summoned the superintendents of the various London and provincial branches of the chorus, with whom it was arranged that the sopranos and altos should change places with the tenors and basses in the orchestra. The Idea was happy, sincethe fairer members of the c04xM w1l aow be stationed in the tentre, ry hWU must certainly prove advantageous tothe general effect, SiUce during the rehearsl it ws more than onoe remarked that the male voices were heard with muoh greater di8tinctness than tbe others. Moreover, the aspect of the orchestra will derive an additional grace from the fact of the 750 ladies of the chorus being so placedw a to be visible from all partes of the area galleries. We need scarcely state that the performances come off to-day, Wednesday, and Friday, and that the oratorios selected are tho MessWa, Jud=s AUaccaowu, and Israel in Egypt. After Judcs AHaccabcus on Wednesday it is intended that the Old Hundredth Psalm-which made so profound an impression at the inauguration of the Crystal Palace in 1851-shall be sung. One verse will be given in unison by the whole of the 2,000 voices. The financial suocess of the Handel Festival is, we have gcol reason to believe, placed beyond a question. By agree. ment with the Crystal PaLa Company the committee of the Sacred Hrmonic Society bound themselves not to exceed a stated outlay, and tho limits proposed and adopted have not been transgressed. Previous to the rehearsal on Saturday it was calculapted that a profit of between 3,0031. and 4,0001. over and above expenses had already been S2alized; and, as on such oocasions a large number of persons invariably defer secuing places until the eleventh hour, a materialaddition may reaonablybe counted on. It is as well to suggest, for the benefit of the publio, that, although tickets for the performances may be obtained, as usual, t the entrance of the Crystl Palace, it will save both time and trouble to apply for them in advance, either at the central office, in Exeter-hell or at the branch offioe, 79, Lom. bard-street, both of which are open at 8 a.m. The numbers of persons who have come ts London on purpose to attend the Hndel Festival wM doubtless exercise a beneficial influence elsewhere. Not to name the Opera and othertheatres, we masy point to places which it is morm ediYing to see crowded. Westminster Abbey, for example, was filled to overflowing yesterday morning by an attentive and devout congregation, consisting in a largs measure of provincials. To condude, if the accommodation for visitors by rail be as well and expeditiously conducted as on SAturday, there will be no rson to apprehend the slightest difficulty in approaching the Crstal Palace 1b that method of oonvey. ance; while, on the other hand, the wealthy owners of carriages and broughamr, together .with the less pretending charterers of cabs and other Tehicles on hire, will be pleased to lean that a good deal of the dust has been laid on the road leading from Dulwich to the Palce, so that the extra halfpenny extorted at the turnpike will be no longer aggravated by the inconvenienoe of a simoom.
EBR MAJESTPS THEATRE. The great success that has attended the Tevival of Don Giovanni is a convincing proof that the taste for that classical music which the) most cultivated persons have foryears been accustomed to regard with veneration is by no means on the decline. Broad as the popularity of the modern Italian school may be, the name of Mozart stil serves as a rallying point for a vast mnltitude, the existence of which is sarcely suspected tiU it is visibly demonstrated, and the announcement of DonGiovanzi 'will draw to an opera-house hundreds who would never be moved from their homes by the allurements of Verdi, or even of BeUini. On Saturday night this great! work was performed, for the second time, before a brilliant and numerous audience, among whom the Prince of Wales and Prince Alfred were conspicuous, and it is to be repeatod every evening thit week. The feeling that this revival is based on a reverence for Mozart that indluces a closer approximation both to his text and to the poem of Da Ponte is of no small value. This, stany rate, is not the conventional Don Gioranni either with xespect to the music or to tho stage arrangements. Signor Bonetti, the musical director, has gone back to the original score, restoring vocal pieces thathave been hitherto omitted, sndremovinginstramentsthatMozathimselfhadrepndi(tod Mr. Marshall, the scene painter, has reflected on the achion of the drama, and has produced a number of appropriate decorations, one of which-the bali-room, so fitted up as to allow of the famous combination ef dances-is likely to be. come the talk of the town as a briBliant " stage effect." Of the artists employed in the execution of the work nearly every one has made an advance in reputation by the sucoessful accomplishment of a new and arduous task. That the Zerlina of Mademoiselle Piccolomini would be a most fasoinating performanco everybodyexpected, but sucha perfect stamp of originalityastheyoung vocaisthas impressed upon the rustic damsel of SeviUe could scarcely have been anticipated. Instead of flinching from the rusticity of the character, she is determined to make the most of it. When she comes on the stage, dancing with her bridegroom, she allows herself no mincing gait, but jumps about withall the delight proper to a holyday, especialy when that holyday is occasioned by a young woman's own wedding. The duet " La ci darem" is accompanied by an odd wondering stare. Zorlina is highly flattered-nay, Ehe is captivated, but she cannot help marvelling that so fine a gentleman should take notice of her. Bat her great achievement is the delightful " Batti, bat4i" for the due ilustration of which she employs every single rule that the grammar of rural coquetry can supply. She smiles, she pats, she nudges with her elbow. When this routine has been oncea gone through without effect, she pouts, and then ahe smiles, pats, and nudges again. When the sternness of Masetto is at last overcome (and how could it possibly endure ?) her rush into his arms is one of the prettiest, heartiest things imaginabli. Great credit, moreover, is due to Signor Corsi for his acting of Masetto. In a natural manner he weas and ho put3 aside his jealous moodiness. From the first night of her appearanco MademoisUlle Spezia's advance has been unremitting. Into the character of Donna Anna she throws all her energy, which is no 5mall etock, and we do not often see a finer piece of acting on the lyrical stage than her delivery of the descriptive recitative that precedes the air, " Or sai che l?onore." By her performance in I Puritani Mademoiselle Ortolani had already proved the great flueney of a voice not naturaUy powerful, but the facility with which she executes the difficult music intrusted to Elvira has taken the public by sur. prise. Too often it has been tho custom so to cast the opera that Elvira becomes almost as great an infliction to the audience as to Giovanni himself, but now the deEerted fair one of Burgos is a pleasing personage. Signor Giuglini is, of course, welcome as Don Ottavio especially as he brings a new song with him; and Leporello is sung with conscientious correctness by that steadiest of artists, Signor Bdlletti, who, moreover, displays a considerable amount of humour in going through the business of the scene. Both as to voice and appearancoe Signor Vialetti is an imposing " man of stone;" but the artist 'who, on th3 whole, has caused thegreatest wonder is Signor Beneventano. who impersonates Don Giovanni himself, and of whom very little was expected. As we have long laid down the doctrine that the Spanish libertine is an almost unattainable ideal, we shall not depart from it in favour of Signor Beneventano, but certainly he gives a very gallant representation of the part, makes love and declares war with a full conviction of ultimate victory, and eats his supper with an air of princely Independence. The revival of Don Giovanni has assuredly proved a lucky throw for Signor Beneventano. * One of the greatest features in the performance is the ehorus Vira lna ibarta, That this may be executod with all efficiency Mr. Charles Braham, Herr Reichardt, Mademoiselle Fazio, Mademoiselle Poma, and the principal voealists are engaged rpon it, and the arrangement of the groups renders it.as striking to the eye as it is impressve to the earThis piece has become an established encore.
ST. JAMBS'S THEATBE. The old story on which was based the anecdote of Philip and Mena, related by Horace, in awell-known epistle (II., 7), and which has since passed through the hands of many moralists, who have been ready enough to assert that wealth is incompatible with happiness, without the slightest notion of carrying out theirown doctrine, save under such circumstances as make a virtue of necessity-this old story is rendered especially popular in France trom the fact that it wasselected by LaFontaine as the subject of one of his fables, among which (considerably modified) it holds a place as Le Financier a le Savctier. In a little eiece bearing the same title as this fable M. Hector Cremieun has mnost comically upset the moral of the ancient tale. ML Belazor, the financier, is not only annoyed at the constant singing of the poor and happy cobblerin his stall, but is furtheroffended by the audacity of the plebeian in asking him for the hand of his daughter Aub6pine. Atagand party given at his own house Bclazor consults his friends as to how he can get rid of his troublesomeneighboar,when he receives assudden ught fromIaFon. taine's fable, which, converted into an excellent comic song, is sung by his daughter. According to the most popular of instructors, he has only to give a sum of money to the cobbler and at once the happiness of the latter, with all the nuianceo appertaining to it, will cease. He therefore sends for him and makes him a present of 100 crowns. Alas for those who put their confidence in moral advisers!I The cobbler stakes his newly acquired money at lanspuenet, and is so lucky that he wins not only aU the fLnancier's wealth, but even the clothes on his back, as some slight compeistion for which he gives him his own vulgar habilimientg He can now boldly demand the hand of Aub6pine, which her father is glad enough to bestowr. This piece, which, like the last in the repertory of the CcBoufiW1 "ha been written with the utmost reverence for absurdityv is adrnirbly~,layed by MUI. Pradeau and Mesma&Cre andl Mademnoiselle Maresebal The dignity of the financier, as represented by M.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, Juvs 13. The coton cloth trade report a quiet market, bat thg. business of the week has been sufficient to relieve stockip considerably, and there is less pressure to sell where buyers, are unwilling to give the increased prices now asked formoat icinds of ahirtings, ndapolms, and jaconots. Yarns, are fully Id. and in some cam id. per lb. higher than lut weelk, witl a fair demnud for export; but there is a diffi. culty in finding purchasers for home trade yarns, and in. this branch of the market there is very little doinv. The, raw material, in addition to being -td. per lb. higher thau, last week, has been largely dealt in by speculatos, -an th. sales exceed a fortnight's consumption; but this fails to. quicken the spirits of buyers in the yarn and cloth market, where transactions are limited to the best requirements oe their trade, the high prices of goods, though unremunera, tive to the maker, operating against any dispoeition to- BIRMINGHAM, JBxE 13. The South Staffordshire iron trade continues uiet, withi a tendency towards a further advance in prices. T' arises, not from any particular increaae of orders, butfrom the facrt that most of the leading firms are weU employed upon old, contracts and are reluctant to euter upon fresh ones at existing rates. The demand fo. miine pigs continues to be great, and within the last fortnight there has been a coDa. derable advance in the quotations of best qualities;, vithirL which period they have fetched 41. 15s., and are now sai to be worth 51. per ton. The exports to America of Soatuh Staffordshire iron, especially of rails, are improving, and as the new tariff comes into operation during the ensuing. month a great fall trade is expected. From the neighbourhood of Dudley, the centre of the, various ironfoundry businesses, the reports made by ther principal firms are highly satisfactory. lany good contracts. are on hand, both for home and foreign requirements. Thea wrought nsi business is also unusually active, but the catn nail trade with the United States more particularly is represented as on the decline. The late reductions in the price of copper have not yet. p oduced any material effect upon the brassfoundry trade, of the town and neighbourhood. The demand for m -nufactured articles is limited, and the sales of metal dealer. proportionstely small. The tube manufacture is remarkably dul, one of the largest establishments inthetown notb employing their hands more than three days in the week. The cabinet braasfoundry branch continues active, but generally, although the tendency is towards improvemens other departments of the manufacture are not busy. The country trade in generl hardware is said to be im. proving. The order sheets received by factors' houses who! have travellers in Ireland and Scotland exhibit a better de. mand, and fo- tin and Britannia metal wares the orders are more than usually large. Good orders have been received during the week for Birmingham manufactures from Australia and SoutlxAmerica, and from the continent of Europe there are indications of a greatly improved trade. LEEDS, JVu;E 13. The state of the woollen cloth trade may be reportde rather better. There has been rather more doing mn the warehouses. Several London buyers have been down, and a. few from the country, but their purchases have only been made on a moderate scale. The prices offered are in marycases such as holders refuse to accept, and sales we cons, - quently checked. Manufacturers are rather better emplopct than they have lately been, There are some pretty fairorders in hand for the better elass goods, as well as for atonat heavy goods, some of the merchants having begun to give. out their winter orders. Still, there are several districts in which employment is far from brisk, without any immediate. prospect of improvement. The hail markets have been wdiattended tbis morning; a somewbatfirm tone prevailed, and, a tolerably good business was toasacted. In wool bat little has passed during the week, manufacturers confining theirpurch sestomeettheirimmediatewbants Someofthelo^at wool fairs have been held within the past few days. Ae Selby there was a large show of wool, and a good attendance, of buyer Sales were effected at 20s 9d. to 22s. per stone - 94 sheets were disposed of at these prices There was a lar,;e= attendance of both buyers and sellers at the York woolmarket on Thursday last, but owing to the inclement state or the weather a great quantity of wool remained unsold. Prices exhibited a downward tendency. At Northallerton. wool-market the folowing prices were realized --Poor ewe Is. 2d. per pound; half-bred, ls. 2d to ls 3d.; good eweIs. 3d.; hog and ewe, s 4d.; two-third hog, Is 5d.; prime. hog, ls. 6d. NOTTINGHAM, JTuE 13. The lacw trade is in a quiet state. There are some foreign, buyers in the market, but their operations are not extbnsive. Silk and yarns continue at a very high price, and manufacturers are careful in not producing much stock There is not much doing in hosiery, most branches being: dulL Both home and foreign demands are ouiet. A new invention in the manufacture ef &rawers has been. introduced and registered by the firm of Faun and Lamb,. the improvement being the dispensing with the usual bandl at the waist. The drawers appear shaped to fall in over tho, hips, and may be worn with trousers without braces. BRADFORD, JuiE 13, The improvement observable last vweek in the demand forworsted piece goods is continued. Business is steady for export, and a good number of orders have been given out, more numerous, however, than extensive. Home housesare not so weeU employed. Prices remain as of late, and itis anticipated that they will experience no reduction. There is no variation of importance to report inl the yarn. department. The spinners accept contracts with very con. siderable caution, as the prices offered are anything but; satisfactory, although the offers are numerous. Cotton warps are frm, withoutmuchbusiness doing, The wool-market is quiet. The business entered into. for combing descriptions is narrowed to the limit absolutely required to fulfil the present consumption in the trade - w state of thinRs that has ruled for some time past LAte prices are fully supported. A prevalent opinion is that it operations are not made to a larger extent prices will recede. It is aserted, however, on the other hand, that ful currencies are obtained by the farmers for the new clip. Clothing wools on offer in our market are disposed of readily, and command full rates. NtORWICH, Jusx 13. The manufacturing trade continues rather dull, and has derived but little activity yet from the autumn orders. Altogether it is stated to be more backward than at the: corresponding period of last year. A mixed lamb's wool fabric for dresses similar to that manufactured for last autumn is being proceeded with; some is also being made for trousers, &c. The shoe trade is stil active, and a fair amount of basiness is doing with the Australian colonies. The price oE leather stiU keeps up, and if liberal orders are received a, further advance is not regarded as improbable. Upw-rds. of 6,000 men, women, and children are now employed in the manufacture of boots and shoes in Norwich. HALIFAX, J1U. 13. The staple trade of this town wears a quiet aspect, buLt it. has rather improved during the week, a fair amount oi business having been done in damasks, Orleans, and lastings. As stocks have increasd for some weeks, and there appears; no prospect of much increase in the demand, manufac. turers are begmmngD to work shorter hours or otherwise to. bring their productive powers into less compass. In spitaof these things wools command ful prices, and there is nolarge quantity in the market beyond the current demand.

jfONEY-MARBKTand CITYINTBL-GE2VCE. Saturday Evenin. [n the face of the favourable returne of the Bank X Fr=ance and the Bank of England and a rise within the last tnwo days of more than one per cent. cn the Paris Bour.e the funds to-day have been vl-olly without animation, the prices of yesterday ibeig feebly supported and the market elosing witth genoral symptoms of dulness. Consols for the 9th ,of July were quioted 931 to k ex dividend. She operations of the publieconsisted chiefly of .salea, while the speculators continued to buy, but the extent of business was unimportant. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92g to ; New Three per Cents., 92i to ;-; Exchequerlbonds, 982 to J; India-bonds, 8s. to 4s. dis-count; and Exchequer-bill, 2s. diacount to 2s. j,i emium. Foreign securities have exhibited little variation, the operations generally having been limited. 'Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 956, i, and 3', and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 1(ljl; Brazilian Four-and-a.Hslf per Cents., i7k; New Granada Active, 22i; the Deferred, 61; Greek, &'; Mexican Three per Cents., 22k; Portuguese Three per Cents., 40-; Sardinian Five per -Cents., 89; and Spanisn Certificates of Coupon mot funded, 64. A further sum of about 32,0001. inAustralian gold -was sold to the Bank to-day, making the total taken there during the week nearly 400,0l)0l. The final quotations of the French Three per ,Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. for money and 69f. 25c. for the end of the month, ahowing a further improvement of a half per cent. Consequent, it is supposed, on the anticipations regarding the effect to be produced by the proposed issue of 21. notes, and also perhaps, on the receipt of rather less unfavourabie accounts of the silk crop. The private letters from Paris to-day state that 'the question of reducing the rate of discount was not even mentioned at the last meeting of the -directors, on Thursday. It is probable, however, -hat this was simply in consequence of the formalities connected with the installation of the new -Governor. The accounts from the provinces regarding the prospect of the grain harvest are all exceedingly satisfactory. Letters from Turin mention that the new law ;allowing the National Bank of Piedmont to increase -their rate of interest was promulgated on Monday last, and that the bank immediately adopted an advance to 7 per cent. The bank at Genoa forthwith took a similar step, and it seems to be contemplated that a further rise may be found necessary to stop -he efflux of bullion. The general result of the European and Asiatic a1ilk crop can nVow be approximately estimated, and -according to advices from M. Arles Dufour, of lyons, dated yesterday, it is likely to prove better than was at one time anticipated. From a r6sum6 which he furnishes the followiing statements are gathered respecting each of the producing countries. 'The news from Turkey and Greece is as favourable as possible. At Naples the first crop, although reduced to one-half, is much better than last year. In Sicily and Calabria the prospects were encouraging, but the latest advices announce that at their fourth stace the worms have become severely affected. In -Spain there is only half a normal crop, but it is still much better than the last, both as regards quantity and quality. In Tuscany and the Roman States -appearances are very promising. From Lombardy it is stated that in the districts of Brianzia, Brescia, 13ergamo, and the lower Tyrol the seed has not succeeded, and the produce will be very poor; 'bbut that in the Frioul and the high Tyrol all is going on most satisfactorily. In Piedmont there are general complaints, but the results are much better than those of last season. In France, also, which next to China and Lombardy isthe richest silkproducing country in the world, it is now believed the yield, notwithstanding all drawbacks, will be superior to that of 1856. M. Dufour adds that, assisted by the generally favourable temperature the crop, but for the disease in the seed, would have been marvellous. This persevering malady, he considers, had its origin in the bad food which the 'worms have received during six or seven years of mnoist and warm winters followe(d by harsh springs; -and, as the season has now returned to a natural -character, the hope is entertained of gradual improvement. The accotmts from New Zealand by the Australian mail yesterday show that the existence of a xemunerative goldfield in that colony is no longer -doubtful. Mines have been discovered in the Aorere Valley, near Nelson, and a number of persons liad flocked to them during the month preceding the date of the present letters. The total number on the spot had reached 300, and the yield -of the week ending the 20th of March was over 2U0 ounces. According to the advices by the Brazil mail this afternoon the Governmenlt Bank at Rio have at length been compelled to raise their rate of discounit to 9 per cent., after having for some time past resorted to expedients for procuring gold ausalogous to those adopted during the past year by the Bank of France. The sugar crop, it 'was thought, will next season be large, notwithstanding the appearance of some wnfavourable symptoms. From the River Plate the ac-counts chiefly relate to the fever which has decimated the city of Montevideo, but which at the departure of the mail was beginning to subside. It appears that, takiiug advantage of the pretext of Leavy expenses having been thrown upon them by this visitation, the Montevidean Governmnent formed a project for stopping the monthly payanents from the Custom-house which they are bound inider a recent treaty to make to certain English creditors, and that they took courage to puit it in force immediately upon receipt of the news that Lord Palmerston had been defeated and might possibly be conipelled to resign. The annexed mercarntile letter gives the latest details:- " eMontevideo, May 3. "Up to witbin a few boun the fever has continued its Tavages without abatement, notwitbstanding five or six *days cold weather, wi h bracing winds from the southward aLd westward. In fact, during the prevalence of the cold the deaths ra her increased. Few of those who were ill when it first came on escaped, and on one day it is said the nortality reached CO. Upwards of 1,500 deaths haveoccurred from fever since it broke out in February. Many cases have teiminated rapidly, and I have to record the loss of another Englishman-an old gentleman who came out to the ltiver Slate a year or two ago-Mr. Colquhoun, engineer. 3le had charge of the gasworks, which are sitaated in the immediate neighbourhood of the most infected part. IThere is no evidence that the fever Is contagious, but such is the terror of the people throughout the country that in several of the villages and towns far in the interior people are not permitted to enter until they have undergone an examiination. Lime has been liberally thrown over the heaps of filth from which thore can be no doubt the fever originated; and when the sun ceases to be so powerful measames are to be adopted to re3move what ought never to have been deposited in the town. The Junta Economica, a substitute for our muunicipal corporations, is making itself useful, and charitable contributions in aid of the poor are subscribed, bet owing to so nmany of the wealthier inhabitants having left the city the amount is not considerable. I am sorry to say that littlc or nothing has been subscribed by those who reside in the country. The inhabitants of Buenos Ayres have been more generous, and have remitted several thousand dollars. Per- laps the population of this unfortunate city is at present nzot more than one-third what it was in January. The streets appear forsaken; a great many of the shops are closed. The deaths have been principaDy among the French and itsalans ; but this is easily accounted for, as they are the ebief artisans, and labourers, and boatmen, and have un-foztunately congregated too closely together. It must not be inferred that Montevideo is an unhealthy place generally, and I think there can be little doubt, if proper attention be paid to drainage and cleanliness, it vill never again saffer such another visitation as now unhappily exists. " Taking advantage of the general terror that prevails, -the Government proposed to the Chambers to suspend the payments of all claims on the revenue under contracts, and the proosition has been sanctioned by law. The plea is extraor inary disbursements are required in consequence of the fever, but these can be estimated and means could be provided to meet them. They consist of compensation to the owners of several wooden houses that have been burnt by order of the Government,-and the expeose of removing -the heaps of filth which have caused the calamity. The Ministers of Government, however, want to handle funds -sore considerable portion of which may stick to their fingers. The various claimants whose contracts are now suspended offered to contribute a portion of their monthly receipts, and they riahtly considered town property should he taxed to pay its share, which ought not to be incoasiderable; but they required that the money should he disbursed in no othe: manner than that for which it wvas proposed to be raised, and by a commission of respectable citizens. These stipulations were not pleasing to the Government, but that they were not unreasonable will be seen from the fact that Last year a law paEsed levying 2 per mil on real Droperty and capital, to be especialy applied in liquidation, of the national debt, but not one farthing has been so appropriated. The guazanteed loan contractors, with the sanction of Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Thornton, offered to contribute with the others a portion of their receipts, but that would not answer the purpoe of:the Government. They are novr in a coitionto suspend (i e., an,nul) the contract wheneverthey ink proper. Tbis contract a made between Her sjest'COhorge dAffaires (sanctioned by Lord Clarendon) ll i X Govq~ent wd apWrovel4 byv ge Clshnbe It is therefore au international contraot. It was extremely favourable to the hlontovidean Government, as from its d4te Al1 interest ceased, and double the number of years were OsMumed to pay it off than they were entitled to. But what care these people about international contraots or anything else that bears the cbaracter of good faith? Previously to the arrival of the last mail it was doubtful ir the Chamb er would sanction the Government proposal; but when it was ascertained there was to be a dissolution of ParliaMeDt it was hastily assumed that Lord Palmerston would go out of office, and that his successor would not trouble himself about mattersin tbe River Plate. I need not say tbat Lard Palmerston is looked upon as an B3gEish Minister here as in England. But should his Lordship go out of office it is not likely any successor would so far neglect British interests as to sanction such spoliation as is contemplated. "From Buenos Ayres we hear little; owing to the de. parturo of the steamers Pampero and Menai for England, our communication is very irregular, and the quarantine regulations render it still more difficult. We hear, however, that the Indians have committed serious depredations, and have carried off many captives and large droves of cattle. Rosas subsidized them largely, buthis successors in power have considered it derogatory to their dignity to do so. Exchange, 73s. the doubloon." The railway neetings of the week have been Iwvvholly unimportasnt. The shareholders of the F1 urness Railway have sanctioned a Bill authorizing the constructionofaline from near Broughton to Coniston. Powers were given to the Furness Company to subscribe towards the undertaking, and to enter into working arrangements with the new company. At the Hartlepool meeting the Bill for an amalgamation with the North-Eastern Company was agreed to. At a mneeting of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, held this morning, Mr. W. Brown, M.P., in the ebair, the provisions of the Bill before Parliament were discussed and approved. A transaction was to-day recorded in the shares at 450, and the quotation on 6001. paid is 80 to 40 discount. The annexed information relative to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the Midifg JournI:- "The market is quiet, and for a few of the progressive descriptions there has been a demand. At Dolcoath meet. ing the accounts showed a balance in favour of advanturers of 2,2081.; a dividend of 71 Iper share was declared.

At Withiel United Copper and Iron meeting the accounts showed a balance a"ainst adventurers of 1161. At Rickeard's Wheal Rose meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of l5s." With regard to foreign mining the following is the only paragraph worthy of extract:- "ABt the A nglo-Californian Gold meeting it was agreed that the company should be dissolved. At the Copiapo meeting the report of the directors stated that there had been a falling off in the silver mines, though the loss that had accrued there had amounted to less than 3001. At Checo copper mine an important discovery had been made, the lode thereproducing ornm seven to eight tons of ore per fathom, of the value of 25 per cent. and upwards. The directors strongly recommend the necessity of smelting on the spot, in order that they may be able to reduce poor ores, which would not bear the expense of freight, as well as to obtain the smelting and profits on the richer sorts. The directors of the St. Jobn Del Rey Company have received advices by the steamer Teviot from Brazil, dated the 30th of April, showing the proeduce for the month of March to be 23,085 oitaves of gold from 7,197 tons of stone, and no profit."
THE LIOBNSING SYSTEM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is a remarkable circumstance that, although the great brewers, of whom there are a considerable number in the House of Commons, must thoroughly understand the working of the licensing system, not one of the many who were present during the debate of last Wednesday thouight fit to address the House. But Mr. Charles Buxton, who happened to be absent from that debate, now writes to you to say that had he been present he should have answered Mr. KCer Seymer, and should have contradicted Mr. Seymer's alegation that the London publicans are generally under the control of the London brewers. iMr. Buxton observes that on that point he can speak positively so far as his own firm is concerned, and that he is convinced that all the other London brewers act on the same system. He then goes on to explain that, although Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, Buxton, and Co. have made advances of money to many of their publicans, the borrowers are in no degree bound to deal with them in consequence of these loans, "as they can be paid of$ at any moment by any other brewer to whom the publican chooses to apply." It happens, however, that, although the great Lcndon brewers have been as chaiy of defending their monopoly in person as witnesses before committees as they have been of addressing the House in its vindication, one of them did venture to appear before Mr. Charles Viliers's committee. It happens, too, oddly enough, that this witness was MIr. Charles Buxton's ow n partner, Mr. Robert Hanbury. MIr. Hanbury was examined upon the very point on which Mr. Buxton has written to you. He was asl]ed on what terms brewers usually made loans to publicans. He answered that the borrower was required to deposit his deeds with the lender, there being "an implied understanding that the latter should deal with the brewer whose money he borrowed." In answer to question 5,514 Mr. Hanbury said, "When the customer of another brewer comes to us and tells us that he is under any obligation to another brewer, we do not supply him until he pays off his obligation to the other brewer." This, according to Mr. Robert Hanbury, is the practice of Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, Buxton, and Co., and Mr. Bux;ton tells us in his letter to you that all the other London brewers act on the same principle. Yet MIr. Buxton wishes us to believe that th,. contrary is the case, and that Mr. Ker Seymer, although entirely supported in his statements by Mr. Robert Hanbury, is unworthy of credit. "W Who shall believe when partners disagree ?" Mr. Hardy's Bill having been thrown out, I will only make a single remark upon it. In the very able speech which Mr. Hardy made he entirely pretermitted one point to which the beer drinkers of Eingland not unreasonably attach some importance. He made no alusion whatever to the interests of the consumer; he appeared to consider the price and quality of the liquor to be supplied to the public by the monopolists in whose support he struggled so skilfully as a matter of no moment whatever. yhen a trade is free and open, it is for the consumer to take care of himself; but when a Government insists that it is its duty to step in, in Iaco pcaresrs as it were, regulate the supply of an article, and decide upon the parties who alone are to retail it, then, 1 submit, the consumer has a clear right to demand that its officious guardian shall also be responsible for its good quality and its reasonable price. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A THXITY $OUI4 Ize 1.
RAiLWAY AND jiR7NG -S--R-. Saturday Evening. The railway-market is firm, and prices further advanced from 5s. to lOs. per share. The principal movement was in Caledonian, London and NorthWestern, and North-Eastern, purchases having steadily increased.

There has been a considerable aggregate falU of rain thiaweek, whichb haa been highbly beneficial, clearing the 7oung turnip plant, which has just begun to make Its appearance, from the fly with which it hadbeen in many places asailed. The appearance of the wheat crops is everywhere astisfactory. with the exceplon that there is almo3t too much plaut on the beattilled gronde.

LONDON, MORDA Y, JUyE 15, 1857. What an amusingly inconsistent animal JoHN BI, is! He is everything, not only by turns,but all at once. He is at one and the same time a democrat and a courtier-a sturdy independent and a tufthunter-an admirer of Saxon institutions and 'the 'victim of the first foreign Count that comes in his way. We talk of our mixed Constitution -our QunN, Lords, and Commons,-and think what a pity it is that so unique and delicate a piece of machinery should ever be spoilt or lost. Nofear of that. The British Constitution will never be broken up and sold for old brass to the dealers in marine stores so long as JoHN BULL himself remains. As the coral worm makes the coral reef, JORN BULL makes the British Constitution, being QunuN, Lords, Commons, and everything in himself. Were the five pointe of the Charter to pass in all their savage integrity next Session, before ten years were over Court influence, the aristocracy, flunkeyism, and all the rest of it would be more rampant than ever. Our most distinguished and incorruptible Radicals would be either glistering in gold lace or flying to the United States. But it is the money teat which brings out most the glorious inconsistency of the Englishman. ARisToTIoE, simple man ! divided spenders, as he did Governments, into classes. He imagined the spendthrift and the screw; the careless spender, the pompous spender, and the really liberal man. JoHN BuTLL is all these in one; at least, it is a rare thing to find a man who is not. Indeed, we cannot help ourselves. Every man is a bundle of habits, and haa as many habits in the one matter of personal expenditure as he has clothes in his wardrobe. Sometimes he is on the narrow gauge, sometimes on the broad gaugee; but, on whatever gauge he finds himself, he has no choice but to go on. " To maintain " an equable expenditure," says Lord ESx:DmI, on Mr. DISABxL's authority, " not to spend too "much on one thing, too little on another, is an "art. There must be a harmony, a keeping in "disbursement, which few men have " There is old FoGoo in his study, arranging his old boots and shoes, airing his gaiters, examining his dresscoat, a quarter of a century old, while he is paying with just parental pride his son's bill for 3501. at the military tailoes foruniforms already out of date. JoHw BuLL ruins a cabman for an overcharge of sipence, consigning him to prison and his wife and children to the workhouse, on the very same day that he sends a five-pound note by post to some begging-letter impostor -whom he never saw or heard of, and whom, after all, he only half believes. The same rational character wearies himself to death with trudging over hard pavements, amid incesant rattle and clatter, at ihe very time that his stables are full of plethoric horses and mouldering carriages, and when his steward, his bailiff, his butler, and even his groom, would as soon think of flying as of walking half a mile. He is plotting to save half-a-crown when he is spending ten or twenty pounds a-day on some hobby that he will tire of before it is done. His friends are all saying, "How il he dresses," when his Christmas bill for liveries would keep him at the top of the fashion for every year of his life. On these points an Englishman's absurdity is so great that one can only imagine him the victim of a special law, the intention of which is at the same time to confound his pride and to keep him always poor, so that he shall spend aU his money, and yet have nothing to show for it. We set down, then, to the national insanity, not to mere baseness, the series of cavils made at numerous praiseworthy and indeed necessary items of the national expenditure on Friday night. The people who have compelled Governments to throw a large portion of the cost of the County and Borough Police, the cost of the County Courts, of criminal prosecutions, of the maintenance of prisoners, and ever so many other like items upon the Exchequer, and who do not stick a moment at a few hundreds of thousands for harbours of problematic utility, cannot be set down as stingy on principle. On the contrary, they are the worst spendthrifts. They are like TISONw, who forgot that the world itself was but a word, and, if the world were his own, would some day say the word and give it away. In fact, that appears to be the only rule of the House. Reduce a thing as much as possible to a word, toll people nothing about it, bid them shut their eyes and ears to the application of the money, and they will vote half a milion without a moment's thought. TeU them conscientiously what it is for; spend it under their own eyes, their own ears, and even their very noses; give them maps, plans, names, estimates, pounds, shillings, and pence, good authorities, and definite objects; reason with them, preach to them, persuade them; win over their wives, their children, their friends, and their servants to your side; move Haeaven and earth for the cause, and, above all, let the cost be a trifle, and their whole nature wiU be roused into dogged and vindictive parsimony. If they cannot for shame refuse the money, they will never cease to grumble about it and throw it in your teeth. In fact, it addresses itself to their apprehensions. It is too useful and too conspicuous. Its notorious and flagrant utility is its offence. Sbroud it in some official cloud; relegate it to some remote region; bury it in figures; lump it in a round sum, and JOHN BULr will swallow and even digest it. He is a good beast of burden, but rather apt to shy. So you must give him blinkers. He'd rather draw a stage-coach, six inside, fourteen out, ten miles an hour, so long as he does not see it, than take " Missus" and her baby a gentle airing in the open carriage six miles an hour, if he is allowed a glimpse of the rattletrap at his heels. How, also, except on the theory of a morbid, yet truly national inconsistency, are we to account for the objections made on Friday to a succession of Votes recommended by their useful, salutary, ornamental, and comparatively inexpensive character ? There is the lake in St. James's Park. Nobody disputes that it ought to be kept up in its original character as an ornamental lake of pure water, and not as a stagnant and offensive pond. Who, then, is to pay for it ? In the first place, the question is settled on principle, for the lake is in a Royal Pprk, in the hands of a public department. But that is not all. This lake, with all its salubrious or deleterious influences, is surrounded by a circle of buildingg almost wholly palaces and public offices, or private houses belonging to the CRow. It has within little more than a hundred yards of its banks Buckingham Palace, St. James's Palace, Clarence-house, Marlborough-house, the future residene of the Prince of WALES; Sutherland-house, leaed from the CRowN; the Ordnance-office, the Admiralty, the Horse Guards, the Foreign-office, the Treasury, the ourd of 'Trade, the Home- office, the Duchy of Cornwall, a very extensive range of barracks, and about a dozen offices of subordinate departments of Government, at which a great number of gentlemen have to sit at desks the greater part of the day. There are also about a dozen clubhouses, generally on CRowN land, sufficiently near the lake to be reached by a miasma from it on the prevalent wind. It would not be easy to imagine a more national affair. That it is also the most popular lake in this country, within a few hundred yards of the densest parts of the metropolis, and that all foreigners tell us St. James's Park is the prettiest thing of the kind we have, may not be to the purpose, which is simply whether the lake is a national-not a purely local affair. Yet, on Friday night a number of country gentlemen, to the disgrace of their order, could get up and twaddle against the extravagance of spending the public money in purifying the waters of the lake-the very same gentlemen who would mob the House next week to throw on I the public purse a million a-year, if they could, of their own local, that is, provincial expenditurewho, if they could, would compel Government to give every one of them a map of his estate on any scale he might prefer at the public expense. For our part, we have no objection to the most sigo. rously scientific inquiry into the respective provinces of national and local expenditure. The sooner it is found out who ought to do and pay for the improvements now in progress or wanted in this metropolis, the better; but, as things nowr are, it seems to us a course which we hardly ventare to characterize to cavil at the improvements in St. James's Park, at the formation of Battersea Park, at the money spent on Hampton Court, Bushy Park, and Kew-gardens, after throwing on the public purse County Police, County Prisoners, County Lunatics, County Court Fees, County everything, as the only condition of not stopping public business altogether, and making Parliament as mere a name as some other institations of the country.
Even absolute power, based upon half-a-million of bayonets, made confident by a successful war and a politic diplomacy, supported by the instinct of bourse and bourgeoisie, must sometimes in these days condescend to a public appeal. The Moniteur has just published its obituary notice of the late legislative Assembly. To influence the elections which are at hand is, of course, the object of this manifesto; but the Government of NAPOLEON IIL would seem to aim at something more general than to, reward meritorious representatives by its praise, and to stimulate electors to return men of similar qualities to the new Assembly. The Moniteur's remarks form a defence of French institutions as they exist at the present hour. We are accustomed to this. Our neighbours always have the notion that the advent of their last new Constitution is the beginning of civilization among mankind. The first Republic talked of the old regime as we should talk of the days of TuBAL CAm-; under the Consulate the Directory was all that was contemptible and ridiculous; by the time the first NAPOL,EON was crowned the wits made themselves merry with the very notion of Consuls. Under the Restoration a legitimate constitutional King was proclaimed the noblest of institutions, and equal adulation has been heaped on aU that LoUIs PHILIPPE, that LEDPu RoWiN, and that CAVAIGNAc have successively introduced. Every man has been worshipped up to the moment of his fall, and then trampled upon or forgotten. The fate of French rulers has been the reverse of an apotheosis. Similar has been the lot of the various constitutions. The French have always appeared possessed with the idea that to overthrow the whole fabric ot society is a brilliant exploit, and to change all that has been established a few years before a proof of consummate wisdom. Like those jllconditionedconvertswho have nosooner leftaChurch than they hasten on to a public platform to sneer at and ridicule all that they had formerly believed, SO Paris no sooner upsets or acquiesces in the upsetting of a Government than it follows its former idols with invective, which, if deserved, only shows how discreditable must have been its formereulogies. The Moniteur is still striking the note which it has sounded ever since 1851. It cannot leave the National Assembly alone. It is not enough that this unfortunate body expiated its many faults of taste and temper by the most terrible indignities, that its members were seized and carried off from its place of meeting, that its existence was forcibly terminated by an. edict unwarranted by law, that many of its number are pining in London suburbs or in garrets at Drussels, and more than one has met his end in the swamps of Cayenne or lingered year after year under supervision inAlgeria. Praise of the Imperial Legislature would still be incomplete without a sneer at anything which derived its authority from a Republic. " The "Legislature," says the official organ, " received "the thanks of the Esnlnon ; it deserves those of "France." It was " elected at the close of a "period when the abuse of speech and the omni"potence of Asemblies had brought society to the "brink of a precipice." " Within a period of "five years, and with Sessions of three or four "months' duration, the late Legislature has done "more than our former assemblies would have "done in 10 years of endless sessions." It felt that its duty was "not to obstruct, but to " help the saviour of France." Such is the contrast which the Mo01iteur draws between the obscure and faineant body which has just been dissolved and the Chambers which listened to the eloquence of GUIZOT and TnmIus, XoNTAI.IBERT and L.LAnRTIZE. One thing even an Imperial Government cannot carry on well, and that is political discusion. The supporters of the Mfoniitr are likely to produce much more effect by " warnings"' than by repartee. If the press of France were free it might be disposed to answer that the alleged achievements cf the Legislature are not the only, nor even the highest, which are demanded of representatives. The Legislative Body has passed 240 public and 739 private Bills in its five years. Almost all of these related to the authorization of public works. It has effected loans for building in Paris and the provinces. It has warmly supported the generous measures of the EnrPsRo to give relief to those suffering from famine and inundations, " to give work to the poor, to increase the " funds of the hospitals and charitable institutions." It has lent 100,000,000 of francs for drainage, it has granted money for the Rue de Rivoli, the Boulevard de Sebastopol, and the Bois de Boulogne; thus " powerfully contributing to "wonders which are the glory of the present reign, "the admiration and envy of strangers." It supported the EMPiZRoB in his new schemes of finance, particularly with respect to the National Loan. It has authorized all but a few of the great trunk lines of railroad in France. This list of labours gives us a clear notion of the character of the Imperial Legislature. It is suggestive both by what it contains and what it omits. A body which is perfectly quiet and well ordered, which meets for a short term yearly, which has few debates, which admits only the slightest differences of opinion, and which gives its sanction to a large number of BiMS-all relating to material improvementsmay no doubt be a serviceable institution in its way, but -it is not a reprewntative assembly of the people in the sense in which the English and Americans understand, and the French themselves, aix years ago, iiderstood representative Assemblies. In fact, theirperial Legislature meets but to register the plans of the Emwrnop and his MIinisters A Change may here and there be respectfully suggested in some project of law for a loan or a canal, but on the whole the Assembly has neither liberty nor authority, and is consequently a mere political lifein-death. While, therefore, we fully recognize the benefits conferred on France by the present EMIP.nO, and believe that the material improvements of the last few years reflect the highest credit on the administration of his Government, yet we cannot admit that a subservient Assembly has had any share in them. They have not been initiated within its walls. They would go on as usual if its doors were closed tomorrow. The truth must be told. The present is a time of great material progress in France- the Govermment has wisely and patriotically performed its task of direction and encouragement, but it has been by a centralized and absolute administration. This phantoom of a free Asseribly which still ha,unts the old legialative halls has been for nothing in the work. We should hardly have thought it necemary to dwell on this subject were it not that the Monitetur thinks proper to aim a blow at our own institutions. It is characteristic of the people that after having changed their form of government some dozen times witbin the last 70 years, they have the confidence not only to proclaim the superiority of their five-year-oldbantling to all its own predecessors, but even to the venerable fabric which has lated six centuries in these islands andl been the model for aU the free nations of the earth. The official writer says of the defunct Leggislature that, " while making less noise than "many other deliberative assemblies, it has "all the better answered its calling, and "taken a greater share in all the good that has "been done during that memorable period. "Deprived of the dangerous power of making and "unmaking binistries, of obstructing the march "of Government, and of transforming the Tribune "into a pedestal for ambition or vanity, the "Legislative Body was enabled to deliberate " on the Bills before it without the "stir of political passions and in the most per"fect independence of the Government as of "faction." Again, we are told how happily it had " lost the right of proposing in the midst of "debates amendments which often spoil the whole "tenour of a Bill." There is no mistaking such insinuations. We have before been told that the Imperial institutions were perfect, since they were " representation unalloyed "with Parliamentarism," but now we have the same notion on official authority. It has all along been the argument of the present system'a supporters that such a constitution as prevails in France allows more rapid legislation than our own. They do not see, or they affect not to see, that the facility with which measures are passed is a proof of the absence of aU independent authority. There is so ready an agreement because there is so much indifference. Hence, thoughno onecan be blind to the delays and blunders of our own House of Commons, an excellent example of which was given on Friday night, yet we would nob exchange its form of proceeding for any which would hamper the free play of individual judgment. It is needless, however, to discuss the subject in England, where there is lik-ely to be but one opinion. We would rather warn those supporters of the Imperial sway who look with complacency on an obedient Legislature that it may learn the habit of being too consistent in subservience to the powers that be, and that a time may come when they will regret that they taught a Legislative Body that devotion to existing authority was the highest of Senatorial and patriotic virtues.
On Wednesday last, as our columns have already informed the public, a deputation waited on the PBm MrNsTvg to submit certain propositions for an improved action of European Governments in the matter of the Slave Trade. It is certainlyhigh time that such improvement should be attempted. In the British West Indian Islands, -where the abolition of slavery has been a reality, our planters have seen a depreciation of their property emounting to little less than ruin. In the Spanish Settlements, notwithstanding the engagements of their authorities to suppress the Slave Trade, it is prosecuted with shameless persistency, and with a result most unjust to our own colonists. In Africa the demand for slaves thus maintained is perpetuating all the unspeakable atrocities of the traffic; and in Brazil, where the trade has been suspended, the acceptance of this betterpolicy has been, we are told, so involuntary that it is only to be measured by the continuance of the same compulsion which produced it. Such universal miscarriage must needs point to some defect of principle in the proceedings adopted, and this defect we explained the other day. It has now been enlarged upon by the arguments of the deputation to which we refer, and suggestions towards a remedy have been offered in so practical a form as to elicit the acknowledgments of Lord PAlMESTON himself. One of these suggestions recommends the obvious experiment of extending our blockade from the shores of Africa to the comparatively circumscribed coasts of Cuba itself; another very reasonably advises the removal from Cuba to Jamaica of that Court by which Slave Trade cases are tried. In a country where the whole policy of suppression is regarded with hostility it must evidently be difficult to conduct these trials successfully; besides which, there is no security for those negroes who ate released from captured slave-ships, and who sink into slavery almost as inevitably as if they had been sold into it at once. It was proDosed, accordingly, that tbis preventive service off the Cuban coast should be intrusted to some of our gunboats, and on this suggestion the PaRor MumrBrs appeared to look with favour. On another proposition he expressed himself with considerably greater hesitation; and yet this, we are convinced, is the point on which the successful prosecution of our policy will be found to turn. We remarked on a recent occasion-and our opinions were echoed in the arguments employed by the deputation-that it must necessarily be difficult to extinguish a supply where no other provision is made for a strong and recognized demand. Europe requires sugar, coffee, and rice. The West Indies can send us these commodities, but to do so they must have labour. Such labour was formerly provided by imports of slaves from Africa, but this traffic we have striven to abolish-successfully at some points, unsuccessfully at others. As long, however, as the supply of labour is considered identical with the supply of slaves it is clear that the Slave Trade will struggle for existence. Plantera will not let their estates go out of cultivation without an effort; but, if they could be enabled to calculate on the labour they need in any other shape, the work of suppression might be completely accomplished. As things stand, it is slave labour or noching; and it was to the substitution of some alternative more agreeable and promising than this that the proposal of the deputation tended. In a few words, the suggestion was to this1 effect,-that the Slave Trade should bo abolished through the abolition of slavery itself, and that slavery should be abolished by the employment of free labour obtained from the same markets. Recognize at once the, wants of tropical agrioulturists, and the capacity and aptitude of the blacks; establish emigration agencies in Africas provide suitable vessels for the passage, make voluntary contracts, see to proper facilities of return, get the services of the African on fair conditions, and so drive slavery out of the field altogether by putting an end to the exigencies which maintain it;-such was the proposal of the deputation, and, though we are not insensible to the difficulties in the way, wethink it coutains the germs of sound and successful policy. Take first the interest of the planter, fairly considered. A slave costs about 1401. ; a fee black emigrant could be landed in theWest Indies for about 71. lOs., leaving a difference in the first price large enough to cover an infinity of minor expenses. In fact, as regards outlay, there is no doubt that the balance would be in favour of free labour. At some of the seasons of urgency it is possible that a planter might niss that powerof operation.which an absolute command ove 1the bodk5 oX hIis slave- insured, buit against this consideration how many others mat' be set I There would be no fear of disturbances or insurrections, no smouldering fire under the surface of things ready at any moment to' explode in devastation and havoc, There would be;'no danger of intercepted supplies, such as the i- creased efficiency of the preventive squadron might at any time bring about, or the policy of the' Supreme Government occasion. All would be lawful, regular, and certain. At present the Cuban planters must needs feel that they are under the perpetual risk of losing those importations on rhich they depend..indeed, the proposed employmentof the gunboat mayperhaps go fartorardcproducing such a result; whereas, when free emigration is once established auch perils will cease. In Africathe consequencea of such a system might be bene-. ficial in the extreme. A captives would nolonger be saleable it is reasonable to expect they would no~ longer be made, and with the motives thus removed would be removed also the principal causes of intestine war. Then, again, it would be scarcely possible to imagine Proreedings better calculated for the ultinmate civilization and conversion of the; whole African race. The substitution of a lawful, safe, and well-frequented highway for the dreadful middle passage, the establishment of recog-^ nized agencies on African territory, the returu, of free blacks to their country after intercourse and familiarity with more civilize, races andhabits,-all these things would tend necessarily to, bring the Africans out of their isolation, and to open to missionaries and traders regioi u now visited only by murderers, Iddnappers, or adventurous travellers. From this point of view, indeed, the prospects are as encouraging as they could be. The chief difficulty, of course, would lie in the preparation of the country which was to receive free immigrants in the place of imported slaves for it iB manifest that the very first condition at this point must be the emancipation of the slaves already possessed. uInless this condition were fulfilled the free blacks might be soon absorbed in the slave clas, as happens inÂ¢ Cuba at the present moment. The difficulties contingent on such a measure might be considerable, but could hardly be insurmountable, and if they were once overcome a guarantee would be. obtained that the free labour would never degenerate into slavery. The point, however, tobe urged with the greatest force is this,-that, whether the embarrassments attending emancipation be great or small, they must at any rate be less in the end than those which accompany the maintenance of slavery. If the Abolitionists have not had things exactly their own way, yet neither have the Slaveowners.. They are living under the ban of Europe. The most powerful States in the world are enlisted in the accomplishment of a policy tha object of which is to destroy the traffic on which they depend. At any moment, by the discovery of some new system or expedient, the Slave Trade may become practically an impossibility, and. even where slaveholding is maintained without importation, as in America, the convulsions which such an institution generates shake the very foundations of the State. The substitution of some better system for one so precarious and so fraught with hazard as this is so obviously a dictate of common prudence that we cannot think it would be disregarded if once the opportunity were given; and it is on this account that we attach so much weight to the proposition which has been made. Hitherto, in our Slave Trade policy we have confined our efforts to the interruption of the supply, without attending to tie demand. Thesuggestionnow made provides a remedy for the defect, and airs at the abolition of slavery through the establishment of a better n arket for labour. The project has its difficulties,no doubt, but not greater than those which have met us at every point of the question, and which. v e have encountered with less promise of final triumph than is offered here.
Her Majesty has been pleased to signify to Lord' Panure, the Secretary of State for War, that it is Her gracious intention to personally distribute the Victoria Cross (the Order of Valour) on Friday, the, 26th inst. It is now determined that the ceremony of the distribution shall take place in Hyde Park, gnd not on the parade facing the Horse Guards as origin aly contemplated, so that a far greater number of the public may have the opportunity of witnessing the interesting proceedings. Prince Albert alnd aU the elder members of the Royal family, I rince Frederick William of Prussia, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, and a brilliant Court circle will be present on the occasion.

This individual bad not gone away two hours when about three yards square of the ground precisely over where he had been engaged gave way, and the water in the pond (which is at least 12 yards square, snd on an average something likesix feet deep with water) rushpd down the dip of the old workings, and falling suddenly like a. cataact a depth of 30 yards, came with imrmense velocity into other portions oi the works. In th2s part of the works there are two levels in the coal measure, and at tho time of the accident 11 men and boys were in the pit, three men. being in the lower level and the remainder in the upper. The water naturaUy fell to the lower level, where the three men, Tinsley, Brockleburst, and B3ddeley, wero engaged about It yards from the bottom of tlhe shsft, though not exactly in company. After a momentary intimation, by the great rnsh of wind, that something was wrong. Brocklohurst tfund himself surrounded by a large quantisy of waters and was driven by the strem into, an air road, where his leg became entangled for a ainate or two with tome et the dcbris. Ultimately he was forced into another short level, and finding the water incessing he made a desperat. effort to save his life, and ultimately got into the sump or water pit, where fortunately he was enabled to cling to the brck and woodwork, when by calUing out he was draw up, but not before he had sushined anumber of cuts an& bruise on various parts of the body.

The Leavenworth Herald of the 13th ult. learns that great excitement existed among the Mormons, and many outrages were committed by them. Brigham Young was driving all the Gentiles away. Judge Stiles, the United States' Marshal, and the Surveyor-General, with their families, together with a large number of emigrants, had already left, and others were hurrying away. In the New York market money was becoming rmore abundant, and was freely offered at 6 to 7 per cent. on fiu st-class securities on call. The banik statement was uniform. Stocks were influenced by the aspect of money affairs, and became more buoyant. In exchange foreign bills were very scarce, and the transactions extremely limited, while rates ruled firm with an upward tendency.

A telegraphic despatch from New Orleans of this day's date says:- " We have dates from Mexico to the 26th nlt. The election returns were generally favourable for Prewident Comonfort. There had been very heavy rains, and the in. habitants of the city of Mfexico were alarmed at the prospect of an inundation. " The fate of Colonel Crabbe and his party of Filibusters in Sonora was still in doubt." On the New York Corn-Exchange, on the 4tb of June, a dull tone prevailed, and prices of breadstuffs were rather lower and irregular. The decline in wheat was equal to Sc. per bushel, and corn had given waytoasimilar extent. The money-market was slightly easier.I Our usual cotton-reports from New York and New Orleanls have not come to hand by this telegraph.
THIE NEw ZEALAND GOLD-FIBLDS.-MenJr3 NicholsonandRidings, of Nelson,NewZealand, in their g('ld circular, dated the 14th of March, says:-" From the date of our last circular (26th ult.) to the 10th inst. the produce of the Aorere golddeld is stated to be, ata moderate estimate, 150 ounces, of which over 50 ounces have reached Nelson. The number of diggers at that date was ahout 150, one-third of whom had very recently arrived. The average yield per man, therefore, gives good wages, and we have sot heard of a goldfield where success is more evenly distributed. From a guUy on this side the great dividing range, and within a short distance of Motueka (a small settlement within 18 miles by water from tbe town) ld i ennyweights of gold have this week beea received. This sample is rounder than any other we have yet seen. It was in the neighbourhood of the place where this sample was found that, during last winter, the first indications of the existence of gold in the province were met with. From the Takaka Valley, which is also on the east side of the range, a few grains of gold have been brought into town, and a party has gone out to prospect that country more fully. We eave in these facts an evidence that the washings from both sides of the range, on the west at the Aorere, and on the cast at the Takaka and Motueka, contain gold; and this, taken in connex5on with the highly auriferous appearance of the inountain- leads to the reasonable presumption that the whole range will be found gold-producing. It may be taken as a very favourable indication that, the nearer to the high mountains the diggers proceed, the larger become the particles of gold. Some men have sold to our correspondent at the Aorere an ounce taken from a gully about two miles nearer-to the range, about whioh he wites that Iit is quite a different character of gold; it is a much larger grain, and darker in colour. " On the 20th of the same mouth they supplement the following:.-" The advices to-day from our goldfields we may briefly state to be that success had been luring the past week very general among the 300 men engaged in digging, though some had been altogetber unsuccessful, and that the yield for the week was over 200 onuces. Of this we have ourselves obtained more than one.half, but for the remainder were overbidden. Our own purchase to date amount to 200 ounces." MURDZE NExEA RADcLnnIF .-On Friday afternoon Air. nrice, one of the deputy-coroners for Lancashire, held an inquest at iadelifle on the body of an old woman which had been found in the river Irwell near that place. The deceased, who appeared about 60t years old, had been last seen at a lodgingisoube in Bury, where she called about 7 o'clock that morning. At this place she stated that she had left her lodgings at liamabottom early in the moyning for fladoliffe or Mianchester, having left to, people at her lodgings quarrelling and fighting with pokeers. Her dead boidy was discovered in the river the same afternoon. There vwere severe wounds about the head andface of the deceased the scaip being almost stripped from. the .skull in one place, Bnd the ase o the skull being frautured. A surgeon who had exaniined the body said death must have been caused by these inijuries, and not by drowning. The jury found a verdict of wilful marder agaiast tome porson or persons unknown.

TEE WEST INDIA AND PACIFIo MAILS. sOUTHAM1PTON, JUNE 14. The Royal Mail Company's steamship La Plata, Captain . G.

Our advices from Jamaica are to the 26th ult. During the previous fortnight the question of the wages of agricultural laboutrers had been warmly agitated. The FaTalmouth Post and the Watchiana argue that, as the labourers cheerfully submitted to a reduction of their wages when sugar was selling at from 101. to 121., they are entitled to an incresse now that the price has risen to 301. per hogshead. The Daily Adviertser considers such a mode of argument to be mischievous, as tending to sow the seeds of discord between employer and employed, and contends that, as the planter has been a loser for some years past, he is justified in taking advantage of thepresent rise in the price of produce. The 1orneinq Jotrnal prefers neutrality on the question, conceiving that the matter concerns only those who are directly interested. The William Hammond troopship, with a detachment of the 41st Regiment, having smallpox on board, had been admitted to pratique. The sick were landed at the Apostles' Ba1ery, and the remainder landed at Kingstou were marched up to Newcastle. Precautions had been taken to prevent the spread of contagion, and no case of smallpox having broken out in the island had been heard of up to the latest dates. The detachment of the 2d West India Regiment, which was sent to Belize, Honduras had been sent back in consequence of smallpox being prevalent at that place. The " May seasons" had fairly set in, and heavy rains had fallen for the last two or three days, completely flooding the streets. The public health continued good. De C(ordoma's Mercantile Inselligencer quotes coffee as worth 45s. per lOOIb. for ordinary. New corn was wanted. 1,200 barrels of flour sold at 39s. per barrel, and the market was firm at that price. Hams were very plentiful, and dull of sale; 8d. had been accepted for some recent lots. Sales cf mess pork had been made at 126s. to 128s. per barrel. No pimento at market. For soap there was no demend at all. Alewives were worth 24s. per barrel. Late receipts of cornmeal had sold at 22s. to 23s. Exchanges at Jamaica and colonial banks, ou London, were quoted-90 days, i per cent. pm. ; 60 days, 1 per cent. pm.; 30 days, 10 per cent. pmi.; private bills, at par. On New York, merchants' bills, 1J per cent. pm. Files of Demerara papers are to the 23d of May. The Combined Court had been constantly sitting since the departure of the last packet. Mr. Porter, at the last meeting of the Court after the mail had left, took the earliest opportunity to express the gratification he felt at seeing the satisfactory letter of Mr. Thomas H. Gladstone in The Times, in reference to the condition of immigrants in the British West India colonies. The propositi.)n of Messrs. Davies, Son, Campbell, and Co., of London, solicitors to the holders of the bonds of the Demerara Railway, to take over the line, to extend it, and put it in complete working order, and also to pay off the 45,0001. due to tbe colony, on condition that the colony guaranteed the payment of interest not exceeding 6 per cent. for the sum of 150,0001., underwent considerable discussion. Several resolutions were ultimately agreed to, in effect sanctioning the proposed arrangement, under certain conditions, which were set forth at length in the resolutions. The Court had voted the sum of $35,000 for payment of bounty on Portuguese imingrants from Madeira and the Western Islands, to be free of indentures on their arrival and at liberty to choose their own employers. The whole question of immigration had been brought forward, and resolutions adopted, setting forth the great want of continuous labour in the colony as the only drawback to its advancement and prosperity and the development of its resources, and making a strong appeal to Her Majesty's Government for the entire removal of all restrictions against the introduction byprivateenterprise of immigrants from all parts of China and the adjacent islands. The Court had resolved to vote the sum of $40,000 per annum for steam communication between Georgetown and Berbice and Georgetown and Essequibo, and for steam ferriage across the rivers Brrbice and Demerara, on the understanding that a spare steamer should be provided for sea service, and that none of the above services be ever performed except by steam vessels. Captain Sproston had offered to undertake the sea service, with the Tyne, at present under repair, for $26,0O0 per annum; and in the course of 15 months to put on a second reserve steamer of from 80 to 100-horse power, on condition of the colony lending him $12,000 on the arrival of the steamer, which would be given as security for the repayment of the money. The two steamers to be put on for $33,000. He also offered to take over the Demerary ferry on the expiration of the present contract and on the same terms. The sum of $45,000 had been voted for the cholera expenses, and $15,000 were placed on the estimate for the purpose of establishing dispensaries in the raral districts. Communications had been laid before the Court from Mr. G. Fielding, of Guernsey, and Mlr. W. S. iSndsay, of London, for direct steam communication, monthly, between Demerara and Great Britain, rid Barbadoes and Madeira, in reference to which the Royal Gazette observes: "We have no hesitation in saying that such a cotamunication would be profitable to the promoters, provided they put on sbips of sufficient power to perform the distance in ashorter time than the present mailstamere, and of capacity to bring a general cargo at moderate rates. If the steamers went hence direct to England they would always be sure of getting a large number of the passengers who now go home or conme out by sailing veseels for the sake of economy, and they would also get a considereble share of merchandise and small packages. The object of the promoters should be to carry passengers and mercbandise at moderate rates. If they do that they wilbe well supported." The Merchantman, from Calcutta, arrived at Demnerara on the 13th of May, after a voyage of 90 days, with 261 coolies. The mortality on board had been fearful, 113 having died during the passage, and of 60 who were conveyed to the hospital on their arrival five died while being landed, and several others subsequently expired in the hospital. "1 It appears from the investigation," says the Royal Gazette, " That the coolies selected were a set of sicldyF e3aaciated creatures, the refuse of the imnaigrants zollected for the Mauritius and, other places, and when put on board were more fit to have been sent to a hospital tha. on a long sea voyage. Many died of cholera during th- sare dxovin the- oooghly, ana many mnore of dYsentery and disrrboa before they reached the Cape. Ship. fb'er then broke out with fearful virulence, and th, whole shi becatme a sort of general hospital, in which the sick and the healtby were indiscriminately hudd?Ad na together. The arrangements of the ship, made under t4eiera of the, emigration authorities in Calcutta; were ino cy mad The platforms erected around the ship olstracted the ventiLation; the privies, too, were an intolesle nmisince, and the changes which have been made in t1, dietary tables, b1 the substitntion of better food tban the immigrants bave been accustomed to, has been fourd rrodauctive of injuiaos effects. These and several other can .es combined have led to the most sovere mortality that has ever occurred on board any immigrant ship coning to tl<'s colony. It is but dne to the captain and surgeon tj, say that they did all they couild to prevent the pro gress of the disease, aud to ameliorate the condition of they Ae unfortunato people." The weather at De ,rara bad been very wet during the last fortnight., and the rainy season was fully set in. The exp .,rts were snall. Trade was dull, tonnage abundaw .t, and freights scarce. At Grenada the 3 e islative session had prematurely terminated b I an adjoiurnment moved by the leading member f.f the Executive Council. The Charcoal Tax hba -Ang been found to work oppressively the inh a,bitants petitioned for its repeal. The House of 'Assembly went into committee on the petitions, ant' reported a recommendation that their prayer be gran,ted, and a Billwas brought in to give. it eJ[~ct. This report was adopted by 10 vres to '.. As anl expedient to prolong the tax, a 'proposuon to .adjour.n the Eiouse till the 8th of Scyte .nber was then made, and cai'ied by 10 to. $, and, the Lieutenant.Governor having acceded, the House stands adjourned accordingly. Three vacancies had been declared in the Houise of Assembly, for the supply of which writs had been issued, and, as soon as these elections are made, it was thought probable that the Lieutenant. Governor would caU the Legislature together by proclamation in order that public business may be resumed. The weather continued fair, and the sugar estates were still pushing hard with the crop. From Barbadoes there is very little of interest iu reference to legislative and general news. The House of Assembly had one meeting on the 12th nllt., when some of the clauses of the Bridgetown Waterworks Bill were agreed to in committee. During the fortnight the weather had been highly favourablefor sugar-making, and planters had made the most of it, not much of the crop remaining to be taken in. Except in the produce-market trade was dull. Sugar was worth from $71 to $8; molasses, 44c.; and rum, 60c. to 66c., and planters were expecting a further rise. The health of the island continued good. In reference to the goldfields recently discovered in Venezuela this mail gives us no additional intelligence. The Trinidad Sentinel of the 21st ult. says:- The steaLmer Orinoco arrived here last night from St. Thomas's. Her arrivallexcited a little stir among those who desire to visit the land of gold, as it was supposed she came from Angostura. It was not so, however ; she brought the news of the arrival of the English mail at St. Thomass. She left for Bolivar immediately after taking provisions, &c. We hear of a company being formed here for the land of gold, and whioh only awaits further information to depart." The townsfolk of Port of Spain were set atl agog by the news of the gold discovery. A vessel literally filled with pickaxes, crowbars, sledge hammers, spades, and other digging tools, ordered of the Trinidad merchants, was despatched for Bolivar two hours after the receiptof the intelligence. At Trinidad the weather continued most propitious for agricultural prospects. Many estates had taken off their crop, but others had canes sufficient to' continue sugar-making till the middle of June. Nearly all the sugar already manufactured or in course of manufacture being forestalled by purchasers, there would be little more for sale this season; for that little high prices were expected; $6 50c. to $6 75c. for sugar, and 35c. to 36c. for molasses, were the ruling price. No great quantity of rum had been exported this season, and the warehouses were getting filled; some sales had lately been made at 70tc per gallon (o. p.) The cocoa crop was over, and only small quantities occasionally offered for sale. The island was healthy, andeverything wore a cheerful appearance. 'lhe new Governor of St. Lucia, Mr. iHenry Hegart Breen, F.S.AL, assumed the adminatration of the Government on the 21st of May. A salute of 14 guns was fired from Mount Fortune during the ceremony of swearing him in; addresses were presented; the militia band serenaded the Governor; and a Drawing Room, numerously attended, was held. Mr. Breen has entered upon the duties of his office with the good wishes of the entire community. A smart shock of earthquake was felt at St. Lucia on the 22d about half-past 9 a.m. Eis Excellency Mlr. J. V. Drysdale left St. Lucia on the 20th of May in the steamer for Tobago to assume the duties of Governor of that colony. The St. Ttomaess Tidende of the 23d ult. contains the prospectus of the contemplated railroad between Caraccas and La Guayra, wbich project promises to be highly remunerative to the company.

On freight she bas diamonds from Rio and Bahia, value 87,9521., and specie from Teneriffe, value 2301. Advices from Buenos Ayres are to the 5th ult The steamer Prinoe was detained by the British Minister, in order to carry home the result of the election for 3overnor of the Province. The votes were as follow :-Alsina, 35; Pens, 18; Llavallol, 7. Alsina had declined his nomiia. tion, and tendered his renunciation to the General Assembly,on the ground of strong personal opposition to him by some of the assembly. His renunciation was negatived by 44 to 11, and his acceptance looked upon as certain. Dr. Alsina, Presdentof the Senate, was the candidate of the I Ultr-Liberal party, and the Opposition votes were divided between Don Juan Bautista Pena, and Senor LlAvallol, and their grand Indian invason was anticipatedL The bank of Buenos Ayreg had raised the interest on deposits J per cent. for gold, and 1 per cent, for paper per month; and charged 1per cent, and 14 percent. respectively for discounts. The ratesfor all RiverPlate produce were high Exchange, 74. The revolution in the Rosarlo had been put down by the movernorof Santa FE, and a temporary arrangement come to with Urqstiza. At Montvideo on the 6th ult, business reinained at a standstilL The fever which broke ont in the beginning of March had mnade great ravages The day the steamer left, no new cases having occurred, it was hopad to hava sub. sided. The total numberof deaths was estimated at between 1,400 and 1,600. Its origin was attributed to purely local causes, and vigorous sanitry measures were being taken to prevent itsrepurrence. In the country not a single case had occurred. Exchange was quoted at 73. From Rio we have letters to the 15th uit The new Chambers were opened on the 3d, but so far they had been occapied in arranging preliminaries. The Emperor congratulated himself onaccount of theextinotion of theslave trade A new Ministry had taken charge of the affairs of the country on the 4th ult., composed of the following gentlemen :-Senators Marquis de Olinds, Premier and Empire; Viscount de Mranguape, Foreign Affairs; Souza Franoo, Finances; Deputies Vasconcelloe, Justice; General Jeronymo Coello, War; and Saraiva, Navy. This was considered to be a Coalition Cabinet. It was doubted whether the new Ministry would be able to sustain itsclif. The yellow fever, which had appeared among the ahips in port at Rio, was daily diminishing aud may be reported as nearly extinct. An applic_tion had beeu made by the merchants to suspend the operation of the new tariff, so that it should not act upon shipments already made. The coilbe crop would be the largest ever known, and would probably reach 2,40,000 bags. In consequene of the Batk of Brazd havng raised the rate of discount to 9per cent. the moneyn aket was tight. The sales of ooffee since the sailing of the Avon had aksounted to 222,000 bags, Arrivals had been mederate on account of the continual rains, and the receipts for the month did not much exceed 200,000 bags. The movement of prices had been upwaads, and the rise since last report had been fully 200 reis in all qualities. Of sugar the sales since the 18th of April amounted to 389 cases, 900 packages Campos and 608 cases, 12,900 pacages Pernambuco and Bahia at 4$200 to 5S600 for white, 3ES92 to 3$800 for brown. Stock, 1,056 cases of the tormer, 794 cases, 30,000 packages of the latter. Some small parcels of hides from Rio Grando were sold at 380 reis to420reis peraroba. Thetotal amountof exchange negotiated upon londoa for this conveyanoe had been generally at 27id. 60 and 90 days, at which quotation remained firm; Paris, 342 to 346; Hamburgh, 652. Freights had declined, and, oWing to the high value of produce, rates must be considered nominal-35s. to 45s. for Europe; 60c. to 70c. for the United States. From Pernambuco we have the gratifying inteligence that the town was free from yellow' fever. In freights, owing to a scrcity of vessels, rates hdaddanced, and seven vesse had been taken at from 50. to 6Cs. for the Channel and Genox. Within a few days of the Teviot leaving, however, several vessels arrived, and rates were consequently likely to faLl.

TUBINER .ICTURES- AT MARLBOBOUGH. HOUSKE. Some 64 o 65 oil pictures by TFer have beem addedto the works of the painter.already exhiibited in Marlborough-house. They are dib*ntted througa rooms upstairs lately occupied by, the Brnal ai& Soulages collections. A few of tbe pictures bequeathed by Tarner to the nation. stii remain Un-, hung. Buts the grest balk of thit-magnificent in-, heritance is from this day expaoed. to public view.- Bearty acknowledgment is due, in. the first place,. to Sir Charles Eastlake and Mr. Worma far the, industry aud inteUigence they have ahovnin raaking7 these works so soon and, coneiderin .W the accomo-- dation at their command; so conLveniently acessible'. to the public. Next we must cougratulate MXrWornutn, upon whom this part of- the- worl- ash especially devolved, on the success with whieh h}has accomplished the difficult task of cleaning thesel. pictures and putting them in a fit state for appreciation. Only those who know the condition. i which7, the canvasses were left by Turner, andr the strange methods and materials employed by him>. especialy in his later works, canunderstand the difflsultieawith; which Mr. Wornum has had to struggle inthis part of his task. Lastly, we would direct publio attentiiD.to:the urgency which the exhibition of the-Tiurner be-. quest iwparts to the speedy settlement offthe qjuestion. how and where a national gallery is to befprovidecL in which these noble speoimens of art, together with. the collection given to the nation by ME Vernon,, may fittingly be bestovred. The addition now made to the exhibited'works of, Turner comprises pictures in all the successive stylesof the master. The examination of them has left us more than ever impressed with the conviction ofb the unparalleled. power and variety of the painter. Here wve may see Turner challenging in, suooession Wilson, Claude, and the two P.oussi,theVandeveldes, Backkuysen, Cuyp, and the ,otherDutch and Flemish marineandlandscapepainters,to say nothing of still more eccentric measurements of strength wLth Reynolds and Wilkie. We cannot attempt to do more than indicate the contents of this vast collection. .In respect of date of production it includes pictures from.1798, the year before Turner was elected Assooiate- of the Academy, to unfinished works of 1850, the year of his, death. In respect of subject here are Turner.' finestsea-pieces, asthe "Battleof Tlrafalgar,"with.thadeat+i of Nelson (480) supposed to beaeen from.the mizensbrouds of the Victory, where we look down on the'bloody deck, half amotheredc in the smoke of.theguns, through and over which loom the huge hull, and the forest of masts, and the chaos of sails,. im-- mbeasuirably the most awful painting of a. asa-fightthat has ever come from a painter's hand.; a. second sFLetch of the same battle (556); the " Spithead". (481), with men-of-war bearing up for anchorage ;- the " Van Tromp" (537, of 1832 (not 1844; as in. the catalogue); " The Meuse, with an orange mer-- chant going to pieces on the bar," of 181R(501); the three pictures of "The Whaler" (series 545,. 546, and 547), ghosts of grand conceptions of the date of 1845 andl 84, when the painter's handwss, unable to carry out Es daring conceptional.the " Snowstorm, and ateamboat off a harbour,mouth making signal," of 1842, which to most will-appea-. an attempt at representing what defies relpreseatation; and an unfinished but awful pictrea of a- " Fire at Sea" (558k with the rain of blazing. fragments falling throuigh a night of storm on tle raft,s on which the crew of the blazing vessel axe eadeavouring to esape. Then, of home lawnsape here are two. exquisite. pictures (1798)-" Buttermere Lake, wiith- part of. Crummock Water" (460), and " Morning.o Conis,. ton Fells" (461)-solid,free from eccentricity.or e.xaggeration, full of the sweetest magic of aerial -effect and truth of mere and mountain, the."'Grossingc the Brook" (497)k in which, so far as we. can judge, Turaer has out-painted Claude, thouglr.he has but the light of England and the course of a-Deonshire, river to set against the sun of Italy and the sublime - stretch of the Campa-na; "The Frosty.2or iing" (492), in which Tumer holds his own.-against the best' of eayp's winter pieces; the.- "WindsorCastle" (48,6), seen through summer haze,. a. worthy companion to the-exquisite "Abingdon,;". 'Aand.-- pit" (467) and "A Landscape with-cattle in. water"' (462), in which we see with what beauty andipower genius can invest the homeliest. subjeats; ".St. Mawe's, Falmouth Harboue' (4S4), with all the: bustle of the pilchard fishery; "'Yangston.Bank' (491), "Richiaen-hill on the Birthday. of the Prince Regent, 119" (502).

FORBIGN INTBLLIGENCE. Y,RANCE. JA portton of the followingappenxed in our Lond edition ew qm urlrv '._ fwRim OUR OWN OOE -NDENT.) PARIS, FRiDAY, JUNR 12, 6 P.M. The lists of Opposition candidates are stil in conflict with each other. Several of the names in both belong to men of eminence in their party, so that one does not well know whom to prefer-" Who shall decido when doctors disagree ?" I mentioned yesterday that one section of the DemocraMtic leaders nrotested against the list adopted at the same time Iy the Rspublican Sidcle and the Orleanist D6but&. Tie list put forth by the first-mentioned was incomF,ete yesterday; it is now, I understand, filled up in the following manner-Garnier Pagds' J. Reynaud, Jules Bastide, Jules Simon, and Eugene Pelletan. Thus the Silde candidates have to contend not only against the Government nominees, but also to encounter competitors in their own part. This division of interests will not be regretted by the Government. The election movement seems to extend itself. In the faubourgs placards described as of a "s editious tendency" are found on the walls in the morning, and so frequently that I am assured it has been thought necessary to orglanize a nightly service of police, in plain clothes, for the purpose of catching the posters of the offiensive proclamations. A circular from a well-known leader of the ultra-Democratic party, nrging the electors not to vote, has been for some days circulating at Lyons and other laces. So far as one can judge at present, it is believed that about 10 or 12 Opposition candidates will be elected to the new Chamber. The Costitutionel publishes the following list of Government candidates for the city of Paris ist Electoral Division, ML Guyard Dealain. 2d - AL Devinck. 3d - M. Germain Thihaut. 4th - M Vavin. 5th - MiL MonninJapy. 6th - IL Ferret. 7th - M. Lanquetin. 8th - M Foucher Lcpelletier. 9th - IL Reenigswarter. 10th - h. Veron. The MOniteur publishes several important decrees. One raises the following gentlemen to the dignity of Senator:-A1. Boulay (de la MIeurthe), President of Section in the Council of State; M. Favre, IYayor of Nantes, lately deputy; Baron Haussmann, Prefect of the Seine; the Marquis de Laroche Lambert; M. Le Roy, Prefect of the Seine-Inferieure; MI. Mallet, Vice-President of the Council-General of the Ponts-et-Chaussees; M. de Mesonan, lately deputy; Generals de Montreal and Niel; and M. Pietri, Prefect of Police. Another Imperial decree appoints Count de Germiny, Governor of the Credit Foncier, to be Governor of the Bank of France, in the room of Count d'Argout, whose resignation has been accepted, and who, by another decree, is named Honorary Governor of the Bank of France. A word or two about the new Senators maynot be out of place. M. Boulay (do la Meurthe) is a name known for its connexion with the Bonaparte family. The present bearer of it is chiefly remembered as the Vice-President of the Republic which terminated on the 2d of December, 1851. Re is a man of fair reputation, disliked personally by no one, and of moderate capacity. M. Favre, Mayor of Nantes, is hardly known as a politician; and the Marquis de Laroche Lambert is not much less obscure than his late colleague. Re is a Legitimist rallie, related to the Labedoyere family. M. Ernest Le Roy was in former times Sub-Prefect of Bayonne, and, under Louis Philippe, was an ardent Orleanist. His brother was the first in 1851 to proclaim the coming Empire. M. Ernest Le Roy is probably a zealous and useful functionary, but his chief recommendation in the eyes of the Minister of the Interior consists? no doubt, in the fact of his being a thorough-gomg prohibitionist. M. Mallet, Vice-President of the Council-General of the Ponts-et-Chauss6es, is spoken of by those who know him as a man of suPerior intelligence, of high scientific attainments, and of good private character. M. de Mesonan has the advantage of having been associated with Prince Louis Napoleon in the :Boulogne insurrection in 1840, and of having appeared at the bar of the Chamber of Peers with his chief for that event. He was defended by M. Delacour, while the Prince received the same assistance from H. Berryer. General Montreal is spoken of highly by his friends. He commanded for some time the army of occupation at Rome. General Niel is too well known to the army of the Baltic and the Crimea during the war -with Russia to require any particular notice. There are two Prefects, as I mentioned yesterday, in this new batch-the Prefect of the Seine and the Prefect of Police. The former ranks higher in the hierarchy of functionaries than his conftSre of the police, and the nomination of the latter to the rank of Senator is received with a little surprise. It appears, however, that his eligibility for his new rank will be increased by the functions of Director of Public Safety, the gentleman who now occupies that post, M. Collet Meygret, being about to retire. M. Pietri will thus be in reality, though not in name, Minister of Police. In alluding to General Niel I, should not omit to state that his loss to the Council of State is much regretted by several of his colleagues. Of his capacity as a scientific military man it is superfluous to say anything, but it may not be generallyknown that if many of the Council exhibited the same spirit of independence the body generally would not be held so lightly in public estimation as, in this respect, it is. General Niel is one of the few among them who has the courage to accept the responsibility of his opinions; and, whether the proposer of a measure be the Emperor or any one else, he states his opinion on its merits frankly and without regard to consequences. Count de Germiny, who has just been nominated to the high office of Governor of the Bank of France, is descended from an ancient family of Normandy. His father, after having filled several high State employments, was Peer of France under the Restoration and under Louis Philippe. As to the son, he commenced his political career as Prefect of the Seine-et-Marne, and was shortly after returned to the Chamber of Deputies by the electors of Melun. He afterwards, on marrying the daughter of M. Humann, Minister of Finance, left the Legislative Body, and entered on the atudy of financial matters. He was then appointed to the oflice of Receiver-General at Melun, and afterwards to a similar office in the Seine-Inf6rieure. In 1848 he was named Minister of Finance: he did not remain long in that position, and the Emperor, when the Cr6dit Foncier vas reconstituted, placed him at the head of that institution. The onranitenr publishes the official returns of the import and export trade of France during the last year, with the comparison of the two preceding. The total amount of the imports for 1856 in round numbers was 2,564 millions, being an increase of 468 millions over those of the year 1855, and of G9.2 millions over 1854. The items which show the oreatest increase over 1855 are corn, 181 millions - K'rench colonial sugar, 15; oleaginous seeds, 5 raw wool, 60 ; raw cotton, 25; rice, 17; raw and spun silk, 63; gold and silver, 74; sundries, 91 millions. Those which show the greatest falling off are foreign sugar, 8 millions; coffee, 2; coal, 4 ; olive oil, 5; rough castings, bar iron. and other metals, 4 ; and indigo, 3 millions. The exports in 1856 amounted to 2,375millions, being an u4creage of 338 millions over those of 1855, and of 634 over 1854. The items which show the greatest improvement as compared -with 1855 are wine and spirits, G0 millions; books, engravings, and music, 4; millinery, 2; paper, 2; prepared skis and gloves, 30; unbleached and dyed silk, 10; refined sugar, 10; woollen, silkc, and cotton wove goods, 119; gold and silver, 2 millions. Those articles which show the greatest decrease are, works in iron and other metals, 8; cattle, 2; and dye stuffs, 3 millions. The receipts of the Paris and OrleansPLailwayCompany for the week ending the 3d of June amount to 1,151,404f. 84c., being an increase of 260,067f. le. as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts from the 1st of January to the 3d of June amount to 24,583,084f. 79c., being an increase of 4,631,687f. 63c. as compared with the corresponding period of the year 1856.

VIENNA; z One of the Vienna papers has recived telegraphic intelligencefrom Pari5that the Marquis of Villamarina and Baron von Seebach have given official notice to the French Court of the approaching marriage of King Victor Emmanuel wi-th the Princess Sidonia, of Saxony. Though the news takes the Austrian public by surprise, the Austrian Court must have been aware of what was intended, and it probably endeavoured to prevent an alliance so little to its taste. The Dowager Queen and the reigning Queen of Saxony are sisters to her Imperial Highness the Archduchess Sophia, and it can hardly be doubted that the latter, about three weeks ago went to Dresden in order, if possible, to persuade the Saxon Court not to give the hand of the Princess Sidonia to the King of Sardinia. About four years ago there was a plan formed for marrying the Princess in question to a very high personage in this empire, but the latter withheld his consent, and since that time Saxony has always been found in the camp of the enemies of Austria. Baron Beust at Dresden, Baron Seebach at Paris, and M. Nostitz at Frankfort (in the Diet), have long made opposition to this Government, but the Saxon Court has never before openly displayed its unfriendly feeling towards the illustrious family with which it is sonearly connected, In a German paper which iS now open before me, a semi-official Austrian writer says that the journey of the King and Queen of Saxony to Sardinia was caused by " family affairs," and it is not unlikely that the expression quoted was an allusion to the projected marriage. The diplomatic moves and countermoves of Austria and Prussia are of extreme interest to a looker-on who is aware of the intentions and projects of both parties. For some time past Austria has been losing ground in Germany, and she doubtless expects to regain her former influence by means of an Austro German Customs union. Prussia is well aware of the intentions of her powerful rival, and she therefore throws every possible difficulty in the way of this Cabinet, which has made many and great sacrifices in order to realize its favourite project. If you have ever chanced to see an obtrasive man attempting to force his attentions on a prudish woman, you will be able to form a perfectly correct idea of the relations between the two great German Powers. Austria would fain be on an intimate footing with Prussia, but the latter objects to familiarities, and keeps her wooer at arms' length The Concordat has given Protestant Prussia a tremendous "lift," and every Austrian who crosses the frontiers into Germany speedily becomes aware that such is the case. By the last census it appeavr that Vienna has a population of 471,442 souls. There are 442,207 Catholics, 12,749 Protestants, 1,081 united and non-united Greeks, 15,376 Jevs, and 33 Turks. Although tho population is so considerable, there are but 9,458 houses in the city and suburbs. Some of the higher ernploy6s of the various police establishments in Germany are now assembled here, and endeavouring to make such arrangements that a simple pass-karte (ticket of identity) shall enable its (German) possessor to travel through all the States belonging to the GermaA Confederation. RUSSIA. (FROM OInR BMLIN CORRES0PNzDT.) BERLIN', J 'N . The small crumbs of information that one can pick up now that the high-placed and the well-informed have all left the capital are very swanty; the post seems the only source of intelligence left. From this sole fountain, then, I derive the following -I, from St. Petersburg, that there is an almost certainty that the Emperor Alexander will have a meeting with the Emperor Louis Napoleon either at Wildbad or Stuttgard in the early part of July; 2, from Potsdam, that it is more than probable that the King of Prussia will join his sister the Dowager-Empress of Russia, and ber son the reigning Emperor, at Wildbad, early in July, and bring them both home with him to Sans-Souci; and 3, from Paris, that, although as yet no fixed and unalterable travelling arrangements have been made by the Emperor for a visit to Germany within the next month, there remains little doubt of his having a meeting there, if in any way possible, with the Emperor of Russia. As these three statements coincide very closely with what I have announced to you several times of late, I presume they may be looked upon as pretty nearly correct, as far as the present time is concerned. The trade reports from St. Petersburg all describe business as very dull there at present, more particularly as the arrivals of grain from the interior were very few, and the foreign orders for corn still fewer. Tt is probably in consequence of this small demand for grain that at Samara, on the Wolga, there are now 300 vessels lying idle; it is to the effects of the war, however, that we must ascribe the following evidences of declining prosperity, which are contained in a statistical report lately sent in from the Government of Ekaterinoslaff. The number ot vessels on the Dnieper and Don amounts now only to 1,447, which is about the fourth part of what belonged to the shlpping Interest there before the war. At the 351 fairs held in Ekaterinoslaff during last year the sales amounted only to 3,500,000 silver roubles, w hich were 9,000,000 less than used to be the case before the war. The local authorities of St. Petersburg, on the other hand, are making arrangements for an increased traffic to their port, and have contrived increased landing accommodation; the landingplace of the Peterhoff Company is now removed to the English quay, and the latter, which was hitherto the place where the Croustadt steamers plied from, is to be reckoned among the landing-places for foreign steamers. These alterations are, perhaps, the result of the changes and reforms already introduced into the regulations for passenger traffic which I lately described, and, it may be hoped, betoken other changes soon to be made in the tariff. When Prince Bariatinski entered on his post of Stadtholder of the Caucasus in the early part of this year he sent off a mission to the Persian Court to announce his nominationto that post. This mission, wbich was headed by General Prince Melikoff ar- rived at Teheran on March 28, and had an audience of the Shah on April 14th. The audience is reported to have been lengthy and very satisfactory, as far as showing the great interest taken by the Shah in the character and intentions of his neighboura. The entrance of the Mision into the town of Teheran is described as having been verv bril- liant, the Secretaries of the French and Turkish Missions there and the various foreign officers in the Persian service having ridden a Persian mile out to mecet the Russian Mission, Althoughk the passagea of arms we have lately had -ith Persia have come to a somewhat abrups conclusion, it WvI not be without interest for the future to know that the mutual relations of thatempire with Russiai, paticularly on the Caucasus3 side, are just now very friendly, and that there appars every probability that Prince Bariatinski, by ins tact and good management, will succeed in re mhoving many incipient causes of dissatisfaction 'which appeared to be bpringing up between the twa neighbouring States in General Mouravieff's time. The Emperor baa lately deputead a superior officer of the MOsCOW University, named Severkoff, accompanied by a person skilled in making anatomical preparations, to proceed to the Sir-Daya river and make experiment and researches, for the most part on the influence of the so-called " continental climate" on animals. 'This is the first mention that has been made of these regions in the press for the last two years, although just previously they were subjects of great interest. The last definite information that had reached us hete in the west was, that the Russians, after proceeling up the river to Ak-Metechid, now ca]lkd Perowski, had stationed a chain of posts all along the river, so as perfectly to command its passage, and to get the variouscaravans posing to the nortb, and, consequently, the commerce of the people in the south, entirely into their power. All that has since transpired of the movements of the Russians in those parts amounts only to a vague report of their having taken possession of Taschkend in the course of one of those feuds which seem to constitute a chronic disease in Ebiva and Eokhan, aud which often give rise to predatory ineuraions on the part of the Khirgeses up to and even over the Chinese frontier. Of no other of Russia's advanced posts in the east is so little known as of this settlement on the Sir-Daya. For instance, from the military post on the other side of the Balkhasch we hear not unfrequently that a respectable military force is assembled there, having under its protection a sufficiently numerous population to admit of the numerous advantages of the soil and locality being turned to acoount, so that a comparatively charming oasis has been created there beyond the region of the steppe. The lake there, and the river Ill, which flows into it, are navigated by steamers, a well-supported series of military postaprotects the frontier, the superior officers receive every now and then encomiums from the home Government for their akilful administration, and the juniors for their bravery in the numerous affairs they have with the frontier tribes, &c. In fact, the whole tract of country round and about Lake Ara1, and between that lake and the Caspian Sea, furnishes just now but very little matter for the public press. It would almost appear as if the reports that were lately so rife of the Russians having founded a number of settlements on the east and south-east bank of the Caspian were unfounded, or that the Russians have kept the matter so secret that nobody can hear anything of them. It is averred by Russians themselves that from the very beginning such establishments appeared very improbable inasmuch as they would tend to disturb the good relations existing with Persia; and, moreover, that the maintenance of establishments in those inhospitable recions is a matter of such great difficulty that even New PetrowBk itself would have been long ago given up, if it had not been indispensably necessary to have some means to keep the Turcomans in check, and thus provide for the safety of the caravan traffic. Among the numerous valuable results that have proceeded from the recent researches of M. Bahr in the region between the Caspian and Black Seas may be reckoned the settlement of a question that had long interested men of science, as to whether there had not formerly existed a water communica. tion between those two seas-viz., in the valley of the Manitsch, which stretches nearly due east and west; and, in any case, whether one could not be formed now. he traffic between the two seas goes at present into the two rivers Don and Wolga, which approach each other very closely above a place called Zaritzyn, and are there stated to be connected by a railroad. (I think the last we heard of this place was a few months back, that a railroad was projected there, but I have not heard til now that the railroad already exists.) One circumstance that seemed to favour the plan of a water communication was, that in addition to the Manitsch, which rises in the neighbourhood of the Salt Marshes and flows into the Don, near where it empties itself into the Black Sea, there is also another river, risng not very far from the source of the former and falling into the Caspian. M. Bahr has, however, ascertained that no water connexion at _present exists, and that the valley of the Upper Manitsch lies so far above the level of the two seas that the cutting of a canal between them by means of the two rivers would be, if not impossible, at any rate Eo expensive that it could never pay. It turns out now, that Admiral Count Putiatia, whose departure for Kiachta was mentioned some little time back, has really gone on a mission to the Chinese Court at Pekin, and must by this time have already arrived there. The frigate Olivezz3, which left Nicholaieff last autumn, and is now daily expected in St. Petersburg, has already forwarded home letters, which she took in at Hongkong about the beginning of February; in the previous November she had performed her mission, which consisted in exchanging the ratifications of the Russian treaty with Japan, which took place at Simoda. On this occasion the Olivezza. stayel some weeks at Simoda, during which time the guns of the Diana, which had been wrecked there and which were kept there for the Russians, were made a present to the Japanese. During part of January the frigatewas stationed near Hongkong, anld some of her officers happened to be on shore at the time of the grand arsenic conspiracy there, and were among the sufferers from it. The report the captain of the vessel has sent in about the state of things in Canton is said to be couched in very reserved terms, but gives the reader to understaul that the Chinese on this occasion will be able to offer a more steadfast defence that on former occasions. ITALY. (FRO3s ouR. OWN ConR sPoxDruM.) TURIN, Jusu 9. This day the Pope is expected to arrive at Bologna, and it is to be hoped that he has better weather for the occasion than we have in Tarin today, for it is raining here now hard enough to destroy all the pleasure of travelling, and completely to ruin the effect of any concerted pageant. The thermometer, too,s which markedcabout 80 deg. of Fahrenheit yesterday morning in the shade, is 20 de?. lower this morning. The preparations for the official decoration of the city of Bologna will cost, it is said, about 150,O00 scudi, and this outlay, as I mentioned on a former occasion, has been made solely on the responsibility of the Mayor or Senatore of the town, and it appears that the Senatore assumed the responsibility of expending largely the municipal funds without consulting the Council at the express desire of Cardinal Antonelli, who, hearing that the Municipal Councils of the Romagna intended taking steps for addressing the Pope during his sojourn among them, gave particular instructions that they snould on no account be assembled at this time of year. His Eminence might possibly have thought it better that the proprietors of the Romagna should not be disturbed ini their agricultural pursuits at this season, and that they would be better employed among their silkworms than appearing prematurely in the chrysalis state of holyday attire; but more probably he hoped, by thus preventing the assembling of those bodies which are supposed to represent the inhabitants of the various com-unes, he should be able to nip in the bud the preparations for a legal remonstrance to the Pontiff in person. There is no doubt that several members of the Municipa3 Council of Bologna had intended taking advantage of this visit to present to his Holiness such a remonstrance against the misgovernment of ths country as they last year forwarded to Rome on the same subject, and it is more than probable that the example of the capital of the Legations would have been foUowed by many other towns. As it is, finding their Municipal Council was prevented from formally meeting and pagsing resolutions, as intended, and that the Senatore wiU be the only civic officer who wil be allowed the privilege of approaching the Sovereign on any matters of more serious business than to kiss his toe, the Bolognese, including the wealthiest inhabitants of the town, the largest proprietors of the province,and the principal merchants and bankers,bave signed an address to His Holiness, which is to be consigned to the Senatore for pre3entation. This address, as far as I have been able to learn, is of course couched in the most respectful lnguage towards His Holiness himself, but, 'while guardedly moderate in tone and demands, ib boldly exposes the sores for which it solicits immpediate remedy. It sets forth the evils of mal. administration, peculation, and corruption in the Government, and the non-execution of the laws,and, Without going so far as to suggest, as the President of the FrenchRepubliodid,"wecularization and the Code Napoleon," it humbly begs the Sovereign Pontiff to causea triob inquiry and the necesay reforrcs in aU departments of Government, aind that he will be pleased to enforce the execution of those laws which now exist in his dominions (laws which, moreover have elicited the admiration of the Count de Rayneval), and it points to the absolute necessity for organizing anative army and dispensing withforeign intervention. In fact, it has been drawn up with so much moderation, and is so reasonable in its demands, that it has been signed by men who are notorious for their attachment to the Papacy as a temporal Power, and it is to be hoped, for his own sake, as well as for that of his order, that His Holiness may be able to profit by this appeal to his iustice. A visit from the Popes to the second city of their dominions is an occurrence so rare that it allows the widest field for sueculation as to its purpose and its consequences. Oin the 16th of this month Pius TX. will have concluded the Ilth year of bis reign, bat this is the first time of his visiting Bologna since assuming the tiara, and people are as much lost in wonder as to the effects of his visit as they are on the approach of the comet. Pius IX. is reputed a weak-minded amiable man; as Sovereign, fond of popularity, and full of benevolence; aud, as head of the Churcb, a jealous guardian of pontifical ascendancy. At Bologna, as at Rome, he will find himself immediately surrounded by the agents of his Prime Minister, while the principal local authorities with whom he will come in contact will be Monsignor Amic, the proLegate (a nominee of Cardinal Antonelli's); Cardinal Viale Prela, the Archbishop of the diocess, and celebrated for having matured the Austrian Concordat; Count Degenfeld, the Austrian Commandant; and probably also Count Gyulai, who is said to have gone down to the Roman States on an inapection tour. In the society and under the influence of such persons why should it be expected that the Pope will act more liberally or more sensibly than while enjoying the counsel of Cardinal Antonelli, M. de Rayneval, and General Goyon? An amnesty he will probably grant of some Idnd or other, and several persons will be set at liberty who possibly never ought to have been in confinement. That is a measure of temporal rule for which he has the precedent of the most cautious despots, but what hope can be felt that the frank and honest remonstrances of the Romagnoli will be allowed to take effect upon his natural goodness of heart, or that his religious scraples will not now, as hitherto, mar his better judgment in dealing with his subjects ? A terrible catastrophe occurred at Leghorn on the 7th. Upwards of 3,000 persons were assembled in. the Theatre degli Aquidotti to witness the representation of the taldng of Sebastopol, when suddenly one of the rockets let off to imitate the bombardment set fire to the side-scenes. A sudden panic seized the public, the people in the pit rushed to the doors, and many of those who were in the boxes and galleries attempted to save themselves by jumping into the pit. The Carbineers vainly attempted to stem the current by assuring the people that there was sufficient time for all to go out quietly; and many, being frightened out of their senses, threw themselves out of the windows, although the British Consul, Mr. Macbean, had caused ladders to be placed at some of them. This disaster is the more to be regretted as there was really no occasion for such a panic, the fire being got under almost immediately afterwards, before it had time to spread. The MIonitore Toscano states that 43 persons were killed and 134 wounded. On hearing what had occurred, the Grand Duke immediately set out for Leghorn, and visited those who had been carried to the hospitals. The news of the silk crop has been tolerably favourable the last few days, but at present it is impossible to anticipate what may be the effect of this sudden change of temperature, or whether it is general or only partial. SWITZERLXAND. We learn by telegraph from Berne, under date of the 11th inst., that the National Council of Switzerland, after examining the report of the Committee, had unanimously decreed the ratification of the treaty for the settlement of the Neuch.tel question. The official text of the treaty is as follows "Art. 1. Elis Majesty the King of Prusi consents to renounce for ever, for himself, his heirs, and successors, the sovereign rights which Art. 23 of the treaty concluded at Vienna on the Oth June, 1815, attributes to him over the principality of NeuchfUtel and the county of Valangin. " Art. 2. The State of Neuchfbtel, dependent henceforth upon itself, will continue to form part of the Swiss Confede. ration, in the same manner as the other cantons, and conformably to Art. 75 of the above-cited treaty. " Art. 3. The Swiss Confaderation wil defray aU the ex. penses resulting from the events of September, 1856. The canton of Neacbfltel cannot be called upon to contribute towards the payment except as in the same measure as any other canton and at the pro rata of its money contingent. II"Art. 4. The expenses which are at the charge of the canton of NeuchAtel are to be shared by alJ the inhabitants according to the principle of just proportion, without being, by an exceptional tax or by any other manner, exclusively or chiefly made to faU upon a class or category of families or of individuals. " Art. 5. An entire and full amnesty will be granted for all political or military offences or misdeeds connected with late events, and in favour of aU the NeuchAtelese, Swiss or strangers, and especially in favour of the militiamen, who by crossing into a foreign land escaped the obligation of taking arms. No action, criminal or correctional, or for damages, can be instituted either by the Canton ofNenchfltel or by any corporation or person vwhatsoever against those who took part either direct ly or indirectly In the events of September. The amnesty will extend equaly to al political offences or offences of the press anterior to the events of September. "Art. 6. The revenues of the Church property, which in 1848 were annexed to the State, cannot be employed otherwise than as originally intended. "Art. 7. The capital and the revenues of charitable insttutions, of institutions of public utility, as also the fortune left by the wil of Baron de Pury to the bourgoii of Neuchitel, shaU be religiously respected; they shall be kept up according to the intentions of the founders and to the acts which instituted those foundations, and can never be employed for any other but the original object for which they were intended. " Art. 8. The present treaty shall be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged, within a term of 21 days, or sooner if possible. The exchange of ratifications to take place at Paris.

C. xL DE HATZFELDT. "K lISSELEFF." SPAIN. (FRtOM OUR OWN CORRuESPONcMT.) hMADRID, Ju1N 8. Some of the 3adrid papers mention a report that an agent of the Englisl coupon-holders has arrived in Madrid. I have been unable to discover the slightest foundation for this rumour. The question of the coupons attracts more and more attention, on account of an idea which has got abroad that this Government contemplates its settlement. Of this the Opposition makes a weapon, which, if well wielded, would be formidable, for the question is most unpopular bere. It is unpopular for several reasons. First, because the Spaniards have been told that the certificates are aU in the hands of a few wealthy speculators, who have bought them for a song from the original holders, for which reason, it is argued, with true Spanish logic, the debtors are no longer bound to pay. Secondly, there is a strong and prevalent belief that the Ministers who settled the coupon question would make of the operation a very profitable transactionforthemselves. Thirdly, Spaniards have an intense didlike to parting with their money to foreigners, however fairly they may have earned or be entitled to it. Other reasons might be stated, but these are the principal ones. O0 the other hand, all reasonable persops must see mad I think the opinion begins to gain some little ground herethat one of the great causes of the depression of Spain's credit has been, and is, her dis- honesty towards her foreign creditom Perhap s one of the most foolish acs ever ommitted by a Minister Wu the ep udiaioi of a porton of thfe overduo coupons. . Ido not think it is generally understood, either in this country or abroad, wht an effect it has had in retarding the growth of Spain,, credit. MIaking every allowanoe for the habituUlly mnsettled state of politics here, and for the general badness and instability of Spanish Governments, I would still ask whether the enormous difference in price between Spanish stock and certain continental stocks iB justified by other circumstances or explicable by other facts than that Spamn ha5 shown herself dishonest, and incurred the atigniof repudiation? If we consider the internal wealth of this country, as yet so little developed, the enormou5 increase in her revenue within the last 20 years, the mineral riches she contains, and of which fresh proofs are every day obtained, the increase of her population, which will be shown by the present census, the manmer in which railroads are being almost forced upon her, in great part by foreign capital and enterprise, we cannot but feel disposed to admit that Spain, if she ean avoid civil and foreign wars, must end by extricating herself fronm her difficulties. That sbe is at the end of her revolutions I do not believe; indeed, the probabilities are that within two or three years she will have a more serious one than any that has lately been witnessed here; but,-strange as it may appear, such political convulsions do not retard the material progress of this country so much as might be expected, or as they would do in others. Takiag all things into consideration, and weighingthem impartially, it does not seem to me that, if Spain retrieved her diahonest acts towards her foreign creditors, a differ ence of 30 per cent. inthe market prices of French and Spanish Threea could be justified or maintained. I believe that if Senor Bravo Murillo were to confess his secret thoughts, he would admit that he made a blunder when he declared Spain insolvent and defrauded her creditors. None better than himself could repair his error, and if he came into office I should by nio means despair of Eeeing some atonement made. At the same time, if the present Government undertook a measure of the sort, it is thought, in faet not doubted. that he and his partisans, powerful in the Lower Chamber, would strenously oppose it. The Progresitas would do the same with might and main; so would also the greater part of the press-the whole of it probably, except the organs of the Government. Indeed, it would be a famous cheval de bataile for the whole of the Opposition. The Spanih public has anything but a high opinion of the honesty of these Ministers; the project would be looked upon as a scheme for enriching themselves, the outcry against it would inevitably be loud, and the upshot might be the fall of the Cabinet. This is why I caunot believe that the matter will be brought forward in any satisfactory form during the session of the Cortes. To settle it by decree during the recess would be a course not unattended by danger, but still less immediately perilous. The affair would have to be submitted to the Cortes in their next session, but stiUl, between this and then, many changes may occur; and, if the Government could weather the storm, they would certainlv find Spanish credit improve, and their hands would thereby be strengthened. It is easier to reconcile people to a fait accompli than to the adoption of an unpalatable proposition. Captain Wright leaves Mladrid to-day with despatches from Lord HIowden for the Foreign-office. A misprint in my letter of the 28th of May, which appeared in The Tinws of the 2d inst., needs correction. The number of negroes estimated to have been imported into Cuba during the period of Concha's command is not 100,000, but 10,000. The Three per Cents. were done at 40.25; Ditto Deferred, 26.15. PORTUGAL. The King of Portugal has communicated to the Lisbon Cortes, through the President of the Council, his intention shortly to contract a matrimonial alliance, but no intimation has been given as to the name of the bride elect, the Marquis merely observing that she would be a Queen worthy of the Portuguese nation. The question of the future Queen's dowry was referred tothe Finance Committee, and both }ouses named deputations to wait upon His Majesty to offer the congratulations of the Legislature. It is believed that Maria Sophia, the second daughter of Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, is to be His Majesty's bride. She is about 16 years of age.
THE EVANGErLIjCAj,ALLjACE. OnFriday afternoon a large attendance of clergy and laity, members of the Evangelical Alliance, took place by the kind permission of his Grawe the Archbishop of Canterbury in the guard-room of the ArchiepiscopalPalace at LAmbeth, to receive from the deputation, consistDng of the Rev. J. Carr Glyn, theRev. Dr. Steane, and theRev. iermann Schmettan, recently sent to Berlin, a roport of their proceedings in preparatioa for the Christian assembly in that city next September. Among those present on the occasion, besides his Grace the Archbishop, wero Lord Calthorpe, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Manchester, the Bishop of Ripon, the Bishop of St. David's, the Bishop of RuperVs Land, Bishop Carr, late of Bombay, his Excellency the Prassian Minister, Count Bernetorif, Sir Culling Eardley, the Rev.C. T. A. Steinhopf, minister of the German Lutheran Congregation, Savoy, Strand; Professor Martin, of Aberdeen- the Dean of Canter6ry, the Rev. Wiliam Tiven, the htev. Henry Vemn, the Rev. J. S. Jenkinson, the Rev. J. Jordon, Dr. Cr;wford, Mr. F. Crossley, M.P., Mr. .T. I. Briscoe, hLP., Mr. C. Cowan, M.P., the HIon. W. Ashley, General M'Innes, Major-General Rowland Eustace, Major-General Alexander, Sir H. Verney, the Rev. AW. M, Bunting, Mr. Eruest Bunsen, the Rev. G. Mfans. A portion of the Scriptures having been read and prayer offered up by the Bishop of Ripon, The Archbishop of CANTERnURY said that no introductory observations were necessary on the present occasion; nor was it needful to enter into any explanation as to the cause which had led them, as Christians, to meet together on a subject of common interest connected with their common faith. At a meeting of that kind those who had come from an embassy were the persons to give an explanation. When Paul and Barnabas, who had been visiting many places in Asia, came back the Apostles were called together to hear all the things which had been done for them. It was for a similar purpose that they were then met together. They were met to hear what their brethren who had been sent forth into foreign lands had to communicate as to the state of religion in those countries with which they themselves were not so weU acqnainted. They therefore had nothing more to do than to listen to the explanations which the deputation had to offer. The Rev. J. JoRDoi; having read a list of the names of the noblemen and gentlemen who had written letters of apology for not being able to attend, but who expressed their sympathy in the object of the meeting Sir CULLING EARDLEY entered into a brief history of the rise and progress of the society caUed the Evangelcal AUiance. T ere had been three assemblies similar to that now contemplated to be held at Berlin-one in 1846, another in 1851, and a third in 1855. Each of those meetings had its peculiar characteristic. The meeting of 1846 exhibited the principles of the Aliance to Cbristendom. They felt it to be very tentative and probably very imperfect. At the meetings of 1851 and 1855, which were providentiaUy brought about by the Industrial Exhibitions in England and in France, great progress was made, especially in regard to facts and statistics as to the reigious condition of the different nations of Europe, aU of which had been embodied in two volumes published by the society. After stating the subsequent proceedings of the society up to the appointmeat of the deputation to Berlin, the hon. baronet concluded by expressing a hope that the account which those gentlemea had to give of their mission would afford satisfaction to the meeting. The Rev. J.. CARR GL), N then proceeded to state the course taken by himself and the two rev. gentlemen who were associated with him in order to Carry out the objects which the Alliance had in view in sending them as a deputation to Berlin. When the deputation arrived at Berlia they found the committee which had been already formed there most zealons and anxious to do what they could to forward the great work in hand. On considering what should be the programme of the maeetimg in September, they found that there were some difficulties which they would have to surmount; but, on the whole, he believed there would be some very interesting ton!Cs brought out, without involving any interference with po7htical matters or other questions of a doctrinal kind. Tho subject of religious liberty would, he believed, be cntered upon, but at the same time it would re=uire to be treated with great forbearance and Christian feeling, and with all deference to the King of Prussia and his Government. The rev. gentleman then gave an accomnt of the interview of the deputation with the King of Prussia, which was afterwards more fully detailed by the Rev. Dr. Steane. His Majesty appeared to be deeply impressed with the feeling that the meeting of the Alliance at Berlin would be most rseful to his kingdom, and that it would assist him in his efforts to put down any views of church government which were not of a universal Christian spirit, and, at the same time, aid himn in promoting evangelical teachsag in the schools of hiskiÂ°ngd o. His Majesty ofered the use of the Garrison Church which was in the centre of Berlin, for the confereice, and there was reason to believe that the King would himself be present on one day during the proceedings.

Dr. SrTEAUN said that the work confided to the deputation was threefold. They had first to present an address to the King of Prussia, thanking him for the deep interest he had showa in reference to the conference to be bald in September; next they had to confer with the commiuttee in Berlin; and, latly, they had to vit various parts of Germany and put themselvestin a romlvatZiQ wilsU 4ifferqpl perqDu in referenoe to the smane subject, and then to retmrnn~ way of Paris and confer with the committee there w1itfi reference to their interview with thie YinofPsia lt would not he proper In a me*eting a''e tpheupree.

The busainess Of the conference woul nefatwflsd0zi t,ve the discssion of great and important subje s which were to be prepared and elaboratedi by persons particularly nomi. mated for that purpose, and, secondly, the recption of reports as to the existing state of evangelical religo in th various countries of Christendom. After enumerating the different subjeots that would be discussed the rev.seir said that as the business would be princpall cooucer in t'he German languagle there would beag'enUerazl'rw'num,'ein the English and French language of what was so done, and there was a distinct understanding that if the conference came to any resolution, or adopted any practical measure no such resolution ormeasur should he adopted until it hai been Presented to andconsidered by the mnembers of the c,nference in their several languages. With regard to the subject Of religiOus liberty, the general foeelng was that the principle should be discussed, bat that any practical applica. tion of that principle should be reserved for a comminttee. Such a committee would be earlY aPpointed, and they would finially report their recommendations on the subject. By this course they would, onL the one side, avoid the difficulties, to -which they were exposed, and, on the other, still advocate the great principle of religioust freedom. Another object was to appoint some of their brethren to go quietly, without any ostentation or iilolt, through the Catholio countries, and there spek to the people themselves on this great Christianprinciple. The third dutyof the deputation wsto travel through different parts of Germany. This they did:-They went throughPztussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Wurtemberg. Baden, Rhenish Pxneaia andL thenL came home by way of Paris. Andl what was the result of their observations? lLet not theAllianco deceive themselvesunder the notion that the views they entertained or the subjects at which they aimedl were, in any sense of the word, popoulr in Germany. There were some who, withA adept Of Christian conviction, with a clearness of christia aprehen. sion, and with an enthusiasm like that which the Kig en: tertained and exhibited, enteredl into the cause as His Majesty himself did; but they were very few. One Lumtheran clergYman informed him that so extensive was the hostile spirt, even among the Congregation of his own church, that he had been compelled to drive the Reformers from the table because the Lutherans would niot allow them to partake of the Sacrament unlews they would consent to give up their own principles and ally themselves to the Lutbera church. That hio3tilefeeling rvie hogotGray but mnost of al in pav revia.hruhu Gray The Rev. H RRMsyi ScnM-ArxU said that Germany was just driving into the fold the scattered sheep that remained after the lengthened period of infidelity that had Prevailed. They were befling to revive religion in Ger. many, and they were afraid of anything that caLme firom abroad, lest it might interfere with the great work, in which, they were themseveeng ed The way toget at theGer- man 3nind was to establish a theological newspaper. There was nothing a German liked Eo much as having A suib. ject treated thoroughlyhe would say, dogimatically, thsologically, philosophically. Great sympathy was felt ini their movement in the south of Germany, WurtemberT was a country which had been kept free from alt infidelity and rationalism. From the Palatinate of Spires, in Bsvailsa, they might expect many clergymen to attend the conference. They woul la Y before the conference a nlan for building a newr evangeli-cal church on the'- ruins of thlat palace -whero the first Princes of Germany enLtered their Protest to Charles V. Spires was called the baptismal font of Protestantism, and the clergy were anxious that al P'rotestants should have a stone or brick, in that bauidinag. At EHeidelburg they found C0hevalier Bunsen, whose heart yearned after the full development of rligious liberty. But the day had riot yet arrived for the freee dizcussion of thes matters in that country. Hle earnestly hopedl that t'he time would come when religious freedom mighit be as oPenlY discussed in his own native Germany as it was in this more fortunate laud of liberty. The Rev. Dr. STEm'rcoFy begged to be allowed to make oneoOrtwo observations. His Gracelknew that he had been C5 Years minister of the Lut-heran congregation in London, and,bhaving enjoyed the geat prvilege at one time of being Foreign Secretary to the B1rtish and Foreign Bible Society, he had occasion to travel in his own dear native land, and he biad therefore become acquainted extensively with the state of that country. The observation which his friend had maade respecting the unhappy state of feeling existin between the Luthemus and the Reformers mighbt led to t'he idea that the feeling more generally prevailed than it actually did, Heliad the happiness of being onL the mnOst intimate terms of Christian love and harmony with members of both the Lutheran anid the Reformed Church, and he had often been admitted to preac'h in the chuirches of the Reformers. InL ,isy instances the most entire union and harmony existed t'etee the Luth eran and the Reformed Church. it was true that infidelity had made awful progress in his native land, but still it was as trmethatGod had alwava maintained not merely in Wurtemberg, hut likewise in other parts of Germany, a host of Christians, andl it was his earnest desire that the efforts now being made might be conducive to good for his dear native land. But he was aware of the many difficulties with which the society would have to contend, therefore he would the more earnestly impress upon his friends the necessity of conducting their various important matters in a spirit of heavenly wisdom, prudence, and discretiOnl, which must certainly greatly contribute to the attainment of their benevolent and mnost Christianik-e object. The Archbishop Of CAxvNTERBUY askedl whether any gentleman- present wished to put any quest-iLon to the deputation ? Sir C. E.ARDLEY raid the Dean of Canterbury had taken a great interest in the object of the deputation, and perhaps he would address some observations, to the meeting,. The Dean of CAX-TERBtTRY replied that the explanations wvhich had been already given were so satisfactory that he had no question to ask. Sir C. EARDLEY then made a few observations in reference to what he conceived would be the final result of this great movement, provided it continued to be as well suppotda twas at present. PIn answer2 to a question, The IRev. Dr. STVEASE said that -matters of doctrine would not be 3made the subject of discussion at the conference, nor would any formal resolutions be adopted. The Riv, W. M. BrTv (Wesleyan minister) then offered up a prayer, after which the Axcbishop of Canter. bury pronounced the benediction, and the meeting separated.

APPEALS. TTOTTSE OF LORDS. Ju. 13. Their Lordasbips sat this afternoon at half.past 1 o'71ock for the purpose of delivering judgrsent ia the fol. loving cases. NIGHITWICK V. LORD. This was an appeal from the decision of the Lords Jus. tices, varying an order of Vice-Chanceilor Kinders ey uade in a suit instituted by the respondent against the appelant. The question in this case was Whether the ap. pelJant as executor under his father's will, was justified in working a leaseholdcoLiery inasteadof sellingit, together with the other personal groperty, and accounting for its proceeds to the respondent, is sister, as the residuary legatee. The Court below held that he was not justifaed in wvorking the colliery, although it had turned out much more beneficial to the estate than if he had sold it. The preseut appeal was then brought, and was argued before the House on the 2d of March last, when the further consideration was post. poned. The Attorney-General and Mr. Welford appeared for the atppelepnt, dnt Mr. Rolt and Mr. Barber were counsel for The -LoaD CI5ANCELLORZ in delivering the judgment of the House, said that, in hn5iopisuon. the decision of the Court below must be affirmed, and the appeal disnilsed Lord WME2;SLEYDALE having concurred, The apeeal was dismissed with costs accordingly. aBE PRESIDEiT ANiD SCIHOLARS O1 ssAODALEN COLLEGE, OXFORD, V. THE ATTORhEEY.GE(;E lL. This was an appeal from a decision of the balster of the Rolls pronounced in a suit instituted by the Attorney. General at the instance of the poor of the parishes of St. Olave, in Southwark, and St. John, itorasydown, against the appeolants, for the purpose of having it aeclared that a certain deed. purportlng to convey certain land to the appellants might be declared void, and that the said land might be reconvoyed to the churchwardens and overacers of the poor of the said parishes. It appeared that by an Act of Parliament passed in the 6th of George L1. the ancient parish of St. Olave, Southwark, was divided into the two present parishes of St. Olave and St. John. It was thereby enacted that all charity lands, &c., at that time belonging to the parish of St. Olave should be divided into fifths, of which three should be applied to the sole use of the old parish, and out of the remaining two-hfths 26t. should be paid to the old parish, the residue to belong to the new parish. At the time of passing that Act part of the parish lands of St. Olave consisted of a narrow strip of waste land lying between the south side of Tooley-street and the property of the appelauts. It was not known in what manser the parish derived its title to the ground, but it was appropriated to the benefit of the parish in generaL In 1790 the appellants purchased the saidA stripkof land from the rector, parochial officers, and parishioners of the two parishes in consideration of an annuity of 151., which they regularly paid up to 1847, when the officers of the above parishes refused to receive it. The respondents theu sought to set aside the purchase by the appellants on the ground that the land was parish land dedicated to charity, and an information was accordingly filed on the 31st of January, 1852, by the Attorney-General, at the relation of some, on behalf of all, the inhabitants of those parishes, for the purpose of annuling the sid purchase. The appellants in their answer contended that the purchase was a valid purchase for value, and could not be upset, and that even if the purchase was invalid the Statute of Limitations prevented the respondents obtaining the relief they sought. - The Master of the Xolls, before whom the case was heard in March, 1854, decreed in favour of the respondents, being of opinion that the deed of conveyance was not effectual as an alienation of charity property, that the statute did not apply to charity trusts, and that the statute constituted no bar to relief prayed by the information of the Attorney-Gencral. From this decree the appelants had appealed to their Lordships' House. The cause was argued some short time ago, when their Lordships deferred giving their judgment. The LosD ChAxcELLos, in delivering his opinion in this case, said that as regarded the first point, as to whether the purchase was a valicd purchase, he entirely agreed with the Maaster of the Rlolls that it was not; for although he did not know of any express law to prevent the sale of charity estates, it was a very unusual proceeding, and it could not be carrying out the intentions of the persons who had given the estates for the purposes of charity to alienate them by sale. With regard to the second iDaint, as to whether the Statute of Limitations applied to charity as well as other lands and trusts, he (the Lord Chancellor) differed from the opinion expremed by the hlaster of the ltolls, as he saw nothing in the words of the statute to prevent its application to charity lands. As to the last point, which raised the question whether the Statute of Limitations appled to informations filed by the AttorneyGeneral, he (the Lord Chancellor) thought that the Attorney-General merely appeared as the representative of the poor of the two paishes, and that he was bound by the same law as they were. As it was clear that the poor of those parishes could not themselves have obtained the relief prayed for in equity, neither could the ttorneyaGeneral'as representing them obtain it. Under these circum stances the decision of the Court boelow must be reversed and the appeal allowed. Baron WERSLEYD.ALE concurred. Appeal allowed accordingly.
LA FEP0ORT. VICE-CHAENCELLOR'S COJRI' .TTnx 15 ROBSON V. TTIT. MAR. A nT --- (Before Vice-Chancdlor Sir JnonN IR-PITAW lI The hearing of this cause, which has occupied so much of the time of the Court during the present and last week, was this day brought to a close. An effectual check was pro. bably put to the length of the speeches of those counsel who addressed the Court to-day by the circumstance of the ViceChanceUor having threatened to sit until the case was concluded de die itn dtem in the recess between the term just ended and the sittings which will commence on the 22d inst., and by his having so far carried that threat into execution as to sit to-day. The case alleed by the plaintiff in his bill and at the bar was as follows :-In April, 1852, the Earl of Devon and certain others of the defendants assisted in the formation of a scheme to establish a mining association on the cost. book principle for raising gold and other metals in Australia, to be caUed the * Melbourne Gold and General MUining Association." In one of the prospectuses issued by the company it was stated, among other things, that the company was to be conducted on the cost-book principle; that it was to consist of 100,000 shares, on which a deposit of 11. per share was to bo paid on allotment; that no deed was to be signed; that the hability was to be hmited to the amount pald; that aU moneys would be returned without deduction unless adequate capital ahould be subscribed; and that by the constitution of the company on the cost-book principle there was an absence of all personal responsibility, unless expressly assumed by parties themselves, and the limitations of all claimus to the assets of the company. Shares to the amount of 105,000 were applied for by the public, but the committee of management, of which the Earl of Devon was the chairman, in the exercise of their judgment, allotted only about 3(),000 shares, and of the number so allotted a deposit of 11. per share was paid only in respect of 1,918. The company, therefore, received by way of deposit on the allotment of shares the sum of 1,9181. only. The managing committee never. theless determined to proceed with their scheme, and to effect that object they were desirous of obtaining a loan on the security of the company's shares, and also tho quota. tion of those shares in the official list of the Stock-Exchange, as well as the appointment of a settling day for the shares. It was alleged by the plaintiff that the managing committee employed one Robert George Moore as their agent to effect the above purposes, and that Moore, in concert with one Edwin Howard Tripp, a sharobroker, devised a scheme with a view to their accomplishment, and that that scheme was embodied in a letter dated May 3, 1352, and addressed to the Earl of Devon. In order that the shares might be quoted in the Stock-Exchange share list it was necessary to satisf the committee of the Stock-Exchange that two-thirds or the shares of the company were allotted, and the deposit thereon paid. The main features of Moore's alleged soheme were directed to rsatisfying the requirements of the committee of the Stock-Exchange, and it was described by him to be of such a nature as that it would *involve no money payment" on thea part of the company, and " only a limited risk of sbares, which," he added, " was not unreasonable for the service proposed to be rendered." It was further alleged to be a part of Mloore's scheme " to rig the market," a process by which an apparent demand for shares in a company is created, so as to give them a fictitious value. It was also alleged on the part of the plaintiff that Mloore's letter of the 3d of May, 1852, was read on thatday to the committee of,management of the company, and that the proposal therein contained was approved by them and a minute to that effect was endorsed upon the letter by 3ioore. In pursuance, as it was further alleged, of the arrangement contained in the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, Tripp on the 15th of that month caUed on the plaintiff, who is a stock-broker, and represented to him that Moore and one Scotthorn, who was the esgineer of the comany, weredesirousof borrowing 5001. onthe security of 1,000saares held by them therein, and on which shares a deposit of 1?. per share had been paid. The plaintiff, in ignorance of the plan contained in the letter of the 3d of May for procuring a settling day on the Stock-Exchange for the shares of the c )mpany, paid Moore and Scotthorn 5001., and as a security for its repayment they deposited with him the certificates of the before-mentioned 1,000 shares. Those shares, it was aieged by the plaintiff, were not the property of Moore and 8cotthorn, butt had been dPepros_ietedy boyf them as -the agents of the Managing committee of the company, and to effect the purposes contained in the letter of the 3d of May, 1852. The bill also alleged that a day or two after the 15th of May, 1852. and in further pursuance of the arrangement of the 3d of May, 1852, Moore and Tripp called at the plaintiff's office and renuired him to procure for Moore some shares in the company not exceeding 1,200 in number for the day of settlement at any price not exceeding 11. 2s. 6d. ptr share, to pay for which Moore undertook by a memoran. dum in Writing of the 18th of May, 1852, to provide the plair,tiff with cash before the settlement, and in case Moore Jailed to do so he authorized the plaintiff to sell the shares purchased by him at the best price obtainable to close the Transaction. Moore further undertook by the memorandum before-mentioned "from time to time to deposit with the plaintiff scrip certificates for paid-up shares in the proportion of one to every two shares purchased by the plaintiff as a security in case Moore did not provide the plaintiff with cash as before named to pay for the said shares purchased, or any difference between the price at wbich they had been bought and sold, and of the plaintiff's commission of 6d. a share on the purchase, ard a further 6d. a share if sold, which commissions 'were to be payable on the day of settlement, and in ease Hoore did not provide the plaintiff with cash to pay the said difference and the commissions of the latter, the former authorized the latter to sell so many of the shares depasited with the latter as would be sufficient to pay the iferences and commissions; but the shares were not to be otherwise sold withLout Moore's order." Tripp also undertook that he would be responsible to the plaintiff for any loss which the latter might inur a i relation to the ur chase of the 1,200 shares mentioined iin the document of the 18th of May, 1852. Pursuant to the instructions contained iii that document, the plaintiff, at various times betwdee the 18th of May, 1852, and the end of the following month of June, purchased for Moore 1,200 Fhares in the company at different prices, some being purchased at par and the rest I at 2s. &d. and Is. 3d. premium. The cost of these purchases, including commission and a loss of 5U1. 6s., occasioned by a faIlure on the Stock. Exchange,amounted to 1,3981.,whioh the plaintffpaid outof his ownpocket. The plaintiff alleged that be nade the before-mentioned purchases in the full belief that they were bondfide purchasez by Moore, but that they 'were no such thing, and that they were made by Moore and Tripp in furtherance of the plan of the 3d of May, 1852, and as the agents and on bebalf of the managing committee of the company, and by their authority. The plaintiff had sold 200 out o the 1,200 shares purchased by him, and had received as the proceeds of such sale the sum of 931. 155, The bill alleged that tho loan of 5001. was made and the 1,200 shares were purchased in pursuance of the scheme agreed upon by the managing committee of the company in concert with Moore, Scotthorn, and Tripp, and that those transactions were a fraud upon the plaintiff, and it prayed that they might be set aside on the ground of fraud, and that the defendants might be ordered to repay to the plain. tiff the sum of 5001., with interest, from the 15th of May. 1852, and the whole of the purchase-money for the 1,200 shares, with interest on such purchase-money, after allowing for the snm of 931. 15s., the plaintiff being willing and offering to delver up the shares in his possession. General Chatterton, one of the defendants, in bis affidavit said, " I consented to and did become a member of the committee of the association." " I never took any prorminent part in the company, and scarcely attended the meetings of the committee of the comPany." "I never beld a share, or sold or bought one, and I never saw one." The solicitor to the company, in his cross-examination, [also said that as far as he knew none of the gentlemen named on the Committee of Management set forth in the prospectus took any sbares in the company. AU the members of the Committee by their answers denied having any recollectlon of the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, and General Chatterton and the company's solicitor denied that it ever was read or produced; all the members of the committee also denied that they ever gave authority to Moore or any other person to carry out such a scheme as there described. Mr. MALINsand .Hr. G. L. RUSSELL, for the plaintiff contended that the representations made by the prospectus -viz., that the capital was to consist of 100,000 shares of 11. each, and that if adequate capital were not subscribed the money would be returned, brought the case, under the circumstances, within well-known authorities both at law and in equity, by which anyone making a representation, not knovwing it to be true,or knowing it to be false, to the injury of another, was bound to make good the representation; andthat the mere fact of issuing any shares whatever before adequate capital was subscribed and paid was a false repreo BeDtation within the terms of the prospectus. Mr. WIGRA3r and Mr. E. F. Ss5TII, on behalf of the defendant, General Chatterton, and Mr. BACON and Mr. STEVENS for Lord Devon, argued upon the evidence that Moore and Tripp were not the agents of the otherdefendants, or m any way authorized to effect the loan or to order the purchase of the shares. They further insisted that no case of fraud had been substantiated against the defendants. Mr. CRAIG and Mr. Dn L. GIFFARD, for Messrs. Quin and Douglas, contended that the Court would give relief only where a case of " moral fraud" had been proved, and cited numerous cases in support of the proposition. Mr. J. N. HIGRoms, for two other members of the committee, contended that from the circumastances the plaintiff must be taken to have known the doubtful and speculative character Of both the transactionsimpugned, or, at allevents, that he purposely abstained from inquiries which would have suggested tnemselves to any pudent man, and espe, cially, under the circumstances otthe case, to one o was a stock-broker. r. Valker, lMr. Baggallay, Mr. Osborne, and lr. Smythe for other defendants. The VICE-CIANCELLOR said, that he hoped tho time would never come when anybody who proved against a defendant a case of fraud should fail to get relief, and the plaintiff in this case said he had been defrauded by Mr. Moore, and that the transactions by means of which the fraud was perpetrated were conducted under the authority, it not on the instruction, of the other defendants. Whatever the case might be as against Moore, it was the duty of the Court to consider what the case was as against the other defendants, who were brought before the Court not as direct parties to the fraud, but as principals who perpetrated the fraud through their agent the fist material circumstance which the plaintiff had to prove was the employment of Moore by the other defendants to enter into that transaction by which the plaintiff had sustained his loss. In order to prove that, it was essential to the plaintiff's case, in any view of it, that he should rove that the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, was, if not read, so dealt with in the presence of the other defendants as that they were cognizant of its contents and authorized Moore to do the thing which he proposed by that letter. On this part of the case, which lay at the root of the whole of it, there was a direct conflict of evidence, and the most favourable view to the plaintiff which he could form was that the case was, at least, doubtfuL Where charges offraud were alleged they ought to be proved by the clearest evidence, and be could not take it as proved that the contents of the letter of the 3d of May, 1852, were communicated to the defendants, or that there was such evidence as would justify the Court in dealing with the case as if that fact was proved. That, indeed, disposed of the whole case, but he could not dismiss It without commenting upon some of the other parts of the case. The question, then, arose was the proposal one to commit a fraud. Even assuming that the letter had been communicated to the defendants, the managing committee of the company, he saw nothing in it betraying any moral turpitude or any fraud to complain of. But further, what had been done between the plaintiff and Moore was not what had been proposed in the letter or authorized by it. Supposing, however, that that letter bad directed Moore, Scotthorn, and Tripp, to do what they were stated to have done, had the plaintiff acted with that degree of prudence and caution which he ought to have exercised X The rule of law was that, where common prudence and caution were smicient to guard a man, the law would not protect him if negligent, and here he could not consider that the plaintiff had used that caution and diligence which he ought to have done. With respect to the miemorandum of the 18th of May, 1852, hethought that it pointed to trasactions hlich were evidently not in the ordinary and legitimate course of business, as had been suggested by Mr Higgins, and the plaintiff himself by the course that he had adopted had made himself a party to that very process of rigging the market of which he complained. The rule of the Court was elear, that where fraud was alleged and not proved the plaintiff must pay the costs of the suit, but'in this case he was at first disposed to depart from that rule in consequence of the want of prudence shown by the defendants. The plaintiff, however, both in hiB bill and at the bar had made such strong allegations of fraud against the defendants whioh he had v'holly failed to prove, that the binl must be dismissed with costs against all the defendants, not excepting Moore and Tripp,
COURT OF QUEENS BENCH, WEsT3rr-STmR JuNE 13. CIIARLES V. 'THE NATIONAL GUARDIAN ASSURACE COMPANY. 14utn)U n Banco, ater Term, before Mr. Jutice COLE. RIDGE, Mr. Justuce MRLE, and MIr. Justice CROm ToN.) The Court sat in Banco this day, and took several cames in the new trial naner. This was an action upon a policy of life insurance which had been effected with the National Assurance Company. At the trnal the plaintiff obtained a verdict for 5001., but eubsecinently a rule was granted to reduce the verdict to 1.lOs., or to enter a verdict for the defendant. The chief point for the defendant was, that the contract was not under Mr. EI. Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Tomlinson were heard to show cause against the rule; anda mr Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Hindinarch, andaMr. As~plana inx its support. hlr. Justice ERLE said, he was of opinion that the rule should be made absolute, so far as the reduction of the damages was concerned, and discharged as to the contention that there was no evidence to support the contract alleged in the declaration. In the course of the evidence there were al the circumstances preceding the making of a valid contract, and that would foUow after, sueh as the proposal, the acceptance, the receipt of premiums from time to time. and, when the life had terminated, there was the admission that they were bound by the contract. But a defence was then set up by the company which turned out to be untrue. If, therefore, it was possible, by presumption, to show that a company completely registered could be bound, there wassauperabundance of evidence. It was not the duty of the plaintiff to bring all possiblo evidence that could be suggested, and it was not necessary in all cases to produce the deed. (" Smith v. the Hull Gas Company.") This was not a corporation at common law, but a statutable company, which might contract otherwise than under seaL There was fuU power for the directors to enter into a oontract in this form, if sanctioned by the deed; and that would be presumed unless the contrary were proved. This was, therefore, a binding contract on the company. Mr. Justice CRourrTON said, he thought the contract in question was made In such a way as to be binding on the comiany; the company had done acts which showed that it was inding on them. The COURT directed that the verdict for the plaintiff should stand for 3911. lOs. At 3 o'clock this day, Mr. H. SILL reminded the Court that it was Saturday, ut their LordBhip8 for some time turned a deaf ear to the suggestion, At length, finding it " impossible" to proceed with another case to any advantage, their Lordships rose. (Sittivgs at Nisi Prius before Mr. Justice WIGHTSW and Special Juries.) This was the first day of the sittings at Westminster after Trinity Term; the list contained an entry of 69 causes, of which 22 were remanets and 24 were marked as special ]pines, THE QUEEN V. FArIRRIE AND OTIERS. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. Bodkin, and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the prosecution; lAr. BoviU and Mr. EIoneyman epresented the defendants The defendants, Messrs. Fairrie, are sugar refiners in Whitechapel. The indictment charged them with having erected near a public street certain furnaces for burning animal charcoal, from which divers noxious smels and vapours arose; they were further charged with placing animal charcoal in a heated state near the public streets and pouring water on it, fromfwhich noxious vapours arose; other counts stated that the nuiance had been commenced by other persons, butgthe defendants had continued it. The defendaints pleaded "Not Guilty." Mr.Serjeant BYLE.S stated that the defendants were gentlemaen of great respectability, and he was n3ot instructed to Fay a word derogatory to their charter, hut the prosecution had been instituted by the Whiterbapel Board of Woi disebargekndschae opubli oduty. Thebusine cofmalsugar refiner was in itself perfectly innocuous, but in the coiur of the processthesyrup-whichhadbeen produced by boiling down the coarse sugar was passed through vessels filled with animal charcoal, in order to puirify it. The effect was that the liquaid which before was the colour of porter becamne perfectly pellucid and limpid. .Animal charcoal was used, as it dischiarged the irmpurities of the sugar more completely than wvood charcoal. After the charcoal had been once used it became necessary to burn it to get rid of the impurities collected from the sugar. This was a most noxious process; it had formely been a separate business, kid the Eugar refiners had lately commenced to do it for tbemselves, and Messrs. Fairnie, vbose refinery was in Church-lane, had taken premises in Back Church-lane for the purpose. The quantity burnt was about 130 or 140 tons a-week. It appeared that in the course of the process some mostnoxiousgases, amongotheracarbonic oxide,were evolved. The effects produced on the persons in the neighbourhood were I rostration of the vital powers, loss of appetite, sickmaess, andnausea; andthe meat ia the batohers'7shops becare tainted. The district was very thickly populated, but the people were of a class unable to help themselves, and nothing was done until the district board was constituted - they gave directions to have the defendants summoned before the magistrates at Arbour-square. They were convicted in a snmall penalty; but as the nuisace still contiuued the present proecution was instituted. Mr. John Liddle said.-I am medical officer to the board of health of the district. I have visited the defendants' premises complained of. They have been inn ossession of them about sixyears. My first visit was the 7th of April,1856. bn the refinery the charcoal is placed in large vessels. The sugar is poured on It and percolates through. The charcoal then becomes charged with all the impurities of the sugar. These impurities can only be got rid of by burning. ror this purpose the charcoal is taken from the refinery to the burmag house. The smell arising from the process is mostdisgreeable. Itproduice nause and sickness. found the same effecti, although n a less degree, when passing she premises. The nelabbourhood is a very popuous one. There is a shaft about 45 feet high, to carry off the vapours, but it is not sufftcient, as the premises aro not in very good repair, some windows are broken and some tiles off. 1 have received frequent complaints of these smells from the inhabitants of the neigbbourhood. I wrote to the defendants on the subject, and made several verbal communications. I stated itwas a nuisance. The defendants denied that any nuisance arose. Some diminution of the annoyance has taken place within the last two months. I was there this week, and found the noxious vapour still given off. Cross-examined by Mr. BovIL-I have been medical officer of the union for many years. I have gone to persons in the district to ask whether it was not a nuisance; some said it was, others it was not. There is no nuisance from the sugar refinery. I have heardthere is a place immediately .adjoining defendants', where old rags are burnt. I do not know whether there are any pigs kept there, nor whether there is a manufactory of cotton waste. I do not believe the sewers are particularly offensive; the district is not par. ticularly remarkable for offensive smells. When I was at the premises last week the smell outside was not'very bad, but It was injurious to health. When the sugar is poured on the charcoal it is dark coloured, but I cannot say that it has any other imparities. By burning the charcoal the vegetable matter which it received from the sugar is carried off. Iam not awarethat animal charcoal is used as a preservative of health; it is used to prevent infection. If the cnarcoal was burnt before the sugar was passed through it, there would be no noxious smelL Mrs. Susan Racionas stated she resided at the back of defendant's premises, and bad suffered the greatest inconvenience for the last three years; up to that time she had been strong and healthy. The smell from the factory had produced a sick headache. If she wentto the dooror opened the window after her meals she became quite sick. It was impossible to keep the window open if the wLad blew from the factory. Cross-examined by Mr. Bovrnr.-She worked at her husband's business, who was a slipper maker. The doctor had not told her she was suffering from an internal complaint. The smell was as bad as ever last Thursday. She communicated with the attorney to the Board of Works in February last. lary MIay keeps a publichouse in Baccburch-lane. The smell from the defendsnts' premises was most offensive. It ,requently made her sick. Othermembers of her famiy were also affected. Cross-examined.-She had never made any complaint to Messrs. Fairrie. There had been no dispute between her and their men about taling coke. Several other persons residing in the neighbourhood gave similar evidenee as to the nuisance arising from the defendants' premises, and the ill effects produced on them by it ; and about five years ago they had petitioned the vestry of Whitechapel on the subject, but nothing was done. One witness, a butcher, stated that not even the pigs could stand It. The evidence on this branch of the case occupied the entire day, and was not completed when the Court rose, up to which time over 30 witnesses had been examined.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WESTbxsTEIL TlInm l.t (siwinga at NUi Prius, after Tern, before Mr. Juw1ic CItOWDER and Common Juries.) This was the fixt day of the Sittings after Term. The causeo list contains an entry of 36 causes, of which 10 are marked for special juries. The causes tried to.day were not such as would warrant any report, an action for an illegal distress of some sulphate of lime occupying the greater pat of the day.
COURT OF EXCHEOUER. SATMDAV .T1T 1V4 (Sitings at Nisi Prius, before i-r. Baron BRrAWXLL.) The entry for these sittings oonsists of six revenue causes, 25 special jury, and 32 common jury causes. HUGHES V. BOOTH. Mr. Atherton and Mr. Joseph Brown were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Collier and Mr. Garth appeared for tho defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover 1001., the amount paid by him as deposit into the hands of the defendant on the oconsionof his selling the lease of a house to the plaintiff. Tho defendant is an auctioneer, and it appeared that the house was sold for 5451 at a rent of 51., but when the abstract of the title was deiiveredit was ascertaiued for the first time that the lease of the house was subject to a covenant or stipulation, that in the event of anv trade or business being carried on the defendant should psi an additional rent of 601. per month. The defendant being an artificial florist, and desiring to carry on that oocupation in the house in question, declined to complete the contract and brought the present action to recover the deposit. The learned JUDGE told the jury that the covenant was inhis opinion quite unusaal, and directed themif they agreed in that view of t"he case to find averdict for the plaintiff. The jury at onee returned a verdict for the elaintiff ior 1001., for vvhich the verdict was entered, subject to a bill of exceptions, which was tendered on Iis Lordship's ruling. BEVAN V. TAGG. fr Serjeant BaUantine and Mr. Joyce appeared for tbe plaintiff- Mr. Serieant Pio,tt and Mr. Thompson weie counsel for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant for the wrongful conversion of certain goods and furniture, to which the defendant pleaded " Not Guilty," leave and license, and a denial that tbe goods in question were the property of the plaintiff. It appeared that the plaintiff had taken a house at a yearly rental of 101. from the brother of the defendant at Heinley, and that, having been obliged to move to London, he quitted Henley andgave directions to his wife to bring up his furniture, at the same time informing his landlord that he had experienced heavy losses, and suggesting that a new tenant might be obtained. Mrs. Bevan, on one Sunday evening removed her goods to a neighbour's house, whence they were placed in a carrier's cart next day. Before they left the town, owever, the defendant, who managed his brother's business for him, beard of this resnoval and signed a distress warrant on his brother's behalf and withhis authority, under whichhe causedthegoods to be distrained. The laintiffsworethatthe goods which still remained in the hands of the landlord were worth 40.; but one of the brokers who appraised them swore they were not worth more than 41. 10s. The defence to the action was, that the defendanthad not personally interfered with the goods so as to render himself liable for their conversion, having only acted as agent for the landlord, against whom the plaintiff ought to have proceeded if the proceedings were irregular, and also that the goods were not really worth more than 41. 10. Mr. Baron BRAMIWELL was of opinion that the defendant had rendered himself personally liable under the circum. ktances, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover such sum as the jury should say the goods were fairly wortb, the one sum being certainly too high a measure of their value, while the other was too Iow. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with 101. damages. EXCHEQUER CHAMBER. SATURDAY, JuNE 13. (Sittings in Error.-Present, Lord Chief Justice CocxBuRn and JustiCes WILLTUAS and WILLXs, and Lord Chief Baron POLLOCK, and Barons WATSog and CHANNEL.) MANSELL V. THE QUEEN. Mr. F. RUSSELL said, there was a case of Thomas Mansell in which he hbd an application to make to the Court. The plaintiff in error Thomas Mansell was convicted of murder at Maidstone, he had obtained a writ of error to the Court of Queen's Bench, where the judgment was affirmed, but a fresh writ of error bad been granted upon the fiat of the Attorney-GeneraL The record had been transcribed and broughtinto this court,andthe question now was asto the mode in which errors were to be assigned. The plaintiff was brought up for the purpose of assigning errors if the Court should think fit. The application, therefore, was that the plaintiff in error should be permitted to assign errors, and that the assignment should be filed with the officer of the Court. The question turned upon this, whether the rules that regulated civil cases in this court applied to cases of felony. Lord Chief Justice COCi3URN asked if the rules did not apply to civil cases only ? MIr. RuSSZLL did not think they did. It had been decided that the statute which constituted this Court gave power to deal with writs of error in cases of felony. The CHins' BABoN.-What is the statute under which this Court was constituted? Mr. RussELL said, it was the 1st of WiUiam IV., cap. 70, section 8. The question was how error was to be assigned. The principle of the criminal law was that the party charged must be present in court. The CuiEF B.RoN.-It may be that some officer is acquainted with what the practice was before the establishmnent of this Court ? Mr. RUSSELL said, before the establishment of this Court the Court of Error had no jurisdiction in criminal cases. Mr. Baron WATSoN.-The practice in the Queen's Bench 'was to bring him into court, and in person he assigned errors. In Corners Crozon Cases it was laid down that the plaintiff must assign errors in person, and a writ of Habeas Corpus had been obtained, and the plaintiff was present. Lord Chief Justice Cocinunx did not think the Court need trouble Mr. Russell with a consideration of the rules. This Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine writs of error from the Queen's Bench. This was one. The prisoner was brought up for the purpose of assigning errors. Mr. RuSSELL said, it might be important to know what time errors should be aesigned. The CHrF BARON inquired whether any one was present on the part of the Crown. Mr. RSSsELL said, he had informed Mr. Welsby that he wes goingl t-o ayply to the Court. LordCbief ustice CoOCrVRN said that, from a communication he had had, Mr. Welsby hd not aanticipated that the prisoner would be brought up to-day. When did the leaned counsel propose to assign errors. Mr. RUSSELL.-NoW, in Court, if their lordships thought ,that was the prosr course. The COVBT.-It is clear that the counsel of the Crown ought to be present when errors.are assigned, that he may know what course he would take. Mr. RuSSELL ad he waa told it ws not neceary. The Cnxss JusTIcF.-WhichO would you prefer, MKr. Russell, to assig errors to-day, or to wait til Monday? Mr. Russtih had rather wait till Monday. TIhe CB339' JUJSTICE.-You have no obj,,ction to this course being taken that theprisoner shouldheb remanded and brought up on Monday. henletthe prisonor be remandec to Maxidstone, and brought up on Monday at U o'clock. PEMBERTON V. CIAPMAN. This case had been part heard at the last sittings Sir P. Kelly not having concluded his argtument. Mr. UiTHA.EN now asked the Court to postpone the further argument till Monday, as Sir F. Kelly was absent, being engaged upon some other busIness upon an arrange. mnent which he had made before he knew of the CouLrt sitting to-day. The LoRs Cn= JusTicR shook his head and ask2ed where sir F. Relly was. Mr. UNTHANK believed he was at a compensation case. The Cmii- JusTicn said thtat the Court could not allow ia case to be so postponed because the counsel was attending scompenutioncase. It was notconsistent with thec ignity of the Court. The Court would take time to consider its i UsenTe xsaid he had not 'known that the Court would hear him when Sir F. Key hd concluded part of his argament. The CHxIE JUSTooim-If yon were prepared to go on we would most willingly have heard -you, and we are sur the argument would have lost nothing. The day of the sitting of the Court was announced more than a fortnight ago, and we ought not npow to be told that the counsel is engaged in a compensation case. M1r. U.?rnwsx then said he would prepare himself if the Court would hear him after the next case. The Cmxi- Jusvcx.-As a peronal matter of consideration for youx we wil permit you, Mr. 'Unthank to argue after the conclusion of the next case. Mr.B. LAE sidhe ope te csewould not be taken ally thatit is to ndotodaay COHEN V. VWEGHS' AND OTHERs. The qestion raised in this case 'was whether an agent -who had not authority to act as such fox- another was Ifable for his acts. The Couteof Queen's Bench had held that he WAS liable. It was then brought to thiscourt. Mr. Pmrsox contended that the agenit was not liable; M1r. O'Maley argued that he was liable. The COURT took time for consideration. PEMBHRTONT V. CHPMAN. Mr. UThiRAwu was then heard. The CouRT took time to consider Its judgment.
ADMlIRLTY COURT. SATfRTrAVZ .TMM 1R !rrnC (lvRrq (Before Dr. LusHaGTON and tae TRTy MAusr&) This was a suit for damage brought by the owners of the barge Harmony and of the cargo laden therein, and by the master and crew thereof for their private effects, against the screw steamuship Cres The case of the barge was that about 4 am. of the 12th of October last she was about half a mile above the Nore light on a voyage from LondontoFaversham, steering southeast by south, under mainsail, foresaiL jib, topsail, and mizen; the wind was extremely light from the noithward; the tide about half-ebb; and the barge made little more than driftway; that the night was very dark and drizzling; all three hands were on deck and keeping a good look-out;. a glass lantern, with an oil lamp, which showed a bright light all round, was standing lighted on the locker in the cabin, witbin reach of the master at the helm. That in this state ofcircumstanoes the red light of a steamer (the Ceres) was observed broad on the barge's port bow, distant above a mle, and steering far to the aorthward of the barge, which therefore continuedher course withQut alteration; that three or four minutes after the red Ught had been seen the green light suddenly opened and showed the steamer to have starboarded and to be coming direct for the barge ' whereupon the master instantly took the lantern from tbe locker and held it high up towards tbe steamer, at the same time putting the helm hard a-port, which, owing to tholightness of the wind produced little or no effect; that all hands shouted to the steamer, but she continued her course without alteration andin about three or four minutes after the green light had been seen aud the barge's light exhibited ran stem on into the barge's midships, in consequence whereof the barge presently sunk; that the collision was solely attributable to the Cares not having kept a proper look out and taken other necessary precautions to keep clear of the barge. The defenoe of the Ceres was tlhat on arriving at the entrance to the l'hames on her voyage from Rotterdam the, morning became so dark and thick with drizzling rain that it was impossible to distinguish vessels of small tonnage until close upon them, although avery goodand careful look out was being kept on board the Ceres ; that consequentlv the master ordered her to be brought up, to await daylight or a change of weather; that prepartory to letting go ner anchor her helm was put the starboard to haul her to the southward, that almost immediately after this had been done the light of the Harmony was suddenlyexhibited right ahead, at the distance of about 200 feet only from the teamer, whereupon the helm of the steamer, then a-starhoard, was put hard astarboard, and her engines eased and stopped; but before the engines could be reversed she struck the Harmony,wbich was ooming down with the ebb tide, on her port side near the mast; that having taken the crew of the barge on board the steamer was brought untill daylight; that the collision was occasioned by theHarmony not having exhibited a light in sufficient time to enable the steamer to avoid the collision. Dr. Bayford and Dr. Deane appeared for the Harmony; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss for the Ceres, Dr. LusirGToN (addressing the Trinity Masters),Gentlemen, I must in the first instance request your attention to the case of the barge. The question for your con. sideratiaon will be whether there has been on her part any violation of the rule laid down by the Lords of the Ad miralty, "that all sailingvessels, when under sail or being towed, aproaching, or being approached, by any other vessel shal show between sunset and sunrise a bright hght in such a position as can be best seen by such vessel or vessels, and in sufficient time to avoid a collision ;" for there is a provision in the statute that if a collision be occasioned by the non-observance of this rule, in that case the owners of the vessel violating the rule shaU never recover any damages whatever, either in this or any other court. The question therefore is whether there has ben any departure from or violation of the rule, according to its trae interpretation. It is admitted on behalf of the barge that she did see the red light, and that she did not then show a light. If that is a violation of the rule then she is out of court. But, looking at aU the circnmstances of the case, the relative position of the two vessels and their respective courses, could they be said to be approaching within the true meaning of the rule? The couras of the barge was S.E. by S.,andthesteamer's, thoughitisnot specifically stated, must, Iapprehend, have been to the northward of W. Under these circumstances, then, the barge descried the red light; and it seems clear that if she saw the red light on her port bow and the courses of the vessels were as stated, these vessels would have gone well clear of each other. The important question for you to determine wiU be whether there was any departure from the rule in its true meaning, or whether " approaching or being approached by any other vessel" does not mean or refer to vessels in the relative positions in which these two vessels were. This is the first branch of the question. The next point is, if there has been no violation of the rule in the barge's not exhibiting a lightwhen the red light only of the steamer was visible, whether she did as soon as posAble after the appearance of the green light exhibit her light to the steamer. If so, then the barge is not to blame. Then, as to the conduct of the steamer. According to her statement, the night being so very dark she deemed it prudent to come to anchor, and for that purpose she starboarded her helm to bring her to the southward of mid-channel. Whether that was a proper measure to adopt, you, gentlemen, are the best judges; but it seems clear that before adopting such a measure she ought to have taken the greatest possible precaution, and have seen that it was clear of vessels all around before she so deviated from her course, The question therefore will be whether, if she had taken such due precaution, she might not have seen the light of the barge in sufficient time to have avoided tho collision. After having retired with the Trinity Macters, The learned JUIDGE said,-The gentlemen by whom the Court is assisted are of opinion that, looling at all the circumstanees of the case and the direction in which the red light was seen from the barge, she was not caUed upon to show a ight until after the green light became visible. They also think that the barge did show a light as soon after the green light appeared as she could, and that she has not violated the rule. They are further of opinion that the steamer should have eased her speed, and that if desirous of .oming to the northward in order to come to anchor, she should have done so more cautiously, and have eased her speed. I must therefore pronounce for the damage. This was a suit for damage brought by the owners of the bark Midlothian apmst the Ecrew steamer 'Urania. The collDon occurred about 10 p.m. of the 18th of February last, 15 or 16 miles to the eastward of the mouth of the Humber. The bark alleged that she was steering S.E. by S., closehauled on the starboard tack, under aU plain sall with the wind S.W.byS. ; had aclear, brightregulation-lightburningbrightly atherbourprit-end, and new white sails, plainly visible at the distance of a mile, andthat itwas a fine, clear, starlight night; th&t the red light of the Urania was seen upwards of three miles to windward, and nearly abeam of the bark, vhich vas then kept as close to the wind as she would lie so as to remain under command; that thered light was attentively watched tiU it was within a mile and the smoke of the steamer was visible; that the mate then took a clear signal lantern, burning brightly, from the top of the binnacle, and held it up over the starboard quarter, and at the same time shonted to the steamer; that, nevertheless, the steamer ran violently stem on into the starboard side of the bark, abaft the forerigging, and did her very considerable damage; that the collision was attri. butable to the Urania in not keeping clear of the Midlothian, by going astern of her or otherwise. The Urania, in defence, alleged that she was steering north and by west, making about six knots only, the night being cloudy and so'dark that a vessel without a light could be seen but at a very short distance; that suddenly a light, ap arently then just held up on board the vessel, became visi le from one to two points on the Urania's port bow, where neither light nor vessel had previously been visible, although a vigi lant look out had been kept; that the Urania's helm was immediately put hard sport, but that the bark had approached her so close before showing the light that a collision bad become inevitable; that bn this being seen, as it was almost immediately, by those on board theUraia, her engines were ordered to be stopped and reversed foull speed, for the purpose of easing the blow, being the only step that could thenbo taken by the Urania; but that, notwithstand. ing, the Midlothian ran athwart hawso of the Urania at the late of five oreixknots,andwithher starboard side struck the steamer's stem with such violenee s to turn it towards the starboardibow,didbothvesseisdamage,andthenwvntolear. In contradiction to the plea of the dlotbian she alleged that the night was not fine nor clear, norAaright;thatthebark had not a clear, nor bright, nor any regtiution light, bat a lamp only with three glasses of different colours, which heather was nor could b. seen by the tUrafiimnitb eati h were doeo together, &ad that the s.x bo the bark were not visibl at a mile's distanoe- that the sobe blame of:the ,i. lision is attributLble to ~ieMidlothian in not 4iaving q- hibited in urusuace ef the Adm ity reg i t effect a bright light in apoition whence it cotxld bebest seen by those on board th UlJwia in- sufficient time to enable them to avoi4 a colDion. Dr. Bayford, and Dr. Deane a for the brk; Dr. Addameand Dr. Twlss. for the Urania. Dr. Lus}GTOrN(dresaind theTrin g steis).-GN. tlemen, it was contended by Dr. Addtms that the statement of the Midlothian was so inconsident, and improbable that it could not poibly be believed, and he supported that ar. gument by reference to numerus pwsges m the evidence. If 7ou are of the sameopinion you will, of courae, satethat Opiion to me. 3y own view however, is that it aPpear from the evideucetbat the Midlothu n close-hauled upon the starboard tack, anteing about S.E. by S. The correct oourse of the steamer would be tat h satats it, .'orth, andI byWestadsh wag proceeding at the rate of *six or sevenkotsan or Therei is no doubt, therefore, that the smer to b not hxing avoided this collision, unless it should apper that the mlalothian is to blame for n ig g n dentice to the ste-amer by the proper eaiiio falih.Itho pleadings Ithis point of the defence i" stated biefly, "that the coll$son is impu. table to teon board the idlothian in not having exhi bited, in pursuance of the AdmLirlty regulations a bright light, in a position whence it couldbebest seen on board the Urania in sufficient -time to enable themt to, avoid the co0lision." The queBtioniis whetherormot the Midloth did show, in complianoe with the Admirialty regulations a sufficient light in sufficient timae. It is not duisputed tat she had the lantern which we have seen exhibited tht moming suspended at her bowsprit end. -I can form no opinion whether that is a sufficient light, or whether its being suspended there was a compliance with the Admiralty regulations. That question is for you to determine, and, as t appears to sae, mUUSin a great measure depend.upon the relative position ofth two vessels, for whatever may be the dimness or in1suficiency of the two coloured lights at the ideif he essls ereend -on the white light woulc4 thenbe isile.Ifyou are of opinon that suchi a light Is suficint,an exibiedin complianoe wiXth the requie mnenofte dmat, the quesibon is at an end, cas ther sn ob hti a so exhibited in daetime.' If; however, you are of opinion that the light is lnsuffi cient then an&otherquestion arises-whether those on board the Mdoha i exhibit another bright light, and insufficient time. The onus of proving the a,rmative will, of course, lie upon the Midlothian, andl must say the evdne is very conflicting and unstatifacoWry, and not such as we had a xniht to expect. However, wJe must consider whether or not it does establish as a fact that they did show a sufficient light, and in duo time. The only other question argued is whether the Mldlothian was wront in starboarding her he.m, though I do not think that that question fairly arises in the case, inasmuch as it was not aleged in plea. After retiring with theTrinity faster the learned Judge said,-The Tzinity Wasters are of opinion that the light at the bowsprit end was not a aufficient light according to the Admiialty.requiremeontg, and we are allof opinion thaLt the affirmative is not proved by the MId& lothian, that she did exhibit a bright light in sufficient time.. At the' samne time we are of opinion that there was anLl absence of that vigilance on board the steamer which the circumstances re9uired. The result is that, notwithstand. mg the steamer 3s to blame, the Midlothian, being also tos blame for noncompliance with the Admiralty regulations, is barred of recovery by the statute. I must therefore dismiss the steamer, but under the circumstances shall give no costs.

Der4t,Alcroft, and Co., with intend to defaud them, was again brought up, and was sentenced to tbree months' imprisonment.

Bow.sTT.-Frederio Hildebrand, the "Ethiopian serenader," who had been remanded onbail onthe chargeof having caused the death of a gentleman named Rowland White by a blow given iz a street affray, appeaed in discharge of his recognizances. Ur. HNY inquired of Inspector Mitchellr whether any of the friends of the deceased were In attendance? Inspector Mitchell replied that they were not, but that they had attended at tho inquest, and that they were a2ware the examination was fixed for that day. Mr. HWNR said that was quite sufficient, and inquired whether the verdict had been correctly reported? ns or Mitchel.-Thd verdict was that RowlandWhite died of Inammation of the lungs, acclerated by a blow given by Frederic EEildebrand in self-defence. Ifr.Hrnsy.-] faUly concur in that verdict. I think the blow wlas given in self-defence. 1 shaUl discharge the prisoner, It appears thatthe statement made at the first examina. tfon, that MIr. White had been turned out of Jessop's winerooms in Catherine-street shortly before the aflFay, was n ot correct. James Geary was brought up for final examination on the oha; of attempting to kill his wife, Emily Geary, who now for the first time attended. She looked very pale, but gave no siga of weakness, and when offered a seat declined to acceet it, saying that she .could stand well enough." She said she had left the hospital that morning. She was married to the prisoner on the 4th of MAy. The quarrel took place on the 23d of May. It began at the corner of the street where her mother hved-Whitecross-street, city. She had been at hermother's and had met s woman there who lived with her brother. This womanwanted her (witness) to go home with her, and the prisoner would not let her. At the corner of the street she asked the prisoner to take her to a concert at a public. house in Old-street, St. Luke's. He refused, but offered to take her to one in Drury.lane, as that was nearer home. She said she would not go there. Prisoner then asked her to come home. She said she would not, and he rejoined, "Then, I will make you," upon which she sat down on a doorstep and refused to stir. He then said she must give him his money, and she returned him a half-crown and some halfpence which he had given her that day. After that, however, she went home, and stood at the street door for some time, refusing to go upstairs. At la she went up, and on entering the room told him that she would not live with him any longer, she would Bo away in tbo mornin He then laid hold of her Hehad a knife in his hand. He had been cutting wood with it. He stuck the knife in her throat, and then in his own. It was not in the room, but on the landing outside the room door that he used the knife. She did not faint, but she heard the constable say, " She has fainted," and they threw cold water in her face. It was entirely her own fault; she had been "aggravating" him all the week, but she thought that when they came out on the landing the landlady miight have saved it all. Ir. HENRY did not think there wFas the slightest ground for blaming the landlady, who had evidently done the best she could.~ ~ ~ ~~~~th bs Mfr. Christoper Heath, house surgeon at King's College Hospital, described the state in which he found the last witness on her admision to the hospital. She hbd four distinct wounds on the right side of the neck, one below the clavicle, two on the left side of the neck, and three on the back of the right hand. Her life was in danger for some time. During the first night he did not think she could xecover, but in the morning she rallied, and had been oin on well ever since. She was now out of danger. g The prisoner said,-I was trying to got a respectable living for her, and she was not satisfied. That is all I have to say. He was committed for trial. WEST srTEit.-M. Mforetz Aloert, Chancellor of the Prussian Legation, again attended at this court on Saturday respecting his charge against Willirm 3Gowan, the particulars of which wero detailed in our impression of last Monday. The case had been adjourned in order that it might receive the fullest investigation, and the accused set at liberty on his own recognizances, at the request of the complainant, that he might be enabled to procure the I O U for 100' which he stated he had received from the complainant, and witnesses in support of his statement. On the case Deing proceeded with, Mar. IGHAA inquired of X Albert whether he had brought any one who could speak to the fact of his not being in this country 19 years ago ? X Albert replied in the affirmative, and produced his brother.in.lr.w, who stated that he had known complainant 3O yeas.lIle was now 35 years of age, and in 183swata school at Berlin. Mr. LN(mA inquired of the defendant whether he had any witnesses. Defendant replied he had not. 31r. INGU:S asked whether ho had the I 0 U he had spo}en of ? Defendant replied he had not * he could not get it with. out going to Oxford, and he could not afford to do that. h Albert said, he had given the defendant credit in the frst nstance for being sincere in his belief that he was the Baron de Behr, but he had since learnt that the person so callng himself was a German Jew, who, after being in Van Diemen's Land as a convict, was nor in Australia undergoirga punishment for horsestealing. He of course did not eelflattered by being taken for that person, nor was there, i he was informed, the slightest resemblancebetween this person and himself. Mr. INGium observed that there was nothing even to show that any I 0 U was ever in existenoe; it rested entrely with complainant whether he would go onD with this charge. hL Albert (whose conduct throughout has been charac. terized by great good nature) said he did not wish to deprive the defendant of his liberty, but he thought it but reasonable that he should at once admit that be had made a greAt mistake in supposing thAt he ever pssed as the Baron de Belir. Defendant observedthat if bewas mistaken he voluntai withdrew all claim upon complainant. - Mr. INriTA thought it out of reason to say "if ie was mistaken," as it was impo6sible that X.

ELOPEpmrm EXTRAORDINARY.-On Wednesday evening, the 3d inst., a man and a woman arrived by rail at the Bridlington station, and made their way by omnibrs to an inn in the Market-place, where they took up their abode for the night as husband and wife, stating, among other things, they had been married two months, and had come to Brldlington to obtain work, the man as a labourer, and the woman in any way in which she conld be useful, especially in the stitching line. They had a large quantity of luggsge, comprising female attire and abundance of provlsions consistingof pies of various kinds and sizes, cheesecakes, tarts, ham, bread, a bottle of wine, &-c. They ate, drank, and were very merry, and the good people of the inn seemed greatly taken with theirnew guests, who intimated their intention of remaining in that hospitable domicile for some time to conwe. At length to bed they went, but how they slept deponent knoweth not. In the morning they reappeared, and ui due time a sumptuous breakfast was prepared, to which the happy couple sat down; but, as, it is said, the courso of true love seldom runs smooth, so in this instance, for scarcely had the revelry begun, when, lo ! in popped the wonuan's husband, accompanied by.a policeman. Now, under such circtm. sta,uces it is natural enough to expect that all the orockery on the table and the heads of the wife and her paraumour ,would be smashed to atoms, or at least seriously injured: but no, the tender-hearted, fondly-loving husband merely said, vith the utmost sasiyfroid, " My dear, Ize come to tak tbee hooam; will thon gang"" To which his cara epos(f as coolly replied, "No, never." Yet all was peace and quietness; the loving couple continued doing ample justice to their luxurious repast, while the husband sat looking on and smoking his pipe. After breakfast some conversat;on followed, in which the unhappy husband used all the eloquence of which he was capable to induce hif faithless spouse to return to his home, at Sutton, near Hull, promising, if she would return, lie would froelv forgive her and never again mention her misconduct. She, however, seemed resolved to abide by her choice, and all entreaties, pronises, and arguments appeared but a waste of words. At length threats were resorted to, and, Feeing the strong arm of the law before her, madame most reluctantly consented to go back, but declared most positively and determinately that she would never live 'with him again; and before packing up for departure she told her paramour to meet her in Hull, and, cn parting, they enmbraced each othor most lovingly in the presence of the husband ! Many other sayings and doings connected with this serio-comic affair might have been given, some of which were very amusing and some of a contrary character.

AmERICA?1 STEAMLSHIP.-The Vanderbilt has disappiointed those who expected her to make one of the crack ocean passages, and the Niagara has succeeded in crossing the ooean in something over 18 days, during 14 of which she was under sail and steam. We understand that the astoaishing volobity of the Niagara is explained by Captain lladson's very proper dread of losing his spars; we have no doubt that the Vanderbilt would have made as quick a trip as herfriends predicted had not herengineer been afraid of overbeating her boilers or c6afing her wheels. It is all right as it is; and people 'who want to grumble will be so good as to hold their peace.. We hope, however, we may inquire what becomes of the Collins steamer Blank, commanded by Captain Blank, which leaves on Wednesdays, at blatk intervals, from the foot of Canal-street, and on board of wbich passengers are earnestly requested to have their luggage by an early hour in the moraing. Is there any such tteamer? Does she really leave ? Or would the passenger who sent hbi luggage down in compliance with the advertisement find himself even blanker than the gallant ship and her noble commander, Captain - It really lookLs as though the control of the oce. n was departing from lls, and being securely vested in foreign s,atiois. England is crowding the Atlantic with steamners of all sizes and models, from the Great Eastern downward. }?er screws bid fair, at no distant period, to monopolize the traflic of the ocean, and, of course, in like manner to sweep it in case of war. France enters the lists with three Transatlantic lines, to which the State grants 14,000,000 francs subvention, nearly $1,000,000 per annum per line. Even Sardinia, Spain, and Holland are on the track. We alone seem to be stationary. The policy of those Western and Sontli-Western mem)bers of ('Ci'grees who haveobtained from the United States millions of acres of land for t-he development of their couitry by meanis of railroads has always been to discountenance appropriations for ocean Bteamships, on the ground that they were monopolies-in their nature opposed to the public interest. By this dog-in-the.-nanger system, wh ile they helped themselves to all they wanted, they ruined the prospects of our steam marine. 'i'bey induced the Post-oifice and Congress to refuse appropriations in aRid of steamers, and the consequence is thse decay wUhich we see.

VTHE BBNGAL MUTINIES. (FROM OUVR CALCUTTA CORRESPONDET.) The news of the recent mutinies 'in the Bengal army has been received in England with a feeling of perhaps unnecessary alarm. The telegraph alwaya condenses history into epigrams, and the event which, accompanied by details, would seem natural or unimportant, becomes in its necessary brevity and nakedness almost portentous. The popular instinct as usual is as correct as the popular information is imperfect. We do in India perform the feat Prince Schwarzenburg once pronounced impossible. We do sit on bayonets. The obedience of the Sepoys, right or vwrong, is therefore our necessity. The slightest refusal of that obedience is our greatest danger, but the degree and the imminence of the hazard are both somewhat exaggerated. The Sepoy army is not in revolt; it does not even appear that it is dicoontented. All that is yet clear, in the judgment of those most familiar with Indian affairs, is that the Hindoo portion of a few regimetits in the " regalar" section of one of the three Indian armie3 has been irritated on a caste question. Theirirritation has produced in two instances a refusal to obey an order involving the very breach of caste of which the Hindoos are apprehensive. That refusal is, of course, mutiny. It must of course be punished, and sternly. But it does not involve that general discontent or that systematic resistance of which a few worthy but timid people appear to be afraid. It is, however, dangerous enough to demand investigation, and before we commence an analysis of its causes it may be as well to strip the question of some needless accessories. The mutiny is not instigated by any religious feeling. Every mutiny that has ever occurred in India has been apparently created by one of two causes-a reduction of pay or an outrage on caste prejudice. The reason for that fact is simple enough. lNo other Cause would ever induce three Sepoys to act together. They have no patriotism, for during 600 years they have had no country. They have no sense of a common interest in the common weal, for the same instinct of segregation which makes caste possible renders Rum indifferent to the oppression suffered by Gopal. They have no " grievances " after the European acceptation of that word. The Sepoy's pay is excessive, as high as a poand a-week would be t, the English soldier. His work is so little that ennuti is the curse of an Indian regiment. His discipline is even too lax; his relative position to Europeans, which strikes some Englishmen as invidious, strikes him as an arrangement as little open to question as a law of nature; he would as soon think of murmuring at it as of murmuring at the cholera. No agitator, tberefore, has a chance unless he can excite alarm for the Sepoy's pay or the Sepoy's caste; and therefore it is that every mutiny resolves itself into one of these two questions. Last time the quarrel was about pay; it is now about caste. A regiment raised from a bad class-the men of the ol0l Bundelcund legion-grows in cantonments sulky and restless. Its officers are by accident a little below the average; its native officers are men, some of them at least, of that credulous, brooding temperament, at once childlike and ferocious, which seems peculiar to Asiatics. Suddenly one of them is taunted with loss of caste. He is told by a Bengalee lascar-an animal in Sepoy estimation of about the social status of a hog-that he (the Sepoy) is an outcast, that he has eaten pig's flesh. He inquires, finds the story correct, hears that his cartridge is really smeared with pig's fat, and jumps instantly to the conclusion,-Government bought the fat, Government is all-wise and all-powerful, and of course bought pigs' fat deliberately. In three hours every Hindoo in the regiment is frantic with excitement. On the purity of his caste depends, not his religion, for a pure-caste man may believe anythn he likes, but his social status, the respect of his friends, the attachment of his family, all that sweetens life to the Asiatic as well as ou:selves. The next impulse, of course, is to avert the dreaded calamity. No Asiatic ever dreams of argument or "constitutional remonstrance" with an oppressor. He looks to force only as his safety, and the Sepoy, of course, resolves to resist the order. But there is this peculiarity in his reasoning-he never believes that resistance can be succeasful. So deeply rooted is the habit of submission, the belief in the omnipotence of authority, that his impulse is not to resist so much as to fly, and, as a necessary preliminary to flight, to be rid of his officers. It is despair, not courage, which prompts these murderous resolutions. It is despair, not a plan of rebellion, which urges the men to write groaning letters to other regiments petitioning for help. IG is despair, not license, which induces them to frame wild projects of plunder. The process of reasoning we have hinted at is not imaginary. The 3tth in their wildest moments never dreamt of upsetting the Government. Their advice to the 19th was to murder their officers and fly into the jungle. Flight is not the resource of successful conspirators with a plan. Their plan on the night of the garden fite was to seize the bullion in the Mint, and-fight ? No; but to disperse to their homes. There was no idea of organization, no plan, no leader, no purpose, except to do anything and go anywhere to get out of the reach of an inexpiable insult. It wiU be seen at once that I reject the idea that the Sepoys are alarmed for their religion. If they were, if they were realy under the impression that they were the victims of a "proselyting" Government, the Mussulman would be the first to move. A Mussulman wiU die for his creed, while a Hindoo chatters about it. We saw at Awadh how fierce wvas the zeal of the Pathans, who died sboulder to shoulder in their attack on Barlow's Hindoo gunners. Those men came of no special tribe. They were the fathers, brothers, and uncles of our own Mussulman Sepoys, who in Barrackpore at least, stand aloof from the whole movement. Lord Ellenborough says the Sepoys are offended by the Governor-Generalrs missionary subscriptions'? Does his Lordship imagine that the Sepoys read missionary reports, or that Mussulmans are specially favourable to missionary effbrt? Others, better informed, attribute the irritation to the rapid progress of Christian ideas and measures. Doubtless the Sepoys, like all other Hindoos, feel a bitter conviction that Christianity is winning the day; but it is strange, if this be the cause of mutiny, that the irregulars, who are equally endangered, axd from the status of the men rather more eensitive, should quiz the alarm of the line. But if caste, a social and not a religious question, be really at issue, how happens it that twvo regiments at Barrackpore remain perfectly obedienit ? The reply is the key to the whole movement and to the nature of our true danger,-they trusted their officers. So long as there is one officer in a regiment to whom the men can talk and in whom they place con6dence there will be no mutinies. That regiments by the dozen shouid be left without one officer in that position is the reason why the ablest officers in India believe that the organization of the line has become effete. For the past 20 years the course of events lhas compelled the Government of India to deprive the Bengal army of its most energetic and niost able officers. Every ten years has added a new kingdom. Every new kingdom has, and must have, an ndnminsi3trative service. That service must be cheap anld exllcent. it must alsobe comipo-se-d-o-f-m-e-n-rveady made, of men who at least understand the native language and native character. Such men can be found only in the army, and every man who can talk readily inthe vernacular, who has an appetite for native traditions, who has a tendency to rate natives at their fair value, who is, in short, competent to govern, is drawn away for civil employ. The brain of the regiment thus abstracted, it zemains to steal its muscles. The youngster who can ride, hunt, swiim, wrestle, and fight, the boywho pursues tigers on foot, the man who can quell a row by a rough jest,-the very men to attract and govern the childlike Sepoy-are " appointed to the irregu- lars." What is left to the line regiment ? We wiU not say "the refuse," but at all events half a-dozen thoroughly disheartened men. They have lost their chance. Promotion comes slowly and without work. At40 Sepoy-talk becomes tiresome. There is the billiard table. "Jack" is voted a bore, and tne officer either sinks into the useless, self-in. dulgent "Qui bye," or more frequently disencumbers himself of Orientalim altogether, and lives on a grumbling Englishman in a foreign land. There are better specimens, of course, else had the system already broken down; but with the multiplication of new departments and the opening up of new careers they are becoming few. Moreover, as if it were not enough to draw off the best soldiers from these regiments, the Government is compelled, . just when they bave become unfit for active life, to send them back to regimental commands. A colonel who ias been teaowhig the " black classics" for 30 years commands one regiment. An officer who cannot ride, and never saw even a review, is placed at the head of another, Half the regiments in Bengal are commanded by men whose lives have been spent, and well spent, in the bureau. Nor is this aL As if to destroy the last relic of espr-it de corps, or soldierlike pride, the regiments are turned into penal settlements. Any unlucky staff officer who commits a fault, or iho is too stupid, or too slow, or too careless, or too ignorant for stafl' wrork is " remanded " to his regiment. Theother day a native revenue officer in Pegu bolted. His superior, a very able collector,was immediately remanded to his regiment, and all India murmured at the severity of the sentence. Imagine the Guards turned into a penal settlement for Commissioners of Excise. What wonder that a regiment commanded by an old taxgatherer, aided by a couple of discontented captains, and five or six boys hungering for civil employ, should lose confidence in its officers ? As we said before, it is loss of confidence that constitutes the present danger. The Sepoy has always believed lies. He was jUst as credulous in the time of Clive; b, t he has unti nowalwayshad confidenceinhis immediate superiors, has always been able to gain access easily to men whom he knew would not deceive him. The evil is admitted throughout India, and the minds of the most experienced officers are nearly made up as to the remedy. Two plans have hitherto found advocates, but the first is now slowly declining in public favour. It is simplv to increase the number of officera. It is felt that though the easiest plan it would prove rather a palliative than a remedy, and leave untouched some incidental evils nearly as important as the decline in the trust reposed by the Sepoy in his officers. The strongest wish of an able officer would still be to cease to be a soldier. The remainder would still be left disheartened.The excessive age of all general officers would be still further increased. A General of 55 is even now a phenomenon in a country won by Generals under 30. vlnder the proposed addition the ordinary age would probably be 65, for the officer unable to obtain staff allowances must, for his childrens' sake, stay on as long as he dares. The system of promoting antiquated privates to commissions-now given up by its oldest advocates-would remain untouched. Above all, there could, were a mere addition made to the regimental strength, be no principle of selection. The "faculty for managing natives," that sixth sense which can neither be communicated nor learnt, -which often makes a man almost without brains the most useful servant in the est.blishment or a regiment, would still be valueless. The regiments would still be intrusted to men whose only claim to command is the constitution, or the selfish precaution, which has enabled them to resist the climate. All the reforms I have hinted at rather than detailed are secured by the second plan at once and for ever. It is briefly this,-to increase the force of Company's Europeans, by, say, 20 regiments, to double or triple the necessary proportion of officers, and to use them as dep6ts, whence to obtain the picked mennecessary tocommandirregulars. Recruiting for the line should stop, and as the numbers decrease their place should be supplied by new irregular regiments, organized on the plan found so successfuil in Scinde, in Oude, and in the Punjab. The Bengal army would then consist of an enormously strengthened force of Europeans, aud of an army of irregulars commanded by picked men, and from the suitability of their discipline to Asiatic habits more efficient than the antiquated line. There -would, in such an arrangement, be no increase of expense;an important point with an army which costs nearly half the net revenue. The fighting officers would be young men and picked men. The native officers would be usually gentlemen, always selected-as they are now in this arm-for activity and zeaL The irregular officers, with only their regiments to look to, and from their small numbers forced to work, would secure once more, as they did in the old days, the confidence of the Sepoys. We might possibly find native officers in our ranks of almost dangerous ability, but at least the empire would be in no peril from regiments commanded by strangers, or mutinies on account of a rumour about caste.
FIIZE AT MESSRS. PICKFORD AND CO.'s. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-The exaggerated statements which have appeared in reference to the results of the late fire at the prenises occupied by Messrs. Picldord and Co. at Camden-town induce me to request the favour of your giving insertion to this note in your next issne. It is, of course, imposaible for me to ascertain exactly the loss which has been sustained; but sufficient is already klnown to enable me to deny the accuracy of many of the statements. For instance, it is said that 40,000 quarters of corn were destroyed. The entire quantity in the building was 400 quarters, with 1,200 quarters of beans. The number of horses is greatly overstated, and I am happy to add that only one animal met with any casualty. The area of the warehouses destroyed is little more than an acre, instead of five as stated. The quautity of goodswithin the warehouses at the time of the conflagration was very small, owing to the fact that all the important trains for the north had been despatched, and time was given by telegraph to stop the incoming trains. The entire weight of goods (many of them of very small value) which was destroyed is about CO tons, and the insurances effected upon them will cover the loss. T'he building itself was insured for a con siderable amount and the loss on it will be smalL. I need hardly say that, as the warehouse is separated from the railwa by the Regent's Canal, neither the line nor other works o' the railway were affected. Tho various reports which hava appeared in the public prints all seem to assess the damage at exactly 250,0001.; without being able precisely to state the amount, I have little hesitation in sayiug that in aU probability this sum is about four times the real amount, including the building. I may add that the business has not been iaterrupted. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, MIARK T-UTTT. meneral Manager's-office, Euston Station, Jane 13. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

PREACHING .AT EXErTER-HArL-.!he doors of this vast building were again opened at 6 o'clock yesterday evening to admit those who wished to take part in the fourth of the series of special services which are being celebrated there, with the sanction of the Archbishop of Can. terbury, on Sunday evenings by bishops and clergymen of the church of England, in order that thereby the sound of the Gospel may be brought witbin hearing of Ihe working classes. LoDg before 6 o'clock several hundreds of well-dressed people of both sexes maniifested their eagerness to be present by crowding round the doors. A sprinkling of men belonging to the working class was scarcely visible among them; the great majority were evidently of a rank in . e higher than that for ahich these special services were intended. It would seem that the novelty of a church of England service in such a building had allured almost the whole of the crowd from their own parish churches. Efforts weremadewitbgreateurnestness, but with sliglitsuccess. byau agentof the committeeunder whose auspices the serviceshave been undertaken to persuade such of the most miserably clad people who happened to be passing along the Strand to enter the hall when the doors were opened. Within about half-an-hour after the opening of the doors the whole of the 4,000 seats in the hail became occupied, and several persons were obliged to be content with were standing roou. On taking a survey of the dense mass of worshippers we found that the R1ev. Mr. Molyneux migbt, had he been present, have very justly repeated the cowplaint which he made on the previous Sunday evening-namely, that the hal vwas filled by too large a proportion of those who were higher in the social scale than those who were expected to be there. Precisely at half-past 6 o'clock the Rev. Dr. Miller, canon of Worcester, entered the hall, attired in his clerical robes, and accompanied by the EaBl of Harrowby, the Eirl of Shaftesbury, and several other members of the committee. From the temporary pulpit in the front of the platform the rev. gentleman gave out the first hymn from the selection of hymns for these services, and after that had been sung by the congregation, accompanied by the great organ, the rev. gentleo an read a portion of the Bible; thenfollowed the Litany and arother hymn, after whichhe delivered in earnest tones a sermon on the impossibility of salvation without the regeneration of the heart by the grace of God, his text being from the 3d of St. John, 9th verse:"And NXicodemus answered how can these things be?" The discourse was llstened to with the most lprofound attention by the immense congregation. Tho series of services extends to the eight succeeding Sunday evenings.

THE &AP2UFACTURE OF SMALL ARMS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIE3. Sir,-In The Times of the 5th inst. there appeared a letter from MIr. Goodman, the Chairman to the Setters-up of the Birmingham Gun Trade. If the letter had not been signed, it would have been suppo-ed to have emanated from a person bat little acquainted with the facts of the case as therein represented, and no one would have cared to answer the writer; coming, however, as it does, with the writer's signature affixed, it is necessary to make a short statement of the real facts for the information of the public generally. Firstly, with reference to the assertionthat thepattionof theEnfieldriflewasoriginally theproductionof a Birmingham gunmaker,-.f beg to give this state. ment an unqualified denial. The arm in question was proposed by a committee of officers in 1852-3, and was acepted as the result of that committee. Several gunmakers were invited to send models of arms to the committee for trial, but none were I ound to possess an the different points which were laid down as essential for a military rifle. All the good points of the various arms submitted for trial were carefuly considered by the committee, vho finally proposed A pattern which has every right to be considered as emanating solely from the committee then sitting at Enfield, and has in consequence been called the "Enfieldrifle." Secondly,the next point, and one which Mr. Goodman pretends to consider a grievance, is, that the Government bave not presented the arm now being made at Enfield to the trade at Birmingham as the model from which the Government desire to be furnished with a supply of arms by the trade. INow, the fact is, that the Government deserve every praise for their forbearance in not insisting upon their suiperior model of arm beirg made to govern the supply from the trade. The public should be made acquainted with the following facts:-The Royal Small Arms Factory was erected, andisbeing most successfully conducted, on a prmciple totally different to any yet attempted in England. The question at issue is not merely the making of a rifle, but that the rifle sO made should resemble any and every other made in the establishmen-t so completely that all similar parts should be capable of interchanging. If a soldier should lose his bayonet or ramrod (two parts which, from being detached or loose, might very easily be dropped) he may get similar articles to replace them at once without any special fitting being required. All the partsof the arm are made on this principle, and it can easily be conceived how valuable such a principle must be in an army which has to be armed entirely with one pattern of arm. Instead of an armourer having to forge, file, and specially fit any limb to a lock, the fiiished parts wiU be supplied to regiments, and will replace in a moment those which have been injured. This system is one which can only be pursued and successfully carried out by a proper condition of manufacture, where all is conducted under the supervision of one head, who watches the progress of every part from the forged to the finished state. Would the Government have done either wisely or well in demanding from the gunmakers of Birn.ingham that they should accept the Government ai m, and manufacture on a similar principle ? The!arms manufacturers of Birmingham are utterly incapable of carrying out any system of this sort upon their present mode of manufacture; and the Government have consequently exercised only a just forbearance towards them in not insisting upon their acceptance of the Enfield-made arm as a nmodel for them to follow. But the real facts of the case are that however for mere political motives it may furnish a good peg to hang a quarrel upon, and so attack the Government, the small arms imanfacturers of this country -1 ;peak of those who are enlightened and liberal men, and of such there is no lack-view with interest rather than otherwise the Government establishment as assisting them to control their men and regulate prices. Almost every g,inmaker connected with the military gun trade has been to Enfield to see what he could borrow in the shape of ideas for executing his work better and more cheaply than is at present done; and not only the masters but also the skiled workmen of the trade have been sent in large numbers to see the factory, for the purpose of being convinced that another system than that hitherto so blindly folowed can produce arms under conditions of quality and interchange of parts unapproachable by the trade. The London Armoury Company has been established to follow in the course pointed out by the Government, and to this company the Government have granted permission to borrow from the factory every means which can assist them in successfuily competing with the Government factory. All the parts of arms, in every stage of manufacture, have been forwarded to the company to help them in their endeavours to turn out similar arms to those made at Enfield. Even Birmingham is taking hints from Enfield, and copies of letters received from Mr. Goodman himself are enclosed, in which he applies for assistance and information. Mr. (*oodman has on the part of the Birmingham contractors thrown out a chalenge to the Government which it is quite possible that they may accept; but I wil only caution the authorities, who have still to depend for the supply of every pattern of arm (except the Enfield rifle) upon the arms manufacturers of this country, that not a single arm would be made by the trade-in fact, there would be an immediate suspension of work on the part of the men-if the principle of interchange were insisted upon, or even the same quality of work throughout the entire arm. In proof of this it may be here stated as a fact, that when it was desired lately to introduce the principle of interchange, as far as the sword bayonets and ramrods were concerned, in the new pattern short rifes for rife corps, the Government officers had to yield the point, even before the work had been put into the men's hands, solely on account of a representation made to the Small Arms Department that the difficulties in the way of execating the work on that principle amounted to an impossibility. Wllhy do not the Birmingham trade follow the example set by the London Armoury Company, and enrol themselves as a company, purchase n,achinery, and really by legitimate meaus try to beat the Government out of the field? This is open to them, and would be much more to theircreditthan engaging in a kind of desultory warfare, and maldng statements which are easily refuted. 1 am, Sir, your most obedient servant. IV.

-EXETER-HALL SBRBVCES. TO THE EDITOR OF TEHE TIIES. Sir,-It bas been stated that the services at Eseter-hall are attended mainly by other persons than those for whom they were designed. I believe that the reverse is the truth. It is difficult to determine by a glance those of the congregation who belong to the working classes. The London artisan expends a fair sum on his dress, and on Sundays is not easily distinguishable from persons of a far wealthier condition. Last Sunday evening one of the appointed agents went to the common lodging-houses in his district for his usual ministrations; he found the houses empty, the inmates being gone to the service at Exeter-hall.

CAFFrItAA AND THE CAPSE oF GooD HorE.-Copies nd extracte of correspondence between the Secretary of the Colonies and the Governor of the Cape Colony on the application of the annual grant of 40,0vC. for promoting the civilization of native tribes has just been pubblahed by order of Parliament. The last grant was made by Parliament in July, 1866. Governor G:rey, in acknowledging the despatch of Dr. Secretary Labouchere (in January, 1857), stated that the revenue from Caffraria for the ensuing year would have been large enough to enable him to dispense wFith sorue portion of the annual grant had not the murrain of cattle and tho wholesale destruotion of live stock and food, under the injunctions of " the propheta" annihilated that portioa of the revenue derivable from fines of cattle, Great progress, however, ha been made in preparing the way for the future deve. lopment of the resources of the country. The natives have been practised in the use of the ruder European imple. ments used in their cultivation, and been habituated to regular work. They have opened up their country by roads, and have been instructed by our Government both ia things pixitual and temporal. The result hitherto has been en. tirely to win the affections of the Fingoe population to the English. Thus a war has been warded off, partly by thue rneasures of conciliation and partly by the presence of a strong force oa the frontier (which is alleged to be indis pensable at present), and everything augurs well for the MmgrQ under the wisÂ§ a iaidtativ of rGoveorQ GNey.

In consequence of tho state of the money. market very little has been done towards the construction of he remalningportion of the line,16mile3 inlengah,fromSleaord to Boston, but it is expected that the Boston people and others will assist in carryng out the undertaking to the latter place The event was ceebrated by entertainments given to the workng people, as vrell as by a grand dinner given by the directors and Mlessrs Smith and Knight, the contractors,toabout380guest, at wbich Mr. H. Ingram, L?P., the chairman of the company, presided. Loyal and other toasts were given and responded to by Mr. Ingrain, ILP., Mr. Wilson, M.P., Colonel French, 11.P., Mr. W. S. Lindcly, 3LP., Mr. G. HE Packe, Mr. S. Clarke. Mr. J. Parry, Tr. G. Knight, the Rev. E. Trollope, Mr. G. PW Stephenson, C.E., Mr. B. Watldn, M.P., Dr. Mackay, Mr. Crnningham, Mr. M Lemon, and other gentlemen. It appeared that the inhabitants of the district were much mdebted to the able exertions of Mr. Ingram and Mr. Parry for the completion of the first section of the line, and that the Great Northern Railway Company had afforded every facility to the directors for working the railway. The line opens to-day for public traffic. REPORTS OF COMITMEES ON RALWAY BILS. 8nimopsamRE U2N'loN, LoNDoN AND NORTH-WESTE1X, AND SIROPSuTIT CANAL. Mr. ADAM reported from the Committee on Group 9 of Railway Bills that the principal objects of the Bill were the confirmation of an existing agreement for the sale to the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company of the Shropshire Canal, and the vesting of that undertaking in the London and North.Western Company, as lessees under the authority ot Parliament of the undertaking of the Shropshire Union Railwa3s and Canal Company; the construction of a line of railway occnpyiog in its course portions of the site of the Shropshire Canal, and the diEcontinuance for public navigation of pRrts of that canal; the a^quisition by the London and North-Western Railway Company of additional land at Watford; power for the London and North-Western and Great Western Railway Companies to enter into agreements with respect to the acquisition oruser by the former oompany of lands at Shrewsbury belonging to the latter company; further provision as to the station at Chester, ns which the Loodon and North-Western, the Great Western, and certain other companies are jointly interested.

Errington and Mr. Beech were the engineers examined in support of the Bill, and the committee were satisfied of the fitness in an engineering point of viow of the proposed raUiway. Satisfactory evdence had been adduced before the comrsittee that the Shropshire Canal cannot be worked advantageously as a canal in conseuence of the peculiarity of its corstraction and the difficlty of keeping it supplied with wvater; the committee are of opinion that it is for the public benefit that it should be vested in the London and North-Western Railway Company and be converted into a railway, and that the restriction imposed by the 133d standing order ought not in the present case to be enforced.

OATHS BraL.-We have always considered Roman Cathoieo Liberalism to he one of the hollowest deluFions of the present age. Wherever the powers that be are opposed to their pretensions, there the Roman Catholics are noisy reformers ard demagogues. But wherever the Government is a dutiful subject of the Vatican, who so ze%lous on the side of order as the Popish priesthood? There is, however, this wide difference between their conduct under each contingency. Democracy they hate from their hearts, and only use as a tool; despotism they love with congenial warmth, and use as a trusted confederate. From one point o view we cannot blame them. High tbeories of civil government are naturally allied to bigh theories of ecclesiastical government. We Might object tA either or to hoth; but as long as the allianoe was opeolv acknowledged and vindicated on broad principles tbe Romanists would be entitled to as much forbearance and charity as any other honest antagonist. Bnt it is the attempt to persuade the people of this country that Roman. ism is something essentially different from what it is-something which sympathizes with freedom of thought and action both in religion aud politics, instead of being fundamentally hostUle to both-that has excited in the minds of the British people a sentiment of unconquerable distrust. It has now become almost imposasble to persuade them that when a Romanist speaks on political questions be has really anything at heart but the advancement of his religious tenets, Destructive in one country and obstructive in another; here calling for religious liberty, there burning the Bible aud lashing the heretic; now prating of loyalty, and anon whisMeinn rebeUion, he has created an impression which it wij take nigh a century to efface-that with politics he plays fast and loose, and wiU advocate rolitical theones most opposed to the fundamental principles of hi. creed if he thinks he can thereby shake the resolution of Ministers or entrap the sympathy of mobq. The above remark-s may seem too severe for the occasion, and we hasten to rep,eat that it is the system we are condemning more than individuals. Under the potent influence of a carefuly organized system, directe l by the deepest sagacity, experience, and foresight, individuals lose much of their responsibility, and berome almost unconscious agents. We have no desire to make any personal reflections upon those noblemen and gentlemen who are banded together for the purpose of repealing the securities exacted from their coreligionists in I829. We only say that their lauguage upon the subject of religious liberty does but show the extraordinary extent to which men can impose upon themselves, and the extraordinary confidence which Roomanists entertain in the credulity cf mankind. If the Church of Rome were as consistent as the other bodies of English Dissenters she would be treated with the same consideration; but we cannot allow the great watchwords of civil and religious liberty to be prostituted to the purposes of a church which would throw us off our guard by profeEsions of friendship, and when the ramparts were unmauned rush on the defenceless citadeL This langtuage, we reeat over and over again, is not too strong. Itis justified by experience; it is justified by the conduct of the Roman Church in this country in I8 ; - it is justified by the spectacle of Irish and continental PDperv for many years past; and, more than all, it is jusatified by her recent experiments in Belgi,D. It is the boast of Rome that she never changes ; and if she speaks fair to LiberAlism we may be certain it is with th intention of betraying it. Granted that the oath imposed in 1829 leaves many Roman Catholics perfecotly free in conscience to vote asthey choose, it does not leave al, and even that is something gained. But what iS more to the purpose is this, th a great principle is thereby affirmed; that the dangerous difference between Romanism and every other form of dissent is constantly kept before us; and that this undoubtedly does exercise A oertain moral influence over the whole of the community. This is the advantage of the existing state of things, and w do not see what counterbalancing boon would really bo gcoferred on the Romanists by the removal of it. If they wish to remlain good subjects of Queen Victoria, and to abvtain from inter. ference with the Churc'h of England, wrher. is the bardship?9 IE they don%$ where is the polie of granting their xtquesb 9-27e Pres.
