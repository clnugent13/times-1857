AfONEY-MABKETandCITY ITTLLaRGBXO Thursday venIng. This has been another favourable day and if the news from America by the Ariel, whici is stllU delaved, should not prove very discouraging therex will be ground to hope that an inerease of pressure may be avoided. There has been no announcement of any further failures of magnitude either in Iondon or the provinces; shipments of bar gold to the continent are still suspended, and several orderi for the despatch of silver to India have been counter. imanded. The pressure for discount at the Bank continues heavy, but it has greatly moderated in camparison with the early days of the week, and the large repayments of advances falling due have been well met. About 100,000 sovereigns are said to have been withdrawn for transmission to New York by the Peraia on Saturday; but the total to be despatcbed vill depend on any intelligence that ma be received to-morrow. Consols for money, whicl left off yesterday at 87-, were first quoted 88 to J. They then receded to o7i, whence on the breaking up of the Bank Court without the announcement of any alteration in the terms of discount, there wait. again a recovery to 884, the market being supporte& by numerous purchases on the part of the publlc, It was still sensitive, however, and the circulation of a varety of unfounded rumours caused a declineto 87j to J, which was the last official price. Forthe lUth of November they closed at 88t to J. After regular hours there was an advance of an eighth. In connexion with the settlement of the account. which has just taken place four failures were declared, but the transactions were not of a very heavy character. Bank Stock left off at 211 to, 213; Reduced, 861 to 87; New Three per Cents., 86i to 87; India Stock, 207 to 209; India Bonds, 30s. to 20s.; and Exchequer-bills (of which 10,0001. were again purchased on public account), lOs. to 6s. discount. In the Stock-Exchange loans on Government securities were in demand at 6i percent. In the foreign stock-market there has beem greater activity, but prices show no material alteration. Turkish continues firm at the late recovery. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1829 and 1839, wrenegotiated at 98 ; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Mexican, 194 and i, for the account 19a and J Peruvian Four-and-h-Half per Cents., for the acco-unt, 54; Portuguese, 43i; Rubsian Five per Cents., 105i; ditto, Four-and-a-Hall per Cents. 95k; Spanish, j4O, for the account 40k; ditto, Newr Deferred, for the account, 25i and i; ditto, Paasive, 5i and 6; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 87k, 88, and 87 ; ditto, Four per Cents.. Guaranteed, 97 ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 63i J, and J; ditto, Four per Cent. Certificates,. 95; and Peruvian Four-and-a Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 54. The final quotations of the French Three perCents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were66f. 75c. for money, and 66f. 80c. for the end of themonth, showing a decline of J per cent. The rate of discount at Hamburg to-day has advanced to 9 per cent. The transactions of Hamburg with New York are larger than those of any other continental city, and the American crids Is. severely felt there. The letters from Lisbon state that a financial crisis had manifested itself in Portugal. From Belgium it is mentioned that the rate of discount, which was lately raised from 3J to 4i per cent., inexpected shortly to be further advanced. The Swedish Government have advertised the particulars of a proposed loan of about 1,200,0001., to be expended in the further extension of the railway system in Sweden and Norway; but the Journal de Frankfort states that, according, t Hamburg advices, the contract has already been adjudicated to Messrs. Merk and Co. and the Bank of Northern Germany. It is added that the terms are not so favourable as had been anticipated in Sweden. Subjoined are some interesting suggestions on Indian finance. The writer entirely recognizes the. insuoerable objections to the raising of any loan for India in this country; but owing to the damage inflicted on the credit of the local Govermnent by their culpable conduct two or three years back, when they induced the holders of stock to submit to a reduction to 4 per cent. on the representation of a flourishing revenue, and almost immediately afterwards announced a new 5 per cent. loaD, he doubts if any offer on their part would now prove successful. On this point, however, his views are probably extreme. Although the conduct to which he refers deserved and received at the time the strongest condemnation, it i- not likely to have the permanent effect which those who are still smarting from the recollection of it are disposed to expect. The native capitalists must be well aware that it will never be repeated, and, indeed, the recent arrangement for receiving at par,. under certain circuwmtances, the stock that was thus depreciated, is a public acknowledgment and apology for the inuastice committed. Still the matter is doubtful, and, under the assumption that his apprehensions are correct, he recommends that while any loan that may be required should be raised in India it should be invited under the guarantee of the Imperial Government. There are many objections to such a course, but it would obviously be far better than that of raising the money here. It would be highly inijudicious to hold out a precedent to all our possessions that riot and rapine would merely result in the wealth of the territory being increased by the lavish introduction of British wealth; yet there is such peril that our Cabinet, acted upon by those dealers in the London market who are always eager for the raising of loans on any pretext, may jtump at the easy way of meeting all difficulties by a creation of Consols, that any proposal calculated even to modify that prospect is worth entertaining. Because the British Government can raise money at 3' or 3j per cent., whi'e in India probably double that rate would scarcely suffice, the cry is at once set up for supplying the wants of the moment upon those which appear to be the readiest terms. But Parliament will have to conPider that the subject has other bearings than just ;he question as to the actual rate of interest to be paid on the sum to be obtained. A loan of ten millions for India-the greater part to be sent out in silver, if silver coluld be procured on any conditions, and, if not, in gold-Implies, perhaps, anr adverse movement of two or three per cent. in our current rates of discount. Upon our aggregate trade of 240,000,0001. per annum, based upon the circulation of commercial bills, the effect thus to ba produced should be well weighed. The diminished power of our manufacturers to compete with other countries undersuch circumstances, aud the influence of timesof pressure in curtailng the national revenue, are likewise to be talken into account. WVhether all these drawbacks will appear slight in comparison with the momentary ease of sending to half-a-dozenLondon capitalists and getting what is required is a matter for the Legislature to determine. It is enouagh if those who have the duty meanwhile to watch the public welfare take care that they are not overlooked. It must be remarked, moreover, that evei if these points were not before us we should still have to recognize the singular fact involved in our raising loans for India, that we should be creating an absolute inducement for throwing off our rule. If the safety of the stock created is made to depend on the faithfulness of the population we have a surety that every native holder will be an^xious to- support us. If, on the contrary, the dividends are guaranteed, happen what may, then among any other fancied indiucements to insurrection would be the advantage of getting rid of the liability of providing for them. The concluding remarks in the annexed letter regarding the expediency of allowing the Zemindars in Bengal to purchase exemption from the land tax deserve great attention, since by this means apparently an enormous available fund might be raised for future improvements, while hoards of specie woiild be drawn out:- " Sir,-When the East India Company by their misrepresentations induced their fundholders to transfer their in. terest in the 5 to a 4 per cent. loan they were warned that the time wouid come that they would be unable to raise another loan because of the destraction of all confidence in their financial integrity, and that time has now arrived. " The inability of the Company now to negotiate a loan does not arise from political ovents, for if the population of IndiA bad intended to join the mutineers they would have done so on the 31st of August, the anniversary of the great Mahemedan festival, and as that day has passed it is now the opinion of all wbo are conversant with Indian affai a that tbe suppression of the mutiny will be as prompt as its outbreak was sudden, and that British supremacy will henc forth be more certain than ever. "The uninitiated do not know the real financial condition of the Company, nor can it be ascertained froma their published reporta, because no confidence can be placed in those documents after our experience with reference to the loan transaotions of the last three years. P'I cannot believe, however, that it is so desperate as generally supposed. The Government receipts from thfe rresidencies of Madras and Bombay, from Lower Beags%, and from the opium districts cannot have been affected by the recent revolt, The pecuniary misbhief iX.dl J

BAMILWAYANDAMJNING *HARB& Thuxy Evening. In the railway-market a general advance bas taken place, lerwick and York and North Midland eing {specially in good demand. The public appear to have taken the advantage of the late depreciation in shares to make purchases for investmnint. Great Western and Caledonian exceptionally receded. There was a further improvement in East lndian and Canadian descriptions; Geelong and Melbourne and Ceylon were higher, and a reduction occurred in Buffalo and Lake Huron. At the commencement of business French shares advanced, but on the receipt of lower prices from Paris a relapse took place, and the market closed with a downward tendency.

FOREIGN INTBLLIGENCB. FRANCE. (FROX 003 OWN CORRESPONDENT.) fMne following appeared in our second edilton of yes' berdav !-.1 PARIS, OCr. 14, 6 p.M. The mark of favour shown by the Emperor Napoleon to Prince JoachiaI Murat-a very young man, although said to be sensible beyond his years, and a mere lieutenant In the army-by sending him to Berlin with a letter to the King of Prussia, could not fail to attract observation and give rise to rumours. One of these, which I did not consider worth mentioning at the time, was that Prince Joachima would be the French candidate for the throne of Moldo-Wallachia. Other names have also at different times been put forward as likely to have the support of this Government, if it should be finaUy decided to place a foreign Prince over the Danubian Provinces. These reports may all be considered as idle and as set at rest by the fact that, should a foreigner be needed to rule over the country in question, the French Government will be an advocate for the choice being left to the Moldo-Wallachians themselves. In that case, and if my information from the Principalities be correct, it is not probable that a member of the Bonaparte family would be selected. It seems a fixed idea with some persons that the Emperor Napoleon seeks opportunitiesof placing his relations on foreign thrones, but certainly up to this time there has been not the least Indication of a desire on his part thus far to imitate his uncle's system. Up to late last night nothing had been decided at Madrid about the new Ministry. Nobody can understand the conduct of the Queen, or what she is aiming at; and some alarm seems to have been excited by the idea which had got abroad that Bravo Murillo was considered by her to be too liberal in his political views. Amid these unpleasant doubts and misgivings, general satisfaction appears to be felt at the fall of Narvaez and his colleagues, whose period of power, and especially its latter portion, has been marked by every kind of ilegality, jobbery, and oppression. Sanguine persons had entertained some hopes of Narvaez, whose programme was one of reconciliation and moderation, from which he quickly departed; and he committed the fault of surrounding himself with persons whose unpopularity infected him. His Minister of the Interior, AL Candido Nocedal (candid only in name), isprobably the most unpopular man in Spain-a man whose recklessness of public opinion and neglect of common decency have earned him the most odious reputation. It is well known that in Spain no great amount of talent is requlred to lift a man into a high place. Selfconfidence, some aptness for intrigue, an absence of all scruples, and quickness in seizing an opportunity, have been the chief qualifications of nine out of ten of the Ministers who, for more than 20 years, have misgoverned Constitutional Spain. All these requisites Nocedal possessed. lhree or four years ago the notion of his becomin% a Minister would have been scouted as a bad jest. When once he had worked himself into office he commenced the mad gaUop in which a beggar on horseback is proverbially said to indulge. His insolence astonished even those who knew him best. The manner in which he treated Senators and Deputies, men whose age and position at least entitled them to some consideration-leaving their letters and applications for interviews unanswered, and in various ways slighting and offending themraised up for him hosts of enemies. Always despised, he soon made himself detested. There can be no auestion that his presence by the side of Narvaez estranged from the Premier many who would otherwise have supported him, and contributed largely to render impossible that union among the Moderado party which the Duke of Valencia, at the opening of the Codtes of 1857, emIphatically declared to be his most earnest wish. ToNocedal was due the tyrannical law on the press, which has unquestionably been one prominent cause of the fabll of the M;inistry. Moyano, the Minister of Public Works, although less bitterly disliked than Nocedal, brought discredit on the Goverument by his notorious jobs. In short, there was no redeeming feature in the Cabinet, no one member of it to wrhom the Spaish public accorded its confidence or esteem. It lived without honour or credit, and dies regretted by none. To-night's Pacqs says that Baron de Talleyrand, the French Commissioner in the Principalities, em- barked on the 2d inst. at Giurgevo, on board the I first-class gunboat Meurtriere, with his family, for a long excursion on the Danube. From Turkey in Asia they write to the same paper that at the end of September the Governor of Erzeroum, at the request of the foreign Consuls, sent a corps of troops to put down the robbers infesting the country and who have lately committed very numerous crimes. It Is much to be feared that some of our old friends the Bashi-Bazouka have relapsed into their former predatory practices. A long report by M. Faidherbe, Governor of Senegal, of his expedition against the Arabs of the upper country, has just been published. The chief exploit of the expedition was the capture of the town and fortress of Somsom. This fort was surrounded by a wall 300 metres ia circumference, five metres high, and about four feet thick at the base. The wall was made of stones, clay, chopped straw, and wood, and had 18 towers, serving as bastions. Within there was a smaller enclosure, defended by four towers. The place was impregnable to native attacks, mountain howitzers were insufficient to make a breach, and it was necessary to bring up larger artillery. An attack by a native chief in the French service was un. successful, but he continued to blockade the place, pending the arrival of reinforcements. These, consisting of about 500 men, with 40 mules and three howitzers, ascended the river Senegal, and, landing on the 15th of August, commenced their march by getting into a swamp, where they had to wait the arrival of daylight. They then moved on through a most magnificent country, rich in wood and water, and In a luxuriant vegetation, fig and t-amarind trees rising to such a colossal height as would render any one of them a wonder in Europe. The sight of the fort did not inspire the besiegers with great confidence in its capture, but it was resolved to spring a mine and try an assault by the breach thus made. The Aiabs, however, intimidated by the arrival of fresh enemies, evacuated the place in the night. There was some skirmishing, but with slight loss on either side. Somsom was sacked, the towers blown up, and part of the waUlknocked down. After this success, a razzia was resolved upon against a chief who had first induced Al Hadji, the great saint and warrior of that part of Africa, to enter the district and attack the French fort of Medina. The French were nearly 2,000 strong, including some native troops and voluntears. Their march was attended with all the difficulties to be expected in that country and climate. The troops had to cross numerous watercourses and to struggle through dense forests, which sudden cataracts of rain often convert into lakes. At last they came In sight of the village which was the object of their march, and which was protected by two large " tatas" or forts. A stream intervened swollen by recent rains, and foaming as it rushed along its rockv channel. Two or three shells were thrown, and the infantry plunged in a body into the water. The razzia was completely successful and the booty considerable, consisting of jewels, household utensils, 800 women and children, 500 COWs, and a great number of sheep, asses, and other animals. The cattle served to revictuel MIedina, which had been blockaded for three months. The unlucky Arabs fled, perfectly ruined, and the expedition returned to St. Louis, taking with them a great number of sick, but having lost few men by the enemy's fire. It is observable that the French have of late displayed great activity in all their African possessions, and are evidently determined to get rid of troublesome neighbours, aud to give security to their colonies, if not to extend them It would not be surprising if, at no distant period, measures were to be adopted to stimulate settlement in Algeria by the concession of certain advantages to settlers. It might not be difficult to devise some plan of the kind beyond what has been already done in that way. The Emperor seems to take a strong interest in the African possessions of France, and to be anxious to civilize and Frenchify them. To this end it would, doubtless, be desirable to get persons of the better classes to establish themselves there, but to do this, notwithstanding the proximity of Algeria to France, strong inducements must be held out. A survey is now being made of tbe land bordering on the railways proposed to be constructed in Algeria. These larids will In time, no doubt, become very valuable, And it is said that out of them will be carved mai-raL-, to be bestowed on the great dignitaries of tha Empire. I ami asured that thie. menteoco g4 death pasmed onr Captain Doineau has been commuted by the Emperor to perpetual imprisonment in a fortress. The health of M. de Rayneval is so delicate that it is said it will be impossible for him to proceed 10 St. Petersburg before next summer. It has even been supposed that his destination will be changed, and that a military man will be sent as French Ambassador to the Russian Court. The Costitutjnnei contradicts, as follows, an improbable report circulated by some German papers -- * The Presee of Vienua, the TrWet GazeUe, and letters from Berlin, announce that on tho 2d inst. Lord Stratford de Redoliffe and Baron de Prokesh addressed a protest to the Divan ag&inst the elections which have taken place in lMioldavia and Wallchia. We believe ourselves justified in asserting that no despatch has been received in Paris from Constantinoplo confirming this report The fact of the meeting of the Divans, which are deliberating at this moment, sufflicently proves the improbability of the state. ment." Acconnts from Chambery state that there is every appearance of an early winter in Savoy. On the night of the 5th the Alpine hils in Savoy and those in Dauphin6 were covered with snow. The lower mountains in the neighbourhood of Chambery are likewise white. The Emperor will review the following regiments in Paris to-morrow, which are about to change theirquarters:-The 7thRegiment of Infantryof the Line, going to Brest; the 10th Regiment of Infantry, to Strasburg; the 39th, to Lille; and the 50th, to Nantes; the 3d battalion of Chbseurs, whose destination is not known; and the 7th battalion, who are proceeding to Lyons.

CFRoM OUR OWN CORRESPONDRNT.) BERLINT Ocr. 13. The interest attached here to the varying state of the King's health Is too absorbing to admit of any other subject attaining any dimensions in men's minds. This period of the year is, under ordinary circumstances, of no particular interest; the visiting about of Royal or other influential personages has generally ceased by this time, with the return of short days and cool weather, and nevertheless it is too early in the winter season for politics to have as yet resumed their wonted place in the attention of the community. No wonder, then, that the presence of so important an event to tho State of Prussia as the severe illness of the King, actually endangering his life, should exclude all other topics, even lf they were interesting, which they are not. The bulletins that have been published since I closed my letter yesterday afternoon continue to give favourable accounts of the King's recovery; that of yesterday evening was as follows:- " His Majesty the King has several times in the course of the day enjoyed tranquil sleep, though bnt for short periods at ie time. No symptoms of determination of blood to the head have shown themselves since this morning. " Sans Soaci, Oct. 12, 8 o'clock p.m." That which was published this morning is of very similar tenour:- "H Eis Majesy tho Xing has passod the greater part of the night in tranquil sleep, uninterrapted by any inordi - nate excitement (orgasm) of the blood. This morning His Majesty feels himself, in consequence, less feeble. " Sans Seonc Oct. 13, half-past 8 am." As these bulletins have to be signed by three physicians, Sehonlein, Grimm, and Weiss, it is of course necessary that the wording of them should exclude any point on which they may differ from each other in opinion; and of medical buletins in general we may say, they are more remarkable for what they do not say than for what they do. While, on the one hand, these bulletins do not contain what most men fear, they are nearly as remote from, offering what all men hope for-viz., the King's actual recovery. The great and important rally of last Saturday has not been followed up by any steady or considerable improvement at all in proportion to that first great step; and tbough, on the whole, the patient has passed from a state of torpor, alternating with obscure apprehension and wandering speech, to a more healthy succession of sleep and waking, together with clear recognition of persons and things, clear articulation, and the use of the physical organs, still the improvement seems hardly steady and unfluctuating enough to justify the very sanguine hopes that are entertained here by many w hose judgment appears to me to be influenced by their affections or their interests. There appears certainly fair ground for expecting as well as hoping that the King willUget over this special attack, but, with a knowledge of how little he is likely to conform himself vahen recovered to the prescriptions of his medical advisers, it is, I fear, too much to expect that he will not have another return of it beforo long; and as the King's whole frame and habit of body favour the probability of a softening of the brain having already supervened, it will require very positive dicta from competent authorities before the uninitiated world can have the gratification of dismissing its fears. The King's birthday falls the day after to-morrow (Thursday), and though the apprehensions are now at an end lest the day of rejoicing-as it usually is observed here-should be converted into a day of mourning, still arrangements are being made for avoidinganythinglike the usual demonstrations onthe part of the people. There is to be no illumination, but the money that this would have cost is to be given to the poor; no dancing at the various barracks, nor at any public place of amusement; the Ministers will not give their usual entertainments, but the Minister President will receive the VisitB and expressions of condolence or congratulation on the pert of the Diplomatic Body, to be by him conveyed to the King. Since Sunday last the theatres have been restrained from performing other than serious pieces, and the various places of public entertainment have excluded from their bills of fare every item the style of which could in any way be exposed to the imputation of levity. At the same time not only in Fotadam, but also here in the Dom, or Cathedral, daily evening service has been performed with special reference to the King's illnees; and attendance at Divine service next Thursday morning will be the only open celebration of the Sing's birthday exhibited by the Ministers anx the more prominent members of the bureaucracy here. The UJniversity and the schools, and the whole of the garrison, will, however, celebrate the day in the usual manner, with the exception of their not indulging in any noisy festivities. In order to keep the population of Berlin correctly informed of the state of the King's health, copies of the official bulletins are exhibited in all the district police-officeg, together with other reliable information on the subject. This forethought to prevent anything like panic bas extended itself so far as to cause one of the early buletino, although drawn up by His Mlajesty's own physicians, to be cancelled, because it mentioned that the King had been bled, and the same watchful anxiety for other persons' equanimity prevents any but the most guarded and favouLrable news being forwarded by the telegraph. The following is the latest bulletin of the King's health received by telegraph:- "SANS SOUCI, OcT. 13, 7.30 P.ir. "During the course o' to-day His Majesty the King has been free from further attacks of congas, tion. On the whole, however, there is no marke4 change in the condition of His Majeaty. " SCBONL7gLN. "GPRIMM *WEIS&* THE DANUBIAN PRINCIPAIaj E S. The followving is the opy of a despatch addressed by Aah Pasha, on the 23d of September, 1857, to the Ottoman Legations at the Courta which wrere parties to the Treaty of Paris :_= "Annexed I send you a copy of a despatoh which we forwart(l to the Kainakan of Moldavia immediately slta tbe elections were annulled. The content of the docum3ant will enable you to see In what a loyal spirit the Porte fqfil its engagemnenta "The Imperial Government, by the Minister7ia de. spRtch of October 14th, 1856, aud by its subsequent axl prceaing declarations, has nOt failed in the same loyal way to make known to the angust parties to the Treaty ;f Paris the views which it takes of the question relative to the Danubian Principalities. We are convinced that the bigh Powers, who by the solemn act of the Congre3s of Paris proclaimed to the whole world the great interest they took in the maintenance ot the intogrity and independeuce of this empire, will be obligei to the Sublime Porte for eni deavourlng to point out the side of this question that relate; to an interest which has become European. (Chercher 2 feur d&montrcr 'e c4M de ctcUe qution qui touche cc grand isWrii dercnu REropCen.) God forbid that the Government of His Majesty the Saltan should call in question the purity of the intentions of any of the Powers towards him or that it should believe that in upholding this or that opinion they entertain any other wish than to give strngtlh to the principle above.mentloned. If we frequently return to this subject, it is simply beeanse we, being most directly interested in it, ish to enlighten our alies, and not to leave themi In ignoranoO of the delorminatlon (lXopiniom aritde) of the Sublime Porte on a matter which fends to inflict a severe blow upon its legitimate rightsrighte which are consecated by ages and unexceptionable docnments-and to endeavour to destroy any unfavourable impression which some hundreds of publications which hAYe been disseminated by the opposite party may hare producedt on the minds of the Governments or of the nations. A A new and frank explanation on the part of the Porte appears to us the more opportune because, since th5 electlons in Moldavia have been annulled, the quasi revolutionary clabs in Wallachia have produoed a very Eensible discouragement among those Inhabitants of 1olda_ via and Wallachia who formerly dared to display some little courage in the maintenanoe of their opinions (qui nagmnrc osaient montrcr qu,ce peu de courage de lrut opinion). Assemblies elected under such auspices neither are nor can be of a nature to inspire the Stblime Porte with any great confidence that they will respect its rightL Con. equently, at the same time that it keeps within the limits of the Treaty of the 30th Mareh, the Imperil Government considers it a duty to renew the sforesid declaration of the 14th October, and frankly to declare that, whatever may be the wish expressed by the Divans ad hoc relative to the union of the two Principalities, the Snblime Porte, relying on (s8appuyant Sur) the text of the Treaty of Paris-a text, In virtue of 'which the final settlement of the definitive organization of th'e Principalities is to depend entirely on. an understanding between the Sublime Porte and the other Powers who were parties to the treaty-finds itself absolately necessitated to maintain its resolution In this respect. " We confidently hope that this determination, which is based on reasons that are of vital importance to Turkey, wiUl be appreciated by the Powers, to whom we addres ourselves with the greatest confidence We are convinced that their justice and equity will come to our assistance in this Important matter. " I hasten to add that by this our restriction we do not intend to exclude all Idea of the assimilation of certain ad. ministrative laws that may be reconcilable with the rights of our august master, and with the maintenance of the political separation of the two provinces. " The good understnding which has happily been re' established between all the Powers that were parties to tha Treaty of Paris concerning the affairs of the provinces in question is for us another guarantee that they wil be satis. factorily settled, We, as one of the parties to the treaty, cannot too strongly wish that the good understanding may continue.

[Annex] AAu PASHA TO THE KAIAAN OF MOLDAVIA- " 'M. le Prince, -My telegraphic despatch of the 24th inst. has made known to you the resolution taken by the Porte, in consequence of an understanding between itself and the six other Powers who were parties to the Treaty of Paris, to annul the Moldavian elections. By your deo spatch of the 25th we learnt how promptly you had proK ceoded to put into exeoution the order of His Majesty the Sultan. I have Daothing to add in respect to the instruc. tions whioh were given in my abovementionedi message. In regard to the method of their execution, I consider it nmy duty again to make known to your Excellency the real opinion of the Sublime Porte on the subject. Before all, I have the honour to inform you that the Imperial Goverm. ment is as jealous of its inalienable (imprescri.ptible) rights, and is as determined to maintain them, as it is to fulfil the duties arising from Its engagements. Thus the Sublime iPorte can have no other wish than to see that part of It3 engagements the accomplishment of which devolves on authorities of its appointment fulfilled with the greatest uprightness and fi'clity. We are of opiniont that, in order to attain this object, your Excellency cannot do bet'er than literally to follow the instructiong of the firman relating to the eloctions with the Wallachian interpretation, the application of which under sImilar circumstances in Moldavia has been agreed on by all the Powers. In this way the responsibility of your Excellency will be sheltered (d couvcrt), and the Sublime Porte will be extremely pleased that you have fulfilled its intentions. " ' The Porte, M. le Prince, counts, in this important matter, on your devotion to the interests of the empire in general, and to those of the Principality in particular. " ' A ccept, &c.

THB CAPE OF GOOD ROPE. [The following appeaed in our second edition of yes. terday:-1 We have received files of papers from the Cape to the 15th of August. Her Majesty's steamer Penelope and troopship Belleisle left Simon's Bay for India on Wednesday, the 12th. The Ocean Wave, with a portion of the 89th, was to leave on the 15th for India. On the 13th the ship Polonaise arrived from Dublin, which she left June 18, with a detachment of Her Majesty's 95th Regiment on board, consisting of 17 officers and 316 rank and file, under the command of Major Raines. The 95th was to have relieved the 89th at Cape Town, but, under present circumstances, the regiment proceeds to India. We take the following from the Cape Toitn MaiZ of the 15th August:- " The statement of the revenne of tho colony for the year ending the 30th of Juno, 1857, shows a net increase over tho revenue for the same period ending the 30th of June, 1856 of 91,319. Nearly the whole of this is due to the Customs' on which there has been an increase of 90,2524 Tho total receipts for the year ending the 30th of June, 1857, were 376,9901.; the total expenditure for the same period 320,3201., leaving a balanco in favour of receipts oC 96.670l. "In 1837 the revenuo was 167,0371, In 1847 it wv3 222,013Z In the year ending the 30th of June, 1857, it was 376,9901. As the revenue is derived chiefly fromx Customs, transfer, and auction dues, it affords - pretty fair view of the progress of the colony im population, wealth, and mode of living. The value o° the colony has thus been doubled in the last 20 years; but in the last ten years the progress has been more rapid, and if the powers now at work are vigorously applied and well directed the increae in the next ten years will be muchL greater. The increase in the last 20 years has been gene. rally ascribed to the introduction of fine-woolled sheeop. That process is stiUl going on and extending. But the addition of imnnigration, new lines of road, and railroads, will effect a change not less extensive in the total VWine of the colony."
DiscoviCy OP ANLO-SAXON RgMSAnS.-Soma interesting Saxon funereal deposits bave been reoently brought to hht near ScarLorough. There Is a knoll of chalk rock wvlch forms almost the whole of tho high land called Seamer Moor, a great part of which has been cut away by a very extensive lime quarry. A few days ago the, wife of one of the quarrymen brought into Scarborough several gold ornaments and other articles, and sold them to a shopkeeper, from whom they soon passed to Lord Londesborough. Having ascartained the spot where these objects bad been found, Lord Londesborough resolved immediately to have the place dug, and on Thursday last he and Mr. Thomas Wright (thea on a visit to his lordship) commenced! rekearches. In sifting the earth that had been tbrown dowv, there was found a beautiful lozenge, shaped pendant, set with stones, an extremely elegant gold pin with an enameled head, soveral fragments of other ornaments, and a great quantity of fragments of iron and pottery. Tbe ground above was then trenched, but only one grave vas found. It coDtained 3 bkeleton, wlth a few ordinary aticles in brouse and iron.

LONDON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1857. The Bishop of OXPORD and Mr. GLADSTONE have spoken upon Indian affairs in a manner that shows what we are to expect when Parliament meets and the discussion begins. As men of religious convictions, they reprobate the " tinidity" of a system which can no longer claim even the shallow plea of success, and which has not escaped the charge of that proselytism which for a century it has done its utmost to avoid. Indifference is bad, irreligion is worse; but worse BtiliB a religion which, not contentwith lettingothers alone, crushes its friends, lest it should offend its foes, and is thus continually betraying its own interests and belying its own truth. At home we have often deplored a policy which English people were told was no concern of theirs, and which they were wholly unfit to pronounce upon. So the Bishop of OXFOnD and Mr. GLADSTONE represent the feeling of their countiy, and display at the same time the tact of practised orators, when they address themselves to the two flagrant facts of Anglo-Indian dread of Christian zeal, and Indian mutiny. If there is not a necessary connexion between these two facts, and if the mutiny is to human eye rather in spite of our precautions than in consequence of them, it is the fault of the Anglo-Indias Government that we cannot help associating these two things. Those of us who are old enough can remember what the Bishop of OxrFonD states with much force, that the East India Company (for there was a company in those days) steadily resisted the invasion of Christianity, step by step, into their unhallowed soiL They fought hard first against the adnission of missionaries, then against regular chaplains, then against a Bishop; and when poor Bishop MinDDLToN went at last he landed, lived, worked, and died under a constant umrelenting protest by the authorities, who were determined t3 show the natives that they had nothing to do with him. The present position of a Bishop in India, such as it is, we owe to the great abilities and singularly engaging qualities of HIEE. The other incidents aluded to by the Bishop of OXFORD have already been brought before our readers; and, though the single instance of a Christian Sepoy being deprived of his place in his regiment, and sent to vegetate on his pay, proves rather the narrowness than the extent of the actual persecution, it is exceedingly significant. One case is enough In such matters, and is quite conclusive as to the line taken by the authorities. But what is the occasion of instances, when the general practice is admitted, defended, and even now stickled for? This is the most prominent topic of the Bishop's speeches at Chester, and in laying so much stress upon it he is only taking up a cause opened | by his father more than seventy years ago. The " timidity " complained of is constitutional, beginning with the infancy of the Company. The best comment on it is the mutiny of the whole Bengal Army on a caste plea. What avail our precautions ? To stifie flEavEN-sent doctrines and to shut up good tidings intended for the whole world is bad enough. But it has been done in vain. The sin has been committed without obtaining its reward. As the hired assassin, instead of getting his money, is often put out of the way, so the Anglo-Indian Government has not even the consolation of a profitable wrong. For anything it has got it might as well have been Christian. That is very hard. Neither the Bishop, however, nor Mr. GLADSToNE has attempted to get at the real mystery of the affair, andi the most important part of the question, which is our actual religious position in India and the religious aspect we present in the eyes of the native. We much doubt whether " timidity," or a fear of bringing down a religious reaction, is a fuU account of the matter. But is there any doubt about it? There is nothing in the way of moral phenomena so distinct, so pronounced, so obvious to the apprehension, as the religious tone of Indian politicians. Old and young, civilians or soldiers, however much they may disagree on minor points, are generally agreed on taking a most amiable view of Hindooism, Mahomedanism, idolatries, and delusions of all kinds. Few of them seem to think it makes any difference what a man is so long as he observes the decencies -that is, some of the decencies- of his religion, whatever it is. They have a recipe for resolving into a substantial identity all the religions under the sun, the varieties being only according to climate, race, or mere accident. The philosophy and fables of Hindooism they think partly above, partly below, our level; and, on the other hand, they think Cbristianity utterly unsuited for the native of India, and evidently not intended for him. This is not timidity, but indifference, or a very comprebensive sort of latitudinarianism, Some people oall it Pantheism, and tell us further that the Hindoos are Pantheists, and that we take it from them. However that may be, Indian authorities are not so much afraid of exciting a religious warfare in India as careless, on principle, about the matter altogether, thinking it reaUy no object to convert the natives, who answer our purpose better as ilindoos, or even as MIussulmans, than they would as members of our own faith and communion. This, too, is the light in which we are naturally and correctly regarded in India. We are not suspected of any deep-laid plans of proselytism. At a recent meeting of the British Indian Association at Calcutta, composed of native gentlemen of the highest standing, they simply express their utter surprise at the remarks made by Lord EaTLBopouG} in the House of Lords on certain alleged proselytizing acts of Lord CANNMIG and the alleged fears of the Indians for their religion. The mutiny, they say, has no such source, and the perfect toleration of the British Government is known and appreciated throughouit all India. Our policy is manifestly that of AcKBAn, and not that of AUpGU,ZEBE. The former of these, as was further stated at the meeting, encouraged the followers of all sects, religions, and modes of worship. "Jageers and Allumghas bearing his imperial seal are yet extant to show that "he assigned lands and buildings for the endow"ment of Mahomedan Musjids, christian Churches, and Hindoo Devaloys." Such has always been the practice of the Hindoos, and the Mahomedan Prince established his authority by adopting it, in place of the intolerance prescribed by his own creed. Hindoos, as it appears from some remarks made at the same meeting, have the highest respect for the Christian missionaries, classing them with the most eminent saints and most holy men of their own system ; but it is quite evident that they regard our civil Government and the whole fabric of our power as utterly indifferent, as having no religion whatever, as being neither of any caste nor of that piety which in India makes caste and is an evidence of caste. Can it be doubted, however, that to zealots, like the Mahomedans, and formalists, like the Hindoos, mere indifference must be more odious than bigotry, even were it also a little intolerant ? Indeed, to both of the great religions of the Indian Penins,la the line we take and the general inconsistency of our habits with our faith put us at once into the great class of outcasts. If this be indeed the light in which we Are regarded, then is it time for the present guardians and pillars of the Indian Empire to clear themselves from the opprobrium of a rude and vulgar indifference. Simply as Christians we might be hated by the Musaulmans, and should not be despised; while by the Hindoos we should be neither hated nor despised. In their eyes we should be a caste, as, indeed, we are, though formed, perpetuated, and sanctified on other principles and by other means than the castes of their own system. But on this point the testimony of the native gentlemen of Calcutta is conclusive. They respect all religionists in exact proportion to their zeal and consistency. What they do not respect is irreligion. What they hate, besides, is an irreligious insolence and contempt towards the religion of others. On one point, in which we feel ourselves rather concerned, we must beg to call ir. GLADsToN1rs attention to the facts of the case. He informs the good people of Chester that the malicious and dishonest remarks in certain foreign journals-meaning, of course, the Urivers and other organs of that school-are the consequence of the cry for retribution made by the English Press. That Mr. GLADSTOmS might imagine this, or anything else, in the heat of declamation, we can easily believe, but we never read a statement that had less foundation in facts. The ultramontane journals, and some others always hostile to this country, have exulted over our calamity from the very commencement. Throughout they have described it as the just punishment of our sins, and probably the beginning of our end. We have read probably as much of this stuff as most people, yet we have never yet met with a word to indicate that the Univers, for example, or Dr. Curim-, would have taken a different view of the case had the Euglish Press filled its columns with appeals to Christian forbearance. The whole tone of these foreign journals is retrospective and vindictive. So far fromn being of that insulated and accidental character suggested by Mr. GLADSTONE, it is of a piece with a system of attack running through the columns of the same journals for years on all the affairs of this country. Mr. GLADSTO.NE must have allowed his personal animosities to carry him very far, when he ascribed the deep, rapid, persevering torrent of abuse that runs through these foreign journals to a few expressions that appeared the other day in the journals of this country. He might as well have referred the Falls of Niagara to the heavy showers of rain that fell here in September. Nor is this the only misrepresentation which we have to request MIr. GLA.DSTOxNE to correct at his leisure. Neither we nor any other English journal, that we know of, has recommended indiscriminate slaughter, or any act of retribution beyond what may be required by the necessities of war or of policy. It may or may not be sound policy to destroy the edifices of a city which has been the scene of horrible inhumanities. Such measures have long been thought necessary in India, and, if necessary, they are really humane; but we have no wish to see them adopted without good reason, and certainly not with needless cruelty.
The Druids of antiquity preserved a striking custom of confining men, women, and children together in huge machines, and then setting fire to the vehicle and its contents, so that the unfortunate prisoners were all burnt alive in a heap. We have no doubt these immolations were very awful spectacles. The scale of sacrifice was clearly comprehensive, and the representations of the ceremony still given in rudimentary manuals of history are very impressive indeed. Against any revival, however, of the practice in these present days we do most vehemaently protest, and especially under conditions which expose all of us at all times to the possible infliction of the penalty. Even the Druids wreaked their will upon captives alone, but railway companies take their own friends and best customers, lock them in vehicles without the means of escape, attach a large roaring furnace to the front of the procession, and then leave them all to the chances of combustion without so much as a possibility of giving an alarm. Here follows an example of the practice very pret'ily illustrated:- Last Friday a train left the Slough station on the Great Western Railway at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, timed to arrive at Paddington within half an hour afterwards. Presently one of the carriages proved to be on fire. The unfortunate people inside hastened, with the instinct of selfpreservation, to pile their coats and wraps over the place, and if possible to stifle the blaze, whi'e ladies were set to work upon their peculiar specialties, and commissioned to disturb the neighbourhood as promptly as possible by incessant screams. The inmates of a carriage adjoining, duly mindful of the ancient maxim that a fire isext dGor makes the matter one's own, contrihated their efforts also towards attracting attesuion, and hung out entiaporind signala with handker9hidfs) uw brellss, and such like implements. All this, however, was of no avail. Fanned by the air, the fire rapidly gained upon the carriage, the intensity of the heat split the glass into fragments, flames darted out of the windows, and when the train at length was brought to a stanid just by the ticket platform it was evident that in a few seconds more the imprisoned passengers must have been burnt to death. As it was, they escaped with a few fainting fits, some gashes from the flying splinters of glass, and half-an-hour's agony of the most frightful kind. Three days later occurs another instance of similar character. A train travelling from Carlisle to Lancaster carried a lot of luggage, as usual, upon the roof of one of the vehicles, and this took fire. The rapid motion of the carriages through the air of course blew up the flames prodigiously, and in a few minutes fiery flakes and cinders were flying by the windows. How mnany seconds it would have taken to burn tbrough the roof of the carriage and let the whole red-hot mass down upon the passengers below we cannot attempt to calcu'ate, but fortunately the train was stopped in time to preven' the catastrophe. A lady who had been anxious to jump out of the carriage was luckily held in by force, and no life therefore was lost ; but here again the prospect of a torturing death must have inflicted an agony beyond estimate or description. Now, this really will not do. Burning alive is not a thing to be risked or tolerated. We have put it down even in India, and we can't have it in England. It is folly to talk of the danger being imaginary or the risk infinitesimally small. No train ever leaves a station without the chance of such perils. Let any man look at a railway train as it passes, and observe the sparks which fly fiercely from the fire-box even during the few seconds it is in sight. Or, to take a piece of standing testimony, look at the grass banks of a cutting during the heat of summer, and see how the parched herbage has caught fire and smouldered. As a matter of course, cinders must be flying about, projected in all directions from the engine as it tears along, and, as a matter of course also, whenever these red-hot shots are pitched upon any part of the train so as to set it on fire the motion of the train itself acts like the most powerful bellows in the world. The wonder is that we do not hear of such conflagrations every week. I i It is not proposed by way of remedy to extinguish the furnace, or intercept the draught, or build railway carriages of iron, or take any other violent, extravagant, or impracticable course. All that is as,ked on behalf of passengers is, that when the vehicle in which they are confined is set fire to they may be allowed to give notice to the conductors of the train, and get out, instead of remaining inside and being burnt. We reaUy don't think this an unreasonable demand; but at present there is no chance of such escape. See what took place in the cases above related. On the Great Westrn Railway the ladies shriek-ed, the gentlemen signalled out of window, and every expedient was employed by means of which a carriage full of passengers could hope to communicate a knowledge of their alarm to the world without. The conflagration itself, too, was so fierce and extensive that the fire burnt furiously for half an hour after the stoppage of the train, and three out of the four compartments of the carriage were reduced to ashes. Yet neither by screams, signals, smoke, nor blaze could the least impression be made upon either guard or driver, and the alarm seems at last to have been given to a policeman on the line about 300 yards before the spot where the train would have stopped in the ordinary way. In the second instance the circumstances were still more remarkable, as showing how even the most daring efforts may be quite ineffeetual. Here a passeDger got out of the carriage, and actually worked his way along the train while it was in motion until he reached the guard at the end. But when this desperate exploit had been aecomplished help was no nearer than before, for the guard had no means of communicating with the driver. Again, however, the same volunteer ventured upon a forlorn hope, and endeavoured by the same route to reach the driver himself. As it happened, some persons at work on the line had seen aud appreciated the extraordinary position of affairs, and had given an effectual note of warning by placing detonating signals on the rails, so that the driver thus obtained information of the danger and stopped the train. In neither of these cases, be it observed, was the last extremity of peril escaped by any resource provided within the train itself. Had it not been for the policeman in one instance and the labourers in the other, the travellers, in all human probability, must have been burnt alive, for it is clear that we cannot reckon such courage and activity as were displayed by the passenger above-mentioned among the ordinary means of relief. Yet all these frightful liabilities and terrors might unquestionably be escaped by the simple establishment of a regular communication between each carriage and the conductors of the train. The machinery required for such a purpose involves no difficulty; it is actually in use in other countries, and is sometimes employed here. The only reason given against its adoption is that unnecessary and inconvenient stoppages might be occasioned when such power was at any person's command. We do not see why Englishmen should give more trouble than Americans in this respect, but, whether they would or not, the mere rirk of such inconvenience cannot be balanced for a moment against the dangers of actual combustion, and it is plainly high time that the duty of providing this necessary communication should be included among the obligations which railway companies are naturaUy desirous of escaping, but which they can accept and discharge with very little difficulty when they find they have no alternative.
The main drainage of London seems likely to advance but 81owly for many a day. The proceedings in connexion with this grand schenrce move at a pace which is little better than stagnation. It will be remembered that some montis since the Metropolitan Board of Works sent in the plan of their chief engineer, PIr. P,AZALGETTE. The idea ot this gentleman was to carr y the sewage of the metropolis to a certain point on the river, and there to disgorge it, to be bor'ne away by tho stream as best might be. But, the scheme was very far from recommending itself to the public or to persons in authority. PIc was evident to the plainest common sense tha'c the work would be only half done. The Tha=res might drain London, but who should drain the Thames ? If an outfall were created at Erith, or any similar spot on the river, it was certat that not only would the vicinity be ruined for the purpose of habitation, but that in course of time a bank or shoal would be formeO,, which might seriously obstruct the navigation of the river, to say nothing of the disease that might possibly be engendered by such an accumul ation of filth. Then, it was much doubted whether the Thames at London would really bhr purified by these means. This is a tidal rirer, and an outfall at Erith would be no security agairLst the whole mass being carried backwards and forwards between the mouth of the main sewer and the metropolitan bridges. These objections were so evident that it wvas felt that the scheme wa not one to be submitted to Parliameat, Sir BFNJTA.- HALL accordingty7, without positively reJecting it, announced to the Board that it would be submitted to three engineerg of his own -selection, who would report upon the whole plan, and make any amendments they thought proper. Nor were they to be confined within any narrow limits; the three referees would be allowed to propose a plan entirely different from that of Mr. BAZALGETTh, should it seem to them that he had failed to appreciate and to surmount the difficulties of the question. Thus the whole scheme was, in fact, taken out of the hands of the Board of Works and transferred to Sir B. HAaL's department, which miglt propose other measures, and obtain Parliamentary sanction for them, without any interference from the assembly constituted for the purpose of dealing with the question. The three referees went to work, and, as was to 'oe expected, made short work of Mr. BAzALGITTe's scheme. The report of Messrs. GALTON, SrnirsoX, and B3CKNVELL has now in turn been laid before the Board by order of Sir B. HALL. At the meeting which took place on Wednesday this report was the object of almost unanimous attack. The principal points appear to be as follows :-The' report agrees with the original scheme so far as I to recommend a high level sewer on the north and south sides of the Thames. They propose to carry the sewage across the river at Battersea, where it will be raised to the high level sewer, so as to arrive at the Thames by: gravitation. On each side of the Thames there I would be constructed a main channel 16 feet deep and 38 wide, with a fall of 6 inches in the mile. These cuttings would commence at Barking on the north and at Woolwich on the south side. They w ould both be open during their whole course, and* the sewage would descend to Sea Reach solely by the force of gravitation. The result of this scheme, if successful, would be, that the river would be entirely freed from pollution, that the' suburban spots on its banks would ecape destruction, and that the entire sewage of London would be carried to the sea easily, and, it may be presumed, cheaply. On the other hand, open trenches of filth 18 miles long, 38 feet wide, and 16 feet deep through two metropolitan counties can hardly be looked upon as very desirable works in themselves, and it can only be an imperative necessity which would justify such a sacrifice of certain localities for the benefit of the metropolis. Again, it is questioned by the opponents of the scheme whetherit is foundedonsoundengineering principles. Would a fall of six inches a-mile be sufficient to carry away matter such as is poured oust by London drains ? Again, there is, according to the. opponents of the plan, a fatal error of calculation in the height of the reservoirs. We needc not go into the question. It is sufficient to say that it is doubted whether a sufficient supply of water can be obtained to carry away the con- i tents of the cuttings. So Mr. CARPMAEL, at the i meeting on Wednesday, proposed that the report i of Sir B. H4i's three engineers shou]d be referredcl to Mr. BAZALGETTE and two other engineers for their opinion. However, the sense of the Board was against even this degree of concession, and another member proposed the absolute rejection of the new scheme. The open sewers with diminished falls were professedly the great objection to the plan of the Chief Commissioner's referees. The majority of the Board, asserting that the proposition of Mr. CAnRi.AL would create delay, while that of Mr. WRIGIT would bring matters to a decision, accepted the latter; though how the object of the Board's existence can be furthered by an absolute rejection of the newv scheme we are unable to see. However, the Board was not satisfied until it had passed another resolution-that open sewers are perfectly inadmissible, and that it would not be justified in carrying out any scheme of which open sewers formed a part. Such is the present condition of things. The Commissioner rejected Mr. BAZALOaTTE'S scheme because it did not carry away the sewageI at all, and the Board rejects the Com-i missioner's scheme because it does not carry it away in an unexceptionable manner. Between the two pertis things remain as they were, and the state of the growing metropolis daily becomes worse. We trust the Board has not been: actuated by anything like pique in thisj affair. Its own plan was confessedly insufficient. To send the sewage of London a few miles down the river, to be washed back- ! wards and forwards at each turn of the tide, could satisfy no man of common reflection. The plan nosw proposed will certainly, if successful, do. what was intended to be done-London and its river will be delivered from pollution. The onlY question is whether the proposition is founded on true principles, and that may be decided by the profession. Whether the cuttings, shall be open or covered is a question solely of! expense; and we trust that in the forthcoming " conference" the two parties may be able to' agree to some plan which shall unite the real attainment of the object with that decency and' regard to the public health on which the Board is inclined to insist.

ABTS TRBASURES EXHIBITION. hiANCHESTER, OCT. 15. Yet two days more and ths Manchester Exhibition will only be matter for future art historiams to deal with. There have been requisitions, petitions, and general protests got up among the citizens of Manchester to obtain a respite of at least another week before the final closing. All of them were numerously, and some most influentially, signed, and the executive committee were even tempted, through the medium of their patriotic and kindly feelings, by the suggestion that the proceeds of another week should be devoted towards the fund for the relief of the Indian sufferers. This morning the executive committee held a special meeting to consider and decide upon the various reasons and suggestions which had been urged in favour of a still further extensoion of the period fixed for closing. That meeting has only just terminated, and the result is that the commitee have deeided to adhere to their original determination, and the announcement that the building iu to close on Saturday next for ever will be rigidly adhered to. That the committee have exercised a most wise discretion in keeping faith with the public in this as in all other matters cannot be doubted, and the result of this decision, though not unecpected, hha neverthe3egs disappointed many; for now a late repentauce is seizing on al the votaries of art, and though the admission is raised to half-a-crown yet the building never was more crowded, and nearly ninetenths of the Tisitors pay at the door. Nwxly all these visitors are strangers to the city, the hotels there are full to overflowing, beds are neither to be had for love nor money, though the latter at least is said to have some influence in Manchester, and the number of destitute travellers and carpetbags which are thrown upon the streets by every train is- really alnost painful to behold. Atthe respectable-hotels the porters truly seem to have nothing else to do but stad upon the steps and turn away the tourist appLicants all day long. At the openln of the Arts Treasures the influx of visitors to Manahester was at least as much as was anticipated. During the Queen's visit also the rush was great, but neither event appears to have produced the same influence as the approaching termination of the Exhibition itself. Yet the final close of the building is to be marked by no pageant or ceremonial of any description. The bands of the 4th Light Dragoons, the 36th Regiment, and the large band usually performing in the Palace will be present on that occasion, and perform "(God Save te Queen" while the bell is ringing visitors out for the last time. Beyond this there will be no departure froma the usual proceedings With regard to- the success of the Exhibition in a financial point of, view it would perhaps be premature to venture on. anticipations at the present, when the report on this sabject to the executive committee is still incomplete. However, from what has transpired, there seems no reason to doubt that the whole proceeds will leave neither loss nor profit to the axecutive committee, that, in fact, the receipts will, about meet the expenditure and nothing more. In either way the gain or deficit is likely to be small, though a general impression prevails in the city that it will rather ba short of the expenditure than otherwise. The return of the check-tskers up to 3 o'clockl today showsd that upwardia of S,OW(} visitors had paid at the door, and at that time the arrivals were still almost continuous. Among other visitors -were the Duke and Dachess of RoxNlurgh and Lady Charlotte Innes Kerr, the Ducheas of Manchester, Viscount Ranelagh, Lord WYard, Sir AuguatnaClifford, Sir George Armytage, Lady Catherine Egerton, Lord Grey de WYilton, the Right Revs, the 13ishops of Manchester, Oxford, and F,xeter; the Marchionesa of Ailesbury, the COutss of Hardwicke and the Ladies Yorke, the Viscoutesx Newport, Lady Emma Stanley, Miss Florence Nightingale, W.

I N D IA. We have received together the Dombay and Calcutta mails. The dates from Bombay are to the 17th of September; the dates from Calcutta are to ehe 9th of September inclusive. We take the following from the Oeerland Bombay ?times:- " The Indian revolt has not during the last fortmight been marked by any very stirriing events, -and neither of the contending parties has gained any decisive advantage over the other. The 'British forces throughout India have been inactive, awaiting reinforceruents before striking the final blow, which will crush the hopes of the miitineers. -On the whole, however, our prospects may be con-sidered cheering ; for, while the rebels have obtained no fresh success, we have had considerable accessions of strength by the a.rival of fresh troops, both at Bombay and Calcutta. When these reinforcements reach the seat of war in the disturbed provinces our armies will be enabled to resume offensive operations and bring affairs to a crisis. "General Havelock, who had recrossed the Ganges after his unstcecessfiul attempts to relieve Lucknow, rested for a few days at Cawnpore, his troops having rbeen much crippled by sickness. On the 16th of August the force marched towards Blthoor, where a large body of the enemy, about 4,000 in number, with two gurs, was posted. They occupied a strong defensive position in a village to the west of Bhitoor, which they desperately defended. Bavelock's force muastered 1,300 men with about 14 guns. The right -wing was towards the Ganges, and the left on a deep nullah crossed by a bridge. After an obstinate engagement, in which the enemy lost 250 killed and wounded, they were driven from their position, and fled in confusion, leaving their guns behind. In this contest the British troops lost about 14 killed and 30 wounded, besldes some of their baggage. After the action lHavelock's force retired towards Cawnpore, where they arrived on the 20th of Augulst, after a harassing and fatiguing march, during which they suffered severe privations, which were patiently borne by our gallant soldiers. Cholera had made its appearance among the men, carrying off 10 or 12 daily, but the ravages of this epidemic had since begun to abate. General Outram arrived at Allahabad on 'the 1st of September, with Her Majesty's 5th Fusileers, the 90th, and a company of Artillery. With this force he hoped to reach Cav.wnpore on the 9th inst. The details of Her Majesty's 04th, 78th, 84tb, and Ist Madras Fusileers would follow on the arrival of Captain Peel and his naval brigade at Allahabad. Sir.James Outramhad -communicated his arrangements to General Havelock, who had in reply stated his perfect confidence in his being able to effect the relief of Lucknow with these reinforcements. General Outram had, with characteristic generosity, announced to General Havelock that 'to him should be left the glory of relieving Lucknow, for which he had so nobly struggled,' and that it was bis intention to accompany the force in his civil capacity, only placing his militarysiervices at the disposal of General Havelock, if necessary. General Havelock was to make arrangements forthe force to move forward from Cawnpore on the arrival of the reinforcements. The rebels have assemubled on the Oude side of the river, opposite to the British camp, in great numbers, and have thrown up a battery. " The garrison at Lucknow, althoughl reduced to great straits, is bravely holding out, and -will no doubt do so until relieved by General Havelock. For some time the situation of the beleaguered garrison was believed to be desperate, and the worst fears were entertained regarding their fate, as no tidings had been received from theni. Letters have since been received, stating that the garrison of Lucknow had communicated with General Havelock, and advised him not to run any risk in attempting to relieve them, as they had provisions enough for six montbs ; that the attacks of the enemy were be- coming fewer and fainter, from the want of ammu- nition, it was supposed ; and it was believed that the enemy were quarrelling among themselves. The latest intelligence received from Lucknow is, that 1,000 of the rebels had collected, and these, with the elite of the rebel force, made an assault on the .devoted ga rieon. They were repulsed with great slaughter, ;2fl0 of the Ghazees being killed, and a great many of the wounded had since died. There is a want of proper food for the ladies and children, but the garrison get beef, and have plenty of grain. They have been ordered to hold out to extremity, anid, with the fate of Cawnpore before their eyes, it is not likely that they will entertain the idea of surrender, with help so close at hand. A letter from Cawnpore, dated the -31st of August, says that 'at present the garrison of Lucknow is all right and in good spirits.' " The Dinapore mutineers, completely broken and dispersed by the prudent combinations of Major 'Eyre, are now endeavouring to make their way to Delhi, across the hiUls in the Mirzapore district. Major Eyre had not succeeded in capturing Kooer Singh, the rebel leader, but a reward ot 10,00ors. has been offered for his apprehension. Those of the mutineers who escaped have taken refuge in the hill country of Rhotusgbiur, whither they were being followed by Major Eyre. They had since passed south of Mirzapore and had -crossed the Tonse river, which flows into the Ganges between Mirzapore and Allahabad. A force under MIajor Hinde from ltowah is endeavouring to intercept them, but it is feared that he will be unable to arrest their progress, which is marked by rapine and pillage. They will probably make towards Delhi, passing through the Banda district, 'which is utterly disorganized. "FromDelhi we have no news of much importance, although the British troops have become bolder In their attack-s upon the enemy, who have been de-. -£eated on every occasion. General Nicholson's column, consisting of Her Majesty's 52d Light Infantry, a wing of Her Majesty's Gist Foot, and several Sikh corps, arrived in the camp on the 11th of August. The auxiliary force furnished by the Sovereign of Cashmere, fully equipped, is also -narching to join General Wilson'a army, which will then be stroDg enough to act on the offensive. Lieutenant Hodson, with a small body of troops, had proved successful against the insurgents in the Rohtuck district, whom he dispersed, killing about 80 of them. General Nicholson, with about 2,000 men and 10 guns, marched on the 25th of August in the direction of Nujuffghur to meet a body of the enemy moving on that place, who were evidently bent on intercepting the sieae train by a flank march on Soneput. On the following day the rebels were defeated after a short encounter, in which they lost 13 guns besides their camp baggage. The loss in GeneralNichoison's brigade was 17 killed and wounded, inclnding Lieutenant Lumsden, of the 08th Native Infantry, who was killed. Lieutenant Gabbett, of fIer Majesty's Glst Foot, died of his wounds; and Lieutenant Elkington, Gist, and Dr. Ireland were both dangerously wounded. On ,the same day the mutineers in the city, thinking that most of our troops had gone after their detachment, made an attack on the camp, but it produced no impression, and was repulsed with heavy loss. After their defeat at Nujulighur the mutineer3 were much disheartened. O)ur troops were preparing for active operations on the arrival of the siege train, whichl was on its way to the camp, and were delighted at the prospect of doing soneting. At Hissar, in the province of omiomtcine, the rebels bave likewise been defeated in their designs. A body of upwards of 2,000 men, horse and foot, attempted to surprise the gate of the town on the 19th of August; but Lieutenant Mildmay, Assistant Political Agent, who received a timely warning, met the assailants with some loyal troops, and totally routed and pursued them, after killing 300 of their number. Other affairs of minor importance have taken place, which will be found recorded elsewhere. " At Agra all was quiet up to the 27th of August, the date of our latest advices. On the 21st a force, consisting of about 150 of the 3d Europeans, under ,Captain Strover, three guns under Lieutenant -Griffin, and 30 mounted Militia, the whole under the command of Major G. J. Montgomery, BrigadeMajor, left the fort with the view of making a demonstration against the insurgents in the neighbourhood of Eattrass. The force entered that place without opposition, but iaelligence having been *received that a large party of the insurgenits from Allyghur was moving down to attack him, Major Montgomery promptly resolved to anticipate them, and accordingly marched out to meet the rebels, who retired into a garden, where they were pro-tected by a wall, and sheltered among the trees. An Ineffectual fire was opened on them, to which they smartly replied, when the fanatics had the audaoity Io rush from under cover right upon the 3d Enropeans, theo is ArWaising order, aad en- deavour to cut them down with their swords A series of hand-to-hand combats then took place,which ended in the enemy being driven away, leaving 300 dead bebind. The remainder fled, pursued by the militia cavalry, and mowed down by the artillery. In this affair, which occurred on the 24th of August, Mr. J. O'Brien Tandy, late manager of the NorthWestern Bank in Calcutta, and Ensign H. L. Marsh, of the 16th Grenadiers, who accompanied the force as volunteers, were killed, and Lieutenant Longueville Clarke, late of the Gwalior Contingent, was severely wounded. The total loss on our side was five killed and 25 wounded. After the action Major Montgomery, although pre sed to follow up his successes, fell back upon Hattrass. "Tie Punjab continues quiet, although several outbreaks have occurred at isolated stations, which have been promptly suppressed by the firmness of the military authorities. On the 19th of August a portion of the 10th Light Cavalry, which had been d- armed at Ferozepore, nautinied and attempted to capture the guns of Captain Woodeock's battery, in which they failed. The mutineers, 100 in number, afte.- having cruelly murdered, Mr. Nelson, the veterir,ary surgeon, rushed at the guns while the artillerymeu were at dinner, but, after killing the European sentry and wounding several others, they were assailed by the Bombay Fusileers, who repulsed them in a most galant manner, although no officers appear to have been present to issue orders. Most of the mutineers. who had captured several horses, succeeded in making their escape, although pursued for some distance by the infantry, with guns. Several having been seized in the cantonment they were tried and executed. The 51st Bengal Native Infantry, stationed at Pesbawur, mutinied on the 28th of August. This regiment having been disarmed some time ago, the Sepoys attempted to seize the arms of the new Sikh corps while the men of the latter were at dinner. In this attempt they were defeated, and, beiDg attacked, they dispersed and Bed. Nearly the whole of them, however, were 'accountedfor' next day, and the villagers and policmwere bringing in the small remnant by twos and threes. Throughout the rest of the Punjab the utmost tranquillity prevails, and the proceedings of the Government are marked by the greatest vigour and judgment. " In the stations of Rajpootana there is an uneasy feeling that the Bombay Sepoys are ripe for mutiny, and several instances of disaffection seem to give colour to the Ssupicion. Besides the mutiny of the 12th Native Infantry at Nusseerabad, and in the Joudpore Legion at Mount Aboo, there was a partial mutiny on the 12th of August, of Captain Bannister's squadron of the 2d Bombay Light Cavalry at Neemuch. Five of the niutineers made their escape, and three were taken with arms in their hands. One man of Her Majesty's 83d Regiment was killed in the affray, and two were wounded. It also appearsthatan extensiveplot to murder every offcer at Neemuchhadbeenorganized, but was fortanately discovered before it took effect. The mutineers of the Joudpoor Legion, being defeated in their attempt on Mount Aboo, directed their steps to Enpoora, their head-quarters, wherethey were received with open arms by their comrades. Having made Lieutenant Connelly, the Adjutant of the corps, a prisoner, and being .reinforced by several detachments, the whole body, with two guns, marched in the direction of Nusseerabad. On this intelligence reaching Nusseerabad, the party of the J oudpore Legion stationed there wag disarmed, and a detachment of a couple of guns, 2d troop Horse Artillery, two companies of Her Mlajesty's 83d Regiment, and some Irregulars, marched thence towards Bewar, where itis supposed they will meet the Legion. Hitherto the execution of a subahdar and four men of the 12th Regiment had restored tranquility at Nusseerabad, where people had begun to settle into the usual dull routine of camp life. Affairs have begun to assume a most serious aspect at Neemuch, and the men of the 2d Light Cavalry can hardly he relied upon; for, independently of private hushed-up rumours, which ascribe to them the darkest treason, the numerous desertions that have taken place, combined with the overt mutiny of one squadron of this corps, justify the presiumption that they will en masse avail themselves of the first favourable opportunity to join the rebels. This opportunity may not be far distant, for large parties of men, under a person said to be a son of the King of Delhi, who has lately joined and concentrated them, have established themselves in the neighbourhood of Neemuch. It has since been runicured that the 2d Cavalry have had their carbines taken away from them, and that the Bheels of the Joudpore Legion have returned to 13rinpoora, and set their Adjutant, Lieutenant Connelly, at liberty. Another report states that an outbreak had taken place in a detachment of the 2d Light Cavalry at Deesa, whichwas destroyed by Her Majesty's 83dlRegiment, who are said to have shot or bayonetted the troops to a man. " The Bengal Presidency is more or less in a disturbed state, and great fears are entertained for the safety of the frontier stations, which are quite denuded of troops in consequence of the general defection of the native army. At Jalpigoree, on the 11th of August, an attempt to excite disaffection amlong the 73d Bengal Native Infantry was signally defeated, An armed Brahmin appeared among the men, and called on them to kill their officers, and fight for their religion. In answer he was told that if he did not lay do vn his arms he would be shot, and as he persisted in his attempt to excite revolt he was killed by a Brahmin Sepoy. The 5th Bengal Irregulars mutinied at Bhaugulporo on the 14th of August, and left the station, carrying their arms with them. They passed Bwwsee on their way up the country, and endeavoured to tamper with the 32d Rtginient, stationed there, but the latter proved faithful, and will, no doubt, remain so. The 55th Bengal Native Infantry were disarmed at Ghazeepore on the 10th of August. The affair appears to have been capitally managed, for the Sepoys were surrounded and ordered to pile arms before they knew what was meant. The 5th Fusileers were the troops that performed this good service. Near Mirzapore the enemy began to assemble, but were dispe;-aed by a party of the 5th Fusileers. A naval brigade is to be established at Allahabad, so as to release the troops of that station for other duty. Captain Peel, of Her Majesty's steam-frigate Shannon, who distinguished himself in the Crimea, is to command the brigade, which is to consist of 300 seamen taken from the Shannon and Pearl. Six (8-pounders (8-inch), two 241b. howitzers, and two fieldpieces accompasly the brigade, which has left Calcutta ixn river steamers, and is now makinTg its way towards Allahabad. This station and Benares are threatened by the Oude rebels, who are hovering about in large bodies, but, as precautions have been taken to guard against a surprise, they are considered safe. The fort at Allahabad is in a complete state of defence, and the intrenchments at Rajghaut, in Benares, are approaching completion. The station of Goruckpore, in Oude, has been abandoned, causing great loss to the non-official residents. The force of 3, 000 Ghoorkas which was to protect that place have withdrawn to Aziu3ghur, where 1,000 will remain in garrison while 2,000 proceed immediately to restore order in Jaunpore. Accounts were received at Benares on the 24th of August, stating that a day or two previously an attack was made on the Ghoorka camp by a body of rebels under a man named Mahomed Hoosain, who had come over from Oude to assume the government of Gortickpore for the King. The Ghoorkas behaved nobly, and beat back the enemy, with the loss of 150 killed. On the 23d of August a detachment of the 1st Madras Fulileers and a few Sikhs proceeded 60 miles up the Ganges in the gunboat Jumna to cut off coinmunication between Oude and the Doab. They killed about 43 of the rebels, and burnt two boats. Major M'Intyre, of the ,8th Highlanders, at the same time advanced from Allahabad with a small body of men and two guns, anid burnt three villages on the Cawnpore road, restoring the communication with that place. A column of troops, consisting of the left -wing of Her Majesty's 53d Regiment, the 27th Madras Native Infantry,.and a company of M11adras Artillery, are advancing from Raneegunge, the termints of the Calcutta Railvay, on the Grand Trunk Road, towvards A llababad. In Bundelcumd, all around Nagode and Fort Kulinger, the country is for many miles perfectly quiet. Lieu- tenant Remington is holding the latter place with i troops of the Rajah of Punna, who has displayed great zeal and loyalty in the cause of Government. Major Ellis, the political agent of Bundelcund a'-,d Rewah, is possessed of considerable iifluence am'jna the various Rajahs in the provinces, and it is per' p owing to his good judgment that most of thera have remamed loyal; but they, nevertheless, deserve great credit. European troops have. cor.tinueed to arrive at Calcutta from Singa ore and Eongkong, nd more as a oit handg aTpe 93a oghlandero have been heard of at the Mauritius, and murt iSow be close to Calcutta. The Supreme Government had been petitioned to proclaim martial law in Bengal, but refused to do so. The Mohurrum had passed off quietly, and no disturbance had occurred during its continuance. Lord Elgin left Calcutta for China on the 3d of September, in the Peninsular and Oriental Company'r steamer Ava. Sir Patrick Grant had returned to Madras and resumed his duties in that Presidency. Lord Canning is still at the seat of Government. " In the Bombay Presidency, we have been comparatively quiet, and no fresh disturbances have occurred at any of our Mofussil stations. On the 8th of September 18 prisoners, who had beers convicted of treason, were executed at Sattara, in the presence of an immense multitude of people, who assembled from all parts to witness the spectacle. Five of the prisoners were hanged, six were blown away from guns, and seven were shot. Everything passed off quietly, and the scene mu,t have inspired the natives with a wholesome dread, which will tend to keep them in submission. Several arrests were being made in the city, but none of the people dreamt of creating a disturbance. Wherever disaffection has shown itself in Western India it has been stifled with unrelenting sternness, and the authorities deserve great credit for their conduct during the crisis, when the flames of revolt threatened to spread withir} our borders. As long as the main body of the troops continue loyal there can be nofear of the result, as weare quite able to put down the unaided efforts of the mob. Every important station, too, from Dharwar, in thesouth, toAdmedabad, in thenorth, hasbeen secured by European troops, so thatno fear can be entertained of popular outbreaks in the large towns. The Mohurrum, which has generally been a period of excitement to the Mussulman population, has passed off quietly throughout the Presidency, owing to the admirable arrangements of the Executive for preserving the public peace. Her Majesty's 89th Regiment arrived in Bombay from the Cape on the 11th of September, and have been despatched to Ahmedabad and Deesa. Other regiments are aL,o soon expected, so that we may consider that aU danger is past, and that we shaU shortly re-establish our power throughout the country. The weather in Bombay has continued to improve, and we now enjoy a mild temperature, havig alternate rain and sunshine during the day. The fall of rain on the island is nearly 70 inches. The Governor and Commander-mn-Chief are both at the Presidency, to which the latter returned a few days ago." THE CALCUTTA MAIL. We take the following summary from the Renga Hurkaru of the 9th of September:- "Seventeen days have glided by since the last mail left Calcutta, and if we have no great successes to record, there are at least no fresh massacres to lament. So far as we know Delhi has not yet been taken, and, certainly, Lucknow is yet unrelieved. Agra still holds out, and, thanks to the fidelity of Scindia, it is not threatened; and though the atmosphere seems charged with thunder the storm has not brokeni out afresh duling the last fortnight in any part of the disturbed districts. " When the last mail left we were entering upon the Mohurrum-that season during which the Mahomedans often work themselves up into ungovernable fury. Thanks to the precautions forced upon the Government the dreaded week has tided over without the smallest attempt at disturbance or insurrection. Meanwhile every eye has been turned upon Lucknow and our heroic countrymen there who have so long defended their position against enormous odds. Their fate has been trembling in the balance. On the 10th of July last intimation was conveyed to Government that their provisions were sufficient to support them for six weeks. This brought them up to the 22d of August. That day, however, approached, and there were no signs of relief. But General Havelock, though he failed in his attempt about that time to relieve Lucknow, so far succeeded that he drew the besiegers upon his small force. This enabled the beleaguered garrison to make a saLy, which was not only successful asto the destructionof the enemy, but enabled them to bring in a further amount of bullocks -sufficient foraboutthreeweeks' consumption. It was then calculated that they could holdout up to the 9th or 10th of September; and it was hoped that reinforcements, consisting of the 5th Fusileers and 90th Foot, would reach Cawnpore at the latest on Septemberl, and thus easily enable General Havelockto effect the relief of the garrison before the 9th. There is, however an old adage that too many cooks spoil the broth. Air Colin Campbell had not been allowed at that time to take his seat in council, and he therefore could exercise no effectual control over the movements of the trcops. General Outram and the officers commanding at Dinaporo and Benares had all fingers in the pie, and the result was that the two regiments on reaching Mirzapore were called back to Din apore and then sent on again in the Mirzapore and Allaabad direction. It is but fair to General Outram to add that letters recently received assert that the recall was in no way his deed, and that he disapproved it I from the first. Be that as it may, the subjecti s one which demands a searching inquiry, and the possession of high office either in the civil or in the military department should not be allowed to screen the culprit. A delay of ten days was by this mismanagement caused at a most critical period, and, but for the marked intervention of l'rovidence, must have proved fatal to our countrymen at Lucknow. Happily, however, another opportunity presented itself for making a sortie. This time It was attended with greater success than ever. More than 100 of the enemy wvere blown into the air by a mine; a 24-pounder gun which had greatly annoyed them was spiked, and large supplies of provisions were secured. The garrison now consists of about 500 men, of whom 150 are in hospital; there are also about 300 women and children, who have gone through all the I dangers and hardships of the siege, certain (for the fate of the Cawnpore garrison had reached them) of a crnel death if compelled by famine or any other cause to surrender. We may IIow almost look upon their relief as secure; humanly speakiDg it is quite so. General Outram, with 1,300 mnen of the 5th Fusileers and 70th,was at Allahabad on the 1st inst. They were expected at Cawnpore on the 11th; there they would find General Havelock with 1,100 men and 20 guns, some of them of large calibre ; and a strong conviction was felt that such a force, urged on with determination, would be sufficient to overcome the opposition, great as it was likely to be, waiting for it on the Lucknow-road. " From Delhi we receive cheering intelligence. The insurgents had commenced fighting among themselves, and the King had transmitted a secret message to Mr. Colvin, offering to give in provided be was replaced in the position he occupied befora the revolt. It is to be hoped that this offer was rtjected with scorn. Our army occupied an unassailable position before Delhi, and had been largely reinforced by the moveable column, consis.- ing of Her MIajesty's 52d and a wing of the Gist, with some Sikh corps, under Brigadier General Nicholson, a young soldier, but one marked out for distinction. Shortly after his arrival in camp the Kl!Neemuch and Bareilly mutineers made a strong effort to attack our forces in rear. General Nicholson was sent out against them with his division, and completely defeated them, capturing 12 pieces. It is believed that the final assault on the imperial city will not be mulch longer delayed. Sir Colin Campbell, it is rumoureci, has sent up orders to make short work of it, and General Wilson is not the man to retard the execuition of such an order a single hour. " The proviice of Behar, and the districts around the cities of Benares, Patna, anc 3irzapore are st;lU inan unsettled state,but in all of them the Mohurrum passed without any decided moanifestation of insirrection. At Benares, indeed, an impregnable fortress has been erected near Pnj Ghat en the bank of the river, commanding $he whole eity, so that the smallest demonstratim could be moat effectually gelled. That city is therefoe safe. Patnah, too, haws continued quiet. That it has remained so is due entirely to the exertions of Mr. William Tayler, who everawed the nat-ves by a. judicious course of severity. "Sir Copin l Cam l, it is believed, will leave for the NorthAVest in about a month, and, taking up Havelock&s force, -will open direct communications with Delhi. There are several first-rate officers in Calcutta waiting for emiploy, who will be glad to accompany hiim. " The past fortnight has been one of almost unequalled pressure in the money- market, the Bank of Bengal hahiug ref used to discount Court of Directors' biliu with mere than 00 days to run, or ta nul~a and enew lans Uipon Goverinment papes 4w Val QvtbQ baeks. The immediate cause of these steps is believed to be the crippled position the Bank directors. find themselves in by having advanced to a large extent upon Company's paper witbout reserving a sufficient margin to speculators and others who have left the Bank in the lurch with the papers not being able to take up the loans or to pay the difference between what it is really worth and the amount advanced upon it by the Bank. WVe leave our readers to judge of the wisdom and ability which governs the Bank of Bengal, and which has produced such a state of things. We have since heard that two of our local banks,which held a large amount of Court of Directors' bills, finding them iaconvertible into cash, applied to the Government to pay them under discount, which has been granted under the special circumstances, and will no doabt afford some relief to the fair trading public, whose interests have been so ruthlessly sacrificed by the directors of the Bank of Bengal to the speculators and jobbers in Company's paper. " Exchange opened at 2s. 2§d. for first class six months' sight bills, and, in consequence of the pressure in the money-market advanced to 2s. 31d., but closes a trifle easier." The Calcutta BEnglishman of the 9th of September makes the following somewhat gloomy observations:- "We yesterday published news from Delhi to the 26th of August, by which it wiU be seen that Delhi still holds out, and that no positive date can yet be fLxed for its reduction. With reaard to other districts, so far from peace and good order being re-established, disorder and rebellion have extended to provinces which in June were perfectly tranquiL The greater part of Behar and the south-western frontier of Bengal are in confusion, and the important district of Goruckpore has been abandoned by the order of this Government. The garrison of Lucknow has not been relieved, and it apDears unlikely that our troops can reach it before the end of this month. The mutineers and insurgents, though contemptible in the field, are so numerous as to throw great difficulties in the way of an advancing force, and the season in which every stream is overflowing aud the country almost impassable is an additional obstacle to military operations. At this season, too, the exposure of a campaign inevitably produces much sickness, and our European soldiers have suffered severely from it. We expect some reinforcements duriDg the present month, and by the end of October we may reasonably hoDe for the arrival of a force sufficient to put down rebelllon in these provinces. Its fate in Upper India must be decided by troops sent up the Indus and the Punjab levies. Order and obedience may then indeed be restored, and an entire new system adopted, whether military or civil. It is too soon to speculate upon the course that ought to be or will be pursued; at present it is sufficient to record events which follow in such rapid succession, and which must ultimately determine the measures to be adopted. " We observe that the home authorities boast of the slight depreciation which the rebellion has caused in Government securities. In the revolted districts Company's paper for the last three months has been sold at 50 to 85 per cent. discount ! This, however, affords no criterion of public opinion, as much so offered may either have been plundered from its rightful owners or been the property of those in open rebellion, to whom it was valueless. But here at the seat of Government and the centre of money transactions the fall has been steady and considerable. Five per cent. paper has been sold at 12, and four per cent. paper at 24 per cent. discount, and no considerable sum could be disposed of even at a much lower rate. " The Bank of Bengal last week issued a circular to the other local banks, announcing that the directors have resolved upon declining to make any loans or opening cash credits on deposit of Company's paper, and that all applications for renewal of existing loans or cash credits must be submitted for the special consideration of the directors. " This measure, at a moment when the approaching Doorgah Poojah holydays naturally create an increased call for accommodation, wiiU be productive of serious inconvenience, and may be attended with disastrous consequences to the mercantile community and to trade in general. " The Bank of Bengal ought to have drawn in its horns the day after the news of the Delhi massacre arrived. But the Government directors have acted like inexperienced navigators, who truist they can carry sail through what they deem and assert to be a mere passing squall, while more experienced seamen have already made all snug in expectation of the coming hurricane." MA-DRAS. We have received files of the Madras Athei.Tyum to the 12th of September inclusive. The Madras Presidency was perfectly tranquiL .4; DELHI. (From the Bom&ay Timnes.) LA.ORE, Aug. 25.-From the Camp beforeDelhi, 4 p.m., August 23.-" Nothing of moment to-day. The mutineers still fire at intervals from gans from the opposite bank of the Jumna, bet have done no harm." The auxiliary force (Consisting of about 3,000 men of all arms, with a battery of six guns) furnished by his Highness the Maharajah Rhumbeer Singh of Jummoo and Cashmere, was reviewed by the Chief Commisaioner at Jullandur yesterday morning. They were in good heart and are a fine body of men. They were to resume their march towards Delhi last night. A letter from Hansl reports that the affair with the insurgents at Hissar (which was noticed in the public papers f yesterday) was most satisfactory, about 350 of them having been killed. Lieutenant Boileau, who had received a severe sword cut, was doing well. Therevenue collections in Hurreeanah are progressing favourably, and it only remained to reduce the refractory village of Jumalpore to restore quiet to the district. All quiet in the Panjab, LAHOP.E, Aug. 26.-From Delhi, 4 p.m., Aug. 24.- "Nothing of moment to report from this. Lieutenant Hodson has returned to camp with his party. Altogether he has kiUled upwards of 80 insurgents, chiefly furlough men. All well at Agra on the 20th, and a party preparing to start to Hattrass to disperse an insurgent gathering.' There is nothing farther to commuanicate from any quarter. LAHORX, Aug. 27.-The following is from Delhi,received yesterday:-"4 p.m. Aug. 25.-A force of the enemy having been reported to have moved to Nuzuffghur, Brigadier-General Nicholson marched this evening to endeavour to bring them to action with about 2,000 men and 16 guns. He had got over the moat part of the ground by noon when our last accounts left, but had not reached the mutineers. We have had heavy rain."} "9 a.m., Aug. 26.-Brigadler-General Nicholson attacked the force of the enemy that had moved to Nuzuffghur yesterday evening and completely routed them, and captured al their gutns, 12 in number. OaLr loss small, but Lieutenant Lumsden, of Coke's corps, one of the very best officers In the army, was unfortunately killed." Mr. Riieketts, Deputy Commissioner of Loodianah, reports the capture by his police of eight men and five horses of the 10th Light Cavalry; also that three more men were being brought in. They have all been ordered to be hanged. LAoxRE, Aug. 2S.-Prom Delhi, 4 p.m., Aug. 26.- "General Nicholson's force will be back this evening. He captured in all 13 guns, besides the enemy's camp baggage. Oar loss was about six killed aud wounded, besides Lieutenant Lumeden, who was killed. Dr. Ireland, of the Artillery, was dangerously (it was feared mortally) wounded, and Lieutenant Gabbett, 61st Foot, wounded. The fugitives having returned to Delhi an attack was commenced on onr position at 10 a.m. to-day. The mutineers same out in great force, apparently believing that we had but fevr troops left in camp. They have made no impression whatever on us, and have cansed very few easalties." Major Becher, commanding in aazara, reports, on the 25th inst, that another party of 43 men (including two native officers) of the 55th Regiment Native Infantry,which had reached the COshmere border, had been forwarded to him by order of his Highness Maharajah Ilhumbeer Singh, by the road of Mozuffeabad, whlch is a canton ment of the Cashmere Government, near the Hasara border. The mutineers were tried by military commission, and 21 had been executed that morning at Abbottabbad, and the remainder were to be executed in the evening at Etnrreepore. Major Becherhad written to thank thea Maharajah for this proof of his vigilance and interest irx our cause. A report from Lleutenant Mildmay, Assistant Politica'l Agent, on 'deputation with a force of his Highness +:ne Maharajah of Bikaneer, has been received, of the s4tion fought at Hiasar on the 19th inst. An insurgent f.orce of upwards oi 2,000 nmen, horse and foot, under Alahomed Azeem, atteupted to surprise the gates of ';ce town of Hissar about half-past 10 a.m. A timely -i'.arm was however given, an,d Leutenant Mildmey and ois officers immediSs,ely arranged his smalU forcps to re.i,el the attack. His force consisted of a company of tfjo Sd Punjab Police BAt. talion, "lut4ar ookh;es,," IQQ of the Punjab mounted pollee from Googarla, and About 500 horsemen, und-r MullucC Fatteh Shere Khan Tawanah, ,orfuraz Khose, Esau Kharie and Kumal Ooddeen Kassooree, .Wlth a portion of the Bikareer body-guard. The assailants we-e not only repulsed, but pursued and totally routed, leaving 300 dead bodies on the ground. Lioutensht Boileau, of thy 16th Grenadiers, .attached to Rajah Jowahir Slngh's trL*ps secelved a severe aword cut when gallantly leading a paffy of the hornemen to the charge. Our other oasualtief an;ounted to IS men wounded. Lieutenant Mildmlay makes prrtlunlar rmention of the servicew rendered by Lieutenants Bunt and Boileau, who aided him greatly in arranging for the safety of the town and leading on the attack of the enemy. To the services rendered by Mr. Taylor, Superintendent of Government farms, who first gave the alarm on the approach of the insurgents, and subsequently charged with the Tawanah Horse, Lieutenant Mild. may expresses himself mnuch indebted. He also bears ttestimony to the gallantry of Mr. Jackson ( a volunteer attached to General Van Courtlandt's force), who accom. psnied the Knttar Mookhee Company in dislodging a body of the insurgents from a strong position they had occupied. The native chiefs are aU reported to have conducted them. stIves admirably. LAHORE, Aug. 29.-Authentic intelligence has been re. c- ived of the complete evacuation of Herat by the Persian troops on the 27th of July. The following is from Delhi:-` 4 p.m., Aug. 27.- The total loss in General Nicholson's Brigade on the 26th is 17 killed and wounded, including Lieutenant Lumsden killed, and Lieutenant Gabbett, 61st Foot, who died of his wounds. Lieutenant }Elkington, 61st, and Dr. Ireland both dangerously wounded. The gnns captured are one 24Sounder howitzer, two 12-pounder howitzers, two 9-pounder guns, four 6-pounder guns, and four 3-pounder brats guns of native manufacture. We have now secured all the guns of Mackenzie's troop, and Captains Kirby and De Tessier's batteries. The attack on our position yesterday ceased in the e+ening. Our loss yesterday was eight killed and 12 woounded. The enemy suffered to a much greater extent. 37 dead soldiers being counted in one place. Their cavalry was weU punished with the grape from the heavy guns in our centre battery. AU well-at Agra on the 21st." It is reported that the force under Bnkht Khan, which was routed by Genersal Nicholson at Nuzuffghur, was evL dently bent on intercepting the siege train by a flank march on Soneeput. It was composed of the 18th, 28th, 29th, 68th, and 3d Regiments Xative Infantry, tho 8th Irregular Cavalry, and detachments of the 13th and 14th, and 18 guns, with all the arms, ammunition, &c., brought from Bareilly. This force was to have been followed in a couple of days by the Neemuch brigade. It is probable, however, that a portion of the latter brigade was present at Nazuffghur, as the guns of Mackenzie's troop belonged to It. The 51st Regiment of Native Infantry broke out yesterday at Peshawar, and made an attempt to seize the arms of one of the new Sikh regiments, while the men were at dinner. The mutineers, however, were repelled with loss. They were broke and dispersed, and doubtless will be destroyed. Thirteen of the Light Cavalry mutineers were hanged at Loodianah yesterday evening, and the same nnmber of the 26th and 46th at Jullundur; the latter had been seized and sent in by the Rlajah of Chumba. Two hundred men of the 5th and 60th Native Infantry having been ordered into confinement at lJmballah attempted to escape; 100 were killed on the spot, 25 were seized, and the rest were being pursued. LAHORB, Aug. 30.-From Delhi there was nothing of moment to report up to 4 p.m. of the 28th inst. General Cotton reports from Peshawur that out of 871 of the 51st Regiment 785 are " accounted for," and that the miasing men are being brought in by twos and threes by the vilagers and police. The force beaten by General Nicholson at Nuzuffghur on the 26th appears to have been composed mainly of the Neemuch brigade, with a number of fanatics and others. The Rohilcund brigade is said to have been four coss in the rear and unable to afford support. After the action General Nicholson blew up and destroyed the bridge at Uhurkonda. The town of Pasham, in Hurreeanah, has unfortunately been sacked and plundered by Mahomed Azeem who also cut up about 50 or 60 of the Bikaneer horsemen. LAHORF., Aug. 3L-No news from Delhi, or from any otber quarter of importance. General Wilson awaits the siege train, to resume offensive operations at Delhi The insurgents appear a good deal depressed by the defeat at Nuxuffghur; our troops have also obtained very considerable plunder, as the enemy still continue their former practice of carrying their il-gotten gains about them. L,AORE, Sept. L-Up to 4 p.m., 29th of August, nothing of moment had occurred at Delhi. P.S.-The following just received from Delhl:4 p.m., 30th August. Last night, for the security of our working party, it was necessary to take some of the enemy's breastworks between our advanced pickets, the Sammy house, and the town. This was done in the most gallant style with a rush, the enemy haying about 14 killedTwo men of the 60th Rifles were killed in this attack." LAimoRB, Sept. 2.-Nothing from Delhi by telegraph since yesterday. Letters state that the mutineer force routed by General Nicholson near Nuzuffghur consisted of the Neemuch brigade and Kotah Contingent, with a large body of cavalry, including the 13th and 14th Irregulars. "AlU in camp in Delhi elated at the prospect of offensive operations against the city; considerable progress made on the night of the 29th ult. inxclearing ground to our right front. Enemy allowed a trench to be made from the advanced post on the right to the ravine, forming a natural parallel, without molestation, but now (on the 30th) they appear too late to have discovered the mischief it portends. All qaiet in Rajpootfna, and Jeypore has sent in its tribute. LAHORE, Sept. 3.-There is nothing further from Delhi, most probably owing to the heavy rain. There is a report from Delhi, that on the 31st ult., 22 ca=ts, laden with the families of the residents, had left for Rewarree, and that numbers were daily leaving the city. J. D. MACPHERSON, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Secretary to the Chief Commissioner.
CAWANPORR. (From the Poonahl Obscrrcr.) The following order was issued by General Havelock after the action at Bithoor, when the enemy were defeated for the ninth time since the commencement of the cam paign:- "FIELD FORCE 011DZR. " Cawnpore, Aug. 17. " The Brigadier-General commanding congratulates the troops on the result of their exertions In the combat of yesterday. The enemy were driven, with the loss of 250 kiled and wounded, from one of the strongest positions in India, which they obdurately defended. They were the flower of the mutinous soldiery, flushed with tho successful defection at Saugor and Fyzabad; yet they stood only one short hour against a handful of soldiers of the Stat e whose ranks had been thinned by sickness and the sword. May the hopes of treachery and rebellion be everthus blasted; and if conquest can now be achieved under the most trying circusistanceq what will be the triumph and retribution of the time whe.n the armies from China, from the Cape, and from England, shall sweep through the land? Soldiers! in that moment your labours, your privations, your sufferings, and your valour vill not be forgotten by a grateful coun.ry. You wil be acknowledged to have been the stay and prop of British India in the time of her severest trial." The following letter from a non-commissioned officer of Her Majesty's 7Sth Highlanders to a friend in Bombay has been kindly placed at our disposal:- "Allahabad, Aug. 21. "The news received from Cawnpore yesterday was anything but cheering. Our brave little force at ibha place had just fought their ninth battle, and the state of the troops was frightful; nearly all were sick, and a great many wero dying from cholera. They can scarcely muster SOO rmen, but evsn this small force, weak as they were, marched out 12s mUles from Cawnpore to dislodge the enemy, beat them, ari captured two guns; but, poor fellows, afNer this achievemsent they were so dons up that they could not march back to Cawnpore, buS had to hLalt till evening ere they could accomplish it, and. aven then a number died on the way. Thsy are now, paor fellows, looking at each other, wondering who is to,be the next victim of disease. They are waiting in Luckr,w for reinforcements, and I think they will have to wait rome time, for, though troops ore arriving 12 Calcutta daily, still, as they are sent up country, maglstrates and others delay them for the better protection of the ADst tious on the river; but, unless General Havelock gets more .,roops to his assistance, I fear it will be a secona Cawnpore business. "-you are of course aware that HavelonAs column was fighting its way to assist the garrison of Lucknow. IHavelock, however, could not manage it, owving to the frightful sickness and mortality, arising from, fatigue and exposure, that prevailed among the men, and, he was obliged to retire on Cawnpore. When the enernay heard of their retiring they followed them, but to show them that our troops were not dispirited Hav,alook again met them, and gavo them another b;heting. In this afair the 78th Bighlanders, about 150 strong, were in advance, the 1st MSadras Fq;leets= ,aysg boen sent to the right. Our men were under a most galling fire, e very shot earrying off somo of them; they got the wurd to c'.Trge, and on they went like tigers, putting 7,000 to flight AT, d capturing.two guns, The General galloped up and pai' them a wellmerited complimesit; they then gave the Gs neral thrre cheers, but he roared out, I Highlandra, don't cheer rue, you have done it all yourselves ; I had nothing to do with it.' e then gave out asn order, that if any person knew Wbo was the first man of the 78th in the enemy's batiteries Ih tell him, and he would recommend him for the Vitotria Cross., TH1i GAWNPORE AMASSACRES. TlA# following is an account of the defence and massacrvn at Cawnpore by Lieutenant Delafoese, one of the aurvivore :; " Son, tiLme before any disturbance broke out at Carnpore, and it was only expocted that there might be an oPtbreak among the troops, Geer ual Wheeler ordered over-from Oude a regiment of lregular Caralry, which was quartered in different parts of the cantonnients. At the same tilme officer were ordered'to s0eep in the lineg with their aex ; and assistance was- asked from- thc Rajah of Dithoor, the Nena, who sent seome 200 cvalFy, 42O infautry, and two, guns, which force ad'the guarding of the Treasury. A few days later the Oude rrregulars were ordered out of ther station, as the Genciatrfound be could not trust them, and were 'elieved by a eompany of the 32d Regiment froJn Lucknow. General. h'eeler gave the order tor all-the European inhabitants to sleep near the 32d Regiment'& barracks, also for the Artillery to be ready to move dowa at any moment. On the 2d of June two companies of the 84th Pegiment arrived from Allahabad; but on the morning of the 3d General Wheeler gave orders for one companyr of the 84th, made up to its faU strength, together with the company of the 32d Regiment, to march to Lucknow, so that we had left at Cawupore 60} men of the atth Regiment, 70' of the 32d, 15 of the 1st Madras Fusileers, and a few men of the Artillery with six guns. " On the morning of the 4th of .Jane the ofceors of the cavalry, the 1st and 56th Regiments, were ordered to dis. continue sleeping in their lines; but the 53d Native Infantry being consiaered loyal the oMicers of that corps wele still to be with their men. Ga the afternoon of the Sunday Lieutenant A,she arrived with half a battery of Oude Horse Artilery, two 9-pounders and a 24-pounder, having been obliged to retire on Cawnpore, as the troops that were with him on his way to Fattyghur had mutinied on the road on the 5th of June. The trenches being finished the guns were placed in, and provisions for about 25 days were ordered in them. At about 11 o'clock that night the cavalry rose, taking with them their arms and two horses each. Early next morning the 1st Regiment Native Infantry was reported to have gone. The 53d appeared. stiU loyal, remaining in their lines; but as none of the officers were with their men, and as there was no one to look after them, they also went off, without any one missing them, between 8 and 9 o'clock, taking vith them theregimental treasure and colours, and as much ammunition as they could carry. That afternoon every house was burnt, fires were seen in every direction; we could do nothing but stay where we were, being too few in number to meet the rebels, as all the Golundazer, belonging to the artillery had gone away soon after Lieatenant Ashe's arrival, and volunteers for the artiUlery were called in from the infantry, Next morning, the 7th of June, a letter was received from the Rajah of Bithoor, who was supposed to be on our side, saying he meant to attack us. Soon after two guns opened upon us from the northwest, and musketry from all directions. On the 8th three more guns were brought against us. The number of guns against us increased daily, and on the 11th the enemy had playing upon us night and day three mortars, two 24 pounders, three 18-pounders, one or two 12-pounders, about the same number of 9-pounders and one G-poUnder. On or about the 12th of June the insurgents by firing set on fire the large barracks in which all the women of the 52d Regiment and the wounded were placed. No sooner was the fire perceived than the 'assembly' was sounded, and every man had to stand to his post, as we expected to be attacked. There was no place for the women and children to go to but the trenches, where many of them had to remain night and day. There was no shelter now for the men anywhere during the day, and from this date we lost five or six men daily by sunstroke. On the - of June, after having been on half rations for some days, the Rajah sent a halfcaste woman with a note into the trenches, to the effect that all soldiers and Europreus who had nothing to do with Lord Dalhousie's government, and would lay down their arms, should be sent to Allahabad. General Wheeler gave orders to Captain Moore to act as he should con sider best. Captain. Moore that eveningsigned a treaty to the effect that the Rajah should provide boats and carriage for the wou nded and ladies down to the river bank, while on oar side we were to give up what treasure we had, together with arms an d ammunition. On the26th acommittee of officerswent to the xiver toseethat the boats were ready and serviceable; and everything being reported ready, and carriage for the wounded having arrived, we gave over our guns, &a., and marched ont on the morning of the 27th of Jane, about 7 o'dock. WYe got down to the river and into the boats without being molested jn the least; but no sooner were we in the boats, and had laid down our muskets, and had tsken off our coats to work easier at the boats, than the cavalry gave the order to fire. Two guns that had been hidden were run out and opened on us immediately, while Sepoys came from all directions and kept up a fire. The nien jumped out of the boats, and indsead of trying to get the boats loose from their moorings swam to the first boat they sa w loose. Only three boats got safe over to the opposite side of the river, but were met there by two fieldpieces, guarded by a number of cavalry and infantry. Before these boats hbd got a mile down the stream half our smaU party were either killed or wounded and two of our boats had been swamped. We had now only one boat, crowded with wounaded and having on board more than she could catry. The two giuns foUowed us the whole of the d.y, the infantry firing on us the whole of that night, On the second day a gun was seen on the Cawnpore aide, and opened on us at Nuzuffghur, the infantry stil following us on both sides. On the morning of he third day the boat was no longer serviceable. We were aground on a sandbank, and had not strength sufficient to move her. Directly any of us got into the water we were fired upon by 30 or 40 men at a time. There wva nothing left but to charge and drive them away. So 14 of us were told to go and do what we could. Directly we got on shore the insurgents retired, but having followed them up too far, we were cut off from the river, and had to retire ourselves, as we were being surrounded. We could not make for the river, but had to go down parallel, and came at the river againr a mile lower down, where we saw a large foroe of seen right in front waiting for us, and another lot on the other bank, should we at tempt to cross the river. On the bank of the river, just by the force in front, was a temple. We fired a voUey and made for the temple, in which we took shelter, one man being killed and one wounded. From the door of the temple we fired on every insurgent who showed himself. inding that they could do nothing against us while vwe remained inside, they heaped wood all romnd and set it on fire. When re could no longer remain inside on account of the smoke and heat we threw off the clothes we bad, and each taking a musket charged through the fire. Seven of us out of twelve got into the water, but before we had gone fAr two poor fellows were shot. There were only fire left now and we had t° swim, while the insrrgents followed us along both banks, wading and firing as fast as they oould. After re had gone about three miles down thestream, one of our party, an artilleryman, to rest himself, began swimming on his back, and not knowing in what direction he was swimming got on shore and was kiUed. When we had gone dowz about six miles firing on both s'ides cesed, ana soon after we were hailed by some natives oG the Oude side, who. asked us to come on shore, and said that they would take us to their Rasah, who was friendly to the English. Wegave onrselves up. and were taken. sis miles inland to the. Rajah, who treated us very kindly, giving us clothos and food. We stayed with him for about a month, as he would not let us leave,. saying the roads wlere unsafe. At hlst he sent us off on the 29tla of July o the- right bank of the riverto a zemindsz of a village, who gob us a hackery. Wo toolk our departure on the 3iht of July for Allahabad, but met the detachment of the 8.4th Regimer,t under Linutenant Woodhouse before we- had gone 10 miles; and erchod o£with him to CawApore.

Our local joint-stock shares keep remarkably firm, at nearly former quotations. IM?PORTSR. Cotton Piece Goods.The imprvemnent in the tone of the market noticed in our last hTas continued to progress, and,the rates for most of the articles have advanced. The speculators have come forward with energy, and the buluness transacted during the fortnight has been to a fair extent. Gray shirtings T-cloths, and gray Madapollams have exhibited a slight advance In price. Gray dormetics have been in moderate inquiry ; gray longeloths are iv. demand. Bleached and Fancy Goods.-Bleacbed jacoiCts, lOW, mre in fair inquiry; but bleached shirtings and hladapollams are dull of sale.

On the 30th ult. the Peninsalar and Oriental Company's steamship Hindostan arrived here, bring.ng London advices to the 26th of July last. The commercial inteUligence is not of a nature to cause improvenment in our trade, whioh has continued to suffer from the effectaof the great crisis through which this country is now passing. Although the state of affairs in the U pper Provinces and in the province of Behar may be said to be a little more favourable than at the date of our last issue, giving hopes of tlh- restoration of order and tranquillity ns soon as the arri-.I ' ,ufficient reinforce. mentsil have enabled our Government to proceed with vigour in suppressing the rebellion throughout the country - yet our markets in general have continued in the same depressed state as for some time past, and in some instances operations have been even on a smaller scale, much inconvenienoe and embarrassment being felt from the increasing tlmhtnees of our money-market. y the Fiery Cross we have been in receipt of advices from Hongkong to the 14th nit. Beyond the blockading of the Canton river by the English Admiral nothing of consequence had occurred there. Oplum had advanced, and last quotations were $592 for Patna, $585 to $590 for Benares, and $605 to $610 for Malwa. Bengal cotton $12 to $13, and Bombay $13 to $14 per picuL Rice had Improved, and Bengal was worth $2-SOto $3. Saltpetre, $9-j to $11d; coppr ^ssh, $15t to $16; cassln, $24 to $25. Exchange I on London I. d., and on Calcutta 224*r. to 225r. per $100. The position of our produce-market, if anything, Is worse at the present moment than at the date of our lat advices, the limited demand existing for all staple articles having been further checked bh the rise in exchange, owing to the scarcity of money. The business done during the past fortnl5ht for Great Britain has been on a small scale. The only article of export from Calcutta which has fluctuated considerably has been opium, the 9th sale, which took place on the 4th Inst., hanvng ruled very high and realzed company's rupees 49,46,775. Our prospects of the indigo crop remain almost unaltered. Transations In silk have been on a reduced scale In consequence of the Inferior quality of the late arrals and the advance in the rates of exchange, and prices have assumed a downward tendency, but the bad quality of the parcels in the market makes up for the differenco in the value, In silk piece goods nothing whatever has been done, buyers evidently keeping back in expectation of further concessions. Suar has attracted some notice for the foreign and colonial market, but scarcely anything doing for Great Britain. Saltpetore has advanood in value in consequence of short supplies. Jute continues in favour, but no change in prices. Linseed in good demand for the United States, but scarcely inquired for for Great Britain. The market for rape, poppy, and teel seeds well We arc still without any actual demand for imports for the Upper Provinces, as, besides the disturbed state of the country, the want of steam tonnage (all the steamers of private companies having been engaged by Government) renders it utterly impossible for dealers to enter into operations. In British piece goods operations continue on a moderate scale, although of late, owing to the approach of the annual Doorga Poojah holydays, larger sales of gray shirtings and jaconots have been made for lower Bengal as well as for local consumption at slightly advanced prices. Mule twist has also been in better request, and the last rise in prices well supported. Stocks, however, of all descriptions of piece goods have been on the increase, and we do not expect anything like a satisfactory business can be done for some time to come, espeCially, as money is getting gradually more and more scarce.e e,n Since our last report we have experienced increased tighthnass, and the refusal of the Bank of Bengal to advance further loans on deposit of Government securities, except to approved oustomers, and that, too, not to a large extent, has caused much embarrassment in commercil quarters. It is evident the bank has been forced to adopt such a course, the state of its finances and the gradual reduction of the amount of cash not permitting indiscriminate advances. Bow long matters are to contlnue in their present stato it is difficult to foresee. We mniht be In a more unfavourable position a short time hence, tlhough, if as it is expected, a large influx of sliver were to take place from Europe, the market would be much relieved. We publish below the statement of liabilities and assets of the Bank of Bengal for the week ending on the 2d hist showing the following result as compared with the weekily statement inserted in our last number :-Increase of loans on deposit of securities from Rs. 1,86,84,379-5-5 to Rs. 2,01,39,25 ; ditto of accounts of oredits on ditto Rs. 34,37,414-12-U to Rs. 36,63,846-3-11 ; ditto of Government bills discounted from Es 1,02,989.12-11 to Rs. 6,95,646-8-2; ditto of mint certificates ditto, Rs 186,661-1-11 to Rs. 8,75,133.7-7; decrease of cash from Rs. 92,44,477-13-7 to Rs. 77,12,305-4-2 against Company's Rs. 1,72,59,714-8.3 in September last year.

Joint-Stock Sharea.-The market is without animation and Bengal Bank shares are to be had at Rs.2,000 premium, which rate, however, is an under valuo with reference to other scrip and dividends paid thereon in comparison with those paid on Bengal Bank shares. India General Steam shares are at 150 rupees premium, and the profits of this company for the past half-year are very large. Ganges shares are at par to 100 rupees discount. In Bengal Coal shares tnere is little doing, but this company is now raising very large quantities of coal, and as soon as the moneymarket assumes a more steady aspeot they are likely to improve on our present quotation of 175 to 200 por share premium. The East India Coal Company have, we hear, a contract from Govemnment for a considerable supply. We have no transaction In scrip to report. Dock and Assam shares maintain their value. Steam Tugs are at par to 50 per discount. Gas Company's shares at par, and Bonded Warehouse shares up to 340 rupees. Government Securities.-We regret to observe that the increased tightness of the money-market and the refusal of the Bank of Bengal to grant accommodation on deposit of Government securities unless the parties be approved by the directors, have combined to depreciate further the value of all securities. Thore are very few purchasers in the market, and as no large sales can be effected under the enisting circumstances, unless at a heavy sacrmifice, holders are prevented from offering freely, and this has helped to check a greater fall in the rates. On the whole, the position of this market could not have been more unsatisfactory, and it is difficult to foresee what changes will take place in future. We quote Four per Cents. at 25r., and Five per Cents. at hlr. to 12r. ,er cent. discount. Nothing doing in Four-and-a-Half per nts. and Three-and-adEh per Cents., which commaud a nominal value. 13xehmge.-On London.-The market for the mail opened at 2s. 2id. to 23. 2hd. for American and other firstclass credits; some bank biDswere also sold at the same fiure, when the rate advanced rapidly to 2s. 3d., and ilatterly 2s. 3id, which is to-day's quotation for first-class six months' sight paper, and even at this high figure it would be difficult to place a large amount, owing to the scarcity of money. Document bills bave been sold at about td. to j. oer credit rates. On CbinA.-Sorne transactions toek place at 215r. for $100. but owing to the limited demsand for bill8 the rate declined to 210r., at which about the last transaction took place. Freights-The limited demand for tonnage to Burope and, the arrival of numerous vessels during the past fortnight | have had a depressing effect on the market, and lower rates have ruled for Gret Britain. At the present moment the average rate for London is 31. 10s. for a general cargo, of which one third to consist of seeds; and for Liverpool, 21. 17s. 6d. to 31. We have not heard of any charters for Australia, West Indies, or the Continent. Considerable engagements of grain have taken place for Mlauritits at r.1 8 to r.1 10 a bag, but the demand has evidentlT been satisfied. Soon after the receipt of advices from China by the Fiery Cross, tbree ships were talcen up for that country for the conveyance of rice at $1 a bag, but engagements have since taken place at 95 cents a bag. We h%ve hardly any change to notice for other places. EXPORTS FROM CALCUTTA. Indigo.-The manufacturing is drawing to a close with less favourable results than at first anticipated. It is now evi. dent that the produce of this year will faU short of last season's crop. Exports from 1st November, 1856. to 4th Sep. temler, 1857:-To Great Britain, 14,724 chests, 58,740 maunds; to Franoe, 7,046 chests, 25,792 maunds; to North America, 1,907 chests, 7,044 maunds, toHambnrg, 207chests, 810 maunds; to Suez and Mediterranean, 605 chests, 1,951 maund3; to Red Sea, Bombay, and Persian Galf, 1,858 chests, 6,819 maunds; total, 26,347 chests, 101,156 maunds. Sugar.-We have been without any transactions for the British markets. A few parcels are purchased now and then for Bombay and the United States. Our quotations we nominaly the same as at the date of our last, although It would be difficult to place any large quantity at a rupee per maund under. Exports in August, 1857, to Great Britain, 7,047 maunds; from 1st to 4th September, 157, 3,125 maunds. Saltpetre,-The market has been rising rapidly ad prlces ae considerably higher alnee our last. The demand is moderate, but our stock aio is very small and supplies expected to be short for some timn. There wllU be but moderate exports to Great Britain this month. Last sales of 5 per cent, refraction rs. 14 per maund, but we have no seUers now even at this high figuro. Exports in August to Great Britain, 25,989 maunds; to North AmerIca, 19,084 maunds; to Cbhina, 101 maunds.

Opium.-Previous to the arrival of tho stoamerFiery Cross with advices from Eongkong to the 15th ulL, our markot had been gradually on tho advance. On receipt of letters by her, prices receded to 1,290r. for Patna, but im. mediately after a reaction took plae, rnd, a general impression prevailing among native dealers that in consequence of the disturbed state of the Patna and Benares distriots, the cultivation of the poppy would be considerably checked, it not abandoned altogether for the present, the drug gra dually rose untU the 9th sale, which took place on the 4th inst. Patna was quoted at 1,365r. The sale ruled mnuch nIgner than had been anticlpated, as wil appear from the particulars inserted below. Subsequent to the sale, the drug again oommenced declining, and in consequence of the extreme tightness of the 7uoney-market and the difficulty of obtaining accommodation, even on unexceptional seourities, and of discounting Government acceptances, the market at onoe gave way. This, combined with the eagernas displayed by several parties (who had been hurried into purchases) to sell off, caused a considerable decline, and Patns sold as low asi,260r. Our quotations now are l,270r. to 1,272r., but itmis apprehended these figures cannot bemaintained under existing circumstances, especially if the advices now hourly looked for by the Lightning from China prove unfavourable.

BtRsTrNm oF THE RIVrwc.Tox W.ATEB PIPES. -Considerable alarm was created among the people residing in the neighbourhood of the valley lying be tween Cowley-hill and Denton's-green on Friday night last by the sudden bursting of one of the huge Risington water pipes, by which Liverpool is supplied. All the small brooks, ponds, and ditches in the neighbourhood were soon overflowing, and in two hours there was an extknsive river of about 200 yards wide, covering Potato, pasture, end stubble land, aud renehing past Dentons -groeu. lane to the brook, upwrards of half a mile. Mir. Clarke, of St. Hlelen's, at once proceeded to the hydrant at Moss.bank) and there stopped tbe progress of the water; h ut for soms time *fter the stream continued to rush out, as tho breaeh was made near the centre of a valley some two or thlie miles long, and it did not subside until Saturday evening. Some idea of the force may be imagined when It is known that the pipe burst underneath, and the water threw up the earth, sand, and woil, and carried It away, leavIng a hole ot 11 feet 6 inches deep and 48 feet by 36 eet 9inches wide.

THE INDIAN MUTINIES. (From the Supplement of the London GazetU of Frl'ay, October 9. iNDIA BOARD, OCTOBER. 1857. The foUowing despatches have been at various times received at the East India House, and are now inserted in the Lmdondt G(cett,, althouvh previous publication has not taken place in India:- No. 21. TIIE DEPUTY ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF TIIE AR5%Y TO TII SECRETARY TO THIE GuVEI.NMENT OF INDIA. Calcutta, July 18. Sir,-I have the honour, by desire of the Cocmmander-in. Chief, to transmit, in original, a desoatch under date the 12th inst., from Brigadier-General H. Havelock, C.B., commanding the moveable colutun frow Allahabad, giving a detailed account of the operations of the troops under his command, and of those under Major Renaud, of the 1st 3Madras Fusileers, and of the very decisive action fought by the combined force at Fattehpore on the above date, which has ended in the complete discomfiture of the enemy. 2. In submnitting these documents to the Governor-Ge. neral in CounCil, I am instructed to say that bis Excellency feels assured that his Lordship will agree with him that the Brigadier-General and the offlcers and meu of every arm under his command have well earned the cordial thanks and acknowledgments of the Government of India for the excellent service they have rendered, and the cheerful alacrity with which they have borne their fatigue and rhe return of the documents when done with is requested.

Sir,-By telegrams and reports in various shapes the CoinImander-in.Chief has been kept informed of the operations of Major Renaud, Ist Madras Fusileers, or the Grand Tzunk Road, between the 1st and 11th inst., &b the head of a force of 400 British and 420 native troops, with two pieces of cannon. He has everywhere pacificated the country by punishing the ringleaders In mutiny and rebellion wherever they have fallen into his hands, and earned, as I venture to think, the beat thanks of his Excellency. 2. But on the 10th inst. his position became criticaL Cawnpore had suddenly fallen, by an act of treachery un. equalled In our annals, save by one fatal event beyond the Indus; and the rebel force, thus freed from occupation, had rapidly pushed down a force to the vicinity of this place, within five miles of which the Major would arrive on the morning of the 12th. He would thus be exposed to the attack of 3,500 rebels with 12 guns. 3. No time was to be lost, so on the 10th my column marched, under a frightful sun, 15 miles to Synee, and, resumning their course at 11 o'clock at night, joined Major Renaud on the road by moonlight, and with him marched to Khaga, five miles from Fucehpore, soon after dawn, and took up a position. 4, The heat was excessive, hut there were nOv on a polnt 1,400 British bayonets and eight guns, united to a small native force. The whole is detailed In the margin. e 5. Our information has been better than that of the enemy, for when Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler pushed a reconnaiance up to the town they eidentlv supposed they had only Major Renaud's gallant but small force in their front, for after firig on the Lieutenant.Colonel and his escort they insolently pushed forward two guns and a force of infant wad cavalry, cannonaded our front, and threatened ouLr fianks, 6. I wished earnestly to give our harassed soldiers rest, and so waited until this ebuUlition should expend itself, making no counter disposition beyond posting 100 Enfield Riflemen (64th) in an advanced copse. But the enemy maintained his attack with the audacity whicb his first supposition had inspired and my inertness fostered. It would have injured the nwr-ac of my troops to permit them thus to be bearded, so I determined at once to briug on an action. 7. Futtehpore constitutes a position of no small strengh. The hard, dry Grand Trunk Road subdivides it, and it is the only means of convenient access, for the plains on both sides are covered at this season by heavy lodgments of water to the depth of two, three, and four feet. It is surrounded by garden enclosures of great strength, with high walls, and has within it many houses of good masonry. In front of the swamps are hillocks, villages, and mango groves, which the enemy alread7 occupied in force. 8. I estimate his number as set forth in the margin.+ 9. I made my dispositions. The guns, now eight in number, were formed on and close to the chauss6e, in the centre, under Captain Maude, Royal Artillery, protected and aided by 100 Enfield iflemen of the 64th. The detachments of Infautry were, at the same moment, thrown into line of quarter-distance columnns, at deploying distance, and thus advanced in support, covered at discretion by Enfield skirmishers. The smal force of Volunteers and Irregular Cavalry moved forward on the llankqs, on harder ground. 10. I might say that in ten minutes the action was decided, for in that short space of time the spirit of the enemy was utterly subdued; the rifle hre reaching them at an unexpected distance, filed them with dismay, and when Captain haude was enabled to push his guns through flank. mug swramp to point-blank range, his surprisingly accurate fire demolishedt their little remainig confidence. In a moment three guns were abandoned to us on the c&Wtss&e, and the force advanced steadily, driving the enemsy before it on everv point. 11. Major Xenaud won a hillock on the right in good style, and struggled on through the inundation. The 78th, in extension, kept up his communication with the centre; the 64th gave strength to the centre and left ; on the left the 84th and Regiment of Ferozepore pressed back the enemy's right. 12. As we moved forward the enemy's guns continued to fall into our hands, and then in succession they were driven by skirmishers and columns from the garden inclosures. from a strong barricade on the road, from the town-wall, into and through, out of and beyond the town. They endeavoured to make a stand a mile in advance of it. My troops were in suoh in a state of ex.haustion that I almost despaired of driving them further. At the same time the 'nutineers of the 2d Light Cavalry made an effort to renevw the combat by charging, with some success, our Irregular Horse, whose disposition throughout the fight was, I regret to say, worse than doubtful. But again our guns and riflemen were, with great labour, pushed to the front. Their fire soon put the enemy to final and irretrievable flight, and my force took up Its present position in triumph, and parked 12 captured guns. 13. I must endeavour, in this hasty despatch, to do justice to those who led the troops to this easy victory :_ First on the list 1 mustgplace Major Renaud, whose exertions at the head of the advanced column I cannot suificiently praise. His coolness and conduct in the action are equally entitled to my highest commendation. I hope that it wil be in the power of his Excellency tho Commander-in-Chief to bring speedily to the notice of his Royal Highness the General Commanding-in-Chief the cowuage and skill of Captain Maude, Royal ArtiUery. I have seen some artillery fights in my time, but never beheld gus better served, or practice more effective, than that of my battery under this of ficer. Colonel Hamilton led his Highlanders well, and they folowed him full of spirt and devotion. I have every reason to be satisfied with tho conduct In this combat of Major Stirling at the head of the 64th; of Lieutenant Ayrton, in command of the o4th detachment ; of Captain Brasyer, Regiment of Ferozepore ; of Captain Barrow, leading the Volunteer Cavalry ; and Lieutenant Psalliser, at the head of the Irregular Horse. I have next to speak of the Staff:- Captain Beatson, Deputy Assistant-Adjutant-General, has given me entire satisfaction in the performance of his ordinary duties, and I was much gratified by his boldness and activity in the fight. Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler is indefatigable, and most intelligent in a sphere of duty entirely new to him. Captain M'Bean's commismariat arrangements, chiefly with the advanced column, have hitherto been every way successful. My orders were conve7ed in the field boldly, actively and intelligently, by my aide-de-ca-np, Lieutenant Havelock, 10th Foot, and the foUowing officers:-Lieutenant ?dorland, l1t Fusileers; Lieutenant Moorsom, 11er Majesty's 52d Light InfantrY ; Captain Sheehy, Hler Majesty's Slat Regi. ment; Captain Russell, Englneers; and Captain M'Bean 14. I enclose the lint of casualties, the lightest, I suppose, that ever accompanied the announcemem,t of such a success. 12 British soldierR were struck down by the sun, and never rose again. But our fight was fought neither with musket nor bayonet and sabre. bi t with Enfield rifles and cannon; so we took no men. The enemy's fire scarcely reached us; ours, for four hours, allowed him no repose. 15. A return of captured ordnance also accompanies this report. I have, &c., H. HA;EII.OCI;.

General Havelock has on many occasions handled his force with the ability which might have been expected from his well-won reputation as a brave, skilful, and experienced soldier, and Sir P.

Sir,-I have the satisfaction to acquaint you, for the Information of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chlief, that the troops under my command have been twice successfully engaged with the enemy to-day, and have captured four guns. 2. WhUe prosecuting my march tvowards Cawnpore it became a matter of deep interest to me to learn whether the fine bridge over the Pandoo Nuddee had been destroyed or not. The stream is not at this season fordable, and the delay in crossing by other means, or at any other point, would have been most damaging to the objects of the expedition. 3. Intelligence meanwhile came in to the effect that the village of Aeng was strongly occupied by the enemy; that he was entrenched across the road, and had two Horso Artillery guns in position. 4. I therefore reinforced the advanced guard under Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler, by attaching to him, in addition to the small body of volunteer cavalry, six guns of Captain Maude's battery and a detachment of Her Mhajesty's 64th Regiment. 5. The enemy's entrenchments were not formidable, but the country being thickly wooded, he was enabled to maintain bimself for some time against our fire, during which interval large bodies of cavalry advanced on both sank with the intention of capturing our baggage. These attacks were very persevering, and to defeat them, as I had only 20 horse, I was compelled to protect the flanks with the infantry in second line, and by artillery fire. It is gratifying to have to report that the enemy was unable to capture a single baggage animal or followver, The last attempt was dedfeaited by the baggage guards, whose fire was very 6. Soon, however, the Lieutenant-Colonel overcame all resistance, drove the enemy before him, and captured his cannon. The road was strewed for miles with abandoned tents, ammunition, and other materials of war. He reports to me, in high terms of commendation, the conduct of the troops immediately under his command, of Captain Maaude, commanding the battery, and of Lieutenant Havelock, 10th Foot, my aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant Moorsom, 52dight Infantry, whom I placed at his disposal. 7. The troops were halted for refreshment and short repose, when authentic information was received that the bridge on the Pandoo stream was not destroyed, but defended by intrenchments and two guns of garrison calibre. 8. Disposition had to be made to force the passage of the stream, Fortunately, the bridge was at a salient bend of the river in our direction. Captain Maude at once suggested to me his desire to envelope it with his artillery fire, by placing three guns on the road and three on either flank. Thewhole of the Madras Fusileers were extended as Enfield Riflemen, as being the most practised marksmen in the force. They lined the banks of the stream, and kept up a biting fire. 9. The enemy opened an effective cannonade upon our column as they advanced along the road. They therefore deployed and advanced with great steadiness in paradie order in support of the guns and riflemen. Captain Maud!s buUets soon produced an evident effect, and then the right wing of the Fusileers suddenly closing, threw themselves with rare gallantry upon the bridge, carried it, and captured both guns. These two affairs cost me 25 killed and wounded, as shown in the accompanying return. Among the latter I regret to have to particularize Major Renaud 1st Madi-s,. Fusileers, to whose gallantry and intelligence I have been under great obligations. His left thigh was broken byamusketball inthe skirmish at Aeng, but I hope, from the fortitude w,th which he endures all suffering, a favourable result. I have, &c., H.

Sir,-I have the pleasure to announce that the triumph of the Mahratta pretender Nena Sahib, adopted nephew of the late " Ex Peshws. Baiee Rlao," has been of short duration, The treacherous proceedings by which be compassed the destruction of the force under the gallant Sir Hugh Wheeler have already been reported to the Commwander-.m Chief. I have now to announce the complete discomfiture of his force under his personal command, and the capture of his cannon, followed by the re-occupation of his station, which, since the 6th of June, he has been devastating and desecrating by every form of cruelty and oppression, 2. He filled up the measure of his iniquities on the 15tb, for, on hearing that the bridge at the Pandoo Nuddee had been forced, he ordered the immediate massacre of the wives and children of our British soldiers still in his possession in this cantonment, which was carried out by his followers with every circumstance of barbarous malignity. 3. My information was in every respect good, and I ascertained that he had taken up a position at the village of Ahirwa, wvhere the Grand Trunk Road unites with that which leads direct to the military cantonment of Cawnpore. 4. His entrenchments cut and rendered impassable both roads, and his guns, seven in number (two light and five siege calibre), were disposed along his position, which consisted of a series of villages. Behind these his infantry, consisting of mutinous troops and his own armed followers, wvas dsposed for defence. It was evident that an attack in front would expose the British to a murderous fire from his heavy guns sheltered in his entrenchment. I resolved therefore to man(euvre to turn his left. My camp and baggage were accordir,gly kept back, under proper escort, at tbe village of Maharajpoor, and I halted my troops there two or three hours in mango groves to cook and gain shelter from a burning sin, 5. My column then moved off, right in front: the Fuslleers led, followed by two guns, then came the Highlanders, in rear of whom was the central battery of six guns under Captain Maude. The 64th and 84th had two guns more in their rear, and the IRegiment of Ferozepore closed the column. 6. My troops, defiling at a steady pace, soon changed direction and began to circle round the enemy's left. They were shrouded for sonie time by olumps of mango; but as soon as the enemy comiprehended the object of their march a anevident sensation v-as created in bis lines. He pushed forward on his left a large body of horse, and opened a fire of shot and shell from the whole of his guns. But he was evidently disconcerted by our advance on his flank, and anxious for his communication with Cawnpore. My troops continued their progress until his left was wholly opened to our attack, and then formed line and advanced in direct echelon of regin,ents and batteries from the right. A wing of the Fualleers agiin covered the advance extended as Riflemnen. 7. The opportunity had arrived for which I have long anxiously waited, of developing the prowess of the 78th Highlanders. Three guns of the enemy were strongly posted behind a lofty hamlet well entrenched. I directed this regiment to advance, and never have I witnessed conduct more admirable. They were led by Colonel Hamilton, and followed him with surpassing steadiness and gallantry under a heavy fire. As they approached the village they cheered and charged with the bayonet, the pipes sounding the pibroch. Need I add that the eneimy tied, the village was taken, and the guns captured. 8. On the left Major Stirling with the 64th was equaly successful against another village, and took three guns. 9. The enemyfs infantry appeared to be everywhere in full retreat, and I had ordered the fire to cease, when a reserve 24-pounder was opened on the Cawnpore.road, which caused considerable loss to my force ; and, under cover of its fire, two large bodies oi cavalry at the sarne time riding insolently over the plain, the infantry once more rallied. The beating of their large drums, and numerous mounted officers In front, announced the definitive struggle of the Nena" for his usurped domiLnion. 10. I had previously ordered my Volunteer Cavalry to adventure a charge on a more advanced part of the enemy's horse, and I have the satisfaction to report that they conducted themselves most creditably. One of their number, Mr. Carr, was killed In the charge. 11. But the final crisis approached. My Artillery cattle, wearied by the length of the marob, could not bring up the guns to my assistance; and the 1st Madras Fusileers, 64th, 84th, and 78th detachments formed in line, were exposed to a heavy fire from the 24-pounder on the road. I was resolved this state of things should not last, so calling upon my men, who were lying down in line, to leap on their feet, I directed another steady advance. It was irresistible. The enemy sent round shot into our ranks until we were within 300 yards, and then poured in grape with such precision and determination as I have seldom witnessed. But the 64th, led by Major Stirling and my aide-de-camp, who had placed himself in their front, were not to be denied. Their rear showed the ground strewed with wounded; but on they steadily and silently camne, then with a cheer charged, and captured the unwieldy trophy of their valour. 12. The enemy lost all heart, and after a hurried fire of musketry, gave way in total rout. Four of my guns came up and completed their discomfiture by a heavy cannonade - and, as it grow dark, the roofless barracks of our artillery were dimly descried in advance, and it was evident that Cawnpore was once more in our possession. 13. The points of this victory I shall have afterwards to describe. Thetroopshad been 13hours in their bivouac when a tremendous explosion shook the earth. Nena Sahib, in full retreat to Bithoor, had blowxn up the Cawnpore magazine. The first movements of the Mahratta indicated a deter- mnination to defend himself desperately. Reports from tha front assured us that he had assembled 5,000 men, and placed 45 guns In position for the defence of his stronghold ; but his followers have since despaired, and I have taken possession of Bithoor without a shot. 14. I was joined by the steamer Barramputa this morn. leg, which is now in easy communniction with me. 15. I must reiterate my obligations to the officers commanding my detachments and batteries, to Major Stephenson, Madras Fusileers; Colonel Hamilton, the leader of my Highlanders, who had his horse shot; Major Stirling, 64th, who is slightly wounded; Captain Currie, 84th, severely. I fear dangerously, wounded (since dead); Captain Maude, ArtiUery; Captain Brasyer, commanding the Regiment of Ferozepore; and Captain Barrow, commanding my smaU body of horse. Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler's zeda and gallantry have been beyond all praise. 16. It was sny desire to have offered my thanks in like terms to Captain Beatson, Deputy Assistant AdjutantGeneral- but I can now only record my opinion over his grave. He was attacked by cholera on the morning of this hght, and though he did his duty throughout it, and bivouacked with the troops, he sank in three days under the violence of his disorder. Lieutenant Moorsom, Her Majesty's Light Infantry, assisted in carrying my orders, and displayed great courage and much inteligence. I have already mentioned the conduct of my aide-de-camp in front of the 64th throughout the light; he was seen wherever danger was most pressing, and I beg specially to commend him to the protection and favour of his Excellency the Commander.in.Chief.

JUTANT-GE-NERAL OF THE Amy. Camp, Buseerut Gunge, July 29, (Extract.) I moved forward from the strong position of ldunghowar on the 19th inst., and soon became engaged with the enemy near the town of Unao. 2. It is necessary to describe the enemy's position; his right was protected by a swamp, which could neither be forced or turned; his advance was drawn up in a garder enclosure, which in this warlike district had purposely or accidentally assumed the form of a bastion. The rest of his force was posted in and behind a village, the houses of which were loopholed. The passage between the village and the large town of Unao is narrow. The town itself extended three-quarters of a mile to our right. The flooded state of the country precluded the possibility of turning in this direction. The swamp shut us on the left. Thus an attack in front became unavoidable. 3. It was commenced by the 78th Highlanders and lst Fusileers with two guns, and soon became exceedingly warm. The enemy were driven out of the bastioned enclosure, but when our troops approached the village a destructive fire was opened upon them from the loopholed houses. It became necessary to bring up the 64th under Colonel Wilson, K.H. Here some daring feats of bravery were performed. Private Patrick Cavanagh, 64th, was cut literally in pieces by the enemy, while setting an example of distfgu;b9ed gallantry. Had he lived I should have deemed him worthy of the Victoria Cross. It could never have glittered on a moze gallant breast. 4. Lieutenant Bogle, 78th Highlanders, in an attempt to penetrate into a house filled with desperate fanatics of the Mussulman faith, was badly wounded. The village was set on fire ; still its defenders resisted obstinately. Finally, the guns were capiured, and the whole force was enabled to debouch by the narrow passage between the village and the town of Unao, and formed in line. It found the enemy rallied, and re-formed in great force. Infantry, guns, and cavalr were drawn up in line on the plain. They were at. tacked in direct echelon of detachments and batteries their guns taken, and the infantry and horse put to flight. During the whole of the action a large detacbment of the troops of Nena Sahib threatened our left flank. 5. The troops halted tbree hours and then moved on towards Buseerut Gunge. It is a walled town with wet ditches. The gate is defended by a rcund tower, on and near which four pieces of cannon were mounted, the adacent building being loopholed and otherwise strengthened. inrear of the town is a broad and deep inundation, crossed by a narrow chaussce and bridge. The guns pushed on in admirable order, supported by the 1st Fusileers skirmishing and tbe 78th Highlanders and G4th Regiment in line. 6. The enemy's cannonade was well sustained ; nevertheless, our force continued to gain ground. The 64th were then directed to turn the town by our left and penetrate between it and the swamp, thus cutting off the enemy from the chauss6e and bridge. The Fusileers and the High. landers precipitated themselves on the earthworks, broke throu_gh the entrenchment, and captured the town. 7. TXhe whole of the guns of 5th company of 7th battalion Artillery were taken by us, with nearly anl its ammunition. It had come from Fyzabad and Lucknow. The ground on both sides of the road at Unao was so flooded that it was impossible for cavalry to act. Mfy volunteer horse were therefore reduced to inactivity, though most anxious to 8.gThe loss of the enemy at Unao Is estimated by native report at1, 500 killed and wounded. It might, in truth, amount to 500. It was lighter at Buseerut Gunge, in consequence of the mistake already noticed. 9. In these two combats 19 guns were captured from the enemy,. 10.-I must praise the conduct of all my staff officers. Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler, hardly able from indisposition to sit on hii horse, set throughout the day an example of darng and activity; Lieutenant Havelock, Deputy Assistant-Adjutant-General, had a horse shot under him; Lieu- tenant; Seton, my acting aide-dc-camp, was severely wounuded. MLajor Stephenson, at the bead of the Madras Fusileers, showed throulghout the day how the calmest forethought can be united with the utmost daring. 11.

Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of Govermnent, and in the absence of my commanding officer, Lieutenant WiUoughby, Artilery, supposed to be kiled on his retreat from Delhi to this statlon, the following facts as regaTds the capture of the Delhi magazine by the mutineers and insurgents on the 11th inst. :-On the morning of that date, between 7 and 8 a.m., Sir Theophilus hfetcalfe came to my house, and requested that I would accompany him to the magazine for the purpose of having two guns placed on the bridge, so as to prevent the mutineers from passing over. On our arrival at the magazine we found present Lieutenants Willoughby and Raynor, with Conductors Buckley, Shaw Sculy, and Acting Sub-Conductor Crow, amd Sergeants Edwards and Stewart, with the native establishment. On Sir Theophilus Metcalfe alighting from his buggy LIeutenant Willoughby and I accompanied him to the small bastion on the river face, which commanded a ful vlew of the bridge, from which we could distinctly see the mutineers marchiDg m open column headed by the cavalry; and the Delhi side of the bridge was alreadv in the possesSion of a body of cavalry. On Sir Theophilus, Metealfe observing this he proceeded to Lieutenant Willoughby to see if the City-gate was closed against the mutineers. However, this step was needless, as the mutineers were admitted directly to the Palace, through which they passed cheering. On Lieutenant Willoughby's return to the magazine the gates of the magazine were closed and barricaded, and every possible arrangement that could be made was at once commenced on. Iside the gate leading to the park were placed two 6- pounders, double charged with grape, one under Acting SubConductor Crow and Sergeant 5tewart, with the lighted matches in their hands, and with orders that if any attempt was made to force that gate both guns were to be fired at once, and they were to fall back on that part of the maga. sine in which Lieutenant Willoughby and I were posted. The principal gate of the magazine was similarly defended by two guns, with the che&aux defniee laid down on th t inside. For the further defence of this gate and the magazine in Its vicinity there were two 6-pounders so pLacedas either to command the gate and a small bastion In lts vicinity. Within 60 yards of the gate and in front of the office, and commanding two cross-roads, were three 6- pounders and one 24-pounder howitzer, which could be so managed as to act upon any part of the magazine in that neighbourhood. AZter all these guns and howitzers had been placed ;i the several positions abovenamed, they were loaded with double charges of grape. The next step taken was to place arms In the hands of the native establishment, which they most reluctantly received, and appeared to be in a state not only of excitement, but also of nsubordination, as they refased to obey any orders Issued by the Europeans, particularly the Mussulman portion of the establishment. After the ahove arrangements had been made a train was laid by Conductors Buckley, Scully, and Sergeant Stewart, ready to be fired by a preconcerted signal, which was that of Conductor Buckley raising his hat from his head, on the order being given by ifeutenant Willoughby. The train was fired by Conductor Scully, but not until such time as the last round from the howit7ers had been fired. So soon as the above arrangements had been made, guards from the Palace came and demanded the possession of the magazine in the name of the King of Deiu, to which no reply was given. Immediately after this, the subadar of the guard on duty at the magazine informed Lieutenant Willoughby and me, that the King of Delhi had sent down word to the mutineers that he would without delay bend scaling ladders from the Palace for the purpose of scaling the walls, and which shortly after arrived. On the ladders being erected against the -wall, the whole of our native establshment deserted ushby c imbing up the sloped sheds on the inside of the magazine, san descending the ladders on the outside, after wmhih the enemy appeared in great number on the too of the walls, and on whom we kept up an incessant fire of grape, every round of which told well, as long as a single round remained. P'revious to the natives deserting us, they hid the priming pouches, and one man in particular, Xurtreembuksh, adurwan, appeared to keep up a constant commnicaionwith the enemy on the outside, and keep them informed of our situation. Lieutenant Willoughby was so annoyed at this man's conduct that he gave me an order to shoot him should he again approach the gate. Lieutenant Raynor, with the other Europeans, did everything that possibly could be done for the defence of the magazine, and where all have behaved so bravely it is almost impossible for me to point out any particolar individual. However, I am in duty bound to bring to the notice of Government the gallantry of Conductors Buckley and Scully on this trying oecasion. The former, assisted only by myself, loaded and fired in rapid suoession the several guns above detailed, firiDg at least four rounds from each gun, and with the same steadiness as if standing on parade, although the enemy were then some hundreds in number, and kept up a continual fire of musketry on us, within 40 or 50 yards. After firing the last round Conduetor Buekley received a musket-ball in his arm, above the elbow, which has since been extracted here. I at the same thne was struck in the left hand by two musket-balls, which disabled me for the time. It was at this critical moment that Lieutenant Willoughby gave the order for firing the magazine, which was at once responded to by Conductor Scully firing the several trains. Indeed, from the very commencement he evinced his gallantry by volunteering his services for blowing up the magazine, and remained true to his trust to the last moment. As soon as the explosion took place such as escaped from beneath the ruins-and none escaped unhurtretreated through the saUyport on the river face. Lieutenant Willoughby and I succeeded in reaching the Cashmere Gate. What became of the other narties it is impossible for me to say. Lieutenant Raynor and Conductor Buckley have escaped to this station. Severe indisposition prevented my sending in this report sooner. I have, &o., G. FORREST, Lieutenant, Assistant Commissary of Ordnance. N.B.-After crossing the river, on the night of the 11th. I observed the whole of the magazine to be on fire, so that I am in hopes that little of the property fell into the hands of the enemy. Park-Sergeant Iloyle was shot about 11 am. by the mutineers, in attempting to reach the magazine to aid in its defence. (To bo continued.)
MYSTERIOUS DEATn LN THE REGENT'S CANAL. -On Wednesdry evening, shoitly before 6 o'clock, con. siderable alarm was created i: consequence of the discovery of the body of a male person in the Regent's canal at Twig Folly-bridge, Green-street, Bethnal-green, under very mysterious and auspicious circumstances. Itappears that a young man named George Goathy, a labourer, was standing on the bank of the Regent's-canal immediately at the rear of the Queen's Arms publichouse when he suddenly saw a human body rise to the surface of the water in front of him. HeIraised an alarmand called several men tohis assistance, when the body was got on to the towing-path. The body presented a shocking spectacle, there being two large incised wounds in the neck, from which blood was issuing, and there were also severe contusions on the face and body, evidently the result of considerable violence. The hands were muoh bruised, and the body had only been in the water about two days. There were two cauts, about an inch in depth, in the front of the throat, inticted before death, and the result of the examination was that the deceased bad come by his death by some foul and unfair means. Several active officers of the K division have made inquiries In the neighbourhood of the canal, and ascertained from Persons living near the spot where the deceased was found that on the morning of Monday last, between 1 and 2 o'clock, they were arous&d by cries of " Murder!' and I I Police!" aud, although several persons left their beds they were unable to learn the cause of the outcry, or make any discovery. The body was placed in a shed at the back of the Queen's Arms, to await the coronor's inquest. FALL FroM A STEEPLr,-On M4onlday afternoon, while William 'lKay, slater, residing in Leith-walk, was engaged in repairng the steeple of North Leith Church he had occasion to ascend a ladder from the roof of the church to the balcony of the spire, but, unfortunately, while he was at an elevation of 50 feet above the roof the ladder slipped with him, and he fell upon the roof.

BANKRUPTCY COU21T, BuinghaU dred, Oct. 15. IT RZ TB2 J-0USHOLDERS' GEiNUIE BREAD AN'D FIWU& COMPANY.-"LIITn" I sf RfM(Th f . xnls was a petition presented by Mr. Weymouth, on behalf of Mr. S. Brookes, a contributory, praying for a winrding-up ordes against the above company. A printed prospectus of the company contains the follov ng informatio land statements -" The capital propo was A M In 1 18sharea of IO1. with power to increase to 100,0001., 21. per share to be paid up. The chief office was 5, Chatham-place, Blaokfrars, the central bakery and flour stores being in St. John-street, ClerkenwelL The trustees 'were :-The Right Hon. tho Earl of Devon * Mr. John James Ridge M.D., J.P., Milton-on-Thames; and the Rev. Henry ilip Haughton, M.A., St. Jamei;s'Parsonage, V.P. he direetors were :-Mr. William Bridge. water, Portland-street, Cheltenhami- Mr. John James Ridge, MD.; Mr. Thomas E. *eller, Duke-street, Adeiphi, and Putney; Mr. WilLiam Webster, Walthamabbey; Mr. George Gaviller Styles, Knock-hall, Greenhithe; Mr. Edward Lacey, J.P., Baynard-castle, Gravesend, and Lacey-terraco, Walworth; Mr. Henry Harainge, M.D., 24, SckviDe-streot, Piceadilly; and Mr. Alfred Adlard, Wardrobe-place, City, and Epping. The auditors were Mr. Henry Croysdill, publio accountant, Basingballstreet; and Mr. Richard Arkwright Charliton, public accountant, Bucklersbu n.t The prospectus commences with an intimation that "tno great success and rapid development of the varions companies established for ministering to the wants and enjoyments of the people form a record of the value and beneficial effects of associated enterprise and capital, and that all objections are now removed to the appheation of funds to joint-stock companies by the sanction extended by Government to the salutary principle of limited liability,and the psg of that sound and beneficial Act of the last session o arliament which protects persons against all partnership risks, however large the profits." I next proceeds to intimate that " the efforts of the publio have long been directed to procure that most 'essential necessay of life-bread, at a reasonable price. It Is not, however, of ' the price' alone, that ' the public have cause to complain,' forI the recenrt disclosures under the Analytical Sanitary Commision have shown that much of the bread manufactured irn London is adulterated to an extent that renders it highly prejudicial to health.' " " The object of the Householders' Genuine Bread and Flour Company is to remedy these evils," and "furnish the public, aud especially the poor, with pure, wholesome, and nutritious bread and flour at the lowest possible price."' The "injurious mixtures" in the existing bread, the "disclosures made before the Seloct Committee of the House of Commons on the adulteration of food, and particularly bread," having been next represented as "perfectly astounding," it is said to be "a matter of surprisethat hitherto no public company has directed its energtes to the removal of so great a social mischief." The " enterprise of the company as intended for the purpose-first, of pur c g quantities of the finest red and white wheat for casn," thereby " securing to the shareholders the profit which in ordinary bakers' establishments gces to the miller; next, to manufacture by machinery and bake the bread on a very extended scale the company's central premises, the entire operation being above ground, with all the advantages and appliances of science and art, as well as of the Scotch and continental methods of baking." "Depots will be established in every part of London and the suburbs, that all classes may avail them. selves of the benefits of pure and wholesome bread, at from 10 to 15 per cent. below the usual charges." It is not, how. ever, " proposed to interfere with the trade of the respectable established bakers who sel a genuine article at a fair price, and care will be taken to have no dep6t so near as to operate to the injury of such tradesmen." It is next in. timated "that the English visiting Paris are invariably strtickwith the superior quality of the bread supplied at the caf6s and restaurants." This " want will now be supplied, and not only will the clubs and hotels requirea largequan tity of the company's breadI but it is well known that the nobility and pnvate families of foreigners and others Are equaly desirous of obtaining it." " Arrangements" are " making with an eminent French baker for manufacturing the best and finest bread (the French pain de Gruaux) and other French breads," and this "need" will be supplied. In order to "guarantee the utmost purity and nutrition" in the company's bread and flour, arrangements have been made with an eminent analytical chymist, a publlc officer of health, who will " test" and exercise a constant supervision, and "the cooperation of experienced medical men on the board of directors will secure that Important object." " Such are the means adopted" by the company, "and it is forthepublic to aid the directors In effectually curing long existing evils and "promoting the greatest amount of good to the greatest number." The "soundcommercial principls upon which the company is based " are next touched upon. They " appeal to the health, pockets, and comforts of aU bread consumers and these mustoperate as motives forinvesting spare capita in such an undertaldng." The "result of the nicest calculation, founded on the views of most experienced persons, is that the directors announce that they will be enabled to divide as profits among the shareholders at least 20 per cent. per annum, which they propose to do at the rato of 5 per cent. every three months, and by great attention to all outlay, and wholy avoiding giving credit, and by economizing the expenses of management, they wUl be enabled to make this dividend free of incometax." The "comfny being formed under the pro. visions of the Lmited Liability Act shareholders are secured against al claim beyond the amount of their shares, and no risk can possibly exist." The " shares of the compy, therefore, ofa ra most eligible mode of investment." The prospectus coiciludes with a reference to " the success of other bread companies," which had "saved a surplus capitl of between 40,0001. and 50,0001M, and divided cent, per cent. on their subscribed capital." The humble petition of Samuel Brookes, of No. 3, Golden. square, a contributory to the company, now set forth, among other statements, the following :-That about May, 1856, certain persons associated themselves for the purpose of forming the company; that the company was completely registered on the 12th of July,1856; that Mr. Edward L6cey, of Gravesend, in the county of Rent, and Mr. James Ridge, of Milton-on-Thames, in the county of Kent, .D., had solemnly and sincerely declared that they were two of the promoters of the company; that the deed of settlement had been executed by shareholders not less than 25 in number, and holding shares in the aggregate to the amount of at least three-fourths of the nominal capital of the company; that in the month of August, 1&56, the petitioner's attention was drawn to an advertiement in e Times newspaper, which advertisement was for the alleged purpose of securing the services of a secretary to the said company, and that the petitioner being desirous of employing his time and a small amount of capital called on the said Edward Lacey, and had an interview with him on the subject of the said advertisement, and at such interview the petitioner was induced by the representations of the said Edward Lacey respecting the then alleged flourishing condition and future prospects of the said company to abandon the idea of applying for the secretaryship of the company, and to consent to qualify for and become adirector of the said company; that the petitioner accordingly paid on the 30th of August, 1856, to the company a siim of 2001., and became the holder of 50 shares, and that the said Edward Lacey gave this receipt:- d Aug. 30, is.

The accounts show creditors, 4,491)5. ; liabilities, 3,0001.; assets, 8181. This was the certificate meeting. Mlr. Chidley supported; Mr. Lawrance Op Ded;.~,tst Mr. LAWMAINCE urged that the bankrup ad c rce a debt of 7001. with Messrs. Grissell shortly before his bankruptcy, and at a time when he must bave known that he was in a state of utter insolvency, Other creditors had been served in the same way, and he called for a long suspension of the certificate. Mr. CMIDLEY urged that N essrs. Grissell had sought the bank-rupt, and not he them. He had not adopted the get. money-at-any-cost system ; he had not atternpted to sell goods at any price, and his assignees had the benefit of aU that he possessed. In place of a lengthened suspension he asked for an immediate certificate. His Hoxo UR said, this was the third faluro. The bankrupt ought to have taken warning. It was absurd for a per- son to take to a business of this description without capital. The bankrupt would receive a third-class certificate after six months' suspension, with protection. IS RE THOMXS RODER. The bankrupt was a wholesale druggist, of Falcon-square, trading as Thomas Roper and Co. Iiis debts are stated to be 13,0001.; assets about 8,0001., subject to realization.

His HoNOun ordered a month's adjournment. (Before ,r. Commisioner EVAIss.) mN RE BAINIBRIDGE AND DELL. The bankrupts were shoe manufacturers in Southwark. bridge-road. 'This was a certificate meeting in the case of Dell. Mr. A.

POLICB. MANhSIOX-HOUsF.-The LonD MAyOR requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of 8s. for the poor. box from M1r. Rough, tho foreman of the jury at the Secondaries Court, being the fees received by them for attendance on two trials at the Secondaries Court. GTDHAMG -George Paynter Priestly, a tall thin man, about 30 years of age, was charged with having unlawfully in his possesion a obeck for 5L, which had been stolen from the person of Lady Shaw. Arthur RoIIs said, I am a clerk in Hoare's bank in Fleet. street, and Lady Shaw has an account there. Yesterday mormng the prisoner came 'with a check, which he presented about 12 o'c ock, drawn by Lady Shaw for 51., but as pay-. ment of the check had been stooced I asked him fromi 'whom he received It and his manner 'was so confusid and his answer"that It wasven. to him to get cashed 'so unsatisfactory, that I called the attention of another clerk to the prisoner, who was therefore ushered into a private room and eventuAlly given into custody. Lady Shaw said, I reside at 8, Kensington-gore. The check produced i8 one I drew upon Hoare's bank a few days back on leaving Brighton. I went to Hoare's hank yesterday, and obtained Iyyment of a check for 20L in two 51,-notes and 104 in gold, and on leaving the bank I saw the 54-check safe in my purse. I then proceeded to 3, Bedford place, where I dined, and afterwards accompanied Mr. and Clarke to a meeting to be held at the Rev. Canon Dale's Schoolroom, near St. Pancras Church, relative to the Indian mutinies. I walked to Bedford-place, and had my purse quite safe at that time and from there I iode to the meeting, on leaving whicb I missed my purse, containin the 54-check produced, and the whole of the contents oZ my pocket, includling the 2014 I had previously received fcr the 201 check. The prisoner said he was sent by a man in Whitechapel bo get the check cashed, and he 'was to have 5s. for his trouble. Alderman GASIEL said he should remand the prisoner for further Inquiry, as it was uite evident that Lady Shaw's poclEet had been picked, and this check was a part of the produce of the robDery. Remanded accordingly. BOw-STRXET.-A veterinary surgeon, named Arthur SeweR was summoned, as the proprietor of a cab and horse, for cruelty to the latter, in allowing the poor animal to be worked in a pitiable state of disease and weakness. The poor brte had been examined by Mr. Cherry, the veterinary surgeon to the police, whose description of its miserable condition was most distressing. It was a thorough. bred mare, young, but extremely poor and iD, evidently suffering from internal disease. It had sores on the shoulders and all over the body. One on the shoulder, which would be under the shaft when the mare was in the cab, was very large. The knees wore bruised and cut. The mare was so utterly unfit for work that he had thought it his duty to serve a notice on defendant at the time, to prevent him from continuing to use her-a course not usually adopted when a case was pending. When called upon for his defence Mr. SeweU carelessly replied that he had nothing to say - he left the matter en. tirely in the magistrate's hands. Mr. HALL, with some surprise, asked if the defendant had no excuse to offer for his conduct ? Defendant.-Oh, the mare was very poor and ought not to have been put In a cab. My foreman sent her out. I should not have done so. She had been turned out to grass. In answer to his worship Mr. Cherry expressed his opinion that the mare ought to be killed; bat the defendant objected saying that " It would be a pity to destroy her." Mr. 'ALL,-If you are obstinate I have power to send you to prison for three months without a fine, and if you attempt to 'work 'ids mare agJain I wll do so. Let there be no misunderstandng betwreen us, for I dwill not permit yotu to trifle 'with me. What can be the use of keeping the poor brute alive and torture 'when you can't be allowed to work her. 1 Defendant.-I'll make her a present to a friend to drive inaM1 a protested aginst this as even more cruel than 'working her in the cab, but defendant to the last declined to consent to have the mare killed, or snake any promise, except that he would not again work her in a cab. Mr. Cherry would take good care of that ; he would not tolerate the employment of such a horse in a public vehicle, at all Gvents. Ultimnately Mr. HAIL imposed a fine of 31. on the defendant, who, with an air of satisfaction, paid the money and withdrew. MARLnoRoouGn-sTrt.-Henry Parker was charged with burglarfously entering a house, No. 16, St. Martin'scourt, and stealing a quantity of property. Remanded for a week. TaEA.ms.-Two Arabs named Mahomet and All, charged with stabbing Mariano Francisco and Francisco Lerponcho Manilla seamen, in Shadwell, on the afternoon of Suday' the 27th of September, were brought before Mr. SELFi for final examination. Mr. SELFx formally coamitted Ali for trial, and delivered Mahomet to the care of Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes, on that gentleman entering into a surety in the amount of 401. for hs appearance at the sessions to answer a charge of felo. niousty wounding.

The Vestry Clerk said, he had received a letter from Mr. Ayrton, M.P., excusing himself from attendiDg by reason of his absence froun town. Mr. Butler, M.P., had been written to, but had not returned any reply.

ST. MARTlN'S-IN-TEE-FIELDS. A n sh1ic meeting of the inhabitants of this parish was held yesterday in the Vestry-rooms, the Vicar the Rev. Mr. lIlruplpreys presidling. Mr. l)A NEhFI ELI), the vestry clerk, read a number of lt Acrrs from lpari,,hioners who were absenit but who fully concurred in, the objects of the ;eeting, including the Marquis of Clanricarde, Sir J. NV. Hogg, Mr. D. Durton, Mr. TLawence, the surgeoni of Whitehall, who enclosed 5. in addition to 201. previously subacribed, Mr. Tooke, enclosing 10/., Sir lt. Gardiner, and others, Contributions of :ill. Iiss. from 3essrs. H.lling, Stono, and Pearce, 41. 7s. fromn Messrs. Pinclhe's workmen, &c., were announced. 'T'he liev. CheA1i.tMAN, in opening the proceedings, said, tliy were invited to nianifest symnpathy with, and to relieve V-: sufferings of, thoso who were the victims of an un;,;r,l luled outburst of Oriental treachery and cruelty, which b-Ai led to the sacrifice of numerous British lives, the &eitruction of a vast arnount of property, and the redulct:on of thousandis from a state of opulence and c*mifort to a conxdition of complete destitution. He th,ui-4ht, also, that they ought to record their feelings of reepcot and gratitudo to the bravo soldiers who were now fighctiug our battle in the East against countless odds and under burning heat, drenching rain, and the destroying chole a. That gratitude could not be shown in a better mne liner than by contributing to a fund to which the vridows and orphans of soldiers who might lose their lives in our cau'e could ap,peal in the hour of need. (Ilear.) dir.Churcbwarlen liosg said, sonirc persons attributed the mutiny to the ildig'sation caused amiong the natives by the annexation of Ohide, but if it was our encroaching spirit that had really produced the outbreak how did it happen that the PIanjab, which we had so recently annexed, had not risen against us instead of its inhabitants fighting as they wore doing m,ost gallantly on outr side ? (Hear.) The transference of all po wer froim theEast India Company tothe Bo -rd of Control would not remove the evll which existed, although no doubt the Company, like every other purely commercial body, had too much neglected the moral and social cultivation of the people of India, and had lowered the character of the English nation by a systematic abase. ment of the Christian religion. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Rose concluded by moving- "That thic ine,etisc dalres t) exproeq Itt profound sympathy with the survIvora, and with the relation5 asod friends of our coiuntryruen and couiitrywou,u who bhave bee. o bhrha.roudy tortured and murdcmol by tho relel 8prys, aled to record i's abhorrence of the unspe3akable atreciites clessalcesy porpetrAted by the mutineera upon u: offen til:g v,.eneu asa dhilren; and while this meetnig dieclatms all i eas of venzoauco.

Last evening m reeting of the inhabitants of Greenwich, c nlivened by the vicar and churchwardens, was held at the Lcam'ure-hall. l'he chair was occupied by Admiral BAILLIX HAMILTON, who said it must be regretted that the Government had thought fit to onic murage a system of heathea superstition, ad to discourage in iiiany ways the progress of Christian iriusciples. Healludedto the resignation ofhis commission by Sir P. Maitlaud, arid to other imstances in which Chris. tVan ollicersanjd soldiers had ref used to honoucr the rites and observaroces of Hlindoolsm, and then enforce the necessity c*f insproving the mneans of communication between this C /i try and India. He hoped the Goverumentt would. w n-ntsr regard to coqt, carry out a telegraphic system In ord r ti obtain earlier intelligence. Had such a system ex. isc-ed a large suru of mioney and many valuable lives might hav- been saved. ''lue Rev. J. NoRsr-t moved the first resolution, expressive of leartfelt sympathy with the sufferings of those who were Jn Inrdia at the period of the outbreak, and who are now exp'-ved to the danger of atrocities committed without re- ispect to sex. General CL.ArK; seconded rhe resolution in a speech strongly condensoatory of the policy pursued for many years by the Government in India with regard to the en- couragement of Hindooisin. He referred to several doonnients to show that Christians had been called on to nresent offerings to idols, and Christian officers compelled to fire salutes in observance of beathen rites. The Rev. C. F. S. MoNE Y, A.M., incumbent of St. John's, Deptford, moved the appointment of a committee to collect sulbscriptions. *Ir. Yo-No seconded the resolution, wh;ch was adopted, and, after a vote of thanks to the chairman, the meeting separated. SOUTH SHIELDS. A meeting of the inhabitants of South Shields was h '!d In the Town.hall on Taesday evening, The Mayor presided. Mr. MIsA1t, H.P., proposed the first resolution. IHe mnaintained that the outbreak was a military revolt, had not the sympathy of the people, and, in fact, did not extend beyond the North-Western Provinces. Heshowed that the landoivners and the peasantry had every reason to respect the Indian Government ; and that the women of India had to be thankful for our rule, inasmuch as it had abolished most cruel and fearful c-torms of wliclh they and their chUdren rpVF thls victimns. Ele hoped that the palates and temples Tbere the Sepoys had committlathelr cold-blooded cruelti3s v oild be levelled to the daut. '140b Rev. J.

The Bishop of London was present, and several other former FeUows. The chapel, though much criticised, seems oni the whole to be regarded as an architectural success. The view from the garden, which has been newly arran)ged, and is now thrown open to the public, gives etpecial satisfaction. CAMBRIDGE, OCT. 15.

T-LE NAW TIONAL ASSOCIATION POR TRE ADYA.NCBA[NT OF SOCIAL SCIENCE. (FROM OUR Owm RRZVTnpc: I BIRMINGHAM, TRURSDAtY. Loat evening the Mayor (Kr. John Ratcliff) entertained at dinner about 200 guests -townsmen and members of the association-ut Dee's Royal Hotel. Among those present were Lord Brougham, Lord J. Russell, Lord Ward, Earl Talbot, Lord Calthorpe, Lord Stanley, Lord Ingestre, Lord Alfred Churchill, Sir J. Pakington, Mr. W. F. Cowper, M.P., Sir Thomas Winnington, M.P., Sir Charles Hastings, Mr. W. Scholefield, M.P., Mr. C. B. Adderley, ALP., Mr. R. Hanbury, MP., Mr. Slaney, 3LP., Mr. E. Akroyd, ALP., Sir B. Brodie, Dr. Livingston, the Hon. and Rev. G. M. Yorke, Dr. Playfair, Dr. Begg, the Recorder of Birmingbamn, the Rev. Sydney Tarner, Dr. Conolly, Mr. Arthur Helps, Mr. George Dawson, the Rev. Canon Miller. Mr. C. H. Bracebridge, Mr. J. F. Winfield, Archdeacon Sandford, &c. After the umsu l loyal toasts, the MATuYO (who occupied the chair) gave "the Army and Navy," which was received with speeal honour by those present. Colonel GOitDON and Earl TALBOT acknowledged the toast. The mention of General Havelock's name by the noble earl was followed by a hurst of cheering. The MAYOR gave, " Lord Brougham and the National AEsociation for the Advanceaent of Social Science." Lord BRorcIIAAM said,-Allow me to tender my very best and heartiest thanks-first to you, Mr. Mayor, for the kind hospitality with which you have received me here to.day ; next for the kind mention of the association which you have been pleased to make in givinD this toast; and then to return my grateful thanks to this iarge and most respectable company for the manner in which they have beea pleased to receive that proposal. We owe to yoa, Mr. Mayor, and to this great town the signal advantage of having our new insitution originated in the capital of the midland counties-the renowned capital of one of the twro great branches of British industry-illustrated still more, permit me to add, by having been the residence and the seat of the discoveries and inventions of sonie of the greatest benefactors of mankind, who have gained for themselves immortal fame, and shed ever-enduring blessings upon their country and their kind by their prodigious discoveries in science and inventions in the arts. Let rme only add my fervent hope, as well as confident expectation, that the fame of this great mass of art, of science, of manufactures may be yet further extended by the progress which we shall see made in those sciences in wbich humanity has the nearest, and the dearest interest in consequence of the foundation which you bave allowed us here to lay of this association. (Loud cheers.) " The House of Lords" was proposed by Mr. COwrEsR, M.P., and responded to by Lord WARD. Sir B. BRODIE proposed "The House of Commons," couplng with the toast the name of Lord J. Russell. Lord J. RU.SSELL.-I beg leave to return thanks in the name of the Mouse of Commons for the honour you have just done it. It may seem that the 'House of Comrnons is not very thoroughly associated with the pursuit of social science, because it so happeDs that that House in the discharge of its many functions and labours usually devotes the early part of its sittings to the consideration of the expenditure of the State, the taxes which it is necessary to maintain and impose, and to various other matters, some of them of no great consequence, while it is not until the weather is grow. ing hot and men's attention is pretty well exhausted that we find time to attend to questions of social science. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) That has been the case, I am afraid, for many years past. I hope that It will not continue for many years to come, but that some better arrangement will be made for transactisig the business of the House of Commons. But, gentlemen, in speaking for the House of Commonis at the present time, you may permit me to glance, and to glance only, at what may be their occupations in the next session. I trrt it will not he their occupation to find the means, either in the shape of men or money, for putting an e:id to the mutiny in India. (Hear, hear.) The House of Commons has shown its readiness to pass any vote, whether for men or for money, for that purpose, but I trust that by the month of January or of February, when Parliament wilU meet again, we shall have the assurance that that sanguinary mttiry and rebellion has been entirely suppressed. (Cheers.) I think that those gallent men who have been mentioned to-night by Earl Talbot-Havelock, Nicholson, Nelll-wi 1 but need as reinforcements thosw troops which are already pouring ia botil from our colonies and from the united kingdom, to enable them entirely to suppress the revolt of those who, even at present, with all the advantage of surprise, -with all the advantages of tenfold numhers, have been totaUy unable to meet British soldiers in the field. (Loud cheers.) Trusting, then, we shall hear tlb tt the mutiny bas been suppressed, I trust we shall likewi!e hear that justice has been done. (Hear.) For, gentlemien, I am not ashamed to say that, as when I hear of a single murder in this country-and unhappily, they are too frequently heard of-as when I bear of the murder of a mian, a woman, or a child, I enter. tain no vindictive spirit, but rt the same time desire that the murderer may be brought to justice and made to atone for bis crime e; so likewise when I hear of murders of nn- exampled atrocity and magnitude I wish-to see the murderers ofhluitdredsaadequately punished. (Cheers.) Let us reflect that there has been no extenuation for these crimes -crimes as great as human nature is capable of committing; indeed, a few weeks ago I should have said ",crimes which human nature Is incapable of committing." (Hear, hear.) At the same time it is my hope, and no doubt the bope of all of us, that justice wiU be performed with discrinmination. For instance, one account which I saw mentions a guard of Scpoys who had protected our officers and their wiyes for a certain distance, and then left them in a safe place to join the rebels. They should not be treated in the same way as the murderers I bave spoken of; but I feel sure-such Is the sentiment of British soldiers, such is the sentiment of the British nation !-we may trust that, great as the provocation has been, no more than justice will be performed. (Hear, hear.) If, therefore, gentlemen, we shall have heard that the nmutiny has been suppressed and justice has been done, we shall still have a great task before us, a task which it will be for us by and by to consider, which it will be impossible to anticipate now, and which it would be unvise to anticipate if it were possiblu to do so -viz., tbo consideration of what inquiry should be made as to the past, and in what way the government of India should be modified for the future. (EHear, hear.) In regard to that last qaestion, I have already said all that it is possible to say now; but this, I must confess, weighs upon ny mind:-I think it is a humiliating reflection that a hundred years after the victory of Plassey those whom we have ruled and whomn we no doubt wished to civilize-for I believe there never was a Government more benevolent in its intentions than the Government of India - should be found with hearts so inhuman and dispositions so savage. (Hear, hear.) Let us hope that, if the government of India is entrusted to us by an Almighty Providence, the results of that government may be more satisfactory, and that under our rule these 200,000,000 people will be brought to know more thoroughly what is the religion we profess, and what is the degree of civilization to which we have attained. (hear, hear.) It only now remains for me to thank the Mayor and other gentlemen for the reception they have given to the association which has met here. I do trust that great auendments in the law, with great social progress, may arise out of it. At all events, it wil be a satis action to those who belong to this association to have inaugurated it under the anspices of one who from the commencemnent of his political life has exhibited such proofs of his regard for the welfare of the people. (Cheers ) So far I have spoken for the House of Commons and this association. You will, perhaps, permit me to make only this remark regarding myself :-I am very sensitive that the compliments you have paid me are far higher than I in any way deserve, but I wil say that those opinions in favour of liberty and progress which are attributed to me have not only not been modified, hut have been strengthened in after life. (Cheers ) Lord BROl.-,I55A proposed the health of the Mayor, and spoke warmly of his munificent hospitality, and the countenance and support whioh he had given to the association. The MAYvOR having acknowledged the compliment, Mr. ARTRtHs. HELPS (in the absence of Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who was unable to be present owing to a railway detention) proposed the health of the Vice President, He was one of those who looked with especial interest upon that part of social science whieh was likely to promote the interests of the poor. Pride of birth was very common among Englishmien, and, for himself, he owned that he had rather be a very medioere man of letters in England thanafirst-rate litt':ro- asor in a foreignland. Hefeared, however, when he sometimes looked at the wretched blocks of houses in large towns, that the working classes had nkot an equial reasor to rejoice iu their native land, and that they did not share fairly in the social blessings which the country at large enjoyed. (Flear.) This inequality, he trusted, would be one of the labours of the new association to remove. (Hear.) The RECORDEiL of Birmingham (Mr. M. D. HTill) ac. knowledged the toast, and in the name of the 150,000 inba. bitants of the blidland metropolis, expressed a hope that science and philantbropy, allied in the association which had just been inaugurated, would never be divorced, and that future mneetings would be redolent of the same benefit that had attended the present Congress. Mr. ADDERLEY, M.P., proposed " Lord Stanley and the Visitors." Lord STANLEY could, with sincere and hearty thanks, say that never did men coming on any errand of this kind meet with a warmer and more cordial reception. Some associations, like somtie individuals, in aiming at more than they coud attain, acconiplished nothing. Now, in seeking for the promotion of social science, he didl not think theyshould develope ideas which were absolutely new, but they did hope to diffuse ideas which were already known to a select few, bht could not, for want of a wider extension and appreciation, be practicaUy applied for the benefit of the classes whom they most directly concerned. In India it often happened that the evils of famine were, for want of adequate means of commnunication, felt in large districts of country, while others were exeinp, from these evils. In like manner intellectual farmine w4f often experienced from the absence of proper opportunities for the interchange of thought. This state of things associations like the present were admirably caloulated to remove. Alluding to the towvn in which they were assembled, he observed that from various circamstances he had always take's the warmest Interest in the great foci and centres of manufacturing industry, and believed that their populations en. joyed upon the whole the greate-t degree both of happiness and freedom of thought. In conclusion he complimented the people of the manufacturing districts upon their independent spirit-which lie hoped would bh preserved nd cherished-in not calling upon the Governument to help them in any matter in which they could help themselves. Among the other toasts given were:-" Tie Presidents of Dclprtueents," proposed by Dr. Playfair, aud responded to by bir J. Pakington; "Success to the Town and 'rrade of Birmingham," proposed by the ri2ht hon. baronet; " The Meembers forthe B )roigh aod the Northern Division of the County," acknowledged by Mr. W. Scholefield - "The Corporation of Birmmisghaui ;" and " The Local &curetaries, with the Seorearises of Departments."
TIIE LATE OUTRAGE ON TIE EASTERN COU?XTIE3 RAILWAY.-On the examination of Professor Rogers, who was struck by the stone thrown at the down exprmss train near Wymondham on Friday week, it was ascertained that tbe lower jaw-bone had been splintered, and that the upper jaw had received a severe fracture. Had the stone struck the temple the injulry, in aU probability, would have been fatal. We hear that the injured gentleman is progressing towards recovery in a very satisfactory manner. The chairman of the Eastern Counties Railway has written to the mayor, expressing his deep concern at the melancholy accident. lIe had himself visited the spot, and made the most searching inquiry, and the company had offered a reward of 101. on conviction, and despatched a special policeman to watch the spot.-Bury and .orwnicA Post.

I THE WATERLOO-BRIDGE MURDER. Xotbing whatever hae been discovered whioh warrant | the hope that the perpetrators of this crime will be speedily I brought to justice. The following letter has been forwardod to us from the Superintendent of Police at Stafford, who fancies that it contains a clue for the identification of the murdered man:- "TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. "Sir,-In reference to the late horrible murder and mutilation Irespectfully beg to caU your attention to the followving: l On the 29th ult. a person who gave the name of Hugh Patterson called at the residence of Mr. John Lea, a respectable shoe manufacturer of this town, and purchased of him a large quantity of boots and shoes, for which he paid. He stated that he had recently returned from Melbourne, in Australia, where he kept a large shoe shop. He said he intended going to London, and from there to his native place in Scotland, where a boy of his not long ago met with an accident which caused his death, and that he might be again expected at Stafford in about three weeks. He had a large carpetbag that corresponded most minutely with the deserip. tion given of the one found on an abutment of Waterloo. bridge on the morning of Friday last. When here he said the bag contained about 3,8001. in gold, and asked both Mr. and Mrs. Lea to lift it; owing to which they had each an opportunity of inspecting the same, and, as before stated, they say it exactly corresponds with the one found. ' He appeared between 30 and 40 years of age, and about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, dark hair, and dressed in dark clothes, but had other clothing; it was noticed that he had red lining in the sleeves of his coat, and the legs or bottom of the trousers were very wide. He wore a black silk necktie, and shirt collar turned down. He also caUed at the mantfactory of Messrs. Bostock and Woolley, of this town; likewise at the manufactory of Mr. Bostock, of Stone, from each of whom he was about on his return to make some large purchases. Their description corresponds with that given by Mr. and Mrs. Lea, and they are all of opinion that the deceased is the same person that was here. "1 He said he intended to call at Roman and Co.'s, 25, Skinner-street, London. " Should I derive any further information I will apprise you thereof forthwith. I Tn h-rt. vmxuv onv I _' M. RICHARDS, Chief of Police. Borou2h of Staffora. UunUau, ;)tanora, Uct. .L4 I,.S. I have sent a copy of this to Mr. Superintendent Durkin."
RAILWAY INTELLIGBNCE. PERNAMBTTlC.o [T.TmTT7Wnx The half-yearly meeting of this company v;as held yesterday at the London Tavern; Mr. R. Benson in the chair. The Secretary read the report, which stated that in fulfilment of the promise given by their chairman at the last half-yearly meeting the directors had sent to the share. holders an analysis of the concessions and decrees of the Imperial and Provincial Governments of Brazil under which this company had been formed and the guarantee of 7 per cent, been secured. In April last an parties concerned looked forward to an opening of the line at least early in this autumn, but many unavoidable delays have occurred to prevent it. The line is now in such a position as to leave no doubt whatever of the opening taking place in December next-the assurance of which has been since confirmed by the manager, from whom the directors have received advices down to the 9th of September, in which he states that " The line will certainly be ready for opening on the 2d of December," the birthday of his Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, and adds, "We may be able to carry a truck of sugar the whole length from Cabanga to the Cape within a fortnight." The whloe of the rolling stock and other requisites for the workin- of the traffic of the first section have long since arrived at )?ernambuco in perfect condition. The whole of the materials for the second section will by this time have arrived in Peruambuco. The land plans are reported to be complete, and as the contractor's staff (which has been amply reinforced) and an abundant supply of labourers are nowv actively engaged in its construction the progress of the work on that section will no doubt be rapid. The contractor is now in Pernambuco, and Mr. Ba3liss returns to Brazil by the mail of the 9th inst., his health being perfectly reestablished. Further surveys of the third section have shown that that portion of the line may be considerably improved. The directors have no reason whatever to doubt their being able-notwithstanding the delay which has taken place in completing the first section-to finish the lne within both the capital and the time assigned for its construction; in which they are abundantly borne out by the opinion of their engineer. The directors continue to receive the strongest assurances and evidences of the cordial feeling of both the Imperial and Provincial Governnnents, and of the people of the country at large, towards the undertaking. As one instance of the former, they may mention an order from the Imperial Government not only to discontinue the exaction of a duty called "e xpediente " upon materials for the railway imported into Pernambuco, but to return the amount which had been paid. The directors are happy to state that from the Iprotuptitude with which the cals hitherto made have been paid, no further call wldl be made during the present year. The report of Mr. WiUiam Penisten, the engineer-in-chief, stated, that the whole line had been re-surveyed and levelled from Recife to the confluence of the rivers Pirangi and Una, the result of which has been to show that the Une might be considerably improved without any increase of the cost to the company. Mr. Peniston states that the result of nearly a twelvemonth's experience with the country, the contract, and contractor leads him to believe that the works may and will be efficiently completed without any addition to the contract amount. By a decree of the Brazilian Legislature dated the 26th of Augast, 1857, the Government is authorized to raise one-third of the capil required to Construct the railways of Pernam. buco,Bahia, and Santo Paulo, provided that the companies have called up and expended on the railway works at least 20 per cent. of the capital on which interest is guaranteed. The annual interest and amortization is not to exceed 7 per cent. on the amount borrowed, and the Government is authorized to grant the privileges of that law to the railway companies should it be deemed advisable. The capital account showed that 438,1511. had been received, and 341,6551. expended, leaving a balance of 9.5,0001, invested at interest, and 1,5961. at the bankers. The recei ts to the 1st of August in the Brazils amounted to 15T?5771., and the expenses to 138,043b, leaving a balance of 19,5344 After some observations from the CHAIRMAN, Mr. GmBONS, Mr. PlGcoTr, Mr. GREGORY, and Xr. DE CASTRO the report was unanimously adopted, the retiring directors and auditor were re elected, and the meeting separated.
