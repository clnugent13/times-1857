-From a letter of Blishop Blomfield, dated Fulhai Palace, M3t of December, 1856.
The separation of the richt and the poor by their separte residences in the east and west of London in not to be denied. When we wander through the splendid streest and spacious squares of the western districts we are inclined to exclaint, " Whero are the poor ?I We see on every side the mansions of the wealthy ; we see the highl embellished and decorated shopa which minister to their luxury ; lant we scarcely seec any reDpesentatives or the labouring classce of the metropolis ; and yet. I apprebeno, itlis an unquestionable troth, and -.he necesary result of the law by which society is constructed, that every house which is hault by a nobleman, a banker, or a merchant in Belgrave or Eaton squares, or the adjacent streets. generates a certan samount of Population, which Is cart upon the eastern districts removed out of sight and out of mind, but continually growing andl multiplying im. r'sortsl souls, living, dying, and pwasig into the grave-hundreds and thousands of whom we know nothing, hear nothing, whom we never see, and f or whom we generally do nothing. This is undocubtedly a serieus aLnd appalling state of things. Iti hardly possible to hope that it will receive more than mitigation ; but at the sames time great mnitigationIt may receive. As thebhonoured name ofBisop Blomnfield has been mentioned. I may, perhaps,be permitted to remind the mieeting that to him we owe the Mdetropolitan V8isitng and Raelie Association, which was the first recognition, in&a permanent form, of the duty of the west inwards the east of London, for it was founded onl the express anticipation tnst torough ita meerum a portion of the enormnous wealth expended on the enjoyments of the west-end of the ownmigt b mae avilale or he empoarynecssiiesof the soak-Fom a peech f theRight en.

Tha numaerous and exteustre robberies which have been recently effected constitute a new era in the annals of crime, bath as regardsg the value of the proPerty stolen and the secrecy with which the bus. glaries have been acconplished, and against which all ordinary means of sesruity are are~ntly of no avail.
Tke modern f an housebreaker sets at deflanse the mnost ap. proved lock, the beat constructed iron safe, the strongest fastenings, and the most vigilant watching. so that the property of bankers, Jewellers and other import%at establishmoent4% the occupants of hotels the commercial wareobcuse and the private residence, are alike aces,. sible to his reckless skilL.

Viscount DUNGANNON presented a petition from the Protestant Association of Cork praying the House not to entertain any measure having for its object any interference vith the property nd endowmcents of the Irish branch of the Established Ckurch of Rngland and Ireland.

MINUTES AND JOURNALS, OF THE HOusE.
Earl STANaOPE, ia moving for a select committee to consider whether any and what improvements could be effected in printing the minutes and journals of the Hon%e, adverted to the obligations which their lordships were under to his noble andt learned friend the Chairman of Committees (Lord Redesdale) for the great attentionihe had
given to this subject, and to the able and zealous gentlemen who sat at the table for the ability and accuracy with which the results of their lordships deliberations on every matter that came under their consideration were recorded in the niinutes of the House. Those minutes-admirable so far as they went, as to the mode in which they were kept-compared advantageously in several respects with the votes of the House of Commons, and especially in the clearer and more perfect view they presented of the business with which their lordshipes had to deaL But still, he must say, there were considerable defects and anomalies in the manner of preparing the minutes well deserving their lordsahips attention with the view to a remedy, and which would not be overlooked by a committee in the event of the House consenting to grant one. The main object of his motioa hadreeec to the'numbers and names of peers at divisions of the Hfouse being recorded in the minutes, which at present was not done. As to the numbers, if their lordships searched the minutes from the first day of any session to the last they would find no trace whatever of any single division on any subject which had come under. the consideration of the House, and on which they had divided.
(Hear, .her.) The numbers on a division were not given.
here wasa merbstatement onievery occasion that theirlordships hadresolvedin thenegative orthe affirmative as the case might be,, and, for anything that appeared'on the minutes, any personi might conclude that themr lordships had decided, one way or the other, unanimously. (Hear, hear.) He submitted that that was a very unsatisfactory arrangement, and that the minutes would be much more complete if they showed, at least, the numbers which appeared on a division. Again, as to names, he would ask, was there any valid reason or constitutional ground why the names on a division should be given in the votes of the Rouse of Commons and withbeld, on a similar occasion, in the minutes of their lordships' House? He submitted, as to individual peers, that the conntry had a right to have ample materials before them for estimating the services of every public man in their lordships' House, and that, with that view, irrespective of other reasons, it was right and fitting that the minutes should supply the names of their lordships who took part in every division. He thought it was an additional argument in favour of the arrangement hewasurgingontheirlordships that alreadythe names of peers who attended the Houseevery day were regularly entered upon the journals of the House. As an instance of the value of this system, he miht allude
to perhaps the rmost remarkable scene which ha g occurred
either in this or the other House of Parliament-what wvs generally called the dying scene of Lord Chatham. There was in existence a setter of Lord Camden describing this scene, in which it was said that all the Peers put on the appearance of deep distress with the exception of a certain Lord M-, who seemed entirely unmoved. On reference to the journals of the Ifouse it was shown that two Earls of M- were present (Lordc archmont and Lord Mansfield), and the noble and learned lord (Lord Campbel) had clearly proved that the peer referred to was Lord Chief Justice Mansfield. This showed the value of records of the House in an historical point of view, but he wished to render them still more useful. He
wished to secure the publication of the names of those peers who took part in the divisions. This would render necessary some difference in the mode of voting, but it would certainly involve no additional consumption of time. The noble earl concluded by movieg '-that a select com-
mittee be appointed to consider whether any, and if so,
what improvements can be effected in the printing of the
minutes and journals of the Hiouse, and especiay as to
putting upon record both the numbers and the names of the
peers who take part in the divisions."
Earl GRANVILLE agreed with the noble earl that a record of the names of those peers who voted was very
desirable, and that, having regard both to the honour of this House, nd the utility of its proceedings, it was im-
possibleto give too great publicitv to those proceedings. ihe subject was one which hardly required inquiry, but at the same time he thought the noble earl had taken the wise course of moving for the appointment of a select committee, which in a very short time indeed, and without going into much evidence, would be enabled to come to a satisfactory conclusion.
The motion for the appointment of a select committee was then put and agreed to.
TE1E DIOCESS OF LONDON.
RETIRING PENSIONS FOR BISHOPS.
Viscount DUNGANNON said, it would be in the recollechon of his noble friend (the Earl of Harrowby) that in the debate upon the Bishops of London and Darham Bill at the close of last sessiQn it was intimated, on the part of the Government, that a measure was in contemplation for dividing the see of London and establishing a bishopric of Westminster. It was also stated that the late period of the session prevented the Government from then undertaking any measure making provision for such bishops as were desirous, owing to illness and infirmity, of resigning their sees. The question was one of great public interest, and he was desirous of having it answered. Considering the large amount of funds which must by this time have got into the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, he should hope tnat some measure would be adopted which would obviate the necessitv of muleting the incoming bishops of any portion of their revenues for the support of their predecessors. le was one of those who thought the incomes of the bishops at the present moment scarcely adequate for their support, and he should be very sorry, therefore, to see those incomes diminished even temporarily. Thero was another subject of considerable importance to which he wished to direct attention. A large number of parishes were at present very poorly endowed, and he had that very day put on the order-book a notice for a return of the number of benefices within the see of London possessing endowments under 200. a-year. He hoped that some comprehensive measure would be introduced, providing aminog other things, for increasing the resources of those benefices.
The Earl of HARROWBY acknowledged the importance of the subjects to which his noble friend had referred, and, with regard to the first question put by him, said that the Government thought the division of the see of London was a subject requiring more consideration than had yet been devoted to it, and they had come to the conclusion that the better course would be to appoint a committee to
inquire into the question, connecting with the see of London the acjaent diocese s of
Winchester, with a view f e wether a e could not be somercn co tion of these three sees,
With regard to the question as to whether the Government were prepared to introduce a Bill for providing for bishops,
on the grournd of age or infirmities, he could only say, that desirable as it might be to deal w ith that subject, he was not able at that moment to giv e a definite answer to the uestion of the noble viscount. As concerned increasing the resources of parishes, the Government were not at present prepared to introduce a Bil upon the subject,
ROYAL MA-RN FORCES BIIL. This Bil was read a second time.
Their lordships adjourned at 10 minutes to 6 o'clock.

HOSTILITIES AGAINST ????. M>-:ií^?CíICHERE ?id he Thei to correct a statement which he made yesterday in answer to the question of tne noble lord the member for Tyrone. The noble lord asked whether any instructions had been sent out by the Government of this country in contradiction of the instruofaons sent by Lord Grey to the Superintendent at Hongkong with regard to the employment of miUtary againstthe Chinese. His answer was that he beUeved no instructions had been sent out relating to that subject. He had found once that, although it was perfectly true no instructions had been sent in contradiction of Lord Grey's instructions, yet ?. ?11*?*0115 sent ont which related to the if?..· ,fherefore the answer he gave was not comoletely andUterally accurate. TJnder these circumstances ho thought the best thing he could do would be to lay the paper, which w«f* Mbtary paper transferred from the War Department a .^e.Colonral-omoe, onthe table ot theHouse. It was dated in 1S53. .. Mr. WALPOLE asked whether any more recent instructions had been sent out ? ?. LABOUCHERE believed that the paper alluded to, which was a letter from the Horse Guards intimating á mere opinion, was the only paper relating in any manner whatever to the subject. DTJLWICH COLLEGE. In reply to Mr. T. Dukcomb^ Mr. BAINES said, it was intended to introduce a BUI ror the purpose of carrying out the recommendations of the Oharity Commission with respect to Dulwioh College, and he believed it would be introduced into the House of Lords before Easter. THE VICTORIA ORDER. In reply to Captain SoOBELL, Lord PALMERSTON said, the list of officers of the navy on whom the Order of Victoria for Valour would bo conferred was prepared. The list of ofiicers of the army was in preparation and nearly completed. There would be no objection to the statutes and regulations under which the Urder had been established being laid on the table of the House. THE INCOME-TAX. Major REED said, there was no »Uusion in tho ChanceUor of the Exchequer's resolution to the 5d.-rate of income-tax on incomes above WW. and under lõ«. ?-year. Was it intended to reduce the tax on such incomes to 5cL, or to maintain it on aU incomes at 7d. irrespective of amount ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER explained that, as a matter of form, the maximum amount was stated in the resolution. When a BiU was introduced the provisions would be found to accord with his statement. On incomes under 1Õ0Í. and above 1001. ?-year a rate of 5d. in the pound would be imposed. RAILWAYS IN INDIA. l>MrV°íírVJ?IRA ????·the resident of the Board of Control whethor the Indian Government wouldextend the system of a guaranteed rate of interest upon further capital proposed to be invested in raUways in India beyond that already agreed upon, several raüway schemes having been recently submitted to the jpuohc, upon which the question of a guaranteed rate of interest upon capital was left in doubt. Mr. V. SMITH said, the Indian Government had laid down no positive rule as to future guarantees. They would consider each case as it was brought forward, but, havmg guaranteed interest on 20 mlUions of capital to be laid out ^railways, they were not very desirous of extending their liability. He sincerely hoped some companies would be found to promote raUways in India, as they would be very profitable undertakings without any guarantee at all, POLICE SYSTEM IN BENGAL. Mr. KINNAIRD asked the President of the Board of Oontorol whether he had any objeotion to lay on the table of the House » copy of a despatch relating to the system of police in the Bengal Presidency ? Mr. V.SMITH said there was no objection to the production of the despatch. REMOVALS OF IRISH PAUPERS. Mr. MAGUIRE asked the President of the Poor Law Board whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce in the present Bession any measure with a view to abolish or to modify the Uw under which the Irish-born g rar were being daUy removed to certain seaports in Ireland om England and.Wales and Scotland, and/if so, at what penod of the session would it be introduced Î Mr. BOUVERIE said, it was quite useless to introduce a measure which the Government could not hope to carry. Last year he introduced a BiU on thissubject in conformity with the recommendations of a committee, but the ?? was received with indignation from many parts of England, ^^^??10?,^?&^*???? n° ^PPort what' ? ? ¿^?: (?'?'??.) ?? was obliged to abandon it, and after that expenence he wasnot disposed to reintroduce it. If, however, tho hon. member attempted to bring in a JSÚ1 to which he could assent, it should receive every assistance in his power. Mr. MAGUIRE said he should be happy to adopt the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman. GUANO ISLANDS. Lord NAAS asked the Vice-President of the Board of lïade whether any correspondence had taken place between the Government and Messrs. Ord, Hudson, and Hayes, of Liverpool, relative to the license which had been granted to them, givingthem for five yearsthe exclusive right of raising and exporting guano from tho three islands of Jibleea, Hanki, and Ghnrzeaa on the coast of Arabia : and, if so, whether he would lay that correspondence onthe table of the House ' Also, whether any guano had been raised from the isUnds, or whether the agents of the Ucenseeshad been driven away by the Arabs? J Mr. LABOUCHERE beUeved the facts of the case to be these :-Some time »go this firm of Liverpool merchants appUed for a license to obtain guano from these islands, which had been ceded bv the Imaum of Muscat to the Government of this country. The discovery ofthe islands having guano was made by Captain Ord, and the Government, as a proper encouragement, granted to the firm an exclusive license. They were also informed that, as far as practicable, they should receive such support from the Government as could be afforded to them. At the same time, it was an enterprise of a very speculative Datore. The parties to whom the Ucense was granted went to the islande and endeavoured to procure guano. Unfortunately some tribes residing not 20 mfles off, who had a sort of trade there, considered their privileges interfered with. Captain Ord tnd his party applied for assistance to the Bombay Government, but, unfortunately, the Bombay Government was unable at tho time to give that assistance. A good deal of correspondence had taken place upon the subject, and he trusted arrangements would be made by which these parties would be able to proceed to the isUnds and test whether they did or did not afford a supply of the important article of guano. AU that was needed was, that the Government of Bombay should support Captain Ord bythe presence for a few days of a smaU armed vessel That was the state of things at present. The Government were fuUy sensible of the importance of encouraging, by any means in their power, the supply of guano to this country. He beUeved an hon. friend would shortly move for the papers, and there would be no objection to Uy the correspondence on the table of the House. (Hear, hear.) In reply to Sir A. Campbell, t. ^-L^OüCraRE said, that the power of granting these licenses was derived from the Qneenf ? Sir J. FERGUSSON asked whether in the Ucenses which granted a monopoly to these gentlemen there was any reserchareê*3 ????3 W they should be entitled to .rra^Jf B£UCFîP--A monopoly was undoubtedly We ra ¿¿d?? yealS' °f about fonr ???1? THE MEGÆRA. Sir J. PAKINGTON, with the vie w of enabling himself to correct a statement made a few nights ago by the First Lord of the Admiralty as to the state in which the Megæra was aUowed to leavePortsmouth with 500 troops on board, moved that the House, at its rising, do »djourn untU Monday. He had reason to beUeve that the statement was inaccurate. Nothing was further from his intention than to impute an intentional misstatement to the right hon. gentleman. The dockyard authorities, to whom he presumed the right hon. gentleman had applied, musthave suppUed him with imperfect or incorrect information withregard to the Megæra. The House wouldrecoUectthatinansweringhis(SirJ'.Pakington's) question on a previous night tho right hon. gentleman said that she had not sprung a dangerous leak, that it was true two small screw holes had been left open in her bottom, but that she might have gone round the world with a handbucket with perfect safety. Now, the foUowing was an extract from a letter which had been written by an officer on board :-" The vessel started on Monday, and only got 140 mUes on her way when «he sprang a leak, and wa3 in some danger for several hours, the water rushing in at the rate of 20 tons per minute. On Monday night the cabins were fuU of water. A good deal of ourbaîgage was almost destroyed »»««ojf6*^ water.» He had received two letters which had been wntten by the officer who commanded the ship. He was bound to say that'they were not addressed to bmself, but had been hanáed over to him by a friendo? ne had written to one of his nearest relations. The first
letter.stated, " We had a tremendous night on' Sunday, and the old «hip leaked like a lieve «U over« "We were up to our knees nearly on the main deck." And in the second ha. said, "Every port and «cuttle on the main deck leaked, ana the mam deck was at least 1-i inchee deep id water, and all the cabina, of course, afloat The leak was discovered about ! ?*8^10 °'cîoclc> *°d ?? made four feet of water v ,t?e foremost compartment in bdf-an-hour.'' Now. he (Sir J. Palcmgton) appealed to the House whether this statement¡of^facts was consistent with the answer of the Jiirst Lord of the Admiralty, and whether that answer was not discreditable to the dockyard authorities. The riebt hon. gentleman had stated that the cause of ue sup's detention at Portsmouth was her unpreparedness to go to «ea; but was it right that the officers who had been. informed that she would leave port before she was actually ready to do so should bear the expense occasioned by the deUy? He (Sir J. Pakington) was only »Undsman-he was not a Lord of the Admiralty-and therefore he could , only judge of these matters by the light of his own under«tandmg ; but he confessed that he should be very sorry to go to sea in a ship that had two holes in her bottom, ani ho conceived that tho right hon. gentleman himself would object to go to eea in such a ship. He begged to ask whether the Megæra had only *wo «m»U »crew holes in her ' bottom when she left Portsmouth, and whether a hand ; bucket would be sufficient to olear out the leakage. Next» he wished to know whether it w*s not true that it was - found necessary at Plymouth to caulk the ship aU over, in ? addition to stopping the two »crew holes desoribed by thenght hort gentleman. In consequence of the ship going-to> seam an imperfect stato a great deal of the officers'property was damaged by water and some of it had béètt destroyed. An intimate friend of his, Major Grey, who was in command of the 85th detachment of troops, was going m the ship with his wife and famUy to the Mauriting for two years. That gaUant officer took s great deal ot valuable property witbhim, and the greater part of it had teen destroyed or injured. (Hear, hear.) He (Sir J_ Pakington) wished to know whether any compensation: would be given to these offioers, whose property had thus· been injured by the negUgence of the dockyard authorities. Sir C. WOOD was obliged to the right hon. baronet forthe notice which he had given him of his intended question, asit had enabled him to bring down papers that wouht justify his answer on» previous occasion, and also for hi* having done him the' Justice to «ay that he did nótbeliévehe(Sir C. Wood) would intentionally make an inaccurate statement. But he wished to premise that he had neversaid that the ship was sent to «ea with two holes in her bottom. What he said was that it was discovered when· «he was taken into dock at Devonport that there were two »crew-holes in her bottom whioh had not been properly fastened. When ho said the other night that two small' holes were found in her bottom an hon. gentleman got. up and contradicted him, by saying that he was perfectly wrong in saying that the screw-holes were at the bottom o£ the ship, because they were merely under the bows. He (Sir C. Wood), however, apprehended that a ship had a bottom under her bows as weU as at her stern. (Roars of laughtersHe could not pretend to »ay what took pl»ce when the ship was at sea; what he could state was the condition in. which she was found when taken into the dockyard. He· held in his hand the report of the officers of the Devonport dockyard. If there had been a dangerous leak it would doubtless have been discovered by those officers. But their statement was,"Two screw-holes were found open, being part of thefastening of the rose, over the end of the head pump, seven f eet under water. The scuttles are of metal, consequently conld not be caulked, but only required the care of the carpenter to bed them in tallow when closed in. The thick lower pieces of ports wore caulked in when the ship was fitted out, but some of them had been turned out since the ship was fitted, and therefore should have been attended toby the carpenter." Such was the condition of the ship when she was taken into the dockyard. No doubt, a quantity of water found its way into the ship through the two screw-holes ; but more passed through the ports, which were not caulked, although no danger could be apprehended from it. Any naval officer could teU them that a hand-buoket would be sufficient to bale out aU the water which could get through. such holes »s those discovered in the bottom of the Megæra. The nght hon. baronet had said that tho ship was tent tò sea in a most improper state. He held in his hand reports from the shipwrights and officers at Portsmouth, and from Captam Pelham, of the steam orderly at Portsmouth, one of the best and ablest officers in the Queen's service. The shipwrights said :- '· The_whole of the ???(? on the main deck, stern ports, and cabin scuttles were fitted in a most careful manner (thestops being fearnaughted and the lower bucklers caulked in), and we_ are therefore unable to »ccount for their having leaked in the manner described. The pipes of Downton's pumps, which had been made good some weeks previously,. wore re-examined and found perfect two or three days before the vessel Eailed. The valves o£ the watertight compartments were thoroughly examined and made good when. the ship was last in dock with her hold cleared. The leaks complained of in the deck and topsides must, we think, have been occasioned by the straining »f the shin, as we satisfied ourselves that the decks were perfectly tight before her sailing, and the topsides had been recently caulked. With respect to the fact of two 'screwbolt's holes being found open through tho bottom part of the fastening of the starboard rose over the lower end of the pipe of the head pump seven feet under water,' we beg to state that the master smith asserts that the holes for these screws were retapped, and that he himself saw that the screws had been put in tight, and the rose effectuaUy secured previously to the being undooked on the 28th of October last. We have no doubt of the correctness of his »ssertion, the vessel having been »float ever since without showing any leakage (after the fest 24 hours) up to the time of her sailing, as appears by the following extract from the foreman of caulkers' sounding book :- Meqæka, mmooKKD 28th October, 1856.

Captam Pelham. examined the Megæra several times, and he reported as foUows :- "More than once on going round the different decks, accompanied by the commander, senior Ueutenant, and master, I make most particuUr inquiries relative to the fitting of the ports, scuttles, bucklers, and hatchway covers -and was assured by them that they had been tried and were correct. The cirpenter on one occasion was of the party ; I questioned him closely on the subject, and he gave me the same assurance. These inquiries respecting the ports, &c., were made some days before the sailing of the Megæra, and there would have been plenty of time to effect «Iterations in those fittings had it been needed. Your order was that every possible assistance of men and stores-, was to be afforded to the Megæra, and that order was fully acted up to." * The officers of the dockyard, having been requested to make a further report, sent in the foUowing :- " We beg further to report, with reference to the last paragraph of Commandor Purvis's letter, that so far from the mam deck and stern ports of the Megæra having been SttfiT t'1 meflìoient manner, thoy were fitted on a planthat had heretofore always given especial satisfaction to the former captam of this ship, as weU as to the captains of the troopships Simoom and Vulcan ; and in regard to execution the work necessary to be done in refitting them was performed by some of the best shipwrights in the yard, selected for this purpose, who, as weU as the officers superintending, were foJly impressed with the importance of the work, and took the greatest possible pains to make it perfect. The stops of the broadside_ports were none of them less than 2¥ mcheswide. In addition to these precautions the ports were carefuUy examined two or three times before the vessel «ailed ; and we are of opinion that with the proper care and attention always necessary to be given to ports, and more especially in » heavy gale of wind, they would have been found as tight as under such circumstances could have been expected."

If hon. members turned to the map, they would see the importance of that treaty »i affecting the interests of Turkey and this country for, in consequence of the territory ceded to Rusa»! m case of hostüities the latter Power could throw IZ^^r?^ ^ fe Styazid, if Persia only remained neutral. It appeared that Russia had now got the cession T.r0Ttf*Whlal shS had endeavoured for yeWtoobtaii? This matter was of great importance, and the House*«
bound to receivo a full explanation of it from the noble lor I at the he d of che Government. He did not know whether the Government had received communications from the Turkish Government on the subject, but if they quietly permitted such a proceeding to take place they abandoned that Power andgave up the cause for whioh they recently Tvent to war. Ho wished to know whether the noble lord had made remonstrances to the Russian Ambassador iu respect to the matter and had asked for explanations. He also desired to learn whether it was true that the negotiation at Pans between Persiaand EDgland had been suspended. He trusted the Housa would aUow him to bring this matter forward for discussion in a few days, unless it should be decidedly stated that the matter was likely to be favourably settled immediately. It was of great importance, and he did not wish to discuss it in any hostile spirit to the Government He was sure the Chancellor of the Exchequer could not ask for any money for the Persian expedition until the matter was debated. Lord PALMERSTON· said, with respect to the treaty alleged to have been signed between Russia and Persia, the Government had no information on the subject, except such as was derived f rom the pubUc prints. Mr. LAYARD.-Have you asked for explanations? Lord PALMERSTON was understood to say that it was not usual to ask for explanations upon the foundation of «ich information. With respect totne second question of the hon. member he could state that it was not true that the negotiations at Paris with the Persian Ambassador had been interrupted or suspended. Those negotiations were stffl going on, and he had no reason to give a different opinion now from that he had before expressed, to the effect that there was a fair prospect of an arnuigement satisfactory to aU parties. (Hear, hear.) In this state of thingä he must again press on the consideration of the hon. membor that a disoussion of the matter in thisHouse must have a very injurious effeot, and he should hope that he should not be thought asking too muoh of the hon. member and the House if he entreated them to forbear a Uttle longer, and allow the Government that freo action in the negotiations which could only be secured by the absence of disoussion for the present. (Hear, hear.) EXPORTS. Mr. NESVDEGATE inquired what was the reason for the issue of an order by the Custom-house authorities in August last that aU shippers of goods for exportation should be more careful in the returns they made both as to the quantities and values. An order had been posted at Manchester and other commercial towns to that effeot. He therefore apprehended that in the returns of trade and navigation before the House the apparent improvement might result to a great extent from more accurate accounts. Mr. WILSON said that some particular officer might have given such a notice at a place where he thought there existed a laxity in the making up of the returns, but he was not aware of any general order to that effect. DESTITUTION AT COLCHESTER, Sir J. TYRELL said that some days ago he asked the Under-Secretary for War a question as to she great state of destitution prevailing at Colchester among Urge numbers of soldiers' wives and chUdren, and the hon. gentleman said he had no information on the subject. Such a state of things was almost unaccountable ; and he felt it his duty to read to the House the foUowing letter, dated February 18, from the physician of Colchester Hospital :- "You may rest assured that no moderate language can convoy an idea of the utter want and deetitution ol some 130 families of soldiers in Colchester. I do not reckon the çhüdren. Were it not for most extensive private benevolence many of these unfortunates must have starved, and would continue to do so. From my medical experiences in London I am qualified to judge in points of want and misery ; but I never saw such wretchedness as is suffered by the womenkind of our 'brave defenders.' I wish you to nnderstand that it is not only those women whose marriages were not sanctioned by the regimental authorities that suffer. I know an instance of a woman with seven chUdren (on the strength of the regiment) who one day had for dinner one pennyworth of potatoes and a halfpennyworth of greens. She would have starved over and over again had it not been for private charity. She has an exceUent character. Tho cause of her poverty is that which influences aU those that are destitute- viz., stoppages on account of raüway and other expenses. Women are living in piggeries, in cupboards, and washhouses, and in ????? of the most wretched description. We have endeavoured to amend this state of things, but the number of poor is too great for us to grapple with. The great causes of aU this distress »re stoppages of the soldiers' pay, and consequently of the pence thatwould otherwise go to the wife (30 young married women, without chitaren, are absolutely Uving upon Id. a-day ')-married men messing in camp-the inaptitude of the bish to such Ubour as wffl remunerate in such a town as Colchesterdearness of fuel and lodging. Cause of aU-moving the depot and charging the marned men with the expense of moving their wives, and throwing these into a town where thereS a superabundance of labour. Remedy.-Pay back the stoppages, furnish the wretched people with old stores (they sleep for the most part in straw), and send down some hute to place them in. The Rev. James Round, the Rev. Mr Lock, the Rev. Mr. Owen, the Rev. Mr. Curtis, the Rev' Mr. PoUexfen, and myself constitute a committee to try and do something for the people, and Mr. Hulcatt, the Chaplain to the Forces, is worked to death ln supplying the wants of the numerous appUcants. I brought the matter bofore the magistrates 14 days ago, and a report of my sayings was in the local papere. Mr. Lock; the rector of St. Botolph's, Colchester, wffl send you a letter, addressed to you at the House of Commons, which will certainly astonish those who beheve they are making the soldier a respectable, moral. »nd religious member of society. We want money for thé sext fortnight for absolute food and clothing." He hoped the Secretary for War would state whether it was the intention of the Government to adopt any measures for the relief of this destitution. Mr. F. PEEL said instructions had been given to General Gascoigne, at Colchester, to furnish a report as to the cause and extent of the destitution which was stated to exist among the famiUes of married soldiers at the camp there He (Mr. Peel) could not enter into the particulara of this case, but he would say generaUy that he did not think it would be advisable to grant relief under such circumstances from army funds as distinguished from the ordinary sources of reUef. The adoption of such a course would establish a most inconvenient precedent, for whatever was done at Colchester must also be done at Aldershott, at the Curragh, and wherever camps wore established (some cries of "Hear, hear"), and the regulations of the army respecting the marriage of eoldiers would be virtually abrogated There was now no reason why soldiers should marry during the penod of their service in the army. (Some ironical enes of " Hear, hear," and laughter.) They now enlisted only for a penod of 10 years, they might generally quit the service before they were 30 years of age, and he thought the regulations at present in force respecting their marriages might very properly be maintained. BULETING TROOPS IN SCOTLAND. In reply to a question from Mr. Cowan, _ Sir G. GREY stated that danses would be introduced into the Mutiny Bül to give effect to the resolution adopted by the House last session on the subject of buletine troom in Scotland. ^ The motion for the adjournment of the House to Mondav was then agreed to. ·* NEW WRIT. On the motion of Sir W. Jollote a new writ was ordered for NprthLeicestorshire, in the place of the Marauis of Granby, who has succeeded to a seat in the House of Lords as Duke of Rutland. WAYS AND MEANS. THE BUDGET. The order of the day for going into Committee of Ways and Means having been read, Mr. GLADSTONE presented a petition from a committee of West India planters and merchants, expressing the sur prise and disappointment with which they had learned the intention of Her Majesty's Government to propose the con tinuance of the war tax upon sugar. They represented that u the proposal should be agreed to they would be subjected to serious loss, that the suppUes of sugar would be dis couraged from coming to this conntry, and that the sugar* market would be annuaUy disturbed for a series of years· They therefore prayed the House not to adopt the scheme of the Government. On the question that the Speaker do leave the chair Mr. DISRAELI rose and said,-Sir, before the House proceeds to consider in committee the financial arrange ments of Her Majesty's Government I ask them to adopt the resolution o£ which I have given notice. ? offer. ing some statements and arguments to the House which I hope may persuade them to adopt that resolution' it is my intention, so far as lean, to conduct the discussion in that temperate spirit which I think discussions of this nature essentiaUy require. This is a financial debate, and so far as I am concerned I shaU not introduce into it any topic which may in any way lead the House to depart from the consideration of those financial details which are now before us, and a sound judgment upon which appears to me to be of the utmost importance to the community at large. We have, and always shaU have, great differences of opinion in this House on poUtical subjects of importance, whether foreign or domestic. I dare say that differences of opmion wül always exist in this House as to the manner in which our foreign rektions shaU be conduoted, and there wiU ??? be differences of opinion upon subjects such as that which occupied our attention Ust evening-namely, as to what classes shaU be the depositories of poUtical power in England ; but there is one question upon whioh there oughfc not to be a difference of opinion in this House-namely, the importance of maintaining our finances in a wholesome condition, and of taking care that the Government of the country do not impose taxes which are unnecessary. Now I willingly and at once approve tho course which has been proposed by Her Majesty's Government with regard to the war income-tax. Since I have devoted attention to the subject I have always considered that the existence of thaiimpost involved a pubUo grievance. Considering the SrCw·^^ the V*0*1*« ^scon^sul ported the Mnustry during the Ute war.-considerinsX generous and almost Uvish manner in which theTpCed their resources at the disposal of thè Goverment intnlt arduous struggle ? ??? ifc ^ ^g^ great poUtical nustake if the people had discovered that they wore saddled with a heavy burden which did Tot in its ongrn como from their own freewill, and ^7hich according to their understanding, had been obtained almost by» elencai error m an Act of ParUament. I have no doubt the people of this country are prepared at aU times to endure such burdens and to make such sacrifices as they think are necessary for the publio advantage ; but if
they make » sacrifice they require-and I think it is not «»reasonable they ihould require-that at least they sh»U make it of theirownfree will, and that it shaUbe an aot of their spontaneous devotion. Now, when we doubled the income-tax to carry on the'war there is no doubt that the whole community heartily acceded to the proposition. Theyagreed to double the income-tax in order to carry on the war, and they consented that the inoreased impost should continue for a y ear after the war had ceased. That was clearly understood throughoufthe country, and by aU classes ofjthe community. The language by which that burden was entailed upon them for another year was introduced into an Act of ParUament of comparative insignificance, not into that by which the tax was doubled, and it certainly was not at the time understood by the great body of the people that tho consequence of our legislation would be, not merely to double the incometax, but to enforce that double tax, granted for carrying on the war, for two years after that war had ceased. When the people discovered this they were surprised and indignant· and it became, in my mind, not a finanoial but a poUtical question-a question whether it was poUtic to aUow the disposition of the people, which during the war had been so admirable, to be soured by such! circumstances, and whether, if we continued pedanticaUy to adhere to the letter of the bond, we couldin future emergencies appeal to popular feeling with equal success. Considering that this was a poUtical and not a finanoial question, I deeply regret that Her Majesty's Ministers should have permitted that agitation to exist whioh in the autumn did prevaU upon this subjeot. I know it may be said that ParUament was not sitting at the time, and there was, therefore, no means of communicating to the country the disposition of the Government to evince their sympathy for the spirited manner in which the people had supported them in the war by conceding to their request of exemption from this doubled tax. But, though Parliament was not sitting, there are other means of communicating to the country the intentions of the Government ; there are means either by a speech or by a letter, by whioh we know that pubUo opinion can be tranquillized or can be agitated, and I regret very much that Her Majesty's Ministers did not think it consistent with their duty to communicate to the pubUc during the autumn the intention whioh they have since announced in ParUament. The noble lord the First Minister, for example, went down to {Manchester because he wished to express to the country his opinions npon an important poUtical treaty. The noble lord might, when this agitation had assumed a disagreeable character, when not merely a grievance was complained of, butthe very principles upon which the tax was to be continued were discussed, have avaUed himself of similar machinery, and have oommnnicated the determination of the Government to redress this pubUc grievance. However, we were disappointed in that respect. There was another opportunity at whioh that communication might have been graciously made ; that was at the opening of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) I think it would have been most gracious to have announced in the speech from the Throne that this grievance should be redressed. That opportunity also was lost ; and in consequence I myself announced, on the first night of the session, that I ehould ask the opinion of the House upon the subject. I mentioned then what I now say, that I considered I was dealing with a strictly poUtical question, and not with a financial one, that I beUeved there was a great pubUc grievance whioh ought to bo redressed ; and that I thought it advisable and proper that the redress of that grievance should take placo immediately after ParUament assembled ; and that, as the Ministers themselves did not offer such redress, I thought it wa3 consistent with the duty of a member of ParUament not connected with them to make the attempt. In so doing it was not my intention to interfere, nor did I consider tha* I in any way interfered, with the financial arrangements of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer. I did not ask him for his budget; I did not ask him for his estimates. If the Government had, on my motion, taken the opportunity of announcing their poUcy with respect to this grievance, they would not have been pressed for their financial measures · they might have brought them forward after the expiration of an interval of a month from this time. However, those measures »re before the House, and it is necessary that we should calmly and accurately disouss their effect. Sir, I have no wish at any time to indulge in prospective finance. I agree that I' is more convenient, I should say most convenient, in dis" cussing the financial position ofthe country to confine ourselves to the current year, whose fortunes we are endeavouring to Uy before the House. (Hear, hear.) But, on the present occasion, if I indulge in prospective finance, I must remind the House that I am commenting upon a statement which is, in its charaoter and provisions, essentially prospective. (Hear, hear.) It is not I who have introduced the prospective element into our debates upon this subject ; it is the ChanceUor of the Exchequer himself, who has brought before the House a prospective budget founded upon another budget eminently prospective-viz., that of the right hon. gentleman the member for the IJniversity of Oxford (Mr. GUdstone) for the year 1853. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer, the other night, did not confine his ken to the commencement and end of the ensuing year. On the contrary, the right hon. gentleman, not only upon that, but also upon another occasion, sketched the position of the Exchequer with regard to finances for a period of three years. On Friday night-the night on which he made his first and principal statement, the right hon. gentleman summed up his views under the name of his ·' plan," and said, " If my plan is adopted I shall be able to do this and that and other things in the course of the next three years." The right hon gentleman did more than this. His plan is prospective, not merely as regards his schemes, but also as regards our pockets; because he proposed new taxes which are to be levied for a period of three years, and which are even to vary during [that space of time. Therefore, those who should find fault with the motion which I am about to introduce to the notice, and I hope to the acceptance of the House, on the ground that it interferes prospectively with the finances of the country-though I- do not suppose that upon mature reflection such an objection wffl be urged-must have forgotten the budget of the ChanceUor ofthe Exchequer, and the nature of the financial arrangements which we now have to discuss, It is, I repeat, the ChanceUor of the Exchequer who has, by what he calls hi, "plan," introduced the prospective element into our discussions, and it is utterly impossible to form any opinion upon the arrangements which he proposes ; it is utterly impossible to offer any criticism upon the schemes which he has submitted to our notice, unless we consider their bearing not merely upon the present year, but also upon the subsequent years before the period arrives when as we had hoped, the income-tax was, according to the arrangement of 1853, entirely to cease. Now, Sir, I have two general objections to offer to that plan upon whioh the right hon. gentleman diUted on Friday evening. I think that the inevitable consequences of that plan wül be to cause financial embarrassment, and to render the remission of the income-tax in 1860 not merely difficult but absolutely impossible. These are the two great objections which I entertain to the financial pl»ns of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer, as eUborately described to the House on Friday night. Now, with the permission of the House, with very Uttle appeal to figures, and that as succinct as possible, I wffl endeavour to show the grounds on which I intend to support these objections. I have at this moment very Uttle comment to make upon the estimates of expenditure and income which the right hon. gentleman offered for the year 185758. I do not now want to inquire captiously into the accuracy or wisdom of those statements. The House wül recol. leet that the right hon. gentleman estimated the expenditure for the year 1857-58 »t the sum of 65,474,000?., whioh wa4 to be defrayed by an income of 66,365,000!., leaving a surplus revenue of between 800,000?. »nd 900,0002. I do not, in mentioning this estimate, observe upon tho omission of provision for the Persian war. I wffl not dweU upon the fact that this country is at present at war with distant countries, but that in these estimates no provision is made for the expenditure to -which those wars wül lead. I am stffl willing to beUeve that we are to have peace with PersU, and that we are not at war with China. It is, of course, impossible entirely to shut out the knowledge of existing circunistances and the consideration of their influence upon our finances ; but I wffl, as much as may be remove them from the question, and wffl, if possible, confina myself to the financial facts and the finanoial speculations which have been introduced to the House by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer. In the year 18S7-5S, then, we are to have an expenditure of 6S,474,000£., with an income of 66,365,000?. The House wffl recoUect that one of the most important items of that estimated income accrued from the income-tax itself. The right hon. gentleman, besides the 7,000,0002. which he wffl obtain if we raise the tax 2d., wffl be in the enjoyment of 4,250,0002. sterling arising from the produce of the war income-tax. Now, Sir, having stated to the House the expenditure and income of 1857-58, I want to put before ifc »lso the income and expenditure of the year 1858-59, the second ? ear of the right hon, gentleman's plan. As regards the income, I have taken as far as I could the figures which were afforded to me by the right hon. gentleman. The House will understand that any Égares that I read, unless they have been furnished by the Government, I offer, of course, with diffidence; yet in my general conclusions I have given so Urge a margin that if my views are right in the mam tho results wffl not be affected by any inaccuracy on the score of figures. This,then, is my estimate for 1858-9, the second year of the right hon. gentleman's plan:-He wsfÍÍLw^.tbe estímated revenue from the Customs at ^'m ,llln.^e*ÍwÄtu>n apposed the duty on tea to be Is. 7d. perlb. msteadof Is. 9d.,tWate forthe current year ; c^ iÄnefdorthe &?.on refined sugar at 18s. 4á. per bUd uSr°L?^ But ? 1858-9 the *duty on tea will oe ¿a. less per pound, »nd that on refined sugar Is. 8d. less
per cwt. I, of course, have the greatest difficulty iu forming. an estimate of our probable loss on tea. »nd sugar, in the event of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer's proposition for 1858-9 being accented I therefore offer, unaffectedly, Tather » suggestion than a formal statement of figures ; but I have estimated that the loss may be on tea 469,0002., and on sugar 442.0002., making together a total of 911,0002, Itako the Customs, then, for 1858-9 at 22,339,0002?; the Exoia at 17,000,0002. (being tho figures of the right hon. ¿entuman) ; the stamps I take at the same »mount as in 1857-8viz., 7,450,0002. ; the Und and assessed taxesat 3,150 0002 · the income-tax, reduced to 7d. in the pound, I take åt 7,000,0002. ; the Post-office at the same sum as in 18S7 ?__ viz., 3,000,0002. ; the Crown Unds at 265,0002. : and the misceUaneous revenue at 1,200,0002, The total income from these yarious sources wffl be 61,404,0002. [The Chancellor of the Exchequer here made a remark impugning the accuracy of the right hon. gentleman's calcuUtions 1 I think that my figures wffl be found to be correct, but I shaU not stop to go over them again at this moment. Now for the expenditure of 1858-9. ? take the estimated charge for the debt at 28 550 0002. · This, of course, ought to include the interest ón thé whole of the war debt; but there must be deducted from this charge the interest on the 2,000,0002 of Ex chequer-bonds, amounting to 70,0002., which wül malT 2S,4b,0002 Next, I take th<> charge 'on the C^ZuS .bund at the same scale as in 1857-8-viz., 1.770 ???7 . «,« Army I take at 11,625,0002. : the navy at 8?09 0002 '· the packet service at 965,0002. ; the civü service at 7 250 00(17 · the collection of the revenue at 4,215,0002. ; andtosuner! annuations at 475,0002. This gives a total of 62 889 0002 ??°?.?^?,?^0 other aditional items, the first of which ? the 2,000,0002. of Exchequer-bondspayablein ????^ · and fte sum of 1,500,0002. for the sinkingfundin the^me'vMr ^SfÄK added *° ihe fonner total produce an ????????? of 66,389,0002. I ought to state why I rave taken thfannt the navy, and the cml services at the same figures astne Tight hon. gentleman reckoned them for the vearl857? 9 The right U gentleman when he mad^hTfinalui statement a week ago, in applying himself to the oÆcussion of the great estimates, entered into an eUborate argument to show us that no very considerable reduction could be looked for on these items. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQTJER,-That ís this year. B Mr. DISRAELI.-I beg the right hon. gantleman's pardon. He wffl have an opportunity of foUowing me in the debate, and it is not necessary that he should interrupt me (Hear, hear.) But, unfortunately, on Friday last thè wholw tenour of his argument was that on the whole of these items-the army, the navy, and the civU service-the increased charge was of a permanent character, because he compared the estimates of 1857-8 with those for the three years immediately before the war, and stated that the current year is the penod of transition from war to peace. The current year has witnessed a vast reduction in our expenditure. But, our present estimates not having been laid before us by the Minister of the Crown previous to his financial statement, I wffl take the Uberty of introducing them now in detaU, and show from analysis the excess of the present over the corresponding estimâtes in the time of peace. I wül prove, in fact, that there is no ground for reduction with the exception oi ono item, on wbich the right hon. gentleman laid very littlestress-and I beUeve rightly so-viz., the unfulfilled contracts. He analyzed the expenditure undersix distinct heads ¡and, thoughl wffl not weary the House with minute detail, I.mustrecaU this circumstance to the richt hon. gentleman's recoUection, to show that his arguments cannot apply to ?7-8, the ensuing year. Indued, thè whole of his reasoning tended to convey to us the impression that, exclusive of the unfulfiUed contracts-to which he attached but smaU weight-the principle of reduction could not be carried out to any appreciable extent. With reeard to tte navy, havmg given us five great items of excess, the nght hon. gentleman said that one of them was for an increase m the Marines and the Coastguard. This, he told us was the result, not of a war Act, but of an Act passed in tune of peace. He next informed us that the prize of pro%?°5S ÌI b'gb-one of the other causes of the increase · thirdly, that the scientific vote was also augmented ; that the fourth cause of additional expense during the ensuing year is the item of unfulfiUed contracts, which I have already mentioned. We have very recently obtained some information that wffl guide us in ascertaining the amount of the last-named extra charge, and we may, I «nnk, safely conclude that it will not be very considerable Then the nght hon. gentleman said that the vote for steam machinery and coal would be greater than before in consequence of the progressive introduction of steam power into our navv-that owing to this oircumstance we must lopk to an additional expenditure, permanent in its nature inen came the mcrease for the factories in which to repair ourmachinery.for enlarging our dockland for the extension of the packet service. Now, none of these items for next year, with.the single exception of that for unfulfiUed contracts, is for purposes of a temporary character. Therefore I do not suppose that the right hon. gentleman anticipated the ppssibüitv of making any reduction upon his estimates Continuing the line of remarkto which hehascaUed my attention by his interruption, and coming next to tho army, here again we had from him the same description of analysis And the House will observe, whether we look to the artülery branch, to the creation of new miUtary trains and a new hospital corps, tothe item of 225,0002. for warlike stores (the result of unfulfiUed contracts), to artificers' wages, or to education, works and buüdings, that the result ofthe analysis was that, in the right hon. gentlenw« opinion, reduction was not the means by which the finan ^MTrnlgenVent3 £vth·0 country c<mld be c»rried into effect. Therefore, I believe, I am perfectly justified in taking for the.expenditure of 1858-9 &e same estimates as he proposes for the ensuing year 1857-8, and in neither case adverting to the existence of war, or to the possibility of fresh misconceptions, which might lead to an increased expenditure. The consequence of that will be that, with »n expendituref or 1858-9 of 66,300 000/ and an meóme of 61,000,0002., vou wffl have ? anparent deficiency of about 5,000,0002. sterling. ThS. then, is the result of the second year of his plan.

Let us see what, if I «£ 5äí1S"lyÄlateOÍihe?onse<mence8 of the plan ofthe nght hon. gentleman, would be the wisest ar..:'most temperate course to adopt. H theHonse reaHy believes that we are menaced by t, deficiency, what can be more judicious than to proceed upon this exceUent principle of financewhich, indeed, must be the basis oí »U sound financial schemes-to adjust the estimated income and expenditure??" such a manner as is best calculated to prevent TdeSciW »ndthen, ? pursuance of a poUcy to which I beUeve thii House is pledged, to provideln ?? best manner we Z ? enabling Parliament ? the year I860 to remit the whole of ???????-ter,, as waspronüsed to the country in 185?! Thatis theobjectof the resolution which I placed on the table; but no soonerhadlgivennoticeof this resolution than amost extraordinary change occurredin the financial world. The nght non. gentleman the ChanceUor of the Exchequer was at the table-the House being in Committee of Supply -moving a vote to which there was no opposition, and he ÄrnÄ0 v ^oPrort^tytooffKÄoule I ?? tïLS ^ ^??01?1 ft»tement of the preceding Friday, introducing elements, in my opinion, entirely icoon«stent with the statements, argumenti, and'pUns which he ìnb?T»0n?1lhd **«>"«· I «a "ot complaining of this; the.rigiit hon. gentleman has» right, of cours!, to make two financial «tatémente if he chooses-there have been Chancellors of the Exchequer who have made even more (Uughter) ; I am only putting before the House » narative of these incidents. And what was the right hon. gentleman's statement of Monday night? It was apparently addressed to my resolution, which was then in the possession of the House. He said, very frankly, I own, " I can answor the motion of which notice has just been given at once," and, mentioning me, he said I seemed to fear a great deficiency in the years 1858-9 and 1859-60, but that there was in reality no fear of any suoh deficiency. "I wfflteUyou," said the right hon. gentleman, "what are my estimates of the expenditure for those years" (he might have told us on Friday, but that is nothing); "andI wffl teU you how I mean to meet that expenditure." The right hon. gentleman, with great frankness, gave us his estimates for those years, and they varied very slightly, but not in any decree so »? to »Sect my argument, from the figures which I bad assumed before he made that supplementary statement. leaving, therefore, if my first conclusion was just, on each year a vast deficiency. "But," »ays the right hon. gentleman, "there wffl be no deficiency, because we are going to adopt the expenditure of 1853-4" No doubt if the Government be going in 1858-59 to adoöt the expenditure of 1853, that is an important element m the consideration of the financial plan. (Hear, hear) But if that be the case, although I do not complain for a moment of the previous criticisms into which I have been betrayed by the right hon. gentleman making his statement onFnday-wbch I considered to be a statement of authonty-inconsistent with that which he made on Monday I «ay if that be the case, »nd if we are to take the statement of Monday, as I do without complaint, as the authentic statement, what are the irresistible inferences whioh we are to draw from it? ? the first place, one naturaUy asks if there is to be that vast reduction in 1858-9 which is to prevent these enormous deficiencies, what U the reason tüat tne reduction ??? not «ome effect in 1857-58» (Hear, hear.) Let us know wh»t »ro the causes which wffl enable the Government in 1858-59 to make *« Option of wbch, according to the representation of Friday, no hope was held ont for 1857-58. (Hear Tr° lì* ^Cv^TTr* ? íhe heads int» which ?? OnanceUor of! the Exchequer eUborately analyzed the estimates which had not been introduced by their respective Ministers on Fnday-if I go through his analysis of ? the causes of excess of expenditure in 1857-58 over 1853,1 cannot find-exeept in that poor item of "unfulfiUed contracta for which a Urge estimate, including gunpowder and timber,, would be 500,0002.-that any of tlem, bocord??.?7 J"8 ET3- worf¿ teless influentul in 1858-59 than in 1807-58. But now, after that statement of the right hon gentleman's, I want the House to consider this :-What would be tte effect if in 1857-58 the Government would do that which they-say they'are"prepared?&T1?"??8.?" to theHouse the effect of that upon our income Let me show------*l±±"~>= -"= *??» ? ?« upon our income and expenditure. We are to faU back in 1858-59 to the expenditure of 1803-54. Now, the gross expenditure of 185?·-54, ?? stated by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer on Monday, was 50,840,0002. Add to that the increased charge of the debt, 746,0002.; add the Ex. chequer Bonds to be paid off in 1857-58, 2,000,0002. : ^^otbe Sinking Fund for 1857-58, 250,0002, a¿d the total wffl be 58,836,0002. That is an estimate f oi 1857-58 drawn up on the expenditure of 1853-54, which is to be thé basis of 1558-59. Now, this is very important : »nd let me press it therefore upon the attention of the House. Having ???? Td ?*1?' we ffl^it have «? expenditure of 58,836,0002., let us see what the income of 1857-58 would be en the supposition that the income-tax was not increased beyond Sd., and that there was no increase in the tea and sugar duties. The income estimated by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer on Friday was 66,366,0002. From that deduct for the 2d. onthe inoome-tax, 2,000,0002.; deduct also the tea and sugar dubee, which I take at 911,0002, and we nave then the income for tha ensuing year 63 455 0002 against an expenditure of 58,836,0002, We tlms should have, according to the new position of Monday, a surplus at the end of the year of upwards of 4,000,0002. in the exchequer without adding any new taxes whatever, without increasing the income-tax, which ought to be only 5d. in the pound if we adhered to the old system^ and without adding to the taxes upon sugar and tea. The nght hon. gentleman, then, bythe statement which he made on Monday, has opened »most interesting subjeot of speculation which I am sure every hon. member must appreciate ("Hear," and a Uugh.) Now, how do we stand in this matter? because it is exceedingly difficult to deal with a financial statement which has apparently two colours and two forms and »spects. If the statement of Friday be the authentic statement, we are about to be landed in a great deficiency, and there is no hope whatever of seeing the end of the income-tax in 1860. If, on the other hand, the version of Mondajr be the orthodox version we not only got a reduction ofthe income-tax immediately, and we not only have no recourse to those indirect taxes which have created so much odium out of doors, and which are so much opposed here, but we have a fair prospect also of getting rid of the income-tax in 1860 »ltogether. But it is imposable that two results can be more different. (Hear, hear.) If we are to »dhere to the budeet of Fnday, its deficiency; if, on the other hand, we are to faU back, as we were told that we were on Monday, to the expenditure of 1853, we have before us the most rosy prospect, that a financial Minister ever introduced to the House oí Commons, especiaUy at the termination of a war. (Hear, hear.) I should think, then, that a debate upon the scope and tendency of these financuj, propositions isnot at aU irrelevant or unnecessary. Now, I Imo w it wffl be said that in the estimate which I have offered there is an element as regards the Ust two years of the right hon gentleman's plan, assuming that he reaUy adopts the expenditure of 18o3, which I have omitted j but I assure the nght hon. gentleman that I have not forgotten it. According to the estimate of income and expenditure for I85758 drawn up on the basis of the expenditure of 1853 I have shown to the House that without any increase of taxation whatever there would actuaUy be left in the exchequer a surplus exceeding 4,000,0002,-that is to say, that there would be left in the exchequer about that sum which the right hon. gentleman wffl obtain by that Urge portion of the war income-tax which is not yet paid. That is the exact sum probably which would be found as surplus in the exchequer Otherwise, without the war income-tax for 1857-58, the expenditure and income would exactly balance themselves suppose that you took the expenditure of 1853. The right hon. gentleman, however, may «ay to me, "But if you take the exnenditure of 1853 there is an item of vast ÎSS,T wnicnwill enter into the calcination of 1858-59 »nd 1859-60-which is not rnclnded in 1857-58-1 mean the charge for the sinking fund for the war debt of 1,500,0002. Therefore, if the income and expenditure of 1857-58 did balance themselves after that surplus derived from the war income-tax was deducted there would be a deficiency of 1,500,0002, upon those two years." WeU, Sir, I grant that. I grant if you established the expenditure of 1853 as the basis of your operations, and if you did aU that 1 have sketched out, that you would find a deficiency in consequence of the sinking fund for the war debt of 1,500,0002. for the last two years of the right hon. gentleman's plan. But remember that we shaU have in the exchequer a surplus of upwards of 4,000,0002. I do not mean to say that that 4,000,0002. can legaUy be applied »t the present moment to the Uquidation ofthe sinking fund, or even to thepaymentof the exchequerbonds of the Ust two years. The Uw respecting surpluses and balances is too rigid to permit of the ChanceUor of the Exchequer's applying it without appealing to ParUament · but see what the effect of the statement of Monday is ·- Here you can, by falling back to the estabUshments of 1853, carry on the affaus of the country without any new taxes whatever, and with a Urge surplus »t the end of the current year of upwards of 4,000,0002. in your exchequer ; but in the Ust two yearsof the right hon.gentleman'spUn there wffl ba a deficiency ? consequence of the action of » special sinkme fund for the Uquidation of the war debt. But when we recoUect that that Urge balance has been obtained by war taxation in a time of peace I do not see why the ChanceUor ofthe Exchequer, instead of imposing new and vexatious and odious taxes upon the peoplo, should not come forward »nd ask the House of Commons whether, in equity, that surplus of 4,000,0002. mightnot be appUed to the Uquidation of the -war debt. (Hear, hear.) In that case, according to the statement of Monday, the right hon. gentleman might carxy_ us through the three years of his scheme without in· creasing ant of our taxes, and might be enabled to deal with the income-tax by the aid of the terminable annnihes and euch other means as might then providenbaUy anse. (Hear, hear.) What a different plan has the ChanceUor of the Exchequer »dopted! The ChanceUor of the Exchequer, in this state of the finances, comesì forward and proposes new taxes. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer enters into an essay as to the comparative mente of direct and indirect taxation-» barren «ubject for this House and the country, for, whatever thoir relative mente may be, it is clear that our revenue must be derived both from direct and indirect taxation, »nd thit we must appeal tp both to a very Urge extent. But the Chan· eeUor of the Exchequer finds himself in this position, accord·
ing to the Friday view, that he comes forward to propose the most odious of direct taxes »nd the most odious of indirect taxes. (Cheers.) Sir, with regard to the incometax, I am. not one, to show that this House wffl resist » fair introduction of direct tax»tion in our system, but direct taxation has never taken. » more intolerable form than in the income-tax. (Loud cheers.) It has been condemned by the voice of the country and the decision and il?? °»nîTî(5°USU }^^. enter into tho catalogue ? « í enormities-teat it is unjust, unequal, andinquisitonal. There are very few^ho have listened to moNvho have not had personal proof of these qualities. ("Hear " and a laugh.) These are grievances wbich are kot tobe bornein time of peace and with the income-tax as apormanent feature of our national system. In a national emergency these grievances are not felt. At such » moment private grievances,aro absorbed in pubUc patriotism, and no one thinks of ite injustice, its InequaUty, and its inquisitonalness, if he beUeves that the honour or existence of the country is at stake. (Cheers.) In such an emergency no one cnticizes the tax ; but just in proportion as it is exempt from criticism at a period of publio danger, the moment a penod of tranquillity returns you wffl find a re-action of odium to that degree that the tax is, perhaps, more criticized than it deserves. (Hear.) But the result is that the income »nd property tax is the most odious form of direct taxation, and I protest against that easy mode of argument which prevails, and whioh holds that any person who opposes the income-tax is opposed to direct taxation. (Hear, hear.) When I oppose it it is as the most odious form of direct taxation. Then, what ig the main article of indirect taxation upon which the ChanceUor of the Exchequer is going to inflict an inposf? Sir, if there be one article more than another which, m my opinion, tho ChanceUor of the Exchequer ought not to interfere with it is, the tea duty. (Cheers.) I do not say this for the convenience of debate or of ParUamentary combination. I despise and repudiate such ideas. When I had an opportunity my views on this subject were sufficiently shown. I had not the glory of carrying the reduction of the tea duties, but »s the organ of Lord Derby's Government I was the fet BntishMinister who tried to grapple with that question. (Cheers.) I therefore express the deep conviotion of my own mind on the subject, and I say that tea is the very last article that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer ought to have dealt with, and that the most odious of direct taxes and the most odious of indirect taxes are not the source» of revenue that ought to have been selected when in the face of the papers I referred to to-night it becomes »matter of controversy whether any new taxes at »? are PSHaaZL ((????4 Îdeedi « »ppears to me, from the ChanceUor of the Exchequer's statement of Monday,which 1 take from the observations of the right hon. gentleman to be the authontative one, that we should waste our time in cnticizmg the former budget. WeU, then, if the ChanceUor of the Exchequer has reallydetermined tofaU back on the expenditure? of 1853, there is no. cause for any new taxes «t all. Now, Sir, I know that some gentlemen are very muoh aUmad at the word "reduction," and, Sir, unquestionably rash and precipitate reductions, aiming at no precise object. and founded upon no precise information, are the most dangerous courses to which ParUament can ever have recourse and ought never to be sanctioned by this House. But, on the other hand, it is certain tbt wise reductions, aiming at distinct and practical objects, »nd founded upon ample ¿nd authentic information obtained by experience and researoh, are measures which, of aU others, deserve the respect »nd »PProbataon of Parhament-»re the measures of all others whichit isnot.oply the privilege but the duty of this House to »ustain and originate, and are the measures of »U others which are most entitled to pubUc approbation and gratitude. (Cheers.) When some gentlemen, therefore, are alarmed at reduction, I am surprised, and I am tempted to recaU to their recoUection what is the reduction which appears to ternfy them. ? 1852 it was my lot, as the organ of the Government, to accept the estii mates prepared by our predecessors at the moment wo succeeded to office. In tte course of a few months circum.ttances were very much changed. There were many considerations of an alarming character. The poUtical horizon ÎÏ^Îrtl· There wasgreat »Urm? the pubUc mind that the defences of the country were not sufficient. We had to consider that difficult question, and, although our Government was weak, we resolved to come to Parliament with supplementary estimates, the principal object of which was to secure that this county should have an efficient navy and an efficient ordnance. We came to ParUament-not be it remembered, to a friendly Parliament-hut on our renre«entations Parliament instantly supported us. I believe I may, say that the moneyj intrusted to us was skilfully and efficiently employed, and I beUeve that no money ever voted byPailiarnentwasmoreskUfuUy and more efficiently employed. Witness what took place in our navy and iá our artillery. But the necessary consequence of the supplementary estimates of the Government of Lord Derby was that when we retired, from office our successors accepted entirely the policy which we had originated in improving the defences of the country-* poUcy whioh they completed m a manner that was deserving of «? praise. More than that, they enlarged those supplementary estimates, and the consequence of Lord Aberdeen's Government following that poücy was a stffl greater inorease of the estimates The estimates mounted after us to ????? than 2,000,0002. The House wffl remember that when the ChanceUor of the Exchequer talks of reduction he talks of reducing the estimates not even to what they were in the time of Lord Derby's Government. He is not going to reduce them to the sum they »mounted to after they were increased by the sup. plementery estimates. Sir, J hope that hon. gentlemen on both sides wffl well consider this question of reduction. We havebefore us several very singular precedents upon which the House of Commons has acted on this subject I need not dwell upon what took placo in 1816, although it may be weU that hon. gentlemen should remember those circumstances. You had a King's speech in which the estimates were described by the Ministry as having been prepared with the utmost regard to economy. The income-tax was then ten per cent. The country gentlemen came down to ParUament, and protested against the income-tax. It was the country gentlemen who mainly terminated the mcome-tax in 1816. (Hear, hear.) It was not, however, merely tho country gentleman who protested nor wa3 it the precipitate action of men who acted from thé impulse of the moment, and noi from thoughtfulness. The income-tax was opposed by many eminent merchants of the day, and also by th» greatest merchant that EngUnd perhaps ever had,-Mr. Baring, the Ute Lord Ashburton. (Hear, hear.) He took the most decided course on the subject. He was a man of singular ingenuity, but of a prudence amounting to timidity. He was of all other men most deeply interested in the maintenance of the pubUo credit of thu country. And what did Mr. Baring say? Mr Baring said, "??? must terminate this income-tax entirelyyon must listen to no compromiso," for the ???????? of the Exchequer of that day was prepared to accept a reduction of the income-tax to ? percent. As to any plea in excuse for the income-tax that there was a teU of expenses left by the Ute war, " beUeve me," said Mr. Baring, "that if you listen to that'tale'it wffl never disappear.^ (AUugh and "Hear hear.") Let the House remember what that war was and what was the position of Great Britain, The battle of Waterloo had only been fought a year before, France was occupied by our armies. We had increased the national debt during the previous 12 months 67,000,0002., and yet, under these circumstances, Mr. Baring was sanctioned and supported by the country gentlemen of EngUnd in demandfag the aboUtion of the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) On that occasion Mr. Barinp declared" That it was impossible, as long as Ministers could show any tail of the war expenses, that they would give it up If they could once get the tax fixed in time of peace the? wouldgain their object, andnota member of the House would see the end of it. No one who had the least experience of the conduct ot Government could doubt that, instead of producing redemption of debt, it would produce wasteful establishments and extravagant expenditure. It would only be by ridding the country of the tax that Ministers would be induced to practise economy." Are not the opinions of such a man to have their influence onus? (Hear, hear.) What happened? On the 25th of March the House throw down the ?????-tax. In May the ChanceUor of the Exchequer came forward with a new budget, and it was found that we could get on extremely weU without this 16,000,0002. of taxation. (" Hear," and laughter.) That is a very striking historical instance familiar to the House,; but there is another instance that occurredin our own tíme-an instance which very many now sitting in the House must have been witnesses of, but which I am sorry to, say almost every gentleman has forgotten. So vast and rapid have been the events of modern times that the recoUection of what occurred in 1848 with respect to taxation in this House has been entirely obUteratod, as I learn from the personal experience of many of its mombers ("Hear," and a Uugh.) bi 1848 there was a defioit. The poUtical horizon was very cloudy, and the chief Mimster of that day came forward, not trusting, if my memory be correct, even his ChanceUor of the Exohequer to make the financial statement, but lending to it »if tho authority of the Premiership and tho First Lord of the Treasury. He told the House that there was a defioit, and that the stato of affairs demanded that they should bo vigUant »nd watchful. He then proposed that the income-tax of 7cL should be raised to Is. Now, that was no sUght proposal. Fivopenco did not then bring 5,000,0002., for my Irish friends had not then the opportunity of contributing to the Exchequer through this medium (Uughter); but they wiU perhaps permit me to say that if they support the financUl proposition of the Government they may rest assured they will have to pay it for many a long year. (Cheers and laughter.) The Government of 1848 wanted to get 3,500,0002. additional into the Exohequer, and their proposition was to raise the income-tax to Is. "what happened? Why nobody listened to it. (Laughter.) The Government wore told that if they wanted 3,500,0002., they must find it somewhere else. The noble lord (Lord 3. RusseU) withdrew his proposition, and he got his 3,500,0002. in another way. (Hear, near.) That was another instance in which the Honse and the country by their determination prevented an increase of the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, I am for wise, not wüd reduotion. (Hear, hear.) I am for reduction with » definite object, founded on definite knowledge. I do not want to confine my criticism to the mUitary and naval estimates. There is another branch of the estimates which I think might be subjected to wholesome criticism. Let us examine those estimates. Don't let us attempt to do anything that would frighten the "oldest inhabitant" from his finanoUl propriety. (Laughter.) We are proposing no measure which wiU be hostile to pubUo credit"; but, to my mind, we are taking a course which wffl confirm pubUc credit, and which will not »dd to the burdens of the people. (Hear, hear.) Lot us do as our predecessors did in 1816, and as we ourselves did-though we had forgotten it-in 1848. (Hear.) Let us support the ChanceUor of the Exchequer in his wise poUcy of Monday. Let us forget that awful budget of Friday, which has frightened the isle from its propriety (" Cheers," and Uughter.) Let us dismiss from our minds ant increase of income-tax, »ny increase of the tea duties. Neither appears to me to bo necessary. (Hear, bear.) The ChanceUor of the- Exchequer h»s now got upon the right rail, »udwe sh»U support him in the policy which, "better late than never," he has now adopted. (Hear, hear. ) Bat, is this change in the policy of the Minister any reason why I should change my resolution ? My resolution appears to me to bo peculiarly necessary to the position in which we find ourselves. We don't wish to express any »ant of confidence in the Governments which, as we heard yesterdiy, would be likely to alarm some very influential members of
^^>T,nÆ»d°*°itWa^to.>blhe «overnment out of tho hands of the Administration, and give it to a P.rliII mentary committee. Th»t » » course wfiich I wluld never recommend. I don't wish to see » select cZmttte? taking, oreven sharing, the responsibUity of the???«??3!?? (Hear, hear.) Letui therefore, car7y out tbk ^w?"*' Uch'ltHÁlaysdoVn thorigOncfpVZ Ä'oS finance should always rest- the fundamental »nd ¿«!??? poUcy of finance to which this House shonld ever »ahm,let us require that, before we take into consideration, or rather beforo we sanction, the financial arrangements of th« Government, we must have the estimated income and ex penditure adjusted in the manner that wffl appear best calculated to secure the country against the risk of » de" ficiency. (Hear, hear.) Surely, that is the principu on which wo ought to »ct, remembering that what I h»ve said is the cardinal financial poUcy of this House and the mode best calculated to throw by in ,1860, without financial embarrassment, » baUnce which wffl »How the entire remission of the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) I think that isa resolution which the Government may accept, and «UI shaU do will be to ask them to act upon it. If they wffl act upon that resolution, if thev will reaUy adopt the policy which on Monday appeared to be m the ascendant, and take the estimates of 1853 in the manner then set forth, I, for one, have no wish to embarrass tho Government acting in such circumstances. (Hear hear.) If I s»w a bona fide determination on the nart of Government to carry such a policy into effect, I would even counsel those whom I might be presumed to influence to offer some assistance to the Government in those circumstances,-I should not çare even forthe first year-thoneh I think.increased taxation is unnecessary-and would In ready m some degree to give my assistance to the ?°veÍSment m ???? »n enterprise. If wo «aw that in 1860 we were to get rid of the ??«»?? if we saw that there was to be no considerable permanent inorease of the duties on tea, I would be disiraeOo^nake some sacnb.ee, to meet the convenience ofGovernnient, [Hear. ) But if the policy of the Government is tHe-trgf though we may make sacrifices by this increase of direct'and inject taxation,, we are only in the end to be Unded in a deficit, then I think the House of Commons cannot too speedily and decidedly interfere to prevent a result sa calamitous. (Hear, hear.) In the belief that if the House wffl sanction this resolution we shaU be »ble altogether to avoid new taxation by wise »nd| weU-considered reductions, I now place it m your hands, »nd commend it to the imparbal but earnest consideration of the House of Commons. (Loud cheers.) The question having been put, The CHANCELLORof the EXCHEQUER said,-Considenng that when, on the first night ol the «ession, th3 right hon. gentleman gave notice of » motion on the income-tax, he had evidently considered the subject with great deUberation,-considering that although he announced his intention some days afterwards to persist in th»t motion he has since aUowed it to disappear f rom the notice list-I considering that the motion now before the House is a motion substituted for the one originaUy presented - and considering :that the right hon. · gentleman, who holds so eminent a position in this House »nd is ?? experienced in financial affairs, has, we may assume, thoroughly investigated the matters Upon which he has spoken, I cannot, Sir, but congratulate myself at finding thathe has offered scarcely any objectioato that whioh is, properly speaking, the finanoial pUn of the Government. (Hear, hear.) With the exception of » few remarks upon the »bsence of estim»tes of the extraordinary expenses of the Persian war, »nd also of what he thought fib to caU tho Chinese war, and some general remarks upon the odiousness of an income-tax and the odiousness of a tax oa tea and sugar, I do not remember that the right hon. gentleman introduced into his address a single observation bearin» upon the financUl plan of the year. With regard to the want of an estimate of the expenses of the Persian war I have already stated that we shaU present one, and I faeluded in my statement of Friday Ust a sum of »bout 260,0002,, which we estimated would be the amount of the first portion of the extraordinary expenses of the expedition that we should have to defray. It is, therefore not correct to say that there is no estimate of any portion of those expenses. What the right hon. gentleman calls the Chinese war. has been carried on by vessels upon the station, and no extraordinary expenses which we could Uy before the House have hitherto been incurred. As to the right hon. gentleman's general declamation on the subject of the income-tax, I think, considering the number of years during which that tax has now existed since it was proposed for the second time by Sir R. Peel-years of peace as weU as of war-that the House wffl hardly expect that I should enter into a formal dissertation as to the poücy and necessity of that tax under certain ciroumstances. (Hear.) With regard to the tea and sugar duties, which the right hon. gentleman declares to be the most odious of imposts, IreaUyamat a loss to know upon what ground they are to be so designated. Mr. DISRAELI.-Only the tea duties. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER._For » long time tea Mid sugar have been included among the articles upon which a Customs' duty has been levied, and the duty is not subject to the objection of being a protective duty. inasmuch as these articles are produced exclusively abroad(Hear, hear.) They are also »rticles of general consumpp tion, but they occupy a position somewhat above that of mere necessaries, such as bread and meat, »nd for » series o, years they have been regarded as proper subjects for taxatíoaI am therefore at a loss to know why the right hon. gentleman should stigmatize the duties upon tea and sugar [Mr. DisraeU 'repeated that he had only mentioned the tea. duty] pecuUarly odious, or why he should condemn me for having selected as an object of taxation an artide upon which a greater »mount of duty than isnow to be raised has in tíme of peace, up to the present period, been levied for a long series of years. I must assume, then, that the financial plan of the year, or the budget-that term being confined to the estimate of expenditure at first submitted to the House in Committee of Supply, and to the estimate of the ways and means provided to meet that expenditure-having been placed before the House, the right hon. gentleman can scarcely make any objection to that budget, and I may regard myself as fortunate in having escaped almost entirely from his censure. (Hear, hear.) But in the excursive flights which tho right hon. gentleman took over the regions of finance he was not satisfied with remarking upon the estimate of revenue and expenditure. for the year, but he commented upon the plan which I proposed of fixing the taxation for two additional years. I may, perhaps, remind the Houõe of the constitutional practice with regard to the determination of revenue and expenditure. The expenditure of the country is partly fixed by Act of ParUament-that is, it partly consists of the Uiterest upon debt payable by Act of ParUament, and of charges upon the ConsoUdated Fund fixed by Act of ParUament ; and it partly consists of annual votes in Committee· of Supply. These two branches of expenditure are now about equal, the amount payable in the present'year, under Acts of ParUament bemg about 32,000,0002., and" the amount voted in Committee of Supply being also »bout 32,000,0002. Itis possible, when the estimates are Uid on tho table, when a plan of expenditure is proposed upon the responsibUity of the executive Governmentto the House, to form a financial plan or scheme of revenue and expenditure for the year, and that is what I and aU persons in my position have done. But I wül venture to say that no Finance Minister upon any occasion ever presented to the House a plan of expenditure ¡for any future year. (Hear, hear.) Such a thing is perfectly unheard of. The great majority of taxes are fixed by permanent Acts of ParUament and levied from year to year until Parliament thinlcs fit to get rid of them, and other taxes are fixed foraperiod ofyears. Formerlythere werecertain annual duties, such as the sugar duties, but they have nowbeon discontinued, and at present aU taxes are fixed for a perpetuity or for a period of years by Act of ParlUment. I thonght it my duty to propose, finding that the tea and sugar duties and the income-tax wore continued for a certain timo, that certain alterations should be made in the rates of those duties and of that tax. The income tax waslimited to continue for three years, and I proposed simply to alter the rates of tho tax during those three years. The tea and sugar duties were to faU by reguiar gradations to a certain amount, and were to be fixed atthat »mount. AU th»t I did was to propose certain alterations in these duties, but I never submitted to the House a pUn of expenditure for a future year-for any year beyond¡the present. (Hear, hear.) Neither on Friday when I first addressed the House on this subject, nor ort Monday, when I gave an explanation supplementary to my former address, did I attempt to give any estimate of ex penditure for a future year (hear, hear) ; «nd if the right hon. gentleman wffl look at the statements of former Finance Ministers,-forjinstance, at that of|Sir R.jPeel when he intro. duced the income-tax, and at those of the various ChanceUors of the Exchequer who have renewed that tax ho wffl find that on no occasion did they attempt to give an. estimate of expenditure for more than one year. Therefore when the right thon, gentleman talks of a "deficiency»' he introduces an idea whoUy foreign to the subject. (Hear, hear.) In. order that there should be a deficiency it is necessary that there should be a comparison between revenue and expenditure, and if I had made an estimate of expenditure for future years, and had compared it withthe revenue, and the right hon. gentleman had .henfound there was a deficiency, he would, nodoubt, have been justified in saying that I had created, as lie caUel it, a colossal deficiency; but I never asserted that the changes of taxation I had proposed would create either a deficiency or a surplus. (Hear, hear.) On tho first nigìit that I made a statement I abstained from aU mention whatever of future years, but on Monday, when the right hon. gentleman bad given notice of the motion he has no w made, I thought it Would be convenient to the House to know what was the revenue which I calculated for the two years to which that motion referred, »nd I accordingly read »n estimato of that revenue. The totals of that estimate were not stated by the right hon. gentleman exactly as I stated them. The totals which I stated were 62,300,0002. for the
year 1858-9, and eïAOOO1, for the year 1859-60, andlsaid tUt it you compared that revenue with tho expenditure Ot the year 1853-4 you would find no deficiency. That was thestatement I made, taking the Ust year before the war ss Ä Standard of comparison, because, if I had taken as my Standard the estimated expenditure of the present year, ? should have taken an estimate whioh has not been agreed to by the House, and which, moreover, rebtes to a year of great peculiarity-the first year after the war. However, any non. gentleman may make the comparison for himself, either of the revenue, suoh as I have stated it, with the expendi. ture of the present year, or of that revenue with the expenditure of 1853 ; but, whatever year may be taken as the standard oí comparison, I must be understood as declining to make any positive estimate, or to give any opinion as to the amount of expenditure of any year after the present. With regard to the argument of the right hon. gentleman that there wül be a great sum, which wUl acoumuUte, to be defrayed in the year 1860, by which the difficulties of repealing the income-tax wffl bo inoreased, I wish to call the attention of the House to a few remarks. At the same time IJ do not undertake to make a budget for more than one year. (Hear, hear.) I express no opinion whatever as to the probable expenditure for a year after the present Nevertheless, I ehall.take a general view, so as to throw some light on the possible financial position of the country iu the _ two foUowing years. The revenue estimated for the year 1858-59 and 1859-60 is, as I have already stated, abou? C2,300,0002. I hold in my hand a statement of the gross revenue of every year since 1830. There is cnly one year from 1830 up to 1853 in which the income exceeds 58,000,0002. The revenue which I have provided resulting from the alterations of taxation wffl be at the lowest 62,265,0002., being nearly 4,000,0002. greater than that of every year prior to ÎSU4-55. Since 1854 the revenue has been 64,000,0002. fo 1854^5, and 70,000,0002. for 1855-56. In the present yea the revenue wffl »mount to about 71,885,0002. The revenue Ior next year is estimated »t 66,365,0002., being the yea 1857-58, for which I propose the present budget. Then w a come to the years 1858-59, when tho revenue is estima'ed at 12,300,0002., and 1859-60 »t 62,265,0002. The question is whether » probable income of that amount wffl be insuJïïcient for the expenditure of those two years. Notwithstanding tua disapprobation of the right hon. gentlemen, I must again be aUowed to institute a comparison with the expenditure of the year 1853-54. The expenditure then was 55,840,0002. The revenue proposed to be raised in each of these years is 6,460,0002. in excess when compared with that expenditure-that is to say, the income of the years 1858-59 and 1859-60, as compared with the expenditure o 1853-54, shows a surplus of 6,460,0002. We must consider in a ParUamentary point of view what may be regarded as the first charges on that income. I wffl at once asnme that, looking at the importance of our national de fences, the expenses for the army and navy wffl be the first charges. Comparing the estimates of the present year with the estimates of the last year before the war, there is an ex cess of about 4,000,0002. We certainly cannot reasonably anticipate that excess should continue at its present amount. (Hear, hear.) Some portion everybody wffl admit um^° lta being the "r** Tear after a war. (Mr. DisraeU - The second year ; that is important."]· It is the first yeir after the disbanding of our armies, and after the retnm of our army from foreign parts. (Hear, hear.) Unques °Jj ? ^eat diffioult;yis experienced in making redactions suddenly in the army and navy, and in mUitary and naval establishments, and we must consider that a large portion__ I wffl not say how large, but a large portion-of the present excess is due to the peculiar circumstances of the present year. What reduction we may be able to make in future years is a matter on which I can now express no opinion. It wffl depend on many causes, many of which, no doubt, are within the control of tins Houso, but inasmuch as wo havo not yet been into Committee of Supply, and the estimates have not undergone any debate, it would be premature to offer an opmion as to the extent to which they may be susceptible of reduction in future years. That they wffl admit of reduction to a greater or less extent I deem absolutely certain. (Hear hear.) We then come to the estimate for the Civü Service' and I confess that offers greater difficulty in reduction than the army and the navy. This has been owing to thegreat increase which has taken place of late years in that branch of expenditure, so that now the estimates for the CivU Service amount to rather more than 7,000,0002.-that is to say, the? exhaust the whole of the income-tax at 7d. in the pound (Hear, hear.) At the same time, the House should bear in mind that a sum of l,2i,O,OO02. has been transferred from the Consolidated Fund to the annual votes, which is a transfer of expenditure, not an increase and merely appears under a different head. But, Sir there has been of late years a great increase m der this head of charge, owing in a great measure to the policy which has been received with so much favour in this Houso, and particularly found advocates among hon. gentlemnn opposite, of transferring charges of a local nature to the national exchequer. (Hear, hear.) As it is a matter of some importance, perhaps the House will allow me to state to them a series o£ items of this character which are now charged upon the civü estimates. There is the item of criminal prosecutions in England formerly paid out of the county rato, 250,0002.; the same for Scotland, 12,0002. ; maintenance of prisoners in the united kingdom, 126,0002. ; Poor Law charges, 118,0002. ; county constabulary, 146,0002. ; the same for Ireland, 644,0002 - making altogether in reUef of local rates, 1,297,0002. There has been also a transfer to the civU estimates of an item of 216,CC02. from local fees in County Courts. Theieisalso a charge, which must be considered in the nature of reUef to local expenditure, for education in Great Britain loi?ÍUtlliVear amonnls to 528,0002., and for Ireland to 181,0002. The branch of science and art takes 45,0002., and these three items make together 755,0002. The total of items of this class is 2,320,0002. That is a branch of expenditure which has been growing, and is stül on the increase, and in the reduction of which any executiva Government wül find itself comparatively powerless. The next charge whioh will come upon those years is the charse for debt. If the revenue should be found insufficient, after defraying the service of the year, to defray the repayment of debt charged by law on those years, it wffl of course be open to Parliament when that time arrives to consider whether any other arrangement may be made for the discharge of that obligation. I should be extremely sorry if 1 thought that anything would interfere with the payment of the four series of exchequer-bonds which stand for payment in the present and the three succeeding years. At the same time if it should bo found that they can only be paid by imposing on the country taxes of a very onerous description-if the financial pressure is severe- of course it wül be open to the Parliament of the day to consider whether the burden can be distributed over a greater number of years. At the same time my hope and conviction is that it wffl be possible to defray them in tho years when they fall due. (Hear, hear.) But with regard to the sinking fund which is due in the same years a"different reason applies. I ought, perhaps, to explain to the House the way in ? hieb, that sinking fund originates. Tho sinkiDg fund for the three loans of 6,000,0002., 5,000,0002., and 5,000,0002. was made to commence in the same manner as the income-tax was made to cease-that is to say in a year after the 1st of April succeeding the ratification of a treaty of peace. That was the case in the first two loans because they were contributed in the course of tho war.' The third loan was contracted after the war, and therefore a definite period was fixed for its payment. When the first and second of these loans were contracted tho duration of the war was quite uncertain. It might have lasted 5 or 10 years. If it had lasted for any period of that sort, it would have been impossible to pay out of the annual revenue the Exchequer Bonds that would have become due during its continuance, and it would have been absolutely necessary to raise new loans for their discharge. But as the war happily lasted only three years, it so happens that the firs-t payments out of the sinking fund upon tho three loans fall m the same j ear as the Exchequer Bonds; and heneo arises a groat accumulation of the redemption of the debt iu those three years. The House wül observe that the amount to beiedcemcd in the present yearis 2,250,0002. In each of the two next years tne sum wiU be 3,500,0002. It would be a perfectly legitimate financial operation, if ParUament should think fit to do so, to postpone that sinking fund for three years. The only effect of such postponement would be that the first loan, for example, instead of being paid off in 1873,would not be paid oü ??1876, and so withregard tothe other two. It might be found desirable to adopt that cour-e for when so large a sum as 3,500,0002. is to be redeemed within a year, and that redemption takes place by the purchase of stock by the Government, they raise the price of stock as against themselves, and the redemption is therefore effected on unfavourable terms. I havo not stated the full extent of the redemption of debt which would be goin» on in those three years. There are now annual payments upon terminable annuities to the extent of about 4,1.00,000'. Now, the annual charge of these annuities, if they were'mado perpetua!, would be 900,0002. The difference, therefore, in the three years between tho oharge upon those terminable annuities and upon them if converted into perpetual annuities would be 9,300,0002., which represents with tolerable accuracy the annual extinction of the debt. And, therefore, if in thoso three years the whole of tho debt represented in the return which I hold in my hand were extinguished, together with the pavment of the terminable annuities, wo should redeem 18,550,0002. of the debt at tho end of those three years. I have explained to the House thafcl did not undertake to make a budget forthe next two years, and that, according to any reasonable computation,of expenditure, and also making allowance for those legitimate arrangements which may be resorted to with regard to the redemption of the debt, if Parliament should so determine, there can bo no ground, as far as we can judge, for anticipating that financial embarrassment (involving a deficiency of 5,000,0002.) in a future year which the nght hon. gentleman has depicted in such alarming colours, and which he says would render tbe extinction of the income-tax impossible. I have, I trust. LbVb ?- >?'?^?? »e right hon. gentleman's speech wbch consisted of a demoUtion of an imaginary fabric.viz., tbe balances in the next two years between revenue and expenditure upon which I had reUed, together with an imaginary deficiency-is whoUy founded on error and on a misapprehension of the very elements and conditions of the question. Can it be said with any truth that I have opposed any additional or artificial obstacle to the extinction ?£ the? income-tax in 1860? I think I can conyince «ie House that so far as I have done anythine m that respect I have rather afforded faculties for its extinction. 1 have merely proposed an addition to the income-tax for the present year, whioh the right hon gentleman himscU not only does not object to, but of which he says we have » right to avaU ourselves. I have proposed that the income tax for the two next years shaU be Yd. instead of 5d. in the pound, and I think that that U Ire no means a burdensome increase. An income-tax of Id, in the pound would be 8s. 4d. per cent., and therefore the addition of 2d. in the pound to 5d. wffl only add 16s. 8d
per cent, to 22. Is. 8d. per cent., thereby making the percentage of 22. 18s. 4d. That addition, I think, cannot be regarded »s a very heavy burden upon any scale of fortune. So far as the «hange which I propose in the income-tax makes any difference, it provides an additional revenue for thoso two years. And the same is the case with regard to the tea and sugar duties. At present those duties are upon a descending scale. I propose to arrest that descent, and, therefore, so far as those duties »re concerned they will tend to increase the revenue for the two next years. The change which I propose, so far as the remission of the income-tax is affected, manifestly faoüitates and does not obstruct. ( Hear, hear.) Then with regard to the provision which may be made for the discharge of the debt in these three years, if that debt should be discharged to the extent of 9,250,0002., the reduction of the mtereet m 1860 compared with the year 1857 would be 313,0002. I may, perhaps, be Uable to the charge of attempting to penetrate too far into the future if Ï read to the House an estimate which I have prepared of the revenue in 1860-61. The revenue of a future year can be estimated according to the existing Uw ; but it is otherwise with regard to the expenditure, because it depends upon'the annual estimates which are prepared by the Government of the time being, and have to be submitted to ParUament. When, therefore, I make an estimate of the expenditure for 1858-9, for example, I can estimate that portion of the expenditure which is fixed by Parliament such as the annual charge in respect of the ? ·?solidated fund; but aU the rest of the estimates must necessarily be framed upon mere conjecture. Supposing, then, that no alteration shaU be madetffl the year 1560 in the taxation which I have proposed, I estimate the revenue of the year 1859-60 at 62,265,0002. There would be a loss in 1860 upon the tea »nd sugar duties (even taking into calculation the increased consumption in that year) of about 1,065,0002. There would also be a loss upon the income-tax of 3,650,0002., becausethe payment of half of tho sevenpenny tax would faU due in the foUowing year. In respect of misceUaneous I estimate a loss of 100,0002. The total loss, therefore, to the revenue in 1860-1, compared with that of the previous year, would be 4,815,0002., and the revenue in 1860-1 would be 57,450,0002. If we add for improvements and other branches of the public revenue an assumed sum of 665,0002. we get »total of 58,115,0002. The expenditure of 1853-4 was 55,840,0002., which we may take as a standard of comparison, approving it or not as we think fit. I deduct from that sum the difference between the interest of tho debt in 1861 »nd the interest of the debt in 1853-viz., 1,640,0002.-which is formed by deduoting from the terminable annuities, which expire in 1861, »nd which »mount to 2,146,0002., the additional oharge of interest which has accrued during the war. The expenditure of the year -assuming always that of 1853,-is thus reduced to 54,200.0002., as against an income of 58,115,0002. The House may take that estimate for what it is worth. I have expressed no opinion upon it, and refer to it merely for the purpose of showing that the pUn I proposed does not throw any obstacle in the way of the extinction of the income-tax in 1860. With regard to that question I feel myself incapable of assenting to the latter part of the resolution before the House. It says that it would be expedient to " provide for such a balance of revenue and charge respectively in the year 1860 as may pUce it in the power of Parliament at that period, without embarrassment to the finances, altogether to remit the income-tax." I do not in the least deny that it would be extremely desirable to realize that result. AU persons must wish that any onerous tax, which the income-tax is aUeged to be, should, by the increasing prosperity of the country, be found unnecessary f or the pubhc service. But it seems to me that we cannot bind ourselves down to any sort of pledge, or to »ny formal confession of faith as to the possibfflty or probabfflty of ParlUment being able to remit the income-tax in 1860. (Ironical cheers and laughter from the Opposition.) Each gentleman may calculate the, probabUities for himself, and if we choose we can abstain from taking any measure whichmight. render such remission of taxation either difficult or improbable. What I maintain is, that the proposal which I have made, so far from increasing tho difficulties, mitigates and lessens them, and offers every reasonable prospect which we can hold out at present of a satisfactory financial adjustment in 1860. (Hear, hear.) Beyond that point it appears to me impossible to go. If the state of our finances in 1860 should admit with advantage of the remission, wholly or almost entirely, of the income-tax, let us trust to the wisdom and patriotism of ParUament in that year to effect the change. (Hear, hear.) If, on the other hand ; it should turn out, from adverse circumstances which we cannot without the gift of prophecy foresee, that the aboUtion of the income-tax is impossible, we should only create disappointment and weaken the respect in which the Parliament is happUy held if we led the country by an abstract resolution to expect a remission which circumstances might put beyond our power to grant. (Hear.) Therefore, although there is Uttle in the general tenour of the resolution to which I have to object, I cannot see that any advantage would arise from our assenting to i1·. It would be open to much misrepresentation, would give rise, perhaps, to dangerous misunderstanding, and therefore I shaU vote in favour of the Speaker leaving the chair. I shaU neither affirm nor deny the resolution, but shall ask the House to pass to the order of the day and go into Committee of Ways and Means, with a view to consider to practical question of tbe reduction of the war rate of the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) The resolution can lead to no practical result. It can produce no effect beyond that of a certain quantity of discussion in this House (" Hear, hear," and a laugh) ; and even if we were to bind ourselves down to this sort of political test, ï cannot -understand how wo should be nearer than we are now to the attainment of the end which the right hon. gentleman opposite and aU of us most have in view-viz., the permanent and satisfactory settlement of our finances. (Hear.) So muoh for the latter part of the resolution. The former part seems to me, so far as I can apprehend its meaning, to be equaUy objectionable. It asks the House to resolve that "it would be expedient, before sanctioning the finanoial arrangements for the ensuing year, to adjust the estimated income and expenditure in the manner whioh shall appear best calculated to secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in the years 1858-9 and 1859-60." I confess I am not quite clear as to the meaning of that paragraph, by which I apprehend the right hon. gentleman means-and perhaps he will have the kindness to correct me if I misconstrue the words-that we are to adjust the estimated income and expenditure of the years 1858-9 and 1859-60 in the manner which shaU appear best calcuUted to secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in those years. I wffl assume that that is the meaning of his resolution. Mr. DISRAELI.-I beg to say that that is not its meaning. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-Perhaps the right hon. ¡¡entleman will explain what he does mean ? Mr. DISRAELI.-I thought the wording of the resolution was extremely clear. When 1 ask the House to resolve that it would be expedient, before sanctioning the financial arrangements forthe ensuing year, to adjust the estimated income and expenditure, I do not refer to the estimated income and expenditure of the years 1858-9 and 1859-60, but aUude particularly to the estimated income and expenditure of the present year. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-Then what the right hon. gentleman proposes is, that we should adjust the estimated income and expenditure of the present year in such a manner as should appear best calculated to secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in the two foUowing years. (Cheers and laughter.) I confess I had somo difficulty as to the construction of the terms of his resolution, but I was rather desirous of saving his logic at the expense of his grammar. (A Uugh.) The right hon. gentleman, on the other hand, appears to wish to sacrifice is logic and save his grammar ; for by what process of adjustment of the income and expenditure of the current year we,are to guard the country against the risk of a deficiency in the two foUowing years I am at a loss to imajiine. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman is perfectly aware-he stated, indeed, in the course of his speech-that by law the commissioners of the national debt are bound to apply to the reduction of the debt the surplus of each separate year ; and therefore if there were a surplus in the present year it could not be handed over to supply the deficiency of subsequent years, but must be exhausted within the current year. (Hear, hear.) But, assuming an adjustment of the estimated income and expenditure of the ensuing year to be expedient, how is it to be carried out? I do not think that a discussion such as that of to-night is Ukely to have a very adjusting effect. (A laugh.) The House itself cannot undertake the adjustment of the income and expenditure, and if that duty is to be performed in a workmanlike and efficient manner the right hon. gentleman must move the appointment of a select committee. There must be an " adjustment committee." I presume the first step would be to refer the army and navy estimates ; the civü service estimates would follow, and so the process of adjustment would proceed through alt the items of income and expenditure. Judging from the progress whioh former committees have made with simUar inquiries, I think I might ventuieto predict with considerable confidence that the report of the adjustment committee would not be presented much before tho end of the session. The last committee upon the estimates sat two or three sessions · but, giving the new committee credit f or extraordinary dffigence, industry, and research, I think we could hardly expect their report bofore the end of the session. Even then, however, the process of adjustment would not be completed! because the House itself would have to consider and, if possible, agree to the report, and aU this before the financial arrangements for the ensuing year are sanctioned. Meanwhüe, what would happen to the income-tax ? By law the war income-tax is continued for another year. Unless some Act of Parliament to the contrary be passed by the Legislature before the 1st of April next, the coUection of the tax must continue. WeU, then, whUe the right hon. gentleman's committee was adjusting taxation the taxpayer would [be paying his war ninepence up to the end of the present session, and thus the process which is suggested for the relief of the taxpayer would be found a principal means of aggravating the burden of the taxpayer, I trust, then, that, upon a consideration of this resolution and oí the effect it would have as regards either the adjustment of income and expenditure or the question of the extinction of the income-tax, the House wffl see that no practical benefit can result from its adoption, and that it wül agree to the motion which I had the honour of making that the Speaker do leave the chair, and that we enter at once upon a consideration of the resolutions relating to tho income-tax and the tea and sugar duties, and that we commence at once a revision of the taxation of the country in reference to its altered position by a transition from war to peace. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman having resumed his seat, a sUght pause ensued, during which cries of " Divide ! " and " Question ! " were heard. The SPEAKER having read the resolution, Mr. GLADSTONE rese and said,-Sir, I have been under the beUef that the question raised by the budget of Her Majesty's Government would excite very great interest in thisHouse. I am stffl impressed with that beUef, bnt per. hape the reluctance of hon. members to address the House may be intended to convey to me that they have a right to bear my sentiments upon this question. There is no man In this House who is so deeply concerned In the question
which is now raised as myself. I have itood at that table »nd h»ve addressed the House of Commons, »hdlhave received on the part of the Government to which I belonged the assent of the House of Commons to financial plans which are in every point contradictory to those which are now proposed. (Hear, hear.) How it is tbt hon. gentlemen still setting on those (the Treasury) bonches find » facility for giving assent to contradictory propositions it is not for me to say, but of this I feel convinced, that if Imay assume to exist in thu House of Commons the same feelings which existed four years ago-I do not mean as to questions which were the subject of party contentions, but as to the duty of balancing income and expenditure-if we respect the express pledges which were given to the country on the subject of the income-tax (hear, hear)-if this House which I now address be the same House which then accepted the propositions of the Government when we held out certain expectations to the people of EngUnd, when with those expectations we imposed the income-tax upon the people of Ireland (hear), when we obtained an opportunity for the settlement of many difficult and thorny questions on account of the expectations so held out (hear hear)-if thij be the same House of Commons, stül governed by the same motives, stffl sensible of the same obligations, then I feel a great confidence in the vote which this House wffl give upon the present occasion. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend who has just sat down has, I »m bound to say, in the speech he has deUvered entirely, candidly, ingenuously corresponded with the description I have given of his financia! plan. Everything for which we have been Ubonring during the Ust 15 years is, I do not say destroyed, because the destruction of the results of 15 years' labour is not the work of a single day-but everything in regard to finance for which we have been labouring during the Ust 15 years is in principle condemned »like by the speech as by the plans of the right hon. gentleman the Ch»nceUor of the Exchequer. Why, Sir, for several years before 1841 it was the misfortune of this country that there arose a series of deficiencies in the levenne. We recoUect what it cost us to repair ???? deficiencies. Wo thought that from that time the principle had been established that it was the first duty of the House of Commons to provide a revenue adequate to meet the demands of the public service. (Hear, hear.) We wül aee by »nd by what are the views of my right hon. friend upon the subject of the baUnce of income »sd expenditure. We thonght we had been simplifying and consoUdating our financial Uws. Upon three separate occasions-in 1842, again inl845, and in 1853-with the general assent of ParUament -for it was no party question-great efforts have been made by successive Governments to consoUdate our financial Uw3, and we removed from onr Customs' tariff more hundreds of »rtioles th»n I dare venture to mention. By that means we «et a great portion of our trade entirely free, whioh I believe has been the main cause of its subsequent vast expanden. (Hear, hear.) But what says the ChanceUor of the Exchequer î Does he. approve that simplification? No; but he ??? done this-he has disinterred old Arthur Youn» (a Uugh) ; he has brought Arthur Young before us, and Ar° thur Young says that to load an infinity of articles with taxes infinitely smaU is the perfection of finance. ("Hear," and a Uugh.) That, however, is a total condemnation of the Ubours of Parliament during the last 15 years. (Hear, hear.) In 1853 this House gave its solemn assent to this principle-that the income-tax, whUe it continued in a time of peace, if it was to continue at aU, should be continued for speoial purposes (hear, hear)-namely, for the purpose of introducing great improvements into our financial system, of relieving the mass of the people from heavy burdens Therefore, although the tax in itself was grievous, inquisitorial, unequal, a tax which it was desirable to get rid of yet ParUament agreed to tolerate it for a further time, but only for that one purpose (hear), which mitigated the recollection of the hardship of the tax by assoemting with it a recoUection stffl more pungent of the blessings to be wrought out for the mass of the people through its instrumentaUty. (Hear, hear.) What has become of that principle in the hands of the right hon. gentleman the ChanceUor of the Exchequer ? With what benefioial change does he propose to assodate the continuance of the income-tax ? (Hear.) My right hon. friend has not avoided the subject'. His candour and ingenuousness fobrade him to avoid it He scorned to escape it-he discussed the subject of indirect taxation-he knew there were three matters respecting which much f eeling prevails in the country as to the expo. diency of the existing law. The right hon. gentleman knew there was the tax on paper, which it is urged is not only a heavy burden upon literature, not only a burden upon the manufacturers, but a restraint upon the extension of rural Ubour, to which the manufacture is so weU adapted. (Hear, hear. ) He took the tax upon insurances, whioh is a scandal to England. (Hear, hear.) He took also the tax on wine, which he knows to be the greatest impediment to our enlarged intercourse with France ; and how did the right hon. gentleman deal wiv.h those subjects ? How does he propose to assodate the continuance of the income-tax with the recoUection of a benefit conferred ? He said that the duty on paper was not a bad duty, that the tax upon insurances was a good one, and as to the duties on wine he would disouss them another day. (" Hear," and a Uugh.) I ask, then, whether I use the language of exaggeration, or the Unguage of truth, when I state that my right hon. friend has completely in his speech thrown overboard, condemned, repudUted-as far as the aot of one year can go-principles of finance which were introduced amid dUfioulties and struggles, which were first extensively appUed when the party opposite was in power, and appUed with the general approval of that party, as weU as of the party on this side of the House. With respect to aU those things my right hon. friend-I wffl not say destroys aU the benefits which have accrued, for as yet he has only had one opportunity to practise his hand, but he has done pretty weU, and I am certain that if the ChanceUors of the Exchequer who may succeed him should foUow his example, or if he himself continues to Ubour in his vocation as sedulously in future years as he promises to do in this, and if those labours should obtain the sanotion of the House of Commons, at the end of the next 15 years you wffl find but few reUcs of the great efforts and great achievements of the last 15 years. (Hear.) To pass from the speech to the Budget, I am sorry to find that, owing to what circumstances I cannot teU, it has been made the means of propagating throughout the country a series of impressions as to matters of fact which are totaUy unfounded. I am quite sure it wasnot the intention of the righthon. gentleman to produce any such effeot, but I am quite as certain that such effects have been produced, and that the production of them is owing to the inadvertent use he has made of figures in his statement. The impression that has gone abroad is, that 11,970,0002. of taxes are to be remitted We are told that about 9,000,0002. of the income-tax is going to be given up for the year 1857-8, and that after these great operations there wffl remam a surplus revenue of 900,0002. Notwithstanding aU this, there is to be no departure from the expectations held out to tho country with respect to the cessation of the income-tax in 1860 ; but, on the contrary, wo are going to make a new affirmation of them by passing a resolution to the effect that the grant of 7d. in the pound on incomes shaU be for the term of three years and no longer. Now, I beUevo (and I hope to be corrected if I am wrong) that these are the exact impressions as tothe character of the budget now before theHouse which were propagated on Friday night, and which since that night have by means of the pubUc journals passed throughout the country. Now, I venture to say that not one of these assertions is true. (Hear, hear.) I do not speak now of matters of argument, I speak of matters of fact, and I say they are not true. I take the first statement of my right hon. friend, when he gave ?? a Ust of faxes about to be repealed, though he did not teU us of any taxes about to be imposed-an omission much to be regretted. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer told us that 11,970,0002. taxes were to be repealed ; and I think I am right in saying that it is the almost universal beUef of the House that we are now going by our own acts to extend that amount of reUef to the country for the year 1857-8, and stffl to retain a surplus of 900,0002. Am I not right in that ; because if the found» - tion is cut away from under these financial pUns the whole of their merits are cut away ? We must see what we are going to do, and what we propose for the future after the proposed repeal of taxation. Now out of that sum of 11,970,0002. there is a very Urge portion the repeal ot which does not depend on any proposal of the Government or act of ours. (Hear, hear. ) When war taxes are granted they are invariably granted by the ParUament for the purP'ses of war in time of war. Thus the war-tax on malt yielding 2,000,0002., has lapsed by Act of Parliament On coffee 135,0002. is Upsed by Act of ParUament from the 6th of April next. In Uke manner the war-tax on tea of 6d. in the pound has Upsed, causing by Act of Pariiament a boon to the country of 1,588,0002. írom the bt of April next. The war-tax on sugar of 2s. Id'. (taking brown sugar) lapses from the same date, making a reUef to the consumers of 755,0002. That is to say, there are several sums, amounting to 4,470,0002., the repeal of which the people ought not to owe to the grace or favour of either the Government or the ParUament in the present sesssion but which disappear in virtue of the operation of tho Acts whioh granted them for the war. (Cheers.) To begin with that,-is not that a considerable hole to make in my right hon. friend's promised repeal of 11,970,0002. of taxes, the grace, beauty, and virtue of which repeal was, we were told, to attach entirely to the votes we should be caUed on to give m the present session î (Hear, hear.) So muoh remission as I have stated was already enacted by Acte of Parliament, but what are we caUed on to do? It is here that the great misapprehension Ues. It is beUeved bythe
««fSïlSï ? ??· bfwed-and it is stfll believed to a very Peatextentbythis House, that we »re going to graat the rJïïîSS °¡ bT·T?· of the income-tax%ppgUcaollto the ?w«ÎSmSiît4 that "í** hwin? ???? that remission there wffl stffl be a surplus of 900,0002.

Now, let my chaUelge be dear ÎIX^&b!rT !'u1 endeavour not to be ambiguous. I iryi£ì ·*ne «oyernment are not giving away 9,000,0002. of the mcome-tax for the year 1857-8.

But I do not »dmit the surplus of 900,0002. The right hon. gentleman haVnot ? ?°?? ? T?rS-'ïïn have to vote for tbe two wars in the East. (Hear.) With, respect to the Persian war, he confines himself to covering the expenses of last year, and does notion ?? to yoteany mpney for its charge in 1857-8. If there be any life m the House of Commonslany sense of ite constitutional duty-it wffl not aUow the Persian war to be conducted on those principles. (Cheers.) I give the fullest notice that I do not understand it to be the function of the representatives of the people to aUowwars toba begun by Government, to be carried on by Governili nt, »nd discussion evaded, until after the conclusion °f thi iTaS ?«??«?(;4? ????? be presented, and we shall be told after blood has been sned and money «pent, that we have nothing to do but to consider the payment. (Hear, hear.) I wffl not conform to such an estímate of ?? duty of the representatives of thepeople: «nd if the House shaU be of the same determination as myself, we shaU have to invite, and if invitation does not do, then to urge or coerce the Ministers to submit the estimates of the Persian war, so that we may try them before, and not after, its conr-lnmnn So far from thnkmg 900 0002. a surpla s7m, XchTis immodest for my nght hon. friend to ask, I think it is a sum extremely, narrow for his purpose. I cannot think it a surplus which is bonafide avaUable : for, without asking any question about the liquidation of the Sound dues or in leference to the civü service of the country, I see pUinly, with two wars going on, we have two operations in progress tLír.0IQ°7Ä8afmt0f 90°'000?: ?^· therefore, ¿snort thatll,97o,000Z. of taxes are not redeemed, that 9 000 0002 of income-tax m 1857-8 are not remitted by these proposals, that a surplus, of 900,0002. does not remain 4 tbese proposals, and with regard to the question of whether the ?????-tax uto end iu 1860, we wffl inquire alhttle about that by and by. So much with regard to the description .of, the budget of Her Majesty's Government, and to the remissions which my right hon. friend proposes to make. The nght hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, in the speech which he has addressed to the House to-night, spoke of the difficulties attendant on prospective finance. No doubt those difficulties are serious. I myself am the person prindpaUy responsible, perhaps, for having proposed m the Éouse of Commons, on ifche part of the Government of 1853, a pUn which inVolved much of prospective computation; and I beUeve I was justified in propounding that plan, regard being had to the circumstances under which it was proposed ; but tlri^IA ^t ?p' r ib was Propose by a Government and accepted by a Parhament, and especiaUy as it was »c. ?epted by the Parfiament in which wTare now duTuls&g the budget of 1857, it is a great deal for my right hon. toni to say that you had no means of estimating tie revenue and ?^??-^?? *?"% i^y ri8ht h»11· «end was not ? the Government orín Parliament in 1853, and he did not recoUect the seventy of the censure he was bestowfaK on his present coUeagues; that almost every man whotìte bende him on the Treasury bench gave mì a cordial^»nd generous support in 1853, and that in that year we did pretend to form an estimate of the revenue and expenditure, of future, years. It won't do after that for my right hon. friend, who is the organ of the Government, but-not the Government itself,-above aU it won't do for this House, who made themselves in »great degree responsible for that plan of prospective computation, to say now, "We can present a£ estSato of the ??????? ti futureyears, but asto the expenditure of future year? that is altogether beyond our control.» (Cheers ) We "î^.^T^ whelber the proceedings of 1853 were reasonable and bond fide proceedings. If they were reasonable we ?*? t& by -them· °r t0 ^ how far « shaU bl justified by what has since occurred in departing from them! One word with regard to what foUowed'the proceedings of 1853. Had I been capable, for the sake of any temporary advantage, of comingdown to this House and proposing the financial arrangement of 1853 at the cost of future yeafs! I shonld have been the veriest charUtan and the West swindler that ever stoodat the tableofthis House. (Cheers!) Now, at the close of 1853, although the expenditure wai swelled to the extent of at least half a inUUon bTsJml S^rnS^I ?????§??1,?'-there was sT » surplus of 3,000,0002., and in contem plating the expenditure of 1854. had it not been for the war, we could have calculated on a surplus of nearly 2,000,0002. So far! therefore, as the ordinary circumstances of the coimtry would have influenced the revenue and expenditure, the expectations which were then held out would in all prebabihty have been realized . It is plain that these considerataons reduce our dutv within very narrow Umits. Owduty isto inquire candidly and dispassionately into the inter IS6 urS^ÍT8 il 0rder to see what amount of additional difficulty they have imposed upon us, and then to consider whether the difficulty so arising out of those intervenmgcircumstances is or is not sufficient to absolves Endam? Ärlw T rtuaUygavet0 the people lf England. (Cheers.) I say the ciroumstances which have intervened wffl not suffice to absolve us from that pledge! It is perfectly true we have had difficulties to contendati! which were due to the war.and some increase of unavoidable charges. My nght hon friend estimates the additiona! charge on the debt at 1,250,0002. ; but he says, yluhave not only incurred a new-permanent charge in the shape of debt, but. you have likewise abandoned a good ?. of revenue since 1&3. He gave the sum of 765,0002. as the »mount of taxation abandoned since 1853, which he afterwards reduced to 470,0002., and he contends that we are worsened suice 1853, not only by the new debt wnich has ??-?1 T*£' buí 4 the 470'000?· of Permanent revenue which has been abandoned. I reverse altogether the state" ment of my right hon. friend, and I contend that we have 2ÍWírVM*iS^nc^but have .Med to the permanent revenue since 18o3. He appears altogether to Eve overdnt'Viif0^^ thelpiritdutfes. He samhe produce of the spirit dubes was 1,500,0002., but from tbt item you must deduct 436,0002., the sum imposed in 185? which leaves 1,064,0002., and from that »Sin, Ü we subtract 470,0002., the amount said to have been abandoned, we then have an absolute exceslof ?£ since 1853, or, in round numbers, 600,0002. ?-year. That fft,·» £ »e additional charge on the debt of l,2o0,0O02.,. would make the real incrlase of permanent burden since 18o3 656,0002.

Iavaü mjself, therefore, of this opportunity to give notice that before ypu. Su-, leave the chair to go into committee of T??, it is my intention to propose a motion to the effect that, ? order to secure the country that reUef from taxation which it justly expects it is necessary in the judgment of this House to revise and further to reduce the national expenditure. (Loud cheers.) I have no right to claim authority in matters of finance. ?? that I have to claim is this-that the earnest application of my mind is to form a conscientious judgment upon the prospects of the country, andm the exercise of that duty I must state that I have never known a time when the finanoial prospects of the country-mixed up as they now »re with poUtical affairs, and with the pledges and proceedings of the Administration-presented »n appearance of so much difficulty. In my opinion a most arduous task wffl be imposed upon! the Ministers of the next five years in providing a balance between revenue »nd expenditure. Is the House reaUy aware of the rate at which, and of the mode in whioh the expenditure has been growing? I won't now enter into details. If I lwethe opportunity it wül be my duty to do so on some future occasion, «nd then it wffl be for Parliament to consider whethor Her Majesty's Government have fulfiUed their special obligation of controlling the expenditure of the country »nd checking the House of Commons when it shows *n undue disposition to expenditure. I wffl, however, state «ome facte which are summary and succinct. From 1842 to 1853,-during 12 years of constant improvement «nd continued social proiess -such was the »dministration of your finances that the expenditure of the country underwent no increase whatever I^nomcreasowhatever, because theamount is so trivialthat ? ^lTÄ^iSe-JEn 1853 the expenditure exceeded that of 1842 by 234,0002., »nd if you take the ??? 18o¿, which was not an inactive year in point of expenditure, you will find that the expenditure was positively less than it was in 1842. Since that period a ch»nge has p\ssed over the spint of our dream ; » ch*nge has passed over the temper of the Government, over the temper of the departmente, oyer the temper of the House of Commons, and over the temper of the country. Don't let us «eek ic7 shift the blame from ourselves. I believe that, in a great degree this change is the natural and necessary result of war! (Hear, hear.) If we were beings governed by pure reason, then no doubt it would be justly argued that in time of war, when enormous demands are made upon the public purse to meet the necessary purposes of the pubUo service, we ought at aU events to exeroise a peouUar economy In all the ordinary departments of that service. Butthe case is practicaUyjust the reverse. You contract a habit of extravagance. (Hear, hear.) War of necessity means reckless expenditure. It is useless to compUin of it ; nay it is almost vain to attempt to control it. Nothing worth naming can be done; butthe civü expenditure of the State »nd the temper ofthe House of Commons are infected with S"3 °???> °í extravagance, and see what is the result. From 1842 to 18o3 you discharged your duty-your first duty-as stewards of the money of the people of England, by giving them an account which showedthat, notwitbstanding the growth of popuUtion, the extension of trade, »nd the ore»tion of » multitude of new pubUc services, they were yet served at no greater cost than was thrown upon them 10 years before. What is the case now? Why the esbmates of 1856-7, as compared with the expenditure of 1853, show an augmentation of 7,000,0002. (Hear, hetir ) In 12 years you have a growth of 234,0002. ; in four years you have a growth of 7,000,0002. (Hear.) It is true that some deduction must be made from this amount, for we now include in the accounts of revenue and expenditure the charges for the coUection of the revenue. (Cheers from the Ministerial side.) A sum of 900,0002. out of the 7,000,0002. may, I suppose, fairly be put down on account of the increased cost of the coUection of the revenue. Part of that charge wffl, I hope, disappear with the return from a war to a peace income. Another portion of it is reproductive, but after striking off the charges connected with the coUection of the revenue you have yet a hard increa e of upwards of 6,000,0002. in the permanent expenditure of the country. ??? find an increase of 3,600,0002. in the müitary estimates, 1,750,0002. in the civil services, and the remainder-»bout 750,0002. in the additional charge for interest. This is a state of things which ?????? in my mind the most serious reflections. I »m quite persuaded that these facts are new to the country. (" Hear," and cheers.) The popuUr mind has not realized to itself the faot that upwards of 6,000,0002. have been added to the reguUr expenditure of the country-quite apart, as I shaU show, from the expenses of the war-in the short space of four years. It is time we should bethink ourselves wh at measures we are to take in order to discharge our duty as stewards of the money of the people (cheers), unless, indeed, we are prepared, according to tbe recommendation now before us, simply to shut our eyes and rush forward in the dark without mquiring whether there is before us a precipice or a plain. (Hear, hear.) I shaU not enter further into details on the subject of expenditure. In my opmion there is nothing more unfair than to press a Government in point of taxation, and at the same time to encourage them in expenditure (hear, hear) ; »nd as I am now soUciting the Houso to vote that we shall have no deficiency, so I intimate my readiness to contribute my humble part towards avoiding a deficiency by endeavouring to procure a further revision of the ostimates which have been placed before us by the Government. (Cheers.) My right hon. friend the ChanceUor of the Exchequer has said tonight that he wffl not affirm or deny the resolution, but that he thinks it uncaUed for and unnecessary. The word 'deficiency" has a disagreeable sound. It awakens many singuUr recoUections. We have been accustomed for » number of years to hear, not of deficiency, but of surplus. We had begun to hope that we had almost banished the term "deficiency" from our vocabulary as weU as from our recoUection. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer therefore deprecates the obtrusion upon the notico of the Houso of this invidious and offensive phrase. (A laugh.) He wffl not affirm or deny the resolution, but he thinks it unnecessary and uncalled for. ("Hear," and a Uugh.) He cannot understand the meaning of »djusling income and expenditure. He says there is no adjustment in a Committee of Ways and Means, or in a Committee of Supply, or in a belect Committee, untu the end of the session, when it is perfectly useless. That is the view taken by my right hon. fnend of the duty of the House of Commons with regard to the adjustment of income and expenditure: but it does not »free with my experience. I remember periods-for instance 1842-when this House did feel very severely its duty with regard to the adjustment of income and expenditure. These words which seem to the ChanceUor of the Exchequer ?? if wntten in a foreign language-and indeed I believe if they were wntten in »foreign Unguage he would understand them a great deal better (laughter)-bear a homely English signification, and the task incumbent upon the representatives of the people at this moment is, in my judgment, to see if we can restore to them something of that proper force and significancy which they bear in our own mother tongue. By adjustment of income and expenditure we mean thisthat when you have estimated the fair demands of the public service you shaU take care, so far as Government can, to provide an income which wffl actuaUy cover the whole of it. (Hear.) That is what we meas by the adjustment of income and expenditure. I hope the House wül enlarge the views of my right hon. friend on this point, and certainly by affirming this resolution wo shaU take one great step towards enlarging those views. ("Hear" and a Uugh.) The right hon. gentleman opposite invites us to say-" Do what you will, we wffl have no deficiency. Antecedent to »ny question »bout this or 'hat tax, »bout this or that expenditure, the first duty of the House of Commons is to determine that it wffl have no deficiency. As every honest man determines that he wffl pay his way, that he wffl cut his cloth to his measure, that if he cannot spend aU that he would he wffl spend what he can ; so let your determination be." But, after aU, we are in no such condition. We have to draw upon a treasury which is ample for every purpose. The plea of necessity ought never to be urged in this House as a reason for stinting the pubUc service in its reasonable demands. We are under no such difficulties as press upon an individual, but we are bound to make adequate provision for those services to which we give our sanotion, and not to have recourse to schemes which I do not hesitate to say an honest debtor seeking to compound with his creditors would never venture to advance. (Cheers.) The whole of this matter really depends upon one point. Does my right hon. friend threaten us with a deficiency, or does he not 1 Ho himself has given us his answer upon this subject, and what an answer it is ! On Friday night it escaped him in the course of his speeoh on tho budget to say anything about the balance of a future year. No doubt, it was quite open to my right hon. friend to avoid saying anything »bout the balance of future ????? f only he could let future years alone, or have given future years the same chance which he has given to this year. Bnt I have shown-and I chaUenge contradiction from my right hon. friend-that he is not repealing taxes in this year. He is repealing them to an extent, in comparison, extremely limited. The grand remission which he asks you to make is a remission for the year 1858-9. Now, I ask my right hon. friend and tho Government, "If you are going to retain 4,500,0002. of income-tax for 1857-8, which you are going to vote »way for 1858-9, is it not your duty to show us that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer next year wffl be ab'e to pay his way?" (Cheers.) Is it to be supposed for a moment that we are this year to curry favour with the country by voting away the money pf 18?8-9 in ordor that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer in 1858-9 may be obUged to come down to tho ????? n time of peace and reimpose the income-tax ? (Cheers.) I will not now enter into the question as to the repeal of that tax, but I say that my right hon. friend, who is voting away the money of 1858-9, is under an obligation to show us that he has a reasonable prospect of establishing in that year a baUnce between income and expenditure. (Cheers.) Here I must refer again to those proceedings which, although originaUy my own, yet, having received the sanction of the Government and of ParUament, have now become matter of pubUc record. When, in 1853, we entered into the subject of prospective finance, when we then endeavoured to sketch out what would be the course of expenditure and revenue untU 1860, we should not have been permitted to shelter ourselves, and we did not seek to shelter ourselves, under such doctrines as those set up by my right hon. friend to-night. What does he say ? He says you can estimate the revenue of a future year, but not the expenditure. Why, Sir, does my right hon. friend think, now, that his reputation as » finance Minister wffl be advanced by the adoption of that distinction ? (A laugh.) He can estimate the revenue of a future year ; he can tell us what wffl be the state of trade, what wffl be the state of the consuming population, how much malt, how much tea, how much sugar they wffl be able to consume iu a future year ! Now, I rather think there »re gentlemen in this House who h»ve been ChanceUors of the Exchequer, and who have h»d very meUncholy experience that it is not possible to estimate in » future year wh»t wffl be the consumption of these commodities. (Hear, hear.) On this point I «ay he cannot estimate the revenue of » future year -that i« to say, be can only «Hmate it subject to the ordinary contingencies which mark the course of future affairs.
(Ministerial cheers.) 1? that «ens« he can ; in sny other fense he cannot estimate the revenue of» future year. ("Hear, hear," from the Ministerial benches.) WeU, but that sense in which he can estimate the revenue of futura years is exactly the sense in which he can estimate the expenditure. (Opposition cheers.) I must confess, Sir-it is better, that X should at once ????? out frankly on .this subject-it appears to me that when my right hon. friend stood up in his place and said he could not estimate the expenditure, but could estimate the revenue, he was trifling with the House, and was using us luce children. ("Oh, oh.1" and cheers.) That I frankly own is my opinion. Wh»t, Sir 1 He cannot estimate the expenditure ! He cannot calculate it within any limits ! He cannot teU whether it wffl be 50.000,0002. or 5,000,0002. ! (" Oh, oh !") Be patient, I beseech you, with your exclamations. (A Uugh.) You wffl soon find that I »m speaking reasonably. \j. Syv ^oT k * Permanent course observable »nd established by experience just as muoh in regard to the expenditure as in regard to the revenue of this country; »ndthe national expenditure, apart from the contingencies of war, does not fluctuate more than-nay, not so much »s -the revenue. (Hear, hear.) Now, what has my right hon. fnend done ?-and I should Uke to see and to hear hU defenders. (A laugh.) He has presented to us an expenditure for the year 1857-8, which amounts to 63,250,0002. He î o=o í "? at be wül have a deficiency of 5,000,0002. in 1858-9. His »nswer U that he takes the revenue of 1857-8 "VP?8 lt.,,on to 1858-9, and aUows for the changes which wffl take place in the revenue. He then compares that revenue, not with the expenditure of 1857-8 carried on in Uke manner to 1858-9, with fair aUowanoe for circumstances likely to occur, but he goes back to 1853 with »n expenditure 6,000,0002. less, »nd he oompares the revenue of 1858-9 with the expenditure of 1853. (Cheers ) Where is the gentleman in this House who wiU get up »ud justify such a calouUtion ? Sometimes my right hon, trieod compares, »nd sometimes he says he cannot compare. He says, "I give no opinion: take it for what it is worth: it is something or nothing.* Now, I say we have a right to know the value he attaches to those figures which he himself has quoted. (Hear, hear.) In my opinion they are » pure »nd perfect delusion. Let me »sk him this question. He has compared the revenue for 1853-9 with the expenditure of 1853. Does he in his conscience beUeve that the expenditure ot 1858-9 wffl bo tte expenditure of 1853! (Hear, hear.) Does he beUevo that? No, Sir. You m»y wait long enough for an answer to that question. He does not beUeve it. There is no man hero that believes it ; »nd if we »Uow a statement Uke that of my right hon. friend to go forth with our sanction we are palming off a delusion upon the country. (Hear, hear.) I wffl presently examine the case more particularly, but here is a sum of 1,760,0002. added to the misceUaneous estimates and services of the country since 1853. My right hon. friend knows that the great buik of that is in the shape of permanent charge, and, as to the portion of it whicli stands as temporary charge, although some of this may disappear, it is likely to be succeeded by other and probably more expensive items of the same kind. (Hear, hear.) Every year,for a considerable time past the misceUaneous expenditure of the country has been rapidly increasing. (Hear, hear.) Does my right hon. friend, then, reaUy think this expenditure will be reduced by 1,760,0002. n 1858-9 ? H he sees his way to that, then he is not trifling with us ; but if he does not, if ho knows, as I know, that there has been « progressive increase of charge under this head-that the wants of the country are multiplying-that the disposition of the House of Commons to yield in these matters is greater than it used to be, then I say that my right hon. friend is trifling with us and with the country. Cheers.) Ag»in, Sir, if my right hon. friend thinks that this 1,760,0002. can be disposed of in 1858-9,1 want to knowwhy we are to pay it for 1857-8? (Cheers.) When, I come to ask the House-not to refer tho estimates to, a select committee ; I know perfectly weU how that might defeat the purposes of those who are in earnest by inducing this House to undertake the duty ofthe departments of the Government, which they aro necessarily unable to perform-but when I ask the House to sond the estimates back to the Government in order that they may reconsider them-(and having once practised upon them with iuccess they may again try their hands-when I submit, as I shall, such a. proposition to the House, I shaU certainly ask my right hon. friend why, if we are to pay 1,760,000 less in 1858-9, we are to pay 1,760,000 more in 1857-8? (Cheers.) The truth is, and I beUeve there are not two opinions about it on either side of the House, the reference to the expenditure of 1853 is purely fflusory. We have nothing to do with the expenditure of 1853. I wish wo had. I beUeve that by vigUance and by firmness the House of Commons may produce an impression upon the expenditure. (Hear, hear.) But I am not so sanguine as to beUeve that they can next year go back to the expenditure of 1853. I advance with considerable confidence tte opinion that the real wants of the pubUo service are much more Ukely to increase than they are to diminish in the yesr 1858, as compared with the year 1857. And now, Sir, I wffl give the House some reasons for that opinion. In the present year the charge for the nfflitia stands at 400,000í. That is much below the average charge. I beUeve it is considerably below the probable charge in future years. I find'nofault with the Government for the lowness of that charge. As the mUitia was embodied during the period of the war, I think it perfectly rational that the charge for it in the year succeeding a peace should be Ught ; but I wish to point out to the House the probabfflty that that charge may require to bo increased in future ?????. My right hon. friend has taken the charge for the Persian war at 265,000i. or 270,0002. We know pretty weU of what value thoso figures are Ukely to bo. You have an expedition of considerable magnitude already gone to the Persian Gulf ; you have a further expedition preparing to start from India j if I m right, you are already engaged in sending expensive stores from this country ; and you have Ukewise » separate and distinct expedition from India into Affghanistan. I remember very weU the first estimate for the Chinese war. It was about 160 0002. The cost of that war-I know it was recovered from the Chinese,but I do not apprehend that this is to be recovered from the Persians-the cost of that war, which was of an infinitely less serious charaoter than that in which we are now engaged, was several millions. Then there is the Chinese war, of which up to the present moment we have heard nothing. We hear of troops going from India to China; wo know that destructive service is foing on ; but not one farthing of provision have we made. ly right horn friend told us that he was in the mUitary departments pressed with war contracts ; that there were certain war contracts which had no t yet expired. On the other hand, let me ask how stand his stores of materials? (Hear, hear.) He knows very weU that every depository is bursting-that you have an immensity of stores standing over from the war; but of course as these stores deteriorate by time, as we get more remote from war, your expenditure upon stores and materials must necessarily be expeoted to increase. There is abo the item for the Coastguard. The figures are not very clear, but, so far as I »m, able to understand them, there is a small increase of something Uke 60,0002. or 80,0002. in the probable expense of the Coastguard for the present year. But when the Coastguard BiU was before the House of Commons my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty (Sir ? Wood) stated that it would come only very graduaUy into operation ; that the cost would in the first instance be very Ught, but that at ast a very considerable increase of expenditure would ba incurred. There is another source of increase in our expenditure. My right hon. friend (the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) again in this estimate of income for future years, which he can form, although he can form none of expenditure, has taken the misceUaneous receipts at an amount extraordinarily high. The average of those receipts for tte five years ending with 1854 was 796,0002. My right hon. friend takes them at nearly 1,200,0002. for the present year, »nd at 1,400,0002. for the year foUowing. How that is to happen I know not. I rather fear that we must expect a decline of tho misceUaneous receipts as estimated for this year. Then, Sir, you have to keep in view this fact, that your misceUaneous estimates are in constant and rapid progress ; that, aUowing for aU that you have transferred from the ConsoUdated Fund to the votes of the Honse, the misceUaneous estimates have, within the memory of many who sit here, increased from 2,000,0002. to 6,000,0002.; that they have, at any rate, since 1853, independently of revenue arrangements, increased by 1,750,0002. What probabfflty does that raise for future years? (Hear, hear.) This increase is not owing to casual circumstances; it is necessary. It is partly due, I am afraid, to our carelessness and extravagance: but stffl in a very considerable degree it is the answer of the Government to the increasing and expanding wants of society, and you must in the main, I am assured, look for a growing and teady augmentation in these demands. Therefore, I say, that if we are to deal seriously, I wffl add honestly, with this matter, if we are, as prudent men, and even as honest men, to consider ourselves bound to bring our receipts and expenditure into due reUtion with each other, we musi reckon that our charges-thatis, the real wants of the public service, as distinguished from those unnecessary expenses resulting from wastefulness and extravagance, of which I hope we shall get rid-are in future years much more likely o increase than to diminish in amount. I grant, upon the othor hand, that there are smaU items upon which you will gain. I dare say that the cost of the non-effective departments of the miUtary service wffl by Upse of tíme undergo ome diminution, quite irrespective of any vigorous attempts at retrenchment, I do not at aU dispute that we may upon the whole hope to see a disposition towards an increase of he revenue ; but at the same time I must observe that, though our revenue has heretofore inoreased Urgely, it has ncreased under the influence of that kind of legisUtion upon which my right hon. friend (the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) throws-what shaU I say?-I wffl not say throws contempt, but of which he has certainly spoken in a manner »s far as possible from flattering. Apart from wiso legisation, wo havo no right to anticipate great or rapid growth of the revenuo of this country. WeU, Sir, what I now come to is this. You are going to vote away four mfflions and » half of money from the serviço of the year 1859, which you are going to retain for the service of the years 1857-58. Is tbat » legitimate proceeding ? Aro you authorized to take that step upon the simple plea that you have othing to do with future years? If you vote that sum way from 1859, why do younot vote it away from 1S57-58 ? You keep it for ?7-58 because you want it. You are going o take it away from 1S59. If you take itaway from that year without satisfying yourselves that there wffl then be a just alance between revenue and charges, you are creating a deciency f or that year. (Hear, hear.) For one, I wffl not be responsible for creating that deficiency. It fills me with stonishment that Her Majesty's Ministers, who have in ormer years been assooUted with many beneficial measures with respect to our finances, now show so muoh mdifference o what I for one must venture to caU the very first priniples of duty in regard to the finances of the country. hope the House wül not think I am taking an undue iberty with them (cheers), but, as my right hon. friend has t ono timeseemed to make a comparison for future years, »nd tten,whenpressedwithifaconsequences,has shrunk fromabidng by it, lmust shortly lay before the House the prospects which »re before ??. I take as my standard the income and expenditure of the present year. That is the fair principle. That is the rule by which I had to abide in 1853. I was not aUowed to make arbitrary assumptions, going back to «ome forgotton period, which was merely a means of deluding the people. I tekethe income «nd expenditure of the present year, «nd I «ay th&t tbe T»tion»l course for the House to pursue is to consider what are our prospects^
«s they «re founded upon that basis. Now, Sir, in 1858-9. if you start with an expenditure of 63,250,0002. «nd » ïovonue «? now of 66,365,0002., you have in the first ???? to provide for the pajing off of 3,500,0002. of debt. 1 must say that I listened with astonishment to the speech of my nght hon. friend on that eubject. (Hear, hear.i Two years ago my nght hon. friend, in rather » solemn way Siw? i?1 tøo.Prf""6 of the war, proposed to ParUament to tT,!' ?^? ftmd· Jbny members of this Housel think the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. DisraeUl .was one, I was one myself, »nd many of those who sit near ???????? ?* 1??????? ??????? »f this House objected to that proposal.

The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEB,.-What I was, if you postpone the commencement of it for three years. (Alaugh.), Mr. GLADSTONE.-I feel anything rather than dissatisfied, so far as my argument is concerned, with the explanation of my right hon. friend. I thought he roaUy did propose to pay something, but now it appears, from what he fays, that he proposes to pay nothing (renewed laughter), jot to leave it to the gentleman who may be ChanceUor of the Exchequer three years hence to come down to this House and make a proposal. I think I know what that ???????! wffl be. Ho -wül naturaUy come down »nd say :-" In 1857 there was a most pataotic and upright Government-the Government which had proposed the sinking fund, but, notwithstanding that, they would not undertake it, but proposed its postponement. Weid not propose it, and never recognized its principle. We propose that it shall be adiourned for another three years." (Continued Uughter.") My right hon. friend's explanation does not affect tho argument. When we postpone our obUgations for three years it is pretty easy to teU what wffl become of them. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend then, according to his own £ia,?,?.*£jheyjitand ?? kw, wffl have to pay in 1858-59 66,724,0002. His revenue is now 66,365,0002. ; but in 185859 he is going to lose 4,600,0002. by income-tax, and a further sum of 700,0002. by a faU in the duties upon tea and sugar ; therefore his loss in 1858-59 wffl be 5,300,0002. TJpon his own figures he wffl have a revenue of 61,065,0002. to meet charges which, according to legal arrangeaents, he has himself stated at 66,724,0002. (Cheers.) It is quite true, Sir, that we may have unexpected ????penty, but we may have unexpected adversity. The results of the Persian and Chinese wars may be favourable, but they may be, in a financial view, unfavourable ; and we haro no right to expect that any change so serious wffl take plaoe as to favourably affect the deficiency which must result from the scheme contained in the budget of my right hon. friend. I must now, Sir, go into the future, because my nght hon. friend does not abandon the principle of the termination ofthe income-tax in 1860. On the contrary, he claims credit, not only from those who wish to see the end of that tax-and I am not afraid to confess that I most earnestly desire to see it no longer than 1860 a permanent part of our financial system (cheers)-but also from those who, without wishing to commit themselves to such a decUration, nevertheless consider it wise to endeavour to bring about such a system of revenue ard expenditure as to enable the ChanceUor of the Exchequer to dispense with the income-tax as part of our permanent system of finance. My right hon. friend says that it is a mistake to suppose that his proposal wffl render the cessation of the income-tax less certain than it would be under the arrangement of 1853. He has, it is true, added to the tax, but, by some extraordinary effort of his own mind (a Uugh) he has come to the conclusion, and wishes the House to come to the same conclusion, that that increase adds to the probabfflty of its termination. (A laugh.) ?????? ? ?? the faots M "Ç31*1 this t«? From 1842 to 1843 the income-tax was retained at a uniform rate of 7d. in the pound, and the country at Ust became convinced that the scale of 7d. was a note of perpetuity. (Hear, hear ) My nght hon. friend, now First Lord of the Admiralty, in the year ?8 announced that the sevenpenny scale must be perpetual. (A gesture of dissent from Sir ? Wood.) I beg pardon. My right hon. friend gave utterance to that obse> ?ration, not, I admit, as a matter of prophesy, but as a matter of opinion (hear, hear), and my right hon. fnend always expresses himself so clearly that I could hardly have mistaken his meaning. Well, Sir in the year 1853 what did the Government of which I had the honour of being a member do? We wanted to give the country an assurance that the income-tax should terminate and in order to give the best encouragement for that belief wbch we could give how did we act ? Why, Sir, we proceeded upon the principle that whUe the tax was levied at a uniform rate it could not be regarded other than as a part of our permanent system of finance. (Hear, hear.) We did not alter the mode of levying the tax, but we asked ParUament to make the tax a temporary tax, and to fix its termination (hear, hear), and in order to give an assurance to the country tnat it should only be a temporary tax, we proposed that the rate of it should faU from 7d. to 6d., and then from 6d. to 5d., and that it should altogether cease in the year 1860. (Cheers.) It was not our intention to fetter the judgment of ParUament ; but what we had in view and what we hoped to accompUsh was to bring about such a relation between income and expendituro as to enable the Government at the period which we named to put an end to the income-tax. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, my right hon. fnend has abolished the scheme which he proposed in 1853, and which was accepted by this House and by the country (hear, hear), and by making the rate uniform has done aU he can to mark this tax as a permanent impost. (Loud cheers.) And whUe my nght hon. friend does so he makes no proposal for the reconstruction of the mode of levying this tax so as to put it in a form more acceptable to the country. It is true that in 1853 we did not attempt to reconstruct the mode of levying it, but then we did aU we could to mark it as a temporary tax, whüe my right hon. friend has done aU he can to mark it as a permanent one. (Loud cheers. ) WeU, Sir, my right hon. friend has shown us what he thinks wffl be the state of things when the income-tax expires, as by the Actof 1853 it ought to expire, in 1861. In. the year 1853 the Government of that day laid before Parliament conclusions, based not upon vague and arbitrary assumptions of probable income and expenditure, but proceeding from the actual income and expenditure of the country. They calculated what the charges proposed would produce, both of profit and loss, and Uid bef ore ParUament the state of things which, as far as could be calculated, would exist in 1861, when the income-tax was to cease. What is the case now, and what are the calcuUtions of my nght hon. friend? It appears that in 1857-58 the loss to the revenue from diminished income-tax and from the tea and sugar dutits, subject, perhaps, to a sUght diminution from increased consumption, wffl be 5,300,0002. In 1858-59 the loss upon tea and sugar wffl be 600,0002. In 1859-60 the loss on the income-tax wffl be 3,500,0002., and on tea and sugar 500,0002. ; altogether 4,000,0002. So that in the three years the tot«! loss wffl be 9,900,0002. Now, what have we on the other side of the account to set against this ? In the first place there wffl be 1,000,0002. less Exchequer-bonds to pay^iVviüen the urease from succession duties I estimate a» 400,0002., and thirdly, the annuities to faU in wffl amount to 2,116,0002., making altogether 3,546,0002. ; so that on the ?,0,« this calculation there appears a deficiency for the year 1860-61 of 6,454,0002. This is a matter weU worthy the consideration of this House (hear), but I do not end here. I have already shown the House that at the commencement of the year 1860-61 there wffl be a deficiency of 6,454,0002. Now let us see whether that deficiency wffl be increased or dimiiibhed in the year 1861-62. In the year 1861 there wffl be a gain upon Exchequer-bonds of l,000,00u2., but there wül ce a loss of 3,500,0002. upon the income-ta-c, so that the total deficiency in 1S61-62 wffl amount to 8,654,0002., or yery nearly what isnow caUed the "war ninepence." (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, it appears to me that the real questions for the House to consider are-whether, in the first place, aU the pledges which were given in 1853 and aU the expectations which were then held out are now to be cast to the winds (hear, hear) by the same persons who gave those pledges and who raised those expectations (hear, hear) ; and, in the second place, whether by an improvident expenditure and a reckless system of finance we are to charge the country with a. great and growing deficiency. It appears to me, Sir, that the present state of things imperatively calls upon us to make such arrangements in our system of finance as wül be absolutely necessary if we really mean to pay the public creditors. (Loud cheers.) I much fear that I have trespassed too long upon the indulgence of the House (loud cheers), but there is one other poin tof great importance about which I should wish to offer a few observations, and it is to me a very painful subject. (Derisive cries of "Hear, hear," from behind the Ministerial bench.) Some gentleman behind the Treasury bench appear to ridicule that statement. I at no time (although I may give a strong expression to my opinion) wish to offend or annoy any one ; but I think that those gentlemen wül presently agree with me that the subject deserves sympathy rather than ridicule. (Hear, hear.) 1 refer to the subjeot of indirect taxation. (Hear, hear.) I have endeavoured to show that the statement of my right hon. friend would convey to the country an untrue impression with regard to the taxes which are to be paid, that it would convey an untrue impression with regard to the deficiency, and now, 1 am sorry to be obliged to say, that I -think it would produce an untrue impression with regard to the important subject of indirect taxation. (Hear, hear.) J.t is ihe first time within my recoUection that I have heard from the Treasury bench proposals of the nature, spirit, and tendency of those advanced by my right hon. friend on the subject of indirect taxation. We have seen and heard many ChanceUors of tho Exchequer. We recollect the time of the Ute Sir Robert Peel. I T·;£ tñíUr*e£1b?!ik' »"bonghi might easUydo so. I mm«, ^ir .RI1Ìht-hon· gentleman the membeí for Portsmouth (Sir F. Banng) We remember him, and we remember Sir Robert Peel. We remember the right hon. gentleman the Fust Lord of the Admiralty. We remember too, the right hon. gentleman opposite, the member for Buckinghamshire. Every one of those gentlemen, represent mg.different pwties in the State, and in different political poutions gave from that box one and the same acZnt of the effect produced by the remissions of indirect taxation. Sir this question is not a party one. It was the misfortune of the right hon. baronet the member for Portsmouth that he found himself ma position whioh led him to add to ocr indirect taxation. I have no doubt that he has bng ago repented of that measure. ("Hear" and a slight Uugh ) I have no doubt that, though it was an error of judgment on his patt, it was stiU an error to be attributed to necessity, and did not represent the spontaneous action of his deliberate wül. Sir Robert Peel came into power supported by an overwhelming majo rity, and then in the f uU possession of its confidence. WhUe
in the full possession of its confidence and with its cheerful Ä h«.»JPPlied to the tariff of this "ukT thosSS: ??^?1^6 succeeding Ministers h»ve onlyiÄ Stand í*. «?-????T v al'^ reduced duties; not beingiistrueted inttepnuoaopny of Arthur Young, he set mdustryfrefcMy far « T ^Jîî*1?^^1 oensamption. ? no instance, as í!Li recoUect, did he increase them. The right ¿on. fSftSIL*^ mimber 'or Buckinghamsbire, «& came U°ffice T »be year 1852, and led the House of commons asthe representative of Lord Derby's Government, 5,,*,Ä? whe,n.th»t Government, without doubt, possessed during tne whole of its career the full confidence, at «ny rate, of those who sat behind them-that right hon. gentleman himself bore the Urgest testimony to the immense »dvantage which had attended the remission of indirect taxation. I need not go further down in the list, at least I ghaU pass over the next link in the chain, but I come to the right hon. gentleman the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. From him, for the first time in 15 years, I hear a dînèrent strain. Tho idea of the remission of indirect taxation, of the simpUfication of our commercial laws, of giving to trade aU the freedom compatible with the effective maintenance of revenue, has no place in his mind. In his mind there is only room for disparaging estimates of what yet remains to be accompUshed in order to perfect the work which I venture to say is destined to fill a bright page in the history that shaU record the doings of our times. What has already been the effect produced by your operation? I wiU not anticipate the motion that I intend to make on this subject by now going into detaUs; but within the compass of not mote than three or four lines is it possible to submit to the House a statement so remarkable that I am convinced every man who loves truth, or who loves humanity-every man who desires to see his feUow-creatures In possession of such a supoly of the bounties of Providence as wise and just legislation can secure, whatever may have been his previous dispositionwill not hesitate to yield his judgment and his heart to refute so extraordinary. Sir. here »ro tho operations of the ??"??? ??7??????' between the years 1842 »nd 1853 :-From 1842 to 1846, when a Conservative Government was in office, and quite apart from that crisis with respect to a contested question which putan end to &? career of that Government -the remissions of indirect taxes were 8,050,0002. (Hear, hear.) For the five years extending from 1847 to 1851 while my noble friend the member for London was at the 5?·?? °Líhe ^0T?rnment· the remissions of taxes were 5, ¿10,0002. In the three years from 1852 to 1854 the remissions were 4,625,0002. The total amount of your remissions, in short, is 21,985,0002. (Cheers.) But, you wffl say, concurrently with these measures of reUef there were other taxes imposed. WeU, no doubt there were the income-· tax and some other imposte ; but then, whUe the »mount of the taxes remitted was 21,985,0002., the »mount of those P"toiiand brought into effect within the same period was 7,500,0002. ; so that the operation, taken thus far, represents a sam-of 14,4S5,0002. And of what did the great' bubs of that gam consist? It was so much addition to the comforts and the resources, so much deduction from the privations and the difficulties, of the %?? eat mass of the people. (Cheers. ) But, Sir, even that statement does not express the whole result of your poUcy, because, while the revenue in the first of those years-1842-was 46,965,0002., in, the last year-namely, 1853-1 can't take 1854, ÜÜ?I«& Ä ? w?r taxes wete then imposed-in 1853 it 54,430,0002. So that your revenue during the same period, m which yon remitted 22,000,0002., increased by 7,500,0002. being the exaot amount of the taxes you simultaneously imposed. In faot, it is no exaggeration to state that your remission of 22,000,0002. of taxes did not cost you one farthing. (Cheers.) I say that » man may be glad and thaokful to be an Englishman, and to have been a member of the Bntish House of Commons during those years, bearing his part in so blessed a work. (Hear, hear.) But, if it be a blessed work, what are we to say of him who begins the undoing of it ? What is my right hon. friend about to do í As far as his statement of Fnday night is concerned, you would have imagined that this innocent and harmless budget of his was going to remit, not to impose, taxes on tea and sugar ; because there was » figure that crept out which spoke of 700,0002. as the loss he would sustain. I ventured, when he had sat down, »fter estimating this loss," to rise and ask at what amount he estimated his gain. ("Hear, hear," and a Uugh.) That question, Sir, has not yet been answered. But the case stands thus:Jhe war tax on tea wffl faU on the 5th of April next from Is. 9d. to Is. 3d. per lb. My rteht hon. friend proposes to raise it again to Is. 7d. : and thin he taxes credit for 2d. of remission. (Laughter.) Thfa is his process. He says he remits 2d.; I say he imposes 4d. The difference between us is considerable ; and the House, I think, wffl readüy fora its judgment as to which of us is right. He intends to introduce resolutions enabUng him to levy on the 6th of April a duty which by Uw would notbe leviable. That I caU an increase of taxation. (Hear.) He calls it a reduction. The difference between us is broad-it is one of principle, and radical. The effect of his proposal wül be to add during the yesr 1857-8 l,0o4,0002. to the tax on tea. Then comes the case of sugar These cases I wish to discuss more at length on a future occasion. I therefore now state only the amounts. To the duty on sugar he proposes to add Is. per cwt. I take brown Muscovado as best exemplifying the effect of his P¿?í: . consnmPtion in 1856 was 7,250,000 cwt. One shffling nicrease upon thfa will give him 362,0002., which, coupled with the 1,054,0002. to ?? put upon tea, makes a total of 1,416,0002.-the amount which he seeks to add to the indirect taxation of the country such as it wffl ?&:<?? "î levUble after the 5th of April next. In 185S-9 he further aggravates the case, because the additional duty he then lays, if I recoUect rightly, is 5d. instead of 4d. on tea, -æd b. lOd. instead of Is. on sugar; and in the year 1858-9, therefore, with his deficiency, he wffl have the Pleasure of extracting from the purchasers of tea and «near throughout the country nearly 2,000,0002. over and above what under the present Uw they would be Uable to pay. inat is the operation of my right hon. friend. I reaUy cannot help representing to the House the position ? which it is supposed to stand. I beUeve it has been the boast of the Liberal party in this country to associate itself especiaUy with the remission of indirect taxation. (Cheers.) As I said before, it has been a work in which Conservative vrovemmentshave largely shared : but the Liberal party appear to me always to have had a peculiar pnde in their close identification with it. Sir, if they feel that sentiment of pride I trust they wffl have an equal regard for consistency and honour in adhering stedfastiy to that work ; that they wffl not aUowit to be pulled to pieces. With respect, however, to this House at large, 1 beg you to observe the position in which the Government now invite you to place yourselves, and to comparo it with the position you occupied in 1842. In that year jou had a Ministry of the Conservative party with a triumphant majority at its back. And weU do I recoUect the day when Sir Eobert Peel turned round to hia supporters, and, having shown the deficiency in the revenue, and stated his intention to propose the remission of 1,400,0002. of indirect taxes, then said-" I make an appeal to the possessors of property-I caU on them to come forward and saddle themselves with the burden of an income-tax m order to enable them to dispense great and precious boons to themass of their f eUow countrymen." (Cheers ) That appeal was cheerfully and honourably answered. There were pohtical objections raised to the income-tax on other grounds, but that great majority in the ParUament of 1841 to a man stood firm, to a man answered the cadi, and took upon themselves, the wealthy classes of the country, the burden of the income-tax, in order to supply the deficiency, and to repeal 1,400,0002. of indirect taxes. (Hear, hear. Can any man fail to be struck with the precise correspondence in particulars, with the complete inversion in spirit and principle, of that arrangement and of thu» (Cheers.) Then you were caUedupon to remit 1,400,0002. of indirect taxes, now you are caUed on to impose indirect taxes to ttat amount ; then you were caUed on to fill up a deficiency at your own cost, now you are caUed on to create a deficiency at the cost of others ; you were then caUed' upon to take a burden on yourselves to relieve the great mass of your feUow-countrymen, now you are caUed upon to take a burden off the shoulders of the wealthier classes in order that you may impose indirect taxes upon the tea and sugar which are conäumedby every Ubouring family in the country. (Cheers.) I can only say that, for my own part. 1 entertam on this subject a most decided opmion, and nothing shaU induce me to refrain from riving every constitutional opposition in my power to such a proposition. Before the Speaker leaves the chair, if health and strength be spared me, I sh&U invite the House to decUre that, whatever taxes we remove, we wül not impose more duties upon the tea and sugar of the working man. When we are in committee there wffl be other opportunities of renewing this protest. These things, if they are to be done, shaU, at least, not be done in a comer. The Ught of day shaU be let in upon them, and their meaning and consequences shaU be weU understood. I come now, and it is the last point upon which I shaU touch, for I feel that I have trespassed too long upon the House, and cannot bo too thankful for its indulgence (hear, hear), to the bearing of these opinions upon the motion now before the House, and to say that we wffl have no additional taxes upon tea and sugar, to increase vhe deficiency. There is an enormous deficiency created by the proposal of the Government, and «ut we are asked to supply by a most objectionable mode of raising money, and to which I hope nothing wffl induce this House deUberately to resort. That increases my obligation to vote for the motion. I frankly own that motion appears to me in complete conformity with the declaration which I, in common with the rest of the House heard from the lips of the right hon. gentleman on the firat mgbt of the session (hear, hear), and it offers, I think, the most practical mode of doing good to the pubUo. The right hon. gentleman invites us to affirm that we wffl have no deficiency. . Tho proposal ?? the Government shows a gUrjng, gross, and increasing deficiency,-a deficiency unparalleled by anything that I can recoUect during an experience of some 25 years. The first duty of the House of Commons is to say that it wffl leave no deficiency, »nd when we have once said that onr course wül be clear, because if we are to haveno deficiency we must square our accounts, either by keeping on existing taxes, by laying on new taxée, or by reducing expenditure. (Hear, hear.) On a f ormer evening I ventured to comment on the extraordinary indifference of the public mind on the subject of expenditure, and I expressed my opinion of the dangerous enlargement which our expenditure was assuming. Already, Sir, I see , very plainly, that if I allow the motion of the right hon. gentleman to be lost I shaU be driven to mako a motion on the subjeot of expenditure which I am quite convinced, if it stands alone, I shall not carry. I am afraid, if it comes to a question of expenditure, however rash it may be, and deficiency, the deficiency will be preferred, because the deficiency is prospective, it is stffl » little distant, it is,not immediate, and something or other may happen in tho interval to avert it. I despair of inducing the House to grapple with this question, unless it is under cover of the principle of the right hon. gentleman's motion, and if that principle is once established the House will have no choice but to set honestly about its duty, to consider what taxes shall be kept, what proposed, and what abandoned, and what shall be our expenditure. That is one great motivo whioh I have for giving my support to the motion of the right hon. gentleman. -But I have other motives on which I regard this »???! wk ""S"1* 'm confOTity with the pledges to í,"Jr,f45old,"?solíbouo<1. andto which I thought that wf-nri¿,, wh0 Slt. "J1 the Treasury bench were likewise AÏÏffiïï-*î-h me.Thej, however, are the best judges of their obligations. I feel myself bound, and I shall
do «? in my power to redeem those pledges.. Let it not be said that this is an impracticable ?????????. I believe that it u perfectly practicable by » -wise economy, by »fair appeal to the good «ense ©f the Commona of England, both to grant relief from taxation «ndto make a reduotion in the expenditure which wffl enable you to maintain a surplus income, »nd thus to look . ?£? witb; confidence to that Urge and satisfactory relief JV.i60,whlcF» so fa,r as was in our power, we promised in 1853. I feel strongly upon thissubject, and I dare say I have expressed myself in strong language. I hope it has not been stronger than the occasion demands. I confess I do feel strongly the nature of these propositions. I wffl conceal nothing. I may be wrong »nd my judgment m»y err like that of other men, but this is the first time-I will not say that I have heard a deficiency recommended and sanctioned by the Government, for, unfortunately, I have heard that, and in principle it was quite ?? bad as this proposition, though in degree it was entirely differentS?1» certainly, that I have heard propounded from the Treasury bench, by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer, a plan which seems to threaten to throw the land into financUl confusion. (Cheers.) I felt that it was our duty to strip the veil from a statement which was certainly calculated to convey false impressions to the country, »nd from tte discharge of that duty I could not shrink. Every year that a man Uves he learns to estímate more humbly his own powers ; he must be content to see remain unaccompüshed much that he may earnestly desire ; but in this free, happy country there is one pnvüege, and one corresponding duty, which remains to man-it is to bear his testimony in open day to the duty and the necessity of maintaining pubUo obUgations, »nd to strip »way every veü from every scheme which tends to undermine this principle. That duty, with the indulgence of the House, I have endeavoured to discharge. No consideration upon earth would induce me by voice or by vote to be a party to a financial plan with regard to which I feel that it undermines the poUcy which has guided the course of every great and patriotic Minister in this country, and which is intimately associated not only with the credit »nd the honour, but even withthe safety, of this country. (Loud Mr. WILSON was sure that he should not appeal to the House in vain for its indulgence whüe he attempted, not to f oUow his right hon. friend who had just sat down through «11 the «rguments on whioh he had touched, but to pUce before the House, in as clear and succinct a manner as he could, what he thonght to be the errors into which his right hpn. friend had faUen. After the relations which had previously existed between his right hon. friend and himself nothing was more painful to him than to find himself in antagonism to his right hon. friend either upon that or any other occasion ; and the statements whioh he was about to make in refutation of some of his arguments, and the attempt which he should make to rectify some of his misconceptions, should be made with the solo desire of eUciting truth »nd of placing the subject fairly before the House. (Haar, hear.) There were at least some topics on which his right hon. friend and the members of the Government were agreed. HI3 right hon. friend told them that they should endeavour, at aU hazards and by aU means,· to carry out, if posible, the implied contract which had been come to in 1853. In that view he (Mr. Wilson) perfectly concurred, and as to the means of doing it he should offer some observations hereafter. His right hon. friend also urged them not willingly to incur « deficiency of income as compared with expenditure, and in that Ukewise he (Mr. Wilson) concurred. When his right hon. friend, however, spoke of the advantages of repealing indirect taxation, he might remind him of the condition of the sugar duties when Lord John RusseU came into office, when the lowest duty upon colonial sugar was 14s. a-ewt. »bove the highest duty »tthepresent moment, and when the lowest duty which then existed upon foreign sugar was 23s. 8d. per cwt. He was sure that his righthon. friend did not mean to insinuate that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer wished them to revert either to excessive or to protective duties of import, because his right hon. friend must be aware that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer had quoted from from Arthur Toung merely to justify the proposition which he had made, that the additional taxation necessary for the war was fairly to be levied over aU classes of taxes, whether direct or indirect. (Hear, hear.) W»3thatanew principle ? They were now dealing, though in time of peace, with the obUgations which had been left them in time of war, and how did they meet the expenditure of the war? By the very principle by which the Chancellor of tte Exchequer now proposed to pay the remaining obUgations of the war. In 1854, when his right hon. friend the then ChanceUor of tte Exchequer doubled the income-tax, did he think it necessary to supply aU the means for carryng on the war from direct taxation? On the contrary, did he not find it essential, in justice to aU classes of the community, to impose some indirect as weU as direct taxes 2 Hear, hear.) That was the principle which was initiated by his right hon. friend in the first war budget, for the earUest thing which was done in 1S54, when the first war taxes were Uid on, was to increase the sugar duties and to uspend the faU of tte tea duties. His right hon. friend then said," It was clear to us that it was impossible to ask the committee to make any sacrifice of revenue, under present circumstances, upon the sugar duties; but if we lowered the sugar duties upon a certain class, and that produced » less revenue, it foUowed that we should be driven to raise the duties on other classes of sugar, and, in point of fact, in some form or other, there must be at least a partial increase of the sugar duties. There is another consideration which has induced Her Majesty's Government to make a proposal on the subject of the sugar duties, and it is this. This is »n article on which we can ask you to increase the means of tte Treasury without »dding to the price paid by the consumer-I mean now at present paid by the consumer. I do not mean the price he would have to pay supposing the alterafaons which have been provided for by the present Uw should take effect. It is withholding a boon not yet enjoyed, not withdrawing a boon the actual enjoyment of which he has already attained." That was precisely what the Chancellor of the Exchequer was doing now. In point of fact, he was not now entirely -suspending, but he was practicaUy reducing the duties. (Hear, hear.) In the foUowing November his right hon. friend, knowing that the tea duties would faU to Is. 3d. in the ensuing April, suspended that decline and maintained them at Is. 6d. (Cries of " That was during the war.") True, that was a time of war, but what were they talking about now but war? (Hear, hear.) At the same time his right hon. friend issued 2,000,0002. of bonds avowedly in anticipation of the payment of taxes. In the same year he issued an additional 4,000,0002., and those 6,000,0002. of bonds had now to be provided f or. Therefore, although we were now at peace, we had stffl incumbent upon us the obUgations of war. (Hear, hear.) He would now caU the attention of the House to the real question before them. There had been a paper circulated among members which showed the obligations which had been incurred during the war, »nd which were payable in successive years after peace. That paper showed that there -would have to be repaid next year 3,671,0002., in the foUowing vear 4,824,0002., and in the third year 4,707,0002. Did not that expenditure belon» ?? much to the war as any expenditure which had been defrayed during the war? Had the money which we had now5to repay been expended for war purposes, or had it not l Had those bonds been issued m anticipation of taxes or had thoy not? (Hear, hear.) If they fiad, were not those taxes justly apphcable to the payment of those bonds in the same manner as they were to the payment of the war expenditure? Looking at tha financial position of this present year, there wa» according to law an mcome-taxof 16d. in the pound, which would 4*ZfSl,lded 1$'(??<«??·. »nd they would have lost d,UW,W02, upon tea and sugar at the commencement of the year. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer had justly explained the other night that it never was the intention of the Government to take advantage of the technicality by which they might.have continued the income-tax for another yearbut surely it became the Government to consider in what way the expenditure remaining from the war could be met Suppose that the Government had adhered to their strict'v legal position, they would have had a surplus atisin» from the sixteenpenny income-tax of 5,000,0002., which "would not have been required for the expenditure of the year, but ttat surplus could not have been made avaUable Î°J ;"2 .Piment of tho debts of foUowing years. The deficiency, therefore, must be made up by taxes of some kind or other. The Government did not suspend the Ml of the taxes on tea and sugar, but only mitigated their force for the next two years, and that was the best course to pursue both with regard to tho interests of the consumer and the state of the finances. His right hon. friend said that the Government did not relinquish 9,000,0001 of the income-tax. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer had never said they did. He stated that 9d. of the income-tax wonld be given up from the 1st of April, »nd as tbe current halfyear would be coUected he would only lose half that amount. But his nght hon. fnend said that because the ChanceUor of the Exchequer relinquished the income-tax in the present year he gave up his income-tax for 185S-9 and created a deficiency. But his nght hon. friend was here in error He had stated to the House that the ChanceUor of thè Exchequer had taken the income of the two years 185S-9, and that he had been satisfied to balance that income by takinï the income of 18D3-4. But ho had done nothing o£ thl kind. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer had stated the probab e income of 1858-9 at ?????.???. Thlex£nditure «Ä^Ä the ï°-st of ooHeotion, was only 55,860,0002 ; so that there was left a margin over the exnenditme of 1853-4 of no. less than 7,000.0002. or 8,000,0002. Then his nght hon. fnend asked whother the ChanceUor of the Exchequer meant to teU the House that he intended to bring down the expenditure of 1858-9 to the level of 1853-4, »nd then ho referred to the charges upon the cml semce estimates as being beyond the control of the Government. This was true. The estimated b~^a of 1858-9 was 62,300,0002., and that wa?Tlmuted ?1 moderate estimate, and one which made no allowance for the expansion of trade and the relief to industry given by the reduction of the income-tav. The expenditure of 18o3-4-which the ChanceUor of the Exchequer did not take as the standard of expenditure, but as the last and highest year of peace, and the only ye-r with which the year 18a8-9 could he compawd-was 55,810,0002. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer said he could not hazard an opmion as to the estimated expenditure of next vearand who would pretend to be able to doso ? Could hisn»ht hon. friend have dreamt, when he made his ma-mificentre turnin May, 1853, that the whole fabric that he reared would so soon have come down? (Hear, hear.) He then proposed a reduction of the income tax, within two years, to 6d and within two years more to 5d., but within 12 months his right
ion.-fnend bad to raise it twice in the «ame year (near), »naw»3WmpeUedtojr»ise Urge^^ additional taxesupon tóM ».?????*10^: The «towfeä income of 1859-6(> wag 6235,0002. The expenditure, incindin»· the Increase in the civü «ervice estimates, was 58,276.0002. leaving » margin of nearly 4,000,0002. Bat his rieht ????. inend had insisted, »nd there was the fallacy, on fastening the Chancellor of the Exchequer with the expenditure of'the present year as tte basis ot the exTonditure of »11 the years to come. No one had contended ttat it was in the power of the great departments to reduce their expenditure during the first or second year of peace to the lowest scale at which the establishments could be kept. His nght hon. friend had referred to buüdings and constructions as matters upon whioh no reduetten could bo expected, but those were the very things in which the largest reduction would be made, since when the , buüdings were constructed the expense did not require to be renewed. He must say that his right hon. fnend had not treated theChauceUor of the Exchequer with that f ??????? wbch was characteristic of aU his proceedings (a Uugh), when he insisted upon «ceptin» the present estimate of expenditure as the only estimate which TÏer5,^IMght'!e,ex?e'!ted to see for any time tocóme. líe had listened with the greatest attention and admiration to the speech of his right hon. friend, but to that moment he did not understand what was the real vice w 'ÄtÝ ^ fo?nd with the budset. (Hear, hear.) Was it that he found fault with the repeal of the war income-tax next year? Wasit that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer repealed too many taxes, or too few? Wasit that he was going to leave a financial deficit or to burden the people with taxation? (Hear, hear.) But these questions were on the threshold of the present inquiry. That House was not a debating club, talking theoretically, but was supposed to be practically at work to raise the means and square the income of the country. Hon. members first pressed the ChanceUor of the Exchequer to produce his budget before they had decided upon the expenditure, and then they bUmed him for askinc for more money than was necessary, because they thought the expenditure too large. That was nottreating the ChanceUor of the Exchequer quite fairly. (Hear, bear.) It appeared that his nght hon. friend concurred with the Chancellor of theExchequenn repealing the 9d. war incometax. Every one »greed ttat this ought to be done. What else had he done? He had added 2d. more to the incometax ? foUowing years, and had postponed the drop on the teaduties. Everything the Chancellor of the Exchequer had done was not to.produce a deficit, but to prevent one. YVnat would those hon. members wish the ChanceUor of the Exchequer to do who said ttat ho ought to have provuled f or the possible expenditure two years after the budget ' _w as his nght hon. friend to propose increased taxation now in order to meet an im»ginary deficit three years hence ? He contended that nothing his right hon. friend had done was escalated in the slightest degree to impede the settlement of 1853. That -was done by tte war, which put » stop to every financial scheme on which they had entered since 18o3, and would continue in some degree to do so tffl aU our obUgations incurred during the war were paid off. Therefore it was not fair to say that his right hon. friend (the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) had done anything to make T>???? reTote or less possible the repeal of the income-tax in 1860. His nght hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone) had spoken in language that must have come to the minds of aUofthe effects produced by the repeal of indirect taxation in this country. Nobody could caU in question the good effects that had resulted from that repeal ; but, at the same timo it was impossible to deny that the consequences which flowed from such a policy must depend very much on tte state of the market at the time. Indirect taxes might be repealed at a time when no benefit -would flow to the consumer-at a time when stocks were so low that the reduction of dutywould only go to sweU the profits of the importers. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, however wise and benencent such measures might be generaUy, care should be taken not to let the revenue suffer when it was obvious that no benefit would accrue to the consumer. His right hon fnend (the ChanceUor of the Exchequer) had been well advised on this subject. He had teken pains to ascertain the condition of those markets that would be affected by a change of the duties to which reference had been made, and had found that the effect would not be to injure the consumers, whüe the revenue would be increased. But, whUe his nght hem. friend suspended for a short time the decline of the duties on tea and sugar, he took care to provide for the ultimate and not very remote accomplishment of their reduction to the lowest posable point. (Hear, hear.) Therefore he was not open to the accusation that he was not sufficiently aUve to the great advantage of those principles of which he had been the advocate and supporter for so many years, (Hear.) He \?? Wüson) beUeved the effect of the budget to be that it would provide effectuaUy the income necessarv f or the expenditure of the year; that, while it did so, there" was nothing in it to impair the prospects of future years, but that, on the contrary, it would do a great deal to enable future Chancellors of the Exchequer to meet their obUgations by modifying the difficulties that might be in their way. He contended, then, that the two points laid down in the resolution of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. DisraeU) ought to be negatived by the House. The resolution maintained thatthey should so arrange their expenditure in the present year as to preserve them from a deficit in foUowing years. Was the House prepared to impose taxes in 18?7-58 to meet the services of 185S-59 and 1859-60 ' It was ¡ül very weU to propose pUns for the gradual decline of the income-tax, but after so many disappointments it would be wrong to come to any solemn declaration that the tax would cease in a given year. In 1845 the prospect was held out of its aboUtion in three years ; but there came in the first year the Irish famine, which was in tho next year greatly aggravated, and in that foUowing there was much commercial distrees, so that Instead of aiminishbg, the Government had to ask for an add'Mon to the income-tax. Did that hold out encouragement to tbem to make any solemn declaration on the subject ? (Hear ) His nght hon. friend (Mr. GUdstone) must admit that with ?T to one or two very essertial points of his plan of 1«53 he had been doomed to disappointment. First camo the war, which destroyed aU his calcuUtions; ard next came a deficiency in one of his most carefully elaborated schemes. The right hon. gentleman calculated SntriSS first year of the succession dutywould produce * 'o^'rSSf "íä* dunnS tbe present year it would amount to ¿,000,0002. But the result was that it now produced exactly what it did the first year,-vã. 500,0002. From that source alone there was a deficiercy of 1,500,00- 2, (Hear.) This showed how undesirable it was to found too certain expectations on what would happen in future ????3 with regard to income. (Hear.) AU they could do was to avoid, if possible, every course which, in the meantime, would render necessary increased taxation, or endanger settlements which the House had in its wisdom carefuUy and deUberately resolved upon. (Hear.) Mr. LAING wished in a few words to explain in what manner he thought it possible to obtain the object laid down in the resolution of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Diiraeli.) He proposed to attain the object which was reached in 1848 When the Minister of the day, having brought in a budget containing estimates that were considered to be excessive, had to take that budget back again, subject the estimates to a complete revision, and bring forward new estimates framed with a greater regard to economy, thus saving the pubUc upwards of 3,000,0002. of money. He begged to call the attention of the House to the fact stated bythe ri»ht hon. gentleman (Mr. GUdstone), that from 1842 to 1853 the expenditure of the country rem-ined stationary, whUe from 18o3 to 1857 the ordinary permanent expenditure showedan mcrease of 6,000,0002. It was high time, then, for every one who caUed himself a reformer to insist on a reduction of expenditure. (Hear, hear.) If the fstiraates were necessary estimates, then tho inference was irresistible that next year would find them with a deficiency. It would be found tbat their resources faUed them, and if next year the expenditure was framed on the same scale as ^-?'?, £? effeot wonld te that with an expenditure of SS'íA4'9x2f !*?? ???1? have an income of only bA30i>,0002. That was a result from which they could not escape. Theymighttry, to besure, to diminish the deficiency by postponing the operation of the sinking fund intended to pay off the obligations incurred during the war; but the defacit would be too large to get quit of in that way. (Hear, hear.) But if it was said there was a probable way of escaping the deficiency by reducing the estimates, then he asked why they could not do in 1857 what was done in 1848 ? He had examined the estimates mainly with a view af seeing how far,they would bear out the assertion that the Urge expenditure for which they provided was caused by the war, »nd the more he had examined them the less encouragement could he find for thinking if they were aUowed to pass this year any Urge or material reduction would be made m them next year. The estimates for the naval and miUtary establishments, excluding the coastgurrd and other expenses; which could not fairly enterbte the comparison, exceeded by about three mfflions the estimates of 1853-4. Ihe causes of that excess were partly the amount of the naval and mUitary forces, but principally the 1-rge scale upon which it was proposed to maintain the dockyards, and the expenditure it was proposed to make upon bricksland mortar. (Hear, hear.) Without troubling SLi ? ?f°? ,the Present occasion with any .ffiirflj «"»Ply state in round numbers, the resulte at which he had arnved from » careful analysis of tho estiTate§ »;d a comparison between them and the estimates \ ¿vi ? - ?°? »m<ra»t voted for manufacturing establishments, mcluding steam factories and works for the manufacture of arms, in 1853-4 was 2,700,0002., whUe in ? In/fS6"' S.elr.the same item amounted to no less than ö\8OO,OO02., the increase bemg 1,100,0002. What possible effect could the war have produced upon these establishments? He shonld, have thought that it would have had the effect of diminishing the expenditure upon tbein, and, as they were amply supplied with magazines and stores, that they would only have to spend 10,000,0002 where they had once spent 50,030,0002. They had a most magnificent steam fleet, comprising vesseU of aU kindsfrom the Duke of Wellington to a gunboat-two-thirds of ;" hich might not be used for years, and vet thoy proposed to increase by 1,100,0002. the sum they had devoted to shipbuilding purposes in 1S53-4. (Hear, hear.) Then the »mount proposed to be expended upon new erections, upon pulling to pieces and putting up again, was 1,506,0002., »lso «considerable increase ?? compared with 1S53. These figures filled him with alarm, and they related to matters to which the attention of the committee of 1818 was mainly directed. The result of the inquiry of that committee was that »n economy of 3 000,0002. was effected in the estimates, and the amount voted was expended with greater efficiency. AVas there any reason for this increased expenditure? We were at peace with thegreat nations of Europe ; we now felt no apprehension as to what might be done by a Russian fleet. and we were cordially affied to France. He had made these remarks,because, in his opinion, the question of the estimates was the whole question. (Hear, hear.) It would be impossible either for hon. genteinen opposite, who were opposed to the income-tax, or for hon. gentlemen aroundhim, who wereoppesedtomdirecttaxation, to carry out their views unless the estimates were reduced. TJntü there was a diminution of expenditure not only could there be no remission of the mcome-tax, but they would have to submit to a reimpositionof thoso indirect taxesfrom which the industry of the country had been released by recent legislation. The moment they took that course, the moment they replaced indirect taxation, they would reverse the beneficial process which had taken place upon its remission, they woula find that two and two did not always make four in financial arithmetic, and that they mi2ht double the amount of indirect taxation without doubling the revenue
derived from it. (Hear, hear.) For these reasons, aña êfltertainttg*íb4)»goplMonofthe»bsoluteneceesiF of imposing «omeçheck upon what threatened to be »n extravagant expenditure, he had made up his mind to vote in «udport of therresolntion before the House. He hoped that S tte bndgetwere remitted to tte Ministry tte result would ES^fègniSiï*·** »better budget would theíadjouríei1101 ^ JAHE3 M'Geeook» *be debate was REFORMATORY SCHOOLS BILL. Sir G.

MILNES praised the Government for havine introduced the measure, which, though by no means conclusive, was, as far as it went, very satisfactory. Mr. LIDDELL besought the Government to give ample time for tte ratepayers, who would be assessed by a body in which they were not represented, to express their opinion before the next stage. Sir-J. DUCKWORTH anticipated that, as in the case of thePoliceBUls, permissive rating would be only » step to compulsory rating. He thought there might be one or two large Government establishments for peculiar classes, but that the great mass of juvenüe offenders should be sent to schools where not more than 30 were associated together He was quite convinced that the only system to answer was the famüy system. Mr. MIOHELL opposed the Bffl. Mr. VERNON concurred in hoping that the Government would give ample time for persons in the country fuUy to know what they were about to do. He was not quite sure himself ttat the present system of reformatories established byvoluntarycontnbutionsand »ided by the Government was not preferable to the plan of permissive rating. Pennisaveratíng would ultimately lapse into compulsory raling.and the diihculty of religious teaching wonld necessarily follow. Colonol BUCK opposed the BUI on the ground ttat it would enable county magistrates, who were not responsible to the county ratepayers, to levy taxes upon them for tho benefit of other people. Sir E. KERRISON thought that the Government ought not to have introduced this measure untU the existmtr reformatory institutions had been further tested ; but as it had been introduced he was not disposed to offer any oodo«ition to it.

LONDON, SATURDA Y, FEB1RUABRY 21, 1857.
In the HouBe of Lords last night
Lord STANHOPE moved the appointment of a Select Committee to consider whether auy, and, if so, what improvements could be effected in the printing of the minutes and journals of the House, and especially as to putting upon record both the numbers and the names of the Peers who took part in the divisions.
Lord GRANVILLE agreed with the observations which had faUen from the noble Lord, and the motion was carried.
The Earl of HARROW13Y, in reply to Lord DUNoAxNox, stated that the Government had come to no final decision as to the division of the See of London; nor could he say positively what course they intended to pursue with regard to the superannuation and pensioning of aged bishops.
Some other business was also despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the Commons, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, an explanation took place betwveen Sir J. PAKWGTO2 and Sir C. WVOOD with reference to the condition of the troopship Megoera on her leaving Portsmouth.
MIr. LAYARD calUed the attention of Lord PALiIERsTox again to the reported Treaty between Persia and Russia, and inquired whether it was true that the negotiations witli Persia at Paris had been suspended or interrupted ?
Lord PALMExRsTox, in reply, repeated the answer he had formerly given on the first point, that the Government had no information upon the subject except what they had received from the public papers; and, with respect to the second question, it was not true, he said, that the negotiations at Paris with the Persian Ambassador had been interrupted or suspended; that the negotiations were still going on, and that there was no reason to entertain a diffferent opinion from that he had before expressed as to a fair prospect of a satisfactory arrangement.
The motion was agreed to.
On the order for going into a Committee of Ways and Means,
Mr. DISRAELT moved a resolution,-
" That it would be expedient, before sanctioning tho finaucial arrangemonts for the ensaing year, to adjust the estimated income and expenditure in a Imanner which shall appear best calcelated to securo the country against the risk of a deficiency in the years 1S53-9 and 1859-60, and ts provide for sach a balance of revenue and charge respectively in the year IS60 as may place it in the power of Parliament at that period, withoet embarrassment to the finances, altogether to remit the Income-tax."
He observed that, whatever differences of opinion might exist upon other questions, there was none upon one point, that our finances should be in a wholesome condition. He approved the course taken by the Government with respect to the war Income-tax, but he thought they should have announced their policy with reference to this tax earlier. He remindedthe Hlouse that he had to comment upon a financial statement essentially prospective, and his general objection to that statement was that its consequences showed that the remission of the Incometax in 1860 would be not only difficult, but absolutely impossible. The CHANCELLOR of tlle EXCEEQUER had estimated the expenditure of 1857-58 at 65,474,0001., and the revenue at 66,365,0901., leaving a surplus of revenue of between S00,0001. and 000,0001. But his (Mr. DISRAELI'S) estimate of the revenue and expenditure for the year 1858-59 was that, while the amount of the former would be 61,404,0007., the expenditure, including Exchequer Bonds, 2,000,0001., and Einking Fund, 1,500,0001., would be G6,389,0001. Consequently, upon the statement of the CgANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER himself (on Friday) there would be an apparent deficiency of 5,000,0001. in the year 1858-69 ; and he asked the House *whether, under these circumAsances, it was not its duty to examine the whole scope and tendency of the Government plan, and ascertain its probable result ? With such a deficiency in 1858-59 there must be a deficit of at least 10,000,0001. in 1859-60, the period at which the Income-tax, yielding 7,000,0001., was to be taken off, when a colossal deficiency would have to be grappled with. The obvious remedy was so to adjust the income and expenditure as to prevent this deficiency, and to remit the whole Tncome-tax. The CHANCELLOR of the ExcnaFQuER on Monday had assumed that the gross expenditure of 1858-59 would be the same as that of 1853-54-- Damely, 55,840,0001. 'Why, then, not reduce the -xpenditure of 1857-58 to that standard, -which would leave a surplus of 4,000,0(01. in the Exchequer without any addition to the duties on sugar or tea? If the CHANCELLoR of the EXCHEQUER had really determined to fall back upon the expenditure of 1853 there was no necessity whatever for any new tax, although the Estimates of that year were millions above those of Lord DE11BY'S Administration. He was for wise, not wild reduction; he did not propose any measure hostile to public credit or a vote of want of confidence in the Government; but he wished to support the CHAwCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER in his prudent policy of Mondp forgetting the awful Budget of Friday.
The CHANCELLORW of the EXcHEQuER observed that Mr. DISRAELI had, in his opinion, offered rcarcely any objection to the financial plana of the Governmlent. In his excuirsive flight he had commented upon the estimates of taxation for two successive years; but no Finance Mlinister had ever proposed to fix, or could fix, any plan of expenditure ,or a future year; that depended upon Parliament alone; so that, when Ur. DIsnAELI talked of adefici-
'ency in future years, he introduced an idea foreign 'to the subject. In order to show a deficiency, there must be a comparison between revenue and expenditure. He had stated on Monday that he estimated the revenue of 1858-59 at 62,300,0001., 'and that of 1659-60 at 62,265)0001., and he had compsred this estimate of revenue with the actual -expenditure of 1853-4-name]y, 55,840,0001., which showed an excess of revenue. If he had taken the *estimate of charge for the present year, it would have included eipenditure specially caused by peculiar circumstances, this being the first year after -the war. Premising, however, that he gave no -positive estimate and expressed no opinion of the expenditure beyond the present year, he stated -details showing its probabie amount in Bucceeding years, the result being that, according to reasonable -computation, and making allowance for arrange-ments for the redemption of debt, there was no probability of any deficiency, or of an impediment to the remission of the Income-tax in 1860. In that year he estimated that the revenue would be 58 115,0001., and the expenditure 54,200,0001. Con.sidering the resolution (the terms of which he criticized) to be uncalled for; that it would lead to no practical result, while it would be open to much nisrepresentation and misapprehension, he should neither affim nor deny it, but should vote for passinoa to the order of the day.
SIr. GLADSTONE said, no nian was more deeply concerned than he was in this question, which concerned a plan of finance in every part contradictory to that which he had proposed, and which had been adopted by the present House of Commons. The efforts of successiveAdministrationshad been directed to the consolidation and simplitication of the financial laws, whereas the CnH cELoR of the E1XcHEQuER had disinterred old ABTuun YOUNG, and had condemned the labours of Parliament for the last 15 years. The Income-tax, grievous and inquisitorial as it was, had been introduced to purchase blessings to be wrought out by its instrumentality. With what beneficial changes was it proposed now to associate this tax ?
The notion was that, this year, there would be a I remission of taxation to the extent of 11,970,0001.; but, omitting war taxes, to the amount of 4,470,0001., the cessation of -which was not due to the grace or favour of the Government, the remission of the Income-tax in 1857-58 woould be only 4,600,0001., against which was to be set 1,400,0001. to be laid upon tea and sngar; so that the real amount of taxes remitted in 1857-58 would be only 3;184,0001., and he was not satisfied that the supposed surplus of 900,0001. would be bom0 fide available. After entering into further financial details, and insistinig upon the obligation of Parliament to adhere to the stipulation entered into -with the country respecting the Income-tax, Mr. GLADSTONE proceeded to a closer criticism of the Budget, which discovered, he said, fatal flaws. The first and main defect was that it was based upon an excessive expenditure, and he gave notice that before going into committee he should propose that the estimates of expenditure should be revised and further reduced. He contended that 6,000,0001. had been added to the regular expenditure of the country, quite apart from the war, in four years-a fact, he observed, which suggested most serious reflections. In his opinion, the CHAsWMILOR of the ExcurQinin, in saying that he could not estimate the expenditure of a future year, though he could estimate the revenue, had trifled with the House and treated them like cbildren. Yet he had taken the expenditure of 1853-54 as that of 1858-59, which, for reasons stated by Mr. -GLADSTONE, he treated as a pure delusion, calctilating that the expenlditure of the latter year would exceed that of 1857-58, and that the real wants of the public service were likely to increase. The prospect for next year, taking the income and expenditure of the present, appeared to him to be that there would be a revenue, after deductions, of 61,065a,0001., to meet an expenditure of 66,724,0001., leaving a deficiency of more than 5,600,0001o., wFhich in 1800 would have au.- mented to 8,GOO,000I. Adverting to the views enunciated by the CHANCELLOR of the ExcaEQUER on the subject of indirect taxation-views which he strongly censured-Mr. GLADSTONE stated the amount of taxes remitted from 1842 to 1854 at 21,985,0001., or, deducting taxes imposed, 14,485,0001., added to the comforts or deducted from the privations of the. country, and the increase in the revenue had covered the whole amount of *remissions. Yet the Governnment now invited the Hiouse to retrace its steps, and to impose indirect taxes upon articles consumed by the labouring classes. To say, however, that the duties on tea and sugar should not be imposed ;was to say there should be a greater deficiency; this therefore increased his desire to support the resolution of Mr. DISRAELI, wvhich was in entire conformity with the pledge given regarding the Income-tax. He believed that by a wise economy it was practicable to relieve taxation, to reduce expenditure, and to maintain a surplus revenue.
Mr. w.ILSO, in replying to Mr. GLADSTONE, argued that the CHANCELLOP. of the EXXCHEQUER, in dealing with the tea and sugar duties, had not only acted upoIn sound principles, butupon the very principles ad' pted by Mr. GLADSTONE himself in 1853. These duties were really applied to war expenses. He pointed o01t what he considered to be errors on the part of Mr. GLADSTONE, insisting upon the fallacy which, he said, pervaded his speech of taking the expenditure of the present year as the basis of his calculation of the expenditure of years to come. He (Mr. WVILSON) justified the estimates formed by the CHANCELLOP. of the EXCHELquER for the years 185859 and 1859-60, which made the surplus in the first year 4,024,0001., and in the last 3,989,0001. Nothing had been done by the CHAN1TCELLOR of the ExcHEQoE'tto create a deficiency or to impede the settlement of 1853, sOfaras it could be carried into effect. The Budget, while it effectually provided for the expenditure of the present year, did not impair the meansof future finance Ministers to meet obligations.
Mr. LaING said the object he proposed to attain by voting for the resolution was that which was attained in 1848, when the Budget was sent back, and a new one produced, framied with a greater attention to economy. He pointed out the large increase in this year's estimates, compared with those of 1853-54, in departments unconnectedwith the war.
Oni tlhe motion of Mr. JAMrES MACGREGOR the debate was adjourned.
On the order for the second reading of the Reformatory Schools Bill,
Sir S. NiORTHCOTE suggested certain objections to the Bill,-not, however, opposing the second reading.
After a short debate the Bill was read a second time The HIouse, after some further business, adjourned *at 12 o'clock, until Monday.
We have no idea of being hard upon Mr.
We ha-,e no idea of being hard upon Mr. SFrQ9Ri.. He tmk a pretty corret view;, no
doubt, of the esteem in which his annual motion is held by many when he said that it-was called a "C complete nuisance ;" but there is sonietiing very respectable at the bottom of it, nevertheless. Not only is he truly sincere himself, but he represents the earnest and genuine convictions of a very large portion of his countrymen, as every election brings plainly enough to light. We perfectly understand and beheve that thousands upon thousands of people conceive the State committed to a work of actual sin in the Maynooth Endowment, nor is it very wonderful that they should make a corresponding stir about the proceeding. We admit, too, our entire persuasion that doctrines such as the hon. member described are to be found in the writings of Rouiish casuists, so that, after all these acknowledgments, he would be disposed perhaps to claim our adherence to his propositions. This, however, we must resolutely withhold, and repeat once more the opinion we have so frequently expressed, that, under the actual circumstances of the case, it is both expedient to continue the Maynooth Grant and unwise to struggle for its revocation.
We put our argument in half-a-dozen words
There stands Popery, and what is to be done with it ? It is not to be extirpated by violence, or suppressed by persecution. As Mr. RorBuco
remarked, our ancestors " tried every possible " means that cruelty and bigotry could induce to " root out Catholic doctrine," but failed. If
Popery, therefore, exists, there must be Popishpriests for the administration of its rites and sacraments; these priests must be either educated or uneducated, and if educated they must receive their education either at home or abroad, either in absolute. isolation from us and our institutions, or in some degree under the control or influence of the State. Here, then, is the alternative. The opponents of the Maynooth Grant do not profess intolerance; in fact, they should be the last persons to do so. They do not desire to deprive their fellow-countrymen of their religious freedom, and Mr. Ca.LitnEus even declared that he " would not have "complained of the Papal Aggression if it could have "been shown to be necessary in order that Roman "Catholics might receive all the sacraments and com"forts of their Church." As Popery, then, is not only to be tolerated, but, in so far as it is an expression of conscientious convicton, to be respected, ought its priests to be fairly outlawed in the matter of education, or ought they to be brought as far as possible within the pale? We cannot entertain a doubt on such a question. If there must be ministers teaching and propagating Popery it is better that they should be lettered than unlettered; better that they should be reared in home schools than brought up abroad; better that their views should be merely Popish than Popish and outlandish too.
" But what do we gain ?" vwill be asked by MIr. SrooNEn and his friends. " Where are the dis"tinct and tangible advantages to which we must "look for compensation? If we are asked for "more than toleration-if we are to give a posi"tive and substantial support to principles which
we sincerely condemn, and which we really "think cannot be encouraged without sin, show "us the considerations by which we are to be "justified." We reply that their sin, even on their own assumptions, is very small, and that their gains, even by their own showing, are by no means immaterial. What does this very debate show year after year? It shows that the chief Romish seminary, the only institution, as Mr. Seijeant SiEFE observed, " identified with the prevailing "creed of the community that possessed the ad"vantages of legal incorporation," can be brought with all its usages and forms of teaching under public cognizance. The books used in ihe College, the doctrines inculcated, and the st,ie of instruction followed, are periodically canvassed, and the authorities or their advocates put upon their defence. Mr. SPooxan himself referred to two Commissions which had been appointed to inspect and scrutinize every feature of the establishment. True, he is still dissatisfied with the results, but a Popish College must of course teach Popery, and it is hard to complain of Popery because it is adjusted pretty closely to the ideas of the PoPB.
We suspect there is no known quality of this article with -which Mr. SPooNEPR would be content, but for all this we maintain, as above asserted, that the acts of himself and his friends in this matter, viewed even as a positive support given to doctrines regarded as sinful, can involve no great offence against conscience. In plain words, the maintenance and preservation of Popery in no degree rest upon their shoulders. If the Romish Church in Ireland would cextainly come to an end but for the Maynooth endowment the case would be somewhat different, and the responsibility perhaps more difficult to bear; but if there was one thing admitted in the debate it was that the teaching and preaching of the Church in question would certainly be maintained, and that its priests, whether more or less educated, vwould certainly be forthcoming whether Maynootlh were endowed or not. The only difference would be, not in the vitality or vigour of Popery, but in the character which the ministers of that religion might generally possess. If a Maynooth priest is worse than a Douay priest, or a priest coming from any other foreign seminary, then the grant is chargeable with the consequences; but if he is better, as must surely be the case, then this muchdisputed endowment must be credited with the resulting advantage.
We have argued this question with almost exclusive reference to the most decided of the opinions entertained on the opposite side. We have said nothing about compacts, bargains, or any other subsisting obligations, but we de think that even from these points of view the feelings of the Irish people deserve attentive consideration. Without pushing the spirit of proselytism to excess, let it be granted that our aim should be to render our Irish fellow-countrymen as little alien as possible from the institutions which we ourselves prefer. That no such assimilation can be effected by oppression or ill-usage is plain from experience; but how surely it may follow from liberal and generous treatment was shown in Mr. Roanuou's remarkable declaration, that he
was almost ashamed to attribute the sentiment of loyalty to the people of Ireland. " When I say," he added, " that I am ashamed to use the word, I "mean that at this time of day any man should "be called upon to vindicate to his fellow-mden " the condnct of the Irish people." We may not be able to change Popery-the very boast, indeed, of its professors is that it is unchangeablebut, though the seed may remain the same, the actual fruit may depend wonderfully on the condition of the ground. As it is, we see that consequences marked out as inevitable do not real7y follow. It is all very well to quote Romisi4 writers and to push the maxims of Popery to evident conclusions, but this kind or argument is upset at once by suchI a (r M: as was asked by Mr. Bowvxn :-" Woulu
hon. gentleman say that practically Roi . "Catholics were less gcod subjects than Pro" testants ?" Mr. SrooWnE, in fe.hcr put one of the strongest points of the case against himself in his own speech when he dilated on the dreadful consewuences whieh would ensue if the doctrines taiglh. IX.onish book;s " were followed up." But these cowi,uences do not ensue, nor does any man
will ea CD and bQth the reason aild tLe
inference herein becomne perfectly clear. The docI trines are not " followed up," and the better people
are educated (evenx at Maynooth) the less chance ig there that they ever will be.
Does the country want a fresh Reform Bill?
Does the country want a fresh Reform Bill ? As a question of fact, we think not. Two great organic changes in our representative system almost within a quarter of a century would imply a rate of progress scareely in accordance with the gravity and the forecast of the English mind. Still less would they harmonize with those maxims of policy which have made England what she is, while the other nations of Europe have alternated between short, spasmodic fits, of what they called freedom and long periods of abject submission to civil or military despotism. That the popular element must and will gradually bear with increased force upon the administration of public affairs in this country is obvious enough. The whole question is one of time. If changes which are not desired by any, save a few hot political partisans, are thrust down the throats of a people reluctant, or at least indifferent, it is not difficult to foresee the result. The addition of political power to one scale means its subtraction from the other. The attempt would of course be violently reaisted, and, if carried through, would not be received in any spirit of very cheerful acquiescence by the defeated party. If, on the other hand, the change is onlyearried out when it is clear that such is the wiU of the majority of the nation, the end of the struggle is peace. The former possessors of power see that the time has arrived when they must share it with others, and they make up their minds to submit with as good a grace' as may be. Now, such a time has not yet arrived. We defy the most frantic zealot to assert with truth that there is anything lik-e a general-anything like a considerable desire, indeed, throughout the country for a Reform of Parliament. Where are the meetings? Where are the petitions ? Where is the general uneasiness, and the conviction that " something must " be done ?" In the days of the Roman Catholic Emancipation Bill-of the Reform Bil -of the Corn Bill, the very air was electric. Men talked, thought, dreamt of little else than the great public question of the day. Now o'days, on the contrary, the manufacturers, the farmers, the tradesmen are earnestly occupied with their own pursuits, and appear to have neither time nor inclination for any discussion of the subject. It will, no doubt, be a very simple matter for the half-dozen gentlemen whose reputation rests upon political agitation to get up halfa-dozen meetings in the great towns, where the machinery of agitation stands ever ready to be thrown into gear for a turn at Finaucial Reform, or general Peace principles, or, in fact, any subject which may seem convertible into a little political capital. There is, however, a great difference between the expression of public opinion elicited by this ingenious process and the expression of public opinion which makes itself heard throughout the land when the great heart of the English nation is roused to earnest action. Mr. LocsE Krnf and his friends may say what they will, but there is nothing yet to show that England desires a new Reform Bil.
This is the main objection to the Bill proposed by this gentleman in the House of Comnions on Thursday evening, and which the House refused him permission to bring in. We are not about to argue the merits of his proposition-its chief demerit was that it was made at all. Parliamentary Re,rorm is not one of those measures which must be forced on at all hazards. It is not like the problem of secondary punishments, which we must solve, and solve quickly, at the peril of our lives. WVith all the drawbacks, and all the ridicules of our present system of representation, no one can say that this country is not well governed. Dissenters may wish for a separation between Church and State; Churchmen require that the connexion should be upheld. One party is all for direct, another for indirect taxation; one for maintaining our armaments at a high point of efficiency, another for reducing them to a minimum, and so on throughout the round of our disputes. But does the House of Commons, or the House of Lords either, "stop the way?" We would add that nothing could be more fatal to the cause of real Parliamentary Reform than that it should be undertaken by fits, and be carried out piecemeal. With all its merits and all its drawbacks, our representative system is a whole. It has grown out of traditions, it is made up of compromises, in order that every class of the community may be represented, and nono absolutely swamped. The mathematical and geometrical mauner of proceeding would produce results which, however gratifying to the abstract sense of order, might not exactly promote the welfare of the country. It has been calculated, for example, that, upon the system of electoral districts, Lambeth would be entitled to return 40 members. Are we prepared for such a result? The representative system of England is a very complicated one, and when the question is entertained it must be looked at in al its bearings, and readjusted in such a way as shall do justice to aU parties. This result never can follow from putting on a patch here and stitching up a rent there.
The discussion which arose on MIr. LoCKE KiNo's proposition was, however, chiefly remarkable from the line taken upon it by Lord JOH}N RussELL and Sir JAn=S GRAHAM . True to the traditions of their former political history when in opposition, these two statesmen started forward to embarrass the Government by supporting Mr. LoCKE KING'S proposition,a proposition which, had they been in power themselves, they would have strenuously opposed. As far as Lord JoHN's argnment is intelligible, it appears to rest upon the foundation that, as the House throughout the session will have little or nothing to do, they may as well take a turn with Mr. Locan KiNG as with anybody else. Lord JoaN has no great belief that anything wiU come of the discussion upon education; the Government is not prepared to legislate upon agricultural statistics. There is no prospect of a row anywhere, or, to use Lord JoHn's own more Parliamentary phrase, " of disturbing the placid course of " events." When things are at the worst they will mend, however, and Lord Joan spits in his hand and clutches his stick immediately he seea his hon. friend MIr. KING trailing
his jacket through the fair, in hopes that somebody will tread upon the sleeve. Here, at last, is a chance of disturbing the "placid "couse of events" by breaking the head of one friend or another. The position of Lord JOHN Russ= in the House of Commons, after his many failures, must be a somewhat uncomfortable one. It is intelligible enough that, as a party man, and as seeking the chiefship himself, he should seek to throw difficulties in the way of his riv; , bL:t the time has not yet come. With I regard to Sir JAMNES GnAHAx, it is strange
find him praising his old antagonist with Lmost fulsome eulogies. Like Mrxs. JoHn ANDERSON in BuRNs's song, the Right Hon. Baronet was quite pathetic in bis recollections,-
"John Anderson, my jo, John,

Terrific Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.
TERRIFIC COLLTERY EXPLOSI ON NEAR BARNSLEY. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LIVES LOST.
LUNDRILL, FRrDAY XORNIG.
The fearful explosion on Thursday at Lundhll Colliery, rituate about four miles from Barnsley, will, vwe regret to learn, be attended with even far greater loss of life than stated in the telegraphic reportwbich appeared in 2Tc Times of this morning, the number of men and boys left in the pit, and beyond all doubt now dead, being ascertained to be about 170. The South Yorkshire collieries have become deplorably famous for terrible explosions, but, both with regard to the loss of life and other causes attendant upon it, tho present calamity is far more terrible than any of its predecessor3.
In M1arch, 1847, an explosion occurred at Ardsley Main Colliery, but a mile or two from Lundhill, by which 73 persons were killed. On the 24th of January, 1849, 75 lives were lost by a similar occurrence at Darley Main, also in the immediate neighbourhood; and on the 20th of December, 1851, 52 persons were killed by an explosion at the Warren Vale Colliery, distant only five or six miles from Lundhill. The present catastrophe, however, it is to be feared, has been well nigh as fatal as the whole of the three preceding ones put together, and is in every respect one of the most terrific, if not the most terrific calamity of the kdnd which has occurred in the kingdom for years.
The Lundhill Colliery is situate about half-.-mile north of the village of Hemingfield, and belongs to the finm of Taylor, Mandell, and,Co., who have recently assumed the title o' " the Lundhill Coal Company." It is about three years since preliminary proceedings were begun, and nearly two years since coal-getting operations were commenced. The sbafts were 200 yards deep. The bed of coal is a very rich one, and the works are proportionately extensive and complete. There are two working shafts and one air shaft, the latter being but a few yards from the principal working shafts. The draught down the working and up the air ehafts was pronmoted by a fan of unumsal magnitude; and the workings were ventilated in the ordinary way by main tramways to and fro, in opposite directions, with stoppings in the " benks," &c., to force the air into those parts where the men were at work. About 350 men and lads are em. ployed at the pit, and about 220 descended to work on Thursday morning. Of this number about 30 ascended at dinner time, leaving the number in the pit at the time of the explosion about 180.
The explosion took place about half-past 12 o'clock, while operations were suspended for dinner. It was accompanied by a report which was heard at the distance of two miles, and the whole neighbourhood was shaken as by an earthquake. A large proportion of the miners reside in the immediate neighbourhood, and thoso terrible manifestations, the cause of which they divined but too truly, struck famiHies with terror. Women and children rushed from their houses towards the pit in the wildest alarm. The news spread far and wide, and an immense concourse of persons were quickly collected on the spot.
The violence of the explosion having torn the drawing ropes, and blown the frame or chair in which the corves are drawn up into the head gearing, some hours were occupied In replacing the apparatus for descending the pit; when, about 4 o'clock, several men were let down they found 19 of the miners crowded about the bottom of the shaft, waiting to be drawn up. These were the fortunate few who had been working near the foot of the shaft. They were forthwith drawn up, and scores of shrieking women and children crowded round the place to see them ascend, screaming for joy, or sobbing with disappointment, a they recognized relatives or strangers. The sight was of the most harrowing description.
The names of those thus rescued are- George Warrinder, Abraham Levitt, William 13abershon, William Colbridge, John Simmonds, Thomas Oxberry and William, his son, William Hartley, Joseph Tunnercliffe, Thomas Hammerton, John IHammerton, John Ellis, Thomas Bell, Richard Wilkinson, Henry Hutchings, Henry Nixon, Henry Chipchase, John Booth, and Joseph Childs.
Simmonds aud three others were dangerously injured, but the majority of them have escaped scathiess.
In the meantime the men who had descended the pit penetrated 400 or 502 yards along the main tramways to ascertain the state of the mine, and were then forced to Jecede by the density of the sulphur. They pick-ed up 13 dead bodies in the tramways, some of them frightfully mutilated. Among them were those of John Frost, John Halliday, Charles Kennett, and Joe Kennett, his son. So far as they could ascertain, the force of the explosion had extended over the whole of the workings. They found the ventilation " stoppings" with the " benks" and boardways all blown out, and the earth and coal tern down in large masses, so as to effectually stop the course of ventilation in those parts of the pit where the miners had been at work. The consequence was that the workings were so charged with sulphur that it was utterly impossible to penetrate them; and any of the men wiso might uot be killed by the primary effects of the explosion were necessarily left to perish miserably by the noxions gases.
While these measisres were being taken in the hope of rescuing the poor fellows in the pit, a feature in connexion with the catastrophe, of an unusual character, developed itself. As already stated, the air shaft is but 30 or 40 yards from the principal working shaft. It is surmounted by a capacious chimney some 20 feet in height. From 2 to 3 o'clock volumes of smoke were observed to issue from the air shaft, and this was succeeded at a later hour by an immense volume of flame. So tremendous had been the accumulations of inflammable gases in the pit that they had set the coal on fire, and it was blazing from a depth of more than 200 feet right out of the chimney top-a feet from which some idea may be gathered of the magnitude and intensity of the fire. The flames increased in volume until about 7 o'clock, when they rose to the height of 50 or 60 feet above the top of the chimney, illuminating the whole neighbourhood. A large quantity of wood had been used in the lining of the air shaftk and the fire threw up to the height of some hundreds of feet an immense shower of sparks and burning pieces of wood, visible for miles round. The flames became so fierce as to threaten the destruction of an accumulation of coal and timber about the pit hill, and telegraphic messages were forwarded to Sheffield for fire-engines to prevent such an extension of the fire; but measures were in the meantime adopted which rendered their services unneces sary.
It became obvious that unless somethinga were done to cat off the draught by which the flames were being blown into momentarily increasing fury the fire must spread in the internal parts of the pit with fearful rapidity. In this state of affairs a conference of the proprietors and managers was held, and it was determined at once to close the mouths of the working shafts, through which air was drawn into the pit. This resolution was carried into effect in the most prompt manner. Planks of wood having been placed over the mouths of the shafts, loads of gravel were carted to the spot, and heaped upon the planks by scores of busy hands. So urgent was this step that it was not even delayed to raise the corpses, which had been carried to the bottom of the principal shaft. The success of the plan was speedily apparent. The flames began to abate almost before it was completed, and by half-past 8 o'clock had altogether disappeared from above the surface. It is to be feared, however, that the fire wiU continue to smoulder in the interior of the pit for some days, if not weeks.
The necessity of preventing all ventilation until the fire shall have altogether subsided, and the dilapidated state of the workings in consequence of the explosion, wil in all probability render it impossible to attempt for some days the recovery of the bodies of the 170 poor fellows who are stiU in the pit ; and there is consequently little, if any, chance that 5ny of them willbe saved, though it is not impossible that some of them in those parts of the mine most remote from the point where the explosion originated might survive for some time.
Almost simultaneously with the opening of the pit, long rows of cottage houses sprung up in its immediate vicinity, and are inhabited chiefly by miners and their families. The founds of " weeping and wailing" which issued from these dwelings on the evening of the explosion, when it became manifest that the persons still left in the pit were hopelessly lost, were truly heart-rending.
LATEST PARTICULABS.
LU\DHILL, FIUDAY, 4 p.m.
The two worldn g shafts of the colliery remain covered at the mouth with earth, as they were last night, to prevent any draught of air getting into the pit to fan the fire. It appears from statements made by the men, who explored the minb yesterday evening, that the coal was on fire over an ara of 50 or 60 foet around the bottom of the air shaft, and the smoke stiU continues to ascend from the mouth of the shaft. It is, however, confidently expected that the fire will be extinguished in the course of a few days, and when this is done means will be at once taken to recover the bodies stil in the pit. As the result of farther inquiries, it appears that the pit was carefully examined by Mr. Coe, the underground steward, on the morning of the explosion, and nothing at all indicative of danger was perceived. The scam
of coal is what is called a "fiery" one (i. c., contains a large quantity of inflammable gas), but ths mine was so well Tentilated that the draught in the airways was often sufficiently strong to blow out a lighted candle. Naked candles, and not Davy lamps, were used in many instanoesby the miners, but this was considered perfectly safe.
Lae numbers of miners and the managers of several nqiZYWV!ing clleries, immediately on hearing of the
catstrophs yesterday, went to t1e ALt2dhMi Cloety t, render assistance, and were most venhtesome ad&-znwearied in their exertions. The following are t6e name2 of the persons who explored the mine ahortly afft fthe aceci dent :-Mr. Webster, of the Hoyland and Elsocar eullieriee, Mr. Maddiaon, ranager of the Wombwell Maino Colenry; Mr. J. Hoyland, of the Warren-vale collieries; Mr. B, Hoyland, Joihn James, and Ellis Wilcock, of the DaAey, Maine collieries; W. Dnckworth, of the Wombwell Maine' collieries; Charles Cookson, of the E[oyland mines; and James Harris.
The closing up of the montia of the two worling shafts on Thursday evening, without taking out the number of dead bodies which had been carried to the bottom of the principal shaft, was a step- taken on the advice of Mr. Webster and Mr. MJaddison. St reason urged-were that, as the fire was blazing with great vehemence, rmore especially frorm that part of the mine lying between the principal drawing shaftand the air shaft, there wasgreat danger,in caseof delay, that the coal between the two &safts would give way, let down the earth, and thns cause the shafts to fall in, a result which would have rendered it not only impossible to work the pits any further without sinking now shafts, but also impossible to recover the bodies of the unfortunate men stiU in the pit. To day, on the invitation of the proprietors of the coUiery, the foRowing colliery managers and viewers met to consider this step :-Mr. Woodhousc, of Derby; Mr. Day and Dr. Webster, of HoYland; Mr. W. Maddison, of Wombwell Maine Colliery; Mr. Ralph Maddison, of Worsbroughdale and Sil'sstone CoUiery; Mr. Thomas Cooper, of Eawmash; Mr. Sellars, of the Haigh; Mr. R. Child and Mr. Cam, of Wakefield; Mr. Hartop, of Barnbrough-haU ; and Mr. Holt, of Walefield; and, after hearing tfje reasons which led to the step being taken,.rere unanimously of opinion that it was the only proper course to adopt under the circumstances, and that any attempt to rescue the few' bodies brought to the bottom of the shaft would have been an extremely dangerous experiment.
It was announced that a subscription would at once e commenced for the benefit of the widows and orphans of ihe sufferers by the calamity, and that the subscriptihn. would be headed by a donation of 500f. from the membera of the Lundhill Coal Company. It has been rumoured that several of the men who were taken out of the pit alive died last evening, but no irnformation to that effect had reached the managerof the colliery.
The following are the names of the men and boys still in the pit, so far as they have been ascertained:-Charles. Richard, Thomas, and Joseph Kellett, all of Hemingfield, brothers; Thomas and Richard Kellett, sons of the above Richard KlleUett; Thomas Kellett, son of the above Thomas Kellett; James and Samuel Hunt, of Lundhill, brothers; Barnet Bailey, of Lundhill, and his son; John and Stewart Russell, of Hemingfield, brothers; Charles, Edward, and James Walker, of Lunddhill, brothers; Joseph Smith, of Lundhill; James and John Smith, sons of the above; Israel and John Hobson, of Lundhill, father and son; Henry and Charles Barraclough, of Lundhill, brothers; William and George Maughan, one of Wath, and the other of Melton, brothers ; Joh n and Joseph GrimEhaw, of Wombwell, brothers; Charles and James Cootes, of Wombwell, brothers; Thomas and WiUiam Pollard, of Wombwell, father and son; William and John Llingworth, of Lundhill, father and son; Thomas Dunstan, of Jump, and Richard Dnnstan, of Broomhill, brothers; John Cutt, of Lundhill, and Wiliam, John, and George Cntt, father and sons ; William ThompEon, of Melton ; George Scholey, of Lundhill; Thomas and George Gee, of Heming6eld, brothers; George Shepherd, of Lundhill; John Livesey, of Wombwell; DavidHowitt, of Hemingfield; Thomas Wilkinson, of Lundhill; John Pettifield, of Jump; Stephen Turner, of Hemingfield; WilliamnWilkinson, of Lundhill; Samuel Parkinson, of Wombwell; William Monks, of Lundhill; Elija Beevers and Benjamin Beevers (brothers), of Lundhill; Robert Burland, of West Melton; Thomas Naylor, of Hemingfield; James Hunt, of LundhiUl; John Frost, of West MIelton; Ezra Illingworth, John Wilkinson, Thomas Fawkes, and Joseph Goodall, aU of Lundhill; Samuel, Sampson, Thomas, and George Law, all of West Melton, brothers; John Carr, of Lundhill; Johnx Thompson, of Jump; Joseph Child, of Stairfoot; John Bellamy, of Wath; George Thompson, of Jump; Charles Coults and John Pollard, of Woinbwell, Eddward, William, and John Garbutt, aU of Lundhill, father and two sons; Edward Trainer and Michael Barnes, of Hemingfield; John Thompson, of Wath; William Wigfield, of Hemingfield; John Beevers, of Wombwell; Samuel Hunt, of LundhiUl; Thomas Drury, of Wombwell; John Hobson, John Scott, Thomas Naylor, aud George Gill, of Heming'

(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDE. I
(A portion of the foUowing appeared in our second edl. ton of yeaterday:-]
PARIS, THUUI,MAY, FXB. 19, 6 r-.
Various accounts have gone the round of the papers with respect to the alleged movements of Feruk EKhan, the Persian Ambaseador. According to one version he was abouttoleaveParis immediately for London, after having brought his conferences with Lord Cowley to a satisfactory conclusion; another went so far as to name the street in London and even the number of the house, in which hie was to take up his residence; a third, that he had already packed up his baggage, and was to have left Paris this day or tomorrow, but that some new difficulty had occurred, which would postpone his journey for some few days more, or indefinitely. None of these accounts is strictly correct. No day was fixed for Feruk Khan's departure for London. There has been very little or nothing said about his departure at all, and, in point of fact, the " difficulty" has been pretty much the same from the commencement of the negotiations to the present moment. The Orientals, as many know to their cost, are never very expeditious in their diplomacy, and I doubt much whether Feruk Khan is an exception. The basis of the pending negotiations may be modified by the last news from Teheran; but, notwithstanding the delay, it is hope that anl arrangement is still within the limits of probability. Notwithstandingthe doubts I have Jst expressed, I give you the following paragraph from the Government evenig paper:-
" Several joarnals have announced that the Anglo-Per. sian difference is ia a fair course of orrangement. We beHeve we may announce, according to our private information, that the principal difficulties are at present arranged, and that an understanding has been come to on both sides u to the conditions on which peace is to be re-established. We expect in a few days to know the terms of the de finitive arrangement."
Accounts from the shores of the Caspian state that the 13th Division of Russian Infantry, under the orders of General Chruleff, took up a position on the 28th of January at Djabal, at the confluence of the Araxes and the Kour. On the following day Abberad Ehan, sent by the Governor of Farsistan on a private mission, had a long conference with General Chruleff at the head-quarters of the latter.

RUSSIA.
The following ukhse has been issued by the Emperor Alexander II. of Russia relative to the concession of the railways in Russia:-
" In our solicitude for the interests of our country, who3e prosperity we have at heart, we lung since recognized that Russia, bounteously gifted by nature, felt espe cailUy, in consequence of her immense extent of territory, the want of easy means of communication.
" This conviction was strengthened in consequence of the labours in wrhich we have personally taken part since 1842, when the will of our august father, of glorious memory, called upon us to preside over the committee on railways charged to report upon the construction of the line from St. Petersbarg to Mloscow and others.
"The construction itself of that line, which now so justly bears the name of the Emperor Nicholas, has given additional proof of the advantages of this new means of communication for our country; its usefulness in time of peace as weU as in time of war. Railways, of which the urgency was questioned not 10 years since, are now recognized by all classes of the population to be a necessity for the empire, andhave become a national want eagerly desired by all.
' Penetrated with this deep conviction we ordered, as soon as hostilities had ceased, that the most efficacious measures should be taken to satisfy this imperious nececsity. A oreful investigation has shown the advantage there would be, under the double aspect of facility and promptitude, in folowing the example of other countries and intrustngthem to privat3 enterprise, national as well as foreign, the latter offering moreover the great experience already acquired by the constraction of many thousand versts of railway in Western Europe.
" Various offers have been tendered upon this basis, and after a careful examination by a committee of Ministers and a discussion in our presence, the conditions unanimously declared the best and sanctioned by us are those of the company of Russian and foreign capitalists at the head of which is our banker, Baron de Stieglitz.
"According to the terms of these conditions, the company engages to construct, at its own risk and expense, within the term of 10 years, and to keep up afterwards for 85 years, a net work of railway of 4,000 versts, under the sole guarantee of the Government of five per cent. on the capital laid out In the construction, and with the clause that on the expiration of the said term the whole of the lines shall become gratuitously the property of the State.
" Avoiding the necessity of considerable and immediate sacrifices, the Government in adopting these conditions wiU be enabled to effect the construction of the first network of Russian railways by the sole force of the confidence inspired by the punctuality with which it has always f ulfiled its engagements, even during the worst periods of national struggles.
" This network will extend from' St. Petersburg to Warsaw and to the Prussian frontier, from Moscow to NijniNovgorod, from Moscow by Kourak and the region of the Lower Danube to Theodosia, and from Koursk or Orel by Dunaborg to Libau. Thus, by means of a continuous line of rail through 26 governments there wil be connected three capitals, our principal navigable rivers, the central pointe of our agricultural produce, and two ports accessible nearly al the year round on the Black and Baltic Seas; exportation will be facilitated, aud transport and the supply of provisions at home assured.
"Undertaking, in the firm hope of the blessing of the Almi"hty, so vast and beneficent a national enterprise, we appeal to the zealous and conscientious co-operation of al our faithful subjects, and order the execution of:-
" 1. The act containing the fundamental conditions of the concession of the first network of Russian railways.
" 2. The statutes of the Grand Society of Russian Railways organized for the above-mentioned constructions.
"The act and statutes are annexed to this present ukase.
"The Senate will take the necessary steps in this matter.
" ALEXAEDER. St. Petersburg, Jan. 26,1857."
The statutes consist of 51 articles. The 7th article fixes the capital at 275,000,000 of silver roubles, consisting of shares of 125 silver roubles. The first issue of shares is to be 600,000, as follows
Shares. Stieglitz and Co., at St. Petersburg and Warsaw 225,000 Baing Brothers, London- 170,000 Thomas Baring (forHope and Co.. Amsterdam)" 70,000 Pereire and Thurneyssen (for Mendelssohn at

Total ,. 600,000 PERSIA.
The following is the " Manifesto " of the Persian
Government, which appeared in the Telieran Gaznet,e of the 8th of January:-
" In th course of the complications which have arisen
behtwen Persia and England the Persian Goverment in
every respect has perfectly fulfilled ita duties of friendshipI and good relationship towards the British Government, and
has negledted nothing to maintain a good understanding-, It was with the consent of his Cabinet that on his arrival
at Constantinople the tPersian Aasbuador, the Emin-ou' Moulk Ferk Rshzn, exerted all his efforts, and went to the extreme limit his full powers permitted hIm to do, in
concesions to the English Goverm ent, as far as thed inity of his country would alloWhim, hoping terebTto mintain
undisturbed the friendly relations existing for so many years between Persia and Great Britain.
" We entertain the hope that all these efforts made by the Persian Government and by its Ambassador will be brought consecutively to the knowledge of all the Powers which entertain a sentiment of justice, and that they will then acquire the certitude that we are not to blame for a rupture of our friendly relations with the English nation.
"But the British Government would like to see subjected to its will andto its views every country of the world; the more moderation and consideration that is shown towards it, which it looks upon as weakness, the higher does it raise its imperious demands. This is why the straightforward conduct of the Persian Government and all the efforts of Feruk Khan have proved abortive. The conferences between him and the English Ambassador had not terminated and the question of peace or war was not yet deoided when a body of English troops suddenly attacked Bender-Bushire, and seized upon a place which the Persiau Government had left undefended, without increasing its usual garrison.
" The Persian Government is much astonished at this mode of proceeding, and asks vhat public law sanctions a great Power to allow its Ambassador to open negotiations, and at the same timo to invade with an army a friendly State, and thus, without a cause, break solemn treaties?
" Seeing after this the uselessness of its friendly and straightforward measures, and feeling persusded that England would not relinquish her ideas of conquest, the Persian Government finds itself at last under the necessity oE having recourse to the grace of the Ahlmghty, and of taking every means in its power to defend the country and the nation, and firmly to resist an insolent enemy, and not to flinch from any sacrifice in the cause of the faith and of the country, so as not to give them and their holy religion up easily to ignominy and dishonour, until God shAll dispose of them according to Mis supreme wilL
" It is evident that it was not the obiect of the Persian Government to offend an alied Power, or to find a pretext to infringe on treaties, or to renew old sores and cause human bloodshed. Whichsoever of the two parties shall have provoked this great oalanity will be judged by the decrees of the Most High. The Persian Government has not neglected, and will not neglect for the future, to send leaders and sunilcient troops and artillery, and to take evory possible measure to drive away the enemy. Among others, the illustrious Mlrza-Kahomet-Khan, Serke. chiktchi-Bachi (commander of the body-guard) of His Majesty, and the illustrious Emir-i-touman Fezi-Ali. Chan-B6glarb6gui have been sent into the province of Fars to take the necessary measures of defenre. Trusting in the goodness of God, they left the capital ox the 18t of January for their destination, and if England persists in her unwarranted hostility the other points and localities of the said province will not at least be defenceless, as was the case at Bender-Bushire, and will not serve as an exercising. ground for the En&lish troops. Supposing England should return to peace this expedition will not, in any case, have caused more considerable losses than those which English conquests in this country would cost us."

There was considerable animation at the Stock Board, with an advance in some descriptions. In railroad shares the market was lower than for some weeks past. Land warrants continued in active demand, with a very moderate supply.
At St. Louis intelligence had been received from Santa F6 to December 27th. The Legislature of New Mexico organized on the 3d of December; Fernando Pino was re-elected President of the Council, and Rolez Speaker of the House. The corn crop was abundant. Indian depredations continued. The Gazette, alluding to this subject, says, that the Governor is either grossly ignorant of the territory, or intends to mislead the Government.

Friday Evering.
The Enghlsh funds opened at an improvement of an eighth this mornIng, the market being supported by the notification of the Bank having resolved to make their usual quarterly advances not only on bills, but on other securities, at 6 per cent. Speculative sales, however, for the purpose of c.,ntracting some of the large accounts recently entered into for a rise, continued to check the tendenmy to animation; and, notwithstanding the receipt of good quotations from Paris, some dulness was manifested towards the close. Consols for money were first quoted 93k to J. From this they receded to 93k, and the last prices were 93k for money, and 93i for the 6th of March. Bank Stock left off at 218i to220; Reduced,93 to 94; New Three . Cents., 94i to i; India Stock, 219 to 222; Ex. chequer-bonds, 98 to I; India Bonds, 2s. dis. to ls. pm.; and Exchequer-bills, s. to 4s. pm.
Foreign securities were steady. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 951, J, and i; and the Four per Cents. Guarauteed, for money, at 101i. The general business comprisel -Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 97i; Danish Five per Cents., 104; Mexican, for money, 22k; for the account, 22k, 22, and 22i; Peravian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 80; the Three-per Cents., for the account, 55; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97k; Spanish Three per Cents., 40k, i, and i tho New Deferred, 24 and i; Passive, ; the eikiiintes, 6 d, +, and6; and Dutch Two-and-a-Ralf per Cents., .
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Holland were a shade lower. With regard to Paris there was a alight improvement. Other places showed no important change.
The corn-market this morning was without alteration.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69?. 80c. for money, and 70f. for the end of the month, showing a further improvement of a half per cent.
The specie brought by the Magdalena to-day Is 176,0001., of which only 96,0001. is silver. It appears that Her Majesty's ship Trincomalee, which was expected at Panama with a large amount of silver from the West Coast of Mexico for transmission by this mail, had not arrived. She was expected, however, in the course of a week, and her supply may possibly, therefore, be brought by the Orinoco, which will be due at Southampton about the 3d of March.
Some further particulars published to-day regarding the Russian Railway scheme are calculated to confirm the disregard with which the whole affair appears likely to be received. In the Stock-Exchange it has thus far seemed scarcely to be considered worthy of the slightest attention. The fact that nearly 3,000 miles are proposed to be completed in l 0 years, at an allowance for the principalportion of less than 15, 0001. a-mile, subject to allthe exactions of Russian offcials, and with a guarantee, reckoning the requisite sinking fund, of only 4i per cent., should, under any circumstances, be sufficient to deter even the most insatiable speculators; but if additional motives for abstinence were needed they would be abundantly furnished in the minor details. While the money is to come chiefly from foreign subscriptions, its administration is tobe practicaUy in the hands of Russians only, since, according to the statutes of the company now put forth, 10 out of the 20 directors must be natives, who will direct its proceedings from St. Petersburg while from the remainder a council may be formed at Paris. Even such foreign influence as is contemplated will be almost entirely French. With regard, however, to the privilege of contributing funds, England is to be allowed a leading position. Of the first 12,000,0001., 4,500,000l. is to be subscribed at St. Petersburg. Lbndon is to figure for the next largest sum-namely, 3,400,0001. Paris is content to be permitted to offer 2,500,0001. Amsterdam, where Russian securities have hitherto found their best market, proposes to take only 1,400,0001., and Berlin, which may be regarded as the place where everything Russian is most truly appreciated, limits herself to 200,0001. In his ukase on the subject the Emperor Alexander congratulates his people that this great enterprise will become practicable owing to the credit Russia has attained by " the punctual exactitude with which she has always fulfilled her engagements," but it is necessary to recall that her foreign debt up to the present time has been of very limited amount, and that it was found during the war that the market for her securities was a narrow one. It must likewise be remembered that the history of the Russiau paper' currency does not entirely support the character assumed for a faithful fulfilment of financial engagements, and that more recently the breach of the commercial obligations undertaken in the interest of Europe, withregard to the Sulina navigation, has tended to weaken the claim to confidence. Discarding these reminiscences, however, which might have been suffered to lie dormant had thev not been challenged, and assuming that all the proposed conditions might be carried out on every side with exactness, it is impossible to conceive that any person of ordinary reputation for prudence wil be found in this country ready to subscribe. With capital everywhere in demand, and daily opportunities of entering into colonial and continental projects that offer guarantees of 5 or 6 per cent., with reasonable probabilities of a constantly increasing return, it seems incredible that Englishmen wil be ready to bury money in Russian undertakings, wholly removed from their knowledge or supervision, with the certainty that under the best circumstances they can never receive more than 4i per cent., and with the contingency of being obliged to be content with less.
The additional accounts from New York by the Arago to-day describe no material alteration in the money-market. The transactions in railway stocks had not been important, and, with the exception of Illinois Central, there had been an average decline of about one per cent.. Erie was quoted 0 to 61, Panama 94, Neew York Central 90# to 91, Reading 80 to 81, aud IlUinois Central 135 to i. The importation of goods from Europe had been large. Business had not quite recovered from the interruption caused by the recent severity of the weatheru; but there was a favourable feeling as to the prospects of the spring demand. The present steamer has brought 60,0001. specie, purcbased by Messrs. Roths&bild's agent on French account. From Nicaragua the intelligence was to the 17th of January, being about a week later than that previously received. It consists, however, of little more than rumours. The Costa Ricans are alleged to have inflicted a further blow on Walker, by seizing his steamer, the Sierra Nevada, which has hitherto conveyed to him his recruits from California.
In the colonial produce markets during the week there has been a steady, although a comparatively limited business, and prices have in several instances experienced a further advance. Sugar is without change, excepting for low and soft descriptions, which have been disposed of at a slight reduction. The proposed alteration in the duties next April appears to have entirely checked the speculative inquiry for floating cargoes and foreign refined. Coffee still attracts much attention, the reduced stocks here and late advices from Rio Janeiro, Ceylon, &c., imparting additional firmness. Four floating cargoes of Rio have realized enhanced quotations, and a considerable quantity of native Ceylon has changed hands at an improvement of is. Cocoa is agan much higher. There has been a fair iquiry for rice, In whtch white kinds have at length participated, and prices are ratherfirmer. In. saltpetre the transactions ha-ve bencnRd
ab]e, at an advance of 6d. to Is. Nitrate of soda is also higher. Nothing of interest has transpired in spice. The quarterly sales of indigo were concluded on the 19th, and, considering the state of the money-market, the result is looked upon as satisfactory, 5,500 chests finding buyers out of 12,909 declared. The attention of theimporters, dealers, and others interested in tea has been chiefly directed to the movement in favour of a fixed duty of ils 4d.
during the next three years, in lieu of the alterations proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The public sales have been postponed, and privately only a small business has taken place out of the recent arrivals. Some speculative purchases are, how ever, reported in common congou, at is. 0&d., and the price closes at 1s.0 d. per l. To-day a petition, with 500 signatures, including all the mercantile houses connected with the trade, was delivered to Lord John Russell for presentation to the House of Commons, the main point urged being the adoption of the-fixed duty.
Considerable purchases of silver are being made for tho India mail of the ,4th of March, to be paid
for on the 2d, sO as to enable the houses to telegraph the circumstance to their correspondenta by the present mail.
At a meeting of the East India iron Comnpany,
held to-da, Mr. R. W. Crawford in the chair, the tepot andacc6untswere adopted. Thoprogress of operations is stated to be more encouraging, and the new works which are about being brought into actlvity will largely increase the produce. The attempt to introduce the manufactre of bar iron at Beypore by theStyrian methods has proved afailire, through the inefficiency of the native workpeople, but in other respects results are satisfactory. Arrangements have been made with the Madras Railway Company for supplying chairs and other materials for the use of that undertaking, while in this country a ready market is found for the pig iron as it arrives at remunerative prices. The directors express an opinion that the tiue is not distant when the shareholders will receive a return for their invested capital.
Messrs. Croskey and Co., not having yet succeeded in inducing the Post-office to make up a mail-bag for the Hamburg and Brazil line of steamers which call at Southampton, leaving that port for Lisbon and Brazil on the 24th of each month, propose detaining the Petropolis, appointed for the 24th inst., until the arrival of Monday's letters from Liverpool andMancheater at Southampton, for the convenience of merchants at those places, who, from the refusal of the Post-office to make up a mail, would otherwise have been obliged to close their correspondence on Saturday.

Olympic Theatre.
OLYMPIC THEAT.aE.
The new drama, produced on Thursday night, with the title 4 Sheep in Wolf's Clothirng, is a version by Mr. Tom Taylor of Unc F emme jui d6taste son ssar, of which, this week, we have already an almost literal translation at the Haymarket. Mr. Taylor's work has been that of an adapter, not of a mere trans. Iator. He shifts the scene of action from Paris to the west of England, and thrusts back the time from the days of Bobespierre to those of Judge Jeifreys. The gentleman who hides in the cupboard is a British Monmouthite instead of a French Girondin, and his strong-minded wife, in lieu of being a sham Jacobin, is a simulated Tory. As for the citizen, whose fate in the original is so closely linked with that of Robespierre, he becomes very historical indeed -being converted into no less a personage than Colonel Kirk himself. When the tale approached its conclusion one felt rather nervous as to how the ingenious adapter would keep up his paraUel between the Reign of Terror at Paris and the general panic in the western counties. The foppish citizen of the Republic, who is the evil principle throughout the orignal piece, is baffed by the Dictator. But how was Colonel Kirk to be annihilated? Mr. Westland Marston could well save his imaginary hero in A Lifo's Bansomn by making the Prince of Orange land at Torbay ; but it would be rather awkward to bring this event into the middle of the " Bloody Assizes." The difficulty is solved by Mr. Taylor with exceeding dexterity. Nobody faUs, except Kirk himself, who is deprived of his command, and, as the order is brought by Colonel Lord Churchill, of the Life Guards, the story grows more intensely historical than ever, for the audience have an opportunity of seeing the great Duke of Marlborough in his youth. Never probably was there an instance of a French piece more thoroughly ". done into English." lNever was there a more complete change from the topboots of one age into the iackboots of another. The dialogue is entirely rewritten, ind absolutely bristles with allusions to the Monmoath rebeUion and those especial horrors that give it a character quite distinct from that of the reign of Robespierre. WVhether the plot is as weU suited to the older as to the later period may admit of some doubt. A fenale fanatic, loving the Republic above all things, and detesting an aristocrat, is, perhape, a more conceivable character than a Tory lady hating a Whig. As for the amusing servant, Finot. there is no doLbt that he loses everything by being transformed from a rampant Jacobin of .Paris into a west country bumpkin -with no attribute at all.
However, granting the piece was to be made Englishthat we were to have an "imitation de bonne foi" in liea of a translation-we do not see how the transformation could have been more ingeniously effected than by Mr. Taylor. To some extent the relative value of the characters is changed by the new version. The husband, who is played by Mr. George Vining at the Olympic, has been made a more heroic personage than in the original, while the perpetual contrast between the real and the assumed character of the wfe, who is made up as a superb English damne, by MIrs. Stxrhng, seem less strongly marked. On the other hand, the urly gallantry of Koirk (represented by Mr. Addison) is more characteristic than the foppery of the Jacobin beau.
Altogether, though the main plot of the Haymarket and the Olympic versions is precisely the same, save by a modi. fication that ingeniously gets rid of the exceedingly French divorce, the impression produced is entirely different. There is a lightness in the original (and consequently in the Hay. market version) in spite of the serious nature of the incidents; there is an historical substantiality in Mr. Taylor's version i spite of the imagiary character of the plot, and thispeculiarityis heightned by the scenes and the costumes, which completely transplant us to another age. The success of A Shleep in Wolf 's Clothing is unequivocal.
Garotte Robbery At Chatham.-Yesterday
GAROTTI2 ROBBERY AT CEATHAINI. -Yesterday three men, named Frederick Toole, Ambrose Lee (alias
Gipsy Lee", aud John Reading, were brought before the tEarlof aniy and the other county magistrates at Rochestkr charged wth being concerned in a daring garotte attack on Lieutenant T. Bent, an officer belonging to the Obatham divison of ROYal hdarines, aid in command of the marines serving on board Her Majesth's ship Iris at Chatham. Lieutenant Bent e tated that he was wF-rg through HBigh-street, Chatham, between 12 and 1 o'clock on Thursday momring, when, on passing near the Sun-pier, Be was suddenly seized by the throat from behinid, and at the same instant two other men, shomr he identifiel ts Lee and Reading appeared in front of him and comienced rifling his pockets. Although, from the manner in which he was seized and held, he was almost powerless, yet, being an athletic man, Lieutenant Bent made a determined resistance and struggld ewith his aalants, who, however, knocked him down, and inflicted soveral ici,k about his head and body, one of the kicks severely injuring his eye. The miscreants then gained posission of his wateh and coain, whioh were very valuable; but, fortunately, a suma of 631., which iennutenant Bent had in his pocket scaped their observation. The thieves were imakinig oFf wheni the prosecutor regained his feet, and another sArugg'le ensued between them, but Lieutenant Bent succeededI in closing with Toole, whom he secured, and held until assistanc arrived, The other prisoners were apprehended the same morning, one of them, p_&-&mg) being emiployed in Chathamn dockyard as a baminerman. Thle watch anid chiain have niot beenL recovered, After hearing the statement of Lieutenant Bent tbe m isrtsrmned the prsoners until this day,

The 21st annual meeting of this institution 'was beld on Thursday last at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate.utreet, Alderman W. T. Copeland, V.-P., in the chair. The meeting of governors vwas unusuaUy numerous, and among those gentlemen present were observed John Masterman, Es,
Duke, Bart., M.P., V.-P., Sir C.FP Roney, Captain Ross, R.E., G. Glas Sandeman, Esq. (chairman of the Committee of the Hospital), Jobn Griffith Frith, Eeq. (deputy-.bairman), Rev. George Taylor (chaplain), Dr. Spurgua (honorary phXssicrn), Thomas Oak, Esq., M.D., George Hlolgate Foster, Stacey Grimaldi, Thomas Tilson, Henry i-l. Briggs, James Cook, Frederick Green, Jamues Bruce, Robert AlexAander Gray, George Sandeman, Willam Burbidge, Richard Fisher, W. C. Lockner, Robert Blunt, George Smith, Esqs., &o.
The Chairman said that, aware as he was that most of the gentlemen present were engaged in the pursuits of commerce and business, he would not trespass upon their time with many preliminary observations. It was, however, customary for the chairman on occasions hkie the present to make a few remarks, and he would be very brief in those he had to make. He congratulated the meeting upon the fact that this noble charity had attained the proud position which it now held; and he must be permitted to say that it was a great source of satisfaction to himself that at that time 21 years since, when he had the honour of filling the office of Lord Mayor, he had presided at the first anniversary of this excellent institution. It was again a source of gratification to him to meet his friends that day, assembled a^- they were to promote the interests of a hospital the object of which was to alleviate sufferings of the most aggravated description. Such an institution had, indeed, claims upon the sympathy of the public. But, really, when he beheld such a meeting as this, attended as it was by gentlemen of the highest character in the city of London, he felt that no words which could fall from him could adequately express his opinion of its merits. He would now call upon the secretary to read the notice convening the meeting.
Thls having been done, the Secretary, Mr. Whiskin, proceeded to re the following report:-
" Another year ham closed upon the labours of your Comoittee.

(Applause. ) He most cordaally tgreed in au that rad faUen from their worthy chairtman in the desire to hand down torosterity the like. ness of that great man whose zeal, skill, and Chriz-tian. like feeling had equally contributed to the alleviation of so much susueesng. (bptplause.) In whatever way the governors and others might mantfest their regard for that esdtmable wan, he was quite sure that iohen he retired from theinstitution he would have the hrppiness of kno,u inb he had fotnded and completed one of the dost noble hospntals that was ever ransed for the alleblation of h rman suffering.

Then whoso names and charaohtrs wereathe best guarantee for the fulfilment of his views, ato he hon. baronet concluded by troving a vote of thanks to th 2 the hof anagement, and the re-election of G. Glas Sandeman, Esq. (chairman), John Grifsch urith, Esq. (deputy-chairman), Staoey Ghnmaldv, and Benjamin Lawrence Sowelf, Esqsf , whho rep sore may gentlemen of herigh sandingo elcion th ommeIrDol-
lend, in the room of Mr. Shepperson, deceased, to whore memory he ilaid a well-merited eulogium.
lr. Tilson having seconded the motion, it was carried with acclamation.
Mr. Sandeman returned thanks in very grateful terms, andconcluded by moving, " That the thanks of the mueeting be tendered to John Masterman, Esq., MP., the treasurer of the institution," and the motion, having been seconded, wwa carried unanimously.
Mr. Mfsterman returned thanks, and expressed his wish that he might have a great deal more trouble given him as treasurer. (Applause.)
MAr. J. G. Frith, in highly complimentary terms, proposed a vote to Dr. Spurgin, the honorary physician, and
r. Fredenok Salmon, the honorary surgeon and founder. Dr. Oak seconded the motion.
Dr. Spurgin, in returning thanks, alluded to the courtesy which le had always received from the committee of management-a fact wlich only rendered him the more anxious to exert his energies in the promotion of the interests of the hospital. When Mr. Salmon asked him to co-operate with him he conddered ita high honour, and ho felt that more strongly when he saw assembled around him so many gentlemen who had come there in what miet be termed the centre or the most valuable part of the ay to give their aid in support of this noble institution. This w!as indeed the best pledge that they desired to perpetuate its blessings. If he dentured to return thanks for Mr. Salmon he found himself incompetent to the task- but In being associated with that amiable and gilted gentl'eman he
could not but feel that in his own person he was specially honoured.
hÃ¯Â¿Â½r. Sandeman moved the thanks of the meeting to their worthy chairman, who on all occasions had rendered good service to the institution; and the motion having been seconded by llr. Frith,
Mr. George Holgate Foster briefly suggested the necessity of forming a permanent fund to endow the hospital, aud thus Drotect it against any reverse of foitune. He was glad to hear the charity was out of debt, yet, feeling a deep interest in its sucoess, he desired to see it safe. He felt the greatest pleasure in requesting that his name should be put down for 2001 as a commencement of such fund, and hoped that othor contributions would be made for the same obj ct. (Loud applause.)
The Chairman returned thanks, and stated that Mr. Foster's example bad already been folowed by Mr. Glas Sandeman giving 100 guineas, and 31r. Frith 100l., towards the formation of a permanent fund, in the necessity of which he quite concurred. As it had pleased God to allow him to witness the 21st anniversary of this hospital, he hoped Mr. Salmon would allow him to put his name down as steward for the approaching anniversary. (Cheers.) He begged to move the best thanks of the meeting to Mr. Foster for his great liberality and kindness.
The motion having been seconded, Mr. Foster expressed his hope that his proposition would meet with cordial suppert.
Mr. R. A. Gray moved that the report, which he warmly eulogized, be printed and circulated.
Mr. Tilson, as one of the auditors, begged to say he had never seen accounts more correctly or better kept than they were by the secretary. (Hear, hear). He had great pleasure in contributing 501. to the permanent fund. (Applause).
The Chairman moved that it be an instruction to the committee of management to give effect to the recommendation in the report as to the selection of a portrait or bust of Mr. Salmon.
Carried -with acclamation.
Mr. Salmon then requested the chairman to kindly preside at the approaching festival of the hospital, which the worthy alderman willingly consented to do. In reference to the creation of a permanent fund, Mr. Salmon remarked it had happened that only six weeks ago a friend had broached the idea to him, and had offered to contribute 1001. That gentleman was Mr. Levick.
The sum raised for the permanent fund amounted to

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Feb. 20.
COUBT OP BANKRU1PrCy, Bag7ngaZastrea, Feb. 20. IN RE C. VAV TAT
(Before Mr. aomminr HoLuoD.A
Whe bankruPt was a woollen warehouseman of Breadstreet, Cheapeade. He has also bad two other esthblishmeuts, one of which was at Manchester.
This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Appleton opposed, and 3Mr. Lawrance supported.
Itwas urgedagainst the bankrupt that, after having consulted his soHcitor, he had on the same day that he signed a declaration of insolvency parted with a bill of exchange for 600h and sundry bills of lading. For the bankrupt it was urged that MIr. Sichel had obtained the biU of exchange by force, having seized him by the throat, and, with poker in hand, demanded it, and that the bills of lading
had been obtained from him by means of showing a power of attorney.
His HONOUR1 held that the case was not within the 201st section, which directed the refusal of the certificate where a trader " parted with any books, papers, writings) or secuzrities," the parting with the bill of excbange not having been voluntary, but under pressure. Althougb, however, the bankrupt's conduct did not come expressly 'within that clause and the 206th section, yet parting with property on the very day of signing the declaration of insolvency was a Eenous offence against the bankruptcy laws. He should not have allowed property to be taken from him, but have called in the aid of the law. His own statement to this effect could not be received as evidence in his own favour, and he must be held to have intended the necessary consequences of his own acts. His unsecured debts were 6,0001., and the assets hadrealized 8001, a sum of 1,000h bea n ken credit for on the sale of stock which cost 1,500.
Lie pt's trade expenses had been 3,500L, the profits being 2,8004., and the personal and domestic expenses, although at the moderate rate of 2501. per year under other circumstances, were not warranted when the bankrupt was in insolvent circumstances and the trade was a losing one. It nust not be supposed that a trader could be allowed to permit the disposal of property on the day of signing the declaration of insolvency, and perhaps after having actually signed such declaration, a might have been done in this case, and, having regard to all the circumstances, the certificate (second class) must be suspended two years The creditors objecting, protection 'would be'withheld fonr months.
LN RIC L. BENJA211r.
The bankrupt was a fish-merchant in Jevwry-street nd Love-lane, Billingsgate. His accounts show debts 6,0004, and a few hundred pounds of assets. His application to pass his examination was opposed by Mr. Lucas and supported by Mr. L'wrance.

He (Meyer) knew nothing about purchasing fish, but had managed his (bankrupt's) leather business, to which be had been brought up. The amount paid for interest and discount had exceeded 1,0001., although he procured discounts from the first banking establishments at the low rate of 41 and 5 per cent.

Insolvent Debtors' Court, Feb. 20.
INSOLVENT DRBTOzI COUR1, Feb. 20. IN RE THE ITON. EDWIN 3 rRTKLv I'AMA v-
(Before the Cmzr ComtImowER.
This insolvent, son of Lord Portman, who6e case was mentioned on his application for bail, appeared to be heard.
Mir. REm opposed on the part of Mr. Thomas Elliott Price, auctioneer, of Chancery-lane, and also for a Mr. William Price.
Mlr. SARoon supported the application for discharge.
On his examination the insolvent stated that he was the second son of Lord Portman. He was 26, and was a member of the bar, havmg been caUed in 1852, he had practised. Since 1852 his income had varied, averaging about 4001. a-year. He had an allowance of 3001. s-year from his father, and 1001. a-year as fellow of AU Souls College, Oxford. The alowance from his father was voluntary, and was now discontinued. His debts were 2,029O, incurred since May, 1854 The debts were principay for money borrowed, and the greater part of the money had gone to pay racing debts. He borrowed the money last year. In June he received 1,200. of Mr. Thomas Elliott Price. He borrowed the money to meet losses incurred by betting. At the time he contracted that debt he owed 9001. or 1,0001. He subsequently received 2001. of the other Mr. Price, to renew the promissory note of Mr. Thomas Bliott Price. When he =orrowed the money he had expectations that he might have won the money, or that his father would have paid his debts. He had not applied at that time to his father or to any member of his family. After the money was due he applied to his father, who refused to assist him. The application was made to his father subsequently to the renei,-l_ At the second time of the renewal he was oblged to pay the interest, as his father had held out some aight hopes that somdething might be done. His father ha held out that some arrangement might be made. He did not say who was to make it, but the supposition was that he would make it. He borrowed 1001. of the other Mr. Price at one time and 1001. at another time. It was after the other biUs had become due. He bad expectations of paving the money. He did not know that his father wopld assist him, as his Lordship required to know the value of the debts, and would then see what could be done. He informed his father of their character and nature, and he said he would not pay them. It was after Mr. Price served him with avwrit. He believed that he had no*no interest under his father's or mother's settlement. He never statedthathehad aninterestinl5,0001., but that hehad an interest tothat amount. He knewa Mr. Rishworth and his son, and stated to them that he once had an interest in 15,0001. He knew there had been an alteration made, but he did not know what wasthe alteration made. It occurred in the course of conversation with Rishworth, whom he had employed to get the money from Price. The interest was in 15,cOO. forhim, as one of the younger children, over which his father had a power of appointment. He did not know when the alteration was made, but he believed it took place in 1852 or 1853. His father's solicitor, Mr. Wild, had told him of the alteration.
Mr. SARGooD said his Lordship had ordered his solicitor to give every explanation. There was now no absolute interest. HisLordship had the power of appointment for his younger children. H Iordeliopexercised his power in savour of the insolvent to 15,00I., and afterwards revoked it.
The insolvent further stated that in 1854 or 1855 1r. Wild told him of the alteration. He did not try to raise money from an insurance-office. It was suggested in 1856 that he could raise some money. Mr. Rishworth suggested that itcouxld be done. He had jumpea to that conclusion. Mar. Ristcworth proposed that he should make a declaratio
and he offered to do it as far as he knew about it. He did not know what alteration had been made. In 1855 he lost 1,521. on betting. He had previously lost a large sum, 1,0001. or 1,5001., which was some years ago. His father had assisted him in paying the debts. He had held the situation of n~vate secrtary to the First Commissioner of thelloard of Works. He did nothold the appointmentnow; he left it the first week in December, just before his arrest by Mr. Thomas Elliott Price.
Mr. Rishworth was called as a witness, but did not Esnswer, and Mr. Reed had no other witness to call.
Mr. Lewis (Lwis and Lewis), attorney for the insolvent, produced the deeds in reference to theappointuent and the revocation. Mr. Wild was at present not in court.
The CHtE COMUSMN3R suggested that some statement should app ear on the schedule of the power of appointment and the revocation.
Mr. Lewis read a statement which had been made on paper, setting forth thatin February, 1851, an appointment was made in favour, of the insolvent for 15,0001., and in December of the sane year revoked. Lord Portman had paid nearly 10,0001. for the insolvent, and in case he should again get into the hands of money-lenders, trustees were appointed in the event of insolvency.
In answer to further questions by Mr. REED,the insolvent said his check-book was at his father's house. He did not know it was necessary to file it.
The CHMP CohroNEM did not suppose that it would have been very edifying, and the betting-book, he supposed, would be the same.
Mr. REED said the books should have bean filed.
It appeared that the insolvent had debts since Mr. Price's. He had obtained money and had speculated on the turf. He had not been successful to py his creditors.
Mr. RuXE submitted that the insolvent had incurred the debts with the creditors for whom he appeared (who were not related) without reasonable or probable expections of payment. lt could not be said that the expectation from D father, who had already pafid 10OOOor m or his expectation from the turf were such 'as would justify the intolventin getting 1,200l from Mr. Thoma Eubtt a rice, or 201 rm Mr. WilliaiR Price. No doubt a good deal would be said of the interest charged by Mr. Thomas E. Price, and that 681. had been charged on each renewal. But it should be borne in mind that the interest paid had been paid out of the principal. The learned counsel remarked that it was not a " creditble" insolvency, and that no evidenor had oeen given on the other diden
ere SAdGOOD, in reply, oain he aid not understand in wbat sense any insolvency could be called "creditable," but probably Lord Portman thought, in reference to that
question, that it was lews creditable to the opponents o have lent the money than that his son sbould make this application to the Court because his father refused to pay it, and, as regarded the absence of evidence, all that the insolvent could say had been obtained by his learned friend's examination of him while the facts, which be might have obtained from the creditors by theircross-examination, had been kept from the Inowledge of the Court, solely from their not choosing to go into the witness-box. He submitted that there could be no pretence for the complaint that the debt had bcen contracted in the manner alleged.
The CmEv Co3mL%ioNm-The case was as simplI
as any that ever. came before him. The insolvent had only one creditor-that was, only one creditor whose debt it was necessary to inquire into. With the previous career of the insolvent, and his gambling and sporting debts, the Court had nothing to do, because there were no debts in the schedule incurred before last spring. The schedule contained the names of three or four tradesmen, but they did not complain, and the largest of them had become surety for the insolvent's discharge on bail. There were a few debts for money lost, which had been inserted becaus acknowledgments of them had been iven. The only creditors who complained were one Mr. rvice, who had lent money, and another Price, who had ad. vanced more as a premium to defer payment of the first for a month. Neither of these persons had appeared in court, although one resided in Chancery-lane and the other in the Baymarket, but had contented themselves with the arrest of the insolvent and a speech from their counseL 'Ho
could it be said that Mr. Price had been il-used in the advance of his 1,2001., when he was, no doubt, as ready to lend as the other was to borrow? The young man was known to belong to a noble and wealthy family, and it was expected that tne money would be repaid some day. He (the Chief Commissioner) had never known a man less injured than Mr. Price had been. The insolvent would be declared entitled to his discharge
The amendments req3ired having been made, tho insolvent was declared entitled to the benefit of the Act, and ordered to be dischrged forthwith.

POLIcB.
Wonsmp-Smr.E-John King, 21, shoemaker,wa charged with a brutral asault.
Sarah Petley, a Tery tidy and good-looking young woman, statedthatshehadbeen livingwith theprisonerfor sometime past as his wife, andthat, though he had repeatedly beaten ner very shamefully, Bhe had up to this always refrained from unishing hin. On Thursday he came home partly intox.ated, nd accompanied by two of his companions named Curry and Rose, and without uy provocation on her part flung atubfullof water over her. ile then*went to bed, to sleep his drunkenness off, and she was preparing tea when the pnsoner suddenly came down, struck her a violent blow on the head with his fist, then seized the fire-tongs, and struck her sucha blowwith them upon the shoulder" that the tongs were broken, but the blow did not hurt her so
much." She was much terrified, and ran out into an em pty! house to conceal herself, but he pursued her, flung her down, tore her hair out, swore he would strangle her, and tried to do so, and, had not Rose interposed and pulled him away, she would have been stiU more seriously injured. " The goods were mine," said thewitness, "but now all my things are broken; I have not a chair to sit on or anything to uae, all my glass and crockery are are smashed, snd my dresses torn to pieces; in fact, he was 3ust like a madman. Last Monday he beat me again, and has sworn that he wil make me the inmate of a hospital or else be hung for me."
Rose deposed to saving the woman, and that the attack was wholly unprovoked.
The prisoner said he was fightfully drunk, and was never in such a passion in his life.
Mr. HAmuL, said it was a very scandalous assault, and sentenced him to three months' hard labour in the House of Correction, and to find bail for his peaceable behaviour for three months in addition.
The maate noticed his receipt of the first half of a 51. note, No. 81,298, from " Peter Fickwick," and a 101. check from Mr.Joseph Locke, )L ., for the poor-box, and 10s. from " IL N., for a little girl named Eliza Breckman, whose uncle, a haberdasher, named Walker, is now under remand at this court for Musing her.
CLERExmNwxnL-Our reporter is requested to acknow ledge the receipt of 51. for thopoor-box from " A. C. B."
Tu~rss.-Mdr. SEL has received a donation of 10s. for Edward Haley, of No. 10, Chancery-place, Shadwrell, wrho wras represented to be in deep distress a fewr dais since, and the donor requested it might be acknowledged in T7c Times as coming from " Luke, c. 10, v. 36 and 3r.,"
SouTHwAm.-Hippolyte Boulanger, a hatter of Castlestreet, and Patri* Carroll, a labourer, were charged with receiving a large quantity of French hat plush. stolen from thepremises of MIr. Gallibert, wholesale dealer and importer of rench goods, 30,Union-street, Borough, bytheirporter, a man named Hearn, who on being discovered as the thief cut his throat in a frightful manner, and now lies iif the hospital iu a dangerous state. The prosecutor stated that having missed a large quantity of plush while Hearn was in his employ, about ten days ago he taxed him with the robbory. e snade some statement acknowledging his guilt and impcating the prisoners as receivers of the stolen property, and shortly afterwards he cut his throat in such a frightful manner that he was compelled to send him to the hospital, where he now remains. Wltness afterwards gave such information to the polce as led to the apprehension of the prisoner and the discovery of a large quantity of his pro-
Edwin West, 136 If, said that on the previous evening he accompanied the prosecutor to Carroll's house, Providenceplace,Red Cross-street, and took him into custody. He told him he was charged with stealing or receiving a large quantity of hatjplush, the profer'b of Mr. Gallbert. Re at first denied al knowledge of it, but afterwards he said that he should make his statement at another place. Witness had heard from Ream that he disposed of some of the property to the prisoner.
Edwin Colem-n, 53 31, said he went to Mr. Boulanger's who carries on a small business as a hatter in Castle-street. He saw him there, and asked him if he had purchased any plush from a man named Hearn. He replied that he had not, when witness examined his stock and found a large quantity, which fr. Gallibert identified, and he took him into custody. He had seen Hearn, the prosecutor's porter, in tha hospital, and he acknowledged stealing the property and disposing of it to the prisoner. The prosecutor had promito forgive him if he told the truth. Under these eircumstances he made the statement implicating the prisoners. Witness believed that he wouldhe sufficiently recovered from his wound to be able to attend this court in a week.
The Magistrate aecordingly remanded them for a week, and consented to accept baiL.
L&vBTH.-RusseR Pearce, a young man of respectable appearance, who has been a confidential clerk in the employment of Ir. Cooke, an auctioneer in the Westminsterroad, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NORTON on o charge of embezzling various sums of money the property of his employer, nd appropriating them to his own
Mr. Cooke, the prosecutor, said he was not only pained but surpsedatthe position in which the prisoner had placed himself, as he had been in his service when he had been obliged to proceed against another young man in his employ, who had robbed him of 1501., and since then had gone over the books with him for the purpose of detectinz
another person whohad aso attempted to rob him, and it therefore pained him (Mr. Cooke) to find that the prisoner had so committed himself.
MEr. NORTON observed that it was perfectly lamentable to find the growing evil of dishonesty among servants. From the most confidenthal to the most humble all seemed to be going on wrong.
Mr. Cooke said the friends of the prisoner were most respectable persons, and for thoir sakes, and not for his, he should be willing, with his Worship's sanction, to forego a prosecution, provided he should be protected from an action for false imprisonment.
Mr. NorTON replied that an action under the circumstances was quite out of the question, and a solicitor who attended on the prisoner's behalf said he should pledge his word that no action should be brought.
Mr. NORTON thought that a short imprisonment would do the prisoner no harm, and he ahould remand him for a week, to give time to the prosecutor to ascertain the extent of his defalcations.
The prisoner was remanded accordingly.

This was an appa by the bankrupt, Mr. WilUiam Tyson, a flour dealer atrLverpool, against a judgment of Mr. Corn.- missioner Perry, of the Disrict Court of Bankruptcy at that place, by which that learned gentleman had granted the bankrupt a certificate of the second class, but suspended it for two years from theo 23d of January last, IIwithout protection for the present." The gonds of the judgment
appeared to bo thatlh akrp a borrowedl money of, among others, a Mr. Pemberton for abort perods ad a large rate of interest. The judgment upon this point contained the following paseage-
" He has paid to aIr. Pemberton in interest en Ioans Ã¯Â¿Â½4 022 a sum exceedig o the whol ofia profLe, which arestatedeatpi 3,n . ein. teret sopd van at narous rates-seneray at Ã¯Â¿Â½ per cent, per peaoth, nut there Lre instances of chro made of ka for the o o an of Ã¯Â¿Â½106 for 12 dats which las fter the rasof about Ã¯Â¿Â½150 per cet. per annuso; and a charge n one mased of 2forthe loan or 100 for four dats which ia after the rate of bok percenb t per annum.- The other grtond was for bad bookkeeping.
Mr. SELwYN and tk r. Do Gth . who appeared for the hppealn explained that the mode of keeping the books arose from the fact that the bankrut was origially a farmer, and was an uneducated and terate manw; that he had skilu in dealing in flour, and began busness 22 years ago with one shop, whic gradually increased until he owned filve tbo n; thLt at firt he kept no book but a mnemorandum.

clerks to keep, but they did not do so, continuing the old., mode of keeping the accounts; and tha t the reason for borrowing the money at such rates of interest was that the
bankpupt having opportunities for making goo hargain it.. was worN his while to pay the amount, and even then he,,
told At & profit.
Lord JUStice KNIGHT BRucE sad, it was quite impossible to sanction a trade,min raising money at such a rate of interest, but as tho case did not seem to present any feoture of dshnety other than so far as borrowing money upon
eh terms might be deemed dishonest, hehshoul thn that. justice would be satisfied by leaving the judgment as it is,
ave only giving the bankrupt rotection,, without whichh. could not maintain himself or family.
Mr. BACON and Mr. GRiTryn insisted that the judgmnent of the commissioner, instesAd of being too severe, was too lenient, for the bookkeeping appeared to be fraudulent, for no nty aperedasto hemonysborrowed from Mr.
Pemertn, he ankupts slictor ghowever, the Court.
tO its decision.
Lord Justice KNIxHT BRUCz said, that the assignees had done no more than their duty. This Court, however, must. not allow itself to be reasonably suspected of favouring such conduct; how far unreasonably asupected It need not and did not care.
Mr. BACON and Mr. GRExvTH further addressed the Court, principally on the construction of the penal section (256th) of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act.
Lord Justice IKNIGT BRucE.-I do not consider us, myself, differing from Mr. Commissioner Perry when I say that itwilibe a sufficient mark of our disapproval of the bankrupt's conduct by leaving the suspension and class of the certificate for the time and nature decided by him, but granting the bankrupt protection, and, the assignees consenting, lf they wil consent, let the bankrupt take the deposit back.
Lord Justice Tu.1t35 was not satisfied with the conduct . of the bankrupt in the matter of the borrowing of money; neither was he satisfied that the non-entry of those tranctionsin the books was a fraudulent omission, for the bankrupt did not seem to consider thatthose transactions formed part of the business concerns of his trade, and he thought that justice would be satisfied by the order which his learned brother had proposed.
Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUcE.-I take leave to sa that no case of fraud has by this Court been treated with anything but severity-none.
The bankrupt was allowed to receive back his deposit, and the assignees were ordered to take their costs out of the estate.

This was a petition for the payment out of court of a sum of 161M, representing a legacy of 100. with interest, which had been paid into court by the executor of a trustee under the Trustee Relief Act, and the only question was as to the costs. The circumstances were these :-The legacy in ques. tion belonged to Mr Jones, who, with her husband, was in Austr , but their solicitor had full power under a power of attorney to act for them in all matters. The trus
teo was also residuary legatee, and it wa. said, on behalf of the petitioners, that the true reason why the money was paid into court was in consequence of disputes as to other matters, and the Costs ought to come Out of the residue, whereas the executor contendec that, as Mr. Jones claimed the legacy in right of his wife, the power of attorney was not a sudicient authority to him to pay the money to the solicitorunder the circumstances. It wis also urgedfor the petitioners that the executor had no right to appear, inasmuch as he was requested not to do so, the sum beimg so small, and had, notwithstanding, chosen to incur this expense. To this it was said that a party who was served had a right to appear. Affidavits and a large mass of correspondence were read to show the above faots.
Mr. Speed appoared upon the petition; Mr. Dickinuon Opposed it.
The VICirC?ACzjLoR thought that it was to be re-- gretted such an expense had been incurred in going mto these matters, so much more than the costs in question. W-ith regard to the costs of payment into court, his Honour thought that the executor was not entitled to the costs, inasmuch as he had received the whole residue, and the legatee had a right to have those costs paid out of the resdue. With regard to the costs of appearanco, he was entitled to those coets, because, notwithstanding he was requested not to appear, the Court desired that trustees in such cases shoul appear. It was not necessary, therefore, to enter into the question of risk, although his Honour thought there was a slight one which certainly mighthave been met by a guarantee, but tne Court never required a trustee to accept such guarantee, and it was only in the case of a mere wanton payment into court that the party was visited with the payment of costs. It appeared to his Honour that there wasa sufident justilication for paying the money into court, but the costs must not be paid out of the legacy, and the trustee was entitled to his costs of appearance.

Mr. Bnwnw JA^xSs, Q.C., who (with Mr. Milward appeared for the defendants, rose and said, the plaintiff did not appear, and he had instructed no one in lis behalf. The action was brought bz the person who was the plaintifin the action recently tried at Westminster against the Marquis of Bath, and the present action, brought against Mr. Knightley, the member for Northamptonshire, was of a siilar nature. The learned counsel wished a verdict to be taken for the defendant.
Lord CAMrsxLL said the plaintiff must be nonsuitod. Hlis Lordship expressed his satisfaction that the case had not been proceeded with; and said that he was not certain that, if it had been gone on with, the parties would not be lable to be indicted for subornation of perjury.
Mr. JAXES said a great number of actions had been brought by this man, but, under his (Mr. James's) advice,. prDceedings were being taken to cheek them.
The plaintiff was then nonsuited.
SPRYE V. PORTER.
Mir F. Thesiger, Mr. Lush, and Mr. Lofee apered for the plaintiff; and Mr. X. Chambers, QC.Q. bfr. SI Q.C.,. and Mx. Mfaward for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Richard Sprye, was a personskUlled in tracing pedigrees, and he sued the defendant,. Thomas Porter, to recover a sum of upwards of 10,0001.,. under an agrement by which the defendaant promised that. if the plaintiff would furnish the defendant with cestain. documents and evidence then in the plaintiff's hands, ancd the defendant should succeed hyitheir means in establishing his ri&ht to certain prog,rty, the defendant would pa.y the plaintiff one-fifth of ta PPerty so acaonired. The de. fendnt leadd agrea many pleas, one of which allege
that the agreemnent had been rescinded, and the other 'thad
thef theht of aotio. Thscnite Ifmnmntlisrp therightsof parocti rif any, was vested in the assgrnees of the plaintiff, who hadl bieen insolvent.
Sir F. THESG'En, in opening the case to the jury, entered into a fuillbistory of the origini of the plaintiff's cimni and, from the learned cOunsel'sistatement, it seemed that plain. tiff considered that he had been most unjustly treated. The defendant, through the plaintiff's exertions, had succeeded to a large property, of which he had previouslyn nto whbatever, and which he never could hiave receied but forio the exertions of the plaintiff, and yet the plaintiff was now forced into a court of law to enforce his rights. It would aippear, however, that the defendant himself was net opiPosd to the claim,- made by the plintiff, buLt the fund byn been taken possesson of by the defendant's attoarney it was he alone who was now resistiag the plain. tiff's demand. The facts of the Icase were these :-In the year 1847 the Rev. W. Townley, the vcr of Orp~in ton, ini Kent, died childless and intes'tate. TheCrown M$ possesson of his property, amounting to 52,0001., andl ad.vertised for his next of kin. The plaintiff was addicted to the study of genealogies, and he determined, no doubt with a view to his own advantage, to endeavour to discover the extof in o Mr Tonley an bya great expenclitore
kinofth itetae.Ths onisedofmonumenta inscri-ip tios, arohil rgisers &., btane by the greatest
industry, bytorrempondence, and by advertisements, whereby the plaintiff ;ves enabled to trace out the various lines of the
Townleys. The learned counsel went through a minute! statement ot these investigations, whlich eventually intro- i duced the plaintiff to the defendant, Thomas Porter, a coal Bmerchant at Manchester, who was ultimately proved to be
tlhe son of the half sister, and consequently the nephew of I the intestate. The defendant himself was quite unconscious ef hiis relationship, and at first doubted and disbelieved it -
but his right was ultimately establshed by a trial which I took place in this court. The defendant, on his being made I .cquainted wvith his rights, referred the plaintiff to MIr. Alderman Walker, and after several interviews the agreement on which the present action was founded was draws up by the defendant's solicitor, a Mr. Robinson. It was executed on the 4th of December, 1852, by the plaintiff and a person nrsmed Rosar, who had been associated with him, and by thedefendant. On the 14th of December, 1852, the defendant Porter sent in his claim as next of kin. 'The plaintiff was then requested to draw up a statement of the whole case, in the form of a brief for counsel, which he accordingly did on 72 brief sheets; and it was upon the statement of the case so drawn up that Robinson, the defendant's solicitor, had acted throughout. The learned counsel proceeded to detail the circumstances under which the defendant's solicitor, Robinson, caused the plaintiff to be arrested and thrown into prison for debt, at Manchester, and stated that the plaintiff had been induced to omit his claim under the agreement from his schedule, on an assurance given by Robinson that Porter was about to cancel the agreement, and that if the plaintiff adopted his (Robinson's) recommendation, as soon as the plaintiff had passed the Insolvent Oort ho should have another and an equally benefical agreement. The plaintiff agreed to this arrangeIent, but Robinson persisted in keeping the papers, and had Aone so ever since. On the 16th of December, 1853, Robiason, on the part of the defendant, served on the plaintiff while in Prisen a notice to the effect that the defendDat did not intend, at his own expense, any further to prosecute his claim either at law or in equity, and that the agreement of 'the 4th of December, 1852, wasat an end. According to the agreement, if the agreement was cancelled the papers were to be given up, but they were never returned -instead of that being done, the proceedings went on bsfore the Vice-Chancellor. The agreement being omitted from the plaintiff's schedule, under these circumstances he 'was, on the 18th of January, 1854, discharged. In the month of February, 1854, Robinson promised the defendant to execute a deed, under which, in consideration of the sum of 501. advanced by Robinson to the defendant, the latter transferred to Robinson aU his property, subject, however, to any claim which might exist against the defendant. Robinson had thus managed to get the complete control of any 'fund that might be recovered. The learned counsel stated that at one period the rights of the defendant had been put ineril by the production of an award dated in the year 1798, which purported to show the identity of a John Townley, of Manchester, with a John Townley, of London. That award, however, was proved to have been a forger;.
Lord CrAMPBELL said, this was not a case for an arbitration, but it must be decided by a jury, unless some final arrangement could be made between the parties.
Sir F. THESIGER said, he should be very glad if that could .be done.
Mlr. M, CHAsrBaaS said, he thought it was very desirable.
lord OAMPBELL said, it would be for 'the advantage of all parties that the matter should be settled without further litigation.
The counsel on both sides then retired from court, and vere absent a considerable time. At length they returned, and
Sir F. THESIGER said, it bad been agreed that the plaintiff should have a verdict on the issues in fact, except as to the 6th and 11th pleas which were to be found for the defendant, the damages being assessed at 10,0004.
Lord CAMPBELL said that if the dispute had gone on spon the issues in law and fact the whole of the money would have been spent in litigation. His Lordship thought the parties were exceedingly indebted to their counsel for the kind advice they had given to them.
Sir F. TlsrsIGEB Said, they were mnuch indebted to his Lordship for his advice.
.Mr. M. CiLUiBEnS samid, his client was' anxious to have the fund properly disposed of, as there were other parties concernedp

CAYTOR Y. THE LOND AND NORTH IVESTERN RALWVAY
COMPAINY.
Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Prowett appeared for the plaintiff e and Mr. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. Robinson for the defen ants.
The plaintiff in this action, Moss Cantor, sued the London and North-Western Railway Company to recover damages for their neglect to deliver a parcel which had been booked at the Euston station to be carried to Birmingham. The defendants pleaded several pleas denying their liability.
It appeared that the plaintiff was what is caUed a "theatrical costumer," who was in the habit of letting out ,on hire complete sets of dresses requisite for the performance of the various operas and other dramatic entertainmients. When performers were "going the circuit," itwas the practice for the manager of the company to write up to lonuon to a theatrical costumer, and for him to send down into the provinces the various dresses required for the forthcoming entertainments. A Mr. Coombs had entered into an agreement with a Mr. Galon, the manager of the Birmingham Theatre, to supply him with the necessary costumes for one year, for wihch he was to receive a weeklv ay mnent of 21. Coombs was not able to complete one of these orders received in December last, and he indaced the plain'tiff to assist him. The plaintiff accordingly on Saturday, the 6th of December, made up a bundle of things, and his 'wfe sewed on the bundle a card containing the following direction:-" For Mr. Galon, Theatre Royal, Birmingham.1' The word. "immediate" was written in the corner of the paper. Mrs. Cantor and her brother, George Newton, then took the bundle in a cab to the Euston-square station. mrs. Cantor, it was stated, was at the present tinie too il to attend as a witness, but, according to the evidence of Newton, as soon as the parties arrived at the station a porter opened the door and said, " Where to 7 " The 'witness replied that he wanted to book the bundle for Birmmngham. Upon this the porter took up the bundle, and carried it to a room full of luggage, and placed the bag on the counter. The man behnd the counter said, "Where to?" to which the witniess replied that he wanted it to go to Birmingham. The 'porter then turned round and said, "Twopence," which
. Cantor paid. The witness added that when the bundle 'was put on the counter he (the witness) said "IMr. Cantor sends." A ticket was then filled up and torn from a book -and handed to the witness, which he gave to Mrs. Cantor. The witness said lie then asked the man if the bundle would be delivered in Birmingham by Monday evening, and that the man replied, "Oh, long before." The 6th of December was a Saturday, and the things were to be at Birmtnghamn for use on the following Monday night. The parcel was not forwarded. The plaintiff sent a young woman -to the office a few days before Christmas to make inquiry for a parcel sent to Mr. Galon, but which had not come to hand. The clerk told her it would be all right, he would mnake inquiries, and requested her to call again; but she omitted to do this, having in the meantime been confined. A claim was then on the 15th of December made upon the company in respect of the lost parcel; but, as the company took no notice of the letter, this action was commenced on the 23d of December. Subsequently a minutc search was made by the company and the parcel was found in the Left l,ggage-office, and it was returned to the plaintiff on the 13th of the present month. It turned out. that it had in fact been booked in the "Left Luggage-office," and the question now was whether the parcel had been delivered for -the purpose of being carried to Birmingham, as stated by the witness Newton, or whether it had not been booked in the "Left Luggage-office," to remain there. The ticket was read, and was an ordinary left-luggage ticket, and contained this notice at the bottom :-" N.B. No packages will be delivered up withont the production of this ticket." It, however, contained a heading printed in large letters,
- Luggage and Cloak-room," but the words 'and cloak" had been obliterated by the company, so that, as the plaintiff contended, there was good remson for the parties to believe that they had properly delivered the parcel at the "luggage-office."
The defence was, that the story told by Newton as to the conversation with the porter and the clerk was entirely false. The porter from the left luggage-office was called, and stated that he remembered the parcel being brought by a woman, who said she wished to leave the parcel, and on being asked when she was going to Birmingham, she said she was going down on the Sunday or Monday morning. This witness - said he saw no one with the woman, and he -denied having had any conversati,,n with Newton or any other beyond what he had before spoken to.
Lord CA.MPBELL, in summing up the evidence, said, the -question for the jury would be whether the parcel was deaivered to the company for the purpose of being sent to 3lirminghani, or whether it was to be left in the left luggage.office till cilled for. That would depend on whether the jury would believe the witness Nlewton, or Baker, the com.pany's servant, by whom he was directly contradicted. It was much to be regretted that Mrs. Cantor was not here, as her evidence upon that point would have been very impor-tant. His Lordship expressed his opinion rather in favour of the defendants' witness, but said it was 'a question .entirely for the jury, and they must form their own -opinion.
The jury in a fewv minutes found a verdict for the de-fendanta.
Mr.;''runsosryapplied that the ticket which bah 'een taken possession of by the defendants' solicitor should Ise delivered up to the plaintiff.
Mfr. IDiLLQR said, the defendants were entitled to have -the ticket, as they hadl sent back the parcel to the plaintiff.

.RAlTWAY INTBLLIGENCE. LONDON AND NORTr-WrT1RN
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Euston station, the Marquis of Chandos in the chair.
Mr. C. E. STEWART, the secretary, read the minutes of the last meeting, which were confirmed .
The report and statement of sccounts, abstracts of which have appeared in Tile 2m'es, were taken as read.
The CHAIRMA?T said the course which had been adopted of sending out with the report a statement of the accounts to the proprietors rendered it unnecessary that he should enter into any lengthened statement of details. The report contained the results of the working of the railway during the last half-year, the views of the directors with regard to the works still required to be done, particularly in reference to the additional lines already authorized, and a statement of the measures which had been introduced into Parliament during the present session, which were likely to affect the interests of the company. An alteration had been made in the form of what was caUed the renewal of road account, showing, in accordance with what was understood to be the wish of the proprietors, the amount of the balance stated to be outstanding on that account, but which was not strictly for a renewal of the road, but for additional materials introduced into the permaLnent way. The certificate of the auditors demonstrated the actual improvementi made on the road, and which fuHy justified this charge to capitaL The Board had come to the resolution of asking the proprietors for a considerable amount of capital to be spent on improvement of the lines already existing and in work, in order to produce greater economy in carrying on their traffic. They proposed to ask for 350,0001. for completing the proposed third line fromn Bletchley to Wilesden. The directors were induced to do that, not forthe sake of obtaining a large additional traffic, but for the sake of working with economy the trafric they at present had, although, doubtless, the posseesion of that line would give them an unlimited amount of traffic. The reasons the directors thought the formation of that line would introduce economy in the workings were these - This line was one of the public highways for the traffic from Scotland and the North of England to London. It was the line on which almost the whole of the chief postal accorasmodation of the country was carried on. The large developemnent which had taked p lace in railvays through. out the courtry had rendered ppuctuality, Certainty, speed, and safety the only real secuarities which the company could hope to havefor the retention of their traffic in masyimportant points In the early days of railways that trafEic could not be taken from their line, because there vere no other lines that could take it from them, but at the present moment there was hardly ny towvn in England between which nd anyother point in the country communications could not be found. Looking *t this condition of the kingdom, and at the probable extension of railways that would take place, the directors had seen that their reliance for the continuane of their trafflc depended upon the safety, punctuality, certainty, and speed with which they could deliver goods and convey passengers. The directors had also found that the delays upon their line caused by the irregularities of the trains coming from the remote parts not only of England, but of Scotland, and which tins entered upon their line, subjected the company to a small amount of additional expenditure in conducting those delayed trains to London. They found that the large additional consumption of coke amounted to a very considerable sum. These delays arose from circumsttaces which the company could never hope to control, because they were occasioned by the necessitv of bringing forward the mails delivered to them late wad by other causes beyond their reach. They conld not hope to avoid these delays by earrangement of the traffic; they wsrethereforecompelledto look forother meaosbywlhichthey ciauldlessen theerase andsthe other evils arising from these rlays. They had found from the actual traffic for the priod of a month that if the company had for someo ime post possessed a third line from Bletchley to London, which woud have enabled them to separate for that distance the passenger from the merchandise tratlic a very large saving would havebeen the result. On further inquiry it was found that the land belonging to this company, and which was purchased for the ori folrstiongof theine, would in almost every case suffice for laying don the thirdline of
rails. The relief which would he afforded by such an arrangement to the up traffic would re-act also to the advantage of the dow n line, for the delays which had arisen on the up line had materialy inter. fered with the down traffic. The directors, therefore confidently asked the shareholders to grant them the sum of money necessary to place this third line of rails, from the firm belief that it would not lead to an increased expenditure, but to an increased economy in the working of the traffic, which would almost, if not entirely, equal the interest of the money to be expended upon it, while it would give the company a security for the retention of their traffic,wby enabling them to do their work in the best manner, and with t,he greatest certainty and punctuality. and at the same time maintain on their line the greatest speed demanded for the accommodation of the public. There were some other cases in which the directors were about to ask for votes in accordance wDith resolutions which had already been frequently discussed, and which the directors found absolutely necessary for the performance of the wiork upon the line. So much for the ex;penditure for which it would be necessary to ak the sanction of the meeting. The only measure promoted by this company in the poresent session of Parhament was the introduction of a bill, in concurrence with the Shropshire Union Company, for the conversion of the Shropshire Canal into a railway. The proposal was altogether an economical arrangement, but it was a measure which required further consideration, and, if ap-
roved by the directors, it would be brought before a uture meeting, when their sanction of it would be asked. There was one subject which could not be alluded to in the report, but which had been the subject of discussion at -several meetings of the shareholders-namely, an improved communication with lreland according to the Act passed two years ago. Negotiations had been going on upon the subject, and were stm pending, no decision having yet been arrived at upon the question. The views of the Government, in the first instance, were to secure fuU speed, and the conditions proposed would have entailed an enormous risk. The question was still under negotiation, and he could not at present give the meeting any further information on the subject. IIe would now address himself to the position in which this company stood in its relation to other- companies. The differences that existed between this company and the Great Northern Company had been referred to the arbitration of Mr. Gladstone, and he beheved that that gentleman would in a few days be prepared tocometoadecision. He felt that he was expressing the sentiments of the whole body of shareholders vhen he declared how deeply they were indebted to tr. Gladstone, and would feel indebted to xny other person with his position and with his talents for being willing to give his attention and time to the solution of a question so difficult and so important to all who were interested in it. (Cheers.) Several biUs had been introduced in the House of Commons the progress of which it would be the duty of the directors to watch. Many would perhaps drop before
oing further,-some he understood had already dropped,but others would require a good deal of attention. With reference to the claims raised by the North Staffordshire Company, he was sorry to see that at a meeting of that company it was stated that their demand on this company was larger than what had been paid to them, and that they could not get any accomunts from the London and North-Western Company. The fact might be literaly true, and the net money paid to them might be smaller than they had previously received,; but the gross receipts in account were between 5,0001. and 6,0004. a-year. very numerous accounts were sent to the secretary of the North Staffordshire company a month ago, with a request that he would indicate what. ever objections were entertained against them by his Board - but up to the present no objections whatever had reached the directors of this company.
MIr. DicicrsoN suggested that more information should be given as to the line between Bletchley and Willesden. The noble chairman had talked about 350,0001. being the estimate for the formation of that line, but if the present works were meddled with It was impossible to carry out the design with such a sum.
The CHAiRnra was glad the proprietor had put the question before he (the chairman) had concluded. The widening Act obtained by the company some three or four years back imposed the necessity upon the company of having six lines of rail between Camden-town and WiUesden, a distance of six miles. Two of these lines had been let under contract, to be completed in nine months, with an additional tunnel at Ken-l-green. These works were not included in the estimate of 350,0001. It was proposed to lay a single line down on the east or up side of. the existing railway from Willesden. It was also propused to lay a single line fromn the north end of Watford tunnel to Bletchley station. Bet it was not intended to affect Watford tunnel. These works were not ineluded in the estimate of &50,0001. The details of that estimate had been gone into with great care-not upon a general view of so much per mile, but upon an actual view, and an examination of each particular bridge and work that would be affected by the new line. In the case of the two short tunnels at L4ighton and near Tring some additional land would be required, but that would be provided for at a large rate in the estimate. With reference to the stations,
several or tneem were set back at a sufficient distance to allow the line to pass in front of them. In the case of Harrow, from the great increase of traffic at that station, it was decided, some time back-, to rebuild it, and that would be done in conformity with the proposed third
Ine of rail. It was not thought necessary to have a third line through Waiford tunnel, because St. Alban's branch was so very near, and no practical inconvenience would be
experienced or delay caused by stopping the trains at the north end of 'he tunnel, instead of owing them to travel slowvly for a mile and a-half. The estimate of 350,0004 inclufded the alteration of bridges and of making them of sufficient width not only for three lines, but for four, if necesiary. The estimate, besides being made ouna high scale of
pces, included a provision for contingencies, a margin of 10 per cent. being taken.
Mr. FnAIKLYN said, it was stated in the report that it would shortly be necessary to make a call upon the 12. lOs. i hares. Money could not now be borrowed at 4 per cent.,
and it would be rather hard upon the proprietors that they should be required to pay up under existing circumstanes. He suggested that the case sould stand over.
Mfr. DrIoxNsoss was not satisfied with the reasons assigned for laying down a third line of rail. It should ba remembered that the Great Western Company was going to extend its line to Manchester, and he apprehended that ihe effrect on the goods traffi_ of the London and NorthWestern, which was now very low, would be to reduce it ultimately below its present standard; the expenditure, therefore. for this additional line would probably be thrown away. He was strongly opposed to their going on year after year adding large sums to thoeir capital (hear, hear), so that there wasno finality, and they knew not what their pro. prty really was. It was a most unremunerative system.
jg nad 7o dqsire to oppose thoe diFvtors, JI wished tlQnm
to dotheir work for the benefit of their constituents, but he considered their views were injudicious, and he s a
tobjectionstolheir schemes. lnsnanyrespects, therefore, he could not acquiesce in the re,cort.
Jqi,r PVNCBM xaid, the most serious part of the day's businesshadreferencetothethirdline of railway. It was said that it was wanted in consequence of the mail service and otherfast train services, and that time was not kept, but was there no blame to be attached to the locomotive departroent? Sometimes 50 or 60 trucks were propelled by a power which was only equal to 20 trucks, while at other times engines were to be seen going at express speed with only four or five light truicks in their train. As to the estimate of 350,0001., hge did not betltevre t7hat tha sum woul phsiaye half the expense wvhich the proposed third line would incur. This outlay, however, having been proposed, itwas their duty, if possible, to devise a set-off against it by a reduction of expenditure. Ho proposed A Savlng of 50,0001. a-year on stations. There were 100 first-class stations, where a saving might be effected of from 3001. to 1,000!. a.year on each. Persons were advanced from working men to be superintendents at high salaries, and the consequence was they required a deputy, and the deputy required an assistant, nd the asistant wanted a clerk. They were thusfourdeep. With proper supervision there might be a great saving i
oil and coke, and smalU dvance might be madeon passengers' faret. The free-pass system and its abuses caused a loss of 26,000Z. a-year. The landof the company was under. let by 10,0001. a-year. It ought never to be let to persons being servantsof the comnpany. (Hear, hear.) Altogether, he was convinced that by theso and other measures that he could suggest a saving of 160,000Z. a-year might be effected.
Mr. HADIFL, M.P., said, he had forwaarded to the Board a series of questions suggested by the report of the Committee of Inquirv, and he was rather disappointed that the noble lord had not adverted to them in his speech. It appeared by the report that the disposable balance was 687,606 1ls. 7d., and that a dividend of 5A per cent, per annum was recommended, which would amount to 621,4841 thus leaving a balance of 66,121&. to be carried to the next account. Why should they make that reserve? The 66,000Z would make a dividend of nearly 6 per cent., and stil leave a balance almost equal to that which the Board held at the commencement of last year.
The CnAnisAw Faid, a dividend of 6 per cent.wouldleave a balance of just 4,000.
Mr. HA nrsznD regarded the large balance of 66,0001. as nothing less than apremiumto directors for indifference and extavnance. He complained of the present system on which the company was managed. Thirty directors were too many; if the number were confined to 15 it would be a great improvement. There was no efficient control over the Parliamentary and law expenses. A great reduction might be made tn the number of superintendents. The working expenses alone were 48 per cent., while those of other companies were 42, 41, and 40 per cent., some of them with a traffic nearly equal to that of the London and North-Western. He was confident that 8 per cent. might be saved in that direction. He must tell the noble lord and his colleagues that he was altogether dissatisfied with the mode in which they managed the concerns of the company Every railroad except Ajeirs was increasing their dividends. With an increase in the amount of traffic for the year 1856, over that of 1855, to the amount of 561,000C by one statement, and 520,0001. by another statement, they had increowed I heir half-yearly dividend only one-quarter per cent. He hoped the meeting would support him when he pro. sently proposed an increased dividend. (Cheers.) He felt confident that if their affairs were well managed the profits would pay the shareholders 7 per cent. He should op ose granting the 350,0001, for the third line of rail; and he should move an amendment that the dividend be increased to 6 per cent.
Mr. LocI;, [.P., said, that on a former occasion he stated that 40,0001. might be saved by assimilating the locomotive department of the northern division with that of the southern. The matter was taken into consideration. Some two years afterwaris a report was received from two very practical aud sensible men appointed to investigate the subject, and they showed that by economy a saving of between 30,0001L to 40,000& a-year might be effected. He wished to ask the chairman whether the directors had carried out that report, and obtained the results anticipated from it, and, if not, why not? It certainly appeared extraordinary that with such increased trac as to require the formation of a third line the Board could not pay more than 5 or 5.1 per cent. Ho could not believe that two lines of railway constantly loaded would not, with proper management, give the proprietors more than 5 per cent.
Mr. MAiS complained of the system which the directors pursued of using every means of increasing their amount of traffic, quite regardless whether it gave the pro prietors a profit or not; and he blamed the spirit of rivalry that was carried on with the Grand Junction Canal Company by carrying goods at such a reduced price as could never pay either company.
The CHAIRMAN said that, so far from desiring to run downx the roperty of the canal, the directors wished to prevent it. hey desired to obtain a remunerative rate of charge for the proprietors. In reference to free passes, the abuse of that system could not be anything like the smn of 26,0001. The free pass list was examined by a committee of the Beard every month, and the whole value of the passes during the year ending the 80th of June last, instead of being 26,0001.,was4,0441L nearly 2,9251.of whichLwas for passes for persons travelling for purpo^es counected with the company.
ohe remarks of M]r. Hadfield had been made in a spirit which he (the Chairman) could hardly have expected. The hon. gentleman had charged the Board with perpetual indifference to the interests of the shareholders. He denied most distinctly that charge. Hardly a day, nay, hardly an hour, passed m which their interests were not under the consideration of himsef and his colleagues. He also donied that the Board wero in a state of perpetual warfare with other companies. The present position of the company in its relation with the Great Western was an ample refutation of that charge. So also with regard to the Great Norther. The contest which formerly raged between the two companies had been settled by mutual agreement, and no longer was there any competition between them so far as regarded goods traffic. o far from desiring warfare the Board of Directors had rather strained a point, and had refrained from a contest in some cases where perhaps it ought not to have been avoided. With regard to the q,estions which had been sent to the Board by Mr. Hadfield, as being the recommendations of the committee, he begged to say, in reply to the first, that the question of reducing the number of the directors was one which was not quite open for the Board to entertain without a strong expression of opinion on the part of the proprietors. The increase of the Board, and not its reduction, had always been the act of the proprietors. Then, as to the control over the Parliamentary and law expenditure, the case referred to by the committee in their report had not arisen from making a re-arrangement of the scale of charge - but he desired it to be understood that the question was freqnently under their consideration. With reference to the locomotive department no further consolidat-on had taken place. The question was one of great imp)rtarce. It had been under the consideration of the boa-d, and also of a special committee of the board, but they had not thought fit as yet to make any consolidation of that department. ith respect to purchasing engines from manufacturers instead of manufacturing them by the company, the directors had considered, and the experience of many years had shown tbem, that it was quite useless to rely on the engines purchased from manufacturers. The company not only made better and more enduring machines themselves, but were also certain as to the time when theycould have the machines available for their service.
Mtr. TrTE, M.P., thought it better to postpone the calls on the 4 per cent, shares, aLnd that the p resent was not the time for expending 350, 0001. on a third line of rails. He would vote for a higher dividend if proposed.
The CkrAxsmas remarked that severel shareholders were favour of making the caUs on the 4 per cent. shares.
A PRoPsrETo 6said, that if they increased the dividend t 6 per cent. there would remain a balance of 9,0001.
The CmRujsaAs explained that if the dividend were increased as proposed thedividends on the StourVaUeyand Shropshire Union stocks must also be increased, which would reduco the balance to 4,5891. They should recollect the 14,000L had been brought into the account, so that they would divide 9,5001. more than was earned inthe ha.- year.
The roport and statement of accounts were then unanimously adopted.
On the motion for the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 21. 15s. per cent. for the half-year,
Ar. HADF:LD proposed as an amendment that the dividend be at the rate of 31. per cent. for the half-year.
Mr. Drcx?sox seconded the amendment; which, on a show of hands was carried by a large majority.
The CHsAntsR moved a resolution to authorize the expenditure of 350,0001. for the construction of the third ine of rails from Wlllesden to Bletchley and other works, and 25,3611. on various stations and sidings for increased accommodation.
Mr. HADnroD, Mr. DicneNsox, and other shareholders opposed the motion.
The CAIRMAN, Mr. GLYN, M.P., and 3Mr. BARROw supported it, and pointed out the necessity of the outlay to accommodate the traffic, and prevent accidents on that part of the line.
On a show of hands the motion was carried by 98 against 70,
The retiring directors, Mr. P. Benson, Mr. G. C. Glyn, ALP., Mr. T. Smith, and Mr. T. H. Thompson, were reelected.
Mr. C. AL Lushington, Mr. R. R. Dean, and Mr. 0. Dewhurst were nominated to fill two vacancies at tho Board.
and on a show of hands -Mr. Lushington and Mr. Dedhurs were elected directors.
Other. formal resolutions for the consolidation of 201. shares and 101. shares into stock were passed, and the pro. ceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chairman,

Steam Communication With The Brazils.-
STEAM COMINM CATION WTH TEE BRAzEs.- SouTAsrTsroN, Feb. 20.-The agents of the Hamburg and Brazilian Steam Navigation Company, whose vessels call at this port to embark a largo portion of their cargo, have made a renewed application to the Postmaster-General for a, ship letter mail to be made up for transmission by their steamers. The application has been a second time refused, in consequeneo of which it has been detormined to detain the Petropolis, which is to leave here on the 24th inst., till the afternoon of that day, for the purpose of giving the commercial honses of the north an opportunity of getting. their advices off, which may be received by the agents by the afternoon mail of that day. On a previous occasion we drew attention to the anomalies and commercial inconveniences resulting from the presentstate of tho law on this subject, and the loss to the revenue accruing therefrom. The ships of this line are of the first class, and last month the Teutonia (the pioneer vessel) made the most raDid voyage out on record, having arrived at Bahia in 20 days from this port - her sister ship, the Petropolis, promises to outdo even ti5s judging from the speed with which she steamed over from Cowes to Hamburg last week. The Teutonia left here on the 24th of December with a full cargo of goods, many of the invoices for which were posted and sent by the Colt, a smaller class vessel, which left the same day, and was allowed to carry a mail. The Celt put back twice, snd her mails were ultimately despatched by the Royal Mail Company's steamship Tamar, which, in her turn, was detained at Vigo by an accident for some 1S or 20 days, so that the invoices in question may be supposed to have now just about reached the Brazils, a month at least after the delivery of the goods. On the faith of the PosFt-office making up a mail the French merehants sent over a mail to go by the Teutonia, which the Post-office authorities kept for despatch by the Tamar. Such proceedings cannot but prove a serious interruption to commercial arrangements, added to which the posta revenue has to sustain a considerable loss of income. As soon as it was knoivn that the Teutonia would not be allowed to carry a mail the agents of the company at Southampton announced their intention to receive and forward letters; and the consequence was that on the day of sailing and the previous day Messrs. Croskey and Co.'s officoe at Southampton was transformed into a sort of postalsorting-office, and 2,00 or3,0Oletterswere forwarded in this way, which would otherwise have passed through the Post-office in the regular manner, and the public income of the country would have been so much the richer. The sooner the law on this matter is altered, and adapted to the present commercial requirements of the nation the better will itbe for all parties concerned.
THE: LIVINoSTOxE TESTuONiAL.-A preliminary meeting of the Liverpool African Association was held at the offices, Exchange-buildings, yesterday afternoon, for the purpose of making arrangements for a general meeting to consider the best means of giving expression to the appreciation of the inhabitants of this community of the great services rendered to coammerce and the cause of religion by the Rev. Dr. Livingstone by his African explorations. A committee was appointed who will report to a future meeting. The mayor, Mr. F. Shaud, presided, and there were p resent Mr. C. Turner, chairman of the dock committee; Mr.J. A. Tobin, Mr. Alderman S. Hoim, Mr. G. EL Horsfall, Mr. HIarrison, &c.
THE HOUSELESS POOR.-Three inquests were held at the London Hospital before Mr. W. Baker, coroner, on the bodies of three men who had died from destitution. The first was upon William Clerk, labourer, who suddenly expired in Rosemary-lane, Whitechapel, and who had, it appeared from the statement of DIr. Ryan, surgeon, of Leman-street, sunk from the want of the common necessaries of life. The second inquest was upon the body of a pcrson unknown, apparently from the dress a respectable mechanic, who had been found dead at 2 o'clock in the morning upon a doorstep in Mount-street, Whitechapel, and whose body had been immediately taken to the hospital, with the hope that life might not be extinct. The third was upon a Malay mariner, who was found in a state of great prostration in a neighbouring street on Tuesday afternoon, and expired the following morning. Mr. Samuel J. Burch, the resident medical officerof the hospital, stated in evidence that he was of opinion both tl'ese mert died from exhaustion produced by privation. The jury returned a verdict in all these cases that the deceased had died from "exhaustion, want, and privation." A strong feeling of indignation was displayed by most of the jury that an this Christian city three deaths from starvation should take place in one locality alone, and they strongly urged that the coroner should write to the Secretary of State, expressing, as their opinion on this important subject, that prompt measuresshould be adopted to provide for the houseless poor of this great metropolis. one julTnman remarked that the Whitechapel guardians refused rehef tocasual poor, and he has since favoured us with a copy of the notice posted at the Whitechapel Workhouse gates .
