THE SLA BE TRADE. TO TEE EDITOB OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-One point urged upon Lord Palmerston lbt week by the Anti-Slavery d4putation has apparently eso3ped notice-viz., the necessity for inflicting personal prnishment on the crew, or, at least, on the caotains of slaveships. In this the testimony of naval offioers and judges of mixed! commission courts, and the admi&sions of iavers themsdye3 agree. When it is considered that a good slave is worh 150. in Cuba, and costs 31. 8s. in goods on the coast of Africa, and that so enormous are the gains that slavers can afford habitually to burn their vessels a£ter the voyage, in orderto avoid) recognition, ib; cannot bedoubted that the risk of loEs is, in a mercantile point of view, scarcely appreciable. Risk of life, however, would confine the venture to the recldess few who would not shrink from piracy. It is said that such measures require the sanction of inter. national treaties, but papers or colours are rarely found in a slaveship taken on, the high seas. She can claim, therefore, no nationality. What mercy would be shown to the crew of a vessel taken under such circumstances in the Mediterranean, with a cargo of Frenchmen, for instance, in her hold, and strong evidenoe of several of them having been murdered in attempts to esczpe 7 Surely latitude and colour ought not to make so great a difference between the two cases.

A'UR'FOLK ISLAND. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,- In T2he Times of Wednesday appeared a letter under thesignatureof "John.tost," inveighing gainstth character of a Mr. Price, whose bratal murder in the exercise o' his office of Inspector of Convicts in Australia has just reached and shocked his friends, If the writer is the Frost of vhartistnotoriety, I am at a loss to understand why yot should have opened your columns to an attack from suctL a quarter upon a deceased magistrate, incapable by his deatlt of defending hinself aginst his calumniator. Assuming the identity, I do not wonder that the writer and myself Fee tho deceased's actions in a different light. I, too, have been in Hobart Town, and knew Mr. Price for several yeam as its acting police magistrate. I firat made his acquaintance there. Bat I was not, like Frost, during the time under his surveillance. I could clahn only his friendship. But surely my testimony to his mernts may be allowed to weigh against Frost's to his demerits, for the one cannot be more partial than the other. I assert, then- and Iam sure I am speaking the language of the free inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land, that never did police magistrate discharge the duties of his office (not an easy or irresponsible one in the capital of a penal colony) more zealously and more efficiently than the late Mr. Price; that the colonists had the greatest confidence in him; that his character as a gentleman and a man of honour was untarnished; and that he left to be Commiandant of Norrolk Island carrying with him the respect, the regrets, and the gratitude of us alL But it is for his administration in this Ftter island, as gathered from newspaper reports, that his accuser would have his name execrated-for what ? for bringing order out of disorder? which he emphatically did. And if in the process inexorable severity was his rulo (which I neither assert or deny, for I have no more proof of the one or the other than Mr. Frost), it would not surprise me, or I suppose any one else, when the desperate cbaracter of the comninuiity he had to govern is remembered. It may be said, such an attack from such a man was unworthy of notice. Perhaps it is. At least; Sir. 1 owe an apology to your readers and yourself for thus indin eu thier patience and your space. MIr. Price's antue and his. tory possess as little interest for the English public as my owvn.

PA'Ll&UMENTTARY TELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, F:mA, Juim 19. The LORD CHA?CzLLOr took his seat upon the woosck at 5 o'clock. PETITIONS. Petitions against the Bill for the Abolition of Ministers' Money were presented from vario placs in Irel%nd by the Earl of EGLINTON and Viscount DUNGARVON* by the Earl of DERBY and the Earl of Do0NouGutoRp, from Il[agheraoroms Rathronan, Kilglass Moira, Giuleabh, Tuam (2 petitions), Kyle, Roscrea, Drammaul, and West. port. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY presented a petition from civil servants of the Customs department at Lowestoft. pray. ing that the Act of the 4th and 5th of William IV., cap. 24, be amended in the manner provided by Bill (37) in session 1356; and one from the Lord Provost, raagistrates, and council of the city of Edinburgh, praying that clauses may be introduced in any treaty with the Emperor of China to isconrage the trade i3 opium. The hfarquis of WESTMI&STER presented a petition from Westmuinster praying for a settlement of the church. rate question. and from Chester praying for a better regulation of the fisheries. Lord REDESDALE presented a petition from Glocestershire against any measure which provided for the disolutions of maDrriage. ATROCMTIES AT SE. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY wished to ask the noble lord thePresident of theBoard of Trade whether his attention hbd been drawn to the report of a case which had been lately brought before the polioe office at Liverpool which involved circumstances of the most atrocious oruelty. It appared that a man who had been engaged on board a ship =s .g from Demerara to Liverpool had been subiected to the most atrocious cruelty by the captain and mate. He bad been starved, scourged, and put rQ irons, and a fierce dog had been set at him which tore his flesh and left buim lying in a peel of blood t,he consequence oP such treatment having bceen the death of the unfortunate victim. The case lied been brought before the police court at Liverpool, and he wished to knovr whether it lied attracted the attention of the Government, and also whether it was the intention of the Government to bring in any measure for the regulation of the mercantile marine. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY could assur his noble friend that the Board of Trade would always do their utmoat to prevent the perpetration of such atrocious cruelty as that to which reference had been made. In the case referred to by his noble friend the master and mate had been committed for trial and had been refused baiL During the last winter a similar case had occurred on board another ship, the matter had been brought before the Board of Trade, and the offending person baG been put upon his tri and sentenced to transportation for life. EQUALIZATION OF POOR-RATES. Lord BERNERS presented a petition in favour of the eqnalization of the poor-rates from the Greenwich Union, the vestrymen of St. Thonas's, Southwark, the inhabitants of the borough of Southlwark in public meeting assambled, the parish offBcers of St. George's, the vestry of St. George's. the vestry of St. Ann's, Blackfriars, from the ceniral committee of the Society for Equalizing Poor-rates and Uniformity of Assessment in Metropolitan Districts, which contained a tabular statement showing the great inerease in some and decrease in others, varying from Us. In some to 11d., 3d., end 6d. in others, and stating that the zateable value of property in the metropolis assessed to poor-rates was 10.000,0001. at an average of Is. 2.d. in the pound, while the gross value of properby was no less than 14,000,0001. One shilling in the pound was sufficient if poor-rates were equalized. The noble lord wished to ask tho President of the Council vhether the Government intended to take up the question, and bring inn general Bill extending to the whole kingdom, and embracing the questions of law of removal and settlements, of which the petition justly complained as oppressive to the noor and injurious to the employer. E:arl GRANVILE said that the Government had no such present intention. THE RESIGNATION OF THE BISHOP OP NORWICH. Lord REDESDALB rose, pursuant to notice, to call their lordanips' attention to the circumstances attending the resignation of the Bishop of Norwich. Their lordships must feel that, after what took place in the debates last year con. corning the resignations of bishops, it was impossible that they should pass over the vacation of a see without Parliamentary interference, and the succession of one bishop to ,the seat of another in that house, without some step being taken to ascertain from those who were principaUy re. sponsible for the proceeding, on what grounds they had acted and what they conceived to be the law which governed them in these cases. During the debates concerning the resignations of the Bishop of Durham and London last year doubts were expressed whether a bishop had any power to resign, and it was admitted on all hands that no provision in the nature of a retiring pension could be made without the sanction of Parliament. For his own part he thought then, and stiUl believed, that any rrangement for resigning -upon a retiring pension settled beforehand partook strongly of the character of inmony. It wa felt that there was some objection to the proceedings then under discussion, and a promise was given by the Government that a measur should be introduced to make a fixed and permanent provision for resignations of this sort. During that debate it was stated that the Bishop of Norwich, feeling himself unable to carry -on the business of his see, was anxious to rosign if an ar. rangement could be made for that purpose. Parlia. m.ent met early in the present year, and it was then stated by the Government that a Bill upon this subject was so nearly prepared that it would very shortly be laid before Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Circumstances then occurred which led to a dissolution of Parlia. ment, and when that was impending it was felt that itwoull be useless to introduce or to ask for such a measure, and therefore no steps were taken to settle this question. Just at the time Parliament was dissolved it was announced that the Bishop of Norwich had resigned, and that his successor had been appointed. The first question which he thought it important to settle was whether, according to the law, a bishop could resign. He was not himself disposed to dispute that the bishop had such power, but considerable doubb had existed on the subject, and he did not think that that doubt had been at all lessened by the alterations which had been made as to the seats of bishops in that House: because the effect of the resignation of any bishop was to introduce into that House another whose title to sit would depend entirely upon the legality of the vacancy. Supposing it to be per. fectly legal for a bishop to resig,l it must be admitted that it was desirable that some legislative regulations should be made upon this subject, becanue, looking at the peculiar circumstances which had attended the resignation of the Bishop of Norwich, their lordships must feel that there might arise in regard to it certain suspicions to which the church ought not to be subjected. Nothing could be moro dangerous than the mixing with the appointment of bishops anything of a political character (hear, hear) ; and it must be admitted that when a resignation took place at a time when Parliament was dissolved on account of a vote of the other House which the Prime Minister declared to ba a vote of want of confidence in the Ministry, and when the continuance of that Minister in office and his power to appoint a bishop depended upon the returns about to be Trade to the esisuing Parliament, their lordships must feel that a resignation made under such circumstances-he did not say that it was peculiarly so in the present instance,did give to the appointment of the successor a polittcal character which it was most undesirable should attach to it. He therefore thought it was most desirable that some legislative provision should he mad'e to prevent a resignation faking place in a manner so sudden and so summary as that in which the retirement of the Bishop of Norwich occurred. One thing bud given him the greatest satisfaction, and that was that in the case of this resifiuatiun there was no arrangement, and apparently no mtention of making an arrangement, for a retiring allowance. It was clear that the resignation had been purely and sincerely made, and that was a matter which reflected UDon the bishop the greatest credit, and removed from his risigna-,ion any imputation which might otherwise have been cast npon it, that it was made to favour a particular Minister. e sincerely trusted that in any general measuro which might ba introduced upon this subject, no attempt would be made by retrospective enactments to give an allowance to the late Bishop of Norwich. Such an attempt would deprive his resgnation of its sole virtue of having been made without any understanding that he should receive a retiring allowance. Having brought this subject before their lordahips. he trusted that they would hear from the noble and learned -ord on the wonlsack what was the law witls regard to the resignation of bishops, and would receive from some member of the Government an ssurance that it was their iate a- tion to proceed by some legislative enactmeats to regalate the retirement of bishops who were unable to perform their duties, and the making provision from some ecclesiastical fund for their support during the remainder of their lives. The LORD CaANCELLOR apprehended that there was not the least doubt in the world that according to law a bishop had power to resign, although it was true that in tha case of a bishop the metropolitan, and in the case of a metropolitan the Crown, must accept that resignation before it could take effect. Upon that subject he had no doub' whatever, but as his noble friend had given notice of this question he had thought it right to be prepared with authorities as to the law. To refer firt to the most popular authority. Blackstone, in his Commentaries, speaking of the resignations of the clergy, said,-" ALI resignations must be made to some superior, therefore a bishop must resign to his metropolitan, but an archbishop can resign to none but the King himself." The same statement is made ia nearly the same words in Burnss Eclesisticalc Lacw. To go backward, however, to earlier authorities. One of the greatest authorities on ecclesiastical law is Bishop Gibson, and he says,-" A resignation can only be made to 3 superior. This is the maxim in the temporal law, and is applied by Coke to the ecclesistical law, when he says, Therefore a bishop cannot resign to the dean and chapter, but it must be to the metropolitan, from whom he received confirmation and consecration."' What he meant by " can4ot resign to the dean and chapter" was this :-During a vacancy of the archbishopric the custody of the spirituali. tiez was with the dean and chapter, and what Lord Coke said in the passage referred to was, that in that state of things a bishop could not resign, because he must resign to his superior; and the dean and chapter, although they had the care of the spiritualities, were not his uperiors. This might satisfy their lordships, but in addition to this he would read them acape which occurred i1s the time of Queen Elizabeth or King James I., and which Vas recorded in Norman FzVnch. In that case it was held by Lord Colke tbat an alderman of a town, Boston-for Ins6hnco-who wa a justice of the peaeo by charter of incorporation could only resign lia offioe into the hands of a supenor, and Coke went on to Eay, " a bishop cannot resign to a dean and chapter, but only to the metropolitan." There was not, it was true, an instance of this sincethe Peformation, but before the Reformation there had beenL several, and the Reformation made no difference in 'this respect. In the time of Queen Elizabeth Archbishop Grindell proposed to resign, having becozae blind, but he died while the instruments were in preparation and before his resignation could be completed. On this part of the case there could be no doubt, but he had heard another. difficulty started-with no more foandation, certainly-as to what would be the consequences of the resignation. Would such a resignation, it was asked, remove a bishop from that House ? There could be no sort of doubt, he believed, on that point. There were plenty of authorities, and there was the analogous case of a translation, which, in his opinion, was suffeient to decide the point. The moment tnat a bishop had been translated, and confirmed in his new see, he had done that which wras analogous to a resignation of his old see. That in such a case a bishop lost his right tosit and vote in their lordships' HIouse until he had obtained a writ oE restitution of his ne temporalities, and a writ of summons commanding him to sit in that House was a matter admitting of no doubt. By accepting a new see he vacated his old see, and thus, ipso facto, lost his right to sit in the House until he obtained a new wrrit in his new capacity. There was one memorable instance of this, in which, if ithbadhbeen possible to get ont of the difficulty, there was no doubt that his predecessor on the woolsack, Lord Eldon, would have availed himaelf of it. During the time of the Qneen's trial (here Lord Broe=ham made an. observation wvhich wvas inaudible in the gallery), or, more properly, of the discussion of the Bill of Pains and Penalties brought in against the Queen, the House of Lords was called together for the consideration of that Bill on the 17th of August, 1820, and the roll of Parliament ws called over when the House met. Among the names of the bishop pTesent on that day vas that of the Bishop of Lincoln. In the July previous Dr. North, the Bishop of Winchester, had died, and the Bishop of Lincoln had been pro moted to that see, but had not becn confired in it consequently hisnameappeared in the rolls as Bishop of Lincoln on the 17th of August. On the next day, however he was not present, and on referring to The Times of the 19th of August-for there was no mention of the matter in Han-sard-he found that the Lord Chatcellor, on behalf of the Bishop of Lincoln, stated " that bis lordship had been present yesterday, but that he had to-day been confirmed Lord Bishop of Winchester, and, consequently, could no longer attend as Bishop of Lincoln, nor could he attend as Bishop of Winchester untiL his temporalities had been restored to him." If Lord Eldon could have invited the attendance of the right rev. prelate it nught be presumed that he would have done so; bat he felt that it was impossible, us the right rev. prelate, having been oonfirmed Bishop of Winchester, had ceased to be Bishop of Lincoln, and could not sit as Bishop of Winchester until he had received writs of restitution and smmons. It was perfectly clear Ithat a resignation put a bishopinthe sme positionasa tranlatioa. But there was a stronger analogy than tis in thecuseof a deprivation. A case of this sort was very much discussed both in and out of the House, in the time of William If L and Queen Anne, when prooeedings were instituted against Dr. Watson, Bishop of St. David's. for simony and extortion, and other high crimes and maisdemeanours, before the Archbishop. The result was that the charges against Dr. Watson were established to the entire satisfaction of the Archbishop, and he pronounced sentence of deprivation. While the matter was m progress the Bishop of St. David's endeavoured to obtain a prohibition from the Court of Queen's Bench, then presided over by Lord Chief Justice Holt, who scouted the notion of the want of power on the part of the archbishop to proceed to deprivation; and there was also an application to their lordahiEpe House to upset Holts decision, but that was equally unsuccessfuL The result was that the Bishop of St. David's was deprived of his bishopric by senteno3 of the then archbishop. His seat was consequently vacant, and a large party in that House thinking thatthe matter bore somewhat the aspect of a political persecution, as the bishop had been appointed byJames U., a great debate occurred, andit was moved and carried, if he remembered aright, to address the Crown not to fill up the vacancy until it was ascertained whether the archbishop had the right to deprive a bishop of his see. A. year or two afterwards, however, the see was filled up, during the lifetime of Dr. Watson, and nobody ever doubted that the new bishop had a right to sit in the House or that Dr. Watson had lost his right. Here, then, was the undoubted right of deprivation, and the analogies of translation and resignation to show rhat were the effects of that resignation. It would be absurd if the result were otherwi.e, for then there wouldbe sitting on the right rev. bench both the Bishop of Norwich and Dr. Hinds. No man sat in that House by right of his having been made a bishop, but by i'ght of the particular see to which he was appointed, and the moment that a prelate ceased to be bishop of a particular see it followed necessarily that he had no longer a right to a seat in that House. With regard to the resignation of the Bishop of Norwich, it was butjustice not only to that prelate,but also to the Government to say that that mignation was entirely his owc act, without the slightest stipulation or the least hope that anything would be done. (Hear, hear.) The rev. prelate felt that his health was in such a state as to disable hiiifrono discharging the duties of his office in a satisfactory mauner, and thereforet without the smallest sti nulation or even a hint that any provision would be uade for him, he said that whatever was the consequence he must reigu an office for which he no longer felt himself qualified. With regard to the introduction of a general measure, he could only say that all the members of Her Majesty's Government would feel extremely obliged to the noble lord if he would suggest a mode inwhich this question could be settled. The diffculty was to find the funds. The matter was under considoraMtion, and the Government hoped to be able to see their way clearly to a solution of it. It was a matter, however, which did not at all press, because there was no stipulation with Dr. Hinds that any provision should be made for him, nor had the Government received any intimation that it was the intention of any other member of the right rev. bench to resign. The Earl of DERBY reminded the noble and learned lord that last year, when the measure in reference to the Bishops of London and Darham was introduced, it was stated to be preparatory to a general measure. Towards the close of the last Parliament, too, the Lord Privy Seal, in answer to a question put to him, stated that a general measure was in preparation. Lord DUNGANNON confirmed the statement of the noble earL He himself had put a question to the Lord Privy Seal as to the intention of the Government, and was informed that they hoped soon to lay a Bill before the House on the subject. Lord C&MPBELL concurred in all that had been said by the Lord Chancellor as to the law on this subject. From the earliest time that he had been a student of the law he had always understood that a bishop must resign to Thae Archbishop, and an Archbishop to the Sovereign. Formerly the Archbishop would have resigned to the Pope, but since the Reformation, the Sovereign being for this purpose the head of the church, the resignation of the Archbishop must be made to the Queen. The resignation having been accepted by the metropolitan or the Crown the see was vacant. It was not the resignation but the acceptsnce of the resignation which vacated the see. In the session of last year a Bill passed that House with reference to the resignation of two bishops, but that was a Bill to enable them to retain certain parts of the temporali. ties of their sees after they had resigned. In the case of the 'Bishop of Norwich it was a simple resignation, and no Act of Parliament was necessary; but it was tperfectly clear that, though a bishop might remain a bishop, if he was no longer in possession of a particular see in connexion with the church of England he had no right to a seat in that House. He regretted that no general measure had been passed on the subject, and ha expressed an opinion to that effect when the Bil relating to theoBishops of London bad Durham was before the ouem. There could be no doutbt that the judges and thebishops shToulrd be placed on the same footing in this respect. Wen no longer able to discharge their duties the bishops should have power to resign on a decent allowance, and no room should be left for barann beItweenh a retiring bishop and the Miinister of theany, The Duke of NEWCASTLE regretted that the noble lor on the woolsack, while stating that a general measure wa under the consideration of the Government, should have expressed the opinion that the question did nob press. For his part, ho regarded the question as one of a very ereSSing nature. When the measure relating to the sees of London and D arham was before the House the necessity of a general measure was strongly urged upon the Government, and they now saw the result of thab course not having been adopted. A right rev, prelate who foand himself unable longer to dischrge his duties satisfadcorily had resigned hisbcharge, and had done so witkout receiving any provisionafor the rest of his days. It was most painfiil to allude to the private affairs of any individual, and his acquaintance with the late Bishop of Norwich was so slight that he was hardly entitled to refer at all to his case ; but he could not refrain fromsayig tat h fered he ightrev prelate was not in thepostio inwhch e oghtnowtobe placed. He had fro a ig seseof ut an hnou rsigned his see whee he foud hmsef nabetodichage hefntioso hi ofic;bhe nopn i wa oterwse,theactwasaUthe mnore to his honour. (EHear, hear.) Now, this was just one of those cases which a general measure would have met, and he could not help thinking that the Government had failed in its duty in not having introduced such a measure. (Hear.) It appeared even that a measure was not to be expected this session; and in the meantime other cases might arise of as urgent a nature as the present. (Hear.) When a BiUl was brought in it would, of course, provide for all future cases of episcopal resignation, but they might at the same time provide by ex postfacto legislation for the case of the Bishop of Norwich. (Hear, hear.) On the question of a pensi on being granted by an ezpostfactolaw to the Bishop of Norwich, he would of course exercise his judgment when the case came before them; but in the meantime he felt that a grave responsibility rested upon the Government by whose neglect this case was not provided for. (Eear, bear.) The nobie and learned lord had said this subject was beset with difficulties, No doubt it was, but it was not beset with greater difficulties than had been overeome by former Governments inL other cases. He saw no difficulty in arranging a scheme by which a bisbop should be aUlowed to retire on making due representation to his metropolitan, and should receive a moderate pension out of the funds of the bishopric, to that extent causing a 4iminution of the revenue of the incoming bishop. (Hear, hear.) Whatever inconvenience might arise from thia arrangement, he oonld not fora moment believe that it would interfere with the appoint- ment of good bishops, for be had no doubt that the ablest theologians, the ablest scholari, and the ablest parochial ministers would be quile as read as now to accept bishoprics. (Hear.) He a4st say, ao, that he shonld not regret any arrangement tht '4"uld tend to lessen the political charater of episopal sLppointmentg. (iear, bear.) He would rejoie in anything that would compel the Mini8ters of the Crown to look out for the Iest qualified men only to fiU the episcopal sees of this kingdom. ,(Eear, hear.) His great object in rising, however, was to protest aglainst the opinioa t-hat this quastiga Aid notslp± state his belief that it pressed nowv more urgently thal ever. (Hea, hear.) The Earl ol HARROWBY would not say that this qestion did not call for the earnest consideration of the Government. It had, in point of fact, been under the notice of the Government, but was not con. Sidered sO ,ressmg as other measures that occupiedtheir attention. lhe noble duke had referred to the drcumstance of the late Bishop of Norwich having retired withoat being entitled to any allowance. He believed that next session of Parliament a general measurowould beintroduced, and he would be happy to see that measure so drawn as to provide for his case. (Hear, hear.) The late Bishop of Norwrich retired when he found himself unable to discharge his duties, and certainly in any measure that was brought forward he of ll men should not; be overlboked. (Hear, hear.) The Dake of NEWCASTLE said the noble earrs explanation appeared to be that tho Government had not yet made up its nind in what shape provision shoald be iiade for the retiring bishop. If the pension of the late bishop was to be derivwd from a charge upon the revenues of the see it would be objectionable. The Earl of HARROWBY had not stated that there was any understrin with the late or the newly appointed bishop. What he did say was, that on any future meare upon the subject the Government would not allow the fact of the retirement of Dr. Hinds to prejudice his interests, TheDake of NEWCASTLE wishedtopointout that if theolatebishopvwastoreceive a third, or fourth, or any other proportion of the revenues of the see after his retire. ments the Government could not be said to have made any provision for him at all. (Hear.) The Earl of MALMESBURY regretted that the noble earl (Earrowby) vas not in his place when the noble sand learnedlord on the woolsck addressed the House, for the statements of the noble lords were oompletely at vaiance, (Hear, hear.) The noble ;and learned lord had said the Government had no scheme to propose, and he would bb obliged to any noble lord on that (the Oposition) side who could suggest a practicable measure. The noble earl, how. ever, told them that had it not been for the dissolution; a measure would have been introduced. It was olear, therefore, that before the dissolution some measure mnst have been prepared. The noble and learned lord also said that the late Bishop of Norwich had retired without any arrangement for a pension, a position in which he ought not to be left, as was admitted by the noble earl It would, perhaps, be better that the noble lords who Leld office under the Crown should not quit their seats at all during the evening, as that would appear to be the only way of avoiding arepetitionof such extraordinary discrepancies, (A laugh.) The LORD CHANCELLOR explained that he had not neant to say Dr. Hinds had no claim to a pension, but simply that there had been no stipulation unpon that point. The late bishop reengned purely and simply without any arzangement for pension, but of course if any general mea sure were introduced jusUce would be done to tha' meverend personage. He was of course quite cognizant of the B-U which had been referred5to by the noble earl (Rarrowby), whicb, not being so pressing as other mezsures, had.not. yet been submitted to ParlLiament. The Bar of DERBY reminded the able and learned lord that he had invited suggestions for such a Bil from noble lords who originated the discussion. (Hear, hear.) The LORD CHANCELLOR explainel that he hadonly said he would be glad to hear what the noble lord could say upon the subject, as it had been found by the Government to be one of far greater difficulty than it appeared on the first blush to be. Earl FITZWILLTAM said, as it appeared there was a measure prepared, he had some curiosity to ascertain its nature. The only sources he had heard suggested for pro. viding pensions for retiring bishops were the consolidated fund and the revenues of the sees vacated by the bishops. With regard to the first mode, he thought it would be very difficult to induce Parliament to awent to it; and as to the second, it would really be compelling a diocess to maintain two bishops inatead of one. He was inclined to think that any such provi8ion should be made from the general funds of the Ecdesiastical Commisseoners, and nc.t from the revenues of particular sees. The Bishop of OXFORD hop that no measure woul4 be hastily introduced, as upon this subject, which required mature consideration, a little delay was preferable to pre. cipitancy. He, however, wished to make a few observations upon what had fallen from two learned lords. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack was of opinion that the acceptance of the resignation of a bishop created a vacancy in their lordships' House, and had referred to cases in support of that view, but had not alluded to one which appeared to him (the Bishop of Oxford) to be the most important upon that point; he meant the case of Bishop Baucroft, who was not ale to take his seat in that Rouse during the interval between the acceptanoe of his resignation of the former see and his being confirmed Bishop of London. The noble ancd learned lord had referred to the case of the Bishop of Lincoln, and had stated that that prelate could not take his seat until he was put in possession of the .temporalities of the see. That, however, was incorrect, as the seat in that House was anite unconnected with the temporalities, and only depen ed upon confirmation in the episcopate. The noble and learned lord at the table (Lord Campbell) had quoted BlWckstone, but that authority had rather slormed over the case of an archbishop's resignation, saying that an inferior must resign to a superior, and there was no superior te an archbishop except the Crown, but he did not say that therefore resignation must be made to the Crown. Before the Reformation the Archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged the Pope as his superior, but uwbsequent to the Reformation all the powers which had previously been eumoy*d by the Pope passed to theArchbishop of Cauterbury. a snoble and learned friend, therefore, to make out his case must show either that the Crown was the spiritual superior of the Archbishop, or that by some statute or ac. knowledred church law it was enabled to accept his resignation. The only paallel case which presented itself to bis mind was the resignaion of the Pope himself, of which there had been instances, ThePope, having no apiitualsupenor, resigned to no spiritual superior, but simply abdicated, and such, in his view, must be the course pursued by an Archbishop in similar circumstances. Their lordships would see that the question was a very grave one, and it might be that the suggestion thrown out by the noble duke would be a better arrangement than any other which had been proposed. He trusted, however, that in a matter so deeply nfrecting the position of the bishops there would be nothing lke unaue haste, but that the Government before introduc. ing any measure woula give their best attention to it. Lord REDESDALE hoped that the general measure to which reference had been made would not be pressed with the same extreme rapidity as the Bil of last session prondiDg for the retirement of the Bishops of London and Durham. He acoepted the statement of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, that the resignation of the Bishop of Norwich was made without conditions-a statement which would free the resignation from the imputation of being a political rct-although the readiness with which the Lord Priv Seal had intimated that in any general measure which might be introdueed provision would be made for Dr. Hinds was calculated to lead to the supposition that some understanding did exist between the Government and the bishop. He trusted that something would be done to separate the appointment and resignation of bishops from the vcissitudes of political life. Earl GRANVIIMLE assured the noble lord that so far from there having been any understanding between the Govermment and the bishop, the resignation took place without qualification, stipulation, or expectation. (Hear.) Iord PORTMAN rose to say a word for the clergy generaUy. He could see no reason why the same provision on retirement which was made for a bishop should not be extended to a hardworking clergyman, unable from advanced age or physical infirmity to continue the discharge of his duties. (Hear, hear.) He also expressed the hope that the Government would not deal with the question in a hurried manner. The subjcet was then allowed to drop. CONSECRATED AND UNCONSECRATED BURIAL GROUNDS. Lord DUNGANNON presented a petition from ths Rev. William Palin, rector of Stifford. !3ssex, praying that a seleet committee might be appointed to inquire into the canonical obligations and usages of the established church in connexion with the subject of burial, with the view of allaying such doubts and disputes assnow frequently arise regarding the necessary and lawful incidents of aU new cemeteries constituted under Acts passed in the 15th, 16tb, 17th, 18th, and 19th of Victoria, or that a declaratory Act defining the same may be passed. The noble lord remarked that the main question in dispute was the nature of the boundary wall separating that portion of a cemetery which was consecrated and devoted to the use of members of the established church from that which was unconsecrated and placed at the disposal of Dissenters. It was much to be deplored that some declaratory Act had not been passed describing exactly what the boundary wall should be. Ho quite agreed with the petitioner that it was important the question should be set at rest, because it appeared to be giving rise in more dioceses than one to feelings of a very painful, bitter, and unpleasant character. He wished to ask the noble earl (Granville) whether the Government were disposed to introdoce a declaratory Act which might set at rest the question of the boundary line between consecrated and unconsecrated ground, or, if not, whether they would support such a BiU if introduced by an independent peer. Lord WENSLEYDALE said that there was no occasion for an explanatory Act. A dispute arose in the diocess of the late Bishop of Carlisle, and he had occasion to consider the whole subject very fully. It was perfectly clear to him that the 85th canon, which required the church. wardens to put a fence or wall round the churchyard, had no reference to the line of demarcation between the consecrated and unconsecrated parts of a common cemetery, but only reqiired that the churchyard should be fenced all ronud. The object of the canon was to secure that the churchyard, which was the place of interment for all the parishioners, without distinction of religion, should be protected. lt therefore declared that a competent fence should be provided to resist the inroads of trespassers and beasts, and to prevent the churchyard from being desecrated. The canon had no referenco to the distinction between consecrated and unconsecrated ground. What that division should be-whether afence or apermanent line of demarcation, such as was notlikely to baeobliterated.-migbt, he thought, easily be arranged between the bishop and the Icemetery board, the latter of these divisions between con- secrated and nneonsecrated ground being quite enough to ratify the canon. Lord REDESDALE did not see how according to the canon that part of the cemetery could be called the churchyard which was not consecrated. He certainly was not surprised that the bishops should adopt the view impeached by the noble and learned lord. After a few words from the Earl of HAEnROWaY, The Earl of iAIMESBURY said he had presented seve- xa petitions on this subject, and their lordships had ap. pointed a committee to consider it. Their report, however, had no legal valae, andit was likelytobeadead letter. It wAS understood iht the Government intended to make some use of their lasours, and he regretted that they had not embodied their opinion in a Bill. L,ord GillPBE,LU,aid it would he very satisfaousory .t-) him- to Ave soDme definite rule laid down on this subject, aL at presents therewas8some litigation going on in the; court over whic hepresided in connexion with it Re thought the rule laid down by their lordships' committee might be embodied in a short of Act of Parliament, Lord DUN-GANNON sdd he regretted the existence of the present anomalous state of things to which he badAlloed theirlordships' attention, and sincerely hoped that in end would be shortly put to it. He could not help thinking that if the Government were to bring in some short Act which would define what was tobe considered a boundary betweea consecrated and unconsecrated groand in public cemeteries, a painful and constantly recurring subject of discussion I would be henceforward avoided. . I The Bishop' of OXFORD said the question vas already i apidly settling itself. Cemeteries in his own diocess had been constituted without any difficulty arising. The conclusion of the select committee had gradually heiped matters to a settlement, and he thought it was generally understood that that was to be a compromise which wrould be satisfactory to both parties. The subject then dropped. THE CIVIL SERVICE. Lord BERNElERS resented certain petitions, numerously signed, from the civl servants of Hler Majesty's dockyard at Sheermes and from Woolwich, praying for the abolition of abatements from their salaries, and for the adoption of a more liberal scale of superannuation allowance. SMOEB NISANCE (SCOTLAND) ABATEMENT BILL. This Bill, after certain verbal amendmentg, made at the Euggestion of Lord Kinnaird, passed through committee. TRANSPORTATION AND PENAL SERVITUDE BILL. On the motion of the Eal of HA'Rrow*:Y, that'thbi Bill be read a third time, an explanatory clause was added at the instance of the Lord Chancellor, the object of which, as t,e understood, was to empower the court to make a second sentence of trnsportation cumnulative on a prior sentence, a doubt having isen whether that could be done under the 7th and 8th George IV., cap. 28. i The Earlof AIRLIE wished toask Her Majesty's Government whether it was their intention to take any steps with the view of counteracting the evil consequences which mu4t follow from the discontinuance to a great extent of the punishment of transporttion beyond the seas under the operation of the present Bill and of the Act of l85l, The Earl of HARROWBY was not prepared to give a decided answer to tho question of the noble earl. The subject to wrhich it referred required the most mature codldideration, but he was disposed to think that the on1l remedy for the evi apprehended would ibe to lengthen th; terms of imprisonment for inoorrgibMe offenders.M lord DUlNGANNON repeated his opinion as to the u4satisfactory nature of this BiLl Earl GRANVILE sid that in the then state of the Htou (there were hut flve Peers present, including tlie Lord Chancellor), he did not feel 3ustmfed in prolonging th'e discussion, and thus subjecting the noble and learned lord on the wooLsack to the punishment of solitary confinement. (A laugh,) After a few words from Lord A:nnEoxn, The Bill was read a third time and pused. Their lordships adjourned at half-past 7 o'clock.

TErE DESIGNS FOR lPUBLIC OFFICES. On the motion that the Hous at its rsing adjourn, to Monday, lord ELOHO asked whether, after the decuion .fthe commisioners, the exbibition, of designs for public offices in Westminster-hall would be opened for. few days to enable the public to compar those which had received prineg.with thosewhiph had uot (7{bear, ber.) Lord J. MANNERS ale wihed to put a quecsion to the right bon. baronet on this subjecte Gould- he inform the House when it was likely thereport of the judges appointed to consider these designs wonhlbe presented? Sir B.

The models were likely to be of a very valuable nature, and the whple of Westminster.hall could not be throwun open without expoEing them to great damage. With regard to the question as to wlhen it wu likely the judges would come to tbeir decision on, the designs, he had every reason to believe, from the communications he had had with those gentlemen, that they would be able to make their award on or about the 25tklinst. As soon- as their award was given he would tAke care to make it kcnowi to the House.' In order that the public might view tle designs which had been selected by the judges he proposed to pace around the Hal all thoee to which premiums might be awarded. The models would be arranged upon tables in the centre of the Hal, in a mnner well adapted for their proper inspection. THE GENERAL VALUATION OF IRELAND. MIr. GROGAN rosetoak*theChancenorof the Exchequer whether it was the intention of the Government 'to make any change in the raode whereby the expenses of Carrying on the annual reison of -the general valuti onfd Ireland- were a present raWd? The hon. gentlemen explained. the circumstances under 'which the valuation ws orui.2aly underttken and effected, and the purposes to which it was applicable. The et of its execution hd exceeded 357,00, which had bmenetirely defajed by the counties of Ireland, and, though the -rork was perfect when first completed, itg annual revison ws rendered neoseary by the changes constantly occurring in the various town. lands nd tenements throughout the country. The valuation had not onyproveduseful i the assessment of county cess and-poor-rate, hut had been,of the greatest servioe to the Goverment in the levying of the income-tax, the leguy and succession duty, and various other branches of the Im. Pena revenue. Having hitherto paid the whole charg, of this valuateon, the counties of Irland felt that they had done all tht could fairly 'e required of them, and they now looked to the Government to defray the expense attending its annual revision. The Government made infinitely greater use of the valbation than the counties; and, as the object wa therefo;e anational one, theo ountiesofIreland naturally complained of the whole burden being cast upon them, and had petitioned 'the Hbuse for a new atrrgement on the subject. . . The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the valuation of Ireland, .to which the hon. gentleman had referred, was first -introduced with exclsive reference to the county cea Itwas an improvement upon theprevious system; nevertheless it was not free from objections 'The Irish Poor Law introduced a' further change by which a separate asaessment WAs made of the rateailitof each cecupier, instead of an aseement being made in gros upon the whole of a town.Lsnd, the burden of which the inhabitants had -to istribute among hemse. That new mode of assessment had nothing whatever to do with the general taxation of the country. It ws a purely local affair, for which ea loc lity ad to jay, as was the case with the parnshes and Poor Law Unions i this country. The national Exchequer had afforded very considerable wsistanoe in the formation of this vluation' by defrayig the expenses of the Ordnance survey, which was not, e the Ordnance survey of England, merely for the purpose of making a geographical map, but on a le of six inches to the mile, and wu intended to asit in the formation of local asseeSments for taxes. He was not sufficiently acquainted with the operation of the laws relating- to this subject, but it ws open to the hon. gentleman to prove to the House ona, fittmng occasion that there were iuijustices in connexion with the, whicb. required abolition. At present he saw no reason to accede to the proposition of the hon. gentleman. that the national E txchequer soauld make a contribution towrards the revision of the knell assessments of Ireland. Colonel FRENCH supported the views of the hon. member for Dublin, whose pln he thought a perfectly fair ane. The Government should give the peonle of relnd the nomination of their ownL offioers, inw -Pich case the were perfectlY ready to pay for such services as were rendered;; and the Government ought not to take upon themselves to nominate officers, some of whom were incompetent, -to direct everything wrhich was to hce done, and then call UpOh the grand juriesmen far more conversnt with the work ~than anybody else-to pay for it without inquir. (Her, SE:RVICE OF CRIMAN OFFICERS. Mr. W. EWART asked the Under-SeretaT for War whether there would be any objection to print hereafter-am amended copy of the returnu made this session relative to the service of offices in the Crimea in consequence of the accidental omision of oertain names in that return? - Sir J. RA MSDEN said, it wAs ordered that the names of those officers should' be publiihed who remainedin the Crimea from thefirstlanding to tbe end of the war, with the exception of the intervalduring which some of them Might have been absent from sickness or on leave. A doubt arose s to whether the names of those officers who did not go with the expedition at the first landing, but who went subsequently and remaine4 to the end of the war, except when absent on leave or through sickness, should be inserted in the list, and this was the reason why theyhad been omitted. Several hon. gentlemen in this House had represented the case to him, andhlie had communicated on the subject with Lord Panmure, who immediately gave instructions for the prepartion of a supplementar return containing those names. This return wrould he laid.before the House as soon as it ws ready. (Hear..) ORDER OF THE BATH. I Mr. F. SCOTT asked why a retirmi of those who had been decorated with the different orders of the Bath since .18, which return was ordered. by the House in March at, ad not yet been presented ? Lord PA,LMERSTON subsequently stated that.the return was being prepared, and should be produced as soon as possible. CRUISERS ON THE COAST OF CUBA. Sir G. PECHELL inquired of the First Lord of the Admlralty whether it was intended to increase the number of cruisers for the suppression of the slave trde on the coast of Cuba ? Sir C. WOOD was understood to intimate that this was the intention of the Government CIVIL ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE ARMY. Sir H. WILLOUGHBY said, he understood that an Order in Council, dated the 5th of June, 1855, for reguating the civil establishments of the army, had been revoked. That order stated the duties of all the officers with some details, and prescribed how the civil departments of the army were to be carried on. It appeared, however, that it had been wholly revoked, and that there was now no document on the table to show how the civil establishments of the army were to be governed. Not only had the order been cancelled, but, as he understood, certain offices had been altogether abolished and a new system had been established. ie wishedto askthe noble lordatthehead of the Government, whether he would explain to the House how those establishments were to be carried on for the ftture, whether there were any Order in Council of which the House had no cognizance which gave the necessary detail, and, if there were, whether the noble lord would lay iton the taLble? Lord PALMERSTON said, that the Order in Counlo to which tho hon. baronet had refered had been revoked by another order, which, however, did not substitute any new regulations for those contained in the revoked order. He would confer with the War Department with respect to the propriety of issuing another order. SALARIES, &c., OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS. Sir DE LACY EVANS moved for a detailed account of the saaries and expenses of the House of Lords, for which a sum of 22,900WL was required in this year's estimates, in aid of the fee fund and for salaries, in the same form as the estimates of the salaries and expenses of the House of Commons. The CEHANCELLOR of the EXCEEQUER said that, if the hon. and gallant gentleman would reter to the report of the Comnittee on MisceDaneous Estimates of 1818, he would find this subject explained. The House of Lords paid a portion of the expenses of its officers out of the fee fund; but that fund was not adequate to discharge the whole amount, and' a vote therefore was required to cover the deficiency. The practice of the House of Lords waS to settle the salaries of its officers, and to send a statement of the deficiency to the Treasury in a gross sum. The Treasury laid that gross sum upon the table of the House -of Commons and asked 'the House to vote that amount. It never had been the practice hitherto to take any steps for ascertaiuing from the 0ouse of Lords the detaled items ot which the gross sum was composed. Those items were not in the possession of the Treasury, and they_ were therefore not Iid upon the table of the House. If any steps were to be taken in order to obtain those items he apprehended that it must be done by a mensage to the House of Lords, or by some means of that sort, because it was clearly not competent for the House of Commons to make an order for a return upon the House of Lords. Sir DE LACY EVANS then withdrew his motion. ROCEDALE ELECTION.-PRIVILEGE General THOMPSON said, that a petition had just been put into his hands, and as it related to a matter of privilege presoed that he could present it at once.

LONDON, SATURDAY, JUNK 20. 1857. In the House of Lords, last night, Lord REDESDA2L called the attention of the Ilouse to the circumstances which attended the Designation of the See of Norwich by Dr. EnTDS, und wished to know if the Goverment were pre. loared with any measure to facilitate the resignation of Bishops who were unable to discharge their episcopal functions ? The LORD CsANxELLoB. entered at length into the state of the law as regarded the resignation of Pli-hops in general. With regard to this particular case, Dr. RiwDs had reaigned the See of Norwich, without any stipulation as to a retiringpension. The great difficulty would be where to find the funtds for such a pension, but the Government hoped to arrive at a satisfactory solution of this diffliculty. Aftet sorme further discussion the matter was allowed to drop. The Transportation and Penal Servitude Bill was then read a third time and passed. Some other business was also despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned. In the ERouse of Commons, on the motion that the House at its rising do adjoura till Monday, several questions were put to the Government and answered; one, by Lord ELaHo, relative to the late exbibition in Westminster Hall of designs for new public-offices; auother, by Mr. GROGAN, as to the intentions of the Government regarding the mode of raising the money for the expenses of carrying on the annual revision of the General Valuation of Ireland; a third by Sir G. PECHLL, who inquired whether it was intended to increase the number of cruisers for the suppression of the slave trade on the coast of Cuba. Sir C. WOOD was understood to give a short affirmative reply. The motion for adjournment was agreed to. General TnoAn'soN presented a petition from JoHN NEwAL, the petitioner against the return for the borough of Rochdale, complaining that one PETER JoHNsoN had offered 501. to one ABnRAAu ROTUWELL, an elector of that borough, to induce him to go to New Orleans in order to avoid giving evidence on the election petition. The Gener moved that witnesses be examined in support of the petition forthwith. The motion being agreed to, J oH NFrwAuz and ABRAHAM ROTHWELL were examined at the bar, anid the latter stated distinctly that Jon?fsoN had offered him 501. if he would go out of the country, anld abstain from giving evidence before the Election Committee. On the motion of Lord PALMrsrToN, PE R 'JOHNSON was ordered to attend the House forthwith. On the order forgoing into Committee of Supply, Lord C. HAMILTON asked what steps HER MA.iJSTY's Government had taken to obtain compensation for the British subjects residing at Greytown, whose property was destroyed when that town was bombarded in 1854 ? Lord PALMTERSTON replied, that the transaction was one which it was impossible not to characterize as a very violent and very cruel proceeding. It was authorized by the Government of the Lnited States, but it reflected no credit upon the Government which ordered it or the officer who . xecuted it. But the question was the bearing of international law upon the case, and the Government had been advised, and he thought rightly that the British subjects at Greytown had no ground to call upon their Government to demand of that of the United States compensation for injuries suffered in the attack upon that town. Lord LoVAiNE accused the Government of a vant of energy in this case, which was not shown towards weak and feeble Powers. Mr. RopmuxCy observed that Greytown was colonized under the protection of this country, ind if there ever was a flagrant case of subserviency to the strong on the part of our Government, this was such a case. It was not only a cruel but a ,li,honest proceeding on the part of the United States' Government, and if the scene had been China or the Brazils " the honour of the flag of E?ngland" would have been mouthed all day. Mr. BEzTiwosK was of opinion that our proceedings with regard to outrages committed by the Government of the United States were more likely to lead to, than avert hostilities. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that the conclusion reluctantly come to by the law advisers of the CRowN was that satisfaction could not be demanded of the Government of the United States for these losses, and the Government of France had come to the same conclusion. Mr. Di%RAELi considered the reasons assigned by l ord PALMERSTON unsatisfactory, and demurred to his exposition of international law. Helinsistedthat France had demanded reparation for this outrage, liut that there was a broad distinction between the English and French sufferers. He did not despair, he said, of ultimate redress. Lord J. RuSSELL thought the Government could have done no more than refer the question to the law officers of the CRowN, who were of opinion that by the law of nations it was not -competent to the liritish Government to require satisfaction and reparation in this matter from the United States, atid he saw no reason to doubt the soundness of heir opinion, or how the Government could, after this, make a demand for redress. But tbere was *ne circumstance which, in his opinion, would have j"stified a demand for explanation. The house of the British Vice-Consul had been set on fire, with the British flag hoisted over it, and be thought the British Government might have required a declaration that no insult was intended to the flag. Sir D. NoRRBys moved an istruction to the committee, that " If a member raises a discassion on any item of the estimates, by proposing that it be omitted or modiSed, the Chairman sball confiae the discussion to that item until it shall have been disposed of by the committee; and that the question shba be put oa the item under disouasioa sepa. r .tely and apart from the other items comprising the total amount to bevoted." The motion gave rise to a dry discussion as to the expediency of the change and the mode of effecting it. Ultimately the motion wvas withdrawn, Lord PALMIEnsTON consenting to the proposal to refer the whole subject to a committee. Tne House then went into a Committee of Supply upon the Civil Service Estimates, when certain votes were agreed to, after debate, and ordered to be reported. JOUN LORD, a person stated by AAHsAM IorWFLTL to have been present when PETER JoHN_SO oflered him 501. to absent himself, was examined at the bar. PETFR JOHNsON not being in attendance, althouuh served with an order to attend, was ordered to Ybe taken into custody by the SERmEANAT_ARSIs, on the motion of Sir G. GREY. The ATrouNBY-GEERtAL moved that the whole subject of the charge made by RoTrnwELL should be referred to a select committee. After some conversation, the SPEAKER having declared that the course proposed was according to precedent, the motion was agreed to. Mr. CHEETHAMI then moved that JoE1N LORD (who bad admitted that he was present when the offer was made by JoxNsox to RoTHEWLL, and heard it) lie taken into custody; but, after a short discussion this motion was withdrawn. Mr. BuTT moved that LORD be recalled to the bar; but this motion was negatived on a division, and he was simply directed to attend the select committee, which was nominated, and was ordered to meet this day. The remaining busine3s having been disposed of, the House adjourned at five minutes after 2 'clock until Monday.
This being now a new Parliament, and the third session, and near the end of it, since the conclusion of the war, all the honours, promotions, and pen)sions having been assigned, some men having succeeded beyond their expectations and others having settled down into hopelessness,-all the Commissions having reported, and all the Acdministrations and Departments been more or less whitewashed,-Lord PAh31unx being comfortably ensconced in the War-office, and being, as we are assured, on the best possible terms with is RovAI BIoHNEss across the Parade,-there appears to be a general untying of tongues and deliverian of consciences. WVhat Festival was at hand that we should have such a military shiving as that on Thursday evening ? The fae. is, the masquerade of official impeccability is over; Generals and exCoitnissioners are taking >ff their dominoes and relieving themselves wi Lh plain-speaking. Nobody can be always wal'Ang on stilts or strutting iii a Court dres. W'lat was whispered in the ear is beginning to be proclaimed from the housetops, and, if we may judge from the freedom of language slhown by General PEEL and those who followed him, it only wants a properly worded motion, at a good opportunity, early next session, to bring upon the floor of the House, not only aU our own comments on the management of the late war, but a good deal more besides, now only circalating about c3ubs and round dining-tables. This time last year the phalanxwas very strong and compact against us. Everybody who thought he had in his kit the materijls of a field-marshars baton, or the more numerous classes that either wanted 201. a-year, or dreaded having 201. a-year less, passed the word, " Wlhatever you do, don't write to Z' The Timts." Ignorance, impertinence, graphic writing, cold-blooded indifference to the miseries of overworked officials, and a gainful gloating over the horrors of the battle-field, were some of the lighter charges brought against us, some people being of opinion that we were deliberately selling the cause of our country to the Russians. In those days to be abused by us, to deserve it, and to brave it, were as good as a pension or decoration. ARl that, however, is now passing away. History and truth are resuming their dull sway. It is now stated in the House of Commons, with the general consent, that the Departments responsible for the administration of the war were in a state of conI fusion, none knowing quite what they had to do. It is now admitted that the Board of Ordnance, which had a very large responsibility, and for which our Commander-in-Chief in the East was solely responsible, was in an utterly inefficient state, not only in its organization and officers, but particularly, as Lord PALMESTON adds, from the great mistake of ailowing Lord RAGLAN to retain it with his command. It is admitted-nay, more, it is charged to the excessive jealousy of the House, to the incubus of "Parliamentary " government," that the lower, but not less important, branches of the serv,ice concerned in feeding and moving the sound soldier, ancd curing the sick aind wounded, were grievously hampered with a redundance of forms and a vast circuit of inquisitions. It is volunteered by the very men who sat on the Chelsea Commission that there 'was needless bad management, needless because the result of system, though inevitable under that system, and pretty certain to recur on the first occasion of trial. Stich is the long-predicted phase of this af}air to which we have at length come. All this would, of course, be very consolatory to us if we could only be sure of a corresponding improvement in the system confessed to have been in fault. it is true that we are now told everything is brought under two departments, instead of half a dozen ; that one department has the politics, the finance, and the responsibility to Parliament ; the other the discipline, the promotions, and rewards, and the virtual responsibility of high character, of aristocratic connexions, and close relations with the Court. It is out of the question that the Horse Guards should do anything unfair or dishonourable; so we are assured, and so we gladly believe. We are also told that the two Departments are in close confidence and frequent communication. More than this,-an exact and definable relation, capable of being put upon paper and laid before Parliament, so far tending to unity, Lord PALIERSTON thinks would be as a wall of brass between the two Departments; and it is even intimated that the two chiefs of our military administration consult one another as unreservedly as two members of one Cabinet. Then, with regard to the relations of these apparently disjoined but really united offices to the subordinate Departments, there has been a great simplification of forms, and in the event of a war there will only be one or two requisitions where there were half-a-dozen or more. All the high military experience of the Crimea has been carefully collected and husbanded by the appointment of many Staff officers; and, should such an occasion come again, we shall have plenty of men ready for the emergencies and acquainted with the routine of a war. Indeed, they are now simplifying that routine. It is true that some Commissions of Inquiry are still sitting, particularly one on the requirements of a military education; and, pending that inquiry, no new orders about examinations or promotions can be promulgated. But all diligence is used, and when any paper is drawn up that may be considered final, and will bear pub. lishing to the whole world, the Army and the House of Commons will have it. Meanwhile, if any officer ever finds himself at a loss he has only to consult the regulations of the service, and he will find his place in the routine. Then there is the Army Reformatory at Aldershott, where, we are assured on the best authority, men and officers are really learning the art of war, and, if anything, rather too hard worked. There are actual field-works, roading, draining, pontooning, water-filtering, and a great deal more. There are 12 instructors with fuU classes, and the air of the place, indeed of the whole British Army, is as professional as the warmr'st admirers of continental armies could desire. As assurances and promises are all we are likely to get for the present, we must be content with them; but it is rather hard upon Parliament to call this Parliamentary government. At this moment, when General PEEL asks what are the relations of the Horse Guards and the War-office, and what actual improvement there has been on a confessedly complicated and inefficient system;when Mr. ELLICm adds his authority to the question;-when General CODRINGTON gives his opinion that the unity of administration that was proposed has not yet been attained, and cannot be under two officials with correlative powers not defined;-when he adds it would be difficult to say who is responsible for any particular regulation or point of discipline;-and when Lord PArL3sERSToN even defends the absence of definite relations, it is quite evident that the House of Commons has little more to do with the administration of the British Army than the French Chambers have with the army of our Imperial ally. Who does govern the Army it may not be so easy to say. The truth is, that armies have a tendency to a sort of self-government, not always consistent with the welfare of society and the integrity of constitutions, or even of thrones. There was an aristocratic army in Imperial Rome; there was one in the metropolis of the Eastern Empire ; there was more recently one in its Mahomedan successor; as also in Egypt. The character and career of these armies are well known; so also is their fate. The questions have often been asked, how were they governed? Who paid themt What chief did they acknowledge? What were their relations to the other powers of the State-? These questions have never, we believe, beemt satisfactorily answered. We have no fear of a Prastorian Guard in this country. We shall never see HER MAJBSTY escorted by Janissaries, or British Mamelukes in possesion of the Wellington and St. George's Barracks. But, we repeat, armies have an evident tendency to self-government. So the government of an army andl the relations of ita chiefs are not matters that a constitutional State can afford to leave wholy unsettled and unknovn. At all events, this in not Parliamentary government. Should thivga fal into disorder, should the iliness or removal of the chiefs bring to light an arrear of neglwt or an accumulation of abuses,-which we do uoi ourselves even suspect, -or should a suddea -war, even this very wa with China, -revw3 the satne confusion, the same IinefjienenY, f2 s-ae atuipidiAy as before2-whjich we do think highly possible, -let it not be charged upon Parliament. That gentle body is now acting the part rather of idle Emperors than of meddling Senators; it readily accept assurancem and promises; it loves to be soothed and mystified; it is glad to hear that things are all right, or will be Boon; it asks no further questions. This is not Parliamentary government. Nor is ours Imperial. If no one else governs the Army, it can only govern itself; and we hope it will show more virtues of selfgovernment than some of its predecessors.
We certainly cannot regret the reverse-the first of the new Parliament-which the Government met with on Thursday night. The 25-inch survey of Scotland is one of those absurdities which from time to time raise up plain men in insurrection against pedants, and honest men against jobbers. The fact is simply this,-that uuder the direction of the Government and at the expense of the country a map of Scotland has been begun which, if completed on the same scale, would be 250 yards long by about 200 broad, which would cover the Art Treasures building at Manchester, and if placed upright would be about twice the height of St. Paul's Cathedral. It is said, indeed, that the remote wilds of the country were not to be represented on this colossal scale. But the landowners of the Lothians and Lanarkshire were to be furnished at the public expense with these enormous and, unnecessarily accurate plans of their estates. Let us consider what such a survey as this actually-means. England and Ireland have both been mapped on a scale of six inches to the linear or 36 square inches to the square niile. This has been found suflicient for a most accurate representation of the face of the country. In towns where it is of importance that every, shop, every yird, every lamppost, and every drain should be marked, a larger scale has been taken, but the six-inch has been sufficient to give fields, ditches, and lanes of a size perfectly suited for practical purposes. And when it is considered that a county 60 miles long and 30 broad covers on this scale the floor of a goodsized room, the old survey will certainly be satisfactory to all but a few scientific enthusiasts. But when Scotland wvas to be surveyed the sixinch scale was suddenly objected to as ridiculously small. Some measurements of a larger kind had been made on the continent, and, of course, we must have something similar ; so it was resolved to produce a map of the 1-2,500th part, linear measure, of the country itself, or of about 25 1-3 inches to the mile. What this means is easily made plain to the imagination. A walk of half-a-dozen miles before dinner would take one through more than 12 feet of map. A rifle would carry right across one of the sheets, if the latter were to be made of a convenient size. As for a ride or drive, it would be necessary to cover a roomr with paper in order to take in the beginning and the termination. The plan resembled nothing but the conceptions of GULLIVER, or of the philosopher who proposed to dig geometrical figures on the earth large enough to acquaint the inhabitants of the moon with the fact that we are intellectual beings. The towns were, we believe, to be represented with still more extraordinary dimensioms-namely, on the scale of 1-500th part linear measure, or more than 10 feet to the mile; so that London, if north of the Tweed, would have a map some 80 feet long and 60 broad. Now, we are always hearing from a certain class of the little that the State does for science. While the plain working men of the country are constantly making new and surprising applications of natural laws,-constructing Great Eastems, Crystal Palaces, and tubular bridges, the professed sasans do nothing but complain of Government ignorance and neglect. They have for once had their way, and in the Scotch survey we see the kind of hobby they are fond of mounting. We say nothing of the landed proprietors, though they can hardly be acquitted of a desire to obtain minute surveys of their estates at the public cost. This cost was calculated at 2,000,0001. for Scotland alone. If the work were to be carried out, England and Ireland would, of course, put in their claims to a similar measurement, at an expense altogether of probably 6,000,0001. more. Certainly, at a time when not only the regular economists, but sensible men generally, were complaining of the great increase of the Civil Estimates, it became the House of Commons to pause before giving its sanction to so wasteful and unnecessary an undertaking. The job has, consequently, now been frustrated by a vote in a fuU House. Scotland must be content, like England and Ireland, with a survey more within the limits of reason and the public purse. If any Thane or Laird wishes to have every barn or cowshed on his property delineated on paper he must pay for it himself. It was, indeed, too absurd that while Kent and Surrey, where, even at many miles from the metropolis, houses are thickly strewn,-while Lancashire, where we only leave the smoke of one town to get into the smoke of auother, are content with the six-inch survey, we should set about mapping moors and mountains on so gigantic a plan. We believe that the commencement of this undertaking has been due more to professional and local influence than to the opinions of any intelligent body. The geographers were against it, the Civil Engineers were against it, and the public, if they had been informed on the matter, would have at once made the remonstrance which has at length come through their representatives in the vote of Thursday. The subject is, indeed, one upon which it requires no great discrimination to pronounce a judgment. Undoubtedly there are objects for which a large plan is desirable or necessary. If a man wishes to drain his property or to transfer a part of it, it is, no doubt, advantageous to have a plan of it as large as a dining-table. But Parliament can in justice only authorize expenditure for national and general purposes. The nation wants a fair map for military purposes, for purposes of assessment, or for scientific investigation. There is abundant evidence that, excepting in a few thickly populated localities, where villas, factories, and farmhouses jostle each other, the sixinch scale is quite sufficient. If it had been proposed to lay down the country round London, or South Lancashire, or the West Riding, or the Glasgow district on the 25-inch scale, not much would have been said, but the scheme, as it stood, wan too much for the patience of a taxpaying assembly.
In the financial discussions in which the House of Commons has recently spent almost every Government night a very remarkable fact may be discerned in peculiar prominence amid all the arguments, estimates, and speculations to which the various portions of the subject have naturally given rise. Every branch of the mational expenditure has shown a certain tendency to increase, the feature being just as plain. in the civil services as in those connected with war. But, whereas this current of affairs is nanifest to everybody, it is also apparent at the same time that there is no proportionate increase of the sources of revenue likely to be forthcoming. That the Income-Tax sbould cease and determine at its appointed- time is a condition whiclh has been insisted on with extraordinary precision and unanimity, while the imposition of new taxes -would be a measure which, thanks to the fortunate circumstanceN of the country, nobody so much as contemplates. Indeed, if we omit the exceptional necesities of tbe war, ourfinancial policy for some years past has consisted in selecting for remission certain taxe3 which the invincible elasticityof the revenue, aidedby the Income-Tax, enabled us annually to reduce. But the Income-Tax has now done - its work, and the contributors to that impost have a right, as well as others, to relief in their turm. If our expenses were gradually diminishing the prospect before us would involve no embarramment; but, as the contrary happens to be the case, how are we to escape from the dilemma? The national accounts are but just balanced as it is; the Income-Tax is already largely reduced, and is marked for extinction altogether; new taxes are out of the question, and yet the demands upon the Exchequer seem to threaten an increase year after year. Unhappily it is impossible to deny the progressi've expansion of the national outlay, and, what is perhaps worse, it is -not easy to condemn it. No doubt, the aggregate results are well calculated to excite opposition, but these results are composed of itemB every one of which has been sanctioied, if not by unanimity, at any rate by preponderance of opinion. Generaly, indeed,- any new expenditure undertaken by Government imnplies simply the satisfaction of some long-felt desire-of some want which has at length been irresistLbly expressed. Different men may have different hobbies, but as a general rule it may be safely affirmed that iu the present day every fresh outlay in this or that department has been strenuously advocated by some class or other, and not successfuly impeached by any. In fact, what with the natural diffusion of improvement, the acknowledgment of just claims in al quarters alike, and the progress rendered necessary in every department by that of the rest of the world, reforms become inevitable, and, as they also inevitably cost money, the conclusion seems forced upon us that in certain branches the expenditure of the country should increate. lIow, then, are we to get out of these difficulties ? Are we to continue the Income-Tax, impose new taxes, or have recourse to loans ? Every one of these expedients would be objectionable. To prolong the burden of the Income-Tax after the stipulations made for its remission would not only be unjust to thoEe who have borne this oppressive duty so patiently, but would be an act of impolicy in itself. The very essence of this tax is in its exceptional character and in its adaptation to great public emergencies. It is said to be incurably vicious in its incidence, and its anomalies are only palliated on the ground that the tax is not like other taxes, but resembles rather a war contribution, being imposed at periods when money must be had promptly and in large sums. Upon these assumptions it has been endured; but, if it is to be made an ordinary element of revenue, its inequalities must be removed, or, in other words, as statesmen concur in assuring us, an impossibility must be performed. As to new taxes or loans during the time of peace, we need save ourselves the trouble of discussing such measures; and if, therefore, we cannot provide fresh means, or escape fresh expenses, how are we to make b)th ends meet? We may well look with some anxiety to the Budget of 1860. In all speculations of this kind considerable reliance may be placed on the resources which the progress of events in a great and prosperous country never fails to develope. Time usually brings with it some solution, more or less unforeseen, of al such political dilemmas. The productiveness of the actual revenue above the estimated amount has of late been so constant an occurrence that we may almost include it in our reckonings, and though, no doubt, a portion of this surplus may be absorbed in such further reductions of taxation as policy may require, there will always probably be an excess rather than a deficit in the means on which we count for the service of the country. This, however, is not the source to which we should look for aid. We believe the apparent difficulty of the case arises out of the assumption-hitherto, we confess, sustaiued in some measure by facts-that, while new expenses must be incurred, old exrenses must be preserved undiminished. Here, it appears to us, is the error in the reckoning and the loophole for escape. We certainly cannot doubt that, as years roll on, fresh applications of public money will be incessantly suggested, discussed, and resolved upon. It is in the very nature of things that such should be the case. But it also is, or should be, in the nature of things that these successive outlays, being dictated, as we must presume, by evident expediency, should bear their proper frluit in saving us outlays in some other direction. If, for instance, we spend more upon education, we ought to be taxed less for crime;, if we succeed, after our. expensive efforts, in the reformation of criminals, we ought to pay less for police. In some cases, indeed, the adjustment of the balance is immediate; as, for instance, where local charges have been transferred to the Consolidated Fund, and where it is clear that what is added under one form of taxation is subtracted under another. Perhaps the qzid pro qzuo may not be so immediately attainable in the military and naval departments, but the principle ought to operate nevertheless. If a steamer costs more than a sailing vessel, the saving of time which can be effected by such means should count for something in public as well as private concerns. If our soldiers are better clothed and better treated,. the fact should have its influence in the recruiting department; and, if their weapons cost more money, they ought to give equal efficiency to a smaller numerical force. Moreover, some positive reductions must surely be possible, considering how. constantly we are told as much by persons who. ought to know. Ilost men who have been long in service profess to see their way to retrenchmentin some direction or other. There is yet another point of some significance. in this question. The present period is, as the prase - goes, a period of "transition." We are clemring, off some remaining scores of the war; we are- oompleting our steam marine; and we are prcs'idiiw our land forces with entirely new weapons. It- is obvious therefore to argue, that when, these incidental expenses cease to affect the Estimates a. considerable reduction will be accomplished ipE facto. We cannot profess to attach wny- grea weight to these calculations. Of cou.e, tbese. particular expenses will terminate soma. day, but others of a like description are only tbo sun to, succeed them. In some form or othe there iust. always be a demand for contingenci3st. though thb contingencies of one year may diftsu -from those of the year preceding. Looking zat the nisacli o science and the necessity of keepim& abreat of al inventions, it would b1 hard to, say tiat 16tit may not bring with it novelties aid obigations of its own. What if thLe Great E3astern should be the model for all ships of the lineeorthe naewD Lo guns for all artillrry ? We should be glad to wee expectations rea7,ized on this head, but we are not very sanguine, In fas*, we have been in a state of "4.ransition!' these many years without ever getting mniuck nearer finality. We rely for our escape, then, on the skill of our fiuanc rrJ, operating on a field yielding many opportun ties, and, stimulated by the very difficulties beawf. them. I this respect, indeed, it is highly ~ti'faetorp to see the embarrassments ahead xo clearly diswrned, and the conditions so noDOutelyr accepted. When paymasters button up their pockets beforeband economy becomes a necezsity As well as a virtue.

Well distributed, it will serve, we think, to provide all we w=ant and in the meantime. there can certainly be siotbing injudicious in resolving that we will not spend any more.

FOREIGN INTELLGBNCB. FANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRP,APn. \ riho following apoazed in our secoxd edition of ye3. Merdav :-1 PARIS, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 6 P.M The Si&de has received an official warning (avertisesment) for its article of yesterday on the elections. The avertissement is signed by the Minister of the Interior, but is said to emanate from the pen of a higher personage. It states, tbat as the offending journal had been previously admonished twice, it might, in virtue of the law on the press, be now suspended. We are therefore to infer that forbearance as been exercised towards it in the present instance. The aSicle will, no doubt, feel all the ga,titude that a lover of the freedom of the press can feel for so signal an actof mercy; it wil be content with sitting under the weapon now suspended over its head by a still finer hair than that which supported the sword of Damoclea " Considering," observes M. Billault, Thet in this article the SiMcZe, not content with attribustin exclusively to the candidates of the Opposition, whom it describes us Democratic, the monopoly of the great prindples of 1789, imputes to the electors who may vote for the Government candidates the intention of injuring the causE of families by the right of primogeniture and by reigious marriage-of menaoing property by establishing, under the deceitful name of testamentary freadom, the sight of despoilingchildren for the benefit of religioussocie. Iies-of endangering the cause of cvilequality, that of the freedom of thought, of speech, and of writing, &c.; "Considering that the Government of the Emperor, based as it is on the sovereignty of the people, and on the principles of 1789,-the foundations ever durablo of French society,-cannot allow the ideas of order and progrees which it represents, and the electoral m- which ap. proves them, to be thus calumniated ; ""That the SiMe, having already received two offlcil warnings, might, in virtue of tho law, be from this day sus. yended, but that the Government, which has lefc to the electoral contest the gesetest latitude, does not desire, how. ever justifed It would be in so doing, to stop during the last days of that contest one of the most animated and mnoa aotivo organs of au Opposition the object of which publio opinion will appreciate,-that it (the Government) cannot, however, avoid warning it that it will not allovw, for tho advantage of a sterile gitation, the loyal intentions of a policy which produces glory, pence, and security for the country to be thus misrepresented; wherefore, on the proposition of the Director-General of the Publio Security, a wrang is given to the Siclc," &c. Of the prostrate condition to which the press in France is reduced by the law, which places it completely at the mercy of the Government, it is superfuousto say anything. The Siirle has certainly employed the language which has brought on it this third chastisement. It may be said that the arguments it made useof against the Goveramentcandidcateswere not well founded, as nowhere has anything beea a3id by them, in their addresses to the electors, advocating the right of prinogeniture, exclusively religious marriages, or the power of bequeathing property to religious corporations. These are the favourite views of the Umvsers, but I do not remember to have seen them advanced by candidates as grounds for election to the Legislative Body. It is, however, no justification for this new attempt to impose silence on the SilMe. The Government has at its disposal several organs in which the Si&le might bei answered, and its errors, if errors it has committed, be exposed. And what isthe Moniteurfor? The Moniteur, which has moralized with so much unction, and denounced with so much vigour the misdeeds of the Kaimakan of Moldavia for influencing the elections in that Principality, and for obstructing freedom of speech, might, onthepresent occasion, refute the arguments of M. Havin, without employing the " strong hand" in its cause. It is said that when the avertissement was communicated to the ,Si&ce the first idea of its conductors was to publish an article much stronger-an article such as it might have written when the pres was still free, boldly attacking the Government and defying its utmost vengeauce-in fact, to strike one brave blow in the cau,e of liberty, and then, folding its mantle about it, await its fate in calmness, and courage, and fall with honour. On reflection, however, other couneels prevailed and the last hour of the SiMce has not yet aoun3ed. In the meantime the question of the elections grows more animated as the date of their opening approaches. In some of the Mairies the applicants for voting tickets are more numerous than was expected. Men are stationed at the entrance distributing bulletins of both parties to all who enter and to all who pass. The prospects of General Cavaignac's success are on the increase, and it is said those of two or three others of the Opposition ; and if the Democratic party had acted together, instead of being split into fractions, it might have a majority in Paris. As it is, the Government is said to have serious apprehensions about General Cavaignac, whose election, though he will not preeent himself in the Chamber, but reslgn the day after bis nomination, would be an unpleasant check. I alluded the other day to a circular, said to emanate from the Socialist Democrats abroad, and circulating in Paris and the departments, strongly dissuading the people from takingany part whatever in the elections. M. Louis Blanc, itwas also stated, dissented from that opinion. I now hear that a pamphlet or circular from M. Louis Blanc himself exhorta the electors to come in crowds to the poll, to vote, of course, for the candidates of his party ; that these candidates shall, when returned, present themselves in the Chamber; shall, when the oath is tendered, refuse to take it; and then make a solemn appeal to the people, and a protest against tyranny. What cbance there is of these injunctions being obeyed canmot yet be said. MX Vavin, the candidate of the Sikcle for the eighth circumscription, has intimated his intention of withdrawing from the contest. His competitor in the same district is M. JulesSimon, who is the candidate put forward by the Electoral Committee, also in the Democratic interest. M. Jules Simon is a Republican of the moderate school; he is a man of great attainments, irreproachable reputation, quiet and moderate iu deportment, and is respected by aU -who know him. He was formerly Professor of PhUlosophyat theCollege of Louis leGrand, andresigned on refusing to take the oaths as a public functionary, to the Imperial regime. V. Vavin apprehends that such a name is one of too much influence for him to contend against with sucess. It is to M. Jules Simon's credit that his repugnance to be included in the same list with such a candidate as M. Darimon, the disciple of Prudhon, but who is accepted by the Sicle and the Journal des Debats, led to his separation from the party represented by the former journal, and to his joining the Electoral Committee of the Rue (Gaillon, of which M. (Garnier Pages and others of the same school are at the head. The simple-minded Mayor of Chaton, who thought that the principal recommendation of the Government candidate for the Seine-et-Oise connisted in his being the son-in-law of the Prefect of the department, has got into a scrape. His excess of zeal haa been very badly received. The Prefect was so furious that if hebhad had the Mayor in his hands when he read the address it is not improbable he would have gone to greatlengths. It appeara there, are private circumstances which make the affair atill more provokin The Prefect of the Wautes-PyrWn6es hasa sus. pended from the exercise of his functions M. Ferr6, Mayer of Tarbes, who had suffered himself to be proposed as a candidate in opposition to the Govern. inent candidate. The Mayor has resigned, and his example has been followed by one of his deputies. M. Jean Reynaud has offered himself as a candi. date at Metz, in opposition to the Government candidate. In the Dordogne the Mayor, who declared him. rwlf in favour of the Opposition candidate, has been auspended from the exercise of his functions. At a Cabinet Council held yesterday at St. Cloud it was resolved not to make any change in the functions of M. Pietri, the Prefect oi Police. Another plan which was in contemplation has been abandoned. M. Fould, the Minister of State, is expected this afternoon in Paris from London. It is said that M. Magne will then take leave of absence, and that M. :Fould will in the meantime manage the Finance Department. It is aaid that the screw steam-transport La Seine, lately fitted for sea at L'Orient, is to be sent to reinforce the French fleet in the China Seas. The Monitur publishes the official return of the Customs revenue for the month of May, which amounted to 18,580,184f., being an increase of 2,492,7JA)f, qB the corresponding month of 1856, on that of 1855, The first five present year show a total amount of re*ip yt J8,42o,848, being an inmrease of 10,746,102f. on the corresponding period of 1856, and of 7,931,100f. on that of 1855.

The supposition expresed in my letter of yesterday that this Govc-mmsent was about to refute certain defamatory charges recently made aoainst it by some of the organs of the Belgian and Prussian press was correct. The Oesatrchishee CUorpondenz of last night had a long official article on the subject:- " The Imperial Cabinet Is well plemsed to see that the foreign press begins to take an inaterest in the internal development and foreign polioy of Austria. If a paper expresses erroneous opinions on any patcolar subjectit is for the other organs of the pre to contradict them; but if by a misstatement of facts the policy of a Govemment is placed in a false light an authentio correction becomes necessary. If, after having recelved sutch correction, an incorrect statement Is repeated, it becomes an 'intentional falsehood.' Not long ago, the Outerricaische Correspondenz contradictedfi in the most dositive terms, the asSertion of the Ind,endancesBedge, that the Imperial Cabinet had endeavoured to persuade the Neapolitan Court to break off its diplomatic relations with 8ar. dinia. The paper in question mnst have known that the refutation emanated from an 'authentic' (official) source, bnt it replied by a flat contradiction to the refutation it had received. An erroneous statement now made by the German papers is, that the Imperial Cabinet 'has complained to the German Courts of the policy of Prussia on the quos tion of the Danubian Principalities.' Whenever an lotimately connected Power does not sbare the opinion of Austria on any point the Imperial Cabinet endeavous to come to an understanding with its and that without refering the matter to other Governments. "When the public prem aecseo the Imperial Govern. ment of aotions emanating from impure motives, or ofnon. German sentiments, a shar reproof becomes absolutely necessary, and we therefore declare the asertion that Austria has complained in Paris of the impetuous conduct of Prussia on the Danish-Holstein question to be ialse. In the wholo history of Austrian diplomacy there is not a single example of the Imperial Government having proposed to mike foreign Powers umpires in matters exclusively German, or of her having demanded or 'voluntarily'acceptedforeign intervention. Aus8ra and Prussia go hand in hand on the matter in quesion, and neither Power has cause to com. plain either of the impetuosity or of the want of energy of the other." The foregoing article is remarkable, inasmuch as it contains a tacit acknowledgment that the Aulstrian Government has some respect for public opinion. As you are aware, the Ifldiendanee Belge has been prohibited, and the measr gave such extreme dissatisaction to many persons of rank and standing who have long been accustomed to read the paper that some justification of it appeared necessary. It pains me to be obliged to state that the public attributes to the Minister for Foreign Affirs the prohibition of the Belgian paper. The Viennese are by no means surprised when they hear that the Department of the Interior has been "running a muck" against some organ of the press which has ventured to hint that the Jesuits are likely to be the bane of Austria, but Count Buol has always been considered a man of so elevated a character as to be indifferent to the unjust charges every now and then brought against him by the pubEc press. His Holiness the Pope made his solemn entry into Bologna on the evenmg of the 7th instant. The whole city was either at the windows of the houses or in the streets through which the cortNge passed, and great appeared to be the loyalty and enthusiasm of the people. After having heard Te Deum in the Cathedral, the Pope walked to his Palace, from the balcony of which he gave his apostolic blessing to his subjects,. It seems that the Austrians played the principal part in the festivities of the evening, for the troops " had a torch procession with evolutions." There were nine Austrian Generals, with a brilliant suite, in attendance on the Sovereign Pontiff, who would probably be delighted if he could manage to keep his subjects in proper order without such ruinously expensive luxuries as foreign troops, It has been officially made known that the Austian diplomatic agents will act for Tuscany in all Russian towns in which the Grand Duke has no representative. The envlrons of this city are already beginning to be crowded with troops, and some 40,000 or 50,000 men will be present at the military mass on Thursday. General Count Nostitz, the only Prussian Knight of the Order of Maria Theresa has excused himself on the plea of ill health. 1is Prusuian Majesty, on learning that the Count would not be present at the festival, declared that it was " sehr 4nangenehm, seehr fatal" (very unpleasant, very annoying.) Accounts from Verona, of the 15th inst., state that Marshal Count Radetzky was quiet during the previous day, but that he had not slept during the greater part of the night. PRUSSIA. (FROM OUR OWN COBRESPONDBT.) BERLIN, Juan 17. The news has reached us from Windsor that January 18 of next year has been definitively fixed on for the nuptials of the Princess Royal and Prince Frederick William. Originally the Prince's own birthday, October 18 of this year, was selected for that event, probably by the young Prince himself, and subsequently the Princess's birthday, November 21, wvas decided on as a more fitting occasion, it being the day on wvhich she will complete her 17th year. The Palace that Prinee Frederick William and his bride are to reside in cannot by any contrivance be finished this year; and as the painting, &c., cannot be done before the winter it will evidently have to be finisbed, if not in fact commenoed, when spring returns next year. The idea has therefore been already given up of their taking possession of their future abode on their first arrval here. For the summer a convenient suite of apartments is now being arranged for them at the Prince of Prussia's seat at Potsdam, Babelsberg; and during the time that elapses between the entry into Berlin and the removal to that summer residence the young couple will occupy a suite of apartments in the Royal Schloss. Not far from the future residence of the Prinoess Royal a very handsome hotel has been erected, which bids fair in its arrangements to eclipse all its rivals, inasmuch as it has been built expressly for an hotel, with the full determination onl the part of the proprietor to make ample use of all conveniences of water and gas, and various mechanical contrivances that have been introduced into Berlin since the other establishments were opened. This new botel exhibits one unusual feature; on every floor there is a large common room for reading, waiting, or receiving visitors, apart from the sleeping-rooms of the guests, or the general dining-room of the table d'h6te, and, as your readers will guess already, the faQ*de of the building, which abounds in nmarble steps, sculpture, and flowers, bear the name of "Hotel d'Angleterre" At the other end of the town also a theatre is fast approaching completion, which is to rejoioe in the name of Victoria Theatre-an appellatios, however, by which no connexion of ideas is desired to ba establisihed with its transpontine namesake in Iamnbeth. Au it ia a special aelight to this theatreloving population to visit -Jr.matio perfor&nnces in the open air during the summer months, this theatre is so constrmcted that the stage, which is 80 feet wide by 80 feet deep, serves in that capacity either for a winter theatre, with accommodation for 2,000 sitters, in a warmed room with roof and chandelier, three rows of boxes, proscenium, &c., or for a summer theatre for a similar number of persons sitting by daylight under the free vault of Heaven. For special occasions of "grand spectade" the double stage can be thrown into one, and for festal occasions, such as public balls, the two entire theatres can be metamorphozed into one saloon by boarding both the pits to the level of the stage. Attached to the sunmer theatre is a large garden, which is being laid out by an artist of acknowledged skill in such 3natters.-Leun6, who fLnds luxuriant foliaoe there ready to hia hand, the effect of which he will heighten by fountains and sculpture, and the architectural elevation of the wholo building proniises to rival, if not to outshine, that well-known and elegant place of public amusement aO Berlinl, Kioll's garden. It is the present; intention of the proprietor to inaugurate the winter portion of the theatre by its firat public performanco the same day as the Princess's nuptials takeplace in England..
IBA.L WAY -AND MINING SsARES. The rilway-market was steady to-day, and in some cases there was a tendenoy to further improve. ment. loreign and colonial were also rather firmer, but business was not animated. Ba g and miscellaneous shares exhibited no particular alteration, although quotations were fairly supported. An increased amount of operations are, however, recorded in these descriptions. - .

I AIONBY-MABK. aT A d (XTYIJiTZLLIQAZWE -r1iday Evewng. The funds have been steady to-day at the slight improvement of yesterday, but the market sbowj little tendency to animation. Consols for the 9th of July opened at 93i to i ex. dividend, and returned to that price after a short period during which there were buyers at 93k. Money was in demand during the morning at the Bank minimum of 6 per cent. Later there was a better supply. Bank Stock left I off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 92 to.k; New Three per Cents., 92k to 93; India Bonds, 8a. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 98g to J; andExchequerbills, 2s. discount to 2s. pm. Foreign securities were steady, but the operations 'Were not generally important. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 96i and 4, and for the account at 96J, i, i, and . Bnsrnessin the Four per Cents. Guaanteed took place at 101I for money and 102 for the acoount, The general I tnaotions momprised-Brailian Five per CentL, 100k and _; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Hlf per Cents., for the account, 77i; Rusian Five per Cents? lIl; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 99- Sardinan Five per Cents., 89i and 89; Spanish bhree per Cents., for the account, 42i; the New Deferred, for account, 26 and 26i; Swedish Four per Cents., 84; and Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cent., 98j. In the foreign exchanges there was no important alteration. Paris was a shade lower, but Amsterdam and Hamburg fully maintained the rates of last-post. TEe Paris Bourse eems totally. ineapable of revivaL Neither the reduction in the Bank of England rate of discount, nor the intimation that further artificial'supplies of gold are not required for' the moment by the B7ank of France, has sufficed to atop the downward movement. The closing quotations of the Three per Cents. this evening were 68f. 40c. for money and 68f. 65c. for the end of the month, sihowing a docline of an eighth. The corn-market this morning was again firm at the improved rates of Monday. The report of the tiverpool cotton-market for the week shows an aetive busijess, and a slight advance in quotations. The very favourable fadt as regards the financial prospect of the next two or three months has just transpired, that the Danish Government are -not likely to withdraw from London the 1,125,0004. which England has agreed to pay for the redemption of her share of liability on the Sound Dues It is reported that the Danish Government intend to appropriate the amount in part liquidation of two 5 per cent. loans contracted in this country of 800,0001. each, which they will have the option of paying off respectively in 1859 and 1860. The question whether the money should be left in deposit until these periods or holders should be induced, by the offer of a premium, to bring in the bonds forthwith is believed to be at present under consideration, but the conviction is that in no case will any operation arise that can have the slightest effect in disturbing even temporarily the position of our money-market. About 30,0001. out of the last arrivals of Californian gold was taken to the Bank to-day. The precie amount of the specie shipped by the Pera is 1,142,6161., of winch 1,140,473. is silver, 638,2101. being destined for Eongkong, Canton, and Shanghai. The only gold is 2,1431. for Ceylon and Madras. 'This is the heaviest shipment ever made, the largest previous total having been 971,3281. at the beginning of February last. It was announced to-day that the acceptances of Messrs. John Longton and Co., of Liverpool, ship brokers, have been returned. The liabilities of the firm are stated to amount to 75,0001. The rate of discount continues to advance at Hamburg, and is now 6 per cent. The produce-markets during the week have been characterized by general steadines, and, notwithstanding the increased supplies brought forward, the late high quotations for many of the leading staples are well maaintained. Sugar, however, forms an exception, and ha3 again experienced a decline of ls. to 1. 6d., the recent heavy landings at this port having led to a temporary falling off in the demandfor the hometrade. Still the stocks in firatand secondhands are so moderate that the market, it is thought, cannot long remain inactive. Coloury kinds of plantation Ceylon coffee have advanced is to 2a. The last transaction in good ordinary native growth was at 663. A large quantity. of Mochs is declared for public sle next week. The latest accounts from the continent continue favourable to holders here. Several sales of the better kinds of rice are reported at lower prices. In spice there is a steady busines, and pimento, pepper, and cassia ligaea all realize an advance. The saltpetre-market has been dull, with small transactions at Ia. 6d. decline, chiefly upon the fine descriptions of Bengal, and there is nowr rather a large stock in firsthands. A fair amount of business has been transacted in tea at improving quotations. The public sales which commenced last wreek terminated on Monday, and a large quantity has been since disposed of. A publicsale of the Assam Companys and alsoof Chinese growth will take place on Tuesday. The report of the committee appointed in April last to investigate the affairs of the North British Australasian Company has been issued to-day, and its developements are of the same class as those lately made with regard to the Australian Agricultural Company, the North Europe Steam, &c. Owing, however, to some of the property of the concern having been properly attended to while r. reckleas outlay was taking place elsewhere the results on balance have been less injurious. The great loss had been on a copper nine, now abandoned, called the IEnwan, in New Zealand, where the manager-a Mr. Beeger-is alleged to have been left without coutrol, although his expenditure at length advanced to 1,5001. per month. The general cost of management, both at home and abroad, is likewise declared to have been extensive, and the committee recommend great reductions. With reeard to the lands of the company in Australia it is recommended that attention should be concentrated on the Rosenthal estate, comprising 195,000 acres, and believed to be one of the finest sheep stations in the colony. Most of the others being outlying estates, it is suggested that they should be disposed of to save the expense of a divided superintendence. The arrangement for selling the Bon Aceord Copper Mine, in South Australia, for 8,0001. and a royalty or 1-20th is also approved. Finally, the committee consider that, supposing the Bon Accord sale to be carried out, a dividend of 5 per cent. might be paid, leaving a balance in hand of 5,0001. At a meeting of the St. John del Rey Mining Company, held to-day, a dividend of 11. per share less income-tax was declared, and the report and accounts were, aftersome discussion, adopted. The accident at the Bahu Sump, through which the produce will be diminished and the outlay increased, was the chief subject of remark, it having been alleged that, with proper precautions, the fall of ground might have been prevented. The explanations of the directors were, however, received as satisactory, and it was intimated that the whole of the correspondence can be inspected. A resolution was passed authorizing the use of the reserve fund for the reinstatement of the property, and the managers were urged to exercise economy. Annexed is an abstract of t-he report- " The directors preset a repozt of prooeeaings during the past year. On the 21st of November the directors declared the 29th half-yearly dividend on the shares of the company, at the rate of 20s. per shar.

The net profit on the working of the mines for the psast year has beeni 23,2331. The number of tons of ore raised during the year ending the 31st of December, 1856. has been 89,877. The nuumber of tons raised in 1855 was 87.297; the number of tons of'ore stamped in the year ending the 31st of December last was 87,424 ; the hiumber of tons stamped in 185 was 86.818. The extent Of stoPinR grounci lai open on the 31st of December last was 1063,07 square fathoms. On the 31st of De. cember, 185, it was 988&27 -squr fathomns.

LAW BEPORT. COURT OF O.UlJS BELNCH W=mrmp- .TTrmp iQ9 AMBL V. ROOK WIeforc Mr. Justice WIa7TrsAx and Specoi Jurie.) The further heawing of thia case was resumed at tho sitti I of the Court, and the examination of the witnesses for theo defendant proceeded with, The first witness called was Elizabeth Ann Lawo, who said,-In 1851 I entered the service of the late Mr. Ambler, and remained there two years and six months. When I left Rock and his wife were o living in the cottage. They had nothing to do with'myl leaving. I did so at my own wish. Mr. and Mrs. Amabler did not live happily together. I recollect Mfr. Rock's two brothers, John and Tom. Mr. Ambler appeared very fond of them. He treated Rock and his wife as ser'its,:and Shey' paid him the respect due to a master. As long as I was in 'cis senvice he never appeared incapacitated from business. He v/as a very determined man, and could not bear contradiction. None of his relatives ever visited him while I was there. Mrs. Ambler's brother and sister did. Cross-examined.-I am not now In a situation, aor have I been for some time. I knew Mr. and Mrs. Rock from hav'im lived in the Fame house, and have often seen them since. 1 left before Mrs. Ambler died. I never saw Mr. Rock very violent to Mrs. Ambler. I never sew Mr. Rock the worse for liquor. Mr. Ambler's sister-in-law hired me. MIr. Edward John Dvis said,-I am a bay saleeman in Smithfield. I knew Mr. Ambler from 1846 to 1854 He dealt with me. The last time I saw him was in 1854. On one or two occasions I saw the little boy with him. He told me it was not his intention to leave his property to any of his family; he should leave it to the little boys. They were with him at the time. Ho said his family had behavod badly. This was after the death of his wife. Up to the last time I saw him he was perfectly clear in matters of businews. He was in bad health, but in mental capacity as sound as ever. He was n man not likely to be influenced. Cross-exan,ined.-The last titse I saw bim was eomewhere about June or July, 185 Ithink the conversation I have mentioned took place in the market. James N. Dixon said,-I am a clerk in the house of Sir C. Price and Co., bankers. Mr. Ambler kept his account there. One day in Marcb, 1854, he came to the bank with the boy to give him authority to sign checks for hir. I drew out an authority, and he signed it in my presence. .1 told him I supposed he was aware that thisauthority would give the boy full control over his funds whatever the amount might be. He said he was fully aware of it. I saw nothing about him indicative of weakness of mind. [T4e authority was put in.] Mr. Edward Rogers said-I am a clerk in the house of Sir Cbarles Price and Co. I knew Mr. B. Ambler. About the 7th or 8th of March, 1854, Thomas Rock called on me and sid Mr. Ambler wished to see me. I went to bis house at High. bury. He spoke of my brother, who had just died, and gave me a check for the balance at the bank, which he wished to make me a present of. The amount was 270& 13s. 3d. He said he did not know whether he should be able to write, but he took his checkbook and did write it. He sent dowh the next day to the bank to know whether the check had beencashed. On the 13th of March he camo down aboit giving the authority to the boy. On neither of these occasions did I observe the slightest want orcapacity on his part. He appeared shrewd, intelligent, and determined. Cross-examined.-He was in bed on the 8th of March, He complained of a pain in the hip, but rose up in the bed hearty and stron~. I never siw him at bis house but on tbat occasion. He satd he had never received such civility and attention as from mny. brother, and therefore gave me the check. I considered it a proof of his ahrewdness and intelli. gence. (Laughter.) Re-examised.-My brother had been the means of savlng him a large sum ot money by warning him against taking sbares in a bubble companv. Mr. Pelly.-I am a bAhder at Holloway. I lived next Mr. Ambler. I knew him for about 14 years. I was con stantly in the habit of seeing and conversing with hinj. The last time I saw him was in October or NovembeT, 1854. He sent for me about putting some Chubbe' locks on bis doors. He said be was gettin a new servant, and. as he was not able to go about himself, he did not like to have her prying into things. I remained with bim about half.an. bour. I never saw the slightest appearance of any diffe. rence in his mental capacity. He was then as keen as ever I saw him. He was a very determined men. He often spoke to me about his relations. He told me that some of his relations had been trying to see him, but that he did not want to havo anything to do with them, and would tell Rock to shut the door against them. I was there two or three times while he was sick. Young Rock was alwaya with him. He said, " There is the boy I intend to leave mny money to.'" Crcss-examined.-I saw him in November-I think as late as the 20th. I cannot undertake to say I saw bim on the 14th. I never knew Mr. Rock except as a servant. Mr. and Mrs. Rock were in and out of the room. There was also a female servant. Mr. Crespin.-I am a wine merchant at Islington. I knew Mr. Ambler, and was in the habit of seeing him two or three times a-week. The Last time-was in march, 1854 IHe was a man of great natural intelligence. He apneared much attached to the boys. They were constantly nwth him. I never noticed any chan e in him. Mr. Gregg, a baker, in 1Iolloway, had known Mr. Ambler for about 12 years. and saw him for the last time 10 months before he died. He was then in bed. The boy was in the room. Mfr. Ambler said that was his boyto have th, money. The conversation was about railways and stook jobbing. Rook and the boy were in the room the whole time. Mr. Ambler was a very shrewd man of business, and never exhibited any indication of -weakness of mind. Cross.examined.-The conversation lated abouta quarter of an hour, and included a variety of topics. Mr. Ambler talked a good deaL. Ho never mentioned that he had got * good portion of his property from his own family. Mr. Charles Turner, a farmer, at Croucb-end, had known Mr. Ambler for 13 years. and saw hima for the last time about a fortnight before his death, and he then appeared the same as ever. He said some one of his relations had been there and asl:ed if his affairs were settled, and that that was quite enounh for him. He was a shrewd and in. telligent man of businese. Cross-exsnined.-I was not aware whether any medical man was in attendance. The Rocks were the only persons I saw. I remained for four or five hours, and took tea, as I had done four or five times during Mr. Ambler's last illness, I did not see him after the lat time. (IlIr. T. hnihtley.-I am a plumberand painter. I rented a house in New Inn-yard from Mr. Ambler, and afterwards collected the rents of his property. I saw him about a month before his death.

He Faid he would willingly renew it to him. I had never seen Mr. Ambler before. He appeared to be a shrewd, intelli. gent man of business, perfectly well aware of what he was about. The lease was afterwards executed. Cross.exanlined.-I was there about a quarter of an hour. Mr. Wall, hairdresser at Holloway, examined, sid-I kew Mr. Ambler for mnany year.

I sometimes bed to wait till he awoke. s CrOss-exmined.-j noticed this aberration in his first iUness in March, 1854. I do not know that ho was then completely out of his senses for some days. The aberration was not so great in November and December as in March. There was no weakness of mind except in dreaming moments. I mean he talked as if he was dreaming. 1 observed it was less towards the end. I generally remained in his room from ae. qrter to half an hour. Zotu -examined.-It has often occurred to myself that when I woke up I did not know oxactly wbere I was. Mr. John Welch had known Mr. Ambler for two or three years, and saw bim in February, 1855, in reference to painting the outside of his house. There was not the slightest alteration then observable in him. Mr. Esquire Jukes said,-I had known Mr. Ambler for several years. I called on him in January, 1855. There did niotthen appear to be the slightestalteration in his capacity. He pointea tor hrs. Rock and said, "There is the good creature wvho takes care of me." I asked him how he managed about his houses and banking accoant; he pointed to the boy and said he signed all his checks for him. On one occasion I told him I had seen one of his nephews; he desired me not to mention the name, as he had fallen out withhis relations, The boy was in the room; he said he Cross-examined.-I do not recollect having Eeen him in NOvebr Charles Eorner aaid,-I am a cabinet-maker.

I attended Mr. Ambler from Fehruary, 1855, to has death. I had before attended him in 1852. When I was called in, in February, 1855, he was suffering great pain, his legs w ere much swollen, and he was unable to movethem. I certilied that the cause of -his death was chronic rheumatism and paralys. I paid bim 18 vWisits mnt his last llness. He generally kept me fora little time talk. img about the Xnoney-market and Parlamentary aff He al ays had the newspaper. Ustil two or three days before his death I never noticed any want of mental capacity. I never saw any persons ],ore attentive than the Rocks were to him. - One morning, when I was alone with him, I asked him it he did not wish to see some ofhisreations. He s3id certainly not-that he was sufficently attended to. He answered in a very perenmptory an eemndmanner. He began to sink about three days bUeforehis eath. Up to that he was capable of any ttrqiigtogt memory, and understanding. thogSt, Cross.examined.-I began to attend him on the 28th of February. I never spoke to him on any specific matter of business. I would have had no objection to transact busi- ness with him. I judged from his conversation. I never ' saw any symptoms to direct myattention to his mind.

TsHaCIG3u said he would not detain the Court by reading the ils, but he wished it to be distinctly understood that the cancelled wil of Murch, 1854, was word for wordl the same as that of November. This closed the case for the defendant.

COURT OF COMIMON PLEAS, WEsTz2;sTM JTUE 19. 1RAY V CThrTRAq tWCnga at Nifi Priua, bWforn Mfr. Justice CRowox1z Ca a Spec ia Juiw.) This was an action to recover damages for falsely reuresentint that the expenses of acertain chapel caled Vert;m Ohapel were only 601 a-year, in consequence of which representation the plaintiff was induced to take an assignaent of the lease thereof from the defendant, paying him for the eame 1001. by two bills of exchange, whereas the expense amounted to a much Iager sum, as the defendant weU knew, in consequence of which the plaintiff derived no profit, and suffered loss frorm the payment of rent and repairs to which he became liable. Mr. Se eant Ballant.'ne, Mr. Holl, and Mr. G. B. Hugbas appead for the plaintiff, and Mz. X Chambers, Q.C., and blr. Hone,man for the defendant. The plalntiff, it *ppeared, isa Nonconformistm ster, and the defendantwas censed ninisterof Verulam Episcopalian Cbapel, Maida-hill, and lecturer at St. Peter's, CornhijlL In December, 1865, the defendant was desirous of disposing of the chapel, of which he was lessee, and he in consequence caused an advertisement to be inserted in 27i TImes advertising the chapel to let. There was some difficulty in letMing the chapel to a minister of the Established Church, because the Bishop of Winchester had refused a liven , to Dr. Thompson. After the advertisement the plaintiff"ap. plied to the defendant, and entered Into a contract With him respecting the chapel, and accepted two bills for 105L, which sum was to be given for the chapel lease, in conside. ration of a considerable sum expended in repairs of the cbapel by the defendant. According to the paIntiff's state. snet in the witness-box these bills were to be placed in the hands of a friend for security, and were not -to be pressed for payment. The plaintiff saw Mr. Bridger, the chapel. warden, who told him the defendant merely wanted tbe money to get a cabinet of coins out of a broker's hands, and a friend would negotiate the matter for him It was represented to him by the defendant that the ex- uenses of the chapel were about 601. This statement mis. ed him, and induced him to take the chapel. He took possesion on the 17th of February, 1856. A Sunday or two afterwards he found that the cbapel had not been paying its expenses, and he wrote to the defendant respecting it. Various letters were put in evidence on the subject. He made inquiries of other e ns respecting it. He had been sued on the bills he had given, which had been discounted by Mr. Gibbs, and judgment had been obtainedagainst him. Mr. Christmas told him he woulduse his influenceto secore the continuance of the conFegation to him; but for that assurance he would have had nothing to do with the affair as the continuance of the congregation materially affected the pew rents. At that time th defendant asked him if he bad an,y objection to the church prayers He (the plaintiff) said, I None whatever; he rather liked a liturgy.' The de fendant said, " If you use the church prayers you will keep the congregation." He said, "You are a Dissenter who does not dissent-a Nonconformist who conforms." The defendant further sid, " The grand thing there will be to preach the gospel and read the prayers in order to keep the congregation." He expected to derive an income of 401. a. year fromit He only differedonEp ' -y from theChureb The expectation of an income of 401. a-year was his inducement to take the chapeL The receipts had not, however, equalled his expectation, and from an examination of the books of the chapel he lad since ascertained that the expenses were much more than 601. a-year. The expenses for the four years prior to his taking the assignment of the lease varied from 901. to 1051 a-year. Witnesses were called to confirm this statement, and also to prove that the defendant had always said he got nothing for his services at the chapel. On the part of the defendant the defendant proved that he bad told the plaintiff when entering into the agreement with him that the chapel had considerably fallen off in its revenue of late years, but that he thought it night be depended upon to produce 401. a-year. He told him that the income was decreasng, and that he did not consider it expedient to remain any loneer the minister. He pd a curate 201. a-year to do the duty for him, which he toldthe plaintiff he would not require, and he also speke to him about the Sacrament money, which amounted to about 301. a-year, and which he himself felt bound to give to the poor; and he told theolaintiff, as he was a Nonconformist, there would be no oblgation on him so to esend this sum, but he might apply this sum towards a incoine of the chapel. He bimself lost about 101. a-year by the chapeL This, sum deducted from the amount of the Sacrament money and what he paid bis curate left an income of about 401. a-year. He referred the plaintiff to Mr. Goodwin, the sexton, and to Mr. Corbet, the chapel warden, for the particulars of the income and expenditure, and agreed to give him an approximate estimate himself. He did not know the particular items, as he left it to his chapel wardens to keep the books. He told him be believedthe expenses were about 601. a-year, as he had heard from the chapel wardens, and he believed that he accurately represented to the plaintiff the income and expenditure. This evidence was confirmed by Mr. Bridger, and by Mr. Reed and Mr. Grady, chapel wardens, who stated that the defendant never saw the books, but left the keeping of the accounts to them, and they bad frequently told him the expenEes of the chapel, besides the rent of 120I, were about 601 a-year. The income was formerly about 1264, and -was considerably more than 40& The plaintiff was again caUed to contradict this evidence, and swore that the defendant never referred him to either Mr. Goodwin or Mr. Corbet, but on the contrary urged him to be very private about the negotiation, as he was fear. uld of the bishop censuring him for introducing a Nonconformist to the chapel, as the lease was not expired. En consequence, therefore, he did not speak to any one about it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The learned counsel having respectively addressed the jury on behalS of their clients, Ilis LoRDSsIP summed up, and directed the jury that the inducement to the plaintiff was not, according to the evidence, the atatement that the expenses of the chapel were 601., but the expectation of making 401. a-year by it. The main question for them to consider was whether, when the defendant made the statement, which was unquestionably incorrect, about the 60I, he believed that the account he was giving was a correct one. If they thought he did so believe they must find for the defendant; if they believed that ho knowingly mado that erroneous statement to deceive the p lainuiffthey must iind for the plaintift The jury were of opinion that when the defendant made the statement about the 60. to the plaintiff he believed it to be trule, and that there was no intention to defraud His LoRDsui..-That makes an end of the case. There is no necessity to put the other question. Verdict for the defendant. This caseoccupied the whole day until 7 o'clock.

Lewis appeared for the plIntiff* Serjeant Hayes and Mr. B, Clark represented the defendants. The action was brought to recover damages alleged to be sustained by the negligence of the defendants in not taking sufficient care of a model exhibited in the Crystal Palace. It apeared by the evidence of Mr. Fiz, the agent of the plaintiff, that in April of last year he ned offered a larpe model of Cronstadt, which had been publicly exhibited in liccadilly and elsewhere, to the Crystal Palcce Compan for sale. The company declined to purchase the model, but consented that it should be exhibited in the Crystal Palace, and it was accordingly sent there, and placed in the model gallery. Several witnesses were called on behalf of the plaintiff, who had inepected the model a few days before the trial, and who gave testimony that the wooden frame or table upon which the town and fortifications were modelled in plaster had warped, ald the model had become cracked and damaged. It was alleged on be- alf of the plantiff tbat the mischief was occasioned by the mode' being exueed to the sun. On the other hand, Mr. Fergnson, the general manager of the company, deposed that before the model wrs sent he had stated, to Mr. Fiz that it would be necessary that it.should be protected by a- Blass case and, as ne .,nch case was sent with it, the com, .mhad as aUSUP047 rrangeu4ent.

MALT V. THE SUF, WALS RALWAY COMPANY. This was an actionL 4gainst the defendantB for negligenoo as carriers in the riage of a box and tierce. The defendants, among other pleas, pleaded that the box and tieroe were part of the cargo of a vessel called the SanPars, wrecked on the coast of Wales, i3d which cargo was plandered, and the said goods stolen were not the property of the plaintiff, nor had he at any time any right to the posession of the goods asagainat the owners of the cargo, and after the goods were delivered to the defendants, and while they were in their cutody. the said goods were seized and takenaway by the true owners of the soods, who had the right to the possession of the goods as against the plaintif¢ andacs against the. defendants.

A master was bound to furnish his men with proper materials to work with, and was then not responsible if any accident happened to one of many of them engaged in the same employment. The question here was whether they believed the defendant had given any injudicious and improper order. If they thought he had, ihen they must give compensation to the plaintiff for his sufferings, for his loss of wages, and for his loss of ability to earn henceforth the same amount of wages. He did not think, however, that the case called foi heavy or vindictive damages. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, The Court rose at 3 o'clock.

Some part of her head-dress fluttering over the flames, it ignited, and in one moment she was wrapped ina blaze. A gentleman bebind her, with admirable presenoe of mind, tore off his ooat and enveloped her completely, putting his hat on her head, where her hair was already on fire, andextinguished the flames. The whole scene was bebeld from Hyde Park, where a number of persons were collected looking at the illumiation fwhen the accident occurred. It is understoodthegentleman was Sir Edward Buiver Lytton.

LATEST INTELLI(EnE. THE ELECTIONS IN FRANRF. The Moniteur of yesterday publishes the loilawingl Address from the Prefeet of the Sebe to' the1 electore:- 8'Prefeocuro of the Department of tue Seine,-Eltious of the 21st cnd 22d of &tne. Electors of the Department of the Sdno,- You axn convoked to aominate your 'dequties to t,a Legislative body. "Tho days ars gou b'y w de ies re senting oy a privileged class of elctors %aoe Governmee feared pauHd7 to express its opildon an alectOks threwn open to the atugglos of parties and to the rivilry of ambitiom. IlTo day the Government, by tfrnkly'adopting universal sffrage, by exludingfron the lTegilativo 'bodg' every functionary paid by the State, wished that the Chamber should 'be the 'expression of the genemal wilL lthus'only reserved to itself 'one means of infiuence-nstnely, to proclaim cloud to the 'country the names of the mren who 'anjoy its coafidence, so 'that the people rneynot'be deceivd by falso declarations ,of politicalopinione. " To be enabled to govern,-theEnperor at3ndsdin need of an elective independentChanmber, but devoted tto his cause 4as also 'to'the newinstPiutions. With those deputies who have already shown Whattheyxoe the task qcf government will ho easy; withkieputies ofanother periedeand of another ,order of ideas you 'ran the riek of creating agitation and anxiety. Novw, believe it, agitation and anxiety are always 'detrimental to the workinag-an. "' Moreover, many of -the candidates of the Opposition, declared adversaries of the 1mperial Constitution, only seek your voteseto reject them with ostentation. -" The candidates which the Government points out to you in tine of the electorml districts of -the department of 'the Seine are the retiring members. While maintaining an honourable independenee they have, -on. every serious occasion, givea proof of resl patriotism. " For the new electo-al district, rendered necessary by -the increase of the population, the candidate proposed is an "ax-mayor, member of the municipal counoil of Paris, whose -devotion to the Govenmuent of the Emperor and to the interests of his fellow-citizens has never wavered. Like his colleagues he willbe a sureand eli&hteaed supporter. "I t is by the support of the great bodies of the State, and ,especially of that one which votes 'the laws that the Emperor has been able to get through five years, during which an infinite number of various calamities have, -so to say, disappeared under the brillianey of new glories and of new prosperities. It is owing to that support that the three Years of bad harvest were less disastrous in France than elsewhere; that gigantic works have transformed Paris and the whole of France . that agriculture, industry, and commerce have been pro: tooted and developed; that the Government was enabled to -commence an improvement-in the condition of the lesser officials; that-the conscription has been made lighter; that -the army, notwithstanding, has received a more solid -constitution.; that the institutions of benevolence and publc charity have been -increased; tlht certin taxes have already been reduced despite the expenses of the war; and, finally, that France has regained, by arms as welles by wisdom and policy, the rank which is her due in Europe. " The- question, therefore, stands clearly stated thus " To vote for the candidates designated by the Government is to ratify their conduct by your votes, to approve what they have already done, to facilitate the execution .of the grand projects of the Emperor. " To.vote, on the other hand, for the hostile candidates, is to enter- path without a goal with maen who, most of them, have really no -sympathy with the people; who, in the exercise of power, have already given proofs of their insufcienoy-and weakness, and who can only re-establish -their party on the misfortunes of their country. "'Yomr hoice cannot be doubtfuL "The Prefect of the Seine, " G. E. 1{AUSSMANN. "Hotel de Ville, Paris, June 19." The Montiteur subjoins a list of the candidates of Ahe Government.

SEAmEN'S 'WAGES. - The ports of the United 'States, even mnore than those of Great Britain, are infested with crimps and loafers, who systematically plunder seamen .by cashing. advance notes,-notes that become due after the vessel a seaman is. employed in has proceeded to sea To remedy this evil several prominent merchants in New York ;have agreed to abolish those. notes altogether after the 1st of Jucly, and they propose instead to supply warm clothing equal to one suit per, man for each ship under their control, wvich shall be - sold at the, first cost to the sailors. The -crimps -charge above. 50 per cent, advance on retail prices. They * also propose to pay a bounty of 10 per cent. on -the earned wages of e. ,or tho shalI perform the voyage to the end of the contract, or *return in the ship. If the ship is lost every seaman to be paid to the time of his loss, in no oase less than onemonth aon foreignrand one balf month on coastwise voyages. These conditions are to be afdixed to the sbipping articles. It will be Eeen from- the above that the New York merchants are following the 'excellent example set by the Board of Trade in this coantry, in encouraging provident and orderly habits niiong seamen. There is no doubt that, co-extensive with -the progress of' the mercantile marine of Great Britain and the UJnited States, a progress so rapid in recent times as te *cause the supply of seamen to be short of the demand in both countries, a fearful amount of evil has been created among tbeseamen, and great loss bas been occasioned to the owners of shipping property tbrough the crimping sys-tem. The money-order offices and savings-banks for seamen, recently originated by the Board of I'rade, are doing mach to domesticate-the seamen employed in long voyages and 'to keep ahve an attachment to home; and no doubt if OUt shipowners were to think more of seamen as men, And less -,of them as ehattels, and support the Board of Trade in putting down -the crimping system in a manner such & that exhibited' by the New York merchants, we ahotld have 'zore real domestic comfort on board ship, and it is to he boptd fewer of sueh- outrages ' as those reported to havw occurred on board' the'Mary, and 'Jane, of Sunderland. Al +he present time, notwithstanding the great efforts madc by the Bard of'Tade andtbe local marine boards of thiu countiy to put an esd to crimping, scarcely a seatide oceun .Gn the Tyne, 'Wear, or any-of 'the other large exporting ,orts, without large vessels, that are about to proceed on onS foreign voy esa being detained for hours off the bars ztnil portions o-the crew, who have hcad their advanci .motes cashed by orimps, .are brought off in boats by the river I olice, drunk.

EBB6 RAIDRL* FESTITAL Al' THE - O1RYSTAL PALA CE. Yeity'Witneswed the last of thesegr.tmraacel' commemorations, though in point -of attendance, 1p-endour, and Bucess, it might well be called the fiSt. Snich of the visitorsas only attended on0 Mondcay r during the occasion of the Royal visit can form but an inadequate notion of the impressive scene which the interior of the Palace presented. Every seat from which one could hear or see, and many from which it was difficult to do either, had its occupants, and, notwrithstanding the immense accommodation provided, some hundreds of vnsitors were forced to content themselves with promenading the nave and surveying from a distance the massive thousands which rank in rank filled every portion of the central space. Not since the gr.at day when Her Majesty and the Emperor of the French paid a State visit to Norwood have the roads presented such an appearance. From Duiwich, Sydenham,ancd Vauxhall the stream of carriages was incessant, and as each separate avenue poured its tide of vehiclea into the one general road up to the building the numbers became almost unmanageable. The interminable hill which leads to the Downs on a Derby-day is considered as affording an unique spectacle in this respect, but yesterday it was for a time quite outdone, and it wil probably be iong ere the public again witness such an assemblage of carriages as during the morning thronged through the Dluiwich road. The usual amount of waiting and annoyance was met with at the turnpike (to amend which some strong-minded mtetropolitan "Rebecca" is devoutly wished for), which led to such, delay that even up to the time when the oratorio had commenced the visitors were flocking in continually. As this little bar has now become a great nuisance, and one of which visitors are continually complaining, we are requested to state that the directors of the Palace have been at considerable expense to construct a road expressly to save passing through this insatiable obsatcle. On this road no tolls are levied, the dust is laid, and the access to the Palace altogether easier and more pleasant. Such of the visitors as were aware of this convenience yesterday profited by it to the extent of arriving three-quarters of an hour before those who adhered to the old route up the hilL Neasly 10,000 visitors came down to the Palace by raiL The arrangements at the station were most excellent, and as fast as the visitors arrived they were accommodated in the trains without hurry or confusion. It would be in vain to attempt a description of the interior of the Palace. A vast multitude is at all times a grand and moving spectacle; but when the concourse is assembled and ranged in such a building as the Crystal Palace, motionless and almost breathless, listening with intent anxiety to solemn hymns poured forth by two thousand voices, the effect is too great for description. Such was, in truth, the case yesterday, when, at the commencement of the second part of the oratorio, more than 17,000 visitors were seated before the orchestra, which at a distance seemed to rise like some colossal bouquet from out of the garden of colours which spread around it. The heat was excessive, and to look down upon the great parterre where, at least, 5,000 forms were m perpetual motion, gave to the whole concourse an aspect of noiseless activity which was singular in the extreme. Everything, in fact, was on &gigantic scale; the rising of the audience between the first and second parts made a noise like the rush of a mighty wind, and the reverberating applause of 30,000 hands was in its way as well worth hearing as the orchestra. Messrs. eigretti and Zaunbra were again busy in the pper alleries, and made a most successful attempt to photograph the whole orchestra on a large scale, and so perfectly was this difficult feat achieved that even the individual likenesses of each performer can be found. As on the previous occasions, the management of the refresument department was admirable. The new plan of sending round refreshments between the parts has answered even better than was anticipated, and it would almost startle the visitors of yesterday to be informed of the awful amount of biscuits, sherry, and ices which they consumed. Between 8,000 and 9,000 luncheons and dinners were furnished during the day. Bat for the much increased counter-space which wts allowed to Mr. Staples this most important portion of the festival proceedings would have been a sad blot upon their general success. Itwould be ungraciouson our part were we to conclude our notice of these great fites without bearing testimony to the courtesy, civility, and attention of all connected with their management. Both to those who represented the Sacred Harmonic Society and the immediate members of the Crystal Palace staff the highest praise is dte. Never have festivals of such magnitude, and of which all the arrangementv were of so novel and almost experimental a character, been conducted with more thorough order, propriety, and actual comfort to the spectators. In the enumeration of those who have rendered essential service Mr. Ferguson, the able manager of the Palace, of course stands fist, and to him, and to Mr. Grove, the secretary, every lover of music is deeply indebted, for the months of toil. and often extreme discouragement,which they had to undergo before such triumphant results as those of the past week were achieved. What we have said of these gentlemen may, as far as zeal and assiduity in their various departments is concerned, be said of the entire staff connected with the building. From first to last they have never fagged or faltered in efforts to promote the general success of the arrangements, and so far contribute to the individual convenience of each visitor. None of our readers will require to be informod of the perfect nature of the po ice arrangements both within and without the building, or of the civility with which the constables performed their often diflicult duty. The vigilance and constant care of Superintendents Martin and Lund in this respect is worthy of every commendation. Israel in Egypt more than realized the flattering anticipations entertained of its success. Although musicins have ever regarded this oratorio (the fifth produced in England) as Handel's choral masterpiece-although Mendelssohn himself pronounced it " the greatest and most lasting pie¢e" of its immortal eomposer-owing to various reasons it has hitherto failed to obtain that complete hold of the public affections which its companion the Messiah has enjoyed for a century, and which has even been accorded to two works that are not Handel's-the Creation by Haydn and the Elijah by Mendelasohn. During the lifetime of Handel it was the least popular of his works, and waS never performed without curtailiDg the choruses anddinterpolating airs for the principal singers, in order to accommodate the half-educated taste of the day, which could not tolerate that sustained level of sublimity beneath which Israel in Egypt never once descends. These curtailments and interpolations a3most passed into tradition, and it remained for the better appreciation of after times to discard them and to restore this most wonderful inspiration to the form in which it originally came from the pen of the composer. Since its restoration it has been gradually but surely working its way, and we believe the time is not very far distant when Israel in Egypt will occupy the place to which it is entitled, not only m the estimation of connoisseurs but ia popular regard, by the side of its only possible compeer, the Messiah, to compare it with which would be unjust, since the two have nothing whatever in commoa but their unparalleled musical excellence. Yesterday, at the Crystal Palace, IZwad in 4gypt was given just ax HAndel wrote and as Handel would bave loved to hear it. To describe such a performance is not an easy taslk, since aS everything calls for eulogy, the danger of exhaust- ing the vocabulary of prise becomes imminen,, and a column flled with laudatorv epithets wouMd suggest rather an idea of romance tban -of reality. It is nevertheless true that the execution of Isri.Wl in EByp1t in the Crystal Palace yesterday surpassed in sustained excellence that of the Messiah on Monday, and of Judas Macmb(aus on Wednes- day, wh&eb, as the diffieulties it presents ae so much greater, argued a diligence on the part of the singers zad a determination on that of the eoDd actor which cannot be too highly comme mIe& The principal interest attached to this oratorio, as evemy one knows, is concentered in tliz choruses, which for such a celebration as the Handel Festival rendezed it of all works the fittest. The iirst part contains no less thau eleven choruries, with ntothing [but a conjtralto air, " ' Their land brought forth frogs" (which Hatudel would, there is little doubt, have also set for the choir but for the unsuggeative character of the words), a ud two or three recitatives to relieve them. Ihe seond part cgQtAius an many chorses, but with more- work for the principal .mu%erhsisince, besides some recitatives, there are I ree am nd as many duets. It is a curious fact that the second part of the oratorio was wvritten first, ancd that the othei was an afterthought. I laving made Moses and the children of Israel I exult in theirescape from Egyptian thraldom, dilate on the miracles through which it was accomplished, and oflbr up hymns of praise and thanksgiving to Ithe Amiggty, the propriety of describing the miwales themselves appears to have arien in the mind of Handel; and to this we owe the composition of Xaodtu, which, prefixed to the Song of Motes, now constitutes the oratorio of Israd in Egypt. The first chorus, " And the chiUdren of Israel sighed by reason of their bondage," where Haudel has shown himself as grand a master of pathos as of the elaborations of counterpoint, was a foretaste of what was to come. The conviction that there would be a performance of unaccustomed excellence cprung at once from this beginning, and was fully warranted by the result. "1 They loathed to drink of the river; He turned their waters into blood"-the first of that unexampled chain of choruses by which the plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians, the miracle of the exodus, the destruction of Pharaoh's host, and the religious awe created in the minds of the favoured people, are illustrated-was delivered. with an accuracy and truth of intonation the more remarkable since the theme is composed of awkward intervals, chromatic in dtyle and treated throughout in the strictest and severestform of fugue. The impression produced by this most suggestive "tone-picture' was deepened by that of the next, "He spake the word," which embodies the plagoue of the flies, the lice, and the locusts-one of &e double-choruses for which Israel int Egypt is renowned-a composition of a very different character from its predecessors, but equally distinguished by desciptive eloquence. At the end of this fine piece the audience broke forth in loud applauee, which, after the terminatien of the succeeding chorus, " He gave them hailatones," was renewled in a manner so universal and tumultuous that, notwithstanding Air. Costa's disinchnation to "encores," he was compelled to yield to the desire of the audience. We cannot remember on any occasion so grand a performance of this marvellous piece, which, as a combination of simplicity and power, is wholly without a paralleL The two next choruses, in which the plaguie of darkness and the destruction of the first-born are embodied, were, from another point of view, quite as impressive. In the first, remarkable for its daring and singular progressions of harmony, we were once more delighted at the purity of intonation displayed by such a multitude of voices, and were not less pleased to observe that the exaggerated reading of the last phrase-." even darkness, which might be felt "-complained of at rehearsal, though not entirely discarded, was considerably modified. Passing over the intervening pieces, we came to the prodigiously fine chorus, in three parts, commencing with "He rebuked the Red Sea." Here the grandeur of the opening, which illustrates the Divine decree, was most admirably contrasted with the passage by which its accomplishment is so forcibly conveyed-" and it was dried up "-deliyered in an undertone than which nothing could be more expressive. The basses gave out the slow and measured theme of "He led them through the deep" with tremendous effect; and no words cau suggest a notion of the effect produced by the magnificent climax, " But the waters overwhelmedptheir enemies," where Handel, putting forth all his might to give significance to the catastrophe that involved the persecutors of Israel in annihilation, has succeeded In presenting a musical picture of unequalled greatness and sublimity. The reiteration of the worda " Not one,"-in the sentence " there was not one of them left'-was literally appalling. The second part was in all respects as satisfactory as the first, but we cannot attempt anything like a detailed account. Chorus after chorus was admirably delivered, and each succeeding piece seemed to efface the triumph of that which had gone before. The justly famous "Horse and his rider," with which the Swig of Moses begins and endsan apostrophe to the Omnipotent power that has redeemed the children of Israel from their oppressors, set to music worthy if possible of the theme; " The depths have covered them," where occs that remarkably impresive pamage for the basses on the words-" They sank into the bottom as a stone ;" "Thy light hand, 0 Lord," a manifestation of jubilant triumph unsurpassed in the music of the choir; and, beyond all, those wonderful compositions, " With the blast of thy nostrils" and " The people shall hear," where the genius of Handel soars into the loftiest regions of the sublime, and his musical knovrledge is displayed with a masterly ingenuity that can scarcely be paralleled elsewhere, even in his own works, were, one and all, executed by this immense assemblage of singers and players in such a manner as to render the critic's office a sinecure. There was no hesitation, no shirking of difficulties, no false or wavoring intonation; all wa frank, straightforward, and effective singing. The sympathies of the audience were excited to an extraordinary pitch. The "Horse and his rider" was re-demanded bythousands of voices; but Mr. Costa, aware thatthis chorus comes again, was this time resolute, and proceeded with the duet, " The Lord is my strength," heedless of the obstreperous demand for a repetition. When, at the end of the oratorio, it was repeated in its proper place, the effect was just as striking, and doubtless all the more so from the judicious decision of the conductor in the first instance. A more triunphant conclusion to a performance of uniform and well-sustained exceUence could not have been desired. Never did a body of English choristers (and so vasta bodywas never beforeumted) attain more honourable distinction. The principal solo singers were again successful; and once more Mr. Sims Reeves was the hero. He had not nearly so arduous a task in Israel as in Judas Maccabmeus; but of the one air which affords occasion for the exhibition of vocal facility and skill he availed himself with surprising talent. His execution of this very difficult song, which abouads in florid divibions after Handel's peculiar maaner, was masterly throughout, the declaination being just as powerful as the vocal enunciation of the notes was irreproachable. The audience, roused into enthusiasm, would not be denied; and so unanimously expressed was their desire to hear the song again that there was no resisting it. Thus another encore was added to the incidents of the day. Miss Dolby sang both the contralto airs to perfection, and made a profound sensation in the second-" Thou shalt bring them in." Not less happy was Madame Novello in " Thou didst blow with thy wind," which was very finely given, and but for the misfortune of coming immediately after Mr. Sims Reeves in " The enemy said " would have produced a still greater effect. Where Madame Novello was most applauded by the audience was in the recitatives of Mfiriam the Prophete;s, " Sing ye to the Lord," &c., preceding the final chorus, where, while we admired the clear and penetratingr quality of her upper tones, we could not approve her alteration of the text of HandeL The spirited and always telling duet for basses, " The Lord is a man of war," sung with remarkable power by Herr Formee anda r. Weiss, and, as usual, one of the great features of the performance, was received with the loudest applause. After the oratorio the National Anthem was given, Madame Novello again being intrusted with the principal solo verses. The Handel Festival, judged from a musical point of view, has been an unquestionable success. It was a bold experiment; but the result has proved that musical performances on a very grand scale are possible in the Crystal Palace. Of course, experience must be bought, and the experience acquired by this first trial will be of no little value in any future undertaking of the saine kind. The committee of the Sacred Harmonic Society have earned laurels of a novel kind, and may fairly regard the projection and accomplishment of so extraordinary an enterprise with pride, as the most striking and memorable incident in the history of their institution, which, in the course of 25 years, from a small and insignificant knot of amateurs, has grown into a body sufficiently important to project, and sufficiently strong to carry out an enterprise of such unprecedented magnitude. How muchl they owe to their accomplished conductor, Mr. Costa-whose exertions duriug the progress of the Handel Festival have been as inremitting as his musical services have been invaluable-.we need not insist. The cbeers, acclamations, and wavinD of hats that greeted him from all sides yesterday on retiring from the orchestra were tokens of how entirely hi3 eff ts ha b~een appreciated by the public.
MTITARY AND NA-AL INTBLLI.GBOE.- The Duke of Cambridge, ua General Commanding in Cbief, beld a levee yesterday afternoon at the orin Guards, when there was a numerous attendance of ofieers. The foUowing dep6ts at the Provisional Battalion, Chat. ham, will furnish nearly 2,000 n1ono-ommissioned officers and men for the head-quarters of their corps servg in India, the whole of whom have received orders to hold themielves in readiness for embarcation, viz. :-8th (the King's), 10th, 24th, 27th (Enniskillens), 29th, 32d, 35thj (Royal Sussex), 43d (Lght Infantry), 524 (Light Infantry). , 53d, 60th Rifles (lst Battalion), 61st, 64tb, 70th, 74th (Highlanders), 75th, 78th (Highlanders), 81st, 83d, 84th, 86th, and 87th (Royal Irish Fusileers). The officers and men selected for embarcation bave gone through a course of :nstruction in the Enfield rifle, and have also been taught escalading by the officers of the Royal Engineers. On Wednesday portions of two regiments enabarked at Kingstown for foreign service. The first of these detachments, consisting of the head-quarters of the 77th Regiment, some companies of which had set sail for Australia on the previous day in the Palmerston transport, went on board the Orwell, and was composed s8 follows .-30 sergeants, 16 drommers, 17 corporas, and 357 privates, under the follow' ing officers:-Lieutenaut-Colonel R. J. Straton, C.B.; Major the Hon. A. G. C. Chichester, Captains R. B. Wil. lington, F.L Butts, W. N. xL Orpen; Lieutenants R. IL ,. Colquhan, G. E. Leggett, T. P. Harvey, M. A. Waters, H. IL F. Brown, C. B. Knowles, P. S. Dauncey, H. iL Bengough, F. D. Mant, . S. Baker; EnsiRns J. Wordsworth, P. Kirk; PaymasterW. F. Scott, Adjutant H. R Hill, Quartermaster H. Blisset, Assistant-Surgeon A. Humfiles. 47 women and 40 children accompanied the detach. maent. The Orwell is a fne vessel of 1,220 tons register but of at least 1,500 tons actual burden. The second detachment consisted of portion of the 95th Regiment, which embarked in the Polonaise for the Cape of Good Hope. The Beechoroft is on her way from Cork to lingstown, where she is hourly expected to take on board the head. quarters, &c., of the 95th Regiment; she has been detdned by contrary winds. The whole of the ofricers, non-commissioned officers, and gunners off duty, forming the Royal Artillery garrison at Woolwicb, wer on Thursday drawn up in three battalions on the garrison parade, under the chief command of Lieute. nant-Colonel G. R. Barker, C.B., at 2 p.m., and were divided into three battalions-the st battalion in commd of Lieutenant-Colonel Faddy, the 2d in command of Lieutenant-Colonel Montresor, and the 3d in command of Lieutenant-Colo nel Travers-and were marched to Wool. wich Common for the purpose of brigade drill and a periodical inspection of the corps. The proceedings were those of a general field-day, and were performed in a style satisfactory to the officers in command, who expressed their atisfaction to the non-commissioned officers. The Royal Horse Artillery, dismounted, were likewise marched to Woolwich Common, and were put through a course of foot parade and sword exercise, under the command of Cap. tain and Adjutant A. Motteux Calvert. The inspection is to be continued to-day (Friday), when 10 rounds of ammunition are ordered to be distributed to eaoh man. The Lords of the Admiralty, in consideration of the long and meritorious service of Captain T. B. Pleydell, of the Chatham division of Royal Marine Light Infantry, have perm-itted that officer to retire from the service on full pay' with the honorary rank of major. Her Majesty's yacht Victoria and Albert, Captain the Hon. Joseph Denman, left Jersey on Monday morning last and anchored early on the following day at Glengariff; at the upper end of Bantry-bay, south-west coast of Ireland, having averaged 15 knots across, notwithsanding a heavy sea. The captain and officers having spent a few hours among the beautiful scenery there, the yacht left *t3 o'clock for Queenstown, where she arrived the same evening at 9 o'clock. Nothing can exceed the satisfactory performanoeg of the Etate vessel. It was supposed she would leave for I&verpool on Tuesday evening. Rear-Admiral W. F. Martin struck his flag on board the St. Vincent in Portsmouthharbour at sunset on Wednesday and went on leave. The Princess Charlotte, 104, batrckehip for China, Cap. tain King, C.B., left Portsmouth barbour yesterday morn. ing, and anchored at Spithead. She is laden with a great quanUtity of stores, &o., for the China fleet. The Niagara's alterations for stowing the great Atlantic telegraph cable will be completed at Portsmouth this day, and she will leave forthwith for Liverpool. One of her crew fell into her hold and was killed on Wednesday. An inquest waa held upon the body on board the Niagara by Mr. Cooper, tho coroner for the boroubh of Portsmouth, in the absence of Mr. Swainson, the Admiralty coroner, and a verdict of " Accidental Death" returned. The funeral took plce on Thursday, and was attended by the United States' Vice-Consul, Chevalier Pappalardo, four of the Niagar's boats with warrant officers, marines, and seamen, under charge of a lieutenant; the flagship Victory furnished a boat with the first-lieutenant of that ship and a party of seamen, who followed the body to the grave. Last nieht Chevalier Pappalardo entertained Captain Hudson andl the ward-room officers of the Niagara, the Port Admiral's staff, &c., at the United States' Consulate-house. The sailing-transport Goward, Captain Boueb, has been ordered to Woolwich, where she is embarking 58 tons of traversing platforms from the Military Store Departmeat for Mfalta. The freightship Euphrates is under orders to go to Woolwich from the Docks to ship ammunition for Algoa Bay. Her Majesty's paddle steamaloop Ardent ha been undocked at Woolwich, and hauled into basin to continue the necessary reir She is undergoing a thorough refit. The Bisho, of London h.s issued a notice to the effect that it his intention to hold a military confirmation in the Garrison Chapel at Woolwich on Monday, the 13th of July. The fine sailing ship Medina, belonging to Messrs. James Baines and Co., has been fitted at Liverpool for the conveyance of the head-quarters of the 50th Regiment, under Colonel Waddy, from Kingston for Colombo. Notices have been posted in the Underwrlters'-room, Liverpool inviting tenders for the conveyance of troops from Malta to Lherpoo, retuniing with exchange regiments. The new iron screw steamer Dalhousie, 1,500 tons burden, has sailed for Madras. This is the first of two fine steamers to leave our shores for India. They were selected by the Hon. East India Company for steam-transports, and were both built byIeuny and Rankin, of Dumbarton. The D)alhiousie, so called inhonour of the ex-Sovernor-General. is 230 feet in length, 302 feet in breadth, and 16A feet in depth of hold, steams 12 knots, and her consort is t5ie Prince Arthur. The launch of the Melpornene at Pembroke Dockyard is to take place on the 8th of August next. She is a screw frigate pierced for 50 guns, and has been adapted from a 60-gun sailing frigate, for which she was originallv laid down. Having been cut in half, she has been lengthened to the extent of 32J feet in the midship section, and has received an additional length of 13 feet at the stern and 5i feet at the bows. She is about 240 feet in length, and ber beam will enable her to carry heavy ordnance. The construction of the new monster frigate, the Orlando, of 50 gans, is proceeding. Lieutenant G. S. Bosanquet was yesterday appointed to the Melville. By private letters which have been received at Chatham from officers on board the Harpy steamer, Commander G. A. Brine, it appears that that vesse; was still lying at the Piratus, Athens, where it was expected she would remain three months longer. At the date of the letters (June 10) the Earpy was expecting to go on a few weeks' cruise among the islands in the Archipelago. after which she would again return to Athens. The Duke and Duchess de Montpenrier, with the Prin. cesses, will shortly pay a visit to the ex-Queen of the French at Claremont.

SPOBTING I:NELLIGENCE. ThWAtA T tAVIW VACFlT ETnTUm The annul grand aiing match for iooners only came off yssterday.~ Thigs lgenenallr th ermost interesting match of the seam;n inumuch as it pros ente Most cope for the display of smat umaship, and to the mere spectator affords a very delightful excursion. Theweather yesterday was be%utiful in the extreme, although, from the crcumstance of the wind being right ahead the whole of the " down" race, that portion ofthe trip was rendered little tedious,while theconstant necessityfor heaving toonthe part of the attendant steamer was a sore trial to the patience, and astilaseverer ordealto the stomaohs, of those " faIr-weather -acks" (and they are many) who think on these occaoions to do the nautica, and to pass off as elder " ons of tbh, Thames," if not as Elder Broth ren of the Trinity House by dint of donning a pea-jackets and a gold.lcd hat, anl indnlgi'ng in a little innocent shipmasterSe slang. The Prince of Wdes (Margate) steamer was charteredfor the aecornmodation of the club, andstastedfrontheAdelaide.wharfpune. tually atlO o'clock. The deck of thisfinesteamerws crowded by a goodly oompany, the Ilite including the Commodore Of the Yacht Olub, Lora Alfred Psget, Count Batthyani Mr. Bramley-Moore, H.P., Mr. John Walter, H.P., Sir John Cathcart, and a number of naval gentlemen, amateur anI professionaL There was also a large asemblge of ladies. The two prizes-the first a splendid silver-gilt soup tureen and the second an elegant frosted silver ewer-were dis played in the saloon for the inscion of the visitor,. Gravesend was attained soon after 12 o'clock3, and from that port the following yachts duly startd, a sixth, the Pet (160 tons), of Plymouth, owend by Mr. Alfred Tooth, having been withdrawn at the last moment:- FIRST CLAkI. E3cxxnTiN 7I; rPnAq lcarer mlusw ssume per ton for difference of tonnave in ecch clas. The distance to be siled was from Gravesend round the Mouse Idght and back to Greenhithe,a distanee of nearly 60 miles, There was a very large stake of money depending upon the result. By Hunt's Un iversa Yacht List we find that the ZouDve wva built by lsey, and belongs to Grimsby; the May Fly by White, the Aquiline by Elrvey, the Wild. fire by Hanson, and the Vestal by Inman. It was the first time the Zouave had ever shown in the London river; she was spoke very highly of as having both pace and se worthy properties, and, it being found that she bad no other opponent than the May Fly, the betting would pro. bably have gone to fny extent upon her could takeis havebeen found. The Aquiline, a very pretty craft, was not at all in request, it being considered that the race must unquestionably lie between the Wildfire and the Vestal, and so it turned out. The latter had undergone sever,] improvements since she last appeared in a race of this club It was stoutly declared that she could run, reach, and beat waL The character given of her checked the advances of the Wildfire's friends, -who were disposed to back her at very large odds, which in many indances they did. The general cry is "If there had but been a little more wind In when the discomfitare of some over.sanguine owner or friend has been ocasioned by defeat; but there was ro reason for such exclamation yesterday. There was wind enough for anything, and so mucsh for those afloat that tbey had a reef in their mainsails. The wind was very strong nainly; from the east, although it varied slightly throughout the day, and this gave theyachts a dead foul wind down and a flowing sheet up. Lord Alfred Paget was the commauder for the day, assited by Mr. B. Green, the worthy vioe commodore, and at 0 h. 30 rin. 47 se. the signal was given for the start It was a very beautiful start, and elicited the ap. plauee of every beholder, The two larger boats had been moored a little below the others, and the picture that presentd itself ma the canvass win being set and they were swinging round was beautifuL The Aquiline first had her sails set and she was followed by the VestaL The Wildfire wsa sadly hampered at the very moment of starting byhaving.tobearup and go round avessel, which threw ner into the last place. taried were the opinions as to which really had the lead-a matter not very ellydiscovereduntil they went about. Although the May Fly had a capital sttion, ebe was unable from the first moment to keep pace with her more lively opponents, and fell so far astern that no farther notice of her is ne^es sary. The Aq uine led slightly, but soon their podtionn were atered, the Vestal shooting by her to windward, the Zonave beingthird,andtbeWildfirefourth. Soonthelastnamedbegan to mend, and off the Chapman, by dint of the most capitalsasling, their p tionswere alteredto Vestalfirst, Wildfire second, Zouave M , and next the Aquiline, the first named leading by a quarter of a mUe, Soon this moment the pet contest lay between the Vestal and the Wildfire, which were qualified by their for the first, instead of the second prize. It certainl{y'!wca one of the prettiest matches on record. Sometimes tho Wildfire looked ahead, but when they wero about she was stiL found astero. All that nautioal sldll could suggest was resorted to by botb, and at length, wvheawitin about four miles above the Mouse Iht, the wdfiherintothe first ple, in which orer they arrived at the distane-Xpost, the work ag ainst wvind and tide for the last half-hour being desperate.
