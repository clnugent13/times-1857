The aduilteration of ouir food has become so dangerous and universal as Practice, that the Legislature have deemed it necessary to inqutire searchingly into the socal evil by means of a; Commuittee of the Houtse of Comons whih ha foon It o beno fncif lmchnira, btit a adulterated. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ae eaful

"What are we to do whesn oar meat and drime are polsoned 1" A'- ..aIu
Surely any one of resreclabillty sufficient to gain credence for his assrtion would make a fortune were he to set hIs face strenuously agaionsall Impoiure. and determine to sell only genuine articles, even at a slightly enhanced price,"
Yet, notwithstanding the attenuion already given to the subject by the LegIslatorsi. Ite niatIlonal impDortance, rind the strong expression of feeling onthe part of theentire pres of the country, there still remains topr.ovIde an effectual remedy for this great so3ial evil.
Iet is proved that the rt-rh man Is no safer than the poor one. No oxtemel appearnce af respectability. nor even old-establishea repute can assure the puzrchaseer of Imnmunity from PAulteration, the retZt dealer Irimeelf being frequently the victim of the whole-ale dealer, who in turn in at the mercy of the mnanufacturer.
Those isho constole thnstrelve-s withi the idea that the Illiit admIxtoru Are of an Innocent nature should study the report of the Coinmaitte. tco the House of Commorns, and they will find that, not only do they- suffer in pocket by Paving more than they ought for diluted inaosmaued artilces. bitt they suffer in health from taking into their system slow and core poisot.s.
There In no exaggeration In geyleg that numnbers of Invalids, delic ite women), and tender children, have fallen victims to a lulterations of food, drinks, atid dregs. P.tralysis has also been clearly traced to thin caries, and the universl dlffsion of iudicestlon owes its Origin very largely to the efftect of the dlangerous adulterAtlons of our f,,oo,
Each article vended will be manutfactured or prepared entirely by the Company, and foreign productions will be Imported slirect ; it will therefore derive the rorltit of both maanufacttures and dealer, at the same thus that it esnut-es perfect freedom frost Ad'ilteration.
A wholesale and export trade of unequalled magnitude may already be considered as guaranteed.
All articles will be senot out frees the Cornaumr's warhouases pocked to muit the smiallest as well an the largest consumer, and each papket vwil have the Company'e label so affixed, that it willbeImapossible to op?en,, it withouit destroying the label. Every one mnust at once see thtthis will be a thorough guarantee, as the Company can pack, if necessary, ft-on ohe nunsc-to one hundred-weight; sach separate W,acse betn firmly secured by the label and seal of the Company.
n ames of the various dealers of whom the Comrpanyl' goods maay be Obtained will be advertised trom time to time la the local papers for each district.
The analysis will be conducted by one of the meet eminent analytical chyrmista ot the present day, and the Comnany will hold themselves pledged. to the purity of every article told by them.
The Dircectora are anxious that the Company should proceed In3 the ineset careful manner, Anid are determined that not merely the purity but the eeneral condition of lbs goods shall beall that the moseet ciest super ion and improved machinery can mnate them.-

DUBLIN, THuRsDAY XOnRNiG. THE MLISTERIAL CRISIS.
The defeat of Ministers, although necessitating a dimolution or reconstruction of the Palmerston Cabinet, has created the smalest possible amount of excitement at this side of the Channel. Even the placeexpectant&-the usual waiters on Providence -are less anxious than usua, and the impression here is all but general that, let the crisis terminate as it may, tho supporters of Lord Derby will find that the pear is not yet ri2o for the plucking of the chiefs, and that the time is still unfavourable for a repetition of the expe4ment of 1852. Lord Carlisle
ield his second Levee for the smaon yesterday, and from obvious causes it was anticipated that the attendance would be even less 3umerous than is usual on the occasion of the second ceremonial. Such, however, was not t'.e case, as the assemblage was highly respectable, ar.d compried about 800 names of the gentry at present in town.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Seeing in Vic Times newspaper of February 26th a paragrapL concerning myself and Sergeant M'Wheeney,of the 44th Regiment, I trust you wiUl kindly give insertion to this letter in 27Vc Tims of to-morrow.
There are two statements in that paragraph vhich aro utterly false. First, it is asserted that in the skirmish -which took place on October 20th, 18,i4, between a party of our regiment's sharpshooters and the Russians, in which Private John Keano was dangerously wounded, Sergeant M'Wheeney took the wounded man on his back. and conveyed him to a place of safety under a very heavv fire. Now,I can provethis to be an utter and shameless falsehood. It was I -who carried Privato John Reane on my back to a place of safety, and I then returned back to thu spob for another man who was wounded by his, Private John Keane's, side in the Woronwoff-road, and brought him into the same place of safety as I had taken Private J. Keane to. I then ventured my life to go up to the intrenchments, a distance of several hundred yards, to procure a stretcher to bring in the wonnded men, Aud I procured the stretcher of my owrn commanding-officer, aue returned with it to where I had left them, sending Privato Reano on the stretcher, and bringing the other nian on my brck, and never left him one moment until I had placed him safely in our own intrenchtments, when the oflicers of the Guards said that I should not carry him any fturther, and immediately sent the man on orne of t oeir stretcihers: to our regiment.al surgeon. Then, in the left attack, I was tho Ist man to retire from the quarries that day, and in doing so I had to fight my way out, and received two bayonet wounds sightly o my right side. It is not my wish to boast of wMa 1 have done, but it is bard when I perilled life and libs for my Queen and country, and ain aisabled by the loss of my sight,"&.,to have nyhlatd-earned honours stolen from me by one who bad no sbare wlhatever in the deeds for which he is rewarded, but which were mine, and mineonly. Asto SergeantPWMheeneyhavingsaveed my life, that is also entirely untrue. I was left on one side for many hours after I was wounded; asd as to the assertion that I and WUWheeney retired after dark, anyone with common sense must see how impossible it was. I received three baUs in my heRd at once, and my right eye wns shot out, besides other injuries. Of coursep I was utterly inea pable of moving, and it was enually impossible for any ono to have covered me, &c., as St'Wheeney is said to bave done. I can bring abundant proots of the truths of what I have here stated ; the officers and comrades of the Guards, a weU as my own commanding-officer there, who saw my exploits in bringing back the wounded, know it to be correct. I ask not praise; I did my duty to my Queen and country; all I request is justice.

DREADFUL COLLIERY ACCIDENT AT SHIPLEY.- About half-put 10 a m. on Wednesday last, while a number of men were at work in the Shipley Colliery, Derbysbiro, an explosion from gunpowvder took place, by which several men and boys were killed and others burnt. The explosion occurred in No. 9 stall of tho hard coal. The staihnen employ powider to blast the coal with, and a quantity (not yet ascertained how much) was in a box close to the work. A spark from one of the workmen's lights nmnst have ignited the powder, and the coneussion of the explosion brought some gas out of the old wste, which fired at aome of the workmen's lights. The works had been examined by an experienced man in the morning, ho could not see any gas at the edges o. tho waste. Tho pit is weeU ventilated, so much so that it has been necersary to secure the lights from the air to keep them lighted. Mr. Hedley, Government inspector, was at the time of the explosion inspectingan adjoining colliery nederground. He at oneo went over, and was down the mine to examine it before the bodies were all Rot out. The ex. plosion has not disturbed any of the air doors, or at all mterfered with thekentilation. An investigation into the cause commenoed yesterday, and an inquest wil be held on the bodies by Mr. Phiston, coroner. The sanies of those killed are-John Starbuck, Arthur Starbuck, Abraham Starbuck, Thomms Renshaw, and J. Richardson. We believe the number injured is 12.

NAVAL OPERATIONS AT CANTON.
The Earl of HARDWICKE.-Seeing the noble lord the Secretary for War in his place, I beg to ask him a question, of which I have not given notice. 'The noble lord must have read in the newspapers of soveral changes havinig taken place in the state of affairs at Canton. It appears that the English have retreated fromn Whampoa, that a portion of the British fleet has been attacked by a squadron of junks, which retired in good order, that the Admiral bas been compelled to abandon the position he had taken up in the wrecks of the factories at Canton, and that at the same time he has burnt down the suburbs of that city. I wish to ask the noble lord the Secretary for 5War *vhether he has received despatches to that effect, and, if so, why they have not been made public. At the same time, we read that at Singapore circumstances have occurred to imperil the safety of the British there; and. as we hear of these events tbrough two channels, they are apparently true, and we may presume the Government have been informed of them. In the present state of public opinion it is imnortant that we should be informed whether despatches have been received.
Lord PANMUIRE.-The question which the noble earlhas put, without notice, is one of a somewhat important character. (Hear.) Of course, no despatches have been addressed to me with reference to the naval operations before Canton, but I have received despatches from the Commander-inChief at EHongkong, stating that the company of a regiment were engaged in burning a certain portion of the suburbs of Canton, and that some casualties had taken place. These casualties will appear in the paper to-morrow.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-Has the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs received no despatches relative to the action of Macao, the retirement from WVhampoa, aud the destruction of the suburbs of Canton?
The Earl of CLARENDON.-A despatch has been received from Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, stating reasons why he thought it necessary to withdraw from the Dntch Folly, which he had occupied, and why he thought;it necessary to destroy a portion of the suburbs, which enabled the people of Canton to act hostilely against the fleet. It has likewise been necessary to send troops for the better protection of Hongkong, where disturbances have taken place, and where rewards have been offered for assassination and incendiarism.
The Earl of ELLENBOROTJG.-The noble earl wil
see the importance of our knowing when the suburbs of Canton were destroyed. If the admiral had determined to remain in the fortress in which he seemed to be intrenched, he would be justified in destroying suburbs that gave a cover to the enemy. But if he had destroyed the fort of Dutch Folly, and had determined upon retiring from Canton, there was no military-no moral justification for the de. struction of those suburbs, and it would be a deliberate and useless act of vengeance. It is therefore necessary for the character of the coantry that we should know when and under what circumstances the destruction of the subarbs of Canton took place.
Lord PANAMURE.-I am surprised that thernoble care should have made observations tending to misrepresent the character of British officers, without waiting to know the circumstances. (Hear, hear.) I must say, my lords, I do on this occasion blush for the conversation that has taken place (cheers), as tending to throw blame upon a gallant officer who is acting so as to maintain the honour of his country, and who at the same has to maintain his own position, under very difficult circumstances. (Hear, hear.) The whole of the circumstances attending upon the change of position are these :-The adniiral was placed in a position at the Dutch Folly in which he found that his ships were so placed that junks coming up the river and sinking impedimnents in his passage would have stopped the return of his ships of war. Finding himself placed in that position in a narrow river, he withdrew, not from before Canton, but to another position-the Bird's Nest Fort, which is close to the neighoourhood of Canton, and where his ships could lie in perfect safety, and where they woule' not be exposed to annoyance from the enemy's junks. In destroying the suburbs of Canton I will stake my character as a peer of Parliament and a gentleman of England that he has done nothing more than fair warfare would justify (hear, hear), and that he has done nothing of that pure act of cruelty which the noble earl has represented. I believe that Sir M. Seymour's character stands as high as an officer in the navy and a Christian gentleman as that of any man in this country. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-The noble lord appears to have misunderstood my meaning. I said distinctly -that all depends upon the time when this Nvas done. If the admiral were not about to retire from his position, then he uight be justified in resorting to such measures as would deprive the enemy of the cover that the suburbs afforded. But if he had determined (which he has done, in fact, by retiring to the Bird's Nest Fort) to retire altogether from before Canton, it would be unjustifiable as a military operation.
Lord PANMJURE.-I deny it.
TREATY WITE PERSIA.
The Earl of MALMESBURY.-I wish to ask the noble earl whether it is true that a treaty has been concluded with Persia; and, if so, whether the Persian Amnbassador who signed that treaty at Paris had fuU Dowers from his Government to do so, or whether it is merely to be referred to his Government.
The Earl of CLARENDON.-In reply to the question of tho noble earl I have to state that a treaty was signed yesterday between Lord Cowley and Feruk lihan, and that the negotiations for that treaty were not signed mitil Her Majesty's Government were satisfied that Feruk Khan had ample powers to negotiate it.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE (who had a notice upon the paper in reference to the war with Persia) said he should not press it at present.
THE OPIUM QUESTION.
The Earl of DERBY, seeing that the noble lord (Shaftesbury) had a motion on the paper fornext Monday relative to the opium trade, wished to know whether he intended to mnove a substantive resolution, and to take the sense of the House upon it, and if so, whether he would lay the resolution he intended to move upon the table.
The Earl of SHIAFTESBURY said that it was his intention to briDg on his motion last Monday, and to move an address to the Crown on the subject of the opium trade in China. On going deeper and deeper into the question, however, he was convinced that the whole system wvas illegal. He had therefore determined to put the matter before a learned counsel, and then so to frame his motion so that the question should be brought up in a technical and legal form, with the view to its being brought before the judges of the realm. It was his intention, if he were alive and well, to bring forward his motion on Monday next, and to bring it forward every year of his life until their lordships arrived at some satisfactory result thereupon. He would lay the questions on the table to-morrow, and move on Mfonday that they be submitted to the judges of the realm.
THE RETIREMENT OF AGED BISHOPS.
Lord DUNGANNON had asked the Lord Privy Seal some short time ago, "Whether Her Majesty's Government contemplated bringing forward any measure for providing
for bishops who, from advanced age or other infirmity,| mightbe desirous of bcein" relieved from episcopal duties 'by relinquishing their sees." HIe understood the noble lord
mreply to have said that such a measure was in contempla-
tion, but he was xeported -- hav ---ated tha-t h a o prepared to give any answer to the question, however im-
portant it might be.
The Earl of HARROWBY said the noble lord was correct in his impression as to the answer he had given, and he was sorry it was not audible elsewhere.
MINISTERIAL EXPLANATION.
EaTl GRANVIIU then rose and said,-I think it is important to give your lordships some information with regard to the course Her Majesty's Government intend to pursue, in consequenco of a certain event of which your lordships are, no doubt, well-informed as having occurred in another place. Her Majesty's Government having found themselves there in a minority, the usual course under smch circumstances would have been to tender their resignations to Her Majesty. After calm consideration of all the circumstances of the case, they have come to the opinion that it is not their duty so to do. considering that in the same place on a moet important question in relation to the finances of the country they found themselves supported by a large majority, and that they received support, for which they are grateful, in your lordships' House on the China question itself,-looking, also, at the composition of the House of Commons, by which it does not appear clear that any strong Government can be formed in it5 present state, and considering, further,
that during the five years' existence of tho present Parliament there have been three different Governments, and the nation has passed from a stato of peace to a state of
war and again to a state of peace, Her Majesty's Govern- ' ment think it will be for the advantage of the country and for the public interest that reference should be mado to thoe country to ascertain what its wishes are as to the fature. (Elear, hear.) Without going into more detailed reasons for adopting this course, all I have to add is that Her Majesty's Government will only ask the sanction of both Houses to measures of a temporary character, so as to enable the appeal to be made as soon as possible, with the view of recalling Parliament as soon as a new Parliament can be collected, and then ascertaining what the wishes of the country are as to what parties shall rule the nation. (Hear.) I cannot anticipate that in that course they will meet with any opposition; at all events, I submit the reasonableness and fairness of ascertaining what is the real feeling of the country. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GREY.-I have certainly no wish to raise discussion on this occasion, but it occurs to me that there is an omission in the statement which the noble earl has just made. I will rea ind your lordships that in former cases, when a Government has been defeated in the House of Commons, and, upon that defeat, instead of resigning theirzoffices into the hands of lSer Majesty, has thought fit to appeal to the country, in all prior cases of this kind the difference has arisen with regard to the legislative policy of the country. It was so in 1784, when Mr. Pitt in that memorable instance held office against a majority of the House of Commons. It was so in 1841, when a question arose as to the commercial and financial policy of the Government. In all these cases no material public inconvenience arose from leaving in uncertainty until the new Parliament met what should be the policy of the country. But allow me to point out to your lordships that this case is widely different. The House of Commons has condemned the poHcy of Her Ma. jesty's Government, not upon a legislative question, but upon the highest question of executive policy with which they have to deal. It is upon a question of peace or war. (Hear, hear.) The House of Commons has come to a resolution, which I am perfectly in order in quoting from the votes laid on your lordships' table:-
"1 That this House considers that the papers which have been laid upon the table fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resorted to at Canton in the late affair of the Arrow."
Consider, my lords, what is the serious effect of that resolution. It is this,-that the country is now virtually engaged in a war which has been branded as unjust by the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) The affairs of England are intrusted in that country to the management of a person who by a vote of the House of Commnonsisbrandedwith having without due justification entered on these violent measures. Now, my lords, having just heard that the end of May is the earliest period when Her Majesty's Government anticipate another House of Commons can be called together, I wish to know whether in the interval, in which events of tremendous importance may take place, the policy branded by the House of Commons is to be pursued, and whether the treatment of these most important questions which must arise in China is stUIl to be committed to the hands of the man whose moral authority in that country is, I say, destroyed by the vote which has taken place. (Hear, hear.) My lords, it appears to me impossible that in the face of the vote recently given by the House of Commons tho policy which has hitherto been pursued can be perse. vered in, or the affairs of England in Canton be intrusted to the hands in which they are at present placed. I submit that if the twvo Houses are called on to give those facilities which are expected by Her Majesty's Government, in order that they may make the appeal to the country which they desire-if we are to give those facilities which I need not tell your lordships either House has the power of refusing-we are entitled to satisfaction on this point from Her Majesty's Government, and I can venture to say what, in my opinion, they ought to do. I think they ought at once and forthwith to recall Sir J. Bo wring. (Hear, hear.) I think they ought to send out a person of high character, in whose discretion and judgment great confidence can be placed, with very wide discretionary powers, to bring the war, if possible, to a conclusion. I think they ought to do, what I have no doubt they have done alreadynamely, taken al the measures in their power to protect the lives and property of Hler Majesty's subjects in China (Hear, hear.) But I say this is, of aU things, mosS essential, that the individual who has brought the country into its present critical position and involved it in hostilities should not remain intrusted with the high duties of Her Majesty's plenipotenUary. Certainly, unless Her Majesty's Government are prepared to give satisfaction on that point, I think it is the duaty of this and the other House, by humble address to Her Majesty, to express the wish, I am sorry to say, they must feel. and if no other member of your lordships' Houso more able to undertake the task present himself, I shaUl be prepared to move such an address. (Hear.)
Earl GRANVILLE.-I could perfectly understandthe question which has been put by the noble earl being put in another place, where the resolution has been affirmed; but I do not see the same propriety in the noble earl's putting the question in your lordships' assembly, when, after full discussion, you have come, by a large majority, to a contrary opinion. (Cheers.) At the same time, I should be most unwilling to refuse any general information as to the course of the Government which it is in my power to give. I can only assure your lordships that even before the close of the debatewe had taken into our deepest consideration the best means of determining the present unsatisfactory state of relations between China and this country. We do not con. sider that the House of Commons intended by that resolution to indicate that we should refrain from taking every necessary step for the defence of the lives and property of British subjects in China, or that we should pateh up matters in a rash and precipitate manner, without reference to the position of things at the time. We think we act in consonance with the decision of the House of Commons, though not admitting its justice, if we take every step which, in our judgment, is best calculated to settle the question as a whole, and that we shaU not incur blame by so doing either from your lordships or from the other House, even in its present state-stil less, we hope, when Parliament is re-elected after a dissolution. (Hear, hear.)
The Probates and Letters of Administration Bill went through committeeps- fo -sr, and was ordered to be reprinted.
CHIEF CONSTABLES BILL.
Earl GRANVILLE moved the thirdi reading of this BiWl.
The Marquis of SALISBURY hoped the third reading would not be pressed at present. lle moved that the third reading be deferred until after the production of the correspondence which had taken pslace between Sir G. Grey and the magitrats of Staffordsnre upon a point with which the Bmwas intended to deaL.
After a brief but inaudible conversation the House divided, when there appeared:-
Contents ... ... ... ... ... 28 Non-contents ... ... ... ... ... 13
Majority for the third reading ... -15
The Bill was accordingly read a third time and passed, as were also the Public Health Supplemental Bill (1857) and the Ionian Subjects Commissions Bil.
POOR BENEFICES IN THE DIOCESS OF LONDON.
Viscount DUNGANNON, in moving for a return of the number of benefices within the diocess of London having endowments under 2001. a-year, said, since he ihad given notice of his intention to move for that return he had received several communications from London clergymen on the subject of it. One of these was from the Rev. Mr.
eleUy, the incumbent of St. John's, Hoxton, who stated that the church there was consecrated in 1826, that he was then appointed minister of it, and that there was no endowment of the church. He added that in 1851 the population of St. John's was 21,365; that his average net income from pew rents, marriage fees, &c., was 3301., and from burial fees 2101., maldng together 5401. The effect of the Act passed a few years ago for regulating the burial of persons dying in the metropols had been to reduce his income from 5401. to 3301., and that after he had been 30 years aminister of that church. In addition to that, he was liable to pay 1901. a-year out of the burial fees to a fund of the churchwardens which went to defray
certain expenses connected with the church. He (Visconnt Dungannon) submitted that that was a very hard case, and he beieved it was only one among many such. It was a melancholy fact that the Legislature was not doing anything whatever towards placing the parochial clergy in populous parishes in the position in which they ought to be; and if their lordships would grant him the return for which he asked it would show an extraordinary catalogue of populons parishes with very poor endowments. He hopec the tune nadarnved when these matters would receive serious consideration, and wvhen some satisfactory information wvold be given as to how the very large sum in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissionerswas disposed of Of course that commission entailed a certain degree of expense and required a certain number of offucials, nor did he complain of propor remuneration being given to those officials, hut he did think that some account ought to be rendered to this House and to the public as to the manner in which those funds were applied. He was not to be told that because in certain parishes the clergymen occasionaly received large fees, or because they had large congregations, therefore they were to be considered wel endowed. These were matters of chance and favour to which the Church of England ought not to be exposed, and he thought that the information which he now sought to obtain would fuly
justify the course he had taken on this question. The noble I viscount concluded by moving for " A return of the number! of benefices within the diocess of London having endowments under 2001. a year; specifying the population in connexion with such benefices, the namae of each benefice, and those of them which are without a residence for the incumbent."
The Earl of HARROWBY bad no objection to the production of the return moved for, and was glad to see that the noble viscount haLd turned his attention to this important subject. With respect to theEcolesiaestic,lCoimnisaion, however, the noble viscount seemed to be unaware that, not only did that commission present an annual report to Parliam ent,
containing every possible detail as to its proceedings, bu that on two occasions Parliament had made this the aubject of most minute investigation. So lately as last year the House of Commons appoin'ed a committee which received evidence in detail from the officials employed, and to tho report of this committee he would refer the noble viscount, or information respecting the expenditure and the proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Commission. If he remembered rightly, the commission had made an augmentation of the endowments of benefices to the amount of 86,0001. a-year. [Viscount Dungannon.-I believe a miserably smaU sum was added to each benefice.] That might be, but there was an immense number of claimants, and it was impossible to give what might be wished to each of these. It might be a question for discussion as to whether it was desirable to give more to few or less to many, but the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, acting, he believed, in accordance with definite instructions from Parliament, had gone on the principle of givingsmallsums to a great manyratherthanlargeramounts to few. No doubt a large body of the clergy of the established choirch were possessed of endowments totaUy inadeuate but! the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were doing tebest with the funds at their disposal, and could not be accused of partiality as to the distribution of those funds. Then, too, very desirable reforms had been introduced. It used to he the practice for a persorn to hold two, or three, or four small benefices, performing service in each sometimes once a-fortnight, sometimes once a month, and yet receiving from all of them a very inadequate remuneration. For good reasons it had been thought better that each parish should have its own clergyman, but in laymig down and applying this provision it naturaDy tappened that in some instances the endowments were of very small amount. He was afraid that he could not entertain any very sanguine hope of the deficiencies which had been occasioned being made up from any existing fund.
Ths Bishop of LONDON said, that many of the clergy had suffered severely from the recent alterations. In one p'h the income of the incumbent had been diminished by 408l., in another by 5821., and many others had sufaered m an equal proportion.
After a few words from the LosD CHA?ocELLOR the returns were ordered.
The House adjourned at 20 minutes past 6 o'clock
House Of Commons, Thursday, March 5.

GOOD CONDUCT MONEY.
Mr. PELLATT asked the Under-Secretary for War what steps Government had taken, by warrant or otherwise, for restoring to sergeants in the army the good conduct mroney which they enjoyed before promotion,-viz., ld. per day for every five years' service, of which they had been for so many years deprived; and whether it would have a retrospective as well as a prospective effect; also, whether it would benefit sergeants of cavalry, artillery, engineers, and Marines, as well as those of the line ?
Mr. PEEL said that soldiers receiving good conduct pay had been renuired to relinquish it on bein promoted to the rank of sergeant. This was felt to be a hardship, and in consequence a wrarrant was issued allowing the good conduct money to be added to the pay of sergeant. This warrant applied to the artillery and engineers, as well as to the cavalry and infntry, but not to the marnes. He explained that it w ould be retrospective to a certain extent.
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
Mr. ADDERLEY asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he had a Bill in preparation for uniformity of weights and measures?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that an hon. member had already caUed attention to the subject, and contemplated the bringing in of a Bill. The Government would afford facilities for its preparation, but there was no intention on the part of the Government to bring in a Bill.
THE WAR IN CHINA.
Sir T. HERBERT asked the First Lord of the Admiralty if he had any objection to lay upon the table of the House the instructions Sir M. Seymour received from the Admiralty for his guidance as Commander-in-Chief in the China seas, and in what relation he was placed with reference to crrying out any requisition made to him by Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary and Governor at Hongk-ong?
Sir C. WOOD.-I object on general grounds to the production of instractions given to Sir x Seymour, or to any other officer in a similar situation. Probably, what the hon. and gallant officer wishes to know will be answered by my teling hib that Sir A. Seymour had no other instruc tions than any commmnder-in-chief on any foreign station. He was placed in relation with Sir J. Bowring in no other mode than that in which anyl commander on a foreign station is placed as regards the Ministers or ambassadors
within the Jim'its of his command, with whom, of course, he communicates on all subjects connected with the duty which he has to discharge.
INDIA. In answer to M1r. CAYLLY,
MIr. V. SMITH said, that Her Majesty's Government did not at present intend to establish a system of weeldy communication with India.
CASH PAYMENTS MN THE NAVY. In answer to Mr. OLIVEIA,
Sir C.JWOOD said, that the system ofpayment on foreign stations was by hills of exchange, on which those to whom they were paid sometimes gained and sometimes lost. But a short time ago a system of cash payment was introduced on the East India station. Whether the latter system should be extended to other stations was at present under the consideration of the Board of Admiralty.
MALTA.
Mr. KINNAIRD asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies H he had any objection to lay on the table of the House any despatches from the Governor of Malta on the subject of the working of the jury law in general, and especially with reference to the trial of the murderer of Captain Graves?7
[Lord Palnerston at this stage of theproceedings entered the House, and took his seat on the Treasury bench amid repeated cheers from the Mimisterial side of the House. ]
Mr. LABOUCHERE, replying to Mr. Kinnaird's question, said, he had no objection to the production Lof the papers alluded to.
MNISTERIAL STATRMINT.
Lord PALMERSTON rose, in a crowded House, and amid loud and repeated cheers, to make the eagerly ex. pected Ministerial statement. He said,-hMr. Speaker, in order to regularize that which I am about to say, and to putit in the power of anyhon. member who has anything to say on this subject to address the House, I intend to conclude the statement which I am about to make by a formal motion, that this House do now adjourn. Tne House must naturaUy expect that after what happened on Tuesday night I should state to the House the course which upon due reflection Her Majesty's Government mean to pursneUnder ordinary circumstances, after a vote by which the House by a majority-whatever the amount of it might be-affirmed that which many at least who voted considered to be a vote of censure upon the conduct of the Government, there could hardly be an alternative left to the Government as to the course to be pursned. The natural course would be that they should tender to their Sovereign a resignation of their offices, and leave to those who had obtained that majority the task of conducting the affairs of the country. But the present case seemed to us to be of so pecliar a character that we have not thought it our duty to submit to our Sovereign a resignation of our officew. (Loud cheers.) There is another course which the Government under such circumstances might constitutionally adopt, and that is the course which we have deemed it our duty to pursue. We have deemed it our duty to advisa the Crown at the earliest period at which the state of the business of the House will permit us to caU upon the constituendes of the country to exercise ithat privilege which the constitution places in their hAnds. (Cheers.) I say the circumstances are peculiar, because, while on the one hand, looking to the simple result of that last debate we might say that we had lost the confidenceof,this House, yet, on the other hand, looking to the divisions which took place very shortly before upon questions involving very important portion;
of the policy of the Government, the result Ws of a very different character. (Hear.) And I,feel myself free to say that some of those who coneurred in the vote of Tnesday night made it understood that that vote w-as not to be considered as implying a want of confidence on their part in Her Majesty's Government. (E8ear, hear.) Bat itis in to deny that that vote would render it very difficult, if not unseemly, for the Government with regard to which it was passed, to undertake the condact of the business of the country in the ordinary manner during the remainder of a long session. (Hear, hear.) Moreover, the state of parties which that vote indicated appears to me to show-connecting it with the various votes and fluctuating opinions of the House with regard to those majorities on former occasionsthat it would be extremely difficult for any Government-_
whether that which now exists or that which might be formed, however efficient it might be-and I admit, not merely by way of compliment, but as merely stating the truth, that that Government which might bs formed by a combination of parties (using that expression not by way of taunt) would be very efricient-to carry on the business of the country throughout a sesion in the state of feeling which at present happens to prevail in this House. I will not alludo to the very strongly marked difference of opinion between the two Housesof Parliamentupon the question which was put to issue on Tuesday night. I do not think that would be a sufficient reason, but stiU it is an element to show what various opinions exist in regard to the present Administration as compared with that which might be its successor. This Parliament is now in its fiLth sesion, and, measuring its duration by that which it has seen, it ir a very old Parlament, for it has witnessed more important events than it has fallen to the lot of most Parliamnents to see. It has seen three Administrations (a slight laugh)-the Administration which called it together, the Administration which followed, and the Administration which now sits on these benches. It has seen the transition from a state of profound peace to a great European war; and it has seen the transtdion from a great European war to the fortunate restoration of European peace. Therefore, as concerns the events of which it has been a spectator, this Parliament has done as much as could be expectedto faU to the lot of one which had completed its full term of existence. If the state of business would have admitted of an immediate appeal to our constituents, that is the course which would have been most proper and most seemly (cheers), but the state of public business does not admit of the adoption of such a course. We have as yet voted nothing upon the estimates for the public service; we have arranged nothing in regard to the taxes, some of which require to be remodellie; we have not passed a Mutiny Act, and that in existence wil expire before it would be possible for Parliament to reas.emnble and provide for the maintenance and discipline of the army. The course which I humbly beg to propose to this House, therefore, is, that we should do on the present occasion that which has been done on former and similar occasions, that which was done in spirit during the Administration of Lord Derby. when it was announced that there was to be a dissolution,-that the House should content itselfwith those provisional and temporary measures which may be necessry to provide for the public service until the earliest period at which a new Parliament can assemble. We had proposed to arrange certain taxes for three years; we shall now propose to determine them for only one year. There are some taxes with regard to which it would be very embarrasing to commence to have them settled for too short a period, but we do not think that a Parliament which is aboeLt to bo dissolved could properly be called upon to fix them for a period longer than the year for which provision is to be made. (Hear, hear.) Upon the same principle, we shall propose to the House to vote sams on account of the Estimates for ouly a portion of tho year, and to a pass a Mutiny Aet for a similar period, thus leaving the new Parliament, which may probably assemble somewhat towards the end of May, free to deal with all these greatmatters according to its dscretion. I should hope, Sir, that this HIouse will see that the course which we are prepared to adopt is one which is in accordance with the principles of 'he constitution (hear, hear), and that gentlemen wil therefore place no obstractions in the way of our arriving at a time when fresh elections may take place, bv interposing- any unnecessary difficulties in the way of the adoption of the coarse by which we propose to provide for the public service. (Hear, hear.) We shall abstain from proposing anything but that which is necessary for this purpose. There are many gentlemen who entertain strong opinions upon many subjects which they would wish to bring under discussion in this House, but they will, I think, feel that steps of importance cananot pr-iperly be taken by a Parliament situated as this House of Commons will now necessarily be. I therefore hope that the same honourable forbearance which has been shown by former Parliaments under similar circumstances will be exhibited by this one. There is this to be said, that now at least the country will have a reaUy fair choice bet.ween two different Administrations-a choice which, without meaning to say anything offensive to any party in this
oUse-I think I may say it could not have had, at least not to the same degree, under that combination that took place which has led to the state of things in which the Government nowv finds itself. As I said before, I nam stating a fact without making the slightest imputation upon those who have formed that combination; but I say that so far it may be an advantage to the country-ic will have the opportunity of choosing between two different efficient Administrations. That, also, is a ground which the more justifies us in throwing upon the country tbe responsibility of determining what Administration shaU be invested with the conduct and management of the affairs of the nation. (Cheers.) The noble lord concluded by moving the adjournment of the House.
Mr. DisSxELi and mr. ConnsEN rose together. The Sp;F.E having caUed upon the former,
Mr. DISRAELI said,-The noble lord has dealt frankly with the House, and I wish, as I am sure that every other hon. gentleman will wish, to respond to his appeal in the same spirit. (Hear, hear.) I am not kur
prised at the counsel which thenoble lord and his colleagues have tendered to their Sovereign. I think that the course which they have recommended will, on the whole, be the most dvantageoUs to the public interest. (Hear, hear.) With these feelings, I shall myself give every possible facility to the progress of public business (cheers), consistent with what I conceive to be the true interest of the country. Sir, I share in the anticipation expressed by the noble lord, that this appeal to the country, which I for one look to with no apprehension, will prove of great advantage to the public service. I do think that it is of the utmost importance to the character of Parliament and to the interests of the realm that Parliamentary parties should be more defined than they have been. (Cheers.) Iaam myself persuaded that that habit, which has of late been much adopted, of decrying the influence of party, has bad a verv injurious effect upon the conduct of public affairs. (IHear, hear.) Party, weU defined and well appreciated, is the best guarantee for public and private honour; and I trast that when this recurrence to the sense of the country Las taL-en place, members wlnl be returned to this House with definite opinions (ironical cheers from the Ministerial benches, and counter cheers from the Opposition); that we shall know who is prepared to change and who is ready to maintain the institutions of the country; who is in favour of the reduction of the burdens of the people, and who is in favour of increasing them; who is in favour of a foreign policy which, while it maintains the true interests and dignity of the conntry, is conciliatory to all other States; and who is in favour of that turbulent and aggressive system (cries of " Oh, oh I" and cheers) which, I believe, must increase the burdens of the people and ultimately endanger and diminish the power of our nation. ("Oh, oh 1" and "Hear,hear.n) Irepeat that Ishallmeet the invitation of the noble lord with the same frankness and candour with which it has been given; he will experienc3 from me, and I think I may answer for every gentleman on this side of the House, no sinister conduct. We shall give every facility to any mesure which we believe is sincerely intended forthe publc service, but at the same time we shall
expect from the Government a clear description of what is to be their course, because several matters have been bronght before the House which, so far s I can judge at present, cannot be cast aside so lightly as the noble lord seems to anticipate. With this exception, I repeat that, so far as the public interests are not endangered, the noble lord may depend upon my most cordial assishnce in bringing this Session to a close. (Cheers.)
Mr. COBDEN.-I rose at the same time as the right hon. gentleman because I think there was an omission in the speech of the noble lord which it would have been weR to have had supplied before any further remarks were made. On Tuesday last, Sir, ater a debate of four nights, unparalleled for the aay of speakers who took part in it, and for the ability of their arments, since the time when Sir I. Peel retired from office, this House came to a solemn vote on a question affecing not merely ordinary interests guch As we are in the habit of deliberating upon in this House, but affecting the lives of vast numbers of people at a dist&nce from our shores. That vote has attracted and will attract a world-wide notice, but it has been entirely ignored in the remarks which the noble lord has made to ns today. (Hear, hear.) T do not rise to may one word in opposition to the proposal of the noble lord to dissolve Parliament. I think that if the noble lord, in going to the country, wishes to have a cry which mAy be eminently servioeble to his oppDDents and very damagingto his followers, he has hit upon it; forwhatmustbothecry raised at the hustingsbythose who, in consequence of the decision of the noble lord, go thern forre-election under present circunstances? During tho last 10 days the noble lord hS torn from the hands of my
hon. friend the member for Surrey (Mr. Locl-e King) the last remainingrag of the old reform banner. (Hear.) He has trampledunderfooteventhat miserable modicum of reform,
a 10!. county franchise, and has voted against everything | which has entered into the traditions of the Liberal party and for which we have professed to have any affection; he has slapped in the face my hon. friend the member for the Tower Hnamlets (Sir W. Clay) with his propoal for the abolition of church-rates, and now he sends his foilowers to the country with the cry, "Palmerston for ever! No reform, and A Chinese var "' (Cheers.) If the noble lord wishes to go to an election in which he wiU play into the hands of hon. gentlemen oppositc, he has hit upon a rery good dence; and I am sorry to see that so many of my hon. friends an the same side are ready to foUow him, Bnt I leave that point, to come to 'what the n,,ble lord is about todo in conTequence of the vote of this House on Tues. day night. (Hear, hear.) That is a pressing and practical question, and I win show that it is so from the Government's own point of view. All 'he right hon. gentlemen who spoke during the late debate from the Treary benches told us that the effectl of an adverse' vote, when the Chinese were aware of it, would be to imperil the safety of the English residents in China-that it night extend the qphere of operations, which are becoming exceedingly prejudicial to British interests in the East. Well, the result of that vote has now gone out to China by the mail which left yesterday; and I want to know what the noble lord means to do. Though the mail went yesterday, we all know that it is possible to ieave London four days afterits departure, and, by going through France and zid Marseilles, to meet the vessel carrying it at Malta. I speak within the rnxrk when I say that up to the 9th of March letters may be sent from this country to overtake the China mail, which travels by Alexandria and thence overland, but passengers ought to go on the 8'h. I therefore ask the noble lord to explain to the House what course of action he intends to take in consequence of the vote of Tuesday night ? I do not shrink, any more than those who supported me on that occasion, from the responsibility of stating what I think ought to have been the conduct of the executive Government if it held offie a single diy afterthat vote. In a pressing emergency of this importance they have no right to hold office a day longer without showing their readiness to carry out the reso. lution of this House. (Cheers.) I have no hesitation, as far as concerns the opinion of an insignificant unit o£ this assembly like myself, to say what should have been done, aud what ought still to be done, in consequence of that resolution. If the result of that adverse vote is, as the Wmisters assured us, likely to bo imperfectly understood in China, and any danger, according to their statement, is to be apprehended to the British residents in that country, then I say that the first consideration with our eoxecutive Government should be the safety of our feUow-countrymen. I for one do not share in those apprehensions. Judging from the newspalers of what is going on in China, at Hong. kong, and Singapore, I think that before any newrs of Tuesday night's division arrives out there the mischief will have have been about as great as it well can be. But, adopting the position assumed by Her Majesty's Governmentnamely, that danger is reaUy imminent, I say clearly " Send out a competent person by this very steamer (hear, hear), armed with full authority to represent the executive Government at home; let him supersede all the existing authorities in China, and give him distinct instructions to act according as the stato of things which he finds when he gets there may seem to require." (Cheers.) Surely, yon may essily find at three days' notice a masu with a goodenough head on his shoulders to take his instructions from the Government, and go out to fulfil them with discretion in China. The news of our decision must reach Hongkong before it is known elsewhere in China. When it arrives at Hongkong you wiU have au immense force there; and Hongkong, being an island inaccessible from the mainland except by sea, a couple of frigates would bo sufficient to protect it from the whole naval strength of the Chinese empire. You have a great naval forc at Hongkong. What, then, so easyasto sendon the ships not required forthe defence of that island to the points further north? As we learn that a steamer can reach Hongkong before she gets to Canton, then you have time to make your prepartions before the intelligeuce of this adverse vote can do any harm among the Chinese. I am now assuming that the apprehension of danger entertained by the Government is well founded, And pointing out to you the courso that common sense dictates. I repeat, then, "Send out a competent person from England, clothed with full power to supersede all your other authorities in China, and to act as circumstanoes may require." Does the noblo lord intend to do that? If not what does he intend to do? The noble lord said a great deal about the combinations of party and about appealing to the country. But an appeal to thze country, as he tells us himself, cannot lead to any result until the end of May. What is to go on in China in the meantime? (Hear, hear.) What was the purport of our vote on Tuesday? Was it intended to reverse the policy that has been pursued in China, or was it not ? (Cheers-) If that vote meant anything it was this-"That this House would not be responsible for the policy initiated by Sir J. Bowring at Canton on the question of the Arrow." (Cheers.) I humbly submit, then, that if the resolution of this House is to bo taken as a reality, and is to be followed, as is always expected, by practical results, the noble lord is bound to tell us before we separate this very day what courae he intends to take by rasson of that vote. I say,-" Provide first of all for the security of your countrymen abroad. You have abundant forco at command for it." Bnt what are the noble lord's ulterior objects in regard to ourrelations with China ? What does he mean to do with the Government of that country ? In his speech on Tuesday night the noble lord himself seemed to me to indicate the course that ought to be adopted. Ho said that before these unfortunate occurrences took place wo sought the co-opertion of tho French Government, (and we should also, perhaps, have obtained the cooperation of the Anerican Government) in making a reprosentation to the Chinese Government with a view to secare greater facilities for carrying on our commerce. If that can be done, it would be the best mode of putting yomuselves in a position to exercise the greatest influenoe upon China. But for this end it is necessary to clear the ground from your past proceedings, and to renounce the illegality of tho position you have taken up in consequence of the conduct of Sir J. Bowring. The vote of Tuesday renonnced those proceed ings. You have placed yourselves on legal grouna, and are now able to ask other Governments to join with you in the attainment of these objects. I beliere that now they wil joini with you upon your new ground; but it is well under. stood that they would not do so as long as you were contending with the Government of China on tho miserable pleas onow repudiated by the decision of Tuesday (Hear, hear.) I therefore wish only to ask the question which I have put to the noble lord. I don't intend to complicato it with any question relative to a genoral election. Let that event come as soon as it pleases. I predict such a winnowing anda clarifying of the state of parties in this House and in the country as may be of some use to us. (Hear, hear.) But one point put by tue noble lord a little puzzled me. I understood him to say that the public would be able to judge between his Administration and some Administration in possC to be formed from the Opposition. Nothing, I think, could be more difficult for the country than to judge between the noble lerd and the gentlemen who sit on the front bench opposite to him. (Hear, hear.) As far as I can como to any conclusion, after a long experience of this House, I have arrived at the conviction that tho noble lord now at the head of the Government may be deemed as good a Tory as anybody who sits on tho opposite benches (a laugh); and whether he sits on this or on the other side of the House it will not make much difference to the liberties of tho people(Hesr, bear,) I wish, Sir, to know what course the God vernment intend to take in pursuance of the voto of Tausday night ? (Hear, hear.)
Sir C, WOOD.-I should have thought, Sir, that my hon. friend the member for the West Riding had had sufficiently clear information as to vhat conduct mKy noble friend and Her Majesty's Government intend to adopt in
consequence of the vote of Tuesdxy night. With regard to the question which my hon. friend at present raises, it is not my intention in any way to reopen a debate that has been closed. (Hear, heaLr) I am glad that my hon. friend is at last sensible that some danger may arise to the lives and the propertyof our fcelow-countrymen in China in consequence of the vote which he called on the Houso to give the other night. (Rear, hear.) I wish that he had only thought of that before he made his motion. (Rear.) I confems that I do share the alarm which he has expressed (" NTo, no I', and I rise for the purpose of a;suring the House that, as far as I know, I believe ther are at this time a sufficient number of vessels of war at China to enable efficieut meares to be taken to prevent that danger from prodecing any evil efoct' There is one lazge frigate at Sbhaghai at this moment, and another atone of the northern ports; and probsbly by this date, or at least in the early part of this month, three large seam frigates and seven or eight gunboats wi have arrived in the river of Canton. (Hear, her.) A large frigate and two other esJeies wizre ir the course of the month of April, two more frigates willarrive ir May, a third wil get thero in June. Thoseorders were issued quite irrespectiv, of the late debate, adI can only assure my hon. friend and the HoUe that the Govrment are now takdng measus in order to ecure as far asin them lies, the lives and the property of British sabjects. (pear, hear.)
Sir J. WALSHI said that having voted in favour of the rcsolution of the bon member for the West Riding be was anxiou tha the motive which ad led him to give that vote should not bezmiunderstoodL The isme raised by that
resolution he conceived to bo this,-that the conduct of Sir J. Bowing, in his capacity of reDresentstiVe of the Bntish Crown inCChina, had been indiscreet, and that it had entdloe very serious consoquenCec to this country. It was on that issue that ho had voted, but It was impo.srblo h gy that the decision arrived at by the House should have tho effest of reversing the policy which had been pursued, oonsido:ing that the circumstanceg of tho cseo bad ginso so Inuoh altered. Unfortunately, the bad passions of this semi. barbarous poople had been raised, and the atrocities which they had committed, and the breaches of all international law of which they had becn guilty, altogother changed tha circuntanoes of the case. While adhering, therefore, t, his opinion that Sir John Bowring had by his injudicious conduct led the country into these difficulties, and war personally responsible for all the results which had followed. ho did not wish that his vote should be interproted se baving the effect of tying tho hands of the Government as to any future steps which they might think it necessary to take for tho protection of British lives and property, ani for the maintenance of British interests in the Chinoss seas. The isrge on which the Government was about to go to ttho country was the narrowest possible. It was not thl
conduct of the Ministers themselves, because thoy had only adopted the aets of Sir John oarwing by an cex po factA proceeding; it was the conduct and ability of Sir John Bowring himself. (Hear.)
Mr. DEEDES said that ho entirey approved the cours, which tho rob'e lord at tho head of tho Government pro. posod to tPke with regard to public business; but he should beglad tohar from him the coreo which thoGovemment intended totakewith regard, tothe privato business, whichwas at present in such a stato that the abrupt termination of the session would cause tho greatest inconrenience and expense to the parties conoerned. (Hear, hear.) On a formor occa. sion of a similar nature the lious had come to a resolution to this e£ct,-"Tho promotors of all railway Bis in the present session shall be matpovered on the aoon4 reading. or on tho completion of any subsequent stage o reAh Bilg,
when the Bill has beon roferred to a select committee, but the case for the promoters has not been opened, to abandon any further proccedings in the present session, with tho option, under the foUowing conditions, of proceoding with the'same Bill, in the next session of Parliament, at the samo stage at which it shall have been suspended." Thea followed certain conditions under which this privilege was to be allowed. He wished to know whether the Government would propose on this occasion any such:resolation as this, and if that were their intention he hoped its terms would be extended so as to include all private Bills. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. S. lERBEBRT.-Beforo tho noble lord answers th, question of the hon. member for Kent I wish to call his ,t. tention to the question which was put by my hon. friend th3 member for the West Riding, and which I think has no' yet been answered (cheers), for it was entirely misunderstood by my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty. (Hear, hear.) Thecircumstances in which we ar
placed are very peculiar. We have many precedents of an appeal being made to tho people by a Minister placed in a minority, but you will find that in almost all provious casos the Govermment have been in a minority upon some legisla. tive subject3 upon which the decision of the people could bo takon at once; but in this Instance the Government arn plaed in A minority by the House of Commons haring expressed an opinion adverse to that of the Government as to the origin of a war now being carried on. Clearly, there. fore, if no pledge is given by the Government as to th3 courso which they intend to take in consequence of the vot, of the House of Commons, that war may continue to bo conducted by the .me instruments, the power oE directing Its operations may bo left in tho hands of the same persons on whose proceedings tho House of Common; has already pronounced a condemnation. (Cheers.) Iy hon. friend near me did not say that he apprehended any danger in consequence of the vote which was given by the House oa Commons. (Cheers) What he did Say, I believe, 'a; that, as the Government anticipated that danger woula result from that vote ho wished to know whether, looking at it in their point Of viow, thoy intended to take stops to avert the evils which they apprehended. I repeat my hon_ friend's question, and I add this to it-what are tho stops t; bc taken to prevent the evils which I apprehond, and which I think every gentleman who has read the newspapers to-day must also apprehend 7 We have seen tho state of things at Hongkong. Wo are told now of tho retirement of the fleet from tho inner waters of Canton, and a state of feoling ij described as existing at Singapore and throughout the East in consequence of tho excitement of the Chinese population, which exposes tho lives and property of British residents to imminent dnger. These things, if they be true, do no; owe their origin to the voto of the House of Commons; but tboy have followed naturay and as a matter of course from our procoedings in China. (Choer&) I wish to know, therefore, whether the Government during the long perlod' which must elapse before Parliament can be re-assembler! are about to continue tho 'war for the same objects as thafor which it was begun-the introduction into Canton o; Sir J. Bowring (hear, heat), and is the conduct of affa:r,, whether for peace or for -war, to be left in the hands of tho man who, in the opinion of the House of Commons has, by his want of judgment and capacity, brought about a st t3 of things so detrimental to British interests and British honour? (Cheers.) I hopo some mcmoor of the Government will answer that question. I should prefer that it should be the noble lord himself, and, in order to givo him the opportunity, I will move that this debate be now ad. jourmed.
The SPEAxEER-That would be out of order, but thl noble lord has the right of reply. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. S. HERBERT.-I hope, thon, that tho noble lord Will answer my question, for it is ono to which the Housa and tho country havo a right to expect a reply, and I hopa the noble lord will not think me impertinent in putting it to him. (Hear, hear.)
Sir G. GREY-In answer to the hon. member for ZBut Kent I have to say that it is the intention of the Govern. ment to propose to both lIouses of Parliament a resolation similr in substznce to that which he has read, for the purpose of avoiding the inconvenience which must result to persons interested in private BiUls from an abrupt dissolu. tson of Parliament, and which will have the effect of enabling those perons to recommence in a futura Parliament proceedings in private BiUs now before the House as nearly as possible at the same 1,taza at which they are susponded in this session. Wit, regard to the question just addressed to the Govern. mcnt by my right hon. friend, though I must protest against tho unfair representation which he has given of tha ground on which wo are now carrying on hostilities at Canton, since he assumes that the Government have in, volvod the country in war for the mere purposo of introducing Sir J. Bowring into Canton, I havo no hesita, tion in saying that tho Government have had their attention most seriously directed to those circum. stances calculated to produco great alarm, the nows of which has becn brought to this country by tha last mail. They lament these circumstances, but they feol that tho danger which the right hon gentleman and thosa who sit noar him anticipate from thern is likely to bo very greatly increased by tho decision at wlhich this House arriveE on Tuesday. (Hear.) With that imprpssion forced upon their minds, the Government foel that it is their duty -as it was beforo, though more partioularly now, after th t dcision-to take every precaution which, acting on tho r responsibility, they feel to be necessary for tho protection E.f British interost and British honour. (Hlear, hear.) They do not intend so far to defer to tho opinion expressod by the House of Commons as to sond out orders to our civil and military offloors in that part of the world in acoordaneo witbl w-ht they understand to be the view- of the hon. member for the West Riding. They think that to direct our officere to abandon the demands which theyhave thoughtit their duty to make, and to abstAin from further hostile proceedings,with a view to tho cnforcement of those demands, would be to
compromise the honour and dignity of England. (Cheers.) With an appeal to the country before them they will not shrink from tho responsibility of taking those measures and giving those directions which they think most conducive to tho honour of the country and best calculated to protect tha
lives and property, not only of Britith subjocts, but of al foreign residents in those parts of the world. With rega-d to ulterior mexsures, and tho means by which thoso measures are to be accomplished, the hon. gentleman tho member for the West Riding has no right to assume that tho Government have now, in consequenceo of the decision ot the House of Commons, abandoned tho intention whici
was indicated by my noble friend, to endeavour to place o r relations with China upon such a satisfactory and permna nent footing as will, in their opinion, afford the best secu. rity against the recurrence of the calamitous circumstances which have recently taken placo in China. In tho accsa.
plidhment of that object they wAll use those means and tho 'o instruments which they think best calculated to lead t a Satisfactory relt and bet fitted to support the honour and interests of England. (YIear, hear.)
Lord . RIUSSELL adMr GLAso.N ro1 together, but the right hon. gentleman gave way, and tho noble lor I said,-I really wish that Her Najesty's Government would enable us to help them in attaining the objects which they say thoy dosire to acoompliab. (Cbeers.) I rmust observe in the first place that we, the House of Commons, are about to undergo the prooess which Mr. Fox and his friends used to call "a penal diaolution." (" Hexr," and a laugh.) Wa have come to a certain vote, and the House is to be punihed for adopting tbat vote. (Cheers.) Tho nebI' lord (Lord Palmerston) asks the House of Commons toassis: him by passing votes of supply as rapidly as woe cn. Thi
niolble lord calls upon us to depart from the usual order of our proceedings, and to abandon the attempt to carry meaFares which are of great importance to the country, in order
to assist him in the object of making an appeal to the opi- | sion of the country. The right hon. gentleman opposite <Mr. Disraeli) said that he for his own part-and I suppose lie speaks for those who act with him-has every disposition to afford facilities for that appeal. But surely if the House of Commons is asked to afford these facilities, it may fairly
equire an explanation of the policy which is to be pursued (luring the ensuing three months? (Cheers.) This is no
nnmaterial question. After a debate of four days we came tj the conclusion that the policy which the Government had deemed worthy of approval was, on the contrary, deserving of our censure. (Cheers.) Are we,
tben, to agree to remain entirely mute? Are we to permit, ,he votes of supply to be carried one after another, without
osking what is to happen during this interval of three; months? (Hear, hear.) My noble friend said the other[ ;night that the great object of the Government would be to . protect the lives and property of British subjects. I have I to doubt my noble friend wil take very efficient means for a zomplishing that object, but those lives and that property Lave not beon risked by any vote of this House. (Loud cheers from the Opposition.) It is not the echo of our vote that is just reaching us from China. (Hear, hear.) The intelligence we are receiving is inteligence of the conseqrences that havo been produced by the policy adopted by the Britirh authorities. (Cheers.) May we not, then, sBk Her Mdajesty's Government, "While you take means to protect the lives and property endangered by the polioy that hias been pursued in China, will you not likewise adopt some means for the adjustment of these lamentable differences?" (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend who spoke !est says that my right hon. friend the member for Wilt. shire t(Mr. S. Herbert) misrepresentod the policy of the Government when he said they were pursuing hostilities with the object of obtaining the reception of Sir J, Bowring by thr,Chineso authorities at Canton. That might be a misrepi4untation, but I thought it was a very fair mis. representation. ("Hear," and a laugh.) The House is, however, left completely in the dark as to the real objects of tho Government, for whatever we assert those objects to be we are sure to be told we are guilty of misrepresentation. (" Hear," and laughter.) The consul who required reparation in the case of the Arrow declared that all the demands on that subject were astified. We are, then, pursuing some other object. That object is not the public reception of our representative in the city of Canton; but when the right 'bon. baronet is asked what the object reaUy is, he vwraps himself up in very general and obscure terms and says he wishes to settle upon permanent foundations our intercourse with China. Everybody will agree that that is a most desirable object (hear, hear), but the question recurs-is that arrangement founded upon any principles which this House has approved ? Is it not, on tho contrary, founded upon priuciples which it has disapproved ? (Hear, hear.) Who are to be the judges of the future arrangements which are to regulato our relations with China ? Are they to be those Tery persons who have involved us in the present diffi. culty? (Cheers from the Opposition.) If that is the case, 1 must say that when we are asked for large votes in supply it will be bat reasonable that we should caU on the Government to declare what terms they intend to propose to China, and with what object hostilities are pursued. (Hear, hear.) I believe the House of Commons was never, during the course of its existence, placed in tho situation of being required to afford the greatest marks of confidence to a Government whose course of policy It has already disapproved (cheers)-of being required to give votes implying its readiness to agree with the Government, while they do not inform us what objects they have in view. (Renaewed cheers.) It doss not appear to me that it would be very difficult for the Government to inform us what those objects are. I don't think there would be any hesitation on the part of the House in agreeing to aU those votes which would be necessary to enable the Crown to appeal to the country by a dissolution. (Hear.) It may be, as many hon. gentlemen seem to think, that the state of parties wil be cleared up by that dissolution. (Cheers from the .linisterial side.) I mnst say I think the noble lord did not very fairly represent the state of affairs when he said the question that might arise upon the vote of Tuesday night would be whether the present Ministry should remain in office and appeal to the country, or whether a Ministry should be formed out of the combination of different parties who supported the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding. I think it ii very possible that persons who read the papers upon China might, without any sort of concert or combination, have come to the same conclusion at which the House arrived the other night. (Loud cheers.) I do not believe that that concert or combination existed. (Renewed cheering.) There Is, as every one kno-vs, a great party sitting on the opposite side of the House. I do not know that they have a combination with any other party, and I suppose they would be the persons to whom Her Majesty, if she were obliged to have recourse to other advisers, would confide the formation of a Ministry. I can only say that any charges of combination which seem to be made, and which, no doubt, wil be got up at the elections (laughter)-any charges of a factious and unscrupulous union of parties in order to obtain a certain object are entirely false and calumnious. (Loud cheers from the Ovposition.) There is no one in a condition to prove such charges, or to bring the least evidence in their SUpport. Certainly the different parties in the House-a great number of the party opposite, and a considerable -number of hon. gentlemen on this side-concurred in the resolution of the hon. member for the West Riding, bat I believe they concurred in it honestly and upon its merits. (Cheers.) However the Government may admire the proceed. mngs of Sir J. Dowring in China, this House is disposed to disapprove them. The House regarded this question-and it is immaterial whether it concerned the Chinese or any other nation-as one relating to war, to hostilities, to the destruction of nany lives, and which might lead to great calamities; and they felt it was a question upon which they were bound to express their opinion irrespective of party prejudice and partialities. (Hear, hear.) I must say, for my own part-having heard that vote of the House attacked, sometimes directly and sometimes covertly, in the course of 'his discussion -that I believe no vote wiU do more honour to the House of Commons in the year 1857. (Cheers.) As the existence of this Parliament is not to be protracted, I must say I think it wiUl always be remembered to its honour that, when it was called upon by the Government to engage in a contest with one of the greatest Powers of Europe, it never hesitated to grant any supplies that were demanded, to adopt any addresses that were proposed, or to vote any number of men that were required. (Hear.) It will be remembered that this Parliament never exhibited the least unwilingness or backwardness to contend with that great Power, but that when it appeared to the House of Commons that we had engaged in hostilities with a weak, an unlwarlike, and an alinost defenceless Power, then, [interpos. ing an interruption to the procedings of the executivo Government which had not been interposed before, they, not less in the cause of humanity than with a view to support
the honour of the country, censured the course that hal; been taken. I think that vote was honourable in itself, sad I believe it wiUl be an honourable precedent in the future history of this country. (Cheers.) I think Par liaments have been too prone to approve hostilities without considering, and weighing, and examining the grounds upon which such hostilities were based. This House has shown that, while it has been ready to make any sacrifice in order to carry on a just and necessary war, it would not approve blindly all hostilities which it might be asked to sanction, and for which no case of justice could be established. (Cheers.) After so much has been said attributing the vote of the other night to every motive rather than a fair and honest decision upon the merits of the question, I cannot bat protest against such an imputation; aud I can only again express my hope that, before this debate ends, my aoble friend (Lord Palmerston) will give us some notionsome distant idea at least-of what are the objects with which we are carrying on hostilities in China, and to what results thay may be expected to lead. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. ROEBUCK.-Sir, the noble lord at theb head of the Government has described the vote come to by this House on Tuesday night as the resuilt of a combination of parties; and by a combination of parties, from the manner in which lie used the phrase, he meant a conspiracy of parties. (Hear,
hear.) In recording their votes on that occasion gentlemen of different political feelings and opinions went into the same lobby. Is that circumstance to be deemed a proof of conspiracy ? (Cheers.) lf so, then the noble lord at the head of the Government, on the recent motion of the hon. member for Surrey, conspired with gentlemen opposite to defeat that motion. (Cheers and laughter.) Speaking for myself-and in doing so I speak also the opinions of a great many gentlemen on this side of the House-I know nothing of any combination of parties. (Cheers.) I was caUed upon to give a vote upon a matter that involved the honour of my country. That honour I deemied in danger from the conduct of the noble lord, and I voted against him on the
mrt.Jon of the hon. member for the West Riding. I did thzjnot because I agreed with the gentlemen opposite, but because I agreed with the resolution of the hon. member (Hear, hear.) I thougbt dishonour and disgrace awaited my country. I thought the only shield that stood between us and disgrace was the vote of this House-that vote to which they came, and in support of which I lent myhumble
voice. (Cheers.) We were told that we were to have an explanation. A trumpery statement has been made (cheers), and that statement is called an explanation. (Hear,
hear.) Anexplanationofwbat? Of policy? No. They
have no polcy (cheers). and hnoe the mecagre explanation
we have this nigat heard. (Hear, he".r) Iu fact, a set of men who acted in the name of England disgraced England; that set of men has been upheld by the noble lord, and this House, coming to the rescue of England's honour, has declared against the noble lord and hisGovernment. (Cheers.) It would have been otherwise if the noble lord had continued to be what he was in times past, when he declared himself the supporter of liberal institutions and liberal opinions. (Hear, hear.) We have not deserted him, but he has deserted us. (Hear, hear.) Where he went we would not follow, because it was to disgrace, and it was because we anticipated disgrace and dishonour to England that we voted against him. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. M'GREGOR wished to hear a distinct answer given to the question put by the hon. member for the West Riding, for that question had not yet been answered. (Hear, hear.) What was to be done with the manwho represented the Government of tbis country at Hongkong ? (Cheers.) Was Sir J. Bowring still the man whom the Ministry delighted to honour? (Hear, hear.) Did they mean to continue confidence in a man who had been guilty, not of an indisoretion, but of a crime? (Hear, hear.) Was he still to represent the greatest monarchy in the world, and have authority over the fleets and armies that might be sent Fo China to defend our countrymen in that part of the world? Whatever might the decision of the House on the proposition of the noble lord, an answer to that question was due to the majority who voted on the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding. (Cheers.)
Mr. GLADSTONE.-After what I may be permitted to call the bare and meagre statement of the noble lord at the head of the Government, the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire rose in his place and stated that he, on his part, would give every facility for advancing the public business. I have not the slightest doubt that the right hon. gentleman asswumed that which it appears to me the House would then have been entitled to assume, but which the answers since given by gentlemen sitting on the Treasury bench show me it would have been wrong in assuming too hastily. (Hear, hear.) I refer to that point which the noble lord the member for the city of London has argued in terms worthy of himself, and in terms which I think will carry conviction both to this House and the country. (Hear, hear) Sir, I can hardly express the amazement with which I listened to the speeches of the First Lord of the Admiralty and of the Secretary for the Home Department. (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Home Department says he does not understand the resolution of the hon. member for the West Riding. I know nothing about the rssolution of the hon. member for the West Riding. I know a resolution which was once the resolution of the hon. member for the West Riding, but which has now become the solemn judgment of the House of Commons. (Cheers.) In the course of our long debate different views different principles, different conclusions, were strongly adopted and urged upon the two sides of that debate. No man went further-indeed, no man went so far-in vindica ting the wretched policy of which we have read some of the results in the journals of the dayl than the noble viscount at the head of the Government. (Hear, hear.) I will not enter into the details of that debate, but every one will remember that views completely opposite were developed on the one side and on the other with regard to the policy and objects of the war in China; and when the Secretary of State for the Home Department accuses my hon. friend near me of being wrong in the inference he drew that we were making war in order to secure an entrance for Sir J. Bowring into Canton, I want to know, if we are not making war for that object, what is the object for which we are making it? (Cheers.) It has no reference to the affair of the Arrow, for that is settled. You cannot escape the effect of the passage in which Consul Parkes has made that final anuouneement to the Chinese. Therefore we can be at war only to find an entrance for Sir J. Bowring into Canton. (Hear, hear.) I have said there were two different sets of opinions developed in the debate with regard to the poliecy and objects of the war. We are now told the House of Commons is to be dissolved. I am not in the least degree dissatisfied with that announcement, as it will remain on record that the reason why the House of Com mons is dissolved is because it has struck a deadly blow at a great iniquity. (Great cheering.) But the question now is-as the House is to be dissolved, as several weeks are to elapse before the dissolution can take place, as several weeks must elapse without a Parliament being in existence in the country, and as some time even after the convocation of the new Parliament may elapse before it can give a distinct judgment on these matters, the question is as clear as day, though two Cabinet Ministers have been unable to comprehend it, upon whose polcy and upon whose principles are your measures in China to be carried on during the interval of throe months that is before us? (Cheers.) That is the question, which has beenplsinly put, and it is one to which the House is bound to require an answer. What is onr position? Hostilities have been commenced in China by the local representative of the British Government. These hostilities have been ardopted, appropriated, mada their own, and vindicated in this and the other House of Parliament by the advisers of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) These hostilities are now going forward. It was the duty of the advisers of the Crown, when they determined on adopting hostilities, to come down in time to the House of Commons and to ask the judgment and approval of the House for those hostilities. (HIear, hear.) Who are to be charged with the expenses of the war? I apprehend it is the people of England. Who is authorized to tax the people of England for carrying on that war? (Hear, hear.) Is it the noble viscolfnt? (Cheers.) I entreat this House not to be beguiled for one moment into forgetfulness of its first and most essential function. (Cheers.) It is our right, and our right alone, to vote the supplies out of which are to be paid the means of carrying on hostilities in China. (Hear, hear.) But, now that these hostilities have been condemned as to their principles and object, the members of the Government come down to this House with that condesmnation before them, speak of it as a resolution of the hon, member for the West Riding, and distinctly intimate to us that the war is to be carried on in China just as it would have beenif that vote had never been come to. (Cheers.) Most anxious as I am, in common with the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, to afford every just and reasonable facility for putting forward the public business, I frankly own that I am not prepared to abdicate the essential duties of the House of Commons. (Cheers.) The House of Commons and its rights and privikges have already been disparaged by the Government. They constituted and created a state of war in Persia, and they began hostilities in China without the authority of Parihament. (Hear, hear.) It is not the duty of Parliament to allow these things to proceed, and then to have a bil rendered, and be told " There is our charge., (Cheers.) You might as well shut up the doors of this House. (Cheers.) It is our duty as well as our privilege at the time when we vote the supplies-before and not after hostilities-to be the judges of the purposes for which those supplies are given. (Hear, hear.) I defy the noble lord to escape from the principle which the constitution of England has laid down as to the right of Parliament over voting the supplies for the purpose of carrying on the undertakings of the Government. (Hear, hear.) I hope, therefore, we shall obtain a clear answer-as yet we have had absolutely none-to the question which has been put before the Government. (Hear, hear.) My noblefriend at the head of the Government told us, most rationally, that he was going to make a statement, and he would move the adjournment of the House in order that gentlemen might be able to comment on it, but he withheld the pith and marrow of his statement from the House. (Hear, hear.) We have been told nothing, indeed, except that we are to be sent about our business, and the only expedlent open to gentlemen near me has been to get up and put questions to the
Government, by the putting of which questions they have forfeited their right of commenting on any statement that may be made. (Hear, hear.) While I shaU listen respectfully to the statement which my noble friend has not made, but which, perhaps, he will presently make, upon this vital and essential subject, I hope it will be understood that there is no pledge or understanding whatever which in any way fetters the free action and judgment of this House, or implies that we are to play a Ministerial part in regard to the taxation of the country, leaving every important duty in the hands of the executive advisers of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) The noble viscount has referred again to-day to the subject of combinations, stating that he was beaten on Tuesday night by a coalition of parties (cheers from the Ministerial benches), and again the faithful band who, I thought, had been immortalized alr eady by the reply of the hon. member for the West Riding, are desirous to acquire additional fame by adding the high sanction of their cheers to the statement of my noble friend that he has been beaten by a combination. (Cheers aud laughter.) I apprehend, Sir, that many questions might be raised upon the meaning of the term combination; but I will say, with due respect to the occupants of the Ministerial benches, that there never was an occasion upon which it was less the interest of the Government to invite a minute exaraination of the contents of the division lists, (Cheers.) In considering these contents I put entirely out of view my right hon. friends who sit near me. I admit, with respect to them and to myself, that our isolated position makes us the natural objects of sWpicion ("H Hear, hear," and a laugh), and that if we be accused of intrigue or combination, though we may feel the eharge unjust, we must bear it with patience, Bat wrhen
I should like to know, has it before - happened that a case so strong bas been eshblished as to compel this House to interpose for the purpose of checking the mad career of Government in a war at the other extremity of the globe! Frequently we have seen this House challenged to the trial of questions of foreign policy; but never upon a single occasion within my recollection has it consented to interfere. It has always felt its own weakness with respect to these matters-its own want of information; and, as that is the fixed rule of Parliament, the presumption is, that when that usage is altered it is altered not without reason. (Hear, hear.) In the present instance Parliament has felt that an overruling necessity compeUed it to interfere for the purpose of rescuing the best interests and-what is dearer than aU interests-the fame and honour of the empire from the hands of men unfitted to guard them. (Cheers.) The majority for the resolution comprised the great party in opposition, which at all times represents either the first or the second power in England. Associated with that party was my noble friend the member for the city of London. (Cheers.) And who is my noble noble friend? I do not speak now on the ground of precise agreement with the noble lord upon every political question; but I speak of himi as history will regard him hereafter, and as England regards him nowv (Cheers.) He is at any rate the man who led the Liberal party in this country during more than 20 most eventfuL years (cheers), and he is the man under whose guidance that party has achieved the greatest triumphs it has ever won. (Renewed cheering.) With bim was joined the ablest and most distinguished man among the popular leaders of England; and in the list of the majority we likewise find the name of the hon. and larned member for Sheffield, who, so far from being a political enemy of the noble lord at the head of the Government, in the year 1850, when he thought the foreign policy of the noble lord upon the whole deserved support and approbation, himself challenged in this House an dverse vote of the House of Lords, and carried a resolution which, no doubt, the noble lord has always regarded as one of the most signal triumphs of his political career. (Hear, hear.) Under these eircumstances, Sir, I think it is a little too much for the members of the Government to challenge an inquiry into the eonstituent parts of the majority by which on Tuesday night they were defeated. But the noble viscount has been so pointed in his allusions to this subject of combination that I feel it my duty, on my own part and on that of my right hon. friends, to say a very few words. My noble friend has spoken to-day of a combination. On a former occasion he spoke not only of a combination, but of the purposes of that combination-of a secret treaty for the acquisition of office. Sir, the hon. member for the West Riding spoke in terms which I thought did him honour, and which, at the same time, rendered a just and merited tribute to the noble viscount, when he described the manner in which mynoble friend usually aails his poltical opponents. I gladly admit -and it is agreeable to me to make the admission at a tiEte when I am objecting to the proceedings of the Governmentthatthe good humour with which the nobleviscountaaddres this House is such that it disarms resentment even when he utters what from the mouth of other men would sound like strong reproaches. I am sure that my noble friend used the alleged combination as a mere weapon of debate, and without intending to impute that which his words seem to imply. Be that as it may, the noble lord spoke in entire ignorance of the fact if he believed that any combination existed other than a combination in the division lobby. The case as regards my right hon. friends and myself is this Upon the first night of the present session we, like the rest of the House, heard the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckimghamshire make an announcement for which we were not prepared-viz., that he intended to abide by certain principles of finance, and to endeavour to apply them in the regulation of the income and expenditure of the year. Upon the basis of that public declaration, heard by the Government and the House at the same moment as it came to our own knowledge, we supported a motion of the right hon. gentleman, with which our principles wera thoronghly in harmony. That, Sir, is the history of the combination with the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, and in that bistory the whole truth of the case is comprised. (Bear, hear.) Just in the same manner, somewhat later, we saw the hon. member for the West Riding rise from his place, and heard him deliver a notice with regard to the affairs of China, for which we were equally unprepared, but with the statements contained in which we thoroughly and cordially agreed. In consequence of that concurrence we gave to the hon. member the best support we could in public debate; and I should like to know whether we should not have been guilty of a breach of public duty, both in the one case and in the other, if, with the convictions we entertained, we had thought for a moment of pursuing any other course? (Hear.) Our opinions are before the country. Whatever may be said of us, at least it will be admitted that we have never shrank from statingl them openly in this House. Our opinions with respect to taxation and expenditure have been so clearly declared in the course of the present session, that there [can be no doubt about them. By those opinionsnot in harmony I am sorry to, say with the corse of the Government, but strictly in harmony, as we believe, with the interests of the country-we mean to abide, whatever may happen in the vicissitudes of public life. That is a duty due from us to public principle; I leave it to the hon. member for West Norfolk to consider whether it entirely corresponds with all that his lively and vigorous imagination has led him to apprehend. (A laugh.) Before sitting down I am bound to state that with respect to the finances of the country I am left entirely in the dark by what, I suppose, I must in courtesy call the statement of the noble lord at the head of the Government. He intends, as I understood him, to take certain taxes for the year, and the estimates and the Mutiny Bill for part of the year. I should have been glad to give to the Government the best information I could with respect to my own course if the noble viscount had been more minute in the information he afforded us. A Committee of Ways and Means stands for to-morrow, and I myself have given notice of a motion which I intend to make in that committee. I am bound to say that nothing which has happened yet induces me to believe that there wll be any cause for this House, during the remaining term of its existence, to relax any part of its vigilance as regards the taxation and expenditure of the country. My own courmse will depend upon what may be said by the noble lord at the head of the Government ; but, at the same time, with a view to an appeal to the country, I am ready to join with the right hon. gentleman opposite in affording every facility for the despatch of necessary public business. (Hear, bear.)
Mr. T. DUNCOMBE-The speech of the right hon. gentleman who has just sat down seems really meant to mystify the House on this question. He has stated that the condemnatory resolution, moved by the hon. member for the West Riding out of a sincere regard for his old friend Sir J. Bowring after an intinacy of 20 years (laughter), is now the solemn judgment of the House Well, if I understand the noble lord the Prime Minister rightly, it was from that solemn judgment he was about to appeal to the country. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman says, " Look at the contents of the division list," but what did he say of the oontents I The only portion of the contents he introduced to the notice of the House was the noble lord the member for the city of London; and the righthon. gentlemansaid,-"Fancyappealing tothe country against that noblelord's decision I" ("Hear," and laughter.) Nevertheless, the noble lord at the head of the Government is going to appeal against this, I will not call it combination, but this union of parties that met in the lobby the other evening (cheers and laughter); and it is a remarkable coincidence that the same sort of motion as was proposed here should have been made by the leader of the Opposition party in the House of Lords about the very same time. WelL the noble lord at the head of the Government naturallythink s that this motion of the bon. member for the West Riding, having been sapported by the right hon. gentleman the leader of the Opposition and his friends, supported too by those gentlemen who are known generally throughout
the country as belonging not only to the Manchester school, but to the peace-at-any-price party, and supported also by those who were the former adherents of Sir Robert Peel and the formor colleagues of the preeent Prime M1inister-the noble lord naturally thinks that it does look something like a combination of parties thathasdefeated him. (Hear.) " Look at the contents of the division list," and I say that the noble lord the Prime Minister is perfectly justified by those contents in appealingto the country. (Hear, bear.) Those who represent the largest constituencies will be found on his side. Out of 15 metropolitan members (laughter from the Opposition)-aye, laugh at the metropolis if yon like; but out of 15 metropolitan members 12 votedinthe minority with the Prime Ainister, and three in the majority. Take the West Riding. What happened there? Certainly the hon. gentleman the present member (a laugh) for the West Riding moved the resolution to which I have just alluded; but I understand he is about to quit the West Riding. (Hear, hear.) What did the other member do? Why he voted against his hon. collesgue. (Hear, hear.) What have some of the largest towns done through their representatives ? You laughed at the metropolitan members; now laugh at these if you lke. LAugh at the members for Birmingham and Leeds. (Hear, hear.) Then I say thatthe right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghasnshire and those gentlemen who met together in the lobby the other evening are not likely to meet again in the lobby on this quesiion, because, as the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire said, the noble lord at the head of the Government baa dealt
most fra-ldy, fairly, and honesty by the House. (Hear, hear.) The gentlemen on the benches near me (alluding to the plas occpied by L-. Cobden, Mr. Gladstone, sad others) say that the noble lord at the head of the GoTernmnent bag acted most disingenuonsly; and the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford University exclained, "We mustforcehimtosaymore, andmusthavethequestion answered, 'Do you mean to reverse the poliEcy you have been pursuing in China?" Why, the noble lord has told you he does not (cheers); and he says he believes that the counttYthinks him right inno' reversing that policy. (He"r.) And why is the country of that opiudon? Bcause it believes that the noble lord w maintain the nationaIl honour, and is determined not to permit treaties to be evaded with impunity. (Hear, hear.) So the Prime Minister says to the country, "Judge among the different parties in this House which Administration you would hk-e best; whether the present, pursuing a hlberal foreign policy (laughter from the Opposition), or a Government which will give you peace at say price, and wllbe supported by right hon. gentlemen fonnerly colleagues of the noble lord and members of Lord Aberdeen's Administration?' The people wIll ask themselves this question -" Did we applaud the policy recommended by those right hon. gentlemen in reference to the war with Russia ? (Cheers.) If their dvice had been followed where should we have been now ? (Cheer) Where would have been the peace -a peace which, though not all that Englisbmen desired, is yet a peace of honour in comparison with what they would have got at the hands of those right hon. gentleman (renewed cheers), or, as far as we know, at the hands of the noble lord the member for London ? We are all pe1eetly well aware that the noble lord the member for Lon. don was a British lion here at the table of this House, bat at Vienna he wasx a spnieL (oud chee.) Becolect the advice given by the right hon. gentleman themeaber for Oxford University with respect to the RusBian war. He said that that was a wicked war, and advised you to retrace your steps. (Ciies of "oN," and - Hear.")
Mr. GLADSTONE here rose amid cries of "Order I
He said that he believed he was in order in rising to contradiet the assertion just made. It w anentire and abolute, though doubtless an involuntary, misstatement Hehad often said directly the reverse. (Hear, bear.)
Mr. DUNCOMBE.-I am not taldng of what the right kon gentleman said to-night. Did he not say that it was
war in whichl England ought not to have entered; and that the Emperor of Russia ought to be reimbursed for his expenses? (LAughter, during which Mr. Gladstone rose, and was understood to deny the statement.) I certainly must have misunderstood the right hon. gentleman if he really approved the war at the time of the discussion which took place after the return of the noble lord the member for London from Vienna. (Rear, hear.) It was on that occasion that the right hon. gentleman, though having belonged to Lord Aberdeen's Government-and here is the inconsistency of his conduct as understood by the public, and he ought to be oblged to me for clearing it up-did disapprove the manner in which the war was carried on, though that was a war agreed to under the Aberdeen Government, (Cheers.) Then with regard to the right hon. member for Wiltshire-but I suppose I am wrong here also (a Ixugh)-I understood him in that very discussion, when the noble lord the member for London returned from Vienna, and when we debsted the " four points," to say that we ought to have been satisfied with the two points which the noble lord and the conference had agreed to (" No ! no F%) and ought not to have insisted °n the remainingttwo. Do you men todenythat ? ("Hear, hear," ana laughter.) Well, at all events, he said we ought to have been satisfied with three points. (Benewed laughter) Such was that right hon. gentleman's policy with regard to the war. (Hear, hear.) Then there is the right hon. gentleman the member for Carlisle. (Laughter, cries of "Question I" and cheers.) It is now said that the present Government has no policy. What was his policy? I remember that right hon. gentleman concluding a speech by saying that we should not "drive Russia to the wall." Why, what was the object of the war but to "drive Russia to the wall," and we did it (cheers), and got a peace, efficient in some respects though not in all, but very different from that which those right hon. gentlemen would have got if they had continued to have the administration of affairs. (Cheers.) Then I say that the noble lord the Prime Minister will, with respect to his foreign policy, meet with the support of the people during the appeal he is about to make to the country. (Cheers.) Withrespectto his domestic policy (hear), of course he must make more decided terms with the Liberal party. (Ironical cheers from the Opposition.) He has not said that he is against all reform, and the Bill which the noble member for Londoa introduced in 1854 met with the concurrence of the noble lord now at the head of the Government. Therefore, I do not see that any one has a right to say that the present Prime iMinister is against all reform; but the right hon. gentleman opposite, if he gets inta office, wil give us no reform. (Hear, hear.) Then I think that the noble lord has nothing to fear from any of these parties; and if he wil only continue that course, and will proclaim to the country that he wil maintain the honour of our national fig, and that he wil not allow treaties to be violated with impunity, I say that be may defy that petty jealousy by which he is saurronded here (cheers), and set at nought that misrepresentation to which he is exposed elsewhere; beause he wi receive tbe support of a vast majority of that large community whose Interests are committed to his care, and who Wil not allow those interests to be sacrificed either to unprincipled combinations and cabals, or to mere acddental meetings in the lobbies. (Cheers.)
Sir J. GRAHAM-I should have thought, Sir, that the present debte had been suffiiently wide and desultory without needlessly introducing into it the point which my hon. friend who has just sat down has thought fit to introduce with respect to the conduct and commencement of the Russian war. But he has, unintentionally, no doubt, Eo misrepresented what has fallen upon former occasions, both from myself and from my two right hon. friends who sit near me, that I cannot allow this debate to close without offering a few words in explanation. My two right hon. friends and myself were the colleagues of the noble viscount and of the right hon. gentleman near him on the Treasury bench at thetimeof thedeclaration ofthatwar, and we believed it to be a just and necessary war. We so declared it from the very commencement and during its pr gress, and from that declaration and opinion we have never varied. (Hear, hear.) Together with the noble viscountk when we were his collesgues for a short time after the fall of the Aberdeen Administration, we wereparties tosending my noble friend the member for London to negotiate a peace; and so far from driving Russia to the war we were parties to the instructions which were givren to that noble lord with reference to the negotiations at Vienns. My two right hon. friends and mnyself, who still retain the opinion that peace with Rusia might have been honourably and advantage. ously concluded in conformity with those instructions, coincided in the opinion with the noble lord who attempted to negotiate that peace, and with the noble viscount the First Lord of the Treasury, who not only was a party to those instructlons, but who was at the head of the Administration when they were framed (hear, hear); and I munt observe, if we are to try either the negotiationsat Vienna or the conclusion of peace by the question whether Russia was driven to the war, that it moat be remembered that that peace w concluded with the fort of Sebastopol still in herpos sesSion, and with her power, somewhat broken, It is true, in the Blak Sea, but by no means impaired by any concessions which she had made. So much with regard to the Russian war. I may now, perhaps, be permitted very shortly to express my opinion with regard to the main subject under discussion. My noble friend the member for London has referred to the "penal dissolution" of Parliament, And it cannot for a moment be doubted that the threatened dissolution is of a penal character. A dissolution of that descziption s resisted by Mr. Fox, who so desigated a dissolution of this nature, to the last extremity -even L--- to hepasin of the Mun Bill but wihl
-even to the psemsg of the bfuntiny' BE ; but, with all respect to that great constitutional authority, I do not think that the precedent is one which ought to be fol-
lowed. That resistance was pushed, as I have said, to the blst extremity, but Mr. Fox, and those who acted with him, ilthough they constituted the majority of this House, seeing the inevitable confusion and mnischief to the State which was likely to result from their continued
opposition, at lst gave way, and allowed the Mutiny Act to be passed. The consequence was to give to their opponent, lMr. Pitt, an immense advantage-it placed him in power,
and lost to that party, of which Mr. Fox was the distinguished leader, a great portion of the trength and emimence which until the dimolution that paty had enjoyed. I therefore think. both on coustitutionul grounds and with
reference to example, that any such opposition to the passing of the Mutiny Bill ought carefully to be avoiaed (hear, hear); nd I, for one, entirely concar in the course which has been proposed by the noble lord, and in thinldng that every fadility should be given for passing the Mutiny Bill for a period limited to less than one year. Bet, as the Mutiny
Bill is necessrily based upon the number of men to be
voted by this House, I may probably be allowed, though somewhat prematurely, to express my opinion with reference to the amount of the force proposed. As regards the army, I personally entertain the opinion that the amount
of that frce is larger than can he required, considering the a-ate of proround peace which now happily exists in Europe and all over the world, with the exception of Persa and China; but if we are driven to vote that force with refe. reOce to continued hoatilities iu the East, evan sthomgl we are a moribund Parliament, I should prefer being precluded
frGm the naeeity of -votig an additionl umber heroafte. It must be remembered, too, that the force votod is a =zimnume force, and, as the Mutiny Bill for the army must be baed upon some definite ncmber, I should for a time, to bo limited, be willing to give my consent to the force proposed, alys asming that it wi be perfectly open to the new Parlimeznt to reoonsider the number of men. (Hosr.) But this brings me to a point on which I foel the utmost practical difficulty, andl trustthat the noble lord in his reply willgive us some cleLrer notion than he has yet done of the paliey which he intends to pursue with respoct to taLxation. (Cheers.) While we differ in many other particulars, I think that we are all apreed in this-that In justice to the taxpLyes of this country no advantage shall be taken of the technical ground on which it might be proposed to insist upon the exaction of Is. 4d. in the pound, the wxr amount of the tax afecting incomes, for the year from April, 187, to April, 1S58. (Cheer) It mat be observed with regard to this particular pieoe of war taxation that it is compoaed of two different items-onea 9d. added sbortly after the commenooment of the war, the other an item of 2d., also of a wr character, making in a lld., which was propond ,nd sactioned in consideration of the rar; so that if the law as it now exigtgwerenotmainhitedinitstmot rigour the principle which ought to come into operation on the 5th of April next wouldbe the reduction of the tax from that period to April, 1860, to 5d. in the pound. (Hoar, beer.) The great question, then, wil arise before PariL. ment dissolves, and it Is impossible for ns to evade it, what sball be the amount of inoone-tax to be leried for the ensuing year? Tht' quesion must be gravely considered with refrence to the eXpediture of the State and to the policy of theGovernment, and it cannot be considerod apart from the question of Persia and the Chinese war. Another question sho, hardly lees important, upon which discussion cannot be avoided, aries out of the circumstance thxt 4,500,00ML of arrears of war Income-tax will have to be levied betwoeen the 5th of April and the 6th of October. and that that sum having by the decision of Parliament been appropriated to the extinction of the debt of 16,000,ODOL of Exchequer-bills, it is sought by the Government to apply it to the expenses of the current year, by a departure from tkepolicy which was confimed by thhi Hono in the moet deliberte manner. I imagine that these questions must be decided, and that they cannot be postponed. (Helr, hear.) So, alo, witbh respect to the tea duty, which stands for discussion to-morrow night. If the law be left to take its course, the duty upon tea will not exoced is. 3d. per lb. from the 5th of April next, but the Government now proposn a considerble augmentation of that duty. The axme thing applies to the ar duties; and it is for tho Houe to determine, with reference to present circumstances, when we are about to meet our constituents, wbether we shall impose uapon the dirst necesries of life next to bread any additional tax partaking of tho nature of a uwar tx. In passing, I may mention also the spirit duties. An addition was mado to those duties with the sanction of Parliament for a short period only, and it is now sought to render the increased duties permanent. I don't object to that; but I say that thee are questions of finance which must be dealt with forthwith. (Hear, hear.) Now, I think that with reference to the important matters which I have mentioned, some explicit information from the noble lord as to the eourge which he intends to pursue as to taxation would be not only to the oonvenienoe of the House but just to the community whom we represnt. If the noble lord is about to address the House again tonight I hope he will have the kindness to leave no doubt upon our minds in that respect.
Sir J. PAXINGTON.-Ithink tbat what fell from the bon. member for Flnsburylwith respect to the Russian war has been already so clearly dealt with, but what has just been said by the right hon. baronet renders it necesmary that we should receive from the noboe lord opposito aome more distinct information than we have yet had, whetber it is the intention of Her Majests Government to pay any degree of deference to the vote of this House on last Tuesday night (Loud cries of "H ear, hear.") I think it is quite unnecossary, notwithstanding what fell from the hon. member for Finsbury, that I should repeat, or in any way refer to what fell from tho noble lord the member forLondon, or from my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford with regard to the supposed combination of parties which led to the vote of Tuesday night. But I think it most desirable that we should receive from the Govern ment an explanation of their intentions with regard to tho Chinese war (bear, hear), and more especially after the statement of the hon. member for Finsbhuy ;for, if I rightly understood that statement, he understood the langage of the noble lord to-night to mean that the Government do not intend to alter their policy with regard to China in any degree, or to make any change in those hands to which the conduct of our atfairs in China is now intrustd. (Hear, hear.) I fully expected (and that expectation was no doubt entertained bv the great majority of this House) that the noble lord would, on the pert of the Government, announce that it was their intention to appeal to the country; but I at the same time expected that tbat annoncemont would be accompanied by a declaration that tho conduct of our affairs in China is no longer to bo left in thoso unsafe and incompetent hands in which it now is. (Cheers.) I am disposed to infer from the silnce of the noble lord on this subject, followed as it has been by the two evasive speeches of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, that Her Majesty's Government have not yet made up their minds on this subject; but I hope that before this House is called upoa on Friday next to vote supplies in order to facilitate that dissolution which the noble lord has announced he will be prepared to state to the Houso what policy the Government mean to pursue in that roept I am I the more anxious to hear that statement on account of the
extraordinary statement of the Secretary of State for the Home Department with reference to what fell from my right hon. friend the member for Wiltshiro. If I under. stood the Secretary of State for the Home Department correctly, he denied that the hostities in China were caused by a desire to renew and obtdin by force of arms the right to enter into the town of Canton. (Hear, hear.) Now, if that is notwhyvwe are carrying on war in China, I join with my righthon. friend the member for W-iltshire in requesting that we may be informeda s to what it is that wo are fighting for. (Hear, hear.) Then, again, I heard with sur. prise the statement of the right hon. gentleman, that any danger to British life or interests in China is to bo traced to the division of Tuesday night. The xtatements in the pubEc journals of this day show that the deplorable impolicy of the course which has been taken by oar officials in China has so greatly endangerod British lives and British interests there tbat it is scarcely possible for them to bo moroeendangered by our voto on Tuesday night. Let me say, in fairness to the Government, that I am quito willing to believe the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty, that Her Majesty's Ministers have not been negligent in adopting measurse for the protection of our interests at Canton and Singapore But I submit that after the vote of Tuesday night this declaration is not enough. I think we are fairly entitled to ask-and I am sure that this demand is not inconsistent either with the words or the meaning of the words that fell from my right bon, friend near me as to our willingoess to afford enery assistanoe to Her Mlajesty's Government to prosecute such parts of the pubiEc business as ought to precede that dissolution which has been announced, we are, I say, entitled to ask the noble lord whether the conduct of affairs in China is oris znot to be left in those unsafo and incompetent hands in which they re now plcod ? (Hear, hear.)
Er. W. J. FOX could not sit quiet undor the imputation which had been cast upon him, in common with some other hon. members, as to the vote of Tuesday night-first, by the speech of the noble lord at the head of the Government, and next by that of thno hon. member for ESnsbury. He repelled the accation that he was influenced by anything lke party spirit in joining in that rote. He thought that it was one of the mots unjust impatations ever made in that House (Cheers) He protested against the attempt of the noble lord at the head of the Government to send those who were
parties to that vote back to their oonstituents with the brand upon them that they voted for a Coalition in order to upset his Government. That imputation was unjust, bemcuse a great number of those who supported the motion of the hon. member for the West Riaing had been in the habit of supporting Her Majesty's Government. (Hear, hear.) He (Mlr. Fox) admitted that he bad great difficulty in making up his mind to vote on that occaion, because he did not wish to be in any way auxiliary to the restorationofaDerby Government, whether pure and simple, or in conjunction with any other portion of the members of that House.. (Hear, bear.) Although the noble lord at the head of the Government had in many respects disappointed his expoctations, although he had not adopteda coursewhichmight be expected from the succssor of the rigt Hon.George Canning, the champion of Xuropean liberaBssm-talthongh he had on recent occasions lowered tbe flag of Refom, and throw it into the dust (hear, hear),yet he (Mr. Fox) certainly ws not disposed to give his voice for anything like a restoration of tho Ministry of the hon. gentlemen on the Opposition benches. The hon. mem-
ber for Finsbury had charged him with identifying himself with the pece-at-any-price party by his voto on Tuesday night; but he (Mr. Fox) appealed to the House whether his conduct during the dimcussions and divisions on the Russian war was open to that imputation? He endeavotred sulcce-
fuly during thoae discnssions to invite what was called the ktchester party to sapport the hands of the noble lordinthe war against Ruwia Were be, and those hon. pntlemen who acted with him, liable io the imputations ef the
noble lord and of the lon. momber for Finabury after they had sacrificed those connexions that had been long endeared to them in order to do their dutty to what they beliered to be the bonourand interests of tbeircountryI (Helrbear.) Every feeling by which he was influenced induced him to hesitate alhnt giving his support to the voto of Tcasday night. He had had s lifelong friendship with Sir J. Bowring. He had not only admired in him what all the world admirod-viz., his reat verratility of talent, bat he harl also soen in him sound principles, pure integrity, high-mindod patriotism, and other qualities which would make him most unwilling to give any vote or do xnything which could reflect on his character or hurt his feelings. But he could not give his Sanction to the course to which Sir J. Bowring had been a party in China, as he had always held that privato feelings should not interfere with tho performance of a pablic daty. He believed that Sir J. BDorring had rot acted upon the natural impulse of his own mind, but that he had been induced by the sinister and interested influenoe of =archants, and by the anxiety, perhaps, of military men for something lik-e ction, as vell as by tho stimulmu which ho had received from the Government at home (cheers), to aiopt the course which he had unhappily pursued Under such circumstances, being convinced thbat the motion of the hon. nember for th WeAst Riding was nothing but what was just, and right, and true, he fek bound to sapport it. Bt it vas not for Coalition Gorernment tbht he voted. In the majority on Tuesday night were the representatives of all the different principles held in that House. High Conservatives, extreme RAldicas, those who reproeentod the Old aWhig party, every shade of opinion voted in that majority, and nothing but the force of truth and the power of honest convictions oould have brought them together. (Hear, hear.) He looked back upon tbht voto with entire satisfaction, and 0ould not but feel deeply interested in tho policy which oer Majesty's Government were propred to parsue with reference to China There was no honour to bo obtained in enforcing claims which we had agreed to waive, or which we knew were not founded on truta or justioe. The honcurable course would be at onoo to atop such proooodings
and to ?rochim to the world that this House would be no party to them; that we sought amicablo and commercial intercourse with a poople widely differing from ourselves, but that we respected these differences, and were prepared to violate as little as possible their feelings and their prejudices (Checrs.)
Sir F. BABING was anxious to press tbo noblo lord for an expl'natio' Apon one mnost important point; but, before putting any question, ho must say that he had heard with much pleasure that Her Majesty's Gorernment, haTing decided upon aspealing to tho country, no attompt would bo made by anything like a factious opposition to delay that appeal. (Hear, hear.) From the Ianguago which had been used on all sides of thc Houeo he felt confident thLat this promise would be kept. At tho samo time he did not feel much alarmed at tho cry which was always raised on oeasions similar to this, that thero had been a conspiracy. (Hear, heas.) He would only say that he never came to a vote with more personal pain or after more anxious and arnest inquiry, and he never gare a vote in that louse with a clearer conscience (Hear, hear.) If the time had to come again and it was to be the lst voto which he was to givo in that Houso he would give it with the utmost eordiPlity, he might say, with tho utmost alacrity. (Renewed cheers.) As thoy wlere going to the country upon the question whether the policy of 1ler Majosty's Govern"ent, or rather the pulioy of Sir J. Bowring (hear, hear;. in regard to China had the approval of the nation, he would ask his noble friend whether Sir John Bowring was to cottinue in his present position ? (Hear, hear.) Ho wished to my nothing harsh of Sir John Bowring, but it was strongly impressed upon his mind that so long as the carrying out of the instructions from home was intrusted to his hands, it mattered not what those instructions were or how psaneful might be the tone adopted by Her Majesty's advisers (Hear, heat) One thing was mnost remarkable, that in the lato debate no one except those on tho Treasury bonch, and hardly even they, ventured to defend the course which had been pursued by our representative in China. (Hear, hear.) He thereforo asked whetber, after the vote of that House, this country was to he dragged furthor in order to protect and support Sir John Bowring; and whether Her Majesty's Government not only approved conduct which had been defended by no other member of that House, but intended to continue the same policy by means of the sLme agent ? Although not professing to be a friend of Sir John Bowring, he w-a anxious that for his own sako he should bo removed from his presont position. le blievod that he was a man of comsiderable ability, and should be glad to see him employod in an offioe to which his abilitios wero adapted ; but he did not think that the fortunes of this country, the fate of thousands, and the question of law and peace, could sately bo plsced insuch hands (Cheers.)
Mr. BENTINCK sid that, as tho right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford had attributed certain remarks which he (Mr. Bentinek) had mado on the subject of combinations to his lively imagination, he must receive that statement, as he should any other mado by the right hon, gentloman, with civility, and must adopt what the right hon. gentleman had been pleased to tell the Houso wren his views and knowlodge of the present state of combiations He only regretted that the right hon. gentleman did not go a little further, and teU the House whether he wss not only at this moment willing but anxious to carry those combinations into more substantial effect. If it should ain bo his good fortune to meet the right hon. geatleman in that House ho hoped (without meaning any discourtesy to tho zight hon. gentleman) that they should bo sitting opposite to each other; and he might then, perhaps, have to go further into the subject and t., remind the right hon. gentleman of what had passed that night on the subject of combinations
Lord FALERSTON.-I do not think that tho present Ls an appropriate occasion on which to go into those detailed explanations with regard to taxation and the estimates, wvhich aro desirod by the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle. [Sir J. Graham.-" To-morrow wiU do.") My right hon. friend the ChanceUor of tho Exchequer will give proper notice to-night, and wiU to-morrow, in Committeo of Ways and means, givo every explanation which can be deasired on theos points. A great deal has been said to-night which has moro re.ombled a prolongation of the debato of Tuesday than a debate naturally arising out of tho statement which I had the honour to make. It was not my intention to renew that debate, nor wiU I do so now. Neither will I ba led by the tone which some members have ndoptod towards the Government to forget that good humour which I think ought to characterize the procoedings of this evening. I miust say that in one respect the right hon. gentleman tho momber for the University of Oxford (Mr. Glastone) has to a certain extent negatived the chargo, if he considers it a charge, that he hs combined with the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire. Combination implies a certain degree of similarity and identity of feeling. Now, the righthon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Disraeli), inwhathe stated to the House, spoke with a calmness, a temper, and a statesmanlike view of a great occasion which did honour to himself and to the party of which he is the leader. (Raear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman the membor for the University of Oxford, however, vas carried away by an impotuosity and irritation of mind (a laugh) which cortainly did not betoken any previous conoert with the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, and which will, I think, be considered by him an unfortunate omen for that oo-opera. tion which is to foUow the assUmed combination betwoen them. (Renewed laughter.) I said nothing to-nightwith legard to combination or conspiracy, or anything of the kind which oould give offence to any one. (Hear.) Yom may caU it combination, you may call it the accidental and fortuitous concurrence of atoms (a hlugh); you may call it the accidental meeting of different gentlemen in one lobby ; but I say that when gentlemen aro in the habit of finding themselves in the same lobby it Is not unnatural to suppose thatthey may, under certain circumstanoes, bo rwdy to form an Admninistratlen, and become res;ponsible for thewhhtesvraletrai.Iddntm-
opinions which they severally entertain. I did not mention this sa reproach. On the contrary, I stated it as a fact, and a fact which I thought might not bo inconvenient or injurious to tbo country, tbat there would bo element, for the formation of an ffilcientAdministrtion, if the country should think that the present one was no longer worthy of its confidence and support. Therefore I nkthat much
which has fallen from hon. gentlemen, and especiay from the right hon. gentloman tho member for tho University of Oxford, was not appropriate to this occasion. Bot, Sir, my noble friend the membor for the city of
London is always disposed to follow in tho footsteps of ono for whom he feels respect and veneration, Mr. Fox, and, having discovered a precedent in which Mr. Fox spoke of an appeal to the country as a " penal diasolution," he says
that a dissolution is to bo considered as punishing the Hlouso of Commons for adopting a oertain vote. (Cheer) But, Sir, that is a strange doctrine, if this Rouse is to be rightly corsidered as the true organ of public opinion-if members are supposed to bo speaking hero the sentiments of their constitucncies.

much, Sir, for the dissolution. Well then, Sir, the right Lon. gentleman, among other charges that he makes against the Government, says that they embarked in the Chinese war without the sauction of Parliament. Sir, we never embarked in the Chinese war. (Hear, hear.) I never said
that we had, nor is the right hon. gentleman entitled to say I so. [Mr. Gladstone.-" I said Persia."] I am glad to hear
that, although outwardly and with our ears we seemed to I hear this, yet that it was not in the mind of the right hon. gentleman. This would indeed be a most preposterous charge, seeing, as every one must see, that the Chinese war happened not only without our previous knowledge, but that we were as much susprised at the announcement as
any hon. gentleman who read these occurrences in the papersI almost as soon as we were acquainted -with them by the despatehes. (Hear, hear.) Then I say, with regard to those operations, that the House undoubtedly has a right to ask what has continued and wiU continue to be the policy of the Government. Nor Sir, there will be no change, and can he no change, in the policy of the Government with respect to events in China. The policy of the Government is to maintain in China, as elsewhere, seeurity for the lives and property of British subjects-to maintain the rights of this country as arising out of treaty obligations-to endeavour by negotiations either to improve our existing relations or to restore amicable relations if events have brought about a rupture. It is our duty, therefore, as stated by my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty to take measures and to make every exertion to give all po.ssible security to British residents in China. No man knows better than my right hon. friend the member for Carlisle that that matter requires great consideration and considerable care, for he on a former occasion rather magnified the danger of British subjects in Cbina; and it is clear that from the number of the parties concerned, the interests involved, and the number of the ports at which they are scattered, we do require ample means to provide for their security. A short time before this outbreak occurred we, In conjunction with France, and as we trusted in conjuuction with the United States, by negotiations with the Court of Pekin hoped to improve our commercial Telations with China. Every one knows that if a great extension of commercial intercourse between the nations of Europe and China is ever obtained it will be a great advantage to the cause of civilization, as well as a great benefit to the productive industry of the nations concerned. (Hear, hear.) That, undoubtedly, is a very grave matter, and the difficulty is greatly increased by the unfortun ate events that have occurred; and, without stating to the House anythaing that wil prejudice matters still under consideration, I am bound to say that it will necessarily be the subject of serious deliberation who the person shaU be to whom shall be committed so grave and important a charge. It must strike every one that a person who shaU start from these shores on such a mission should be imbued with the feelings of the Government on this subject, and that, being the recipient of their vorbal instrmctions, he would be likely to carry more weight than any person who might happen now to be in China. (Cheers.) However, in saying that, the House wrill see that I by no means undervalue the merits of Sir J. Bowring, to whom I think the greatest injustice has been done (hear, hear), and whose merits have been disparaged to a degree that has astonish-l me. (Hear.) But, at the same time, the Government c,oaot shut their eyes to the gravity and importance of the matters in hand, and it will be their duty to select for these negotiations, if they take place, some person whom they consider best calculated to carry them to a successful termination. (Cheers.) The House must therefore expect our policy to remain the same; it is to maintain the rights and to defend the lives and properties of British subjects, to improve our relations with China, and, in the selection of those means and the arrangenment of those means, to perform the duty that they owe to the country. (Cheers.)
Mr. SPOONER was of opinion that no consideration ought to be allowed to interrere with the recall of Sir J. Bowring. The noble viscount said Sir John was unjustly used; but what did he say to that false statement in which he declared that the Chinese were perfectly right in what they did-that the Arrow was not entitled to any protection, while a few days afterwards he declared that *be Chinese were wrong? Sir J. Bowvring haddisgraced the character of this country. The noble viscount would never carry with him the confidence of the co untry as long as he maintained in his post an offlcial vwho had disgraced himself by a falsehood, and had put a stain on the British character.
hlr. R. HER said that his duty was to look for Conservatism where he could find it, and if he could find it on the opposite (the Ministerial) ben ches he felt bound to adopt it, anid not to ally himself with parties exhibiting such discor. dant elements as those who opposed the noble lord at the head of the Government. (Hear, hear.)
FINANCIAL PROPOSITIONS OF THE
GOVERNMENT.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEER said that the debate had assumed to so great an extent the charaoter of an adjourned debate upon China that he had abstained from rising at an earlier period. He wished now to give notice that to-morrow he should make the same proposition to the House with regard to the incometax for the ensuing year which he had already announced, omitting, however, any proposal withrespect to the two subsequent years. He did not desire to ask the House to agree to anythiug that'was notneceeasary forthe ensuiDg year, andhe should therefore move to-morrow for the reduction of the iacome-tax for the next year from 16d. to 7d. for incomes above 1601., and to 5d. for incomes between 1501. and 1001. It would be unnecessary to propose a resolution in Ways and Means, as no new charge would be laid on, and tomorrow he would move for leave to bring in a Bill to carry out the proposition he had mentioned. With regard to tea and sugar, he should confine his proposals to the next current year, and he should move to-morrow the rates of duty that he proposed to adopt for next year.
Sir J. GRAIHAM took it for granted that the Chancelor of the Exchequer would not divide the House to-morrow night on these proposals.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER proposed to go into Ways and Means to-morrow upon the sugar duties, and to make this the first order.
Mr. GLADSTONE could not suppose his right hon. friend intended to move at night the resolutions he had placed in the hands of members only the same morning, Such a course would be entirely contrary to Parliamentary usage.
The CHANCELLOR the EXCHEQUER would not press his msotion to-morrow night if he thougkt it would be regarded as a surprise, buthe didnot proposeanydeviation from 1he scheme he had already announced, with one slight exception. He proposed that the duty cpon tea should be Is. 5d. next year, and that the sugar duties should remain exactly as they stood for the ensuing year. As this was proposing no material change he did not see how his right hon. friend could assume that the House would be taken by surprise.
Mr. GLADSTONE submitted that the proposal as to the tea daties was really the corner-stone of the whole matter. (" Order !")
The SPEAIKER said the right hon . gentleman might put a question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but there being no mo'tion before the House ho must go on with the paper of the day. After the right h on. gentleman's question was put it would not be competent for him to make a speech when there was no motion before the House.
'The subject then dropped.
TIE LANID-TAX.
Mr. MACKINNON, in moving for a select committee on tbe laud-tax, stated that while in France and Belgium a similar tax was raised with justice and impartiality in Great Britain the levying it was attended with great injustice and inequality. In his opinion it obght to be remodeled and further redemption permitted.
As an itustration of the gross inequalities attendiDg the land-tax assessment, he might mention that the whole of the wealthy and populous to rn of Liverpool was rated at the sum. of only 991. a-year, whereas a miserable and thinly inhabited rural parish in Suffolk was assessed at 1981. per annum. The cause of this monstrously unjust state of things was that the old assessment, made 180 years ago, in the reign of William and Mary, was still adhered to, and tbe growth of some ulaces, and the decay of other were entirely excluded from consideration. When Mr. John Wocd. late Chairman of the Inland Revenue Board, and hr. Garnett, seretary to the Land-tax Commisaioners, were both examined before a committee of that House, they advocated a change in the system, and showed that while one class of towns was free from all asessment to the land-tax, othershad to pay at the rate of 15 per cent. of their inoome. The fact was, that the rich towns either wholly escaped or had only to contribute half-a-farthing in the pound,andtheunfortmatepoorparsbeshadto contribute
3:. to 3S. 6d. in the pound. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving for a select committee t consider the expediency of allowiog a further redemption of lnd-tax, and also whethe by any other means this tx might obe made more beeneficial to the revenue of the country and to the reduction of the national debt,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thought the hon. member, in reeking a further redemption of the landtax. had undertaken a more difficult task than he was
perhapa aware of. Bat, at all events, alter the announcement made earlier in the evening respecting the present gaste of public affairs, little benefit could he derived from nowr agreeing to this motion. Be (thse ChanceIlor of the Exche quer) had to attend the sittings of the Ban} Charter Os,ln,uttec and other insoiytatit inquiries, and the time of hila hon. friend the Secretary to the Treasury was equally occupied. Moreover, under the circuustnces of the ion an inivestigation like the one n'w prop could hrdy be prosecLtea witn advantage, and he bged therefore to aug.
gest that the hon. rcember should postpone his proposition to a more favourable occasion.
Mr. BENTINCK thought the question urgently demanded the interyention of the Legislature, but admitted that in the present moribund state of the House it could not be dealt with with any chance of saucess.
Nlr. MACKINNON' consented for the present to with. draw his motion, hoping to have a future opportunity of again bringing it forward.
The motion was withdrawn accordingly.
JUDGMENTS EXECUTION, &c., BILL.
Mr. CRitAUFURD moved that the order for proceeding with the committee on this bill be discharged, observing that it was his intention to have accepted the aniendment of the Attorney-General, awhea the events of the last few days occurred and induced him to abandon his measure for the present.
Motion agreed to.
The Commissioners of Supply (Scotland) Act (1856) Amendment Bill passed through committee.
An hon. MEiIBER here moved that the House be counted, and, tbere being onlv 28 members present the House adjourned at five minutes past 8 o'clock.

The Defeat Of The Ministry.
THE DEFEAT OF THE MI2NISTBY.
LIVERPOOL MARoi r,.
This afternoon an address to Lord Palmerston, of which the sobjoined is a copy, was placed in the Underwriters' and Exchange rooms, and speedily received a large number of signatutes from gentlemen of all shades of political opinious:-
" To the Right Hon. Lord Palmerston, &c.
"We, the undersigned residents of Liverpool, beg to assure your lordship that we have leamed with feeUngs ot sunrpse and regret the result of the debate on ICr. Cobden's motton in the House of Coonmono
on Tuesday e-oniug. and at the same time to express the ;reat conS. dence we enterta;z. in the efficiency and vigour of your kdmlnistratien at home and abroad.
'The incongruouzs and factious coaUtion In Parliament which has made the present unfortunate state of matters in Ohina the pretext for disrlaciug your Government, vil mee; with lttle sympathy in the country, and eve are anxious to take an early oportunity of as suring youtr loraoblp of our sincere hope that the result may be more firml to estabhlib the power ;on hare wielded for the beet interesta of the empire."
Up to 4 o'lock the address had received some thousand signatures, and people representing all classes of society were then crowding to the table anxious to attach their nanies.
(BY ELXCTrIC TELXGBRAPH.)
The address was forwarded to London by the express train. When the gentleman in whose charge the address has been placed was leaving the room for the purpose of proceeding to the train three enthusiastic cheers were given for Lord Palmerston.
NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 5.
The Ministerial defeat has caused considerable sensation in Nottingham. The electors generally have been well satisfied with the policy of Lord Palmerston, and on the raotion of Tuesday night hail with satisfaction the names of their two representatives in the minority. An election at the present timne would seriously affect the Nottingham trade. In the event of an appeal to the country there is no reason to suppose that there would be any real contest for the borough. Ernest Jones declared some time ago that he should come forward at the next general election, but, as the supporters of that gentleman among the constituency are very few, there is no doubt, should he go to the poll, of his defeat. Among the electors belongingto the Nonconformist body there is a division of opinion, and possibly a candidate may be found less liberal in his religious opinions than br. Paget, bat his success would be exceedingly doubtful.
OXFORD, MAtcH 5.
The intelligence of Lord Palmerston's defeat has produced the greatest excitement in this city. The conduct of Mr Cardwell in voting against the Government is very warmly canvassed, and expressions of dissatisfaction are heard on all sides. A placard, of which the following is a copy, has just been issued:-
" It being certain that the unprincipled coalition in the Houte of Commons will produce an early dissolution of that body, you are earnestly requested not to promiseyour votes, as a gentleman of thoroughly independent English priucililes will be brought forward in opposition to Mr. Cardwell."
The placard emanates from some of the right hon. gentleman's former supporters, and it is fully expected that in the course of a few days a new candidate will be in the field.
DERBY.
It was expected that from the combination of parties the division would be a close one, bht neither Whigs, Tories, nor Radicals anticipated a defeat of the Government. The feeling among all classes except the Peace Party is one of great indignation against all who joined the coalition leaders. As in the country, so in Derby, " the people do not love coalitions."
NEWCASTLE.ON.TYNE, MARCH 4.
The majority against the Ministry was telegraphed down here this morning, and has caused great excitement in commercial circles all day. A very unanimous opinion prevails that it has been brought about by a factious combination of parties. There is no question that the great proportion of the manufacturing and maritime classes in this great district sympathize with Lord Palmerston in the present crisis, and will moet certainly sustain bim in case of a general election. In the two large seaports of Shields, where Lord Derby has generally reckoned a number of supporters, the shipowners are indignant with the Tories, for many of them have sailed upon the Chinese seas and know the character of the officials of that country.

LONDON, FBIDAY. MARCH 6, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
The Earl of CLARENDo.N explained the reasons wby Admiral SiorR had thought it necessary to withdraw from the Dutch Folly Fort, near Hongkong. The noble loTd at the same time stated, that reinforcements of ships and troops had been forwarded to the Chinese waters.
Earl GRAXVrLLvE stated the circumstances which had induced the Govemnment to resolve on a dissolution of Parliament as soon as the necessary acts of the Legislature had been passed in almost the same words as were used by Lord PAL3MRSTON in the other House.
Lord GnEY made some observations in reply, urging that Sir JoHN- Bows.LNG should be recalled.
Some other business was then despatched, and their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons,
Lord PALAMnISTOX said, the House would naturally expect, after what had passed on Tuesday night, that he should state the course which, on due re-
flection, HEan MA.Trsrf's Mhinisters intended to I pursue. After the House had, by a combination of parties, affirmed a resolution which was avowed to be meant as a vote of censure, under ordinary circurnstances they could hardly have any alternative but to tender to the SovnEBiGX the resignation of their offces. But the present case seemed to be of so peculiar a character that they had felt it to be their dutynotto submittheir resignations, butto advise the CRowN, atthe earliest period which the state of business before the House would permit, to call upon the constituencies to exercise the right which the Constitution placed in their hands. It was vain to deny that the vote of Tuesday rendered it very difficult, if not unseemly, for any Govemrnent to conduct the business of the country, in the state of parides which the vote indicated, throughout the session. This was a very old Parliament; it had seen three Administrations, a transition from profound peace to a great European war, and from that war to peace again. The state of public business did not allow an immediate dissolution. The Estimates had not been voted, taxes were to be imposed, and the Mutiuy Act had not passed. Wbat he proposed therefore was a course which had been adopted on a previous and ainilar occasion-namely, to be content with provisional and temporary measures, to continue taxes which ad been voted for three years only for the ensuing year, to vote sums on account of the Estimates, and to continue the Mutiny Act for a portion of the year, leaving other matters to the new Parliament, which would assemble in May.
Air. DISr.AELI thought the course proposed by Lord PALamsTrox would be most to the public adv antage, and he would, he said, give every facility in his power to the progress of business. He believed that the appeal to the country would prove of great beneft to the public interests, and he trusted mnembers would be returned with fnore definite opinions.
Mylr. CoBDEX observed that the House on Tuesday had come to a solemn vote which had been entirely ignored by Lord PALwz1ssrox, and ho asked him what he was gomg to do in consequeno of that vote ? The Executive Government had no right to hold office unless they were prepared to carry it out. If any danger to the British residents in China was to be apprehended from the vote, the first consideration of the Government ought to be the safety of our fellow-countrymen, and they should send a competent person by the next steamer, armed with full power to supersede all existing British authority in China, and to act according to circumstances. If Lord PAaxzrsxoN did not mtend to take this course, what other course would he take? A new Parliament could not assenble until the end of May, and what would be doing in China m the meanwhile ?
Sir C. WooD said it was not his intention to reopen the question. He asured the House that efficient measures had been taken to collect a sufficient force to protect the Bdtish residents in China.
After some observations by Sir J. WjSs and
MIr. DE1DES,
MIr. S. HxnzRRT inquired whether the Government were going to continue the war for the same object-namely, the entry of Sir JoHN Bowrn;o into Canton, and whether the conduct of affairs there was to be left in the hands of a man who, in the opinion of the House, had brought about the present dangerous state of things?
Sir G. GnEY denied that the object of the war was to obtain an entry into Canton. The Government, he said, had directed its most serious attentioa to the existing state of things in China, mad
would take every precaution to protect British lives and property; but they did not intend to send out civil and military officen to act in accordance with
the views of Mtr. COBDEN, who had no right to I assume that they had any other intention than to endeavour to place our relations with China on a proper footing. To aooomnplish this object, they ,would employ the means beat calculated, in their opinion, to do so; and he trusted that the House would leave the honour and the interests of the country in their hands,
Lord J. Russm.L considered that the House was entitled toask for anexplanationof the policyintended to be pursued durmg the next three months after it had determined that conduct which had been approved by the Government was worthy of its censure. Ministersshould state the terms thatwere to be asked of China-what, in fact, was the object of the hostilities. He declared the charge against him of combination with tho Conservative party to be false and calumnious. The concurrence, he said, was on the merits of the question: and he believed that no vote would confer more honour than that of Tuesday upon the Parliament of 1852.
Mlr. RoEBucxi rose to protest against the statement of Lord PAilRrsTON that his vote was the result of a combination, by which he meant conspiracy of parties. Hle k-new nothing of any combination of parties, but voted as he did because he considered the honour of the country endangered by the policy of the Government. A set of men had disgraced England, and these men were supported by the Govermment.
After a few words by MIr. JA3ms AI'GRFsO
IIIr. GLADSTONE asked, if we were not maldng war to obtain the admission of Sir Joiry BowRuIN into Canton, for what Were we at War ? Three months would elapse before Parliament could reassemble, and upon whose policy were the measures in China to be carried on during that interval t Tho House was bound, he said, to require an answer to this question. It w-aa not right to vote supplies for carrying on a war which had been condemned by Parliament; yet it had been distinctly indicated that it would be carried on just as if the resolution had never been adopted. Lord Par.
inX_sTO-, hadtalked of a combination ; when had it before happened that a case was so strong as to compel the House to interpose in order to check the madcareer of theGovernment in another quarter of the globe? Overruling necessity had altered usage, and the Division comprised the names of Lord J. RusaxaL. who had led the Liberal party during more than 20 most eventful year., and Mr. RoEBuCX, no political enemy of Lord PAWLERSTrOx.
Mr. T. DuNco-nBE said, the noble lord was going to appeal against, if not a combination, a strange union, of parties, and he was justified by the Division lists, where were to be found voting in the minority 12 out of the 15 metropolitan members, a member for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and members for Birmingham, Leeds, and LiverpooL The noble lord had said he did not mean to act upon the vote. After some sharp censures upon the foreign policy of the late Administration MIr. DuIcoesmE expressedhis conviction that, if Lord P,%Lmu sroN proclaimed to the country that he would maintain the honour of the national flag, he might defy the petty jealousy by which he was surrounded and set at naught unprincipled cabals.
Sir J. GRAHAr defended the foreign policy of Lord ASE5DEEN'S Government, and requested some explanations upon the sabject of the finances.
Sir J. PANrGTow pressed the Government to say whether they intended to carry out the resolution, and whether the conduct of affairs in China was to be left in unsafe and incompetent hands.
Mr. Fox repelled the accusation of being actuated by party spirit in his vote. Nothing, he said, could be more alien to his feelings and sentiments.
Sir F. BAxu;o pressed tbe inquiry, which he considered a most imrportant one, whether Sir Jornx Bowrrxs,-whose conduct, he said, had been defended by none except on the Treasury bench, and hardly there-was to continue in his present situation.
Mr. Bis-rINcK made a short reply to remarks which had faUen from NIr. GLADsToNE.
LordPALM.%zRsToN said, it was not his intention to renew the debate upon this subject. With regard to the expression he had used of " combination," he had said nothing which, he thought, could give offence to any man. Whether it was a combination or an accident-a fortuitous concurrence of atoms -he had stated it as a fact, not as a reproach. The House, he admitted, had a right to ask what was intended to be the policy of the Govermnent. There would be no change, and could be no change in that policy, which was tO maintain in China,as elsewhere, security to the lives and property of British subjects and the rights of the country arising out of treaty obligations, and to improve our relations with China. The intention of the Governmnent, as he had stated on Tuesday, was, in conjunction with France and the United States, to endeavour to place those relations upon a permanent footing, and it must be a subject of serious deliberation on the part of the Government who the person should be to whom was to be committed so grave and important a function.
After some further discussion the subject dropped.
The CHAXCTort of the ExcHo4uxu stated the course he proposed to pursue, in the Committee of Ways and Means this day in relation to the taxes.
MIr. MAc-xnUox moved for a select committee to consider the expediency of allowing a further redemption of the land-tax; but, the CHANCELLOn of the EXCHEQuER objecting, he withdrew the motion.
The House was disposing of some further business when it was counted out at five minutes past 8 o'clock.
The Coalition has lost no time in announcing a
The Coalition has lost no time in announcing a policy so far as regards the question on which it has formed itself. Lord Gnzy in the Upper House, and Iessrs. COBDEN, GLADSTON-, and others in the Lower, demanded that, without waiting for the appeal to the country, Government should immediately execute the orders of the House of Commons, by sending out a competent person to catch the Indian mail, and supersede all the British authorities on the coasts of Chins. It is hard to say whetler the demand was oddest in the mouth of Lord GBEY, who called on a large majority of the House of Lords to 'render instant submission to a smaU minority of the Commons, or in the mouth of MIr. Cor.DRN, denouncing Government as murderers if they gave one more hour's law than they could possiblyavoid to his old fnend the President of the Peace Society. We are thanhful for the suggestion, as it will help the country to understand the position of Government on the receipt of the late news. It is scarcely possible to form even a conjecture as to the state of affairs at this moment in the East, stil less what will be the state of affairs six weeks hence, when the mail now going out wi arrive at Hongkong. By way of an estimate, Mr. COBDEX says :-" Judging from "the newspapers of what is going on in " China, at Hongk-ong, and Singapore, I think " that before any news of Tuesday night's " division arrives out there the mischief wiU " have been about as great as it can be." He also assumes what, according to Sir CsrLtxs WOOD, he is perfectly justified in assuming,-that a very large force will by that time be aembled at Eonglkong. Here, then, is a great change in the situ-ation of affairs, both for worse and for better, and, when inevitable accidents are taken into account, the boldest will shrinkJ from any attempt at minute anticipation. Ministers are then enjoined and adjured to send out at once a man to supersede all the authorities on the spot, to deprive us instantly of their better information and dearly-bought experience, and to undertake the lead in affairs to which he may be perfectly nevw, but which yet may requiro immediate action. lie may find the efforts of our countrymen crowned with success; he may find that the command has already devolved upon other hands ; he may findwhat is but too likely-that the conduct of the Chinewe has been so atrocious as tD leave absolutely no salternative but their reduction and punisbhment. This, indeed, wo fully beUeve will be the msm in the end; but, if it be so, axc if our newly-arriuea Commander-ix-Chief finds it so on his arzi-s, we cannot see 3ow he will 1o able to carsy out the policy, wbhbever it be5 a th e present. 7mliazen-

for taking a businesslik-o view of tho question, but we cannot otherwise satisfy our own instincts of patriotism, justice, and truth. It is a matter of business, and we have to consider probabilities, ax well as time, space, and other circumstances, quite as much as if we were consigning s miscellaneous cargo to an agent at Melbourne. As a matter of business it compela us to admit another important consideration. We will honestly say that, considering the four persons at the head of our affairs at Canton do at all events know something about them, and one of them, at least, has everybody's good word, we ahould find some difficulty in the choice of a man undoubtedly qualified to relieve them of their duties. Wlhere in the world is this perfectly competent, universally qualified, and absolutely trustworthy mai to be found I Mr. Connr cooperated with Sir Jon-. BoWvtnG for many years, and not only whole elases of merchants, but distinguished politicians, and, more than all, the Peacemakers of England, put the utmost confidence in this gentleman, of whom we all know as much as it is possible to know of anybody. Ho was not a mere talker, for he was but an indifferent one ; nor was he an aristocrat; but a man after M1r. Cosir.%'s own heart. Yet even this man, after being Consul some years, and after devoting himself to the study of Cbinese affairs, is declaredtobe unfit for the conductof our cause. The same is said of Admiral Sir Al. SEYIoo% 7i, thonghhe is so able and excellent a man thathis friends try hard to insulate him from Sir Jo7r- BoirnGs. 'onsul PAsRKs, too, notwithstanding great abitty and zeal, is also eonsigned to the same category of unfitnes. Yet lIr. CODDE andhis colleagles would have us believe that in spite of all these lamentable failures we halU have no difficulty in finding a man so competent as to do single-handed, and at a momenfts warning, What all these able and zealous men cannot do after many years' esperience. Did we find it so easy in the late war with Russia ? Public opinion pointed to Sir CHARLES NAriER for the Baltic. Writh what result? RA7LAiv, S"rPso._, CODntsNGTON, were successively the perfectly competent men to wlhonm England was ready to trust her army and her honour. WVe might have done Worse, indeed; but the result was not satisfactory, even though in each instance the choice was neither hasty nor blind. But now in hot haste we are to find in the streets of London a man to represent the Britissh empire and to w-ield its destinies in the -whole of the opposite hemisphere at a crisis of excessive difficulty, Because Government has not done this, a dozen leading politicians have agreed to charge it with violence to the Constitution, and we know not what; and the foremost in this advice is a man who wants to send out anybody, any unknown person, to supersede a man in whom for many years he himself felt the greatest confidence.
But Government is also, in obedience to the vote of Tuesday, and without wraiting for the decision of the public, to send out a ready-made policy, and the " competent man" is to wield the "immense force" collected at Hongkong to carry out this policy. We are to order the undoing of everything that has been done back to the point where Mr. ConnDa says the affairof the Arrow was satisfied. This proposal appears to have the concurrence of all the other chiefs in the Coalition, and is to go to the country as the policy of the new Administration. The precise meaning of it, even with regard to tho events already known in this country, 'We can hardly imagine. But by the time any orders could possibly arrive out at Hongkong there will be added a whole quarter of a year to the story, all of it, on Mfr. ConDEz%'s proposal, to be retraced, retracted, undone, and made amends for. Happily M1r. CORDEN and his friends have no objection to our taking the most vigorous measures to defend our new position. We have heard of an armed neutrality a.nd an armed peace, but this is to be an armed repentance, an armed retractation. We are to confess to Commissioner YsEi and His Celestial MAAJESTY that With regard to the events of the eight months ending June next England is heartily sorry, and begs their pardon ; but, if they presume on this confession, then, of course, we must protect ourselves. This is the poli:y to be sent out with the perfectly cozapeteut man, and we certainly think that nobody *iiU be so competent to carry out the policy as tlhe propounder of it or one of his right hon. colleagues in the proposed new Administration. Here, then, we are glad to say, the British public may linotw what they have to choose from. On the one side they have an existing Government which has just brought England out of a terrible war, and danger of other wars hardly less formidable, into peace and security, but which, hearing that HEn 3A.TESTY' s servan6s on the other side of this planet are in diflicuzlties with a barbaric and intractable race, refuses at once to discredit and abandon them, but waits for the result of prudent advice and ample reinforcements. On the other side they have a sudden gathering of those who only two years ago were busily employed in damaging our credit and tying our hands iu the war with Russia, and now reiterate the sanie game on a wilder, if not a larger, scale, by proposing a wild goose chase after a perfectly competent man, to be found to-day and stnt out to-morrow, with orders to eat humble pie to Commissioner YEII, his assassins, and his poisoners. We understand the advice. It is not the first instance we have heard of it. Long ago schorning politicians found it their game to oppose everything that was practical, and to make Inagnificent displays of stump eloquence in behalf of w-hat was utterly unpractical and could never be brought to any actual test. It is a policy which has sometimes had a partial and toenporary success, though, of course, it defeats itself in the end. Can the British public be duped by such a policy ? Of course, they are not free from credulity. The commercial history of the last year tells sad tales on this point, but the general election will tell a much sadder tale, with still moro deplorable results, if in fickle distrust of an Administration known to be worthy of its confidence it brings into power an omnium gatkcrurnm Administration, of whose joint policy nothing can be known, except a wild proposal for a "competent man," and a humble but strongly-armed apology to Commissioner YEn.
One of the first consequences of the recent out-
One of the first consequences of the recent outbreak of party spirit in the House of Commons is the indefinite postponement of all those great measures of social reform to which we had been lookling forward with so much hope. Among these the Law of Divorce occupies a very pro. minent place. Until the present titne, the piety of soinc, the prejudice of othors, the la%vyerps chicane, and the feeblo alipslop of the sentimentaist have stood in tho way of progres upon this most important matter. The time, however, had arrived when the public opinionit would be moro correct to write the public feeling-of the country seemed willing at length to tolerate legislation upon the subject. Cruel as the consequences of the cxisting state
law hare been to many a strong man who has psed through life with a blight upon his heart, and to many a feeble woman, whoa- ouly comfort it has been that there was one grim Court in which, sooner or later, a suit for Divorce a vinc,.o vit.n could be sustained, still in the main a deepseated reverence for the most iimportant relation w'hich cm subsist betwetn Suman bdiea wFas at the hottom of the auomaly. We da~lc, not patc)', a eamt ci replace a stonelest the XJx ryrarniV. ah t4pple down, and with
it the genius of the country. Experience, however, has shown us that our fears were misplaced. The very bats that weave their circles in the twilight grow weary of repeating their giddy fgures without a result. Was there not one clear -drop at the bottom of the famous well to cleanse -and refresh the palate, clammy and jaded with the ,endless alternative of a truism or a fallacy I Such .a remedy we have discovered at last by the careful inspection of actual facts, and by a higher con6dence in the impulses of humani nature, and in the compensations given by the CREATOr in the aMidst of their outward miseries to the creatures into whose nostrils He has breathed the breath of life. We have ceased to believe that the insolent happiness of some requires to be so strictly stockaded in by the agony of others. If left to itself in greater measure, society-English society--will not faU to pieces. We are not separated from the Satturnalia of vice by a couple of clauses in a Draconic statute, failing wh-ch the virtuous ,matron would cast fiom her the glories of her crown, and the father and the husband desert those whomii it is his duty to protect. Human affections, luckily, do not depend upon Acts of Parliament. A large majority of the more sobermninded members of the commniity have at length appreciated this conclusion. Had they not arrived at it by e tiriori reasoning as well, an honest glance at the customs of England for some centuries past should have satisdied them of the justice of the result, at least on one side. The question E Rot " Shall the power of Divorce be " conceded to the people of this counitry ?"' It has been conceded already. The real question at issue. is, " ShaU the power of Divorce be given to "all Englishmen-to the rich and the poor - alike ?" At present it is like a bottle of Johannisberg or a Strasburg pie-a dainity, a luxury for the rich man's table. There is a little bill to pay before a husband can repudiate a wife who has brought disgrace upon his children and desolation to his lhome, and the qsum total is 1,0001., more or less. The case of the wife against her husband does not, indeed, nominally present the same anomalay; for in all classes of society, as far as she is concerned, the chain is in appearance of equal weight. Wealth, however, has compensations which are denied to poverty, if these mount no higher than greater isolation and larger draughts of freeer air.
Upon the capital point in this inquiry-namely, the form of procedure to be observed in future,difference of opinion appears mainly to have been allayed. Whatever may be the grounds of Divorce which are hereafter to be allowed as sufficient-to whatever degree the rules which regulate the proceedings taken by the wife against the husband may be relaxed, thus much is clear,-the old machinery of the common law actioni, the proceed-ings in the Ecclesiastical Court, and the Act of Parliament, must be discarded. There meust be a Coourt or Courts of competent jurisdiction in which for the suture all matrimonial causes shall be heard and determined. The more simple the forms-the more economical the proceedingsthe more politic and just wiU lle the innovation. Lord REDESDALE is, we believe, the last man of any note who adheres to the old system, as he is the last of that portentous series of Augur-like men who have occupied the legal seats in the Upper Rouse, and who have foreseeni nothing but the ruin of the country in every beneficial change which has been introduced during the last halfcentury. This facility of procedure is the hinge upon which the ultimate settlement of this important question turns. The mere administration of the law will bring to light its defects and shortcomings. WVe can readily conceive that upon matters so delicate as these legislation will not attain to finality at a single bound. When it is discovered, as it most surely will be, that no very disastrous consequences follow uponi the relaxation of the Divorce laws, even the most cautious aud circumspect vill be willing to pass dryahod from one stepping-stone to another. Thus, in a few years we shall arrive at a satisfactory settlement without doing violence to the scruples and prejudices of the community. Even at present we are not altogether without precedents which may serve to gWude us to sound conclusions. Let us look at the practice of a foreign country. In France the proceedings to obtain a separation which, except that it does not authorize a new marriage, operates as a divorce, are in this wise :-Tne claim is carried before the Judge of the arronidissement, who examines the claimant, and makes up a record of the facts. A day is then named foj both parties to appear before the Judge in private. Hie makes such remarks as the case appears to call for, and addressessuch represciitations as he may -consider likely to produce a reconciliation. If these fail, the cause is then remitted to the higher Court, wlhich again gives the parties a hearing with closed doors. The next step is the public trial; witnlesses are examined in private, but the arguments and the decision take place. in open Court. The results of this system may be read in the return of the cases decided in all France during the year 1854. The total number was 1,681, of which 1,242 were admsitted, 174 were rejected, and 265 were abandoned on the rezonciliation of the parties under the influence of judicial advice. Of the claims 1,510 were by wives, and 171 by husbauds. The grounds of the claims are thus classed :-First, ill-treatment, 1,410 ; secondly, adultery by wife, 116; thirdly, adultery 'y husband, 109; fourthly, infamous crimes, 46-total, 1,681. Now, there can beno doubt that the sentences of separation pronounced in the 1,410 cases which stand in the first category were of unmixed benefit to French society. Not only were so many poor creatures freed from thraldom and suffering worse than death, but the knowledge that the unhappy wife had the power in her hands of repudiating him from her home, and froni the lion's share in her modest earnings, must have checked the uplifted hand of many a rtiffian, ainil paralyzed the profligacy of many a spendthrift. The introduction of this form of proceeding would be of greater advantage in England even than in France; for-it is sad to write it-there is more brutal usage on the part of English than of French husbands. Whether -this be a result of national character, or whether
-i nas grown out of the existing state of the law, we will not say, but the fact is lamentably true. WVho can read the hideous tales which sre brought to light every day at the metroDolitan police-oltices-this very day for instance-without -a wish tlhat some way of escape could be given to as many of the vwretched victims of masculine brutality as could find the means of support by -their ownz exertions ?
With regard, then, to the form of procedure, and -to the extension of greater facilities than at present exist for separation-not carrying with it -the right of contracting a fresh marriage-our course wouild seem to be tolvrably clear. Lord CRANWOnTIIS impossible Bill is, however, as much a's in this as in well nigh every other respect. s%Upon his measure he has en,grafted a -clause which would permit every husband and wife who had a " tiff",-every husband and wife who -were in collusion-to part company for 1ife at a moment's warning. This provision surely sever can become law. The Chancellor, too, errs as much on the side of omission as in what he actually enacts. Is it credible that either through design or neglect he has entirely passed eover that foul opprobrium upon our judicial sys. ten-that stain upon our national character-the Abominable acQtion of Cfim. Con. ? It is obyious
that immediately we throw aside the machinery of Divorce by Art of Parliament all colourable justification for this action entirely ceases. It has been always stated that it was but a cog in a complicated maeline, and could not bo displaced without danger of throwing the whole apparatus out of gear. Here, however, is an end of Divorce by Act of Parliament -why not, then, of the common law action for damages as well? Nobody would be a sufferer but a few of the more sonorous members of the Bar, and the sooner they earn their fees in some more creditable manner the better forthemselves and for the honour of their profession. Passing from this point, there is also certainty upon anotber-namely, the propriety of guarding the modest carnings of married women-belonging to the classes of tradespeople and day-workers-from the rapacity of their worthless husbands. In the upper ranks of life any such provision would be almost necessarily a formal one, for, according to English practice, the property of married women who bring their contribution to the common stock is ordinarily vested in trustees. Here, then, are many essential points in a new Divorce Bill about which there could be but very little difference of opiuion. If only these entered into the composition of such a measure no doubt vast benefit would be already obtained, and we should be oil the right road for further progress. More complicated questions-questions upon which there is greater diversity of opinionremain, such as the grounlds upon which an entire Divorce, with faculty of re-marriage, should be granted. All of these we should be disposed to handle with the greatest circumspection. It is easier in such matters to advance than to recede. As an example of a cams omissus in the ChanceUor's Bill, we may, however, cite the instance of a person condemned to such a period of penal servitude as is tantamount to civil death. It is difficult to see upon what reasonable grounds in such a case a woman should not be allowed to marry again. Her husband is practically dead to her and to the world. The grounds of absolute Divorce are, however, the real difficulty of the question, and there is no necessity for grappling with them at the present time.
The affairs of the Royal British Bank have, we
The affairs of the Royal British Bank have, we trust, been considerably advauced towards a settlement by the proceedings of the general meeting of the depositors on Wednesday last. On this occasion it was resolved by a large majority that a certain composition on the part of the shareholders should be accepted, and a petition to Parliament was agreed upon in favour of an Act which should bind the minority of the creditors to the acceptance of the terms referred to. It appears that after the legal contest between the Official Assignee and the Official Manager had been terminated a first dividend of 5s. Gd. in the pound was promptly declared, and to this it is anticipated that a second dividend of 3s. will be added in the course of two months. The sum of 8s. Gd. in the pound being thus obtained from the assets in bankruptcy, it has been proposed, in pursuance of arrangements between the shareholders and the creditors, that the former body should raise by contributions a sum snfficient to pay Gs. Gd. in the pound more, making oaltoetherareturnequivalenttothree-fourtbs of the property deposited in the Bank, and that after the 15s. in the pound had thus been produced the Rbareholders should obtain an ecquittance releasing them from further liability. These proposals found favour with the meeting, and if they are carried out a month or two more wiU see an end of the affair.
It is no wonder that such a transaction as this should still give occasion to protests, denunciations, and complaints ; in fact, such has been the operation of the law that each party appears to have been exposed to the greatest possible suffering with the least possible advantage to the other. The creditors could not escape loss nor the,debtors molestation, and while depositors have beenkept out of their money, and are fain to close with a compromise at last, shareholders have been subjected to proceedings so severe as to call down an indignant remark even from tho Chairman of the creditors' meeting. One of MIr. WVYLD'S observations, indeed, went far to explain another. 'When he spolke of the dishonesty of shareholders who, by flying ecross the water, had placed the Channel betweeil them and their creditors, it was plain that he had already said much in their justification by describing the sufferings of those wvho remained behind, and who in some instances had been driven into the Bankruptcy Court and seen their wives and children turned into the streets, not for the satisfaction of the creditors, but the liquidation of law expenses alone. Upon the whole, however, we are far from being convinced that the principle of unlimited liability, as applied to banking, is in itself responsible for any of these deplorable consequences; but are disposed rather to believe that it would have operated with aU desirable effect but for the obstacles incidentally encountered in the way of procedure, and that even under the present circumstances it has been the main instrument in providing the creditors with such security as they have obtained.
Mr. WYLD defined the principle of unlimited liability as " tbe principle of humbug," and he described its operation in terms which appeared to command the assent of the meetin. " If," said he, " every shareholder of the British Bank "had been liable for every 1001. share to the " extent of 5001., he would have paid the money, "and all the depositors would have received 20s. "in the pound; but as, according to the present "law, every shareholder found himself liable to the " extent of 2,0001. or 3,0001. for each 1001., he "was obliged to shirk his liability by every means " that the law enabled lhim to do." But this hardly appears to us to be a comprehensive view of the case. The difficulties of the creditors and the epprehensions of the shareholders arose, not from the mere liabilities of the latter, but from the want of such a machinery as would have realized the assets with fairness to all parties at the least cost and in the smallest possible time. The law of unlimited liability simply provides a fund out of wbich satisfaction may be obtained for the creditors, and gives this fund the largest dimensions possible. The machinery for making this security available is another affair altogether, and it is here that the system, has been found defective.
What, let us ask, constitutes the actual security, such as it is, of the creditors at the present moment ? On what do they rely for bringing the depositors to terms? Evidently on the power with which the lav of unlimuited liability invests them, which wiU ultimately make up their receipts to 15s. in the pound upon their claims, and which, according to Air. VWYLD's own admission, might even bring them 20s. in the end, if they chose to enforce all their rights, and could afford to wait for the result. Nor need this principle have been attended with any embarrassment, if the course of action and the line of procedure at the stoppage of the Bank had been easy, welldefined, and free from the chances of complicat:on. After all, as has been more than once remarked, there was nothing in the actual position of affairs which need have delayed a settlement, if the matter could at once have been put into the hands of any skilful and intelligent men of business. Theme were some 4,000 depositors with certain welkstablished claims; there were 280 sharehold*is, wlo were lisble to be called upoa for such. nriWaimjons as. would maee the es±at
of the Baii. equal to paying 20s. in the pound. How much would have been required from each we caiii,.t pretend to compute, but, since they have a,reed as it is to make up aU but 5s. of this amnont, is it not reasonable to suppose that 20s. could have bten provided at less cost if the intervening expenses could have been saved?
Of the utility of limiting liability in general commercial transactions we have no kdnd of doubt, but the principle involved in that decision does not touch the obligation of a banker to return a deposit to the uttermost extent of his means, nor do we see that the case has been affected by the example now before us. The embarrassnents in this atairi have been produced, not by the law of unlimited liability, but by the impracticability of applying it effectually. What is wanted to secure prompt payment is the power of giving a correspondiig discharge. Every bill should carry its receipt, nor can it be expected that any man will be rta.ly to produce his money when he may be none the better after doing so than he was before. Mr. WYLD'S remarks seemed to point to a species of intermediate liability-something between lirLited and unlimited obligation-as likely to insure the desired result. He did not argue that the creditors would have been kept harmless if each shareholder had been liable solely to the extent of his share, but that this would have been the case if a limitation bad been put upon the excess of his liability-it, for instance, he might have boen bound to pay five times the amount of his investment, but not more. We understand this observation, which amounts, in fact, to our oiwn remark, that readypayments are only to be obtained by ready quittances; but surely the ends desired, that is to say, the satisfaction of the cieditors and the release of the debtors, are to be accomplished by a proper machinery for bringing the lav into action. It is highly natural to advocate such a limitation of liability as would, at aU events, secure the honest debtor from further annoyance after he had paid his share, but we should prefer to see his liability limited, not at any possible expense to the creditors of the Bank, but by the fair apportionment of the entire obligation among the whole numbers liable, and the prompt recovery of the contributions thus due.
Scotch Law is a science, or an art, or a mystery,
Scotch Law is a science, or an art, or a mystery, whereof the dwellers South of the Tweed are profoundly and contentedly ignorant. They adopt their notions of it from novels and gossiping autobiographies. They read Redgauntlet and the Uemoirs of Lord CoclJntr-. They take their ideas of its forms from the labyrinth of pleadings in which PETER PEEBLZS wandered, and of its administration from stories of Lord President DALRY.irLE, -who in his late days thanked GOD that the DALYMIPLYS were all just men-" as fully " appeared from this, that, though they had been "frequent litigants, no one of them had lost a cause "Eince he had sat upon the bench." English lawyers
are content to assert in general terms that Scotch I L-aw is a grotesque caricature of the Civil Law, and English laymen confine their pretensions to information upon the subject to a round statement, that it is a system whereby a man may be married wvithout knowing it, and divorced before he is quite certain that he has been married.
Of course, these are very erroneous notions, but they derive colour and plausibility fiom strange reports of strange cases which now and then cross tlle Border. One of these appears in our columns to-day. It seems that the agent, or, as we should call him, the attorney, of one of the parties in a civil suit conceived a curiosity to know the name of the individual who reported the case for an Edinburgh paper. There was, as we understand, no suggestion that the report was inaccurate, or unfair, or illegal, but the attorney wished to know who wrote it. As we read the statement in the local paper, it was precisely the same as if this agent had some thirty years since felt a desire to ascertain from Mr. CoxsTABLE the name of the individual vwho wrote a novel called WVarerley. In Englaud there would be some difficulty in satisfying this thirst for literary information. The PRIXCE REOEXT was obliged to guess like the cominon herd as to wl1o the Wizard of the North might be ; and we are not aware that even after the celebrated " Letter to the King" the Privy Council ventured to interrogate AIr. WOODFALL as to his knowledge of the authorship of Junius. We are not exempt from the weakness of curiosity here in the South. In a celebrated case two gentlemen felt anxious to know a great secret which then agitated Europe, -whether the Chevalier D'Eox was a man or a woman, and they begged Lord MsNsriFruD to try the question. In another case two less ambitious cuoieux desired to know which was the winner in a dog-fight, and they proposed the issue to Lord TNTErRDEN and a Middlesex jury. The English judges were in both cases indignant, and one of them found a precedent for committing the parties for contempt of Court. Since this salutary check was given people have ceased to make our courts of law a means of prying into their neighbours' affe:rs. If they desire to know the age of an actress, or the day of the month when the secret treaty between MIr. DIsRAELi and Mr. GLADSTONE was signed, or the authorship of the report of the DERBY Meeting, they write to a sporting paper and agree to be bound by the decision. But they manage these things differently in Scotland. There the satisfaction of an idle curiosity becomes the grave office of a Court of Law. Mlr. Sheriff STrEnR, instead of throwing off his carbon and dealing with the matter in sheer irony, hardens himself and sharpens himself for serious action. Proprietors, publishers, and reporters are solemnly summoned before him. He sits in a little Court of Star Chamber; he interrogates the proprietor of the newspaper as to the private arrangements of his establishment; and, upon a refusal to gratify the curiosity of the agent, he threatens to send both Mr. WIsON and MNIr. PAGAN to prison-nay, he actually mak;es out a warrant for their committal to the Gaol of Glasgow.
We know nothing of this Sheriff STrxLE, and are bound to believe him to be an upright and impartial magistrate. In that case he will, of course, pursue the same coercive measures with any Edinburgh publisher who may publish an anonymous work, and with any tradesmau or manufacturer wvho may have a secret of trade which his friends may like to know.
It happened that in this case no positive personal injury was suffered. To the reporter it was a matter of entire indifference whether his authorship of the report was known or concealed, so the name was given, and j.tstice was satisfied. It becomes, however, a matter of some public importance whether an inquisition such as this does legally exist. If so, no man's family affairs or commercial secrets are safe from prying curiosity; and Sheriff STEELE may people the gaols of Scotland with gentlemen who may object to make him their special confidant. The philosopher who, when an impertinent felow asked him what he canied under his cloak, answered, "I carry it " under my cloak that you may not know," was applauded as a witty fellow. If he had been a Scotibman Sheriff STEZE would have sent him to Glasgow gaol.
We hope there may be some error in the report of this transaction. If the facts be correctly stated, Scotland has either a bad law or a bad judge, and one or the other ought to be immedaately changed.

A Glasgow Sheriff On The Liberty Of The Press.
A GLASGOW SHERpFF ON THE LIBERTY OF
TEHE PRESS.
(From the Sots7umaz)
We have just learned that a case occutred in Glasgow a fow days ago in which the liberty of the press appears to have been subjected to an assault of a Tery extraordinary character. It appears that certain judicial proceedings which took place in the Sheriff's Summary Cor. in Glasgow lst umer rere narrated, in ordinary course, in the
columns of the Glsgow Herald; andinconnexionwith these proceediogs a civil lawsint ensued between two private persons. In the course of the litigation the legal agen: of one of these men thought he would better his cause if he could ascertain the name of the person who had supplied to the Herald the information contained in that journal, it being understood that professional newper reporters do not usually attend the court in question. Certain members of the literary staff of the Herald were accordingly sumnoned, about nx weeks ago, to give evidence before Sheriff Steele, but one of them wvho attended respectfnully declinsd, on being interrogated, to give the name of their private correspondent, stating tbai, according to the inrariable rnle of the office, the names of gentlemen communicating with the paper were never divulged, and that, in taking this course, he was asserting a necessary privilege, esneciaUy s the proprietors, while decinmg to reveal their confidential or private operations, at all times held tbemselves responsible for aU the contents of the jourzal. The case was finally adjourned, the sheriff intimeating that if the Herald was not prepared to give the desired information at the next diet means of compulsion would be used. It may be remarked that the accuracy of the Herald's report was not nestioned, and that journal was not mixed up with the lawsuit In any way.
The next stage in the business occurred last week, when MIr. Wilson, one of the reporters for the Herald, appeared before 1r. Sheriff Steele, in consequence of a sumnmons, and was examined by one of the agents. In reply to the demand for the name of the Herald's informant he repeated his former deClinature. To show, bowever, that the Herald was most anxious to avoid anything like contempt of Court, and willng to meet the wishes of the agent, so far as consistent with the good faith they felt ound to keep with their correspondents, Mr. Wilson stated that he was ready to hand up the name wante1 to the slei:ff, not to be used publicly, but that his Lordship might judge whether or not that gentleman was at all likely to have any other object in making the communication beyond that of simply communicatig a matter of fact to a public journaL Sheriff Steele repeUed this overture, stating that he regarded it as an insult to the bench, adding that neither the Herald nor any other newspaper had a right to plead privilege, that the Herald not only was not entitled to with hold, but was bound to give, the name of its confidential correspondentthat the courae the witness was following was obAructive oi pblic justice, and that, in short, if the n ame was not given, W. Wilson must go to prison. This intimation did not move the witness, and, accordingly, a warrant was made out for his comrqittal to the gaol of Glasgow. Before his removal, howevcr, Mr. Pagan, who is the gertlemen responsible in this department of the Herald, and who had also been summoned, was called in. He was asked by the sheriff if it was by his arrangement and concurrence that 3r. Wilson had refused the desired information. Mr. Pagan replied in the affirmative, adding that, for his own part, he must respectfully decline to impart information regarding the private correspondence of the paper, merely because two parties, with whom the Herald bad nO COnnexion whatever, chose to enter into a lawsuit. That if such information could be demanded aU confidential arrangements made with or by a public journal would bh at an end. The sheriff ridiculed the idea of a newspaper having any right to plead "confidential communication," and after some debate stated that he would be compelled to send Mr. Pagan to prison abo. Mr. Pagan replied that be was most reluctant to be made a martyr of, but, ashe could not with integrity make the revelation which was demnanded, no other course was open to him than to submit to his lordship's ultimatum.
At this stage of the proceedings a private conference took place between Mr. Pagan and the agent, and it was afterwards stated in court that it had been arranged that the Hera's correspondent should be asked whether he was disposed to give his name voluntarily, the agent at the same time intimating that if ite name was not given up he would act u'on the warrant for incarceration. On this being intimated to tbe court the sheriff readily granted an adjournment. Wehave been informed that the gentleman who corresponded with the Herald has not the slightest objection to make hin'self known; and thus, in the meantime, the case is at an end.
But this episode gives rise to a serious question. It is this -Can the law demand that a newspaper, or any mercantile company, or o'dinary citizen, must giva up the names of those who bave revealed to them any matter, under the seal of confidence, whenever two parties enter into a law-plea, real or fictitioust Sheiiff Steele says that the vords "confidential communication" do not exist any longer, and all we have to set agamst this dictitm, in the meantime, is the resistance offered by the Gla,oowc Berald, which, however, as will be seen, does not by any means settle the question.

HICHwAY RoBBERY AT LEEDs.-Abont half-past 10 o'clock on Monday night last, aq John Dent, who is an overlooker at the mil of Messrs. Wilkinson, flax spinpers, Hunslet, was walking from Leeds to alunslet, a suburb of that town, he was suddenly seized by the throat from behind and thrown on to the ground. Two or three men immediately rushed upon him, threw romething over his eyes, struck hima violentblow on the head, and otherwiseseverely illtreated him.n He was rendeTci unconscious for a short time, and on recovering his senses he discovered that he had been robbed of his silver watch and a small sum of money, his right side pocket having been completely torn from his trousers and thrown upon the ground. Yesterday three men, named John StnitLi, Isaac Appleyard, and Wilh1am Rider, were taken before the magistrates on suspicion of being the perpetrators of the criue. Appleyard and Rider were clearly shown to have been in company together a few yards lrom the spot about 10 minutes before the robbery was committed, and Smith was seen rnming in a direction from the place immediately after the alarm was raised.

Erla,TIroN TO CANADA.-The Provincial GoverDment is using every exertion h facilitste the settlement of intendimg emigrants, Those who do not wish to locate tbemselvex in the old settled districts will find ready and easy access to the new settlements opened up by the reoent step in favour of free grants of land; and no doubt the chief emigrant agent at Quebec will be authorl7sd to give the necessary information to aUl desiring it on their arrivaL It is q xite probable that the Huron district will this year receive a large accession to Its population; and so will the extensive country lying between Guelph and Owen Sound. Many new vllages have been founded in both sections during the past year, and the opening of the Buffalo and Lake Huron alilway to Godericb, which is expected to take place son, together with the comnpletjon of the Grand Trunk through Berlin and Stratford, must contribute largely towards the settlement of these fertile districts. Emigrants rith small capital will find the north-west an excellent location. Land can there be olt3ined at very reasonable rates, while in the more settled sections it has greatly increased in value. The greater portion of the tradesmen and mechanics emigrating to this country will naturally be desirous of locating in the towns and cities; stil there is a wide opening for that class of emigrants in the new settlement&.-Hamllton correspondent of Canadmin Ntis.

PARIS, WEDSSZSDAY, ]LMACu 4, 6 P.
The defeat of the EngEsh 3inistry in the MouseI of Commons, which was known here at an early hour this morning, is the principal topic of the moment, and various conjectures are made as to the course Lord Palmerston will take. The Ministerial eveningjournal, Le Pays, makes the following remarks-
" We limit ourselves to pointing to the inconvenience of an immediate dissolution at a perod wheu the Budget is not yet voted. How has the Palmerston Mlinistry fallen on the Chinese question? This it is not possible for us to examine until all the speeches for and against it have passed under our eyes We cannot consider as sufficiently explanatory all that bhs been said on the character of the lorcha on board of which the Chinese had arrested a number of perons, and by so doing violated the British flag. The debates in the Houxe will, no doubt, disclose to us the particular points ou which Lord Palmerston, in spite of his personal ability, found himself so weak before Parliament. Besides, we must not exaggerate the meaning of what has just oc. curred. The check experienced by the Cabinet has nothing surprising if we reflect that for two years Lord Pslmerston has governed with a majority swolen, according to ci-cumstances, by such or such an addition, but, in point of fact, with a minority. In fact, the House of Commons in only made up of minorities. The Tory party, broken by Sir Robert Peel, is now in tvo fractions-the Conservatives properly so called, and the Peelites-forming two minorities. The Whigs. more numerous, have been also broken up into fraction_ since Lord John Russell separated from Lord PFaxnerston. The Mlanchester Radical the Peace Party, &c, are but inpercep. tible fractions. The unity of parties can only bo effected by the reconciliation of Conservatives with Peelites, and by the transformation of the Whig party, which was not long ago abandoned by Lord John Russell on the question of Reform."
Again the Pays observes,-
" Is the country more decided than the Parliament
Has it ideas more fixed, or a plan to carry out ? In that case the elections may have a precise signification. If the contrary, they would merely result in displacing some votes in one sense or the other, and prolonging the state of transition, of which the consequences, partially veiled during the war, now appear, and constitute for Great Britain the difficulties of peace."
It is said here that, in consequence of the last news froni China, the French fleet in those seas, under the command of Admirals Guerin and Rigault de Genouilly, will be reinforced by three ships of the line.
A private letter from St. Petersburg announces that it was known in that city by special courier that the Governor of Russian Siberia had despatched a columnu of troops towards Kiakhta, on the frontiers of China. It is added, that this measure has been adopted in agreement with the Couirt of Pekin.
The meeting of the Conferences on the NeuchAtel question is now no longer distant, though as yet no precise date is fLxed. The intelligence communicated yesterday with reference to the growing willingness of the King of Prussia to agree to certain concessions is confirmed. Whether he will persevere in that disposition it is difficult to say. The Swiss, on their side, will also be expected to make concessions, so that by this siniultaneous movement towards each other the ground of difference will be narrowed. With respect to the Plenipotentiaries, I have to say that Dr. Kem will represent the Confederation, and not Colonel Barmann, as soon as it shall be decided whether a Swiss Plenipotentiary will be admitted. The Conference will consist of the representatives of the Powers who were parties to the protocol of 1Si2, including Prussia. It was at first said that both Prussia and Switzerland would be excluded, but the present arrangement is as I bave just stated.
The Grand Duke Constantine of Russia sailed from Genoa for Nice on the 28th ult., on board the Russian corvette Viborg.
Count Cavour left Turin on the 2d instant for Genoa, to attend the experiments to be made with the machine invented by MMI. Somoiller, Grattolini, and Grandi, for piercing the Alps. The previous experiments had completely succeeded, but Count Cavour wished to be an eye-witness of them.
Yesterday a solemn mass in music vas celebrated in the church of the MIadeleine to the memory of Jacques Cceur, the illustrious silversmith to Charles VII., and nov dead exactly 400 years, A considerable number of persons attended this religious solemnity, which was got up by the Society of Inventors and Manufacturing Artists. The ceremony attracted the attendance of the most eminent men in trade, manufactures, and literature. A select number of artists, under the direction of 3. Pasdeloup, admirably executed the great RAeptiern of Mozart. The organ wasplayed by AL Lefebvre Wely. After the Gospel the Abbe Duquesnay, rector of St. Laurent, recapitulate(Z in an eloquent discourso, the principal events in tie life of Jacques Ceeur, the founder of French commerce, who was so devoled to his country and his King. The preacber, taking advantage of his subject, spoke at some length and with much animation on the moral influence which commerce, manufactures, and the arts deservedly exercise on the condition of human society. He sanctified, it may be said, industrial labour and commerce, by demonstratino that both spring from the Deity himself' and that man, as His image, is at the same timre the creator, when, by enriching the world with the wonders of inventive genius, he does not convert them into the instruments of a selfish and corrupting sensuality, but applies himself, on the contrary, to render the force of capital and of labour serviceable to the moral and intellectial, as well as the material, development of the greatest number. This scientific explanation of the principles of Christianity, delivered from the pulpit in such eloquent language, produced a profound sensation on the assembly.
The following private telegraphic despatches have been received -

SPAIN.
(yROY oua OWN' CORRPOXDVrT.)
MADRID. Fn 28.
Yesterday was the St. 1aldomero, celebrated in 1856 with many congratulations, but which in 1857 passed unheeded in Madrid, save by a few mindful friends who in their hearts uttered awish of happiness to Marshal Espartero. He, whome star has set, and Marshal Narvaez, whose star is for the moment in the asceudant, typify the two great evils from which Spain has suffeed so much rl-itical incapacity and political corruption. Had Narvaez been as honest and patriotie aa he for some years proved himself energetic aud lpow-rfu, had Espartere's grasp of mind and morl oDurage been equal to his probity and popularity, the position and prospects of Spain might to-day be different indeed froa what they ane. It is a fact daily more generally recognized, that what Spain wants to extricate her froIt the slough is only one man, so hebe at once able, honest, and bold. Tbe old fever of enthusiwn for liberty and constitutionalism is much calmid down, and there is a eontinual increa8% in tha wlnb et thoso who would welcome V., &h
lightened' despotism as a most exoellent eMetiaige for annual revolutions and ever-recurring anarchy. If the French nation-loathingN the Saturnalia, bloodshed, and insecurity that fohowed closely upon the heels of the inconsiderate overthrow of the moat truly liberal ri-gimc France ever witnessed-acted 'wisely in confiding its destinies to the Iili and talents of one remarkable man, how much morew ready ought the Spanish people to be to abandon, at least for a while, its oft-repeated and abortive attempts at that self-government for which it is evidently not yet ripe ! What Spain is ripe for, and now greatly needs, is material improvements, not con:titutional thoories. Tho po litical history of this country, for years a t as been a pitiable and disreputable farce. 1 nder the banner of patriotism different sets of men have struggled for party predominance and personal advantages. They have deafened the world vith their shouts of "Patria y Libeitad!" while in reality their aims were purely selfish. Disinterested though they proclaimed themselves when out of power, no sooner did they get in than their avidity was disgustingly manifest. The few honourable exceptions, wlho would havo stemmed the tido of greediness and corruption, were deficient in energy, in capacity or in weight, and were borne away by the stream. Their repeated defeats, forcing upon them the conviction that they are powerless, have disbeartened them; and if some among them still cherish hopes many others candidly admit that they would rather sacrifice for a while their dreams of political freedom than see their country continue an arena for the conflicts of rival factions, to the destruction of the material progress and prosperity she might otherwise attain.
If Spain, thanks to her own folly and internal dissensions, has hitherto remained practically close) to most of those great inventions and improvements wbich, during the last quarter of a century, have done so much for the well-being of other European. countries, she has still been unable to prevent their being brought to her doors, and, as we may say, knocking for admittance. The railroad shrieks and snorts along her northern frontier as if impatient at exclusion; rteamers under every flag touch at all her ports; the freedom of commerce she so, obstinately rejects. adopted by countries wiser than herself, has generously bestowed on her a foretaste of its advantages. The demand for her produce has increased ; the receipts of her Custom-house, notwithstanding the corruption of its officers and the encouragement given to the smuggler by an injudicious tariff, continually augnment, and show, according to a statement just published, an improvement of more than 220,0001. in 1856 as compared with 1855. If Spain eould be sure, only for 10 years, of a wise and strong Government, no matter in what form-let us put aside, for the moment, al questions of this or that constitution, of Cortes upon this or that system, aud all the other theories and fancies for whose sake the countrybas gone distracted and torn itself to pieceshow rapid a change woould take place in her circumstances I With the certainty of tranquility and. security; with a reformed tariff, wlhich should. divert into the treasury the stream of gold that now flows into the pockets of smugglers and foreigners; with the resumption of the sale of church property, unjustifiahly and illegaUy interrupted; with the absolute suspension of civil and military promotions until the half-pay and pension list should be greatly reduced from its present enormous and scandalous dimensions,with these changes the credit of Spain would. quickly revive, her finds w.ould rise, foreignx capital would flow in, railways would be constructed, the expenditure would diminish while the revenue would rapidly increase, and at the end of the 10 years the nation w.ould be too prosperous and too busy to think, save with repugnance and alarm, of a recommencement of political prontuncianientos and insurrectibns. But it were vain to hope for the realization of this pleasant dream so long as the fate of the country hangs upon the intrigues of a corrupt Palace and upon the squabbles and rivalries of unprincipled and unpatriotie statesmen. The wealth and material prosperity of Spain wiU increase,-of that there is no doubt; but they will do so purely as a conseouence of the great internal ricbes and resonrces of the land, vhich as yet have scarcely been dramwn upon. The improvement wil be slow in comparison with that of other countries, and immeasurably slower than it would be under that good government which ia proverbially said to be the only blessing that Providence has not vouchsafed to this fertile and beautiful Peninsula.

MONEY -MARKET and CITY INTBLUaRNOB.
Thrsday Evening.
The English funds opened this morning at the lower prices of yesterday, and soon experienced a further decline, from which there was ultimately a reaction. Consols for money were first quoted 93i to i, and after having touched 93g they recovered to 93, to i for money and 941 to i for the account. They then remainedwithout alteration to the official
lose, but at a later hour there was a renewed fall of an eighth. The settlement passed off favourably, less stock being thrown upon the market than on former occasions. Loans on Government securities were in full, but not excessive demand, at 6 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222; Reduced, 93g to t; New Three per Cents., 93i to 94k; India Stock, 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98jtoi; India-bonds, 4s. discount to par; and ExchequerbiUls, par to 3s. premium. The Reduced and Lona Annuity transfer books closed to-day for the dividends. Those of the New Three per Cents. will close to-morrow.
In the discount-market and at the Bank of England the demand was more active than had been anticipated.
Foreign securities opened with firmness, but there was subsequently a slight reaction. In Turkish Six per Cents. for the account the transactions were at 97s, i, R, and J. The bargains in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, were at 101 and i. The general business comprised-Buenos Ayres, for the account, 85 and 86; New Granada Active, 22k; Mexican, for the account, 22i, #, i, and J; Peruvian, for account, 79t, 79, 791, 78g, and 79; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44 ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98i and J; Spanish New Deferred, 24k; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98i and 99.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 50c. for money, and 71f. 1Oc. for the end of the 2nonth, showing a further decline of about a quarter per cent. in consequence of sales for immediate delivery.
In the Stock-Exchange and at Lloyd's to-day addresses have been in preparation to Lord Palmerston, requesting him to stand for London.,n the Stock-Exchange, although the members were completely occupied with the settlement of the Consol account, there was general eagerness to adopt the suggestiOn, and before the close of busines3 the signatures of 467 voters had been obtained. This demonstration as regards promptness and unanimity, is believed to be without a parallel in that establishment. At Lloyd's the step was not proposed until late in the day, but it was received wi th immediate concurrence, and in an extremely short time a long and most respectable list was formed. It was said, indeed, that among all the persons invited to sign only two refusals had been met with.
Some of the letters from Paris to-day assert that the Government have interdicted all the leading French journals from giving currency to the Russian railway scheme. This measure, supposing it to have been adopted, may have arisen from the evidence furnished that the attempt to introduce the speculation in London would prove a total failure, and that consequently the whole amount of subscriptions originally contemplated for London and Paris would have to be thrown upon the latter city alone.
Notwithstanding the atrrival of silver yesterday from the West Indies and MIexico, 30,0001. in gold has been withdrawn from the Bank to-day to pay for purchases on the continent.
The bar silver brought by the Mexican packet has been sold at 61d. per oz., being an advance of Ad.
T'he suspension has been announced to-day of Messrs. Copland, Barnes, and Co., provision merchants. They were an old and respectable finn, and their difficulties are attributed to heavy losses on a contract for victualling the steamers of the Royal Mail Company, especially on the intercolonial route.s. The amount of their liabilities has not transpireL According to some accounts it is about 40,0001.
The report of the Great Northern Railway Com- any, just issued, states the amount of stock frauduently put forth by Redpath to have been about 220,000l. Against this there will be a set off of the houses and property seized, the value of which the directors are not at present prepared to estimate, although it is believed in other quarters to be about 50,0001 It appears that Redpath was installed in his important and uncontrollled position at the economical salary of 2501. per annum, and that the directors were at the timne fully aware that he had been a successful speculator. They thought, however, that he was satisfied with his success, a result hardly ever yet known in gambling history, and upon his making a "promise" to abstain for the future "from speculating inshiares or stocks of any description, he was appointed registrar." This is their simple avowal, and it remains for the shareholders at the meeting appointed for Thursday next to express an opinion upon it.
The shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the month of January show an increase in the employment of tonnage commensurate with that in the declared value of our exportations. The augmentation has been exclusively in British and TJnited States' vessels. Subjoined are the general figures:-
Entered inward-
With regard to the coasting trade it appears that the aggregate capacity of the vessels entered inward in January, 1855, was 908,937 tons; in 1856 it was 1,071,832; and in the present return it is 1,061,029 tons, including 15 foreign vessels of an aggregate burden of 4,344 tons. The clearances outward were 1,006,933 tons in January, 1855; 1,043,995 in 1856 ; aud 1,106,657, inoluding 2,432 tons of foreign, in 1857.
The prospectus has been issued of the Paris Chocolate Company, with a capital of 30,0001., in 21. shares. The object is to extend the manufacture which has been for some time in progress at mills at Isleworth.
The Isabella Hercus has arrived from Shanghai with 513,4101b. of tea and 1,725 bales of silk.
At a meetinr to-day of the Universal Purveyor Company (established for supplying unadulterated articles of consumption to the public), Sir T. Tancred presiding, the report was adopted and a committee appointed to consider the terms of a proposed amalgamation with three other establishments, by which operations may be considerably extended. It was urged that the principle upon which the company is founded works advantageously, but that a greater amount of capital is required to enlarge business and to secure moreumportant connexions. Fortemporary purposes 2,0001. isneeded,which will be raised on debentures at 5 per cent., with an additional privilege of 2i per cent. discount on purchases of goods.

The City Forgeries.
TIT CITY FORaOMMS.
CENTRAL CRIMUi&. COn1RT Mx r
(Before the CHEP BARo.V and Afr. Baron BRA3Wn;LL) At the sitting of the Court James Townsend Saward, aged 58, described as A laboUrer, and James Anderson, aged 36, described as a servant, were placed at the bar to plead to several charges of forgery.
There were four Separato indictments, to all of which the prisoners pleaded " Not Guilty." Both prlsoners presented a very dejected appearance, and Saward in particular had loAt the confident demeanour he exhibited while wnder examination a. the Mansion-house.
Before the trial was proceeded with Samard addressed the Court, and asked for a counsel to be assigned to him. He said that a brief had been prepared, but he had been unable Io retain oounsel; but if the brief were to be placed in the Lands of any gentleman at the bar a delay of a quarter of an bour would enable him perfectly to understand the case, and to show that he was entirely innocent.
The CIEaF BA:ROIT said, he had no power to assign him counseL It was arranged lst week that the trial shotld come on to-day, and he had had ample opportunityr to in. stract counsel to defend him.-
Saw&rd said that, under these circumstances, he should leave his case entirely in the hands of the Court.
The prisoners were thenjointlyccharged withbaving forged and uttered an order for the payment of 100l , with intent to defraud.
Sir F. Thesiger was specially retained with Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Sleigh to oonduct the prosecution. No counsel appered for the prisoner Anderson.
Sir P. TRmsioxR, in opening the case to the jury, com-
menced by ob3erving that he could not help expressing his 1 regret that the prisoner Saward should have made the application they had just heard, and that it should appear that
he was deprived of the necessary legal assistance upon his i trial. It is (said Sir F. Thesiger) the firt ntimation tho counsel for the Crown have received that the prisoner was unprovided with counsel, and certainly so late back as Saturday last both prisonms were distinctly informed that the trial would come on to-day. What enderounrs havo been made to procuro counsel I am
of course ignorant of; but it is clear that, as the counsel I for the Crown, I have only one daty to perform, and that is to proceed with the task that devolves upon me. The case I have to lay before you is one of the most serious chxracter, involving the highest punishment known to the law short of the capital, and I am sure I need not ask for the most patient and careful attention at your hands to the evidenco which I shal lay before you in support of the charge. I regret to say that the prisoner Saward is a barrister, having been called to the bar In 1840 by the Society of the Inner Temple, to wrhich I have the honour to belong, and I need hardly say how gratified I should be ifit oould bo made out that the prisoner is not guilty of the serious offenco that is alleged azainst him. Tho
otner prisoner has formerly been a gentleman's servant, and latterly he haJ been a waiter at different hotes, and both are charged with having jointly, and with other persons, carried on * nost gigantic system of forgery upon the bankers of this metropolis The charge wMU mainly rest upon the evidence of two persons named Hardwicke and Atwel who were undoubtedly concerned in aU these transactions, and to Whose evidencl
the jnry ought not to attach any weight unless it be con. firmed by independent testimony. I believe, however, that corroboration of the most ample kind will be given of their eTidence, and that In the result the jury will only be able to arrive at one conclusion-namely, tbat the prisoners are guilty of the offence that is charged against them by the present indictment. The prioners stnd charged for sforging and uttering an order for the payment of 1004; but it is important that I should draw your attention to other similar transactions in which tbey were engaged, sO as to leare no doubt on your minds that they perfectly wel knew that the check in question was a forged cbeck The first transaction was one connected with Mr. Doe, an ironmonger in Bricklane, Spitalfields In December, 1855, Mr. Doe's premises were broken open, and from his iron safe among other things taken away there were two blank checks and several other canceUeid checks, which had been previouly roe turned by the hankers, Messrs. Barclay and Co. Atwell took these checks to a porson named Saunders. Saunders said he thought these two checks might be made use of, and in a few days afterwards he introduced Atwell and Mr. Saward. Mr. Saward was on that occasion desirous to know the sort of basine that was carried on by lMr. Doe for the purpose, no doubt, of adapting the amount of the check to his circamstances He Was accordingly taken to Mr. Doe's, and, seeing that the business was not a very extensive one, he said he was afraid that not much could be made of these checks. He told AtWell, however, that they would produce something, and he proposed to introduce Atwell to a person whom he caUed Davis, a person who afterrds appeared to be Anderson, to whom sbortly afterwards Saward introduced AtweUL It appears that Anderson took a lodging in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields, under the name of Davis, and he there answered persons and letters sent to him, among whom were two persons named Driver and Brown He di. rected Driver to come to his lodging in Leman-street, and BrtoW Ws to wait for him at the Eastern Counties Railway. On the 9th of January, 1856, the parties met in Spitblfields Saward produced two checks which he had forged in the nAme of T. B. Doe upon Barclay And Co., one for 45 15s. GL, and the other, which was dated on the 10th of January, 1856, for 951. 17s. 6d. They compared these checks with the cancelled checks, and then Saward, having torn up the cancelled checks, gave the other two checks to Driver, who had been desired by Anderson, under the nsme of Davis, to come to him iu Lemanstreet Driver Accordingly went to the lodgings in Lemanstreet, and then Anderson (in the name of Davis) sent him to Messrs. Barclay and Co. with the check for 46 1Us. 6d AtweU folowed him to Messrs. Barclays, where the check was presented and was paid. AtweU having informed Anderson, who was waiting in the neigh. bourhood of his lodgings, that the check WAs paid, went to Leman-street, nd there received the money from Driver. The parties then proceeded to the Estern Counties Railway, where the other young man, Brown, made his appearance ccording to appointment. Another check for 954 17s. 6d. was given to Brown by Atwell, just in the same way as the former check was to Driver, to be pre. sented to Messrs Barclay aitd Co. That check was also paid. Anderson met Brown on his return from the bankers. He took him to a publichouseand there received the money from him; and then all the parties proceeded to the Hackneyroad. Mr. Saward said he would get the notes changed by Jackl Hall, and he went away and got the notes changod He returned and the money was divided, Saward receving his share from Atwell nd Anderson An arrangement was then made between AtweU and Saward, that if Atwel should procure any more checks he should communicate with Saward, and, on the other haad, if he (Saward) had any more business for Atwell to do he would inform him. An occasion which the parties anticipated was not long in arriving. Atwell, under the name of Hawkes, had intthe meantime taken a lodging in Cottage-lane, City-road. A gentleman named Ash, who carries on business as an iron. merchant in Upper Thames-street, and who banks with Messrs Smith, Payne, and Co., had his premises broken into, and had some blank checks and also some canceled checks taken a ,and these had oome into the possescion of Mr Saward. r Saward, according to an arrangement made with Atwell, called at Atwell's houso, and there was seen by Atwell's mistress and also by AtweU. Sawvard ten produced to AtwdU the cancelled checks of Mr. Asb and also the blank checks which I have mentioned. An arrasgement was made with regard to the filling up of these blank checks and to the passing them off. Mr. Anderson had on this occasion thken a lodging in the name of anmmond in Oakloy-crescent, City-road. Tbeusnalcourse was pursued; an advertisementwas inserted and answered, and a young man came to Oakleycrescent. A check for 911 was delivered to this young nian to be presented At the bankers'. He went to the banic of Smith, ayne, and Co., followed by Atwell; but the check was stopped, and the young man was detained upon Which Atwell immediately went to the parties at a place previously Arranged among tbem, and of course they forthwith dispersed. Inquiry was made at Oakly-crescent for the parties, but of course they were gone. The next matter which occurred among these partics was the drawing of checks of Messrs. Bramxh and Sons on Messrs Ransome and Co., the bankers. These ¢hecks were obtained by means of a forged order for a check-book from the bankers That check-book having b en got, Saward immediately proceeded to forge three checks-one for 471 12s., another for 71. lOs., and a third for 874 14L, all of which were paid. Shortly afterwards a check of Messr Dobree and Sons, who, I believe, are mercbants in Tokenhouse-yard, came into the possessinn of Mr. Saward, Anid he prepared a billof exchaugefor 3861. 17s. lOd1, which purported ro be accepted by Messrs. Dobree and Sons, payable at Hankeys and Co. Saward had for that occasion taken lodgings under the name oF White in Coseberland-street, Hackney-road. This bill for 3$61. 17s. lOd. was given to a young man to present at Hank4y's for payment. Anderson, in disguise, watched the aoung man to the bank, but the bill was stopped, and the money was not pid. The parties having timely notice
f this were soon dispersed. The next transaction which I have to detail to you is important to be borne in mind, and is one displaying rather aeinzular degrce of ingenuity on tho part of these persons. A 1r. Alfred Tnrner, who is a solicitor in lIed Lion-street, had his pocket picked, And his pocket-book was taken from him, containing two blank thecks and a letter addressed to himself, thus showing t,, wbhm the book belonged. Mr. Saward wAs particularly di sirons 'f obtaining the handwriting of Mr. Turner, and he therefore suggested the following ingenious mode of gaining his object :-He prepared an I 0 U for 301 in tho isame of Regp, And it was arranged that Atwell should go to Mr. Tarner and desire him, as his solcitor, to write to his supposed debtor Hoep fur the payment of this suppos3ed IOQU. Mr. Satward sogg.-sed that whenw the payment wvas made the money should he allowed to remain in the hands of Mr. Tnrner for t'so or three days, in order, probably, that he should pay it into his bankcers, so that rhen it wa asked for ir. Turner should give a check bein his aina
tire for tbe amount Anderson took a lodging in the nirhe of Hesp, and in due form a letter -as addresed by Mr. Turner for payment of the I 0 U. Mr. Hesp immediately pid the debt, but all the parties were disa1pointed on that occasion, for Mr. Turner's clerk, who ppbned to have received tho money, paid tho amount in cash,. Mr Saward consoled himself by sayi1g, "W Vell we must wait a little, and then try it again." Well gentlemen, ther did tryitagAin. Inthemeantime-in iay, lo6-br. ard wicke arrived from Van Diemen's land., ,nd renewed his acquaintnoe with Rr. Saward. The met first in FarHnugdon.market, and ther adjourned to a publichousa nexr Southwark-bridg. Pd, having como there rather lato in the day, the Iandlcrd was uithout food to supply then with, and was obh;lCed to send out to a beef ahop- in consequenceofthis circumstance thehousowas alwaysahterwards k-nown by these parties by the name of " the beef-houseoa very itnportant circumstance to bo borne in mind, as the parties were in the habit of meeting thore. Hardwicke bad brought over with him, among other things, a bill of exchango for 200. drawn by Crossman and Co., of Hobsrt Town upon Stephen Kinnaird and Co., of Austinfriars, payable at MlegssHeywood, Kinnaird, and Co.'s. It ws enVeored to Rardwicke. At this " beef-house" near South. wark-bridge Hardwicke handed over that bill to Mr. Saward, who returned it to Hardwicke in the course of the day. Saward then prepared, by mexns of that bill, a bill for 10DX, -rhich purported to be accepted by Messrs. Kin,nwr and Co, and to be payable at Heyward, Kinnaird, nd CO.'s He completed the bill with the exception of the date, and that was left for some convenient opportunity to be filed in. Shortly afterwards Hardwicke, AtwveU d Anderson were at Mr. Townend's shop, a hatter, in Cheneide A young man named John Ofemnents catme in adasef
Hrdwnscame f aollow edt for a situation as light porter. ase he ho nmeU ae young man out of the shop and asked him his name a address, and then promised to Write to him. Anderson had taken lodgings in the Kingsland.road by the name of Ryde, and he addressed a letterto this young man Clements, desiring him t j call upon him. Clementa callod on hin aocordinglY on tho 13th of June. Anderson then made an appointment with him to meet on the folowing day at the Sussex Arms, near the Kingsland-o, whero aD the parties were assebled. On that occaion the bill for 1,0001. was produced. Saward took out a 201. bank-note and gave it to Clements, desiring hirs to get it changed, ad to brin, him two IOs. foreign biW stamps. ClementcJdid as he 3wa ordered, and brought back the change and tho stainp,which he gave to Anderson, and which were taken by him to the Sussex Arms. There Mr. Saward took one of the stamps, ,wrote a roceipt across it, and filled up the date of the bill. He then delivered the biUl to Anderson, who vent and gave it to Clements, who was directed to go andw?resent it at Heywood Kinaird, and Co.'s. Eardi cke had sitarted to tue city, in order to be there before OleIZents. Clementa went by an omnibus, Atwell, unknown to him, seated himself by his aide, and they rode to the city together. Clements went to the bankers, Hey. wood and Co., and presented the bil for 1,OO Hardwicke was at the banking-house and Atwell just outside the bank. The cashier counted out the notes, hut just at that moment he had some misgiving as to the genrineness of the acceptance. He accordingly took the bill, and was comparing it with some other bills-I suppose with some handvniting-when Hardwicke became alrmed, and left the banking-hous. Atwell just went in and saw the cashier take up the notos, payment was refused, and the young man Clements was etainod. Seward and Anderson were waitink in Bishopsgate.churchyard, where the other prties, Hardwicke aLnd Atwell, joined thema after the f ure of this large scheme. But their failure on this occasion induced la. Saward to try another experiment on Mr. Turner, and this was more sucocessful than the first These parties went to a publichouse in Linoolns.inn-flelds, and there Mr. Saward prepared an I OUinthe name of Hart for 1031. 16s. 6d. They rubbed it en the table to giv it the appearance of age. Anderson and Atwell (bearingthe name of Hunter) went to Mr. Tuner's to procre ymet of the I10 U. Atwell's brother was thepesnwo et and paid the money to lr. Turner. They aowed the money to remain in Mr. Turner's hands for a certain time, and that gontleman paid the amount into
i bankers', Messrs. Gosling and Co. When Mr. Hunter went to receive the amornt of the 1. 0. U. Mr. Turner paid it in a check, deducting his own charges, the choc beig fr 10!. S. ld. Ti eecockwas taken to ir. Sward, ,and Mr. Saward set to 'work and forged three checks in the name of Mr. Turner, one of them boing for the sum of 410t 7s. 4d. Mr. Anderson took a lodging in Albert-roadt Regent's-park, in the name of Taylor. HEl there issued an advertisement in the usual mannecr, and a young man named Hardy was engaged by him The check for 410. 7s 4d was given to Eardy, who went to
iessr. Gosling and Co, and the money was paid .Ander. son received that money from the young man, and the
rties had agreed to asemble at the Elephant and
eto share it among them. But Hardwicke missed his friends. Saward sought after him, and, among other places, he made inquiry at Mn. Dixon's, in Unionstreet-a cousin of Hardwicke's. The experiment, howvever, vas entirely successful, and the money was ultimately divided among them. We are now approaching more par. ticularly the period at which the check in question which is the subject of inquiry before you ws3 forged by Mr Saward, and at the same time other sums of a similar de scription upon Mdessrs. Haukey and Co. The check in question is in the name of Baldwin. A check of 1r. Baldwin came into the hands of some of the confederates of Mr. Saward, who prepared three cheeks under the name of Baldwin upon Messrs Haukey and Co.; one being for 501, and two for 1001. each. Upon this occasion the parties adopted a different mode for passing off the checks. They determined to send the porters from different hotels to present the checks for tbem. They frst selected tbe Magpie publichouso, in Bishopsgate-street, whero Saward, wstk Andersonand other parties, assembled. It was first proposed to pass the 501. check, vhich was done in this way:Anderson went to the White Hart publichouse, in Bishopsgato-street, and there delivered the r01. check te the "boots" or porter to take to Hankey's and Co. and get cashed; and having done so he returned to Sa ward at the Magpie. The check was pid, and Anderson, hearing that fact, went again to the wnite Hart and received the money frora the boots, and then immediately changed the money into napoleons at a money-changer's in Lombard-street. He then despatched the porter at the Four Swans with a check for 100!. upon Messrs Hankey and Co., which was also successfuL The money was paid, and Anderson received it at the Four Swans, but when the porter got back it was too late to present the remaining cheek This being Saturday, they all agreed to meet on Monday, the 14th, at Gregory's Hotel in Cheapside They came according to ap ponttnent, and thence they adjourned to a publiehouse in
ood stretChetneide, andt here Anderson was seen to pass over a sum of money to Saward, a circumstance not to bo lost sight of. Anderson then returned to Gregory's HRotel, and desired the porter to take the remaining 1001 check upon Hankey and Co. to the bank. The porter accordingly went there, bt tthe parties were not so fortnate as to this check as they were vwith respect to the other two. Thecheck was refused payment, andthe person presenting it was detained. Of course all the parties dispersed as soon as theyheard what had happened. Now, wth regard to this part of the transaction, I must press most particularly on your attention the fact of Sanrd beiog in the company of Anderson at the M gpie pubalihouse for a considerable portion of the day of the 16th of August
shall have the meet clear and unquestionablo evidence of that fact both of the landlord and the barman of the house. Witd regard to his being at the pubEichonse in Woodstreet and.money p ssing between him and Anderson, I have also the disinterested evidence of a gentleman who happened to be prosent at the time, snd who saw the money padss betwece the garties I am now drawing to the close of thds extraordinary case It only remains for me to detil to yeuntheomanner'in whichthe detection of al these frauds occurred Acheektupon Messrs. Lytens bank, at tar uouth, fellpinto the hands ot here parties, and it immediItey sugsted itself to them that there might be an opportunity of doing some tsincess in that quarter. t wa arranged that Atwell and Heardwicke shold ho down to Yarn outh, Hardwicke under the name of Ralph, and Atwell under the name of Attwoode They there applied to different solictors, as in the case of t r. Tutner and instructed those socitors to write to cert in supphlose
debtors in London, by which means they would of course btain the handwriting of those solneitors, and bo able to go to their bankers with forged checks Mr. Hardsicke,befor he leftLondon, had ordered his letters to be sent io the : ame of Ralph to the Chapter Coffee-house, Paternosterrow. It turned out that the Cheptr Coffoe-house had been closed some time, but Hardnwicke went there and saw a party in the house, and he said that ho had been in the habit of having his letters left there, and the person said he wonld receive any letters that were addressed to Mr. Ralh. WeUl, he and Atwell ent downv to Yarmouth, and they applied to Mr. Chawmberlain, to Messr. eynolds and Palmer, and to Mr. Preston, all of whom were s1oicitors, instructing them to w-rit to persons in London for supposed debts Atwell woent on to Norwich, and there employed Messrs Miller and Son for a similar purpose. Letters wrere wrzitten to the supposed debtors in London. There wrere persons ready at the end of the journey to receive those letters. Mr. SawAard on the receipt of the letter from these several attorneys wFrote on the 3d of Sep. tember to each of them, complaining of the very harsh manner of his creditor, but premising that the debt should be aid. -These letters went to the solicitors and will ho
procucee in evidence. In duo time AtweU and Hardwicke came up to London, and the money for the amount of the supposed debts was paid into different banks in London to be forwarded to Yarmouth. On the 16th of September, at
a publihouso in Qaeen-street, Mr. Saward wroto threo letters to different attorneys informing them that he bad paid the money, and he returned to Atwell the letters of application which had beon written by tho attorneys at Yarmouth. Mr. Atwell and Mr. Hardwicke mnediately prceeded again to Yarmnouth, but an untoward circumstance occurred
which first led to suipicion, and afterwards to detection, to which I wil now call your attention. Mr. Hardv.icke, in order to keep up his credit At Yarmoutb, was anxious to pay a sum of 250! into the bank of Barclay and Co. to the credit of his. Ralph at Yarmouth. He aordingly went to Messrs Barclay and Co. and paid in the money in the name of Ur. Whitney; but,unfortunatelyfor him, he forgot topayitinas money to bo paaid to a Mr. Ralph. The money was therefore sent down to Yarmotuth to th crodit of Mr.
Whitney. Of course when Mr. Rsilph went to receive the money they said they had no money in that name in their hads, but had sue an amount to the credit t*f a Mr.
Whitney. This created great uneasiness, and Hardwicke wro,te to Saward under cover to MLr. Ralph at the Chaptar. coffee-house, giving an account of the unfortunate circuamstance which had oceurred, and requesting hi to interfere to get the matter rectified. Saward sent Antrson to Bsrclay and Co., but they romsed to pay the money upon the
representation he made to tbhm. and they required tnat mr. Whitney must attend himself and explain the matter. Thus this affair ended. In the meantiue suspicions bad been excited as to the conduct of twoell aud Hardwicko at Yarmouth, and an inquiry was set on foot, and those suspicions beame so strong that the eonaeqnnoe was both Atwell and Hardwicke were apprehended. On going to Atwell's lodg-
ings there were found all the letters which had bee *vritten by the attorneys at Yarmouth, anld which Saward 'ha-i given hack to Atwell wrhen he wrote the answers to
those l.tters. But a more unfortunate event occurred to Mr. SawardL On the l-oth ef September, 1S6 Mr. Sawai wroi4 a httbr to arwicke, ;ddv
ing him by the name of Ralph, in answer to Hard. wskSe respecting this unfortunate transaction as to the pay. nent oft emoney into Messrs. Barclay and Co.'s banl. That letter, arriving at Yarmouth after Hardwicke and Attwell had been apprebended, fell into the hands of the 'polle, and was opened and read by tlhem. It certainly appeared to them, not understanding all the extraordinary circumstances which I have detailed to you, a little amubiguous; but when the letter was brought to London, and as soon as it was shown to the solicitor for the prosecution, the difficulty was dispelled, and afforded a clue to the whole nrvatery. It explained everything, and the letter was of thu greatest importance as showing Saward's connexion with Anderson and the other parties. [Here Sir F. Thessiger read the letter, which was afterwards given in evidence.] As to the handwriting '4f that letter I shall have no difficulty in proving it to your satMifaction. Saward in the meantime, not seeing Hardwicke or hearing from hinb,, became uneasy, and he wrote a note and left it at Mr; Dixon's. He afterwards went there aud asked for Ilardwicke, upon which she told him, to his great surprise, that Hardwicke had been apprehended, and she asked what it was for, when he said
h, nothing ; the circrunstanco will be settled in a few days." HE told her that if any one camiie there and asked for Hardwicke she was to say that Mr. Hardwicke's letters were left therc, but that a lady came for them. Saward then asked whether any letters were in her possession. Two were produced, and on Saward saying, " I thinik yon had betterbu-n those letters," the mother of Mrs. Dixon said, "Perhapsthe gentleman had better bern them himself." Upon which Saward took the two letters and burnt them. Saward was apprehended on the 26th of December by two city officers named Moss and Huggett. They went to a coffeeshop in John-street, Oxford-street, w.here they inquired for a Mr. Hopkins, when a woman said that he had gone to a publichouse in Oxford-market. They went there. Huggett entered the house, Moss remained a little behind, and presently observed a door opened rather gently. He immediately opened the door fuRy, and found Mr. Saward there. He said, " My name is Hopkins." " No," said Moss, "your name is Saward." He said, " You are entirely mistaken," Shortly afterwards Moss said, " You are James Saward." Saward said, " I know nothing at all about him." Huggett then said, " I must apprehend you for forgery, for forgin a bill of 1,0001. upon Messrs. Reywood and Co., and with also being concerned with Anderson, Hardwicke, and Att. well-" Sa&smrd said, " I don't know any such persons." The officerst$en apprehended Saward. He shortly wanted to retire to the watercloset. Huggett said, " You may go, but before you do you must be searched." He was searched, and they took from him two blank checks of the St. James's branch of the London and Westminster Bank. Saward said to Huggett, " Of course, you have no desire to do anything with them." A little while after, as he was being taken in the cab, Saward said, *' I suppose I need not hold out any longer. My name is Jem Saward."
The pisoner Saward.-I said no such thing.
Sir i. TH1ESIGER.-I am merely stating the evidence which I am prepared to prove.
The prisoner Saward repeated that he never used the words attributed to him,
The CHIEF B,iRON.-It is very irregular to interrupt the counsel in that way. If it be not true that will appear by the evidence; but if it be supported by the evidence the jury will have to consider it, but this is not the time to do so.
The prisoner Saward.-But, my Lord, the evidenco may not be true.
The CHsBF BABoN.-But we must hear it before we can judge whether it be true or false; and before we can receive the evidence we must hear the narrative of the whole trans. action.
Sir F. TihSIGER.-Gentlemen, I believe I have most fairly, most faithfully, and most accurately detailed to you from beginning to end the whole of the evidence which I shall have to depend upon, and it is neither for me nor for the prisoner to judge of the weight of the truth of that evidence; that is amatter entirely for yote, gentlemen, and you will have the fullest opportunity of considering and weighing that evidence. You will observe, from what I have stated to you, that it mainly depends upon the testimony of those persone, Attwell and Hardwicke, who are implicated with the prisoners, and who are accomplices with them, and who, therefore, unless supported by testimony of credit, of course wiU not be able to establish a case against the Prisoners. Your duty wiU be to see whether there are circalstances in this case which confirm materially the evidence of Attwel and of Hardw icke, and which wil leave no doubt upon your minds that they have told you a true story. You can understand that it is not expected in cases of this kind that persons who are accomplices should be confimed in every statement they make. That in most cases would be impossible; but they must be confirmed upon such facts as will lead any man to the conclusion that the substantial part of their story, which perhaps might not be fully corroborated by other testimony, is true and faithful. In regard to the connexion between these and the other parties I need do no more, after the denial of Mr. Saward, than refer you to the astounding circanstances stated in that letter, or rather, I should say, those letters which were written by him upon the occasion of tho transactions at Yarmouth, and of which I have already intimated to you I shaU have distinct proof. I trust, gentlemen, ]yhave now discharged my duty faithfuUy. My object was to place before you a plain statement of the evidence that will be submntted to your jadgment and final decision. I will not press any particular part of it on your attention. You alone are the judges of its weight and tendency, and I feel that I should not be discharging my duty fairly to the public if I were to press unnecessarily any portion of those facts evidence in support of which will now be offered to your judgment.
Henry Atwell, the approver, was then called and examined by Mr. Serjeant BoDKINs.-In reply to questions he said,- I am at present a prisoner in Newgato under sentence of transportation for life. I was convicted for forgery, with a prisoner named Haidwicke. I know both the prisoners at the bar. I first became acquainted with Saward and was introduced to him by a person named Saunders, a smith, who lived in the Old-street-road. That is about 12 or 13 months ago. I at that time had a parcel of canceled checks and three blank checks in my possession. They were part of the produce of a burglary which had been cominitted. The checks were drawn by a person named Doe upon Barclay's bank. I had some conversation with Saunders about these checks, and, by his appointment, I was introdauced to Saward, to whom I showed them. Ee asked me if I knew where they came from, and I told him, and afterwards went and showed him where Mr. Doe lived. When I showed him Mr. Doe's premises ho said it was a smaU place, and he was afraid they would not get much out of it. I afterwards met Saward by appointment in the New-road, when he brought the blank checks filled up. He asked me if I did not think the forged signatures to the checks were a capital imitation of the original? I compared them with the canceUled checks and said they were very good-the cancelled checks were then destroyed. The checks now produced for 461. 15s. 6d. and 951. 17s. 6d. are the two checks I saw upon that occasion. I afterwardclwentto Leman-street, Whitechapel, and was introduced to Anderson, who Saward said was his " sender," and who had lodgings there. After a short conversation in the street Anderson went in to see a young iran who had advertised for a sitaation, and whose advertisemesnt he had answered. I saw the young miian there; his name was Draper. It was the same young man that I see now in court. That young man was sent to Barclay's with one of the checks that morning, and I followed him. He got the m uey and came back with it to Leman-street, and gave it to Anderson. Afterwards Saward, Anderson, and myself went to the Eastern Counties Railway. The gold we got from the check was shared among five of us-that is Saward, Anderson, and myself and two men called Tom and Fred. The notes were al given to Saward. At the Eastern Counties Railway we met a young man named Brown, and Saward gave him the other cheek for 951. I followed Brown as before, and saw hima
er gtting the money, go over London-bridge, instead of goib.g ackto the Eastern Counties Railway; upeon which I tapped him on the shoulder, and said I thought he was going the wrong way; when he made some excuse about not meaning to be dishonest, and came back. The money was given to Anderson. Afterwards S *ward tried to dispose of the notes. He was absent for about an hour, but then caine back and brought some gold. He had sold the 101.-notes for 8g. 10s. each. The whole money was themi shared among us. I got two shares for bringing the papers (checks), and I gave some to Saunders for the introduction to Saward. I was then passing by the name of Hawkes, and EliHabeth Evans was hving with me as my wife. My aunt, Mrs. Haydon, used sometimes to call upon me at my house in Cottage-lane. It was about two months after this affair of the first checks that Saward called on me. I recollect the presentation of a check on Smith Payne's. I saw Saward that day. He called on me and said he had "business' in hand, and asked me to join; which I did. I saw some cancelled checks in his possession in the name of Ash and Son, a forgery of one signature for 911. which appeared to be perfect. I knew the checks were theproduceof a burglary. They were to be sent to the bank as before, I following the messenger. I weut with Anderson and Saward to a publichouse in the City-road, when Anderson was dressed up in a wig as he used to be. A young man, Humphrey, came to Anderson's lodging at, Oakley-crescent, City-road, and was sent on an errand, and then to the bank. I saw him present the check at Smith Payne's. It was not paid, so I hurried back to prevent his meeting any of the others. After that Saward gave me a sheet of blank cheeks at my house in Cottage-lane, and told mae to take care of them as they would come in very i afuL nu-za , ~lsn vastocaef thm ion afery thatu
I met Saward, who called on me and told me he 'had a checkbook of a banker's in the Haymarket, and that they had taken lodgings, and were g9ing to present some checks if I would follow the young men as before. [A young man, named Powell, was here called into court, but the witness said he could not be sure as to his identity.] That was accordingly done on three occasions. I afterwards saw Saward near Shoreditch church, and he told me had got up a bill of exchange for 3811. 17s. 6d., purporting to be drawn by Jennings and Co. on Samuel Dobree and Co., mercbants, of Tokenhouse-yard, and made payable at Flankey's. That bill was sent by Anderson, who was disguised as usual, from the Hackney. road, by a young man named WizzRelL I followed him to the bank, and saw that the bill was not paid. I saw Saward write something upon the bill just before it was sent. I think it was the date on which it would become due. In consequence of an arrangement between Saward, AnderPon, and myself, I took an I 0 U for 301. to Mr. Turner, a solicitor in Rel Lion-square, to instruct hin to recover the money due on it, in order that we might get his check. I was to give the name of " Hunter " sothat Saward might be able to imitate the writing in filling up the check for 100.t Letters lere to be addressed under the naue of " Hesp" to A ndereoffs lodgings in the New-road. My brother took the mzoney to Mr. 'luarner'S when he wrote for it, and in a few days afterwards I called on tr. Turuer, and his clerk gave mue the money in cash. Saward said that that could ne,t be helped for once. About that time Saward introduced Hardwiske to me as an old friend of his who had just come from Aiustralia. Saward, Anderson, and myself went and nmet Hardwicko in Farring. don-market, and, after some convenestion as to getting more '"papers," we arranged to meet again the same , eveiog at a. publichouse inl Southwark- We called that ..hlouse " the Beef-house," as the landlord once sent for some
-cooked beef for us, as-ho had nothing in tbme house for us to eat. We used often to meet there. On one occasion
llardwicke showed some papers he had brought from Aus-
tyalia. They were blank forms of bils, which he saidi might be used for forgery. They were all given to Saward, who afterwards filled them up-one for 10001. and another for 900. I saw the former bill for 1,0004 on the morning it was presented. [Thobils'werehanded in and read bythe clerk of the court.1 About that time I was at a hatter's in Breadstreet, Cheapside, with Anderson and Hardwicke, when a, young man came in and said he was out of a situation and wanted one. Hardwicke followed and spoke to him, and afterwards told Saward that the young man wvas a likely young fellow to present cheeks. The young man was named Clements. oe was written to that evening, and Anderson took a lodging in the KCingsland-road, under the name of Rieley. On the morning the bill was presented we p ll met at a publichouse in the neighbourh ood. The young man Clements, who had been written to, was sent to get change at the bank for a 201.-note, and to bring in two 10s. bill stamps, which was done. One of those stamps was put on the back of the 1,00014 bil by Saward. who wrote the name Rieley and his address across it. I took the other stamp myself. Anderson then took the bill, and, disguised as usual, gave it to Clements, with whom 1 rode down to the city in a bus. Clements did not know me. I saw him go into Haywood's bank with the bill. Saward waited under the clock in Lombard-street. I went into the bank and saw that the money was stopped, and returned immediately and told Hardwicke and Saward, and we all went to the publichouse in Bishopsgate-passage, where we told Anderson, who was waiting, and t en separated. Afterwards we went and tried Ir. Turner again with another I 0 U. There were so many names used I can hardly recollect the name of the supposed debtor on that occasion, but I think it was Hart. Anderson took his lodgings in St. Pancras-road. I still kept the name of Hunter, and in a few days after the application Hardwicke paid 1001. to Mr. Turner for the supposed debt, for which I caDled, and got a check upon Gosling and Co., which I gave to Saward. In about an hour and a-half Saward returned the check back to me at a publichouse in Lincoln's-inn, telling me that he would soon have some blank cbecks, which had been got from Mr. Turner's pocketbook by robbery. The person who had those blank checks was with Us that morning, but had not the checks with bim. He is not now in custody. About that time several letters were written in answer to advertisements for situations, and Anderson took another lodging, under an amsumed name, in MIornington-crescent. Soon after Saward produced a forged check for 4101 7s. 4d., purporting to be drawn by Mr. Turner. Anderson took the check and gave it to a young man named Hardy to take to the bank. I foilowed him and saw him get the money, and on his return to Mornington-crescent Anderson met him and took the notes and gold. We then went to the Blackfriars-road to a coffeehouse to look for Hardwicke, to whom we disposed of eight 501.-notes which we had received for the check. He gave 351. each for them. The money was shared equally, and a share given to the person not in custody for the blank checks he had stolen from Mr. Tumer. I afterards went with Hardwicke to Hamburg, where we changed the 501.-notes. [At this stage of the proceedings the Court adjourned for a quarter of an hour for refreshment. On the return of the Jury the examination was proceeded with.]-About this time Hardwicke received a check from some one whose name I do not know, and he showed it to Saward, who said he had some blanks that would fit it nicely. Afterwards Saward produced some checks, one of which was for 504, and he asked Anderson to take it to the White Hart and send the " boots" there for the money. We subsequently arranged how it should be done at the Magpie in Bishopsgate-street, and I followed the messenger to the bank and followed him back to the Magpie, where Anderson land Saward were waiting when we returned. The money was paid in three 101.-notes and the rest in gold. I changed the notes for napoleons in Lombard-street. Another check for 1001. was then given to Anderson to send from the Four Swans. That money was also paid, and Saward took the largest share on account of his getting the blank checks. We arranged to send another check for 1004 next day from Gregory's Hotel, in Cheapside. I followed the messenger (Saunders)-now in court-to the banker's. Hardwicke gave me 50t, so that if the check was stopped and I was asked what business I had in the bank, I was to say I came to pay in the 504. to the credit of some one in the country. he third check was not paid, and I returned to Saward and Anderson immediately and told them of the fact. Soon after this I went to Yarmouth. Saward was aware of my going there. Hardwicke went down about a week before I did. He had a small check upon a banker then. Hardwicke passed under the name of Ralph, and I went under the name of Attwood. I went to several solicitors and employed them to write for supposed debts, as we had done with hMr. Turner. Among others we went to were Reynolds and Palmer, Chamberlain, MiUler, and Son, and Preston. The persons by whom the supposed dsbts were owing were represented as living in London. I received the written applications about the debts from Saward. We then came up to London, and I paid in some money on account of the supposed debts to a branch of the Royal British Bank in Thzeadneedle-street* and Anderson, I think, also paid in some money for the some purnose into Barclay's. The letters produced are in Sawar 'a handwriting. They are the answers to the solicitors' applications for the supposed debts. On the day we came up we all dined together-Anderson, Hardwicke, Saward, and myself-and shortly after that I was taken into custody.
Both prisoners having declined to put any question to this witness,
William Salt Hardwicke was the next witness called and examined by Mr. SnzIas.-He said-I [am a prisoner in Newgate, under sentence of transportation for life for forgery. Before this last charge I was transported for 10 years for a felony at Brighton, of which, however, I was not guilty. After my sentence I established myself in business n Australia, and afterwards returned to England. I have known the prisoner Saward about 20 or 26 years. I knew him well before the felony at Br:hton. Exactly this day twelvemonthe i took my passage home from melbourne withpmywfe, and arrved in England about the end of MIay, and took lod3igs in NTelson-square, Blackfriars-road. Soon afterwards I met Saward in Suffolk-street, and he asked me how long I had been in England, and why I bad not caUed upon him. I sacl d I had not een long home, and had no wish to cal upon him, as I thought he had treated me so badly He said I was not to mind that, as he would soon put me in a way of getting hack my passage-money. Eventually I agreed to meet him, and did so next daydbg appointment. he said he would introduce me to the par ties he was then working with, and so I became acqnanted with Anderson and Attwel We used to meet at a p ubechousewhich we called the "wBeef-house." When s came from Australia I brought some bills with me. I had one genuine bill for 2004h upon Kennard and Company.I showed some blank bills to Saward at the "Beef-honse," and he said e thought a good deal might be done with them.
He took away the genuine bil and t h blank forms, and the next day he returned me the genuine bill, and said he had done what he wanted with it. It was then arranged that I was to Jind al the money that was necessary, and that a forged bil should be presented through the medium of Anderson, who was known as the sender. Iwas present when the young man Coleman went into the hatter's shop, and I obtained his address, and it was arranged that he should be appthed to and employed to present the forged bil. A lodgg was taken by Anderson, where he was to meet the young man Clements, and he disguised himself by buttin
on a wig before he met him. We al went to a pubhchouse on the morning the billU as presented, and I gave a 201-note to Saward, and I saw him wFrite a name upon it. This witness then proceeded to narrate the particulars of what was done when Clements brought back the change of the 1.-note and the l -stamps, giving exactly the same account of the transaction as that given by the witness A ttbwel He also said that he was in the bank when the bim withregwaspresented, and he saw the clerk about to hand the banknotes to Clemenk;, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, andhe looked at the bill again and returned the notes to the till, and the messenger and the bill were detained. The witness then went on to give an account of al the other transactions that had been referred to b the witness Attwell, in nearly the same terms as were used

The prisoners put no questions to this witness.
Mr. Stubbs deposed that the prisoner Saward had lodged in his house for several years, and he stated that some of the letters that had been produced resembled the handwriting of the prisoner, to the best of his belief.

Mary Anne Smith proved that Anderson hired tho room in Leman-street, Whitechapel, under the name of Davis. Be only caine for an hour or two on three successive days and then left, and she saw no moie of him.
'Edward Brown, another young man who had advertised foY a situation, proved that he was sent by Anderson to Barclay and Co.'s with a check for 951. 17s. 6d., and he obtained the money. As he was returning a young man tapped him on the shoulder and asked him if he was not goig the wrong way, and he turned hack. IHe was merely going to make some inquiry relative to his character at the time he wras stopped. Attwel was the person who stopped
hm. He afterwards gave the money he received to AnderElizabeth Evans proved that in the early part of last year she was living with Attweli as his wife at Colege-lane, City-rond; and that the prisoner Saward frequently came there to see Attwell. Upon one occasion she said she saw Sa-ward produce some papers from his pocket that resembled banker's checks in size and appearance, and some checks were afterwards given to her by Attwell to take care of, and she identified some that were now produced as the same that were so given to her.
Elizabeth Hayden, the aunt of Attwell, proved that she had also seen Saward at her nephew's honse, and she had seen them conversing, and once when they were together she observed a roll of papers on the table before them.
Mr. C. F. Ash, a timber merchant in Upper Thamesstreet, proved that his premises were broken into last year, and that some cancelled and blank checks were stolen with other articles. The check for 91Z. that bad been produced was drawn upon one of the checks so stolen, and it was a foams Humphries, another young man who had advertised for a situation, proved that Anderson sent him to Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co. with the check for 91!. The check was not paid, and he saw no more of the prisoner until he was in custody.
Andrew Stevens, clerk to Messrs. Bramah and Co., proved that the firm kept an account with Messrs. Ransom and Co., and that these checks that were produced were forgeries. They had been paid by the bank.
One of the cashiers from Messrs. Ransom's proved that the checks referred to by the last witness were paid by the bank.
Henry George Vowels, another person who had advertised for a situation, proved that Anderson, who passed by the name of Bates, answered his advertisement, and sent him to Messrs. Ransom's with a check for 471. 16s., and he received the money and handed it to the prisoner.
John Wyzell gave similar evidence with regard to a bil for 3871. 16s. 10d. upon Messrs. Hankey and Co. The bill was not paid, and he was detained, and when he returned to the place where he had seen the prisoner Anderson he was not to be found. Anderson upon this occasion went by the name of White.
Mr. T. Grey, a clerk in the firm of Messrs. Dobree and Co., merchants, of Tokenhouse-yard, proved that the acceptance to the bill referred to was a forgery.
M r.W. Inkerall proved that the acceptance, "K ennard and Co.," to the 1,0001. bill was also a forgery.
John Clements proved that he was looking for a situation in June last, and apphed at a hatter's in Cheapside, and when he came out Hardwicke accsted him, and he after wards went to an address in the Kingsland-road, where he saw the prisoner Anderson, who passed by the name of Riley, and after some conversation he gave him b 201-note which he was to get changed, and to buy two 10s.-stamps, and he did so, and gave them and the change to the prisoner. Anderson afterwards gave him the forged bill for 1,0001., and he went to Messrs. Heywood's with it, and he was detained, and saw no more of the prisoner till he was in
MIr. VV. T. NichoDs, cashier at Hieywood and Co.'s, said he remembered the 1,C001. bill being presented. He had partly paid it, when some misgivings crossed him, and he stoppe the biU and theperson who had brought it.
By the CoJRT.-The first part of the signature was very much like thCgeuuine one, but the latter part was not so good. It was also required to be paid in 1001. gold, eight
0b notes, and five for 1001., and this struck him as being a rather extraordinary mode for a private person to receive such an amount, and the circumstance excited his suspicon
Mrs. Davis, the landlady of the Sussex Arms publchouse, in De Beauvoir-road, Eingsland, proved that on the day the 1,000. billwas presented four persons were at herhouse, but she could not say positively who those persons were. She had on other occasions seen Saward, Anderson, Attwell, and Hardwicke at her honse, but not all together.
Mr. Wilson, clerk to MIr. Turner, the solicitor, proved that Attwell applied to him to recover a debt from a person named Hesp, and that the asual proceedings were taken, and 30M. were paid, which sum he handed over to Attwell. He also prove at a dmir proceeding took place with reference to a supposed debt of 1031., and he afterwards gave a check to Attweil for the amount.
Mr. Turner proved that in Mlarch last he was robbed of his pocket-book while walking along the street, and that it contained some blank checks. The check for 4101. 7s. was drawn upon one of those checks, and was a forgery.
Evidence w7s then given that Anderson had represented the persons who were supposed to have owed the money to Attivel, and that he received the letter written byMr. Turner, making application for the amounts.
A clerk from Messrs. Gosling and Co.'s proved that he paid the check for 4101., and that Hardwicke was in the bank nt the time, and put some questions to him.
Hardy, another young man who bad advertised for a situation, proved that Anderson, under the name of Taylor, sent him with the check for 4101., and told him to get eight 50b-notes, and the rest in gold. He obtained the money and gave it to the prisoner.
Evidence was then given as to the payment of the two checks, purporting to be drawn by Mr. Baldwin for 1001. and 501. at Messrs. Hankey's. A third check was presented a day or two afterwards, but this was not paid.
Mr. Daniel Baldwin, of the firm of Smith and Knight, railway contractors, said it was his duty to sign the checks of the firm, and that those now preduced were forgeries.
The boots and porter of the our Swans and the Whito Hart, Bishopsgate-street, proved that they presented the two checks for 1001. and 501 at Messrs. Hankey's, and that they handed the money to the prisoner Anderson.
Mrs. Dixon proved that she was cousin to Hardwicke. She said that she knew the prisoner Saward as Mr. Sharp. (A laugh.) After sbe had heard of Hardwicke being in custody Saward came to her house and inquired if she had seen anything of Hardwicke, and she told him that the officers had searched Hardwicke's auartments in Nelson-square. He ap. peared very much suirpxsed, and asked her if she knew what he was detained in Yarmouth for, and at the same time said there was nothing of any consequence there, but there was no knowing what it might lead to. Be then asked if thero were any letters there for Mr. Hardwicke, and she gave him two letters, and he burned them, and said that if any one inquired if any letters had been left there for Mr. Hardwicke she was to say that some letters had been left, but that a lady had caUed for them.
Samuel Cole, barman at the Magpie publichouse, Bishopsgate-street, proved that Saward was at that house during the greater part of the day on which the two forged checks for 1001. and 501 were uresented. Anderson and Hardvicke were with him during some part of the time.
Mr. E J. Wimbush, the landlord of the Magpie, gave similar evidence.
A number of witnesses were then examined to show that the prisoners and Hardwicke and Attwell had been repeatedly seen together, and also that,Andersonhaduengagecl different lodgings in false names, and that he had obtained possession of the letters that were sent by the different attorneys at Yarnouth applying for the fictitious debts claimed by Attwell.
Mlr. IMorris, a clerk at Messrs. Barclay' proved that on the 11th of September Hardwicke paid in a sum of 2501 in the name of Whitney, to be transmitted to Yarmouth through their agents, Messrs. Gurney. A few days afterwards Anderson made an applcation respecting the money, and wished that it should be paid to a person named James Ralph, at Yarmouth, and he said that Whitney had gone to Germany.
John Moss, a city police-officer, deposed that on the 26th of December he went to an eating-house in John-street, Oxford-street, accompanied bv Huggett, another officer, for the purpose of looling after the prisoner Saward. He inquired for Mr. Hopkins, and was told that he was just gone out, and that be would be found at a publichouse in Oxford-market. Huggett went to the place indicated and witness remained behind and in a short time he observed a door in a room of the hack opened very gently, and he immediately went in and found the prisoner Saward in the room. He said to him,
. Hopkis, I have been looking for you," and he
is not Hopkins." Witness said, "No, I he was mistaken. Witness then told him that he charged
him Withl being concerned with hiwo-othber -pers'o'ns named Hardwicke and Attwell in forging a bill of exchange for 1,000L, and that he mnust go to the city with him. The prisoner replied that he knew nothing about it. By this time Huggett, his brother officer, had returned, and they were about to leave,
when the prisoner wished to go to the watercloset. Witness told him he might go, but he must search him first, and he did so, and found two blank checks upon the St. James's branch oftheLondonand Westminsterank in hispossession. When he took them from him the prisoner said. " Oh, they are nothing, destroy them." After this the prisoner expressed no desire to go to the watercloset. As they were going along in the cab the prisoner said, "Well, I sTpose it is no use holding out any longer, I am Jem Saward. '
Saward here asserted that he never made use of this expression, and said that all along he had emphatically denied having done so.
EHugett, the other officer, corroborated the evidence given oy Moss, and this concluded the case for the prosecu-
The prisoners did not put a single question to any of the witnesses, and when they were asked if they wished to make any defence they both replied that they had nothing to say, Saward adding that he left himself entirely in the hands of the Court.
The CHIxs BARoN then summed up, reading over carefully the evidence given by the witnesses Hardwicke and AttwelL, and pointing out whe theywere confirmed by the other witnesses. eete eecnimdb h
The jury were only in deliberation five minutes, and they then returned a verdict of Gltilty against both prisoners,
Sir F. TxsIQEs said he was instructed by the Banker
Association, who were the prosecutors, to state on behalf Of, Anderson that there was reason to believe he had been made a tool of by others, and also that he had given important assistance in getting up the prosecution..
The CMTx BAuoN said he should postponeping sen Tnce until to-morrow (this day).
The Court then adjourned at 7 o'clock.

Mr. Raily. Mr. Glasse, and F. Nalder appeared for the plaintiff, and opposed the motion.
The VICHCA CKLLop said that if he could find autho. rity for what was asked he should be happy to grant the motion, but the utmost he could do was to say that the plaintiff should not use these affidavits. Lord Wellesley appeared to be resident habitually in Paris, but not to be detained there by any indisposition or incapacity. The granting the motion, however, would be laying down a role where none before existed, which he (the Vice-Chancelor) had much rather that the Lord Chancellor should do. All that he could do was to refus the motion * costs to be costs in thecause.
(Before Fice-ChanceMor Sir W. P. WooD.)
ISEADE V. fNLEKv.xy
Mfr. ROLT (Mr. Faber with him) moved on behalf of the plaintiff, Hr. Charles Reade, the author, for an injunction to restrain the defendant, the well-known publisher, from publishing a cheap edition (recently advertised) of the work caUed Peg Woffington, or any reprint or new edition of that work, without the sanction and consent of the plaintiff. By an agreement entered into between the plaintiff and defendant in November, 1852, it was agreed that the defendant should publish at his own expense and risk the work called Peg Woffington, and that, after deducting the produce of the sale thereof, the charges for printing, paper, advertisements, embelUishments (if any), and other incdental expenses, including the allowance of 10 per cent. on the gross amount of the sale for commission and risk of bad debts, the profits remaining of every edition printed should be divided into two equal pacts, one moiety to be paid to the plaIntiff and the other to belong to the defendant; the bookssold tobe accounted for at the trade sale price reckoning 25 copies as 24, unless it should be thought advisable to dispose of any copies, or of the remainder, atalowerprice, this being left to thejudginent *nd discretion of the defendant. This agreement was in a printed form, filled up in writing where necessary. Since its execution one edition of Peg Woffigntor. had been published at 10s. 6d., being the price agreed upon between the plaintiff and defendant, who, being anxious to publish a cheaper edition at 5s., mentioned his wish to the plaintiff who declined to give any consent to such publication. The defendant, however, has lately advertised in several newspapers the immediate publcation of a new edition of Peg Woffington, at 3s. 6d., niform with It is Never too Late to Mend. Notice having been given br the plaintiff's solicitor to the defendant not to publish this or any new edition of the book, and a subsequent notice of dissolution of the partnership (if auy) under the agreement of November, 1852, having also been served upon the defendant, the present bill was filed, and an interim order obtained last week, which it was now sought to continue.
Mr. W. ML J.asxs and Mr. W rTBiREAD opposed the motion for Mr. Bentley.
The whole discussion turned upon the construction of the agreement, reference being made on both sides to the case of " Stevens v. Benning," some time since decided by his Honour, that decision having been since confirmed by the Lords Justices on appeal.
The VIcx-CHANCxLOR, after expressing his regret that argreements of this kind should be framed with so little attention to precision, said that he felt more convinced than he had done in the case of " Stevens v. Benning" that under the areement now before him there was no intention to part with the copyright. The real difficulty was the true construction of the agreement, and how far the plaintiff was entitled to prevent the defendant from publishing any edition of the work, at any price he hked to fix. The agreement was wholy silent as to the person by whom the price was to be fixed. If MIr. Reade had intended to retain this power in bimself, it would have been very easy to express it. But Mr. Bentley was to be the publisher of the work at his own risk, and certain charges for matters entirely within the publisher's province were to be deducted before any division of profits. The very business of a publisher was to make expenses and profits balance; he ws the person to whom the author generally looked in al such matters, and he (the publisher) was therefore the proper person en whom the duty of fixing the rrice ought to devolve. Mr. Rolt had suggested several difficulties; one that it could never have been intended to give the sole management to the publisher, who might if he were so iclined, introduce absurd embellishments into the work not calculated to increase its reputation, and might so arran e his price as to secure to himself the 10 per cent. commission on the gross amount of sale, without leaving any substantial profit to the author. The answer was that authors took care of these matters by going to a respectable publisher, and that it was as much the interest of such publisher as it was of the author that the work should pay. The only serious question under the agreement was how far the plaintiff was at liberty to determine the contract of partnership. Expenses had already been inenrred by the defendant in advertising and getting ready for publication the edition now sought to be restrained. It was said by the plaintiff that these expenses were incurred without his consent and cognizance, but the true construction of the agreement being, in h-i Honour's opinion, that Mr. Bentley might fix the price, and was not bound in law to communicate on that suhject with the plaintiff, he (the plaintiff) could not have any rightto determine the contract tllU the expenses of this edition had been recouped to the defendant, and the profits realized by the sale of such edition. With reference to future editions, it would be necessary for the plaintiff, if the construction thus put by the Court unon the agreement were correct, to tak-e steps for the dissoluion of the partnership before expenses should have been incurred by the defendant in preparing for any future edition.
The presentmotion was WrOng, and must be refu.sed with

It appeared that the George, after getting clear of the Pensher, was brought up with one anchor, from which she parted in a gale, and went on shore, where she sustained still furtber damage.

Mathews ws now in receipt of 4,1601. per annum, under an agreemeut with Mr. F.. T.Suith, the lessee of Drury-lane Theatte, or some one on hig behalf. Mr. Mathews was a widower without family, and, with such ample means, it was submitted he could well afford to set aside a portion of his income for the benefit of his creditors.
Mr. Commissioner PmTrs inquired whether the income mentioned was secured to Mr. Mathews ?
Mr. SARGOOD replied that it was believed there was an agreement on the_ Art of Mr. Smith to pay 801. a-week, upon condition of hr. Mathews performing at Drury-lane, or some theatre in the united kingdom. Mr. Mathews was heard and discharged at LIncaster in Agust last.
The learned voxofssro.ym thought enough had been stated to jusfy a rule nis.

MIr. wontner appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner was committed for trial.
BoW-switzEm.-Mr. JARfDI;E hbu received the half of a 6l1-note under the signature, "*e was a Thief and had the Rag."
IARLronoircn-TsnrE.--Chrrles Clark was charged with obtaining money from Lord Ftederick Calthorpe, of Grosvenor-square, by false and fraudulent pretencs.
LodC&althorpei,-The JuonerinJe last introduced himnelf to me as Dr. DomviDe, of Southwark, and represented that he was in the hxbit of giving medical advice and assistance to poor people in the district gratuitously lnt as his means of doing good were limited he was oblged to ask the assistance of the benevolcnt in cases of a deferving character. The prisoner then proceeded to detail the case of axpr woman, for whom he said he was interesting himself, Believing the prisoner's statemevt I gavo the pretended doctor a sovereign without having mado previous inquiry. I mentioned tie circumstance at tho Mlendicity Society's-offioe a few days afterwards and then I was informed that I had been imposed upon
John Horaford, ono of the society's corsthl,s know the prisoner. Heapprehended him thxt morning just as ho came out of prison, where he had been confined for, asimilar offence.
Remanded till Saturday.
Charles Howell, a person of very rcsrpctable appearance, was charged with obtaining a quantity of valuable property from Mr. John Bishop, watchmaker, of 4, North AudDeystrcet, by fraudulent repsentation.
Mr. Fisher was for the prosecution, Mr. Lewis for the prisoner.
Mr. Bishop said in December last the prisoner callid at his shop and said toi wanted his watch repaired. The watch and the chain, which were produced, had been originally sold by him to a gentleman named Vernon for 311. 10. The prisoner was told to call in a fortnight, and at his request he was accommodated with a watch to wear in the interval. The prisoner said he should require a good watch, to mako a present to his Pon who was abroad; but as his wifle's tasto was more in unison with is son's than his was he would prefr that she should make the selection. The prisoner further remarked that he did not think he ishould be able to psy for the watch at the time, as the rents from his estate at Riverhead did not come in very freely, and he was building outhousec which took away all his rcady money. The pnsoner also informed him that he lived at present at No. 3 Comtn-terrace, igbbury, having taken t eouse taere to give hiswife the, bnfit of superior medical advice. The prisoner called a few days afterwards and requested him to send somewatches forhis wife to select from. ne sent about 2001. or 3001 worth of watches. They were returned, as well as the watch which had been lent to the prisoner. A short time after this the prisoner called on him, and said he would purchase the watch lent to him for his daughter if complainant would put his name on it. He agreed to do so, and the prisoner said when this was done he would hate a chain put to it. The prisoner came again in aL few days and selected a gold chain, which, with the watch, came to 201. IQs. Complainant Ws induced to partwitlihis property on the representation of the prisoner that he had an estate at Riverhead, in Rent, and that his moneys would not come in until Christmas. On the 3d of February theprieonercalled, and said he should dispose of his own watch to a friend, who had taken a fancy to it, and he should require another one to replace it. Complainant showed him a gold chronometer, value 251., and the prisoner asked if he might havo a trial of it for a few days. He ceonsented to this, and the prisoner, after selecting a gold chain, value 1014, took tho property away, promising to call on Saturday. The prisOner called on that day, and gave a reference to Captain Chiches. ter, of the United Service Club and to Mr. O'Kcefo, Beakstreet. The prisoner also gave him a bill for 25L, drawn by himself on Mr. OMiller, of Argyll-place, on Me.ssrs. Smith, Payne, and Co., but on inquiry the prisoner wvas not known there. He went to Compton-terrace and found the houso shut up. He went to Riverhead, but could find no estate answvering the description wvhich the prisoner gave of his
p1jerty. said, he expected to be in a position to prove that the prisoner wasa *respectable person.
MSr. BiNosias said, as the evidence stood he Ehould certainly remand the prisoner for a week.
WnsnrmsTERx-A few weeks ago a woman named Sarah Allen was chbarged at this court with stealing a piece of plaid from a linendraper's door. She appeared to have seen
etter days, and after stating that she had been wandering about the streets, uncared for by the world, and, from her abiectpoverty and wretchedness, an object of disgust to herself, told the magistrte that if she had a chance she would take the coat off his own back sooner than remain as she thenr was. Mr. PAvsri remarked that she appeared to have received a good education, and directed tho police to see whether they could ascertamin anything about her; but as she refused to give them the slightest clue they were unsuccessful, and she was committed for a month, at the expiraton of which time she promised to wait upon the magistrate and be moro communicative. True to her word, she yesterday appeared before MIr. PAsINTER, and reminding him of her committal, caid that she nowv aplied to him for assistance to prevent her falling into crime
again.
Mr. PAm riTsR reminded her that she had refused to givo any account of herself, or information respecting her friends, by which inquiries might be instituted, wlhen previously before him,
Applicant.-I have not a single relation or friend that I know of in the wide world.
Mr. PAYNTER.-Are you a married woman?
Applicant.-Yes, I am, but deserted by my husband. I will tell yon my history. There is not a creature I know that woud give mea cup of tea. I was well brought up. and when first married comfortable, but my husband took to play, became an inveterate gamester, was ruined, and went abroad 15 years ago, I worked at my needle for years, and earned-as needlewomen do-but a scanty subsistence after all my toil. I made fancy goods and sold them, and I havo now come to solicit you to give mo the means of doing the same again.
Mr. PAmr d-.Tudglng by the statement you mado when before me a month ago you do not seem to have been very successful At last.
Applicant.-I was successful for years, and in all probability should never have seen you but for a cruel robbery committed upon me. I mado fancy goods and sold them at watering-places and elsewhero. I travelled tbe country with them. One unlucky day I slept with my little stock at Wisdsor, and in tho night was cruelly robbed of it. That is the cause of my being before ou. Buy me a basket, replenish my stock, start me on the road to Brighton, and I then may b enabledto live honestly awain.
The worthy magistrate kindly acceded to her reqjuest, and, under the care of Knowrland, tho summoning otlficer, she wvas soon set on her road to Brighton with .e stock in trade and a tri'de in her pocket.
WOnSnP-SMTEXT.-Ellen Troy, a co arse, ill-favoured younDg woman, wras charged on a warrant before Nr. HIAMSIILL with tho following abominable outrage upon a decentlooking married woman named Jane Carey living on Yorkterrace Kingsland:-
On tie 17th of last month the prisoner committed a brutal assult upon the complainant, who took out a summons against her for it, which was returnable on the 24-h. On that day the pnsoner did not mako her appearance, and it was therefore adjourned for a week, but the very day before she bad this time to attend she made the attack npon the unfortunate complainant which was now under consideration. The poor woman's right eye was black and swollen, the result of a serious blow inflicted upon her forehead, anid one of her arms was so covered with contusions from the shoulder to the elbow that at firz,t view it seemed to be in a state of mortification. These latter injuries sbe accounted for by stating that her husband bad cruelly beaten her on finding that the prisoner was in custody for assaulting her, and a bummons is now therefore out for the man's apprehension. As to the last assault she said :-I live with my husband, but, as ho will not work, I have to support him bvy what I can earn as a laundress, though I may say that he is pretty nigh alwvays cohabiting with the prisoner, who lives in the same neighbourhood. On the evening of the 2d inst. I was returning home, when I met the prisoner, wbo abused mo shamefully, struck me, tore my bonnet off, and ran towards my house. I was afraid to go home, as I thuoghr I should find her there, and I therefore asked a constahle axnd a married woman, a neighbour named Cathrall, to go with me. They did so, and wrhen I got home I found my husband and the prisoner there together and a valuable lookingglass lying on the carpet smashed all to pieces. The prisoner acenowledged she had broken the glass, but my hnsband woulld not give her in charge, and she tbreatened me, if I did, that she would niurder n.e. The policeman at last left the house, and tho moment he had done so the prisoner seized a poker and struck me so violently on the head with it that I fell back into mv friend's arms, and on putting up my hand to my head tha blood poured down into my slaeve. I called "lurder I' but became senseless, and on recovering was taken byian officer to a surgeon's. I never gave the prisoner any provocation, and don't know why sbe trea-s me in this way, unless it is to get rid of me, that she may have my husband to herself. She met me laWt night as'aio, and on seeing the state to which she had reduced one of my eyes threatened that she "w wonld have my other eye yet."
M'Culloch, 85 N.-I accompanied the complainant to her house, and heard the prisoner say what sbe states. After I
had JeSft I beard a fearful scream, sazd oni running hack I foulnd the complainant insensible and bleeding prou-ely.
Sarah Cathirall, the woman referred to by complaina-at, confirmed her evidence in its chief particulrrs, he.ring the prisoner declare she would have the wift-'s life and a certificate was produced from Mr. Coward, the divisiona surgeon, desribing the injury on the woman's head as hav-inz been inflicted with some obtuse instrument, and apparently a poker.
Prisoner.-I never strcko her with a poker.
Mr. HAmau,sIr-This is avery bad case indeed, and I shall send you for triea for it.
The prsoe was thierefore committed for the complet'on of the depositi'ons.

WESTERN CIRCUIT.
WINCHESTER, MARCH 5.
CROWN COURT.-(BCfore Ar. Justice WILLIAMS.)
James Johnson, who was convicted yesterday of etabbing a warder at the convict prison at Portsea with intent to iaurder him, was this morning brought up for judgment.
His LoRDSIIP told the prisoner that he had been convicted upon the clearest testimony of this most grievous act, and his own savage and brutal statement had corroborated the testimony given against him. Judgment of death 'would be recorded against him, and he would be dealt with as Her Majesty might think proper.
This sentence created great surprise. Persons say that the majesty of the law has not been vindicated. This prisoner has already been convicted of a similar offence. He told the Judge but yesterday that he would seize the first opportunity to kill the vwarders, or to rid the world of them, and y et his life has been spared. The prisoner is evidently a most dangerous character, and, if possible, w ill yet do harm. The trial here has been a complete farce, for the o?riginal punishmentto which he was sentenced has not been increPsed.
William Wallace was indicted forstabbing William Kelly, with intent to murder him.
Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Bullar were counsel for the prosecution.
On the 16th of February Kelly, who was a prisoner at the convict establishment at Portsea, was going round with one of the warders to collect the knives from the prisoners. When they came to the prisoner's cell Kelly put in his arm with the kuife-box; the prisoner stabbed him in the arm with the knife he had. The prisoner was secured, and he said he had not made up his mind for nothing since honday, for Kelly had always caled him names. The knife was afterwards found secreted behind the prisoner's bed; it had been zharpened at the point. The governor of the establishment asked the prisoner if he had intended killing Kelly. He said he meant to do it, for Keily had been taunting him and setting men against him.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty of the capital charge.
The prisoner then said that he had not intended to kill Kelly, but merely to stab him, in order that he might be ilogged and sent back to the separate cells, as he was leading SO miserable a life.
The JUDGE ordered judgment of death to be recorded against the prisoner.
[We are told that another case of this kind has occurred 'nthin the last few days.]
George Massam was indieted for shooting at Ann Hurley, ,with intent to kill and murder her.
Mr. H. T. Cole prosecuted.
The prisoner had been living at Southampton with Ann Hurley. She was about to leave him, at which he appeared to be much distressed, and he told another girl that if Hurley determined to leave him he would kill her, and he produced a pistol. The girl, who had been out, returned to the house, and the pnsoier then sid to her he would kil Ler if she persisted in leaving him. She said she certainly should go. The prisoner then pulled out the pistol and said he would kill her. She asked for time to say her pray. ers, and she knelt down. The prisoner, who was crying, asked her if she was ready. She said she must be if he was determined, and he then loaded the pistol with shot, and while she was kneeling before him he shot her in the breast. The prisoner then tried to make Isis escape. It was shown that the girl had greatly aggravated the prisoner.
The jury returned a verdict of Guilty with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Sentence deferred.

(Before Mr. Baron M3ARTIN.)
STOKOE V. SINGERS.
Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty were for the plaintiff; Mxr. Temple, Q.C., and Mr. Walters for the 4defndant.
The plaintiffs were Frances Ann Stokle and Mary Stokoe, and the defendant EHugh Singers, and the declaration contained two counts, the farst for obstructing certain windows and apparatus in warehouses and premises in the occupation of certain tenants of the plaintiffs, by which the plaintiffs' reversionary interest was injured; the second count claimed the same right in respect to the fpremises, but stated them to be in the occupation of the plaintiffs themselves. The -defendant pleaded " Not Guilty," and denied the right of access of light as to the proprty in question.
Mr. KSOWLES said the plaintiffs were sisters, and devisees in trust for sale, under the wiU of Mr. Samuel Stokoe, formerly a wine-merchant in Newcastle, and he died possessed of certain property in the Close, a plan of which he proecd. He would trace the history of the property -rom 100, and show it bad windows for the admission of light and air, and bars of wood or iron. The property was used as a bonded warehouse, and in 1837, when the tea trade had been thrown open, a cargo of tea was brought into this warehouse, and to exclude the weather the windows -were fllled up with slates, &c. Mr. Stokoe died in 1852, and 13y his wiU left this property to his sisters in trust to sell. 'The defendant afterwards purchased property opposite, and then the windows in the plaintiffs' property were opened.
Ulpon that, the defendant builtup quite close to the windows, and blocked them up; and the action was brought to -vindicate the right interferred with by these obstructions.
At the close of the plaintifts' case,
Mr. TEmrvL aeked his Lordship whether he thought he -ought,to go to thcjury?
Hls LORDSIiP said he was clearly of opinion that there hiad been no abandonment of right.
Mr. Th3prLE then addressed the jury, and submitted that -vhere windows had been closed for 1S, 20, or 25 years, ,parties buying property in the neighbourhood naturally bought it under the idea that the right had become extinct. Me would call witnesses to show that the windows had been closed for a much,longer time than that spoken to by the witnesses-for the plrintiffs.
At the close of Mr. Temlple's address, it bring after6 o'clock, -the Court adjourned-il 9 o'clock next morning, his LoRD'SHIP intimating that he would himself view the property previous to the sitting of the Court.
MARCH 4.
The case was resumed this morD ing, and as many as 20 witnesses were examined for the defendant, al deposing that for more than 20 years the six windows in question had been entirely closed. The jury then expressed a wish to -view the buildings, und-eventually brought in their verdict for the plaintiffs.
TIPOIND v. TrlE MAYOF., ALDERMEN, AND sURGEOSES OF
NEWC,tTLE-ON. TY-L
Mr. Temple, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty were for the plain.tiff; and Mr. Knowles, -Q.C., Mr. 'Unthank, and Mr. Seymour for the defendainC-
This was an action for atrespass in breaLing and entering -the house of the plaintiff, and for damage to his furniture, goods and pawnbroker's -pledges therein; and a second count compiained of a eimllar in=ury caused by pulling down .an adjoining house. The zsfendants had paid l. into -court.
It appeared that by an Act -of Parliament passed in 1850 -for regulating Newcastle, powers were given to the corporation authorizing them to bibu property and form a new street from St. Nichalas-Ohurch to the High Level Bridge, anoa that plaintiff's hoese was roquired for the purpose. In October, 1854, -he recewied a notice to quit in the following Xay, hut, as he was a yearly tenant, he could not be required to -leave until the '1st of August, the period at which he entered en his -tenancy, and he p aid no attention to the notxice. On the 21st of May, 1855, -the plaintiff wag awoke -by - crash, as he said -of a housefalling, and ongetting -p found that the gable of one Edward Logan's house -had fallen, and that the -corporation workmen were taking -laintiff's goods out of h2is warehouse, whioi was oer the otable. lLfhey further proceeded to pull his house down, taking off the roof, and the plaintiff had to get a van and remove his things consisting of forfeited pledgoes and goede pawned withl hinm. most of which were muche dam-ged in the removal, and his fixtures broken, besides losing muoh property. For the defendants, it was shown that the plakitiff had declined to inform them when his tenancy expired, so that they were quite iguoraut of the day of his entering on his yearly tenaney, and Mr. Bryson, the town surveyor, was called, who declared plaintiff's story was a fabrication, and that they had not touchied his houso until June, 185-5. when plaintiff had left it It might be that the plaintiff had removed his things in May, in co.rsequerce of the accidenit, being fearful that his 'house wa'uld EzIl. The ea-man Was called who removed the pla;ntiff,tbings, Ad he stated the house had not then been toucebd, that there was n3o furniture in the rooms, and that, the ciling was untouched. A woman who had 'helped the plaintiff to remove siaid it was by reason of their fright. It Alto aPPeared that the plaintiff had not detuanded comapensa. -tion until April, 1856, bein- nearly a year Afterwards.

I al:ENTRAL CARTINAL COUlRT, arch 5.
NEW COIURT.
(Before t Re oRCDER.)
Edwin Hammond surrendered to take his trial for the manslaughter of Richard CottrelL
Mr. Payne prosecuted, and Mr Phillipps defended.
It appeared that upon the night of the 31st of January the deceased and a friend were passing King's-cross, when the prisoner and two other men came up and assaulted them, the prisoner knocking the deceased down, and his head coming upon the kerb his skull was fractured, from the effects of which he died a week afterwards.
Mr. PIrILLIPrS, for the defence, called evidence to sbow that the assault was not the cause of the fall, but that it was in consequence of the state of the streets, which at that time were covered with snow and ice.
The jury, after hearing some evidence called by Mr. Payne to disprove the offence, returned a verdict of Guilty, with a recommendation to mercy.
He was sentenced to one month's imprisonment.
William Henry, 29, tailor, and Thomas Henry, 24, labourer, were found Guilty of receiving a quantity of artficial flowers, the property of Theophilus Bergeran.
The property', which had been left at the door of a warehouse inthe city, was taken away hy some one unknown, ndthe prisoners a few hours afterwards were found in possession of it. Thero were two other charges against them.
The Court sentenced them to two years' imprisonment.
John Ward, alias Needhams, said to be an officer of the m-ilitia, wzas indicted for a misdemeanour.
It appeared that being in an omnibus where there was only one lady he conducted himself with the grossest indecency.
The jury found him Guilty, and he was sentenced to nine months' imprisonmnent.
THIRD COURT.
(Before the CO,fl5ON-SERJEA.ST.)
The greater portion of the day was occupied in this court in disposing of the remainder of the Mint charges. The list has been a long one, and the cases most unusually heavy, the learned Common Serjeant having beeu entirely en,gged since Tuesday morning in trying them.
The only remaining case possessing any feature of public interest was that of a man and his wife, named George and Emma Smith, who stood indicted for coimnig.
Superintendent Brennan, it appeared, went upon the 21st of February to Long-lane, Bermondsey, and there, after breaking open the door of a room with a sledge-hammer, found the two prisoners engaged in making counterfeit shilings, there being an entire apparatus and numerous broken moulds in the room where the prisoners were.
The jury Acquittd the woman, and the man was ordered to be transported for life.
Henry Green surrendered to take his trial for perjury, committed before George Clive, Esq., the judge of the Southwark County Court.
Mr. Locke prosecuted and Mr. Robinson defended.
It appeared that the defendant was a small shopkeeper in Southwark, and inI850 became the tenant of a personnamed Judd, a baker, and Judd having taken the busmess of the defendant's previous landlord, defendant, who was in expectation of coming into some property, promised Judd that if he would let him live rent free he would, when he came into his property, put Judd into a good way of business. Defenuant used to sell things to the patients of Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospitals, and for that purpose had goods from Judd. After living with Judd for two years, and not coming into his property, Judd requested from defendant some acknowledgment of the debt, and to go on paying rent as before. This the defendant agreed to, and spoke to a person named Long, who drew up an I Q U for defendant, signing defendant's name to it, and this the defendant gave to Judd. In 1854 Long went to Australia. In May last year Judd asked defendant about settling his claim, and finally brought his action in the Southwark County Court, and produced the I 0 U for 151. 15s., which defendant denied having given. This was the perjury assigned.
The jury found a verdict of Guilty, and sentence was deferred.

Court Of Common Council.
COUBT OF COMMfON COUNCIL.
THE VOTE AGAINST XNI%TER_R_
Yevrtday a Court was held for the despatch of public business.
Deputy RATIHBONE said he thought it incumbent upon the Corporation of London, after so important a decision s that to which the House of Commons had come upon the Chinese question, to take into consideration the propriety of adopting measures to support Her Majests Ministers in the eourse they had pursued. (Hear, hear.) He would suggest that the Lord Mayor should either call a public meeting of the merchants and bankers of London, in conjunction with the members of the corporation, ordetermine upon some other form of assembling the commercui andtradinginterestain defence of the policy of Lord Palmerston. He did not care in what shape his Lordshipimight think proper to have the subject introduced, so that it might be brought forward as soon as possible.
Mx. DE JFRuEy said that if the merchants and bankers thought it necessary to take the question into consideration they could at once proceed to do so without any reference to the corporation. (H ear, hear.) It was not, he believed, the custom for the corporation to come forward in support of Ministers under such circumstances as those in which Lord Palmerston was placed.
Deputy DATIN said if ever a crisis could justify departure from general custom that crisis had arrived. (Hear, hear.) He believed it was the general opinion that a step more likely to be dangerous than that which had been taken by those who opposed the Government upon the Chinese question could not bave been resorted to, and certainly there was occasion for great and active sympathy. (Hear,
Mr. BLAxRE suggested the suspension of the standing order, that the Court might at once enter upon the discussion.
Mr. WooDTHOR3' (the clerk of the court) said the custom of the Coart stood in the way of discussion and that there was no standing order to be dispensed with.'
The LORD MAYOR said he could not help thinking that some damage might arise from the present discussion of the subject, but (as we understood his Lordship) he would most willingly receive a proposition in the usual form from the members of the Court
It was in the course of the day intimated that a Cout would be shortly held, for the purpose of bringing forward resolutions upon the subject.
RRFOR.%ITORY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND.
Mr. Dr JERSEY brought up the following report "on the reference to watch the progress of the Reformatory Schools Bill in Parliament:-
"We whosenamesarehereuntosubs.ed5 ofyourPazllamentary.Llw, and City Courts Committee to whom on the 18th dayef February last it was refered to consider a tiln to facilitate the establishment of ': fornrstory Schools in England,' and to report theren. do certify tbat Mr. Remenmbmancer. baving laid a copy of the said Bll before us, we proceeded to contider the same, Lnd find that it proposes to enable the justices of the peace of any county in general orqquarter sessions, and the council of any borough included inthe rchedulestotheAct,to

*That yourcommittee, being of opinion that it is deirable loer bon. Court should base the power, if they thint proper, to eat

speciduly submtted.

T. J. HOLT, FRED. FARRAR, CHEARLES H5OGG."
Mr. DE JERsEY, having moved that the Court agree with the committee in their report, and that the report be referred back to the committee to be carried into execution,
Deputy BowER said it would be inconsistent in the Court to agree to such a recommendation as that given by the comemittee.
Mr. ELLIOTT wished that the question of the reformatory schools had been passed over in silence by the corporation altogether, and that more compassion was felt for the pockets of the poorly-fed ratepayers He condemned in mdignant language the contrast which the meagre provision made for honest poverty afforded to the indulgence with which thieves and robbers were entertained, and expressed his sincere regret that everythmg calculated to encourage crime had become the infatuat3ion of the day. (Hear.)
Alderman ROSE thought the Court would compromise its independesce by assuming such a position as that in which the recommendation was calculated to place them. He believed that the advocates of reformatory schools began at the wrong end. The great want was the want, not so much of refolmatory schools or gaol improvements for criminals as of places of recreation and amusement for those who were not violators of the law. It was no wonder, he said, that crime had become so rife in the metropolis when such care was taken to coddle up the most dangerous and deg ed characters. He was for preventing the poor from
g criminals, and he Vas sure the present plan formed no part of a system of general good. He should therefore move as an amendment that the report'be referred back to the committee for reconsideration. (Bear, hear.)
Deputy PEVTRFSS supported the views taken by MTr. Elliott and Alderman Rose, and spolre in terms of bigh traise of the decisive mode of personal investigation taken y the Lord Mayor. He urged upon the Government the necessity which existed for giving employment to the destitute. Employment was what was wanted. Reformatories presented apremimto crime and, surelywben there were, as ad been stated by high authorities, 5,000,000 acres of land in want of cultivation and capable of being cultivated, all restrictions as to the work ought to be removed.
Mr. AnRAiMAM expressed rise at hearing such opposition made to what was coniered by the ablest philan. thropists a plan of reforming our criminal population likely to produce the most excellen' and the most paramount effects. He agreed, of course, that it was a permanent object to prevent crime, but he little expected to hear .he efforts made to reform those who had already committed crime undervalued in that assembly. The object was to turn away from guilt those who had been guilty, and to teach them industrious habits; to reform those who, oftenders once, would be always offenders, if they were not lifted up by the hand of the benevolent, and who, if the pressnt movement were successfuUy opposed, would be deprived of all chance of being restoredato society, or of being worthy of it. (Hear, hear.)
Depaty DAKIN saidbhe had paid particular attention to the question, and he believed that the re'ormatories were doing a grealamount of good. (Hear, bear.) After all that had been done and might be done for the preventionof crime, unfortunately crime stiUl existed and would exist, and reformation must still form one of the great elements of philanthropy, and when the institutions were well conducted they could not but be the ornaments of society. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR spoke in favour of the report. The question had, he said, been taken up by Parliamont and by some of the ablest men of the day, and the city of London ought not to be excluded from the advantages which would no doubt be derived from participation in the measure,
MIr. WOOLTORTON strongly approved the report, and said the committee had investigated the subject with the greatest strictness.
Mr. FRY said that the reformatories were instruments whereby the cure of a most formidable evil might be expected to be performed.
After some observai'ons from Mr. De Jersey in answer to the objectors to the report the Court divided, and there appeared-
For the amendaent ... ... ... ... 45 Against it .. ... ... . ... 52

THE FREEDO31 OF THE CITY TO DR. L MIGSTONE. Mlr. J. E. SAUN.DERS, jun., moved,-
" Tnat the freedom of the city in a box of the value of 50 guineas b 3 presented to the Rer. David Lisingatone, LLJD.,as a thstinronial in recognition of hia zealous and persevering exertions In the important discoveries he baa made in Africa, by which geographical, geological, and kindred sdences have been advanced, facta arcertained that may extend the trade andcomnmerceof thisnoonntry, and berefter secrue to the native tribes of the vast Africancontinent the blesings of knowledge and civilization."
Alderman ROSE seconded the motion, which was agreed to unanimously.
Mfr. GREsILum moved,-
" That all future sittings of the Court shall be open to the public. unless the majority of the members present shail otherwise determine."
A long discussion took place upon the question, and several amendments (all of which were negatived) were proposed. The motion was ultimately agreed to in its original form.

The directors of this company have just i;ssed their report. It states that the c'pital expended to the 31st of DLecember last amounted to 11227,108JI The cash and securities in thelhands of the compazy amoanted to 246,1727, making the total amount raised on shares and by loans on mortgage ll,473,280! There remins of capital to be called np in respect of the last issued o per cent. preference stock redeemable at 5 per cent. preminm 40 per cent., being 400,000L The gross earnings for the half year have been correspodbeingganincreareof 21,481L above those of the eo period of 155. The ,gross expenditure of the half-yeMar has been 303,35.-5',, or less by 2,7241' than for the same period of 185;-,, leaving * balance of 344,976L., being an increase of 24,205L over that of the corresponding peniod oE 1855. To that sum is added 155!. from last c. count, and 8,4007L for rent of Royston and Hitchin, makinm a total of 3535,35. From this is deducted 109,611! fixed charges, rents, and interest on debt, being an increase of 6,36i,L, and leaving 243,925!. This would have enabled the directors under ordinary circumstances to propose a dividend which, added to that declared in August last, would make the whole years dividend amount to 6 per cent. upon the whole of the legal stock of the company. A table shows that the traffic amounted in the year 1853 to 868,S991 ; in 1854, to 1,050,0717- ; in 1865, to 1,137,612L; and in 1856, to 1,218,177I.: showing an increase in four years of 349,278L, or 4019 per cent. The award of Mr. Gladstone in respect to the division of traffic to and from places common to the Great Northern on the one part, and those of the London and North-We5tern, the Midland, and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire on the other part, ray be daily expectd. An agreement has been entered into with the promoters of the Doncaster and Wakefield Railway for working the traffic, which line will afford a direct route from Doncaster to Leeds, The directors recommend the proprietors to subscribe 160,0001. towards the cost of constracting the line between Castle Douglas and Portpatrick. The report gives an account of the retration office, the introduction and appointment of Leopold Redpath thereto, and the principal duties of the registrar. Mr. Clark had been appomnted registrar in Jnly, 1846, at 6004 a-year, and left the service of thu company in the spinrg of 1854 during which time Redpath was chef slerk, andhavingcondrctedhimself apparentlywithregularity and propriety,he appearedtottheboard tobessaitableperson to succeed 3r. Clark, and he was therefore promoted to be
gstrar, at asalaryof 250L per annum, in March,1854 About .be tme of hisap'ointmentas registrar itwas reportedto the directors that Rapeath was a person of good circumstances, realized by successful dealings in reversionaryand other speculative securities, but that, satisfied with his success, he bad ceased to speculate, The directors having exacted a T.romise from him that he would strictly abstain from speculatg in shares or stock of any description, he was appointed registrar. InJanuay, 1856, the secretary communicated to the chairman that he had been informed there was a discrepancy between the stock registered and the money repre>ented to have heen received on account of the same in the iccotints books, and that he had consequently caUled upon the registrar and the accountant for a statement of the amountsof stock and dividends appearing in their respective books. On the c7thandl8thof Octoberthesecretaryproduced to the chairman returns which he had required the registr to furnih, and which showed that stock to the amount of about 137,0001. was registered in excess in the hooks of the company. A statement of the dividends paid, obtained from I the accountant, confirmed this alarming communication. It I appears that in several years during which Mr. Clark was
Iregistrar a large numberof forgeries were committed bylRedpath, which were not discovered til the end of 185/. The directors remark that if Mr. Clark had regularly examined the transfers of .stock and the registration books so as to produce at the end of each half-year a really accurate " register of shareholders," there could be no doubt that the greater part if not the whole of Redpath's forgeries would have been prevented or disoovered long ago. It appears that 3fr. Clark on retiring from the service of the company received 8751. as compensation.
Clnetter to the directors has fully and comp]etely repliedto their allegations, and clealy shoswn from the constition of the registration-office and the want of sufficient assistance that no blame whatever attached to him; amd that before his retirement he had instituted an ivestigation that would have discovered those discrepancies or frauds, if he had been allowed to complete it. From a list of ,urchases nd sles effected by Messrs. Field, Son, and Wood, stockbrokers, of Warnford-court, for Redpath, it appears that about June, 1848, they sold for him the first eight shares fraudulently dealt with. James Wood, their clerk, was the attesting witness to Redpath's sigrature on the transfer deed. The list extends from June, 1848, to October, 186, and embraces 365 distinct sales of Great Northern stock, to the amount of 206,0471. 10s., and 131 purchases, amounting to 4A,S004 The result of the meet careful examination of the company's "register of stocks," &c., which time and circumstances have permitted since the discovery, in November last, of these transactions shows that stock to the amount of about 220,0004 has teen fraudulently issued by Redpath. From the opinion of eminent counsel it appears that a dividend cannot be legally or safely paid at present upon any description of stock, or until provision be made for purchasing up and extinguishing stock equal in amount to the stock so franudulently created and issued. They think, however, that much controversy and expense would be avoided if the holders of stock would agree to apply to ParI liament for a Bill to legalize the stock as now existing, and
the payments of dividends thereon, and in the meantime authorize the directors to pay dividends on all the stock.
Some of the holders of A stock, it seems, intend to oppose the proposed measure.
NORTH LONDON AND SOUTH-EASTERN
JTUNCTION.
At the annual meeting of the Thames Tunnel Company held on Tuesday at Radiey's Hotel, it was stated that the receipts for the past year amounted to 5,6741., and, after defraying expenses and paying the Government 1,1411., therc remained a balance of 595l.
Mr. AtrsnN proposed that the original shareholders should subscribe a certain sum towards forming a line of railway from the South-Eastern Railway through one side of the tannel to the North London and London and NorthWestern Railways, and thought it probable that those companies would guarantee them a certain dividend for the outlay and use of one side of the tunnel, the other side being retained for foot passengers. They should first make an arrangement with the Government on the subject of their claim on the company. The total cost of the tunnel to 1843 was 4.54,7141., and the amount paid to the Government 28,326!.
LEOMISTER AND KINGTON.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Leominster on Tesday, Lord Bateman in the chair.
The report stated that the contractors had engaged to open the line throughout for public traffic in Ma1y next. The capital account showred that 71,7684. had been received and 71,25!. expended, leaving a halance of 5184
On the motion of die chairman the report was adopted, and the meeting separated.
CARLISLE AND SILLOTH BAY.
The report of the directors of this company states that the railwvay has nowv been in operation for four months. The stations at Kirkbride and Abbey Holme are not yet completed. Although thc local traffic is not developed, the receipts have more than covered the workig expenses. The results have nevertheless been must encouraging. Thejetty and dock-works are progressing very satisfactorily. Arrangements are now being made for enabling steamers, colliers, and other veesels to load and discharge at the jetty until the dock is completed. The report of Mr. Abernethy, the engineer, states that the jetty has been carred out to a distance of 730 feet, leaving only 270 feet to complete the whole length of 1L000 feet. The permanent way is laid to within 50 yards of the end of the jetty from the Silloth station, and he is confident that the whole will be ready for traffic inthemonth of ApriL The capital account to the 31st of December showed that 101,0334 haid been received, and 101,12U. expended, leaving a balance of 68!. due to revenue. The revenue account from the 3d of September to the 31st of December amounted to 5221. and the expenses to 4541,, leaving a balance of 68!
RAILWAY PASSENGERS' ASSURANCE.
The report of the directors ofthiscompanystatesthat the income during the past half-year, received and due, is 6,024, being 3,1761. on account of railway accidents, and 2,8471. on account of general accidents. The total income icr the year 1856 amounted to 12,001L., against 8,7821. in
J855. The expenditure during the past half-year, including :,4951. for compensation, amounts to 7,604!, leaving a balance of 2,2274, which, with the amount due from the clearing-house and agents, makes 2,891!, out of which the directors propose the payment of interest at 4 per cent., free of income-tax. The accoxse for the half-year show 3S case of compensation paid for rilway accidents, including one of 2504; and 79 cases of ganeral accidents, including two fatal cases of 1.000!. each. It appears the total amount paid as compensation for 26 .fatsl accidents and 595 cases of p l from the COEnencement to December,

The magnificent trio by Beethoven was the " feature" of the evening, although Haydn's fresh and genial quartet, f*rom which Boetboven and Weber did not disdain to gther some augestionu, and the brilliant composition of Spohr. wherein the first fiddle has the lion's share, wero both decidedly welcome. Bnt the trio introduced a new $anistlIerr Derffel, fromn Vienna1 about whom grout things wver
expected;,more especially since, in his* Analytical Programme," Mr. EUa, tbe director, hasiSntroduced himu to thc audience in the following terms:

That Herr Derffel (who, we understand, has " settled " at Brgbton) did Dot exnctly come up to what the above advertisement led many to anticipate was perhaps as much tbo fault of the Princess Crartoryska as of the diroectors of the Musical Union. The now pianist's reading and execution of Beethoven's trio were such as entitled him to a very respeotable plce, and nothing more, among tho hosts of German pianists, from Hamburg to Vienna, and fronm Augsburg to Lubecl;, who, to escape the lot which in all probability awaits them in their own country-that of being mingled with the common herd-cone bravely to England, under the settled conviction that, in foggy and unmu ical London, their genius, if not precisely understood (how can thal be espectod ), will be tacitly acknowlededd and inifloently rewatded_ How many of these are crneUy disappointed itis hardly necessary to add. We greatly fear that Herr Derfel will have to do in England what countless precursors have dono before him-viz mingle with that common herd which ho would fain have avoidod in " Fatherland." We have heard the trio in D played just as weU by pianist after pianist at the concerts of the Society
t Britigh dMusicians and elsewhere Mozart's GI - which, Mr. Ella tells us, is "not much known in this country," but which, nevertheless, is very well knownwas played much in the same average manner as tho trio. The FPantaia Jlfdodkowc (why Fantassia-or why Melodiqtuc I Herr Derffel's own composition, was also his most finisbeu performanco. Ne'ither this, however, nor the trio made much impression.
The two quartets wvero splendidly executed by lL Sainton. e of the Tery best quartet playors noiw before the public), Z.r Blagrove, Herr Coffril and Signor Piatti-curious enough, a Frenchman, an nglishman, a German, and an Italian. The beautiful pert-song of IlendeLhoohn, And the somniferous Gmrlied, married to some music by Graun (author oF the forgotten oratorio of ed S.Tcsz, the forgotten opera of Britannicuc, and a whole library of other compositions, equally forgotten), were tolerably, and only tolerably, sung by a small choir, under the direction of tr. Land, who should strive to instil into his disciples a more precise ideas of intonation.
Mr. Henry Leslie's Choir.
MR. HEZNRY LSLrE`S CHOIR.
The choristers vho under the diligont training of Mr. Henry Leslie, have already, though so recently organized il a body, attained a cexain position before the public, are
.ving a series of concerts in tho Hanover-square Rooms. T{hesecondtook placelsatniglit, inpresenco of a very numerous sudience. The programme consisted, as mayb supp , chiefly of madrigals and part songs, tho greater part of which wero admirably sung. Threo pieces in the first art were encored-the "Serenado oftheStudent7" from Mr.Benedict's opera of The Gipsy's Warning, Mr H. Leslie's "Boat Song," and Pearsall's madrigal "I saw lovely Phillis "-all of which (the screnade by _r. Benedict especially are, more or leIs, works of merit. Mr. Leslie's setting of Walter Scott's famou6 lyric ("-Hail to tho Chief") has, novcrtheless, inissed the character and sentiment suggested by the poom. It is diffcult to understand how a musician of taste and discernment could hLve disregarded the plain signification of such words as these -
"While everyUighluad glen, "Sonds our shout back againt
IRoderich Vich Mpphi dhu, ho ieroo!"
Or have wedded to a sort of Kucke-nish tablo-song so magnificent a verse as the following:
Our Is no rapUing chanro sown by the fountain.
I. Blooming at Boltane, in winter to fade;
When tbo whirlwind has trpp'd erery leaf on tho mountain. Thoe ncoro rall Cn Alpine exalt in her shad-
aiooed in the rifled rock,
P< r oofto the tcupcllts shock
rinnev he roots hlm, the ruder be blowx
Mornteith and i albans then hch his pr. raie apain -
eodeich Vach Alpine dli. hio leroe PI
"Hail to the Chief" is a burst of clannish exultation - and if itis too much to ask the composer who sets it ti
music for some delicate allusion to the Scottish style of maelody, we have at least the rhurt to insist upon a glinpsc of the heroic. It is this recklessness about the sense oE pootry which too often brings musicians into disrepute and exposes them to the just condemnation of non-musical critics.
A much less successful effort of the choir than any of the above-mentioned was the ingenious and beautiful madrigal "Sweet honey-sucking bees "-Wilbye's best, and perhaps the finest ever composed by an Englshman. True this is far more difficnlt than the simple effusion of Pearsall, or the simpler one of 3lr. Leslie. But that is the very reson whygrter pains should havo been taken. Unsteady in manz placs, and out of tLne in moreo this noble madn. gal-which it should be the pride of choral wbieties to master-by no means satisfied connoisseum. To xcquire a oortain reputation by the perfect execution of bagtelles is not very dillicult ; but to obtain the approval of judges by an equally perfect execution of the moro profound and difficult works of great masters, though indispensable to sold fame, demands a greater amount of labour and perseverance. We believe that Mr. Leslie and his choir are as capable of one as of the other. Let them, then, establish tho fact. Mr. S. W_ Waley's charming song, " Sing on, sing on, ye little birds ," given with great feeling by Maadam5eWeiss and accompanied on the pianoforte by the composer, with tbe additional advantage of Mr. Alfred PoDlockk's assistance in tho oboe obbtigato, afforded unanimous gratification, Another pleasing contrast to tla choral performances was Beethoven'g well-knowvn andantc in F, for the pianoforte, which was plaveto perfection byM3dlle. Angelina Levy, and auplauded witlienthusiasm. This andante ormally formen part of the grand sonata in C major, but being found too long for its position in that work was withdrawn by the great Comoposer, who sabstituted a shorter movement, and published the andante separately. It is a mnost interesiing pieee qucandZ mt2mc, and delightful to hear when so thoroughly understood and executed with audli refinement and sensibility as. by Mdlle. Angelina on the present occasion. The first part of the concert ended verr effectively vith Mendelssohn's imnressive arrangement of the 65th Psalm for soprano, organ. and chorns. Thc chief vocal part (a great favourite with Jenny Lind, whose singing in the concluding Pa
": Oh I for the wings of a dove"n_at Exeter-hall, t season, can hardly hav, been forgotten) was rendered,with fervour by Madame Weiss, and the organ accompanli nt carefully played by Mr. John Foster i but tho cnscntl± left much to. be desired. Mr. }Renry Leslhe conducted.
