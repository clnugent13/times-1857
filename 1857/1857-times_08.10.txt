M ONE Y-MA RAETand CITYINTELIJG.NCR Saturday Evening. The English funds have been dull to-day, and, after having opened at a decline of an eighth, they experienced a further slight reduction. ConBols fog money were first quoted 90i to i and 90J- to J for the9th of September, at which they remained with. ollt much variation until after regular hours, whexr there were sellers for the account at 90i. The un- favourable character of the Bank return, and theL announcement that the representatives of Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia have joined the French Minister in the demonstration which he has thought fit to make at this moment against the Porte, contributed to the feeling of dallness. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 210j; Reduced, 90i to ; NewThree per Cents., 90g to 91; India Stock, 213 to 215; Indi Bonds, 23d. to 1&. discount; and Exchequer. bills, 4s. discount to par. In the discount-market to-day there was an increased demand. The transactions in foreign stocks have beem limited. Turkish experienced a further decine of nearly J per cent. Granada were neg-otiated at 22; ditto deferred, 5 ; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 03 ; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 993, - for money, and 99, -Q- for the account; Venezuela, 32j; and the deferred, 12k. The final quotations on the Paris Bourse this. evening were 66f. 95c. for money, and 67f. 10c. for the end of the month, showiDg no alteration. About 140,0001. of Australian gold was sold to the Bank to-day. Many people are pondering vrhether Russian agency has been at wrork in India. A more practical question would be whether it is at work In England. Of course, Russia is acting according to her nature and opportunities from the Caspinn to Calcutta. But the evil being notorious loses ite terrors. We do our best to meet it in a vigorou. and honest way, and leave the result to Providence. Our real dangers arise from involultary agents of. Russia at home. If that Power wishe6 to work usharm in the East, what kind of missionaries will she most value,-those who would pursue the vulgarmethod of sowing discontent among the soldiery and people, or thoso who would contrive, without our consciousness and without the possibility of implicating her in the movement, to delay all out communications with that region, to prevent isa from cultivating friendships with neighbouring races, and to check the development of a trade that might threaten to compete vith her own and partly to extinguish it ? If the latter would be her choice, she has apparently no need to seek them. Among our own wordy formalists she will find them. to her hand. If there be a possibility of shortening, our distance to India by one-half there will be nooccasion, if legislative aid is required for the task, to set intrigues on foot to retard its accomplishment. No matter if the help demanded be but, nominal, or, at most, only such as under every conceivable contingency could not involve the outlay we gladly incur in panic for a few steam-transports, the affair will be shunned' or postponed until those who have endeavoured to promote it are worn out, or the favourable circumstances that invited it have pas3ed away. There is hardly a subject on which the people of England are at this moment more alive than that of the Euphrates route to the Persian Gulf. The saving of a thousand miles in out transit to India, the strengthening of the Turkish empire, the influence of a new trade with Persia, and the restoration of civilization and prosperity to the land distinguished as the cradle of the human race, all impel them to the undertaking. In this, however, there is a sort of enthusiasm, and enthusiasm, although it used to be the foundation of the greatness of nations, is incon. sistent with a regard to routine, precedent, and, in short, all the ordinary elements of modern Parliamentary life. On several occasions an attempt haq been made to bring the subject under consideration, but the abridgment of the distance from 28 days to 14 between ourselves and 200,000,000 of souls whom we have undertaklen to rule is not a matter to take precedence of the common pedantries of the hour. The niaht before last the wants of New Zealand- which is perhaps the last place in the world the public are thinking about at the preeent moment-hadl to be discussed and provided for, and yesterdayevening was partly devoted to tne chimneypota on Somerset-house, the size of the rooms at St. James's Palace, and a variety of other topics of equal importance, whein the pulse of the country is throbbing for every nerve to be strained to repair past infatuation iz neglecting the most obvious methods for consolidating our Eastern empire. Meanwhile, the Euphrates question is postponed until the first favourable opportunity. U7pon the 8th of August, wihen there are doubtless a multitude of other chimney-pot or equally elevated domestic mattere remaining to be cleared off, the value of such anz announcement is certain to be appreciated, if not in London at all events at St. Petersburg. The violent fall in Great Western Railway shaTes has been the chief subject of attention to-day. Since the 1st of January the decline in the stock has been 20 per cent.-namely, from , 0 to 56. It is to be hoped a committee of investigation wvill be appointed forthwith. Nothing has happened since the commencement of the year beyond what the directori had the power of foreseeing, and it is for them to reconcile the statements then made and the subsequent result. The pressure in the moneyZ market and the onerous terms to whica the company have consequently been obliged to submit in connexion with their floating debt will doubtless be urged among the causes of their altered position; but this -would be fallacious, as the interval, at all events, has not been one of augmented pressure. Instead of sacrificing their shares in wild alarm, the holders had better institute a thorough scrutiny, and it will be against the experience gained in a majority of similar cases if they do not find that, with good management, the property has still the elements of a sture, although perhaps slow, recovery. The Paris correspondent of the Econion ist statess some new facts in relation to M. Charles Thurneysmen, whose failure and flight tool place in Mlay last, and who has been thus far screened from capture. It appears that his debts amuount to G40,0001., which is close UpoIn the estimate originally given by The Tbinrs, and pronounced by the partisans of the Cr6dit Mobilier to be a gross ex. aggeration, while his assets at the best will not exceed 60,0001. For ten years he had been insolvent, and for seven he had been regularly plundering hie clients. The creditors are endeavouring to bring two of his relatives-M. Auguste Thurneyssen, the well-known banker, and M. George Thurneyssenunder liability as partners, owing to mutual transactions entered into at various periods, and the Tribunal of Commerce has postponed its decision for a fortnight. The following is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At the meeting of the London and South-Western the dividend declared was at the rate of 40 per cent. against o per cent. for the corresponding period last year. The diminution is attributed to the fact of the receipts in 1So6 being largely increased by the exceptional circunstances of the naval review and the transmiission of troops consequeintupon the close of the war. At the same time the working expenses have been larger. A gradual provision of a sufficient working stockis in' progress, and 20,S6NI. has been expended on that account and charged against capital; additions have also been made at the cost of revenue. The relaying and renewal of the line aro proceeding where necessary, and the permanent way is in good order. 1,500 shares in the proposed Wiiubledon and Epsomi Railwav have bcen taken ip by the company. The capital account ShOwS 9,413,&521. expended against 9,293,3531. reeeived. The report of the Stockport, Disley, and ll halybridge states that the line as far -as Whaley Iwas opend for public traffic on the 9th of June, and that tbe result, as regards passeigers, has proved very satisfactory. A Bi to extend the railway to Buxton is now passing through Parliament. A large accessi-n of profit is anticipated from this ex- tension. At a meeting of the East Suffolk the terms of agreement proposed by the Eastern Counties for the conduct of the traffic from Lowestoft and Yarmouth to various distriets of their line were approved. This arranDgement is to continue for 21 years, and does not prejudice in any way the pr ,visional agreements entered into with Sir M. Peto. The Geelong anid Mlelboturne line is completed through to Williatnstown, a distance of 40 miles, and was to be formally inaugurated in the month of June last. An agreement has been made with Mr. J. R. Davison to construct the Oswestry and New- town Railway, and the first sod was turned on the 4th inst. The contract for the construction of the Ceylon Railway was finally accepted by the home Government on the 6th of July last) and maeaures

THE CORN TRADB. LIVERPOOL Airn, st R. The weather to-fdy hat improved; no rain, but a dull, heavy atmosphere. The prices are much the game as Yesterday, with much finnaese On the part of holders. NOTTINGHA.M, Aulnusr S. Until Thursday the weather was fine for harveet work, and sonalder able progrese wvasmade. Since Ihen tbe weatherhnhbeen verystormy and harvest operations have been impedfd. From all Partb there arm the moat eatisfactory acconte respecting the wheat crop. Around Farr dield a large breadth of ooan haa been mat, and some wheat led the quality and yield being excellent in the neIghbourhood of Waleeby and Boughton, wheat is a good crop. At Walesby oats were hb used more than a week since. and but for the etormy weather this week the harvest would soon have been complelted. Barley in hardly togoad icrop ua last year. Around Laxton wheat cutting commenced on Mfoaday. and the yield wIll be a good one. Beans In this district are light. In the neighbourhood of Epperstone the wheat crOpS are good. Upon tbe whole., there is no doubt that the yield of wheat in this county vil be a good one; the only thing now vwanted is fine weather to conclude the harvest. Barley In moet districts wtl prove au inferor crop. Beans are variable. Oats are ahort. Turnips are lookang letter, as aleo is mangold. Potatoes are looking well The earlyb rt3 at our market ae cheap and of good quality. The grass lands have een greatly berefited by the rains. The cattle traLde i sluggish, at reduced raise At Nottingham there was a large supply of beaats, the demand for which wae very inani. mate, and many had to be driven away unsold.

At this cors-exchange to-day there was a tolerable show of wheait with a limited attendance of farmers, who are now pretty generauy enxs gad in the harvest. Wheat made 2a more money than ulat week, fuin wheat ealling at 7le, and red at Me. per quarter. In barley there wea not much dolag, grinding sorts being quoted at 3Sj.

A large breadth ot corn has beon out this week, the weather until ThursdaY being highly favourable for that Purpose. Wheat promises remarkab:y well. In Castle Donington dintriet (where there is soen of the beat land In the country) the wheat crops are very good, with a fineear, the quality of the grain being of a finst-rate description In Belvoir-valo, also, the wheat crops are exceedingly well spoken of, and, aelbcueh in some cases appear thinner than we have seen them in same former years yet their line, well-filed ears indicate a gaod yield, Around Market Harboreugh and other districts there are the same flattering accountn respecting wheat, and now a con. tinuanoe of fine wea-her is only required to bring the harvet to a eatlfactcery ooncluslon. Barley varies considerably, but % gaood crop cannot be expected, as in many districts the Yield wil be deficient. Fat stock is seling at lewa prices. At Leiceeter, with a large ho(w of beasts, the trade ruled heavy, beef selling at a reduction of id. per lb. Sheep were la good supply, fine qualities making 7d, per lb.

A good deel of rain has fallen since Wednesday, and harvest work baa been irterrupted. A largo breadth of corn has been cut, and reDorte of the wheat crop are very Batistactory. Some, however, has been laid by the heavy raine of Thureday and Friday. If the weather would now become settled, the wet would be rather productive of good than banrm It Is seldom that the wbeat ears are so floe as they are this year, and from all distriits accounts agree that there will be an excellent Yield. Barley, although conslderably Improved, will, it in fea-ed, not coma up to an average: neIther wi 1 oato Turalpa are In proving. and potatoea look exceedingly welL The rain has freshened up the pastlres, which were beginning to look vely bare.

The weather during the latter part of the week has been wet. A good breadth of core has been cleared in the most beautiful condition. As respects wheat there in now no doubt of the goodness of the crop. The plant is not so thick upon the ground as in come previous years' but the ears are very fine and well filled, and the quality of the train excellent. In most diatricts the wheat crope ar highly tstr- nsnd upon all well-farmed land tbe yield will be very good, Barley i5a variable crop, and, taken altogether, Will in all probability prove de1 ficient; the quality, however, to exceedingly fine. (ate are also hardly an average. The sbowers in the middie of the week have been highly favoiurable to mangold and turnips. Potatoes look well, and bld fair to give a good yield. The cattle trade is less active. At Peterborough beasts were in hmited aupply, and beef made 7a 3d. to 8s. Der atone.

The weather was fine until the middle of the week, when there was snme hea y rain. From nearly all distrlctsreports respecting the wheet crop are Patisfactory. In the nelghbeumhood of Spalding a good breadth of eorn is cut, and wheat is exceedingly well spoken of. Around Lynn harvret weor is almost general, and the wheat crops are good. In the wo:ds there have been some sllght complaints of nildew. Wheat cuttne is iwell commenced, the earsare vwellfilled, and the grainbids fair to be of good quiality. In the nel_hbourhood of Ulceby the hot weather having ripened the crops at the early pfart of the week the scithe was in full operation. The oulk of wheat is less, but the ears In thb district are unuaually large and well filled, and wil yIlsd weL Barleyts deficient. Around Lincoin the harveetwas infull operatlonuntiUtbe rain came. The wheat crops in thatnelghbourhood areremarkably good, and ilth favourable weather the harvestwill soon he concluded. In the dIctrictwaround Spilsby wheat promi6sesan abundant yield. At Alfored the wheat crops are well spoken of, and wiU yield a good average. Spring corn is looking thin, and wIll be a short crop. At some of the local markets samples of new wheat have been offered at very high rates; the samples are exceedingly fine. In moet districts barley in indif. ferently spoken of, and there now appears to be no doubt as to the deficiency of the yield. Beans wil also be a short yield, the inteuse heat of the sun having been unlavourable to the bloom. Peas indicate about an average. TsrniDs and mangold have been greatly Improved by the rain. Oats are a very bad crop. Potatoes are looking healthy, and there aro very few complaints ot disease. Fat stoCk Is dlecDliing in price.

Tuesday last was the hottest day on record, sineo which copious rains have falen, which have well satursteol the soiL }Harvest operations may now be said to be nearly conmpleted, iand from the reports from the various dietriots there is little duibt that the crop of al kinds of cereals is neurly doub:e the tiesnal average. Both wheat and barley are full eared, and the grain heavy. C4ts bave also faaen in first-rate condition. Owing to the protracted dry weather swedes seMl not yield anything approach. ing a crop, ac,d there is every prospect that keep for cattle will be dear duriig the next winter. At present thero are few c'mplalnts of any dlsease atmong the potatoes, but in some of the eitelicts that pest gives unmiatakeable signs of its ravages having oommcenced. Turnips. hoNvever, appear to be suffering from disease. l1oDs have experlenced Eome slight improvement rosm the late rains, which have had the effect of washing off the vermin and freeing the blnaeom-bearing ahoote.

STATE OF TBADE. MAN%CHESTER, AUG. 8. The market this morning haa not been active. A moderate demand was experienced for some kinds af domestioc, long-cloths, and shirtings suitable both ior home consump. tion and for export, but there was little or nothing done in fabrics made for India. The aggregate business of the entire week has not been considerable, but the large sales recently made out of stock, with orders taken for future supply, have left manufacturers in a comparatively easy position, and there is very little pressure on the market for sales, so that prices are quite steady. Mfanufacturers are in a better position than they were a month ago, but such of them as have to buy yarn still complain of an nremunerative trade. Spinners are in a better position, and there are soms heavy contracts running for yarns, and partieordrly for doubled yarns from 40's to 120's. The iron trade of the district continues steady, bnt the American orders are not so numerous as were anticipated. The general ironfoundry trades aredoing an average amount of work, and some of the largest establishments are busily employed upon heavy contracts. The nail trade at Dadley and the neighbourhood is active, but the demand is chiefly for exportation. The general brassfoundry businesses of the town are improving. Now prices are steady, without any immediate prospect of an alteration, orders are coming in more freely. The merchants state that the demands for copper are upon the increase, and that last quotations are extremely firm. At Wolverhampton the manufacturers complain that the last advances in the prices of tin have produced an injurious effect upon the trade, but, notwithstanding, the chief establishments of the district are pretty fairly employed. The military gun trade remains remarkably brisk. The contractors are making every exertion to meet the demands of the Board of Ordnance, and in this they are energetically supported by the operative gunmakers. The annual report of the Eidland Banking Company, just issued, is highly satisfactory. It appears that the last year's profits, after paying the year's incorme-tax and providing for every bad and doubtful debt, amounted to 30,9091. 3s. 6d.; and that afterthe payment of the usual half-yearly divideaid a balance of 8,7321. 4s. 8d. will be carried to the guarantee fund. The paid-up capital now amounts to 150, 0001, A dividend of 4 per share was deCared, payable on the 1st of September, making adivdendfor the year of 71. 10s., or 15 per cent. upon the capital of the hank. The directors state that they hope to be able at the next annual meeting to propose a scheme for the rateable distribution of shares gratuitously among the then existing proprietors, without redtucing the present rate of dividend or materially lessening the guarantee fund, which they think should not be less than 100,0001. The report of the Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bankidg Company, just published, recommends a dividend of l0s. and bonus of 2s. 6id. per share for the past half-year, making (with the dividend of 7s. 6d. paid last half-year) 20s. per share upon the year. It is proposed to appropriate a surplus of 15,0001. to the augmentation of the guarantee fund, which will then stand at ;10,000l. NOTTINGHAM, AUG. 8. The lace trade is in a quiet state, a full average bnsiness being, however, doing; the present time i5 usuallyadull period. There is some inquiry for w6ide laces of good quality, but few buyers have visited the warehouses this week, and the demand for most descriptions of lace is very quiet. Material, however, continues at an extraordinary price, and the opinion prevails that it will remain so for some time. The hosiery trade is extremely dull, and, indeed, has been so for some timepast. Manufacturersareprudentlyabstaining from increasing their stocks. Hosiery, silk, and yarns are stiU very high. At the annual meeting of the Nottingham and Notts Banking Company the report of the airectors stated that the businass of the company had increased this year to the extent of 20 per cent. It was recommended that the dividend be increased from 4i to 5 per cent. and adopted. LEICESTER, ArG. S. There is a decided improvement in the hosiery trade. For fancy goods there is an increasing demand, and the trade generally is more animated. Many framework-knitters are also engaged in the harvest field. The wool-market is firm, good farmers' lots realizing 44s. per tod. The worsted mills are now in full work. There is verv little alteration to report in the state of trade at Hiuckley or Lough. borough. b uNORWICH, ArG. S. The monthly circular of the London, Norwich, and Northampton Boot and Shoe Company states that the shoe trade in Norwich is still good, wvith prospects of increase. The city authorities are now using great efforts to make up the deficiency of workmen by directing the attention of al unemployed hands to the manufacture of shoes, as the demiand for labour at present profitably absorbs all that can be brought to the place. The boot and shoe trade generally is in a more active state than it has been for some time previously. The demand for hoiiie consumption, which has materially increased, is still increasing; aiid the colonial trade continues at present as prosperous as before. B1RADFORD, AUG. S. The worsted staff trade remains without alteration. There is a moderately active demand for pieces, and rather letter prices are in the majority of cases obtained by the manufacturers, wbo, however, complain (and not wvithout reason) that the advance does not keep pace with the augmented cost of production. The firmnness of their pretensions is enhanced by the lowness of stocks at present in our warehouses, and wlhere their demands are not acceded to by nerchants they prefer temporarily to limit their production; in the aggregate, bowever, there bas been given out a satisfactory nutmber of orders. In the warehouses during the week we have had a tolerable attendance of buyers, and a fair trade for the season is reported. The yarn branch is in a healthy condition. New contracts for worsted yarns are given out with considerable frecdom, and are accepted by spinners at an advance, so that eniploymeut, which is now good in this department, will, to all appearances, continne to be so for at least the remainder of the month. Cotton y arns find a fair demand, but the prices have an upward tendency, and the actual amount of business transacted is reported as rather quiet. The state * f the wool-market 'is without miaterial change what little there is to be noted is for the better. Combing vwools again experience a sati,factory inquiry, after the te-ms porary dulness of last weel, and fornmer rates are firmly umaintained for most descriptions, whlle in the prices of best long-stapled quaHties a slight improvemnent is obeervable. Clothiug wools also command somewhat enhanced prices, and the demand foo all short descripiions is steadily continued. DtIBLIIN, Avc. S.

LONDON, MONDAY, A UCUST 10, 1857. It would be strange indeed if the blunders of subordinate diplomacy should endanger the results which were achieved by the profuse expenditure of the blood and treasuro of France and Eng(land in the East. How many persons in either country are aware of the real merits of the present dispute concerniig the Moldo-Nallachian Pro. vinces ? Neither of the two great Powers Tw'hicli, by a union of their force, carried the great contest in the Crimea to so suecessful an issue can have any direct interest in the matter. 'We are too far removed from the scene of action to be immediately affected by the settlement, whatever it may be. WVith Austria, with Russia, with Turkey it is otherwise. Any arrangemeint which would bring their dangerous neighbours nearer to the Auistrian Provinces would naturaUy be distasteful to the Government of that country. Now, in the opinion of Austrian statesmen, a unioin of the two provinces under a single Prince, or puppet, would be suchl an arrangement. They therefore say, " We will have none of it." Again, the advisers of the SuLTrx look wvith an evil eye upon any solution which would endanger the integrity of the SUlTAN's dominions. Such a solution they consider the union of the Principalities to be. If it were carried, they foresee as the consequence one of two things-either that Moldo-Wallachia will become another Egypt, or, still more probably, that the province will become the seat of intrigues, carefully fostered by iRussian diplomacy, the inevitable result of which will be its subjection, at no distant date, to the rule of the Russian CzAR. The Russian Cabinet, on the other hand, is very naturally also endeavouring to regain by astuteness what it has failed by violence to attain. If the union of the provinces be decreed they see clearly enough that Sebastopol is all but avenged. The Western Powers are welcome to the barren glory-the fruit will be for more practical men. U'nder these circumstances it is that the visit ef the Emperor Loris NAPOLEON to the English QUEEN at Osborne has taken place. We notice the event with the greatest satisfaction, because we perceive in it not only a manifestation of good will generally, but, more than this, the earnest of a determination to arrive at some rational settlement of a business which, obscure enough to begin -with, has been rendered doubly so by the mistaken zeal of our diplomatists. France and England, we repeat it, can have no selfish interests in the matter. We desire to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman empire, as far as this can be done, in the Cabinet as we have maintained it in the field. There our action stops. The ultimate solution must be left to time, and to the influence of increasing traffic and civilization. Now, there can be no question as to the wirhes of the SULTAN and his advisers upon the subject. If they be forced into a reluctant acquiescence in the union of the provinces, they acquiesce under fear of the consequences. Is this a possible or a decent result of the gigantic exertions recently made by the Wcstern Powers in support of the SuLTAN'S authority ? The imbroglio which exists at the present moment is to be attributed entirely to the mistaken energy of Constantinopolitan diplomacy, and wvill, no doubt, be speedily unravelled in tho course of a straightforward conference between the leading parties to the late war. In every way the wishes of the Frenclh Government are entitled to the highest respect. It is a fortunate circumstance that the Emperor of the FRENCH shoIIld have taken this negotiation into his own hands, for it will be thus freed from all the difficulties with which the precipitancy or hesitation of inferior men had surrounded it. We cannot doubt that when he perceives that the SULTAN'S advisers look upon a union of these provinces as a practical surrender of them to Russia he will not crown his exertions in behalf of Turkish independence by trampling it under foot. The position of affairs at the present moment is well nigh analogous to that which existed at Yienna wlheii the Emperor NAPOLEON BONAPARTE had been consigned to the Isle of Elba. The allies, but for the hasty return of the impetuous conqueror, would soon have thrown away at the counciltable all the advantages which they had gained by a successful war.
Tlle blindness of the Indian Govermment to the symptoms of an impending military revolt seems astonishing after the event; but experience shows that great catastrophes occurring for the first time in history are never foreseen. For three quarters of a centtury historians and politicians have been employed in discussing the causes of the French Revolution, but the actors as well as the spectators in that wonderful drama were altogether taken by surprise. All the circumstances which indicated the disaffection of the Bengal Sepoys were carefully observed and considered. The alienation of the soldier from the officer, the isolated acts of insubordination at different stations, the mysterious circulation of cakes throughout Upper India attracted merited notice and comment. The political and military authorities porceived from time to time that there was danger, but they were unable to imagine the form in which it was destined to display itself. It was in vain that warning followed upon warning. No sagacity could anticipate the time, the place, or the manner of the outbreak; and general intimations of danger failed to suggest the urgency of immediate and vigorous measures of precaution. From the time of Sir C. NAInEe's last command in India the unsound constitution of the Bengal Army ought to have been fully understood. Even at an earlier period it is well known that Lord HARDING(E'S confidential communications were utterly inconsistent with the official praises which he thought fit to bestow on the native troops. Five years since General TUCKER, who had been Adjutant-Genieral of the Bengal Army, called attention, in a canvassing letter circulated among the Proprietors of East India stock, to the danger of military disaffection, and to the erroneous measures whichl had been adopted in the lhope of raising the condition of the Sepoy. Lord DAL1OTJSIE in his farewell proclamation declared with truth that the native soldier had nothing to wish for; but pampered and favoured armies have always been most exposed to the temptation of disloyalty. Whatever may be the cause of the wan's of foroeight which has been displayed, it is useless to censure too severely an error which was shared by all the ablest statesmen in India. It must be admitted that the unexpected alarm has been met with unflinching firmness. With one or two doubtful exceptions, every high functionary appears to have been as cool and resoluto as if the revolt of the army had been an ordinary and probable occurrence. The confidence which was placed in some of the native regiments after the commencement of the mutiny was undoubtedly the result of policy rather than of credulity ; but in some instances the affectation of confidence has been carried to the verge of rashness. The troops at Barrackpore were not disarmed till the eve of their meditated outbreak. At an earlior period General HnARSEY'S report of an extensive plot among the soldiery was allowed to pass without any immediate dissolution of the ofieniling regiments. According to the last accounts the GovERNoR-oGENERAL still persisted in dispensing with an European body guard. The result alone will show whether the authorities have been justified in temporizing with troops of doubtrul fidelity. Any part of the army which may have deferred its adhesion to the revolt for threeor four months will probably revert to its allegiance in carnest on the arrival of the English reinforcements. One reason which induced military officers to disregarcl all warnings of futuzre danger consisted in their professional admiration of the external qualities of the Bengal Sepoy. The Brahmins of the Upper Provinces are among the finest races of mankind. It is said that the average height of the men was greater by two inches than that of the English Line, and in many of the secondary qiualities of soldiers their superiority was equally indisputable. Incapable of drunkenness, indisposed to riot, refined in manner, and courteous in deIrmeanour, the high caste Sepoy naturally attracted the good opinion of officers vwho knew him only on parade. A similar exterior would indicate many genuine virtues in the case of a European, but the awkwardest Einglish recruit fresh from the plough would possess iiistincts of honesty and good faith which are utterly unknown to the well-bred Oriental. It is said that the desire of regimental officers to keep up the showy appearance of their regiments has thwarted the prudent determination of the hiiglher authorities to break up the Brahmia monopoly of service. An admlxture of Sikhs in the ranks might have rendered the conspiracy either impossible or innocuous. There is no reason to doubt that the religious pretexts alleged for the mutiny were among the principal causes of disaffection. The proselytizing zeal of some officers and of many English ladies confirmed the suspicions, which were sedulously diffused by the native journals. To minds prepared to take offence any circumstance will furnish one-sided evidence. No other alien Government would have tolerated the existence in its capital of a society for the protection of the indigenous faith against official encroachments; but the Brahminical agitators took care not to remind their dupes that the license with which they spoke disproved their own allegations. The ill-omened cartridges coincided with the Oriental notion of a mechanical and involuntary process of conversion; but the conviction that the soldiery had legitimaate causes of discontent would not of itself have been a sufficient cause of rebellion. The true explanation of a great military revolt is always to be found in its possibility. The missionary efforts of individual officers, and the suspicious grease on the cartridges, would have been endured or explained away if the conspiracy had involved more obvious and imminent risk of failure. If a part of each regiment hadobeen ready to stand by the officers, if the native artillerymen had been selected from a different class of the population, there would probably have been no general attempt at revolt. An English garrison at Delhi would have deprived the malcontents of a rallying-place, and anticipated the necessity of a struggle on which the safety of. the empire depends. The only serious charge against the Indian Government is that of blindness and defective military administration. The complaints of English censors and of foreign maligners are ludicrously inapplicable to the unexpected catastrophe which has occurred. The alleged tyrants of the East are found to have pampered their native troops into disaffection, and they are accused of having given some ground for a suspicion of a desire to propagate Christianity in the East. The insurgent Brahmins have so little faith in their own race and religion that they have been compelled to proclaim the re-establishment of a Mlahomedan dynasty. Their alleged grievances refer chiefly to the laxity of the Government, and to its supposed encouragement of philanthropic projects. Continental politicians will read with astonishment the apologetic speech of the GOVRaNOIGEiEALu in proposing the establishment of a censorship of the press. The policy of the measura may be questioned as far as it relates to the AngloIndian journals, but foreigners will scarcely believe that in a time of civil war there could be any hesitation in suspecting the native organs of sedition. The creation of a vernacular free press in India, and the long suffering with which its abuses have been permitted, are eminently characteristic of the weakness and the strength of the English character, of national confidence in ourselves, and of indifference to the peculiarities of other races. After the termination of the present difficulties it may be presumed that some restraints will be maintained on the native newspapers. Some years will elapse before liberalism again demands that unlimited confidence should be placed in the loyalty of our Eastern subjects. It is, indeed, more probable that popular clamour wil take the opposite direction. Until the fall of Delhi, it is impossible that confidence can be restored in any part of India ; but there is little doubt that the supremacy of the Government will at the latest be re-established before the end of the approaching wold season. The future history of the empire will depend on the judgment which is then exhibited in the reorganization of the native army.
A seat for Birmingham is vacant, and 31r. BRIGHT, the ablest and most vigorous of the candidates at the late General Election who were ousted for their anti-national opinions, is said to have entirely recovered his health and to be quite able to resume the duties of public life. Now, we are no thoroughgoing partisans of Mr. BRIGnT, -on the contrary, we hold that many of hia opinions, if carried out in practice, would render this country the laughing-stock of foreign nations, and reduce us to the level of a secondary Power. Still we think the question may fairly be put to an elector for Birmingham,-" On the whole, is it " possible to secure the services of a better repre"C sentative than Mr. BRIGHT H" He is undoubteely mistaken as to the feelings of the nation upon all matters of peace and war, and, if England were at the present moment involved in hostilities with any great European Power, we could not conscientiously support his pretensions even for the most insignificant constituency in the empire. The case, however, is otherwise. We have this unbappy Indian business upon our hands, but that, no doubt, we shall be able to bring to a satisfactory conclusion, notwithstanding the outcry which any scattered advocates of undiscrimninating massacre, rape, and plunder may be ill-advised enough to raise. Mr. BRIGIIT, moreover, has expressed strongly his opinion in favour of an effectual suppression of the Indian Mutiny. With regard to the Chinese affair, we have heard all that the Peace-at-any-price people have to say. The verdict of the country has been taken upon the issue, and there is an end of that phase of the question. Mr. BRIGHT thought it advisable to make a public profession of his faith upon this Chinese difficulty; we need scarcely add that it was such a profession as emptied many a Parliamentary saddle at the late election. Were he now returned, and were he to give utterance to his peculiar opinions upon t. is subject in the House of Commons, as he most probably would, nobody would take the trouble of reopening the discussion for his accommodation. England will most undoubtedly reorganize her military establishments in India, and place her relations with China upon a secure and satisfactory footing, despite of aU opposition from theorists and speculative politicians. No matter how eloquent may be the voice, howr earnest the convictions, of any gentleman who may wish to drive us into an opposite course, tile plain good sense of the country has decided these two points, and we no longer apprehend the results of any efforts which may be made to reverse the decision. We are, however, just now called upon to deal with other questions--questions of purely domestic policy-and upoII all such points AMr. BRIGOT is entitled to be heard. The great business of next Session will be the Reform Bill. Even upon this matter we can entertain little doubt that we shaU be frequently found in opposition to Mr. BRIGHT. We should, however, deem a Parliament incomplete which had met for the discussion of a new Reform Bill if one of the most eminent-perhaps, as an orator, the most eminent-of our modern Reformers were excluded from the debates. Now we, who at times have been most uncompromising opponents of Mr. BRIGHT, cannot forget-however much his former friends may forget-the great services which he rendered to the country throughout the Pree-trade controversy. Even beyond the range of mere economic questions Mr. BRIGHT has from time to time given evidence of a very considerable grasp of mind upon domestic matters. His great oratorical powers are undeniable, and, on the whole, there are not half a dozen men in the present House of Commons who could so completely command the attention of that assembly as Mr. BBIG}IT has done in times gone past, and as he undoubtedly could again command it, if health and strength be spared him for a renewal of his Parliamentary career. Birmingham should undoubtedly take rank among the most important constituencies of the empire ; but from the force of circumstances, perhaps, as much as froTm any fault of the electors, it has been insufficiently represented. The Birmingham men are still floundering about in the old backwater of 1830. The force of the old Political Unions has long spent itself, but as long as the old prescriptive tenants held their seats there was no opportunity of testing the question. As far as the outer world knew anything of the matter, delusions upon the currency seemed-next to traditions of the most extreme P.adicalism-to be the most acceptable doctrines to the electoral appetite of Binrmingham. The electors for this important borough may be sure that they wiU never gain that position in the country which they have a right to occupy until they make up thetr minds to choose as their representative a man who by his ability and public character is worthy to write after his name " Member for Bir"mingham." Nothi'ng can be more easy than to select some nameless person who will attend to their local jobs and prove a sound Parliamentary hack1 equally clever in tingle or cldouble harness; but is this what they really require ? The opinions of the Birmingham electors are decidedly Radical in the main. Is there any gentleman in the House of Commons so fitted to give weight to these particular opinions as 3Mr. BRIGHT? It is probable enough that on many points he would quarrel now with one section of his constituents, now with another, but, on the whole, he may fairly be considered the most efficient representative of Radicalism in the country. He is therefore a good man to reprewent Birmingham, as the late Sir ROBEXT LNGLIS was a good rman to represent the University of Oxford. It has been our un fortunate fate to cross swords so frequently with AIr. BRIGHT that we certainly shall not be suspected of undue partisanship when we thus advocate his acceptance by Birmingham. We respect, however, the energy and ability of the man, though they may at times have been misdirected. We would gladly see him once more a member of the House of Commons, for times are at hand when the services of such a member will be required. The tendency to elect local men, irrespective of their qualifications for public life, has been so much developed of late that, if not checked in time, the government of the country will be entirely committed to the hands of the regular occupants of the Treasury bench. The old Ins and the old Outs wiU change places with commendable regularity, and no voice wiU be lifted in protest against proceedings which are not always in harmony with the wishes of the country. We hope to avoid this, and shall be heartily glad if the choice of the electors of Birmingham shall fall upon our old opponent, Mr. BRIGHT, at whose return to health and strength we very sincerely rejoice.
The Crystal Palace shares with railways and -with other glories and delicis of England the inconvenience of not answering as a speculation. A Committee of Shareholders has just sat upon the affairs of the Company, and issued its report. The public will inspect with some curiosity the outgoings and incomings of its favourite, and will be ready with its condolence at the balance being so much on the wrong side. It will cause a little surprise to heiar that the gardens of the Palace at present employ 146 gardeners. The Committee not unreasonably thinks this rather too large a staff, and considers that a less number, with more supervision, will do as well. But it is not so much the expenses of the general management, which are not considered excessive, as those of the "frequent novelties and varied attractions," which incur censure. These latter, it appears, have been great failures. The HANDEL FeStiVal does not come into this report-why we do not know. But the other " attractions" have been all but universally losses. The " Peace Festival" cost the company 1,9081. and only brought in 6281., making a loss of 1,2801. to the Company. The Poultry Show cost 9391., the single article of coops being 1961., and only just cleared its expenses. The Flower Shows were a better speculation, bringing in a balance of 4821. But now comes the formidable head of " Opera Con" certs," under which the Comraittee considers the Company a loser of 5,0001. It seems that for 12 Opera Concerts the agreement gave Mr. GYX 10,0381., which sum various other items swelled to 11,4611. Then the Committee complains generally of the carelessness of the Directors in the contracts made, " which have been "onesided and much against the interests of the "Company." The Company, e. g., has lost 2001. -(6d. per do7en-in the course of the year by sodawater, the calculation being that it ought to have gained 3,0001. The difference, of course, has been in favour of the contractor. The conclusion which the report points to is one which any person of common sense could have prophesied,-that the " attractions" are not the attraction at the Crystal Palace. People go there for an " outing," for fresh air, a fine view, and a magnificent garden. A jaded Londoner does not want to see sights,-he is sick of sight-seeing,-he wants to get out of their way. They are part of London; he is glad to leave them with the smoke and toil of the city behind him, and to go somewhere where there is nothing to see but what he can see by simply opening his eyes. There is all the difference between sights: we see some sights by simply opening our eyes; we see others by "screwing" them. The connoisseur looks as DANTE describes his tailor looking when he threads his needlesqueezing his eye into the smallest compass. The organ is stimulated by compression, and shoots its Eharp arrows out of a corner of itself-a sort of essence of sight. But to look through a tenth part of one eye, or even to fix both with a constant tension upon curious objects, is not so healthy or pleasant or cheering a process as to look with two good open unconstrained eyes upon land or sea or sky. The reason why flower shows are such popular sightsfor they appear to have succeeded even at the Crystal Palace-is because nine people out of ten haidly look at the flowers. There is just a hasty glance throwni round two or three tents-we look at the banks of azaleas, and pimeleas, geraniums, and calceolarias, and then the eye reposes with dreamy pleasure upon the successive waves of the well-dressed and brillant crowd, or we listen in " a wise vacancy" to the strains of music from the band. The Londoner, then, goes to the Crystal Palace for the freshener which the air and the landscape give him. fie eats his cold dinner and drink pale ale with the heartiness of a rustic, and goes back to his work again. This is his attraction. A concert is no more to his taste than a gallery of pictures or statues. He can hear concerts enough in London. He does not go out of London in order to sit still on a chair, with only moderate room for his legs, for three hours. It is quite true the Crystal Palace is miore liberal of room to the knees than Exeter-hall; it is possible to sit out even a concert there and not feel yourself in the stocks. This is a great and undoubted merit; it is almost a revolution in the musical world. It, at any rate, deserves to be marked as an era in the history of music. The HANDEL Festival gave the satisfaction it did principally from the single fact of the perfect comfort in which the performances were heard. We throw no reflection on the Tocalists or the orchestra, on the choruses or the solos, bub no music can possibly entrance when the space between the back of your own chair and that of your neighbour's before you is less than the length which nature has made from the knee to the hip joint. There is an insurmountable obstacle to anything like ecstasy under such circumstances. No man was ever enraptured in the stocks. It is one of the remarkable consequences of the new Crystal architecture that it enables music to be heard without pain, and gives room for numbers without undue compression. Space and profit-those old and mortal enemies-are at last decently reconciled. But, with aU the superior resources which the Crystal Palace possesses for concerts, concerts are not the attraction to bring the masses out of London. Everybody knows SIDNEY S.r1Tsx's opinion of concerts. They require singular patience, and they impose an unnatural stagnation of your limbs for smn e three hours. The masses want something m:uc!h more fzet anld simple. The HANDEL Festi.al was an " event," and appealed to a large upper class possessed of ample leisure and purse; but ordinary concerts wiU neither bring the upper classes nor the middle ones. If the Crystal Palace Cornpany will take our advice they will try a much shorter and simpler mode of courting the public. They have already in the air, sky, and landscape which the place commands the great attractiona which appeal to a Londoner. It only remains that they should give him as good a lunch or dinner as is practicable in this unculinary country. Let the Refreshment Department be attended to. Let the pale ale be the very best, the wine excellent, the attendance unexceptionable. If they give the " best good dinner" that can be had, the Crystal Palace is sure to be popular. Let the price be only fairly remunerative. It wiU be a mistake if they try to make 3,0001. a-year by sodawater. Let them be content with the shillings as their main payment. The shillings will come in when good and cheap fare is to be had. Look at the thousands who go to Greenwich and other places simply to dine. The Crystal Palace, with its superior accommodation, its magnificent gardens, its prospect, and its band, ouglnt tobe able to outbid humnbier rivals. There is another point to attend to. The Crystal Palace is by no means easy of access from some parts of London. It takes as long to go from Belgravia to Londonbridge as to drive to Sydenham, and therefore for all that part of London the railway is useless and a carriage is necessary. But how few have carriages or horses, or can afford to have them ! The price of admission may be only one shiling, but the conveyance will be one pound. There must be new railway accommodation before one-half of London can make the Crystal Palace a place of resort.
THE IMPERIAL VISIT TO OSBORNE. There is literaUy nothing to record regarding the movements of the Imperial visitors. As we informed our readers at first, there is no probability of their tour being extended beyond the precincts of the Osborne demesne. During Saturday even the airing in the Royal yacht was given up, and no visit of inspection was paid either to the James Baines or the Champion of the Seas. The weather only was the cause of the latter change of intention, as even up to 10 o'clock the visit was fully anticipated by the authorities. Yesterday was of course passed in quiet, and to-day (Monday), at 2 o'clock p.m., their Majesties wiU embark again on board the Reine Hortense, and return to France. During all the early part of Saturday the weather was wet and very squally, blowing in sharp cold gusts from the north-west, so that all hope of a RZoyal or Imperial visit to the clippers James Baines and Champion of the Seas was finally abandoned. The vessels lay at Spithead steady as rocks amid a rather plunging sea, with one-third of the men, as usual, keeping their incomprehensible watch over the rain and sky, sheltering themselves under bulwarks, or looking over the side with a bilious despair, auguring badly for their com fort in the Channel. There was the usual number of last commissions to the shore and from the shore perpetually going forward, while the troops below were getting their breakfasts amid a Babel and confusion to which an Eastern bazaar is nothing. Trusses of hay, piles of canvass, spare stores, game, and live fowls strewed the decks in abundance, the latter occasionally adding to the animation of the seene by getting loose and scrarmbling overboard, in spite of the furious zeal of the soldiers in pursuit. The most general employment on board seemed that of letter-writing. Every one seemed to have a few last words to say, from the officer with his half-a-dozen notes down to the poor private labouring heavily and wearily in the construction of every line or sentence. Mr. Mackay (one of the owners of the Black Ball line) visited both ships to see that all the arrangements for the convenience and comfort of their gallant freights on the voyage had been thoroughly carried out, and the result of the inquiry was most gratifying. All that coldd possibly have been done by the contractors has been done, and a printed notice was posted about the ships on Saturday stating that the owners did not intend to limit the troops to the allowance of bread according to the scale of the East India Company, but trusted to their honour that, while making use of any quantity they might require, none would be wasted. In accordance with this liberal regulation, open casks full of biscuit are placed at intervals along the troop decks, so that every man helps himself to any quantity he pleases and at any time. When Mr. Mackay quitted the ships on Saturday the troops showed their appreciation of the liberality with which he has behaved throughout by cheering almost loud enough to make Spithead echo. The vessels were ordered to get under weigh by 11 o'clock, but there was such an earnest entreaty made by the officers that they might remain till half-past 11, in order to get their final copies of Thle Times, that, somehow or other, the benevolent tugs managed it, and a large number of the papers were sent on board just before the farewell gun was fired, and the two vessels commenced their long voyage. All right-minded readers of our Parliamentary debates must often have shrunk with horror from the pictures drawn of anonymous newsDaper writers when their " misstatements" are exposed by the officials of the House of Commons. Who is not conversant with the variety of flat contradictions which are always kept on hand to meet these " anonymous" emergencies, how they were resorted to at the time of the Crimean campaign, and with what result. The question of clothing for our troops going to India just now occupies the attention of all persons who wish well to the Government of that empire. On Thursday night, in the House of Commons, in reply to a question from Sir H. Willoughby as to what provision had been mnade on that subject, the UnderSecretary of War (Sir John Ramsden) said "t the most satisfactory way in which he could answer the question would be by reading, with the permission of the House, the list of the articles issued to the troops on their arrival in India, in addition to the ordinary supply of necessaries," &c. With this customary official preface, which, it will be observed, commits no one to anything, Sir J. Ramsden read out a list of summer clothing like a cricketer's outfit, concluding with the announcement that, in order to insure materials best adapted to the climate, they were " made on the spot." This " made on the spot" will be the loophole of escape in the present instance, for, if questioned again, Sir J. Ramsden will, of course, be armed with statistics to show tbat six months is the shortest time in which the adopted clothing can be "' made on the spot." Now, we are requested, on the best authority, to state that in nearly every case it is six or eight months before any of the regimentsarriving in India receive their light clothing I But the statement which chiefly pacified the House, and to which we beg to direct attention, was the concluding remark of the Under-Secretary, in which he said,- ` In addition to these the troops now going out to China and India have been provided with white cotton helmet and forage cap covers. In fact, the Government have taken every precaution to maintain the health and comfort of the troops." For this direct assertion we regret to say there is not the least foundation. No "white cotton helmet" or " forage cap covers " of any kind or description whatsoever have been issued to the troops which have lately left our shores. In heavy marching order they have embarked; in heavy marching order they wvnll disembark in India, and must, of course, in the present emergency, instantly move against the mutineers. It is no exaggeration to say that the officers of the corps which have lately started have been oppressed with dread as to the effects of the climate on their men while muffled in their present equipment. If any regiments should have been provided for, surely it was those which sailed yesterday-the 97th, 20th, and part of the 42d Highlanders. Yet we know that these men had not a single cap cover, and that they will laud in India in the same uniforms in which they quitted Aldershott and Shornclif, without as much as a cloth to cover the hidcous black shako, which is truly nickuamed in those regiments the " Sepoy's Friend."

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES&OFFICE, ill-miay Morining, EXPRESS FROMt PARIS. The followinig is the letter of our Paris corre'8pondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- When the private telegraphic despatch was re -eived here from iVienna on Friday announcing that the French Ambassador at Constantinople had pulled -down his flag because the Porte had not satisfed his demani(ds, the Mlinisterial papers were recom.mnended not to notice it, as it was untruie. The .recommendation was, of course, obeyed. It is now, 'however, admitted by the same organs that the Representatives of France, Sardinia, Itussia, and Prussia have broken off diplomatic relations with -the Porte, the cause of the rupture being the refusal *of the Porte to declare the Moldavian elections null and void. Every one knows that the union of the 'Principalities was, in the very outset, a great object .with the French Government; the electious of MAIoldlavia are um1favourable to that uniion, and they are consequently denounced by the French Forcign office, its Ambassador at Constantinople, its Com%aissioner in the Principalities, and its press in Paris, on the ground of pressure exercised by the Moldaviani Government, and tho generally *:llegal manner in which those elections were con*ducted. The immaculate Conslibdiunwel, shocked at the wick-edness of petty siiners, and at the folly of barren deliniquoencies, cailnot sufficienitly express -its horror at the nisdeeds of Voegorides and his -agents. It cries,- " PartWiality, violence, fraud of every sort, shameless inter. vention were the commrentaries on the law in Moldavia. sThe electoral lists were framed in such a manner as to cause ,icandal throughout the country. All presnmned opponents were elizminated. Several Prefects, divers honourable func. lionaries re*i,ned their places rather than participate in those frauds," &c. Nothing could better describe the recent elections in France than these words, and the Co'ustiftduiO',an will, perhaps, be recommended to avoid such suggestive dsscriptions in future, and to deal mnore in generalities. The " partiality, frauds, shameless intervention, the commentary on the law, lists 'iramed to the scandal of the country, presumed opponents ECt aside !" How deeply the wvriter of 9ihis article must have been imspressed with the recollection of the French clections to write in so -forcible a manner ! Thero is one point, however, at which the parallel must stop,-that where the Co7stitjtti-e-l tells us that " Many prefecta and divers honiourable functionaries (Mloldavian, of course) resigned rather than lend themselves to such acts." The Moldavian functionaries have cor*tainly, in this respect, the advantage of -their Co1ft,'r'es in France. The only casualties which have occurred to such people here are a few translationis here and there, earned by the more or less zeal displayed in the acts described by 'the COostili,,moiel. The French functionaries may *well laugh at the simplicity of their brothers of Mloldavia. The French Government is perhaps a friend to the purity of elections in Moldavia ; but its zeal, like charity, does not begin at home, and it -is not likely to end there. Its ision may be keen and searching on the Danube, but it passes over what takes place on the Garonne, the Ithone, or the Loire. It may be true that the Kaiinakan Vogorides, in imitation of his great French model, has committed the acts which shock the sensibilities of the Constit-iinel, but to the I"rench Government, who would be silent had Moldavia declared for the union of the Irincipalities, he may refuse the right -of censor. The French Government, so angry at illegal interference in these elections, forgets that it was its own official organ that first assumed the tone of dictation towards the Principalities which marked its subsequent conduct towards )Neuchatel. The object of the Treaty of Paris was to ascertain the sentimenlts and wishes of the Principalities on the reforms requisite for their governmlent. The French Government took the initiative by declaring in the M?onilour in favour of the union, and it is no secret that its Commissioner has been a p'Lrty mian throughout. Prinice Vogorides has said or thought, " What you teach me I will execute ; and it shall go hard but I wvill btter the - instructie,,." It is now said that the Kaimakan demands an inquiry irnto the circumstances attending the elections, but that the four Powers have refused to take his dninaund into consideraqion. The anxiety of the French Foreignl-office about the union is variously accounted for; it is perhaps owing to the desire of annoying A ustria, who held out against Rlussia on the l'elgian question, and who is opposed to the establishment of an independent IRotunaiii nation, seeing that 4 or 5 millions of her on n subjects of the Eame race may also aspire to independence ; or, perhaps, to the anxiety to provide well, but at a distance, for a Prince whose Liberal tendencies render his continued presence near at l4lnd an inconvenience. The troubles whicli might follow the union of the Principalities, and which woould weaken Austria's power in Italy, may perlhaps explain the part Sardhiia takes in the present uivestion. l. Kisseleff, the lRussian A nibassador in l'aris, nioro than once (leclared his convice tion tilat the union of Moldavia with WVallachia is not po.sible witlhout a foreign Prince for Sovereign. Tho Sovereign, whether native or German, would most probably be at the beck of Russia. Pnussia of course sides with Russia. Be this as it may, it is probable that the discussion which appears to have set at loggerheads the Diplo matic Corps at Constantinople, will have been dis cussed, and perhaps settled at Osbornie before the Emperor's retuLrn. So, at all events, it is expected here. The Emperor will probably leave Osborne tomorrow night foir Ilavre (not Cherbourg, as at first proposed), will proceed to Rouen to visit the new church of Xt,i,c D,,I ' I L, leo ,1;'cors, the inanufacturring establishments. where he will re-assure the manufacte r"rs as to the Customs reforms, will dine at the Prefecture, and return to Paris, or St. Cloud, on Tuesday uiight. The Minister of the Interior has addressed a circular to the Prefects of Departmsents recominending them to keep a strict watch over all foreigners 'who appear te have no legitimate means of existence. A State paper has been drawn up at the War-office on promotion in the army, which conmprises several generals and several colonels. The Committee on Fortifications have been caUed on to prepare a report on the fortifications necessary in Kabylia. The Piedmontese Government has been authorized to take a copy at the War-ofice of the plans of the fortifications of Alessandria, executed under the Empire by General Chasseloup-Laubat, of the Emgineers. Marshal Pelissier has arrived at Marseilles on a visit to his friend, 31. Lucy, Receiver-General of 'the department of the Bouches-du-RhOne. The remains of the Prince of Canino arrived on the 4th at Ajaccio in Corsica. They were received with all the honours befitting the rank of the deceased. The Prince has left his valuable collection -of objects connected with natural history to the Paris Museum. Orders have been despatched to Admiral Treiuouart to return with the fleet to Toulon, to celebrate the Emperor's f6te on the 15th August. The period of Admiral Bouet's service, who commands the fleet in the Levaist, will expire in E;eptember next. He is to be succeeded by Admiral de Lagravicre, who was chief of the staff to the late Admiral Bruat. A private letter from Alexandria of the 26th annotinces that his Highness the Viceroy was still at Defne, near Rosetta. The situation of the country was excellent, and according to the news from the provinces the state of the harvest was most satisfactory. Private letters from Naples of the 3d announce that the King of Naples has cormmuted the punishment of Nicotera, Pisacane's accomplice, who had been condemned to death by a Council of War. In consequence of this clement measure, Nicotera will have to remain in perpetual seclusion. The UnirerS publishes the following letter from M4onsignor Guasco, Bishop of Fez, Vicar and Apostolic Delegate in Egypt. It is dated Alexandria, July 27:- "Monsieur le R6dacteur.-I have read in the Unirers a letter dated Alexandria, June 13, in which the apostacy of 450 Greeks of the United Church is announced, who had rather become schismatics than adopt the Gregorian calendar. You, Sir, published this artiole with reserve (sous toutes less rserVre_s) ; you will therefore, I am confident, feel happy to learn that it contains nothing but exaggeration and error. I feel myself compelled in the interest of religion and truth to give an accurate and brief statement of the facts. Considering the defects of the ancient calendar, the numerous and incontestable advantages which would result from th adoption of the Gregorian calendar, wishing to combat the unfortunate tendency of sonie Melchites who secretly made common cause with the non-imited Greeks, X. Clement, Patriarch of the Melohitos Greeks, thought propc- to in. troduce among his nation the use of the Gregorian caIendar already adopted by the Syrian and Armenian Catholics, followed from time immemorial by the Maronites. For this purposo he addressed a circular to al hiis Bislhops, in which he commanded the rerep. tion of the aforesaid calendar. Some Bishops unfortunately showed but little readiness to cause the com. mand of their Patriarch to be respected, and thus gave time to some Catholic Greeks to manifest their oppoeition. Tho latter, with the most iniquitous bad faith, endeavoulred t, take their countrymen by surprise, and lead them into their revolt againist the authority of their Patriarch. They pretend that nothing else is contemplated but to destroy the Creek worship, and to substitute a new one. This imposi. tion is carried by them even to Constantinople, and they implore the protection of the Sultan against their Patriarch. It is useless to observe that these oppositionists are of the number of those who for a long time past have been only nominal Catholics, who wish, contrary to the holy canons, to make themselves masters of the elections of the patriarch and bishops, and to compel the clergy to be jerL-ly the humble slave of their caprices. In this town after a thousand efforts made to attract to their party those who have refused to obey, and to seduce by all sorts of means those who have adopted the Gregorian calendar, after having distributed numerous circulars, soughs adhesions which they have not obtained, published protests, covered with supposititious signatures,they have opened in a private house a chapel, at which a priest of their nation long since disgraced and suspended, officiates. The authorities found it necessary to interfore, and to close this schismatic chapel. It was then that 17, and not 400, of these oppositionists, at present reduced to five, threatened to join the non-united Greeks. The Holy See, notwithstand. ing its desire to find all the eastern Catholic Churches conform to the Gregorian calendar, has not, however, given any order. It has not commanded the Melehites Greeka to rereceive it. For example, the Latin Bishop, its delegate for Egypt, has done nothing to force them to it. Ile has been satisfied to use every means of persuasion to Induce them to receive the aforesaid calendar according to the formal wich of the Patriarch. Such are the facts. To explain theni simply is to reply scifficiently to the assertions contained in the extract from tho letter above-mentioned. I trust, Sir, that you will please to give a place to this reply in tbeo columlns of your estimable journal, the ever faithful and devoted defender of all Catholic interests." The following private telegraphic despatch has been received "MADRID, AL'G. 7. " A postal treaty is being arranged between France and SpVin. " A Director of Public Order is to be established at the lome-office." TURKEY. The Presse publishes two diplomatic documents. The first is a communication from Redschid Pasha o the English and Austrian Amibassadors. It ays :y " The efforts of the Sublime Porte to settle the difference which has arisen respecting the elections in Moldavia having proved unavailing, and the telegraphic despatches received by the Ambassadors of France and of England being susceptible of a different interpretation on tho subject of agreement between the French and English Governments respecting the adjournment of the elections for eight days -an adjournment which expires this day (18th)-tbe Sublime Porte proposes a furtber delay of 15 days, to aUlow time to procure by telegraph an explanation of the views of I the two Governments." In reply to the above the Ambassador of England and the Aiustrian Internuncio sent the following- "The Ambassador of England and the Austrian Internuncio, while rendering justice to the Sublime Porte for i s efforts tending to conciliate the difference which has arisen respecting the elections in Moldavla-efforts in which they ully participated--must point out the inconveniences which would result from such a delay, and regret that the best means for an agreemiient on that subject should have been refused. "The Ambassador of England declares, for his part, that 'ho sense of the despatches appears to him sufficiently clear, and that he does not discover in them any idea that a further adjournment of the elections is contemplated by his Government. The Austrian Internuncio shares on this point the opinior of bis colleague of England. Consequently, they have mutually come to the conclusion that the Porte cannot granit a new delay without leaving the position assigned to it by the principle of the Treaty of Paris-the comnmlon work of the Powers; and they add that they do not shrinik from' any responsibility that may result for the Porte from this refusal of adjouirnment.

M. de Thouvenel, however, was of opinion that he could not accept the proposition of the Porto, and he insisted on the inmmediate and unconditional annulment of the elections, at the same time declaring that, if his demand was rejncted, he should take down his flag within 24 hours. On the 5th, the Porte repeated the foregoing proposition, adding that if M. de Thouvenel should persist in his original demand, such persistence would be considered equivalent to a rejection of the proposal of the 'orte, and lie (Md. de Thouvenel) must be responsible for the consequences. At the same time it was made known to the French Ambassador that the Sultan intended to address a letter to the Emperor of the French on the subject. * elhe consequence of the communication of the Porte was that the French Minister had his flag struck. He, however, at the same time informed Aali Pasha, tho Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he did not intend to lLave Constantinople for some days.

Deutsche Post-a paper which is generally believed to be inspired by the AustrianIForeign-office-is not of the same opinion, as will be seen by the subjoined summary of its leader of this morning:- ' In order that tho violence of the French Government towards the Sultan may be properly understood, the efforts of the l'orte to satisfy the pride of France will be reca. pitulated. In the first place, the Sultan dismissed Itedechid, who is nearly related to him by marriage, from his post of Grand Vizier, and then offered to bring the Kaimnakans of moldavia and Wallachia before the forum of the representatives of the Powers at Constantinople. If the l'aris Cabinet considered Iedschid a statesman who acted in systematic opposition to it, it has now the satisfaction of seeing a man who enjoys its confidence placed at the head of affairs. " As the French Government asserts that the partial repoi ts of its agents in the Principalities aro more woi thy of credit than those sent in by the Lieutenants of iney arnvecl yesterday in thQ forenoc. ihe Sultan, the Porte offers to summon the latter into the presence of M. de Thonverel and his colleagues. The Porte appeals to the rman who directly represents the Emperor Napoleon, and offers to let him be one of the judges of the conduct of the two Kaimakans. France, how. ever, violently rejects this well-meant proposition. Sbe wants 'obedience,' and not an examination into the merits of the case. It is the question of subraission, and not of right or wrong. I The order has been given at Paris, the Sultan is to lumiliate himnself, the Porte is to mutilate itself, a Monarch is to be brought low and trodden underfoot in the presence of his subjects, he is to revoke his own decrees, and to declare that his sovereign acts were illegal. But yesterday introduced into the family of European Sovereigns, and reinstated in his rights ia Moldavia and W allachia by the efforts of four nations, the Sultan is to-day expected to submit to the punishment to which he has been sentenceed at Paris." The writer in the Ost. Dleutsche Post, who takes delight in high-sounding phrases, denounces the " overweening pride" of France, declares that the annulment of the elections in Moldavia " would be the ainulment of the suzcrainetM of the Porte," and concludes by observing that France "1 seems to bave undertaken the realization of the last will and testament of Peter the Great." If the article was written in order to make the relations between Austria and France still cooler than they at present are, the object has probably been attained, but if the writer intended to render a service to the Porte he has done his work veiy clumsily. Within the last few hours an opportunity has presented itself of conversing with persons who cannot but be acquainted with the intentions of the Porte, and the impression on my mind now is, that the Turkish Government will permit the French Embassy to quit Constantinople rather than consent to annul the elections. The Commission of the States lying on the banks of the Danube persists in its refusal to permit the representatives of France, Russia, Prussia, and Eng land to have any insight into its doings, and the consequence of this reserve willprobably be another " misunderstanding." The il Riveraine" States think that any resolutions they may take in respect to the future navigation, police, &c., of the Danube must be accepted by the other Powers, but paragraph 19th of the Treaty of March would seem to show that the resolutions of the "I Riveraine" States will have no legal force unleus they are confirmed by the Paris Conference. it is related that some of the States insist on maintaining their right of overhauling the goods in the holds of all vessels which may pass in transit through their territories, but it is difficult to believe that such is really the case, as seals on the holds would be sulfficient protection against smuggling. The presentation of the Diplomatic Corps to the Archduchess Charlotte (of Belgium) took place at 1 o'clock yesterday. The impression produced by her Imperial Highness on all those persons who had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with her was extremely favourable, and her talent as a linguist excited general admiration. The youthful bride, who speaks French, German, English, and Italian with equal correctness and facility, was so easy in her manners and so graceful in her movements, that His Majesty the Emnperor declared his new sisterin-law to be one of the most charming persons he had ever seen. The Archduchess Charlotte is pretty, and has wlhat is called a " grand air," but still she will not bear comparison with the Empress, who has such a face, expression of countenance, and form as are rarely seen. After the " Drawing Room" there was a grand dinner at Court, to which 140 persons sat down. According to men of high rank, the Imperial family is extremely pleased that the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian met with such a kind reception in England. On the 4th of August the amount of specie in the Bank was 94,(569,286fl., and bank-notes were in circulation to the value of 3933,706,77911. The metallic reserve of the Bank was only 412,437fl. larger in August than in July, but the value of the banknotes in circulation was greater by 10,403,169fl. On the 31st of July the Sheik-ul-Islarn and the Ministers held repeated consultations in the Imperial Palace at Constantinople, and it is supposed to have been deciled on that day that the MIoldavian elections should not be annulled.

FOREIGNL INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE.- (FROM ("DR OWN CORESPO(D-FWTA PARIS, SATURDAY, AuG. 8. After your reporter quitted the Court of Assize yesterday the President continued to sum up the evidence against the prisoners with great impartiality. The jury remained in consultation 40 minutes, and shortly before 6 o'clock they returned a verdict of guilty on all the counts against the three conspirators, but with extenuating circumstances in favour of Grilli and Bartolotti. The Court then sentenced Tibaldi to transportation and Grilli and Bartolotti to imprisonment for 15 years. The prisoners heard the sentence without betraying any emotion, and were removed in silence. The Attorney-General has appealed from a judgment by which the nI6s-ret Pablic of Tarbes was acquitted of having published false news in a late number. The editor has been summoned to appear before the Imperial Court of Pau on the 13th inst. It would appear that the change of weather in Paris has been general in the north of France, the heat having diminished very considerably, and rain having fallen, though not in any great quantity. It would appear also to be extending to the south, as the Lyons journals state that after a long continuance of extreme heat rain had commenced falling in that neighbourhood, and that the appearance of the country vwas ia consequence much improved and refreshed. I At 6 o'clock yesterday morning the thermometer of M. Chevallier stood at 14 3-10ths centigrade (57T Fahrenheit); at noon, at 19 centigrade (66k Fabrenheit); and at 2 o'clock, at 20 5-10ths centigrade (68k Fahrenheit). A letter from Genoa of the Gth inst. states that MM.

The supplement of the Itadlia del Popolo had been seized at Genoa on the 5th inst. It contained a third article, signed " Giuseppe Mazzini," on the situation of affairs in Europe. He endeavoured to demonstrate in that article what the duty of the population of the Sardinian States is during an attempt at revolution in Italy. The Cattolico was seized the same day, and its editor imprisoned. The lIorimtento was seized the following day. Accounts from Naples of the 26th of July inform us that the Count of Syracuse immediately after his arrival from France proceeded to Castellamare, to give an account to the King, his brother, of the conferences at which he had been present at Vienna and Paris.

The elections are over ; yesterday was the day for 'the towns. The system of abstention which pre- vailed in the other classes was followed by the Unionists in this class too-with what succems it is not easy to say, for the accounts differ as usuial considerably, and there are no means of satisfying them. Thus, in Jawsy, according to the Unionists, more than one-half abstained; according to the adverse party, 227 came out of 300 and odd, which would be a fair propor-1 tion. The result is, as with all the other elections, without one single exception, the members chosen are supporters of the Government-that is, Separatists; as the Unionists spent their energy in abstention and consistency it could not be otherwise. Neither party seems very much satis( ed with this result. The Separatists complain that by the abstention of the Unionists the country has been deprived of the lights of some good and clever men who might have been elected. This complaint may be translated into more intelligible language by saying that they are afraid of their own success, and do not quite know how to use it. The Unionists, on the contrary, seem to begin to have an apprehension that they have let the bird in the hand loose to catch the two in the bush. They console themselves with the idea that they have acted consister.tly, and trust to the promises of their foreign supporters, by whose advice they have been led in a great measure. The clo'je of the elections will probably lead to an armni'tice between the two camps. The elections have to be ratified at Constantinople, and then it rem,.ins to be seen what the commission will do. I Tdre are, indeed, among those elected men who t .ink, the Divan being once chosen according to the iruan,nothing remains but to assemble,express their wishes, and then communicate them to the commission, taking thus the initiative. The men who reason thus start from the point of view that the Divan once convoked, nobody has to interfere with its labours. But I don't think that this wiU be the opinion of the majority. The most probable supposition seems to me that the great mass of the deputies, especially of the two lower classes-the small proprietors and the peasants-will have no opinion whatever. They have been chosen for their support of the Government in the case of the peasants, without having a distinct idea of what they were doing; so they will naturally wait for instructions. I don't mpan to imply by this as if I had decided the question about the falsification of the lists, for if the Unionists had carried the day those classes would not have been more independent; I want merely to remind your readers that by its very nature the Divan is more calculated to follow outward impulse than to take the initiative. Past history tells us, indeed, of strange fits of energy in assemblies where that quality was least expected; but, unless the Moldavian character is cbanged outright, I don't think future history will have occasion to reckon the present Divan of Moldavia among these examples. The impulse to which the mass of the Moldavian deputies will be subject, at any rate in the beginning, 'will probably be that of the local Government, and the position of the latter is such that it disposes it rather to tardiness than to hurry. The Government of Moldavia is nominally independent and responsible, but in reality the duty of Kaimakan is like that of the Barbiere di Seviglia. It is a case of " Figaro qul" and " Figaro EL," " Figaro su," and " Figaro gia," so that the good man does not know where to listen and what to do. Owing his post to the Porte, he is, of course, most anxious to pleas3 the latter, and this is not easy. The reason of it is that the Porte on its side is about in the same position as the Kaimakan, it being the Figaro of Constantinople, and having a good many queer customers to please. Now, when the Unionists of Moldavia sent their protestation against the electoral lists to the conimissioners at Bucharest, the four among them who are favourable to this party were satisfied with the proofs brought forward by the Unionists, and determined to stop the elections by an order from Stamboul. The Porte, hard pressed on one side, was on the point of yielding, when a corresponding pressure was applied on the other. At last a compromise was come to, and the Kaimakan of Moldavia received at the eleventh hour a telegraphic message to postpone the elections for a week, and was at the same time instructed to be so moderate as not to give offence. It was very likely in consequence of these instructions that the 300 reclamations out of 520 were recognized as valid. One day passed after another, and the week of delay was drawing towards its end without any orders for or against the elections having arrived. In vain were all the telegraphic messages asking for instructions, the return wire remained silent. The position was uncomfortable enough. Threatened with a sure disgrace at Constantinople by the French Consul if he did not stop the elections, and promised the same by the Austrian Consul if he did stop them, it required the flourishing health of the Kaimakan not to break down under this double pressure. It was plain enough that if he stopped the elections, knowing how anxious the Porte was that they should be proceeded with, he had little mercy to expect ; and if he did not stop them, and the Unionists got the upper hand in Constantinople, he was liklewise a lost man. The silence of the Porte showed that he was destined to be the scapegoat, and that they desired him to remove the risk of acting one way or another from the shoulders of the Porte on his own, so that they should be at liberty to back him up or to disavow him, according to the turn things might take. If there had been any doubts remaining about the intentions of the Porte they would have been removed by the news from Constantinople, which was to the effect that this interval of a week was to be employed in one or more conferences of the foreign repreeentatives with the Porte in which the subject should be settled. Somehow or other the conference never took place, whether through the fault of the one or of the other party I cannot tell. As thus no contrary resolutionis could be taken, the Porte let things go their own way, being only cautious not to commit herself by any positive order. This may have been very deep diplomacy for aught I know, but it was, I am sure, bad policy. It was shirking the difficulty, and trying to carry an important political question by an awkward strategem. All the difficulties in which Turkey found herself in this qnestion are owing to similar diplomatic dodge in which she had invariablyto give way. It is to be regretted that experience has not made her wiser. After all the movement and excitement about these elections, could it be expected that the commissioners who supported thecomplaints of the Unionists against the elections in Moldavia would be played off in this way 2 It is not very probable. The local Governmeut feels this, and, having already taken more responsibility on itself than it can bear with safety, it will hesitate to go on without positive orders. As the firman does not fix the time which must elapse between the elections and the convocation of the Divans, this can scarcely take place without an understanding being come to between the parties. It iS probably to leave time for this that the Kaimakan intends making a tour through the country. JULY 30. I had scarcely sent off my letter yesterday when the news arrived that the four Commissioners of France, Russia, Prussia. and Sardinia have protested against the validity of the Divan, the result of the late elections, and that they have declined any communications with it. Their respective I consuls in this place have been instructed to iay this protest before the local Government. By this step things have been brought to a crisis. No compromise is now possible, and either one party must give way or else t he commission must be given up as impracticable, until the question of union is decided by the Powers themselves. You have only to recall to your mind the exact state of things to see that there is no third alternative left. Four of the seven commissioners have declared the Divan which has been chosen for Moldavia unlawffully elected; two have recognized its validity, and one has hitherto kept aloof, not joining in the quarrels oi either party, but trying to conciliate them. I need not tell you that it is the British Commissioner who finds himself in this position of arbiter, as it were. It was easy ta foresee that if a crisis ensued, wvhich, according to all appearances, could not be long avoided, he would have the casting vote. Things have come now to this crisis, and it is now in the hands of the British Commistioner to take the lead in the commission. He can do this so much the easier as England, by her daily-increasing commercial relations with the Danubian Principalities, is more than, perhaps, auy other Power interested in the real welfare of those countries, and can have no ar-iire pens6ee in her policy wvith regard to them. The moment has come when this position of neutrality must be exchanged for one of activity, and never were circumstances more favourable. The validity of the elections is questioned, and the proofs for and against it have been placed in the hands of the coummission. Surely the British Commissioner is more fit than anybody else to judge about the fairness or unifairness of an election, and, as he has not-joined eitheir party, he cannot be suspected of partiality. The weight of England thrown into the scale on either side must weigh it down. If the proofs on either side should be insufficient they might be easily completed by a commission sent to the spot, who should not be content to hear the case of both parties by their organs in the capital, but who should go to the outlying districts and endeavour to ascertain the truth in that way! Unless some such course is followed, I do not see how the commission can go on, and nothing remains then than to return to woat ought to have been done at the Congress of Paris last year. Had the question of union or not union, which is the apple of discord, been adjudged on that occasion, all these difficulties would not have occurred, and instead of tearing each other to pieces both parties would have endeavoured to make the best of their position, and to build up something stable on the foundations laid down by the treaty. In the struggle about the tnion or non-union all matters of internal organization have been set aside, and instead of entering on the praztical field the discus- sion of theories turned all heads. Though seemingly the longest road to arrive at the definitive organization of the Danubian Principalities, suspending the work of the commission until the question of unlion should be decided by the contr-acting Powers would be In reality, perhs, t mQS expeitbious way

TO THF EDPITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-What is likely to have been a clerical error appears in your report of my observations on moving the second reading of the Superannuation Bill on Friday. As a word erroneouslyattributed to use may appear unjust and offensive to a most deserving class, I shaU be much ohliged if you will -et me rieht with them. I am reported to have said that I consaidered that the increased public charge produced by the BiU would he more than compensated by the "improved conduct" of the civil servants of the Crown. This would have been contrary to my arumnent and to my opinion. My words were, that I hoped the public would be more than compensated for the increased charge by the II improved condition" of the civil servants. This observation is supported by the authority of the Royal Commissioners. - -I am, Sir, your very obedient servant- - - MONTEAGLE. rarfs sree;t, Augtist S.

IRELAND. (PROM oiR oww nn~vq~ A DUllLIN, SATURDAY AlORiaNo. TE WRDDER OF X.MR. LITTE. The Dublin journals of this day are literally awamped with the proceedings at the Commission Court yesterday. The trial, it is reported, cannot be brought to a conclusion before Tuesday, and it may be that the fisueie will be postponed to a day later. The able address of the Attorney-General tills nearly eight columns of the papers. He gave a clear and masterly history of the tragedy, beginuiing on the fatal 13th of November, down to the arrest of Spollen, minutely analyzing the evidence, which, he contended, without a shadow of doubt, fastened the guilt upon the prisoner at the bar. A great portion of the earlier part of the speech is devoted to the facts which have been frequently published in The Times, connected with the discovery of the murder, the subseq ent investigations before the law officers, and the failure of all attenmpts to trace the assassin. The first clue given to show that the murderer was on the spot was the disoovery of the bag of silver on the 12th of December last:- The Attorney-General adverted to the position of the prisonier in the company, and his employment as a handy nman in mending the roof of the directors' ouse and painting the wundows. The rght hon. gentleman pointed to a model of the premises and continued,-There was no person in the employment of the company who, from his duties, had such an intimate knowledge of the building itself as the prisoner; nay, more, from his duties you would not have been surprised at all, no matter what part of the building he might have been seen in. Lf he had been seen outside one of the windows on the roof it would not have attracted any particular atten. tion, for his duties led him to all those places. He was not only in the hablt of being on the roof, but his mode of going on it was twofold. One window, which lookedout on the roof belonged to Mr. Little's offieo. A window beyond that represents a window next to that of Mr. Little's room, and it looks upon the lobby of the back staircase, which I have before spoken of, and upon the second lobby of that back staircase is a small pivot window, so constructed that anybody can go in or out of it. The experiment has been tried, and there Is no doubt about it, and, in fact, it will appear, although it was not known at the time, that the prisoner was In the constant habit of going on or coming off the roof by that window ; so that any one could easily get to Mr. Little's office or back again by that window. There was no difficulty in passing from one side of the roof to the other without touching the glass. On the glass porbions there are what are called snow boards, and there are also valleys between them, so that you are at once safe from observation, and have also a secure footing. On one end of the roof there was commonly a ladder placed a4ainst it from the part of the terminus known as the third-class watercloset; and by that ladder Spollen was in the habit of getting on the roof, so that be bad a perfect knowledge of the roof and of the meana by which a person could go along it. Mr. Little's room, it will be seen, is visible from the prisoner's cottage, and it would not take saore than three minutes for a person to go from hIr. Little's room across the roof to that place. Tbere lived with the prisoner his wife and four children, The eldest son. James, aged about 17, was also in the em ployment of the company - the second son, Joseph, is in his 14th year; and his daughter, Lucy, aged about 11 years. There was also another child, of tender years, to whom it is not necessary to advert. Upon his arrest, I should mention to you, not only had he the performance of the duties whioh i have described, but recently he bad had recourse on several occasions to Mr. Little's office. He had had special recourse there so lately as the Saturday previous to the murder, Be had been employed in doing EomO repairs to the fixtures, and actually on the Saturday before the murder he had been employed in some varnishing work in the office. I mention these facts for the purpose of showing the knowledge of the place possessed by the prisoner. In the month of November or December the police required every one in connexion with the Dremises to account for himself on the evening of the murder, the prisoner among the rest. His statement was taken down, and it was this -He said that he finished his work at half-past 5 o'clock, which was per fectly true ; he stated further, that having left his work he went straight home, and remained there from half-past 5, reading a book and taking his tea, until 9 o'clock, never leaving home in the interval, and that at that hour he and his wife and eldest son went down town, and returned between 10 and 11 o'clock, and that is also true, with the exception of the statement that he was at honie at half-past 5 o'clock. That statement wil be contradicted. The police having arrested Spollen, they proceeded to particular inq Ures; and in a case of circumstantial evidence, where there was not and could not be any direct testimony, they naturally proceeded to find out whether the plunder for which the nurder was committed was concealed on the premises. The building presented innumerable places which could be availed of as hiding places, so that, unless you had some private source of information, an ingenious person could easily find a secure place of concealment; and certainly much ingenuity was shown by some person in this instance. [The Attorney-General then minutely described-referring occasionally to the model-the localith in which the money was discovered the particulars of which are already known, and continued.) Of the sum of 130l. found on that occasion a portion was formed In several par. cels, although it was all roiled up in one cloth; among the rest there was a sulm of 411. 7s. found together. This was quite separate from the rest, and this 411. 7s. exactly corresponds with the amount of ' surplus' money returned in the account in Mr. Little's handwriting. There was also a further sum of :31. 5s., which was also kept separate, rolled together with a fourpenny piece and a penny in copper, and this exactly corresponds with an entry in Little's account of the ' surplus' received on the 30th of October. On the 30th of October he appeara to have received , surplus' to that amount, and that sum was found separate, although in the eame roil as the others. There was a sum of 21. 6s. Ild. also found, and the evidence as to it is much more satisfactory, because there is a living witness who wi'l prove its being a sum of money transmitted to Mr. Little a fewdays betore his murder. M r. Miller, stationmaster at Atlilone, will prove that ho received a sum of money to that amount as surplus money-that be had muarked it himself, and that it had been forwarded to Mr. Little. I have alluded to the lilac cloth in which the money was found; It wiU be produced to you, and you will seo what it represents-namely, a child's sun-bonnet. The evidence which I shaU subsequenitly advert to, coining from a quarter that is free from any suspicion or doubt, goes to prove that that sunbonnet belonged to one of Spollen's children. Spollen was employed to do a great deal of work up and down the line, anId was somnetimes sent even to Gaiwav; and, working in that manner, he had consequently a qantity of oil and red lead occasionally in his possession, which was used for the purpose of working into putty, so that you will easily understand that this vessel containing red lead was criginally in Spollen's place in the liquid state, and had become solid from the effects of the damp in which it was found. The discovery of tlc small brass padlock in the red lead excited surprise. On his arrest the prisoner had been searched, and asked by the police for his keys, which he gave, and among them a key which opened a drawer, in which were ls" found a smaU brhass padlock and a key. It appeared at the time a circumnstance of not the snmallest importance; but the discovery of the lock in the red lead lproved it to be of the greatest importance, because the lock found in the drawer was found to correspond with the one in the red lead. The ley fitted the two, and the one discovered in tho lead would be opened in their presence, and they would fild that tlho one key exactly fitted the two. The question was, had Spollen ever two locks' One had been found in his drawer, hut had he the second? It would be proved that in the early portion of his employment he had two oil cans with the calne locks on thel,, one of which was not forthcomiinlg on the search, the solution of which was probably this, that by one of those providential circuinstances by xvhiohl murders were discovered the second lock dropped accideutally into the red lead while in a soft state and got initbecdded in it, subsequently to be discovered, and fornm one link in the chain of circumstantial evidence which at the close of the case he would submit was sufficient to warrant them in finding a verdict of 'Guilty.' The nmonev was found rolled up ill a cloth, which, wheever brought it th-re, undoubtedly caume froni Spollen's house. 'J'hisand other circuumstances would be proved by the evidence of two of his children, Lucy Spollen, his only daughter, and Joseph Spollexi, his second soim. It was always a niost melancholy expodient to have to examine a child to sustain a charge which implicated not only the character but the life of his father; but in this case the o:licers of tho Crown were placed in this position, thlat they ihad but the alternwative of ither taking the course which they had, and which was alr.ays to be deprecated, or giving a chance of escape to a person against whom there was evidence that he hadi btec guilty of a relentless murder. Lucy Spollen would depose that her father did not conie home athalfpast 5 o'clock on the evening of the murder. IHe had stated that he canme home at that hour, and remained reading unt 1 9 o'clock. According to her evidence every portion of his statellient was untrue. He did not return at halfpast. 5 o'clock, but her brother James returned, and took his tea as usual with his mother, The younger chLildren took their tea after their mother, and a wonsiderable time after that, late in the veuning, about h o'clock, some conminunication took place between Spollen and his wifo. Spollen did not enter the house, but his wife weiit outside, and a communication took place between thenm near what is called the smith's house. It was a bright moonlight night, and somewhere abont 8 o'clock that evening the two children, for the first time since dinner, ,t 12 o'clock, saw through a window their father get a smimall ladder, which he ascended, proceed upon the roof of the grease-house, do something at the chimney of the forge, which was part of the same building, and stuff something down the chimney. Although the place was called a forge, there had not been a fire in it for five years, and it was used for the purpose of tarring covers. After sonie time their father came into the house, and he and their mother and eldest brother vent into town. The statements of the two children substantially agreed asto that, and also in this re-pect, that after the murder, while the police were carrying on their inquiries, their father told them, if thev were asked anytliimig about a cloth or piece of chamois, to say they knew nothing at all about it. The boy Joseph Spollen also stated that he remembered his father having two little padlocks for the oil cans. Let them now see the maeans of access to and of escape from Mr. LIttle's room which the prisoner would have, supposing him to be the murderer. Thore was a small baok statrcase inmedi%tely contiguous to the room, and any gerson gettilg inside there could be in Mr. Little's room In alf a minute. RHavng access to the roof, he could easily get into the room, either by having seen from the roof Mr. Little leave the room for some temporary purpose, or he might bave got there by knocking at the door, and, being a person well known and working in the room, it was not difficult to conjecture that Mr. Little would admit hitm. The mail train in the evening left at a quarter pat 7 o'clock, after -which hour the porters left the termxinus, and the gasInmps, with one or two exceptions, were put out, so that if a person intended to commit the murder that would have been a most favourable time to select for it. The murderer could have proceeded along the valley of the roof of the railway, and get down conveniently into the watercloset of the third-class department. 'There was no danger of disturbauco there then, for every one was gone. In the office of the deceased, Mr. Little, there was found a napkin stained with blood, showing it had been used to remove traces of blood by the murderer. The key, as he had already stated, w.s missing, as were also the instruments of murder. A search for these was made, and shortly after it commenoed Mr. Hodgens, one of the railway officers, called attention to the end of a stick which appeared to be standing up in the mud, and on Its being taken out it proved to be a hammer. It was called a fitter's hammer, though it was not a complete one. It was heavy, and such as was likely to have been used in the commission of the murder. On the end of the handle, as it came cut through the iron head, would be seen red lead, and traces of the same on the handle itself. The paint-shop of the prisoner was searched, and in a press opened by a key in his possession was found an ordinary glazier's chipping hammer, and another large hammer, not unlike that found in the canal, smeared with putty, apparently by design. The children at once identfied the large hammer found In the workshop; they said they had been in the habit of using it to put nails in the waUs, and for other purposes about the place, and that it was in the same condition, except that it was not smeared with putty. They stated they saw it about the place up to a day or two after Mr. Little's murder, and not since. The inference deduced by the Crown-it might be a strained one-was that the hammer with the red lead upon it being Spollen's, he abetracted the hammer used by the children to supply its place, and that he snmeared it with putty to show it had been used by him in his work. They had not been able to discover that any one saw him using it. The second instrament used in the murder was undoubtedly a sharp instrument, and in the course of the first search a razor was found in the canal after the searchers had gone to dinner. It was assurmed this was tho razor with which the throat of Mr. Little had been cut. It being supposed the object of the search was accomplished when the ammer and razor were found any further search was given up. It having been ascertained, after Spollen's arrest, that the razor found in the canal in November never belonged to him, it was suspected that it was placed in the canal by design, and was not the instrument used in the murder. A further search was then made, and it was conducted with greater care than the first. After some timo a second razor was found in a place that had not been previously searched. One of the main objects of that search was a key, but it was not found. The Eecond razor had been under the water for a long time. At the same time, upon examination, itwas found that there was traced, not verv distinctly, but legibly, with some sharp instrument, the word ' Spollen.' This of course excited somae suspicion on the part of the authorities. One of the policemen saw it taken from the mud, and it had been in his possession ever since. The first question was, was the razor the prisoner's ? and it would be proved beyond a doubt that the razor was Spollen's. In the course of inquiries it was taken to the shop of a Mr. West, a cutler-for it was observed that on the two razors found in the prisoner's house hls name was traced with great care, whereas the razor in ouestion was markediust as a cutler would do who had it for the purpose of doing something to it. Mr. West was enabled to identify the razor by the name, as one that had been some time before in his house; that it was brought to him by some one; he said it was his own hand that traced the name ' SpoUlen' on it, and he was satisfied that the person who brought it to him must have spelled his name, becanse if he had merely said 'Spoilen,' he (Mr. West) would have speUed it 'Spoill, whereas the name on the razor is spoUed I Spollen.' lie had now to call their attention to other circumstances connected with tbe case. On searching Spollen's house the police, in addition to the lock and key he had mentioned, found rolled up in a pieee of cotton in a press eight sovereigns, some of which e-libited evidence of having come in contact with a wet substance. That circumstance was too minute to rest upon it, but the fact that in the prisoner's drawer a sum of eight sovereigns was found was a strong element of suspicion, for it would not be very usual for a man in his position-having 24s. a-week-to have so large a sum ; but having it in soverei us added to the suspicion. It would be proved to them that a person going to conceal the money in the place where it was found should pass by the ram, which was generally working. Whoever hid the money of couirse, would have to go down to take it away, and in going down, if he wished to protect himself, he would stop he ram. It would be proved that about two months before the period of Spollen's arrest the ram was found to be stopped on a Sunday morning, having been stopped on a Saturday night. Since the arrest of the prisoner the ram never stopped. Only a portion of the missing money was discovered under the privy - the rest, except a smalU sum in silver, amounting to about '1. found in the river Bradogue, was accounted for. I have now (said the Attorney-General), at too much length, perhaps, for your patience, offered for your consideration, and explained, as far as I could, and as sbortly, the long chain of circumstances by which we say the finger of proof is pointed at the prisoner James Spollen as the murderer of Mr. Little. Gentlemen, you have all the chain of circumstances surrounding the prisoner, and pointingat him, proved by a number of witnesses who hardly can err in the case; and if these fasts be established it will be for you to say whetner the irresistible inference does not arise (and that is the way we submit it to you) that James Spollen is the murderer of Mr. Little. You wiU have to deal with the whole of this case. It is one, as I have stated to you, of circumstantial evidence, and I cannot do better than adopt, as my own observation to you, part of the instruction which was delivered to the grand jury by the learned Lord Chief Justice as to the way in which they should deal with circumstantial evidence. I-His Lordship told them correctly and truly what was their duty in respect to circumstantial evidence, and I most willingly adopt his language; and I only wish I could give utterance to my opinion in language o clear and accurate :-' The case has to be proved, not by direct evidence, but by circumstantial evidence-by a chain of facts which will be presented to you as establishing, by presumptive evidence, the guilt of the prisoner. That sort of evidence, gentlemen, is not only perfectly legal and allow. able, but in some respects, perhaps, it may be considered as a firmer basis upon which to come to a conclusion, thau simply the direct testimony of a witness saying he had seen or witnessed the fact. A single witness may be deceived or may err, or may desire to deceive; but a long chain of circumstances, of facts established by the testimony of a number of witnesses, all tending to furnish the same circumstances and lead to the same legitimate inference, must, not only from the number of witnesses whose credit is committed, but from the wide sphere of the examinations, give a greater opportunity for a fuU and ample investigation of the case.' Gentlemen, it is with such a chain of evidence you have to deaL * The first witness caUed was Mr. Franklin, who had prepared the model exhibited in court. His examination was principally confined to statements respecting its correctness. Mr. Curran endeavoured to prove that its measureinents were faulty, but the witness explained away the objections raised. * Air. Robert Boylan proved the accuracy of a mnap which lhe had prepared of the premises of the Midland Railway at the Broadstone. " Mr. Chamberlain, the clerk of the late Mr. Little, was examined by Mr. FirrznisnoN, Q.C., and deposed that he had last secn Mr. Little alive at 5 o'clock on the evening of the lith of November last. At that time he was in the enjoyment apparently of good health. When witness was in the office lie sat with his back to the door, facing Mr. Little. When witness was leaving on the evening of the l3th Air. Little was sitting on his chair facing the door, and engaged in writing. The receipts which had come in on that day in notes, gold, and silver were in the room. On that day Mr. Tough was with Mr. Little; lie stood outside the wooden screen at witness's back, and he was speaking to Mr. Little. Mr. Tough left before witness. About a week before this time a, carpenter named Farreil, took away the lock of the door to make some alteration, but restored it again; whether the key was with it witness canuct say. On cross-examination by Mr. CuRnRAN the witness stated that Mr. Little was in the habit of giving to hr. IHodgens, who paid all the under-servants of the railway, as mluch as :3001. or '1001. at a time, made up in parcels, -Williamn Tough proved his visit to Mr. Little on the 13hof N ovember, and that Chamberlain was then bl'Auley, the cash porter, deposed to his having brought the cashboxes to Mlr. Little's office on the evening of the m oburder, about 5 o'clock, when the deceased was in the room. Anne Guinning, examined by the ATTORN-EY.GF-ERAL. knewof A r.-Little. The clerks uisually left about o'clock, but Mr. Little reained some tiae afterwards, occapsonall staying untillate ; his hours varied from 5 o'clock hon allf-pat 10. On the night of the mitrder I saw Thlornton in the house about 7 o'clock ; at about ii o'clock onu of MNr. Kirwans clerkzs came to mne for a light to go to his office, anid I gave himn someo matches. At abouLt half. past 7 o'clock I was going through the honu&, and observed on the wall, opposite the door of Mr. Little's room, the reflection of a light through the keyhole in the cash-office ; I turned the handle in the door, but could not make the door give. I got no answer. I then went through the offices. In the audit office I found Catherine Campbell. I know the prisoner James Spolfen; he was employed to clean the windows i I have seen him get out on the rcof for that plurpope. In order to got on the roof it was necessary to pass through a window which tuLrned upon a pivot. " Cross-examined by Mr. CURRAN.-Any person in the horse at a late hour would be obliged to go down the back stairs to the basement in order to get to the platform. On the night of the 13th of November Mlr. Klirwan's-clrks were In the house up to 11 o'clock, and the doors were therefore unlocked; any stranger might have had access to the corridor, could we have found the way; at the foot of the grand staircase there is a window, which is easily opened, and which is about three feet above the ground at either side; there were marks discovered of a person having obtained egress that way about the time of the murder. " On re-examination by the ATToRNzY-GxlEAzL the witness stated that on the evening of the 13th of Novembor, the door leading to the platform from the grand staircase was closed at 5 o'clock; in gaining a passage from the house by the back stairs a person would have to pawss by Elanbury's. *' To the CirizF JusTrcz.-I was laid up from the effects of a fall for six weeks previous to the time of the murder, and was not consequently able to move about much, so I did not return to see if Mr. IAttle had left; I trusted that to Catherine Campbell. * Bernard Ganning confirmed this witness's evidence. "James Brophy, the foreman carpenter, was examined by Mr. FITZCIRBON, touching the manmner in which he had obh tained access to the room, and as to what he witnessed there. HIe deposed to the position of the body, and then went on to say that a person leaving the terminus-house by the swivel window and proceeding along the roof, and deseending by a ladder, oould reach Spollen's sottage in a few minutes. As to the finding of the silver in the hamper In DecemRber, the witiasso stated that It lay in suoh a position that SpoUen had accese to it, and he had socn him in the neighbourhood of it. " On cross-examination the witness stated that he had had a quarrel with the prisoner, who had, he said, endeavoured to Injure his (witness's) brother; but he denied thAt he h2d ever said he would hang him. "Mrs.Gunning wasrecalledlor the purpose of heingasked by Chief Justico MONAHAN wh'ether she had obeerved the swivel 'window when she was going to or returaing from her own room on the evening of the murder, and as to whetber it was then open. She replied that she did observe the window, and that it was thea closed, but whether fastened or not she could not say. o" Surgeon George Porter was called to prove the charaoter o the wounds on the body of the deceased. On the front of the head and face there were five wounds, and on th5 remainder of the head were 17 distinct marks of violence the prinoipal wound was a little above and behind the left ear, and was of a nature to cause instant death; the iacision in the carotid artery was made before life was extinct, but the witness gave it as his opinioai that the principal wound on the head was given before the throat was cut; the first was given, in all probability, from the side, or when the murderer was in front of Mr. Little; witness had fitted the hammer now produced (that found in ths canal), or one very similar to it, to the head of deceasei. and found it to correspond exactly with the size of the wound. " Mr. Archibald hoore proved the removal of the money and securities from Mr. Little's office on the discovery of the murder. The examination of this witness was precedent to evidence of the amount short in the cash discovered; but the Court intimated that it was not necessary to pursua the examination on that subject. "M hr. Henry Beausire, secretary to the railway company was next examined by Mr. DoosoHuE; but his evidence was merely corroborative of former witnesses as to the finding of tbe body. " Dr. John Aldridge denosed to having rade an analysis of a red colouring matter which appeared on the jamb of the door leading from the hall to the passage to the platform, and also on the pieces taken from the egress gate. He gave it as the result of the test applied, of sulphuric acid and cbloride of potasb, that the matter was not human blood, but a red vegetable matter. " The youngest child of the prisoner was then put on the table; but counsel for the prisoner stating that the crossexamination could not possibly be concluded that evening, and that it was of vital importance that her evidence should be perfectly given before she left the table, the Court directed the child to be put back until next day. "1 On the introduction of this child the prisoner, for the first time, appeared discomposed. He became somewhat nervous and restless, moved from the seat which he had occupied during the day, and on his forehead, to which he immediately applied a white handkerchief, large beads of perspiration were observed. $ O'Beirne, the foreman painter, was the next witne5s. Ile deposed that on the morning of the day on 'which the sdlver was found in the bamper Spollen caine into the paintshop at 6 o'clock, with his outside coat on, and carrying in his hand a paint-pot, with a 'whitewash brush in it; that he tuned immediately towards a press which stood in the shop, and of which he had tho key, opened it, and placed the pat inside, locked the press and then proceeded to take off his coat; during the day the prisoner was observed to be an- iously peeping at the police authorities in the course of their inquiries. " Henry Osborne gave evidence to the effect that Spollen left his 'work on the evening of the murder at haLf-past o I hMeares, detective police-constable, described the finding of the money on the 24th of June, and produced the rag ia 'which it was enveloped. "John Miller, examined by Mr. FrITZGIBBOI.-I am stationmaster at Athlone. Itwas my duty to transmit the money to Dnblin. I transmit the surplus money separately. (Banded a document.) I transmitted that to Dublin on th3 28th of October last. I sent with it 2W. 6s. 10d. (Elanded a note.) The word "surplus" on the back Is in the hardwritin of my booking-clerk. The parcel now handed torme of 21. 6s. 10d. I believe to be the same I sent to Dublin. (Identifies another docket.) I sent with that dockas 21. 18s. 6d. on the 29th of October. The parcel handed t) me oorresponds 'with the one I transmitted to Dublin. There Is the word "'surplus" on the 21. note. It is in the handwriting of the booking-clerk. The money went up ia a locked box. "The witness was not cross-examined. "Mr. James Hogg was examined by Mr. ET,iac, and identified the parcels of surplus money forwarded from Athlone. "Mr. Isaac Christian, of the audit-office, 3Midland Grea' Western Railway, was examined by the AiyTrONRrYGE2nERAL, and identified surplus checks sent from his office to that of Mr.Little. ,,It being now a quarter to 7 o'clock the ArToBRNry. GE-NERAL intimated his intention of not going further, and special bailiffs were then sworn to take charge of the jury." SECOND DAY. DUBLIN, SATURDAY EENmiNG. The trial was resumed this morning at 10 o'clock. Ann Gunning was recalled for the purpose of having some questions asked of her by counsel for the prisoner. From her replies to those queries it appeared that there were several other modes of egress from the railway terminus besides that used by the prisoner as alleged on the part of the prosecution. Lucy S ollen, the plisoner's daughter, was next introduced and placed in the witness chair. The prisoner, at sight of her, became excessively nervous, his hands clinched, and his countenance, of whieh immobility is the prevailing cbaracteristic, was suddenly contorted by strong emotion vwhile sobbing, wbich an effort of powerful will succeede' in repressing, was for a moment quite audible to those ia his vicinity. The little girl was subjected by the Lord Chief Justice and the Attorney-General to a most rigid examination as to her knowledge of the nature and oblisations of an oath. The result of this being satisfactory'to the court she was sworn, and in reply to the AttorneyGeneral deposed that on the evening of the 13th of November last the prisoner came home about 8 o'clock that from the window of one of the rooms or tho ecottage she saw her father standing on the roo' of the greasehouse. It was a moonlightnight. Mrs. SpoUlea was standing at the door while the prisoner was on the rooV of the greasehouse. The latter was putting some " rouad thing in a lump" down the chimney. In about an hour an I a-half after she saw him on the roof the prisoner took hii tea. Her father was on the roof about 6 or 7 o'clock. H i ascended to the roof by a short ladder, which he dreaT up after him and reared against the window. Identifie. a fragment of calico, which she describes as the remnant o a sunbonnet presented to her by a cousin, but which was never used by her in consequence of it not pleasinR her taste. Saw this calico used as a duster about three month. before MSr. Little's death. About the pe-riod of MSr. Little's murder the prisoner told her that if she were shown a piece of chamois or a red rag to say that she had never seen them before. About a week before the prisoner's arrest ber mnother was taken ill at night. The prisoner was then requested by her mother to send for a physician and a clergyman. The prisoner, in reply, said that he would not allow a priest or doctor into thenhouso, and that the first'who would leave to go for them he would " have their life." Cross-examined.-My father was sometimes away from home when he was dovvn the line, but he never slept out o' our house for two years previous to the murder. At half-past 5 o'clock on the evening of Friday, the 14th of November, we heard that Mr. Little had been murdered. My brother heard it among the workmen. I am sure It 'wee on the evening previous to our so hearing of the murder that I saw my father on the roof of thegreasehouse. Daring the week in which the murder was committed I think my father came home at the usual hour, but I cannot say. The lunatic asylmim is at the back of our cottage, and from the 'windows of it, the roof and chimney of the greasehouse can be distinctly seen;- the greasehouse is very exposed, and is visible from all the spots around; across the window of the parlour of our cottage a table extends; a chest of drawers is also there. A curtain covers the window about half-way up. That curtain was drawvn across the night of the murder, and there 'was a candle burning in the roo,n. hly brother James took tea with my mother that night, and afterwards I and Joseph got our tea. The candle was then lighting. It was after 7, about half-past, when my mother and James sat down to tea. They were half an hour at it, and then Joseph and I were about the same time at our tea. Upon miy solemn oath, as I expect to be believed, I have used this piece of calico. I know it by the pattern. I have no mark upon it. J never washed it myself, nor do I kao v that it ever was washed by any person. I have heard conversations in the cottage by men belonging to the railway about people who wonld give information as to who murdered Mr. Little in order to get the reward. We were not looking for the reward, but we were speaking about persons who were. After I was first examined at the police-office I never spoke a word to my mother or any other person about what I had sworn, nor did my mother say anything to me about it. I never spoke a sentence to either of nmy brothers or to my mother about what I have deposed to here this day. On the application of counsel for the pri-oner the informations of the witness taken before the magistrates were The ATTORNEY-GENERAL proposed to ask the witness, bad she received any direction not to speak to any one about the evidence which she had given, or 'was to give 9 The COURT decllned to receive the evidence. In reply to questions from the COURT the witness deposed that, in orderto look out of the cottage window, she had raised the euurtain 'which covered it. There was room at eacth side of the table to approach the 'window.. She had 'no Motisve, except to look out. for going to the window. Dia not dO so i expectation of seeing the prisoner. The AT-ioRN EY-GEN'RAL, having examined the witness as to her iuformations, elicited the fact that her brothers James and Joseph came to the window and saw the prisoner on the roof. In the original information the witness depo-ed to having seen the rag which enveloped the money, and which bad been used as a duster in the cottage, on the day of, or the day before, the murder. She now said that she recollected it was three months previously she had seen it. The question 'vas then put-" What explanation have you to give to the Court and the jury of this difference in your evid.ene 1" WitneRs.-I don't understand you, Sir. In reply to a question from the LORD CurME JUSTICE, the witness, however, stated that tho discrepancy in her evidence arose from her better recollection now. This child gave her evidenco in a singularly cool and collected manner. She was throughout calm and self-pussessed to an extraordinary degree, and exhibited in all her conduct the possession of intelligence to an extent far in advance of her years. From tho moment she came upon the table until she left it her eyes were studiously averted from the countenance of the prisoner. The same observations hold good as applied to the next following witness. Joseph Spollen. examined by Mx. PrvxGrnooN.-The prisoner is my father. I am within a month of 14 years of age. I saw my father on the evening of the mnurder between half-past 5 and 6 o'lock crossing the lines and proceeding towards the terminus. He had something swinging in his hand. I do not know what it was he carzied; it appeared to be something lengthy. I next saw him about 8 o'clock on the roof of the forge. I was then at the parlour window. My father was standing by the chimney. He was standing on what I thought was a plank which was raised from the roof to the set-off of the chimney. We were induood to look from the window in consequence of our 'wonder at my father being so late away from home. Mly brother George was the first to see my father on the roof I recognize two razora out of the four now shownra me as bel4nging to my father. I do not know the other two. The rag now produced belonged to my sister. My father told me about the time of the murder that if the police should show me a piece of red rag or chamois leather to deny all knowledge of them. The hammers I now see belonged to my father; one of them he had lent a short time before Mr. Little's death; another was in the old paint shop; and the third was nsed for nailing up scarlet runners. (The witness here gave evidenoe in corroboration of the previous witness with respect to the prisoner's conduct driang the iUness of his wife.) The locks now produced are those which my father used to fasten the oilcans. He had them both up to the time of Mr. Little's murder, but soon afterwards he had only one. Cross-examined.-Previons to my father's arrest I took a key from his pocket and opened a drawer, in which I saw eight sovereigns and 17s. 6d. in silver ; I counted it over and put it back. I was in the habit of going to school regularly. I don't think I was at school on the day of the murder. I positively say I never swore that I was at school on that day. I saw Lucy nearly three years ago, wearing the sun bonnet. I never used it as a duster myself, but I know It by the pattern. I do not think I told my mother what my father desired me to say about the rag or chamois in case the police showed them me. I did not on the day of the arrest know what it was for, but asked a policeman. I held no conversation with my mother or any one else about it. " The witness's informations were here read over by the Clerk of the Crown. In those the witness made no mention of having seen the prisoner from dinner time (I o'clock) tiU the period when he saw him on the roof of the old forge, and, in fact, said that he did not see him within those hours. He was now asked for an explanatlonof this discrepancy, as well as to explain why it was that he had stated tkat he was at school every day during the week in which the murder was committed, while now he said he was not at school on the day of the murder. He made no reply. " Mr. FITZGIBBON asked the witness a few questions arisng out of the cross-examination, and elicited the fact that the prisoner's wife and dAughter were both away from home on the day of the arrest, and had been so for a week previously. "Inspector Ryan, of the detective division of the metro. politan police, deposed to statements made by the prisoner as to his whereabouts on the evening of the murder, by whbich he endeavoured to account for his tiume on the railway premises up to 9 o'dock, and then from that hour to ten minutes past 10, at which time he alleged he returned with his wife after the purchase of certain necessaries. Tlis witness also deposed to the finding of the razor towards the end of June last, with the name 'Spollin' upon it. The blade of this razor was quite black when taken from the canal, but a red rust formed upon it upon exposure to the Bar. "H enry Nagle, Joseph West, James MoglL and Donelly, a constable, were then examined, but their evidence was not materiaL I' Alocksmith was nextput on the table to open the brass padlock found in the red lead bucket in which the silver was concealed in the privy. On the cap being removed and the interior exposed to view, it was observed to be quite full of red lead. "E vidence was then given of Spollen having in the course of his business received red lead, but in a square box, not a round tub in any way similar to that in which the silver was found. A witness was also produced to account for only one razor being found in November last. This he did by showing that the dam put up did not include within its compass the spot where the second razor was found. " The Court had not risen when our despatch left." (BY LECTRIC AND NTElNATIONAL TELEGRAwP}I) D:UBLIN, SAvnRDnAY NIGIIT. After the examination of several other witnesses as to miatters of detail, the case for the Crown closed shortly before 8 o'clock. Mr. Curran will address the jury for the defence on Monday morning. It is said that only one witness wfll be called for the prisoner-namely, James Spollen, the eldest son. THE DVllO. In the Dublin Freenawn of this morning there is an account of one of those nearly-forgotten incidents of Itish life in the past ages, familiarly known as " an affair of honour." The casus billi, as in nine cases out of ten, was " a lady." Here is the bulletin:- "Mr. John T. Walker, Mr. W. W. King (17th Lancers), Mr. Francis Edward Thomas, and Sir 1. Hutchinson were brought before the sitting magistrates yesterday in custody -the first named two gentlemen charged with having intended to fight a duel yesterday morning. Mr. Thomas and Sir E. Hutchinson were also arrested as accessories. The scene of the intended rencontre was a retired spot in the vicinity of Kilbarrack churchyard, near Howth. The police authorities having received information of the intended duel took every precaution to prevent it, and constables selected for the purpose succeeded in arresting Mr. King and Sir E. Hutchinson at Kilbarrack churchyard. Mr. Walker and his second, Mr. Thomas, were taken into custody on their way to the appointed place of meeting. The principals in the transaction (Mr. Walker and Mr. King) were released from custody on their entering into their OwVn recognizances of 1,0001. each, and two sureties of 2501. each. Sir E. Hutchinson and Mr. Thomas were discharged on becoming bound in 5001. each to keep the peace. The cause of the intended duel is said to have arisen out of a misunderstanding between the principals relative to a lady, a connexion of one of the parties."
THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH. On Wednesday afternoon the Knight of Kerry entertained the Lord-Lieutenant and the gentlemen connected with the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and others, at an elegant dcjkdn2cr, which was held in a storehouse tastefuUy fitted up for the occasion, and adorned with flags, wreaths of evergreens, and flowers. The " Health of the Queen?" having been drunk with all the honours, The CHAIRM31AN proposed "The Lord-Lieutenant, and prosperity to Ireland," which was moat cordiaUy responded to. The LoRD-LIEL-vx?ru-'T, on rising to respond, was loudly cheered. He said,-Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I beg to return you my hearty thanks for the honour you have done me in so kindly drinking my health. I believe, aR yotr worthy chairman has already hinted, that I am probably the first Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland whoever appeared upon this lovely strand. At all events, no Lord-Lieutenant coald ever have come among you on an occasion like the present. Amid aU the just pride and stirring hopes which cluster around the work of this week, we ought still to remember that we must speak with the mnodesty of those who begin and not as those who close an experiment; and it behoves us to remember that the pathway to great achievements has frequently to be hewn out amuid risks and difficulties, and that preliminary failure is ever the law and condition of ultimate success (cheers); therefore, whatever disappointments may possibly be in store, I must insinuate to yon that in a cause like this it would be criminal to feel discouragement. (Cheers.) In the very design and endeavour to establish the Atiantic Telegraph there is almost enough of glory; it is true if It only be an attempt there will not be quite enough of profit. I hope that wil coma too; but there is enough of public spirit, of love for science, for ouir country, for the human race, almost to suffice in themselves. However, upon this rocky frontlet of Ireland, at all events, to-day, we will presume upon success. (Cheers.) We are about, either by this sundown or to-morrow's dawn, to establish a new material link between the old world and the new. ({Hear.) Moral links there have been-links of race, links of commerce, links of friendship, links of literature, links of glory; but this, our new link, instead of super' 5eding and supplanting the old ones, is to give a life and an intensity which they never had before. (Loud cheers.) Highly as I value the reputation of those who have conceived and those who have contribated this bright design, I wish that so many of them had not been unavoidably prev,nttd fronm being among us at this moment. The link which is now to connect us, like the insect in the im. mortal couplet of our poet, " while exquisitely fine, feels a' each thread and lives alongthe line" (cheers); and may we feel, gentlemen of Ireland, of England, and of America, who may happen to be present, that we take our stand here upon the extremo rocky ledge of our beloved Ireland, - that we, as it were, leave behind us the wars, the strifes, and the bloodshed of the elder sisters Europe and Asia, and pledge ourselves, weak as our agency may be, inade quate in strict diplomatic form as onr credentials may he, yet in the face of unparalleled circumstances, and of the place and the hour, and the immediate neighbourhood of those mighty vessels, whose appear. ance may he beautiful on the waters, "e ven as are the feet upon the mountains of those who preach the gospel of peace." as a homege due to that serene science whioh often affords higher and holier lessons of harmony and goodwill thani the wayward passions of man are always apt to learn,in the face and in the strength of such circuinstan -es let us pl:dge ourselves to eternal peace between the O:d World and the New. (Loud cheers.) Why, gentlemen, what excuse could there he for misunderstanding, wbat justification won,ld there he for war, when the disarming message, when the full explanation, when the genial and healing counsel maybe wafted even across the mighty Atlantic quicker than the sunbeam's path or the lightning's flash? (Cheers.) I feal. gentlemen, that I shall best embody the sentiments which I am sure pervade this entire meeting, the sentiments rnost akin to this company and to this hour, if, after having duly drunk the health of the gentle Mistress of the British Isles, I now call upon you to drink with congenial honours to the lasting friendship of the British Islands and Americ%, and to the health and welfare of the President of the United States. (Loud and protracted cheering.) The toast having been duly honoured, Dr. PA LgEsR, of the Niagara, briefly returned thanks. "The IHealths of the Prince Consort and the Royal ramily" were then drunk. The CHAIRMAN, amid loud cheers, next gave "The Churches of both persuasions." The Dean of AWDFERT briefly returned thanks. ThoRoman CatholicBishopof KERRY also returnedthauks. He spoke as follows:-Knight of Kerry, Lord Carlisle, Ladies, and Gentlemen,-I have to return to your chairman and to you all my very sincere thanks for the honour you havo done to me and to the clergy whom Irep resent. I feel gratefal to the Knight for having alluded to the absence of religious dissension among us. For my own part I anust say, in cdeavoeting to preach peaee and geedvl among thepeople of this diocess, I consider that I am only carrying out the Divine mission I have recived in precohing a gospel which is preeminently and by excellenoe a gospel of peace. I feel I am only making a practical and logical infceree from inspired writ, which tells me that the love of my neighbours is the abridgment and fulfilment of the law; and In tho Catechism whiah I teach to my people the answer to the question, ".Whois myneighbomr7" gives mo the plain, comprehensive, and unequivocal reply, " Mankind of every description." (Cheers.) I am glad to acknowledge the uoIerfnl co-operation in this respect of the clergy over ahom I have to preside, and of the peaceful and gentle eople whom I have the happiness to govern. (Hear, ear.) I have als- to acknowledge with thanks the very efflcient co-opermti,n of mnany of the clergymen of another creed who mieet me with brotherly love, and I may mention the namiie of my respected friend Parson Sandijord, of Valencia, who, when I visit this island, is always the first to welcome *ime and the last to clasp my hand when I leave its shores. I molst aso acknowledge with great gratitude the c.operation of many of the gentry of this country, whoknow and lovethe people, who feel that thei-s and the people's iorerests are identical, who wish now that bygones shoxuld be bygones, and that the past history, which was unfortunately written in mutual hate, should be consigned with anathema to oblivion. (Hear, hear.) Among the first and foremost rink of those who wish to identify their creed and class with all that is liberal and tolerant and generous, I must name our distinguished host to-night (cheers), and in namlking him I cannot, standing in the island of Valencia, bet recall the memory of him whose title he bears-a title as dear to Kerrym4n as any that Royal patent could bestow. I cannot hut recall the memory of that ac. complished statesman who made the name of the Knight of Herry honouired in the Court and in the Palace, who in darker days fought the battle for religious freedom with a courage worthy the courage of the ancient chivalry, and who in the evening of his life, by his generous hospitality and the amenity of his manners, shed upon this island home of his a soft and mellow radiance, beautiful as the radiance which the setting sun sheds upon these mountains. (Lond cheering.) A few hobrs ago I was administering confirmstion in a parish in the mainland, but I hastened hither in obedience to the invitation of our host in the first place to pay my respects to the representative of our gracious Queen, and also to render my tribute of respect and admiration to those distinguished guests of the Knight of Kerry who are here the representativesof the power whose empire Ls greater than that of Rome or of Britain-Imeanthe power of science. You will excuse me if, as a clergyman, I make a soriptaral allu. sion. I remember when, in a spirit of selfish pride, men sought to build a tower that would reach to Heaven, the punishment awarded to them was the confusion of tonitues w%hich prevented an interchange of thought, and which led to the dispersion of nations; but when we meet together in a spirit of brotherly love, seeking each other's benefit, endeavouring to link together the old world with the new, the reward meted ont to us is a means of universal com. munication, so that the peoples become again of one tongue, and, like disembodied spirits, interchange thought from; mouth to mouth without human voice or the organs of human speech, but, touching the most secret springs of nature, find a power of expression in its voiceless tongue, (Cheers. There is a strange old legend which was sun, by mez iseval poets, and has latterly been versifi.1 by one of our living bards, Mr. MCarthy; it is said that St. Brendan, the first bishop of this diocess, set sail from this North Head, and, going westward, be met with a large continent. After travelling for a long time he met with a large river, and the legend says that he was then told to return to his own land. I know not what may have been the foundation of this legend. It may have arisen from the suspicion that prevailed amnong the learned for many ages that there existed another land beyond the western wave - but it seems to me that, as comirg events cast their shadow before them, the event which we inaugurate to-day is one of suoh gigantic dimensions that it has cast back its shadow through 12 centulries of time, and, as a proof of it, I am here, the last and least of St. Brendan's aescendants, to invoke God's blessing upon this glorious enterprise-the greatest effort that was ever made to reconquer the forfeited dominion of the maind of niean over the material world. (Cheers.) In this old world of ours we are fast growing old, but we are yetstrong. We know not the duration of power which 'rovidence may accord to us, but certain it is that the future destinies of the humnan race are wrapped up to a large extent in the futture history of that great nation which sprang from us, and is now growing up beyond the waters of the Atlantic. Re-echoing the sentiment of his Excellency, I will only express the hope that this cable, which is to link the old world and the new with each other, and which, realizing the legend of St. Brendan, has found its starting point on the coast of Kerry, may be the symbol of a fraternal and an eternal peace, that our intercourse and exchange of thought may in the future not be confined to the surface of the angry see, which is lashed by storms or traversed by icebergs, but that we may speak, mind to mind and heart to heart, trough the clear, calm depths of the ocean, where thera rriglt perpetual calm and peace. (Loud cheering.) 'lhenext toastwas "the Army and Navy," which was responded to respectively by Captain CIADS, R.N,, and General STOI;ES. The C}IAIRM?AS next gave " Success to the Cable," and in doing so said that the gentlemen who were conuected with that great work had not undertaken it in any paltry or selfish spirit, but with a view to promote the goneral happine ss and prosperity of mankind. Mr. BRoomING, one of the directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Colno-any, returned thanks, and gave " the KIingdom of Kerry," which was responded to by Mr. JAiEs O'COxNss.1-Tr The CHAIRMTAN then gave "the Irish RailwaysComrpasies and Sir Edward M'DonnelL" Sir E. M'DOSNELL, in returning thanks, said, the directors of the company over which he presided only panted for the day when they would bring the Lord Lieutenant down to open a line to V'alentia. The LORD LIFUTENAINT proposed, in eulogistic terms, the health of the Knight of Kerry, which was drunk amid great cbeering. The CHAIRMIN returned thanks, and gave " Our Indian Empire and Sir William O'Shaughnessy," to which Sir William responded. 'lie " Lealth of Lord Donraven" was next proposed, and was followed by the toast of "the Press," which was duly honoured, and to which Dr. Gray, of the Frccmanas's Journal, responded at some length. The toast of "the Ladies," proposed in humorous and graceful terms by the Lord-Lieutenant, concluded the proceedings of the d&.tjcsuc,r. In the evening a baU was held in the samne room, and a brilliant display of fireworks took place on the quay in Irouit of the Valencia Hotel. Tuesday, Aug. 4, 7 30 p.m. The Atlantic cable has just been successfully landed on the shores of Valentia Bay, and signals passed under the water fromn the temporary station on land through the whole of the cable on board of the Niagara, 1,250 miles in length. The landing of the cable was effected by the sailors of the American ships, who brought it on shore and laid it before his Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant. His Lordship and every one present who, owing to the dense crowd, were enabled to get near it, were anxious to touch with their hands this Eastern link of a chain that is desticed to connect the two hemispheres. After the landing the sailors were assembled round the Lord-Lieutenaut and the directors, and a special prayer for the success of the enterprise was offered up by the I`ev. John Day; after which the assembly was addressed by his Excellency, who demanded 12 cheers for the success of the cable, which were heartily given. The squadron is expected to sail for Newfoundland at daybreak to morrow morning. (BY aarrLSA AN-D IRIS1A MAGNETC CTLE(cri.\rl.) S.ITURDAY1 MORNING. Sooni after the ships sailecl for Newfoundland, an(d when at the distance of four miles from the landincr place, an accident happened to the thickest shore enid of the cable, which became entangled w"ith the machinery and broke at that point. The ships' boats were engaged until the afternoon of yesterday (Friday) in underrunning the cable from the shore to the place where it was broken, and thero joining the two ends again. This operation has been most successfully performed, the joint is as perfect as any part of the cable, and, the continuity and insulation of the whole length having been ascertained by the severest test, the squadron instantly set sail at about sunset in the evening of yesterday, and have kept up continued intercourse through the wire to the shore of Valentia since that time up to this hour. half-past 9 a.m. (Saturday). The ships are now 22 miles oil, weather beautiful, sea calm.
NATIONAL STAADARD THEATRE. The theatrical exertions of the east end of London ara not in the least regulated by tho "season" of the west. Elence, at the time when all the fashionable world is tbinking of quitting town as soon as it can the ruler of Oriental legitimacy" is beginning to look about him and devise plani 'or his ensuing operations. On Saturday last the regular season of the National Standard Theatre commenced with the appearance of Miss Glyn in Webster's Ducless of eatlf-a play which she has made exclusively her owu, shining blandly and benignantly tbrough all the horrors with which she is surrounded. Pcr a public that has hut lately emerged from the lowest stats of melodramatic barbarism to an admiration of "legitimacy" the Duchess of Malsf is one of the best plays that can be devised . for while, on the one hand, the language of Webster cannot be surpassed in vigour, his huge plot abounds in terrific incidents that would even call pallor into the cheek of a Victoria playwright. Those to whomn the poetry is caviarc can, at any rate, feast upon the atrocities, and thuis all parties are satisfied. Both on this play and on Antonyi and Cleopatra, which is distingiiishea by Miss Glyn's other great "Icreation," especial pains have been bestowed by the nianager, who is no slight adept in the art of stage decoration, and generally the annual arrival of Mliss Glyn at the eastern house is the signal for a kind of local festival. The eng.gement of this lady will be followed by an operatic period, during which Mr. and Mrs. Sinms Reeves who achieved a reimarkable success last year, will be the ruling "stars ;" and then will come another tragic epoch, during which Mr. Jarmes Anderson and Miss Elsworthy, who have recoently returned from Amierica, will be conspicuous. The spirit of enterprise which distinguishes the manager of the Standard cannot be better demonstrated than by the fact that the highest artists of the vest end have rejoiccd to shine at his establishment, so that the record of past enagements, which he proudly puta forth, looks like a list of the histrionic celebrities of the day in a process of rapid completion. Altogether, the progress of the drama in Eastern Leodon is a singular fact of modern times, which now, probably, is at the very beginning of its development. In early days we used, indeed, to hear of eastern theatres, such as the Pavilion and the Garrick, but the had an existence apart, being no more connected with the western establishments than the theatres of Deptford or Gr.vesend. It was with tho opening of Sadlers Wells by Mr. Phelps that the spread of the poetio dtama commenced, and there is not a heartier labourer in thQ work thAn Mr. John Douglass, of the Standrd
LYCEUM THEA TAE. The engagement of Madame Ristorl came to its termina. tion on SLturday night, when Dean Milman's trgedy-dt Fazio was performed before a numerous and distinguish.d audience, who took leave of the great axtlst with amiversi acclamations of applause. Of course, we have not now as much to say of Xadam, Ristor's peouliarities as last year, when sbe came before the public as an entirely new person, with entirely new attributes, displaying her talents under entirely new cirenm. stances. The high ideality of her style, her commnandin, deportment, the grandeur of her attitudes, the music of her deolamation, to which f ull scope is given by the beautiful Italian language, are now perfectly familiar to all the aris. tocracy of playgoers; and expressions which would have conveyed welcome information a twelvemonth since would now seem little more than a string of commonplaces. If we would draw a distinction between this engagement and the lt, we would point out the successful efforts which Madame Ristori has made to enlist the sym. pathiee of the English publia by appearing in characters belonging to the English repertory Lrst year she came as the Italian actress of foreign tragedy, rather iastructing her audiences then challenging their iudgment. This year, on the contrary, she has ventured on the theatrical as well as the physical soil of Britain, and by her highly impassioned representation of Bianca in Fazio, and the calm dignity of her Lady Macbeth has gained a new position with her patrons. The circumstance that her impersonations have nothing in common with the conventions of the English stage renders them only the more interesting, and there is no doubt that by the extension of her repertory Madame Ristori has extended likewise the circle of her admirers. The only new piece of the season has been the Camm,a of Signor Montanelli, who, known to us before its production as the translator of M. Legouv6's M6d,de, has now shown that he can do better things than transcribe the thoughts of others. Canmma is, in every respect, a fine work, deriving a novel aspect from the Celtic atmosphere in which the scene is laid, and presenting a heroine as grand as the old classic types, without repeating their peculiarities. New stories may be contrived ad libitum by little more than the exercise of the arithmetical rule of permutation, and ordinary life presents a huge crop of oddities that have not yet been touched by the author of drama or romance. But new Ideal personages are not so easy to find, and Signor Montanelli may be considered a very lucky man in putting his finger on a story in "Plutarch," which scarcely anybody had read, and in finding an artist like Madame Ristori, so exactly to depict the antique specimen of "feminine virtue.' Let us add, that he well merited his good fortune. Unlike the spendthrift, who wastes discovered treasure, he did not spoil the story he had found, but simply developed its contents. Taking into consider. ation the play itsel, the wonderfol acting ot hIadame Ris. tori, and the scenery of Mr. Beverley, we must pronounce the production of this play to have been the most interesting event during the wvhole of Madame Ristori's second engage. nient. Our familiarity with the plays of Alfieri has has not beenx greatlyincreased by the two visitsofhiadameEistor Mirram, which, when she played in it at Paris, produced an immense success, is deemed unfitted for the English stage on account of the incestuous idea associated with the plot, and Oftalria, likewise produced at Paris, has not been played here. To this latter piece there can be no moral objection, but we believe that experience has proved it to be deficient in effect, and that it created no great sensation in the French metro. polis. .Rosmunda, therefore, still remains to us the sole representative of the classic tragedian of Italy. Eowever, this is a matter that very little traubles the Englsh public. Madame Ristori herself is the grand object of attraction, and whether she puts forward the produce of her native land, a translation from Schiller by Siglor Mlaffel, or a translation from lL Legouve by Signor Montanelli, the audience are equally satisfied, provided her talents are suffi. ciently displayed._ ___
BIBTHS, DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES. A small and compact blue-book i8sed on Friday contains the 18th annual report of the Registrar-General on births, deaths, and marriages in England. This report relates to the year 1855, and from it we proceed to extract a few interesting statistical particulars for the perusal of oar readers. It appears that in the year 1S55, 304,226 persons were married, that 635,043 children were born, and that 425,703 persons died. Thus 1,364,972 new names were inscribed on the national registers. The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was 209,340, equal to the rate of 1-121 per cent. on the population, an increase greater by several thousands than that of the two previous years, 1854 and 1853. The number of mar. riages decreased, probably owing to the pressure of the war taxes and the high price of provisions. The decrease was 15,228 as compared with 1854. The number of births exceeded by 63S those of the lastyear, and the deaths were less numerous by 12,202; 176,S07 persons emigrated from the united kingdom, of whom 62,906 were of English or Welsh origin; and of these 27,883 sailed to the United States, 4,991 to the North American colonies, 29,863 to Australia, and 214 to other places; of the 62,906 emigrants, about 24,997 were adult males and 22,545 adult females; 2,125 were mere infants. The annual rates of 1855 were such that to 100 persons living there were marriages S10; persons married, 1-620; births, 3 380; and deaths, 2 266. The rate of marriage was below the average, and the rates of births and deaths were slightly above it; 1 marriage took place to 123 persons living, and consequently 1 person was married to 62 living; 1 child was born alive to every 30 persons living, and 1 person died to every 44 living. The observations of the Registrar-General now extend over IS years; and the resulting average rates for England and Wales are to, 100 persons living, 1-631 persons married annually, 3-2,6 births, 2 246 deaths; or 1 in 61 of the population is married, 1 in 31 is born, and 1 in 41 annually gives up the ghost. 127,751 marriages were celebrated according to the rites of the church of England, and 24,362 in other ways. Of 100 marriages, about 84 take place in the churches and chapels of the establishment. Only 14 were solemnized by " special license," more than 20,K56 by license, 99,546 after banns, and 3,S04 by certificates of superintendent-registrars. The proportion in 100 on the 123,750 distinguished cases gives 16-5 by license, 80-4 by banns, and 3 1 by certificate. The cost of the marriage license is unduly high, being about 21. 101., whereas the common fe]e for banns is only Is. The revenue of ecclesiastical offices under the the t ;vo heads muLst have been about 52,6131. for licenses, and 5,1854. for publishing banns. The poorer classes evidently felt the pressure of the times very severely, they having abstained from marriage far more than the rich. Higlh prices of wheat depress marriage among the classes (five out of six) who marry by banns to a greater extent than they depress it among the remiiaining one-sixth who marry by license. Consequently, as the annual average price of wvheat vas higher (,4s. Sd.) in lS;S than in any of the 1o sears since 1641, the proportion of marriages by banns to the marriages by license should be lower than it was in any of those years; and this was actually the case. In 1855 8,3S6 young men and 27,207 young wromen married as minors. The number of women who iuarry as minors has increased rapidly within thelastseptenniuiu. 21,940 widowers and 14,4Z5 widows remarried; 14,250 widowers married spin.-ters, and 7,6uA) married widows; and 6,77X5 widows married bachelors. The march of intellect is not very forcibly exhibited by the fact that 44,846 husbands and 62,672 wives were unable to write their naumes in the registers, but signed as " marks. men" and " markswomen." lt is enrious, however, that a "Icertain number" of the blushing brides who "make their marks" are actuaUy deterred by timiiidity or nervousness from writing their names, and many of those who do write them are anything but adepts in the art of calligraphy. "The means ef education,' patbetically renmarks the learned Rsegistrar-General. "must still be deplorably detective in England and Wales when we find 41 in lOg Women and 29 in 100 men making crosses instead Of writing their names in the registers of their suarrises" Ie is consolatorv, however, to find that the numnber of 'marksmen" and n;arkswomen " is on the decline. Each marriage constitutes a family, " and to the family" (writes the Regissrar) *the fact that one of its members can read and write is of more ioportance than the fact that both can read and write. l'ow, as 107,267 men and 89,441 women wrote their names, it is evideat that the 1Ri6,70S may have been so distributed in pairs as to leave no pairs in which neither the husband nor the wife could write. Such a combination, however, does not take place." The number of married couples in England in 183;-as about 3,150,470. The number of registered buildings for narriages (not churches) at the close of the year Was 3.658, of which 1,280 belonged to the sect of Independents, 37 to that of the Baptists, 642 to that of tho MWesleyan Metho. dists, and 440 to the sect of the Rlomanists. As regards the births, the ratio to the population is greatest in Durham and Staffordshire among the collieries. It is least in Rut. Ind, Devon, Hereford, Westniorland, Berks, Somerset, Rerts, and Oxford; the births bave decreased on these eight counties since 1850. 323, C0 boys and 311,083 girls were born in the ytar-104 boys to every 100 girls. In London the proportion of boys is greatly below the average of England and n Wales, 40,783 children (20,871 boys and 19),'.912 girls) were born out of wed. lock, giving the proportion of 6-4 baAtards to every 100 children born alive, or nearly 1 to 15. The counties to which this stigmia most attaches are Norfolk, lereford, Cumberland, S3alop, and Weasmorland; 42,5, 703 deaths occurred in the year, the annual rate was 2 -266 per cent. The mortality of males is at the rate of 2-348 per eent., and that of females 2187 per cent. The mortality ina 1S55 was below the average of the preceding decennium at &II ages under 45; after 55 the mortality was above the average of that period. In the three early periods of life (015) the mortality of males exceeds that of females, sad the Same occurs after the age of 35, but frna 15 to -5 the mortality of females is in excess. The' vinter of 1855 was remark-. ably cold ;the deaths amounted to 134,54%, and the oompa. rative sttisties show that the severity *f tke weather (a hard frost having prevailed for full six 'weeks at the beginning o, the 7er), wmas the caUSe of ruoge than 20,O00 deaths.
THE TUTINY AT BENARBB. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TINIES. Sirh-I beg to enclose a letter I have JUst received from my son, which I have transcribed. He gives an account of the battle of Benares and other events of which he was an eyewitness. As all Indian news is now anxiously read, I thoiglit you might perbaps deem the letter worthy of insertion in your valuable journal. I beg to enclose my name ancd address. Believo mIP sir Al-nh,lip,t RervanL A. P. SPENCER. 1.n. lao letter is to one ot his brotiers, " The Mint, Benares, June 9. "My dear Edward,-I continue my journial, which I closed and despatched this day week. There has been so little iaisure since to write th&t I must take the first quiet day, or 1 shall lose the tbread of events. The plot has thickened since then. The clouds which just showed on the horizon have gathered areund us, and one has burst just over our heads; but 1 must not anticipate. Let nme go back and relate each day's eveuts as they occurred to lae. Tuesday, the 2d, passed quietly over, B-- and his friend C-staying at mny bungalow; but on WVednesday a rumour came thst Si0 disbanded Sepoys were on our side of the river, opposite Benares, on their way up, and were buLrninig and plundering as they caine ; sowe called a council of war, and resolved that there was no examzple in history of three mes resisting l00 with any success to speak of, especially in a thatched bungalow, so we sent two sharp fellows to spy out the enemiiy, and packed up the office papers and drawings and sent themu to the fort, then dined, made ourselves happy with a pipe, and rode on heavily armed. Thursday morning, after a quiet night at the Padre's, my men came in with news that tlle 500 men were a myth-only think ; however, as we were in, and all the office papers locked up, I resolved to make a holyday, and stay in the station. Mr. C. was in a hurry to get to Benares, so we sent him off in an ckkea (a horrid native pony carriage); but just as we were sitting down to dinner, about 8 p.m., he canie back again with a seared face and told us he had niet two men in a buggy who had left Benares at 5 p.m. in full fight-grapeshot, ofiicers kiUed, &c., slightly confused, and rather awful. This time the intelligence was pronounced trustworthy, and we felt our work was going tobegin. We sent notes to the officers and held a council as to whether we should disarn the So or l)o Sepoys in Clhunar Fort. The Padre and all the unmi3£tary men said, I Certainly, disarm themn ;' but the officers said ' No, we will not show them that we mistrust them.' These words which I have quoted have been the death-sentence of hundreds of the bravest Indian officers. In station after station the samelo feeling has prevailed of conciliatilg the blackguards by ap. peariog to trust them, aud the appearing has gone on till they fire at thleir officers nithiout warning, You may be Sure we made every use of these arguments, but in vain, so we prepared for a stormy night. In the meantime, as I thouglht my Benares friends might fly this way, I sent out a horse to meet them half-way. Ve kept watch and watch, and tho evennig and the morning miiade it Friday, when I started at 4 am,m to Benares to see what it was all about, Three miles down tho road is Sultauipoor, the head. quarters of the l:th Irregldar Cavalry, only 50 men and a jemmadar were there, and they turnied out as I came along, and told me to give their salaani, to the Briga. dier, and say they were then ready to obey orders, and did not know exactly what to do. I promised to take their message, but said if they wanted immediate inistruction they had better tuor out a dozen men and coImO down witlh me. You see, an escort of cavAlry would rather have suited me just then; but they did not seeni to liise it, and said they had sent a picket on whom I might catch if I chose to ride for it So on I went, founil my second horse all right, and caught the picket about five miles from 13enares, and joined company with them. -s we went we asked everybody for news; as we got towards the place we Iniet another cavalry man coming fro;n Benares, and after some private talk with him my picket tried to shirk me, and, finiding they could not easiy do so, one of theem camle to me and said they had orders to join tho regiment privately, anid therefore must leave me. I did not like it at all, hut there was no help for it, so I rods on alone. However I got in safe, and saw some soldiers and English ollicers before me, and galloped up to them as fast as I could. From them I learnt the particulars of the fight, and that the English wero all assemb:ed at the old Mint, a large building capable of standing a very fair siege. And now wait a bit till I sing my song concerning the battle of Benarer, which was fought on Thursday, the 4th of June, 18-57. Imagine a s(uaro, the north side formed bv the huits of the 37th Native Infantry; west, Sikh regiments; south, the Irregular Cavalry; east, ;00 English and three guns, the hopo and last resource of lieniarcs. Elnter English officer, rides up to the 37th's lines, and order out the troops; they comne out, anid formn line in front of their huts; then each officer explains to his company that they are to disarm for the present till less stormy days. Onie officer, G-, my informant, actually shoOr hands with the chief imien of his company, and then ordered tbem to stel) forward and lay down their muskets. Their answer canic in the shape of 80 musket balls all round him; but not one hit Iim, nor vere any of the other officers killed in this first discharge. The mcn then feol back into their huts and commenced loading and firing under covor of thein at the English. Major Cuise, of the Irregulars, rode in among the huts, and w'4s killed allost imnmediately. The English guns took up a rakis,g position, and peppered the huts with grape at 250 yards. (ne of our officers camo forwarse with a few men, and fired the roofs, so the Sepoys got rather astonished. hMeantimiie thc 6iikhs left the cast side of tho s(luare and formed a line parallel to and between the Sepoys and cavalry, and facing the former The cavalry said they wanted an En,gl4h ollicer to lead them, and l)odson of tho 317th, who had julst escaped the first fire of his own corlps, came forward and was irnmediatcly received with one or two riflo balls from the cavalry. IUpon this t3e Sikhs faced round and lired a volley, but whether intonded for the officers er the cavalry is not told. Ocrtain it is they shot down three of the fomuer and none of the latter. Whel the other oflicers found themselves thus betwecn two firea they galloped out and joined the Europeans, anid made them turtn their guns on $iikhs anll cavalry alike, until these two gallant regi3nents found out their mistake, and once nmo.r turned their fire on the ::-,th. Was not this a nice battle 7 The SumU total was that the :17th were utterly smashed, and tho Sikhs and cavalry frightened out of their wits, and made sensible that they wero mistaken. Many cf the oflicers are furious, andl suay we havo been shedding innocent blood, sa:d tho whole thinig was a blunder. liut the cavalry fired at a party of ladies who were going in their carriages to the Mint, atid wsould certainly have niurdered them if they had not been beaten oil by a small force of l.uropean3. So miuch for the battle. I found everybody at the Millt, -hich several had only reached after manv adventures, and we bivouacked ini the large rooms, and slept on the roof-ladies, children, ayas, anid punkah coolies ; otficers lying dovn dressed, and tileir wives sitting up by them fanning thoiu ; gentleonei, in the a. at fearless 'ibm/m((. ICt/c, sleepillg surrounded hy ladies. In the collmpound or enclosure below there is a little hanidfful if EuropeansPerhaps 150 altogether; others are at the barracks half a- mile off. Thlere is a large collection of cam riages and horses, little bedsteads all over thme place, and twi, circular q1uick hedges, wvith flower gardens iniside, are falling victil,is to the sheep andi goats which have been brought in to provision the place; add to this a heap of niore heer boxes than your 3.ngli.h imnagination can takc in, a"id throw over all the strong bla,ck and white of a full m'oo1nlight, and you have the .ulit as it looked when the Eniglish of ienares had sought refuge in it. There was a piclkllicky, gypsified lhwk about the whole aifAir. wvhich prevented onle realizirg that the smiall congregation srcro there ulaking a stind for a huge enwire, and th.at their lives were ulon th0 toss-uj, of the next events. On Saturday, Sunday, all Monday our fears diminiehed prm9grcssiv1ly, and we ve,t-uwd osit more and more. Yesterd;:y morning news canle that Allaliabad had mutimiied, and all who were riot in the f. rt a-ere lnurd,.red, including I0 oflicers. l)h for lily frieil s in Allahabad Mirzapore is sald to be fighting; ai(i ,,h ir ll.y frienwif in Mirzaporo ! Thiq is mimy cry, asd this is the cry svh,h:f is goinig up all over Indiia and will be echoed at hoel,e in half the families in England ; but, insteadl if frienids, the word will be, my son, or mny brotlier, or mliy lhue,,zid, arid, weorse still, my sister or my wife ! But do n-. tlhink that people as a rule are showing sad face3. The E:lnli,h here arc so essentially peopule of action that they are kept cheerful by it, an,d you sce amriong thcl,n no griti ice, ilo affectation of sorrow. It is a tijiie like this you shwuuld take to judge of the ITndian English, and then you it,iy l.e proud of them. Satlirday, -June 1:1.-Since I lhft off there has been a U,cceWFion c,f reports froin the differnnt s-ations, but the postal cOMunUdiraCiong ale cut off thii side of Allahabad. Atthe lattbr place tho European cupiiiinitity liave taken refuge in tlb fort, where they are satid to be slfficiently uncomforta'-le. The day Of the outbreak there was very bad; 14 officers were sitting at m10ess, 12 of themi were killed on the spot, all the Englihs who hail lit already taken refuge in the fort were killed, and some with tortures not o be related. The telegraph wire is cuet, and aill boats lelsed by the rebels, and the bridge of boats cat down; all above Allahabad is unknown. Whether the English have taken Delhi or not in uncertain. About Cawnpore and Agra we know nothing; there are Europeaa troops enough tbere to cut the natives up, and that is our trust. It issa4i they are short of provkbw in thb fotrt of 4i's4.7l5Ad so rp are sending them, per steamer, loads of English troops, with whom they can walk out aud get soeie sheep anld things. At Lawnpoor, some 36 muiles north of this, they came badly off; we were much interested in them as Mrs. P-, our late Chunar bride, was there with her husband. The first news they had of the outbreak was of the post being stopped on Friday, the 5th; then soume indigo planters came riding in, and said that rhe 37th were close at hand, whereupon they all went to the cutcherry, or collector's office. The 2d company of hjikbs, stationed there, swore to defend them to the last dr,rop of their blood, and, as tbey walked into the cutcherry, one of tlhe blackguards shot Captain O'Mara through the back. They took him in ard shut the doors, and laid him down on the fdoor, while the Sikhs kept firing in above their heads, and another party of them seized the treasure (some 25,0001.) andj walked off with it ; then the Eniglish came oat, left poor O'M&ar dying, and got into their carriages and drove away. They had to leave the Benares road as the 13th Cavalry were coming along it, and they kept knocking about the country till Tuesday, when a party from here fetched them in. Of course, during these four days they underwent great hardships and were in perpetual danger of their lives, so you may fancy how welcome the English cheers sounded in their ears. Cobbidge, the magistrate, was killed by a Sikh; and Airs. O'Mara died of apoplexy, but the rest of the party got in safe. Last Thursday we had another party of fugitives; they had gone on board a steamaer at Mirzapore, and had been taken too near Allahabad, when tlhe flat which was in tow of the steamer struck on a sandbank, and the steamer hav ing business at the fort left the passengers on board the flat, and went off alone; of course, the flat was immediately attacked by natives, and the English had to cut in the boats. They actuaDly sailed down to near Mirzapore before they were caulght by the steamer. The Mirsapore people all ran down to Chunar, but apparently without sufricient alarm, so they were ordered back by Governnient to their duty. Several of our railway bungalows were burnini, and in some cases the owners had to run fast for their lives. My bungalow is, I believe, lnharmed, its proximity to the fort may have saved it ; any how I had all the furniture brought out, so all I can lose is the roof and the doors. This is all I have to say concerning this umost wonderful rebellion. You see within the last month we have lost the whole of the NorthWest, and we shall be happy indeed if another month passes without Lower Bengal following. The moment our protection is withdrawn the villagers plunder and burn one another's houses, and the country which has taken us 100 years to bring into order and cultivation, becomes a desert in one night. It is said the mutineers are collecting at Oude, and forming an army which may possibly drive us out of Benares. No news of Alfred of course. He is the other side of the break in the mails, so there is no chance of hearing from him yet, bot he is in the i,,idst of an English army and safe enough. As for me, I continue in Benares with the family of which I consider niyself a member, and make one of the fanmily garrison, and, as they are people of peace and rather ignoranit in the matter of firearms, I am able to make miyself of soine use. We have four muiskets with bayonets, and feel very strong, and, as Mlark Taply would say, we are remarkably jolly tinder the circumstances. Benares for the moment shows no signs of being in rebellion; the city is quiet, the shops open, and we drive and ride about the statiozi as if nothing was the matter. Very pleasant; but how long will it last? In the meantime the river is rising fast, and European troops coming in daily.",A The subjoined letter from a CGerman residing in Calcutta is contained in the last number of the Augslb9rg Gazo-tte:- " CALCUTTA, JUNE 17. "The troops have been on the point of inutinying here, and the inhabitants of the city are in a terrible fright. At the outbreak of the revolution the Euiropeans (foreigners) offered their services, but they were declined, and that almost cortemptuously. Many persons were, however, much alarmied, and took revolvers with them when they went to church and to balls. The Government consldered it advisable to coax the rebels, and when the 70th Regiment, lying at Barrack pore-a few miles from this city -offered to march against their comorades, the Governor went in person to thank it. When it was decided that the regiment should begin its march it became evident that its professed loyalty was a mere mask. At 3 o'clock during the night between the l3th and 14th inst. we were suddenly awakened, and informed that the outbreak was about to take place. A messenger who had fallen into the hands of the authorities had confessed that the two regi. ments at Barrackpore and the troops in Calcutta had agreed to mutiny during the night in question. The commander of the city sent about everywhere and had the people roused. The expression of people's faces was a sight worth seeing. Dr. George von Liebig, who was armed to the teetb, called us up, and out we sallied, clothed and armed in a sufficiently picturosquo manner. The heroes in our quarter of tho city were few, and only 11 men 'offered their breasts to the cool morning breeze.' As the sun rose our apprehensions diminished, but stil many gentlemen were in despair that only womnen and children were admitted into the fort. Naturally the most alarming reports were in circula. tion. There was a very warlike movement in Calcutta on the Il4th of June (a Sunday.) We fetched a whole cartload of muskets, formed guard, and did what we thought was for the best, as the attention of Government was en. tirely occupied by the troops. In the course of the afternoon the European soldiers had disarnned all the Sepoys. The former would gladly have had anl excuse for having re. course to more stringent measures, for they were greatly excited against the natives. The whole affair, however, went off peaceably, and tho Sepoys mounted guard with ramrods instead of guns. During the night of the 14th aU the Europeans were in movement. We patroUed the streets from 1 till 5 in the morning ; we stopped every native, and if he had arms about him he was put into prison (cr siusste ins loch). In the meantime the Goversinient troops had laid hands on the King of Lucknow (Oude) aiid on a Prince of Delhi, who was with him. Both of them have had quarters given thejii in the fort, and many doorkeepers. On Monday (the 15th) all was quiet, hut during the night mpany people were arrested. Ve agtain took up arnms, and were so fortuiate as to capture some hpolitical fugitives. I have become a soldier, as you see, but shall he heartily glad when 1 can lay aside soy musket. Bisiness is quite at a standstill. The coinstruction of the railroad is discontinued. The railroad cor'pany suffers terribly; all the engineers are dispersed, and a prodigious qjuantity of ismasIsiel Is lost. Government will have to pay an enormous irndemnification to the sufierers. The price of provisions rises from day to day, and rice costs juist twice as much as it did a week ago. I believe that all daiiger is over here, but things look very ugly up the coumitry, and order will hardly be restored before the winter is atan end. If the troops intended for China should come here it will be agreat pieco of good fortune, for if they sbould not the in. surgents will be able to hold their own. 'rerrible atrocities have been committed, and when the English soldiers get alongside of the rascals little mercy will he shown. At Ghazee whole platoons of rebels fell on their knees, ' butthe soldiers were deaf to the voices of their oflicers and not a Sepoy was left alive.' "

iSUMMEB ASSIZES. TTOMV. (.TnRrTP CROYDON, AUGUST 8. (Before the LORD CO BAROT and a Special Jury.) EDWARDS V. BULL&?r. This was an action for assault. Mr. E. James, Q.C., Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Needham 'were for the plaintiff; Serjeant Shee, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Worsley appeared. for the deendant. Mr. EDWL-N JAmES, in opening the case to the jury, said it was one that would require the r very serious attention. The plaintiff complained of a most violent assault having been committed upon him, and when they had heard all the facts of the case, and had hoard what circumstanceS weretobeurged in paUliatloubythedefendant (andheshould not shrink from laying the whole of the facts before them), they would have to say whether the defendant had not committed a most cowardly and unmanly assault upon the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff was entitled to exemplary damages for the affront and Injury he had sustained. He then proceeded to give a brief outline of the circumstances under which the action was brought, and it appeared that the plaintiff, hMr. Edwards, caaries on the business of an insurance broker in partnership with a gentleman named Pittman, and the defendant is engaged in the same occupation in partnership with a gentleman named Hancock, and they are all members of Lloyd's; and it appeared that up to the time of the com. mencement of these proceedings both firms had business transactions together, and were on intimate terms. The wife of the defendant had, it appeared, shortly before the month of June in the present year gone on a voyage to Quebec by tho advice of the physician who had been in attendance upon her for a serious illness. On the 17th of June Mr. Pittman went on a visit to a gentleman named Wilson who resides at Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, and during the visit Mr. Wilson made a comnmunication to Mr. Pittman upon the subject of the defendant's domestio affairs, and particularly in reference to the journey of his wife to Amezica, which was certainly of a very offensive cbaracter, and Al r. Pittman, upon his return to town, told the plaintiff what he had heard, and said that he should in cousequncoo decline to do any more business with the defendant, and he directed the plaintiff to close the account. The plaintiff was unwilling to do this for the sake of all parties, as their business appeared to be mntutally rofitable, without making inquiry and aseertaining whether the statements respecting the defendant were true or not, and he accordingly, a day or two afterwards, spoketo a gentleman named Beddome, also a member of Lloyd's, and whom he knew to be intimately acquainted with the defendant, upon the subject, and informed him of what his partner had told him in reference to the defendant and his wife. The only object the plaintiff had in doing this, according to the statement of his learned counsel, was that the business transactions between them might not be broken off without some explanation, and solely from a kind feeling; but it appeared that Mr. Beddome at once communicated to the defendant what had been stated by the plaintif£ and on the 24th of June he sent a message for him to come to his counting-hoase, and upon his going in his partner, Mr. Hancock, shut the door, and the defendant then, without giving him any opportunity of explanation, laid hold of him and beat him in a most violent manner for several minutes with a stick. This was the assault complained of, and for which the present action was brought against the defendant. Mr. Alfred Edwards, the plaintiff, a young man apparently about four and five and twenty, was then examined. He deposed that he carried on the business of a.n insurance broker with his partner, Mr. Pittman. The defendant also carried on the same business with Mr. Hancock, and the two firms used to have transactions together to a considerable extent. He remembered Mr. Pittman going to visit a gentleman named Wilson, at Broxbourne, on the 17th of June, and upon his return he made a communication to him relating to Mr. Bullen and his wife, in consequence of which he directed that the account between them should be closed. Before doing this he thought it would be right to speak to a friend of the defendant's to ascertain whether the statements were true, and he accordingly communicated with a gentleman named Beddome, but he told him that he did so in strict confidence, and his only object was to induce his partner to go on with the account. The conversation with Ar. Beddome took place on the 22d of June, and when he left him he said, Mind, this goes no further." On the 24th, as he was sitting in his counting-house, a paper was brought to him, on which there was written, in the handwriting of the defendant,- "Mr. Bullen will be oblged by MTr. Edwards cal'lsg o, hbim this Afternoon at his counting-house. N.B. To save a scene at Lloyd's. 11 He accordingly went to the defendant's counting-house about a quarter past 2 o'clock, and he was shown into an inner room, where he found the defendant and his partner, and when he entered the room Mr. Hancock closed the door. The defendant then said to him, "I tnderstand you have been spreading a report about my wife going to America." Witness laid hold of a chair and said, "Will you allow me to sit down for a moment and give an explanation of what I have heard and vhat I have said7" The defendant snatched the chair from him and said he did not want anything of that sort, and then held up a stick and asked if he knew what he had bought it for. Witness told him he did not, and the defendant then asked him who had told him anything about " it," or about "her." WitneEs replied that he had heard it from his partner, who had heard it from Mr. Wilson, of Broxbourne. The defendant then again asked him if he knew what he had bought the stick for, and then suddenly sei7ed him by the collar and began to beat him with the stick over the arms, back, and legs. While he was beating him he repeatedly said, '"Did you not spread it ?" meaning, he supposed, the report, and he replied that he did not. He made use of several oaths while he was beating him, and repeatedly said that he would kill him for twopence. While aU this was going on the defendant's partner continued sitting on the chair, and did not interfere. The defendant continued beating him for five or ten minutes, and he reoeived altogether 12 or 14 blows. He went immediately to Lloyd's and saw his partner, and informed him what had happened, and in the same afternoon the defendant cause to Lloyd's and pulled a broken stick from under his coat, and said that if he did not get a letter of apology he should have to buy a thioker stick. His partner asked him what was the matter, and Le replied, "Oh Edwards will tell you." The stick used by the defendant was a thick cane. Cross-examined by Serjeant SIIEE.-Witness had been in business as an insurance broker for about a year, in partnership with Mr. Pittman. His partner was five or six years older than himself. He had been acquainted with the defendant five or six years. He was about 26 or 27 years old, and his firm did a very large business. They were perfectly good friends before this took place. He did not say to Mr. Beddome " Oh, Bullen is of no use, he is troubled with a bad wife, he has sent her to Quebec to get rid of her; she is a stale piece, and he says so himself." Would swear he did not say this. Mr. Pittman, his partner, was a very strict man in his ideas. What he did say to Mr. Beddome was, "Do you know whether it is true that Bellen has sent his wife to America to get rid of her ?" He replied, " What is that to you?" Witness told him it was notlhing to him, but he thought it was calcu. lated to injure Bullen if such a report was spread at Lloyd's. Mr. Beddome then asked him where he had heard it, and he said his partner had told him, and he then saidthat any one who knew Mrs. Bullen knew the reason she had gone to America. Witness then asked Mr. Beddome whether he thought it was likely that Mr. Bu]len should have spoken of his wife as a "stale pie of Serjeant SHxE. -And we are to understand you said all this n a kind and conciliatory tone, as a person interested in the honour and credit of the deferdant? Witness.-You may put what construction you please upon it, but that was my intention. Cross-examination continued.-Mr. Beddome said he did not believe it. Witness's partRer told hisi that he had heard that MIr. Bullen had married a very respectable voung lady, and that shortly after the niarriage he had taken home to his wife a child he had had by some otlier woman, and that he had now got tired of his wife and had sent her to America, and had since been living with other women. He also said something about Mr. Bullen having stated that his wife was a " cold" piece, but he modified that expression to " stale" piece when he spoko to Mr. Beddome. Serjeant SIIEE.-And you did all this out of pure kindness and consideration f or the defendant? Witness.-I had no other object than to get a contradiction of the report in order that our account might go on with the defendant. Re-examined.-He did not say one word more to Mr. Beddome than he had heard from his partner, and the whole communication was strictly confidentiaL Mr. G. F. Pittman, the plaintiff's partner, was then called to prove that he had comusunicated to him what Mr. Wilson told him, and that he also directed him to close the account with the defendant, in consequence of what he heard respecting the defendant's conduct to his wife. He said he did not take the step entirely on that account, but there were other reasons for his doing so. Serjeant SI1EE then made a most eloquent speech to the jury on behalf of the defendant. He said, that although in many instances actions of the present character were very easily disposed of, there were cases in which a man committed an assault under the isiluence of the most gross insult and provocation, where the law did not enor - h an eed,ad ecud nyreyuo afford him any remedy, and ho could onaly rely upon the good sense and discrimination of a special jury composed of gentlemen of honourable and manly feeling, and who would to a certain extent cure the defect in the law, when they were called upon to give damages in such a cmse, and return a verdict in accordance with the real merits. He admitted that the defendant had committed an assauit, and the plaintiff was therefore entitled to a verdict, but he said that when the jury looked at all the facts of the case he thought they would have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff had brought it entirely upon himself by the nmalicioss slanders he had been the means of promulgating against the wife of the defendant, and for which the defendant had no legal remedy, and was consequently obliged to take the mode of redress into his own hands, and he submitted that, under such circumstances, although the Jury might be compelled to give a verdict for the plaintiff, they would, at the same time, think that the sissallest coin of the realm would be an ample amount of damages to be given in such a case. The learned serjeaut then proceeded to state that the wife of the defesidant was a most respectable and virtuous young lady, and they had lived on the happiest terms together. During the last two years, however, she had been seriously ill, and the voyage to America that had been referred to was only taken at the solicitation of the physicians who attended upon her, who looked upon it as the only chance of saving her life. With regard to the otlher statement, that an illegitimate child of the defendant had been brought up with his own children, hs admitted it was true, but he urged that the plaintiff had no right to interfere with such a matter, and that he had brought the assault upon himself by his own improper interference in the domestid affairs of the defendent, and the scandals he had circulated respecting him and his wife, Mr. E. 33, ,eddome wa galed 8 a witness for the defendant, and he stated that on the 22d of June the plain. tiff came up to him in Lloyd's and said, "Sot hear that BuDenhasa troublesomewife, and that he has sent her to Quebec to get rid of her. I have heard it said that he has alk4 hinsPlf called her a 'stale piece."' le uttered this in different sentences, and witness had only time to say between them, " What Is that to you P" The plaintiff then said that Mrs. Bullen could not be much from the fact of her having a ehild living with her that had been born before Mr. Bullen was married. The witness eaid that Mr. Edwards made the statements as he considered in an offensive manner, and certainly not in a tone of regret, and he felt it right to ask the advice of an older member of Lloyd's than himself, and by his advice the matter was communicated to the defendant. In cross-examination the witness swore that Mr. Edwards did not say to him at the close of the conversation, " Mind, this goes no further," or that he informed him that his partner had heard of the statements referred to, and wished to know wbether they were true. The LoRiD CmxT BIROIT, in summing up the case, said he owned that it appeared to him that the business of insurance might be carried on in the city of London without an inquiry into the domestio affairs of the parties who wished to effect such business; and he mast say that he thought a barrister would be as much entitled to inquire into the private character of a client before he accepted a brief from him as Mr. Pittman had to go into the private domestic arrangements of the defendant. He then proceeded to state that the question for the jury was whether there bad been sufficient provocation given by the plaintiff to justify them ln giving nominal damages, and he was bound to inform tbem that whatever might have been the character of the communication made by the plaintiff to Mr. Beddome, or the object of that communication, the conduct of the defendant in sending for him to his office, and committing this fviolent assault upon him witbout giving him the slightest opportunity of explanation, was most unjustifiable, and contrary to law. The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict for the plaintif amages, 2601. Neither of the courts wiU sit this morning (Monday) until 11 o'clock, and the Lord Chief Baron will then go on trying special jury causes, and the whole of the common jury causes that remain will I e disposed of before MWr. Justice
VN)pll4Tl.lDX('N oTm LANCASTER. ATUGU.ST 8. CROWN CouTRT.-(Befrse Afr. Baron WArSon'.) Edward Hardman, aged 28, shoemaker, was indicted for the Wilful murder of Bllen Hardman, his wife, at Chorley, on the 5th of March last. Mr. Monk, Q.C., Mr. A. Crosse, and Mr. Alison prose. outed; Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Brett defended the prisoner. Mr. MONsK;, In stating the case to the jury, said it was unnecessary for him, in a charge so zerious against the pri. soner as that of having taken the life of his own wife, to request the careful and discriminating attention of the jury. The prisoner was a shoemaker residing at Chorley, and had been married to the deceased woman about two years and two months. That union had not been a happy one. The prisoner and his wife were of different religious creeds, and that element of discord had produced the ordinary consequences. He only referred to this as one source of dissa tisfaction on the part of the prisoner with his wife, she having promised him that she would leave the Church of England, of which she was a member, and adopt the tenets of the Church of Rome. After their marriage this and other sources of difference produced a separation, and in three months after their marriage she returned to her father's house. After a time he sent for her back again, and she agreed to return and live with him; and the latter part of their married life had certainly not been distinguished by the differences which had rendered the former part of it so nhappy. On Shrove Tuesday the deceased woman was taken ill, and on the 5th of March, in the following week, she died. She had been attended throughout her illness by Dr. Smith. At this time the prisoner lived at a place called Botany Bay, a hamlet of Chorley. Ou the afternoon of Shrove Tzuesday the prisoner was in the house of a man named Darwin, a beerhouse-keeper, when his wife passed on her way from Chorle~, and shook her fist at him. Darwin, seeig t, said to the prisoner, " What is the matter? You had better be off." The prisoner went away, and returned in half an hour, saying his wife had been supping some broth at home, that it had made her ill, and that hehad vomited and was muck purged. In the course of that day he told another witness that he had " warmed some broth for her." Two days before some broth had been made by a neighbour named Rothwell, wbo had borrowed a pan to make it in from the deceased, and in return he had Eent her some of the broth, which was made of meat and vegetables. Rothwell's family partook of this broth without any ill effects from it, and so did the deceased on the Monday, and put away some that remained, which she took on Shrove Tuesday, on her return from Chorley, where she had been. The next day (Wednesday) the prisoner wrote to his father-in-law that his wife was taken very ill, and on Thursday he went for Dr. Smith, who attended her. The prisonertold Dr. Smith that shewassuffering fromabowel oomplaint, and unless there was a change she could not live long. hedeceasedwomanwasahealthy,robust woman,wellformed and muscular. The prisoner wrote again to his father-inlaw describing his wife as vomiting and very ill, and the baby as being also ilL His wife had been confined in the previous October. Her father came over to see her. She complained of her illness, and said she thought she should like a little wine, and her father bought her some blackberry. wine, of which she partook. Her father remained with her all day, and she was a little better on the Thursday night. At this time the prsoner and his wife were on terms of courtesy, but not of affection. Her father again saw her and spent some time with her, giving her some toast-and. water, and she continued to get better while her father was with her, b'ut when left to the care of her husband she again got worse. On Sunday, the 1st of March, she was decidedly improved in health, and was able to eat meat and potatoes, and retaineethisfoodonherstomach. OnMonday, the 2dof March, she still continuedto improve. On Tuesday, the 3dofMarch,theprisonerwenttoDr. Smith, and gotsome mixture and some powders for her, and told Dr. Smith she was much better, and only wanted to get up her strength. On this day the prisoner met a woman named Tonfield, and to her he described his wife as exceedlngly ill, and told her to call and tell deceased's father that she was a deal worse, and had begun to be so that morning, as soon as she got her breakfast; thatshe had then begun to vomit, and he thought it would be a job ior her this time. The vomit of the deceased was of anextremely yellow appearance, and the surgeons would state that antimony would have a great tendency to produce that appearance by increasing the secretion of bile. In the course of this Tuesday the prisoner purchased for his wife a quantity of buttermilk from a person named Derbyshire. They would hear that Derbyshire's family partook of this same buttermilk, and that it was perfectly harmless. This buttermilk the prisoner had divided, and had placed a part of it in a jug for his wife. A neighbour came in and tasted it, and thought it had a very peculiar taste of soap or alum, and askedthe prisoner what he had putinit? He said nothing, tasted it, and said it was very bad, and threw it into the ashes. On Thursday, the 5th, the deceased continued ill, and was extremely purged and vomited; she became much exhausted, and got worse and worse tll she died. She appeared blask under the eyes, she had a dewy, clammy skin, aching of the limbs and was blue and cold at the extremities. Dr. Smith, her medical attendant, attributed her death to gcstro ent-er-is, or inflammation of the bowels. She was buried, and after her funeral remarks prejudicial to the prisoner began to be made; inquiries were instituted, and ultlmately the body was exhumed 11 days after burial, and a post orerle examination and inquest were held. It was found that the body gave out no offensive odour an unusual circumstance where death arises from naturai causes. This is a peculiarity known to be the effect of poisoning by arsenic or antimony. The stomach on being examined presented bright red patches, as also the duodenum and rectum. In the case of death from an irritant poison this would be likely to be the case, as the poisoned contents of the stomach were retained by the mechanical formation of these viscera longer in them than in other parts of the bowels. The oasophagus was also ia a state of inflamation, which they would hear was an indication of the administration of an irritant poison. A careful analysis of the contents of the stomach was made by a gentleman named Watson, an analytical chymnist of celebrity, who resided at Bolton, and he found in all the parts of the intestines which were subjected by him to chymical tests traces of antimony, an unquestionable poison, and also slight traces (f arsenic. The amount found was not great,-from one-half to three-quarters of a grain of antimony, and about the 2(0th part of a grain of arsenic. Some, hovever, would have passed away with the vomiting and purging; and that found would be no indication of the amount taken. All the medical men were of opinion that this woman came by her death from antimony or arsenic, or both combined. If she died by poison, by whom had it been administered? This inquiry was of most grave importance. At an earlier date than this, some months before, the prisoner was found to be possessed of tartar emetic, which was only another name for tartarised antimony; and he was also aware of its qualities. A person named Neald came to him and complained that he was ill, and wanted a dose of medicineto purge him. The prisoner told him hecould give him something which would work him, and he mixed in a glass of beer some powder which he had in a paper, which he handed toNeald. Neald took it, and it did work him, making him purge and vomit. In February he purchased a drachm, or 60 grains, of tartar emetic, from a chymist named Gorman, which he said he wanted so give to a horse. This was a poison used only for medical purposes. Arsenic was a poison of another character; it was used extensively in manufactures, and necessary to be sold. Shortly before his wife's illness the prisoner went to Preston, and at the shop of a Mr. Chrichley, a chymist, he bought half a pound of arenic, which he represented that he wanted to kill bugs. Thechymist wanted a reference to some person he knew, and asked him if he did not know a leatherdresser in the town, he representing himself as a shoemaker. He said he did not, and gave an untrue account of this, as he dealt with oneof the leatherdressers in the town, and owed money to him. He also gave a wrong address. The arsenic was sapplied to him coloured with indigo. Afterwards, when asked what he had done with it, he said he had broken the parcel in his pocket and thrown it away, as he did not like it loose in his pocket. On the Tuesday, when he went to Dr. Smith for the powders for his wife, he brought them back tied up with string. The witnesses who a3ministered these powders would teU them they were white. Dr. Smith did not tiup the powders with string, and the powders he sent were gray. A woman waiting on the deceased tasted one of these powders, and it produced a burning unpleasant taste in ner mouth. A woman cleaning the house, two days after the death of his wife, had thrown the last of those powdersaway. The prisoner saw her find a paper with some white powder in it; he sprang up and said, " Give it to me, it is poison. After the burial the prisoner went into the house of a neighbour, and mid it was very fortunate the police had not found this paper when they starched Mis house, as it contained poison. Three days afterwards he went to the police office and said some persons had been raising scandalous reports about him, and he 'wished to know whatIt was all about. The policeman told 1dm he had not behaved well to his wife, and people would to speak of it. The prisoner said, when they lived at B'rinde, shortly After their marriame, they did not ive appily together, but since they had Tived at Botany they had been as happy as most couples. This would be fhovn not tohbe true On onfoccasucn she wesdlsen to be cryigad he called her "a great blubberi evil" and said tt ther blubbering made phleoo thnh did not treat her well." In the gaon At ai' rston he stated to a prisoner that he had received tt a o from varis burial clubs on account of his wife's fneral, and "that if head let er live two months moro he should have got 81. more." As A, mo tive for the commission of such a dreadful crime he had already stated that differences of religious creed had rendered their union an unhappy one. They had quarreled as to the faith in which their child shonul be brought up. More than once the prisoner had alluded to aother wompun and had stated that that woman should soon be his wife. After his wife's death he had sent a message to a woman named Sherrington, asking her to come and see him, and t elling her she had nothing to do but to comne and hang her bonnet up in his house, and that if she did not choose to come there was Another ready who would. These were the facts and circumstances on which, on behalf of the prosecution, the learned counsel asked the jury to come to the conclusion that the prisoner was guelty of the crime impurted tof thim aitd,tthesenbeinghfor the pmostdparteproved, the case for deathe proseutionwas cloaturevaspaed ah Cr hadrneds ate csis Lonse took hircseataonthel benc,*ndh this morning at so'clock, aond,dtherprisoner having bn esplaced at the bar, thectrifallwa resumed. I a oB uyt hwts h Mfr. OVMxND rose to make his address to the jury on the part of the prisoner. Ile said he deeply felt the importance of the situation in which he was placed, seeing that the life or death of a fellow creature was placed in his hands. The cbue was one of circumstantial evidence, and that was by some considered to be, when fully established, the most per fect of all evidence. It was not his duxty to show that the prisonier was innocent; it was the duty of the prosecution to prove that he was guilty. The prosecution must prove that not only was poison found in the body of the deceased, but that the unfortunate woman had died of it. But, though poison had been found in the body, it had to be proved beyond doubt that that poison had been administered by the prisoner. He would admit-and he must admit, although it might appear prejudicial to his elient, that both arsenic and antimony had been found in the body. The most eminent man of the day had been brought forward, and his opinion upon a hypothetical case was that the deceased had dled fromtthe effects of antimony. But what was the amount of poison found 9 Only from half to three quarters of a grain of antimony, and the 200th part of a grain of arsenic. And though the poison was found there was no evidence thst the prisoner had administered It, and he trusted to be able to show that he had not administered it. He thought the prosecution had Abandoned the idea of the deceased having been poisoned by arsenic, and the question would now be, did she die of antimony, and was that administered In one dose or more ? The learned counsel then repeated the circumstances of the illness of the deceased, and said it would be for then. to be satisfied that nore than one dose of antimony had been administered. Her illness was treated by Dr. Smith as gastro-enteritis, or linflammation of the stomach and bowels, wvhich might arise from natural causes, and the treatment and the way in which her health had improved forbade the assumption that' there had been any attack from the Tuesday to the Tuesday following, when she had some mussels, buttermilk, blackberry wine, and other things improper for a person in her state of health, got worse. and on he Tursdayshe died. He should account for the poison, and show that, though her death might be attributable to poison, it might have been administered by mistake and without any murderous intention. The woman had lately been confined, had gone to Chorley, caught cold, and had got some broth; and the prisoner on her being taken ill had gone to a neighbour's apd told her it was the broth; and had still stuck to that As the cause of her illness, and that was the strongest possible proof of his innocence, as had he been guilty he would not have mentioned the broth if he had placed poison In it as suggested. Buttermilk had been assigned as the cause of her Ilness, but there was no proof that the prisoner touohed it, and even the contradictory evidence as to the taste was proof that there was no gson in it. The next thing was the powders sent 'y , Smith, and It was said that the prisoner had, instead of those, substituted powders of his own. There was no evidence of it. Dr. Smith admitted that hewas in a hurry, and that the bottle containing tartar emetic stood immediately over that containing Dover powvder, and it wa3 probable that a mistake was made by Dr. Smith in taking down the wrong bottle. And if that mistake were made, then the whole of the woman's 1!nes8 and the discovery of poison in her body after death was fully accounted for, and he should with confidence look forward to their verdict in his favour. He submitted that if the prisoner had changed the powders, he would never have left the third powder on the table from Thursday to Saturday. The act would be that of a madman. The learnedcounsel then reviewed the conduct of the risoner, and dwelt strongly on his calling in so many of the neighbours during her illness, and he implored them to review his conduct both before and during the illness of his wife, and say whether it was the conduct of a guilty man or not. It was said that he had received money from funeral clubs; but from the nature of the funeral he must have been a loser rather than gainer; and then, when the rumours got abroad relative to his character, he went boldly to the police-office and challenged inquiry. That the prisoner had been in the possession of tartar emetic he would not deny; he had openly paraded it, and administered it to Neild in the presence of Bradsworth. He had bought 60 grains in February, and that had been found by the girl Bolton after his wife's death, and he told her it was poison. The learned counsel then went into an analysis of the various parts of the evidence, contending that they would tend to exculpate the prisoner. He (Mr. Overend) had shown that he had been in possession of tartar emetic, oxali acid, and arsenic, and explained them alL The buttermilk had never reached her, tbe broth had never been touched by the prisoner, and he had shown that, according to medical testimony, her ilness was the result of natural causes. It had been said that the prlsoner and his wife did not live happily together, but there ad been no evidence of any unkindness at Botany Bay, and the only evidence on thatpoint was that about two years ago they quarrelled, when residing at Brindle; and as to the other motive, that he wanted to have another woman, in the Crown and Anchor a lot of rough people were joking him, and he said he should not be long before he got married again. As to the other point, reluigous disputation, the evidence only shows that he had said she had promised to turn to his religion and had not done so; and he had said he would bring up her child in his own way. They had never once quarrelled on the subj ~ct. The learned counsel conclud a lengthy and forcible address by entreating a calm consideration of the case, and urging that if his statements were correct, they would be relieved from the painful duty of finding the prisoner guiltr. His LoDSHInP said in this case the jury had two things to consider, whether the deceased died from the effects of poison, and, if so, was the prisoner the person who administered it. As to the first proposition, his Lordship went over the evidence ofthe medical men, tending to show conclusively that the deceased had died of poison, and then proceeded with the other evidence adduced by the prosecution to show that the prisoner was the person who administered it. In coming to a conclusion on the latter point they would have to look at the way in which they lived, together by themselves, with only a little girl coming to nurse occasionaLy. Was she likely to have committed suicide? Was the prisoner in possession of poison? And was that poison administered by a person in the house ? The jury were locked up, and at the expiration of about 20 minutes returned intoocourt with a verdict of Guilty of wilful murder. His LoRDsHip, having put on the black cap, proceeded to pass sentence upon the prieoner. He said,-Edward Hardman, you have been convicted after a fuli and'painful investigation of the crime of wilful murder-of the murder of your own wife-a murder committed under circumstances of the most painful kind. I quite concur in the verdict of the jury. It is impossible for me to hold out any hope of escape from the full punishment of the law, and I advise you most earnestly and solemnly to apply yourself to the spiritual consolation which will be afforded you. Your days are numbered, and I would entreat you earnestly to throw yourself before the throne of grace, where there is mercy for every sinner that repenteth. will not aggravate your feelings at the present moment, but proceed to pass upon you the sentence of the law, which is that you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck until you are dead, when your body is to be taken down, and buried within the precincts of the gaol where you have been confined previous to your conviction, and may the Lord have mercy on your soul! The prsoner, who slightly trembled, and had turned very pale, was then removed from the dock. E[is Lordship was deeplyaffected during the passing of the sentence. Mr. Baron Watson proceeded this afternoon to open the commission at LiverpooL Mr. Baron CUAyNELL was occupied trying causes till ' o'clock, and then adjourned, having still three causes to try on Monday. His Lordship cannot, therefore, proceed to UIverpool until Monday night.
OXFORD PTRCTTIP GLOCESTEB AT-m.r-X r ClVIL COURT.-(Before MCr. Baron MATrTIN and Common Juries.) D'yLWFART V. M1ARSHIALL. Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Air. W. H. Cooke appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Skinner, Q.C., and Mr. Powell for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, M. D'Elwvart, was a French. man, and teacher of the French language, residing at Cheltenham, and he sued the defendant, Frederick Marshall, an attorney in the same town, to recover damages for slander, imputihg to him that he was " a rogue, and had swindled a lady named Johnson of the sum of 240'." It appeared that a Cheltenham lady named Johnson had become interested in the plaintiff, and had made him divers offers of assistance. To the several plans proposed by the lady for his advancement the plaintiffobjected; buthaving intimatedthat he had a strong desire for agricultural pursuits Mrs. Johnson promised that she would purchase a farm for him. It was rather suggested that the plaintiff himself understood he was to become the proprietor as he had given instructions to the defendant to procure his naturalimtion ; but this po.nt was not cleared up, for thongh the plaintiff and Mrs. ohnson were both in court neither of them was called. The defendant, it appeared, had been employed by Mrs. Johnson to get back a contract and abstract from the plalntiff, and, strongly disapproving the plaintiff's conduct in the matter, he expressed his opinion of him in a very unreserved manner to a Mr. Roberts, on which occasion, according to the evidence, he made use of the slanderous words now complained of. He also repeatedthe same expressions on another occasion. The defendant was called as a witness, and denied having made use of the slanderous words imputed to him ; but he admitted having called the plaintiff a *scoundrel," and that he believed he was a " rogue," though he said he had neTer called him by that name. Considerable amusement was produced in court by the vivacitY of the little Prenchmnan and the pugacions dixpo~ sition of the defendant, who, it appeared, had been bourid over to keep the peace, In consequence of a threat to chastis the plaintiff's attorney, a man named Boodle, who alsw practises at Cheltenham. Mr. Serjeant PIGOTT offered to consent to the withdrawal of a juror, provided the defendant would exkres his regret at having made use of the expreasions complained of. Mr. SKNnR, as lis cient refQsed to accede to this ro. posal, contended that the words had never been spoe, and, if they had, the communication was privileged. Mr. Baron M.ARTIs having summed up the evidence, the jury found for the plaintiff,-Damages, 401. THOMAS V. LEWIS. lr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Dowdewell appeared for the plaintiff- Xr, Skinner, (.C., and Mr. }hipson for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, Evan Thomas,was an elderly man 'who lived at Lampeter, in Cardiganshire, and he sued the defendant, Thomas Lewis, an attorney in the same place, to recover damane8 for negligence as an attorney. The chief ground of complant wsi, that the defendant had ad. vised the plaintiff that he could legally enter into certain agree)ments with an ttorne1 IxIedaoyd, whicb agree. nents brea ofterwar el by the Vice-Chancellor to be bad by reason of * chperty." The defendant denied that he had given the plaintiff any such advice The juMy found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 40. damages, the h leave to move to increase the damages if the Comb should be of opinion that he was entitled to more. CRI1n32A. COURT.-(Bcfore Mr. Baron BBA EwxLL.) John Wilce was charged with forgig and utterna promissory-note for 264 3h., at Woo02 ne, with intent to defraud, onL the let of January, 1857. Mr. Sawyer Appeared for the pr~oetion; Mr. W. H. Cooke defended the prisoner. It appeared the prisoner was a man who gained his livelihood by going about among the farmers in the courtry round the Forest of Dean with steam-thrashin for the purpose of thrashing out their corn, 1nthe year 1854 he was indebted to Mr. Higgins, a farmer, at Wool. Iastone, in the sum of 401. Mr. Hiegins proceedaed against him in the County Court and recovered judgment. In December, 1856, he pressed the prisoner for payment of the amount, and the prisoner suggested that if Mr Higgins would get a joivt and several promissory note for 261. 3s. drawn, he would sign it, and also et the signatures of his uncle and father-in-law. he noto w as accordingly drawn, and was sent some time afterwards by the prisoner to Mr. Higgins. It purnorted to be signed by the prisoner, and also by John Watkins and Thomas Morgan. Two persons named John Watkins and Thomas Morgan said the signatures were not theirs, and they also denied that they had given any authority to any person to put their names to the note. Watkins a'I the prisoner was in the habit of calling him " uncle." Mr. Cooxz having addressed the jury, The prisoner was found Guilty. Mr. Baron BRAMWELL sentenced him to be imprisoned for six months, with hard labour. James Bayliss was charged with embezzling the money of his m oyer, the right hon. Lord Redesdale, at Bourton-on- Mr. Cripps conducted the prosecution; Mr. Powell defended the prisoner. It appeared that Lord Redesdale had for some ears past been combining his important duties in the 11cuse of Lords with farming operations, carried on upon his own property in this county, but apparently with no better success thba is usually said to attend all agricultural operations when the master's eye is withdrawn. The prisoner had for some time been bailiff and had had the entire management of the farm, all receipts aud disbursements passing through his hands, and, in fact, he possessed the entire confidence of Lord Redesdale, to wvhom he accounted at long intervals of time. For a time the smal profits of the farm were attributed only to ordinary defects of skill or mana6ement; but the attention of Lord Redesdale ibeing at length more particularly caUed to the matter, the prisoner had been directed to furnish monthly accounts to a person named by his Lordship for that pur. pose. The fraud was thus very speedily detected, The very firt monthly account purported to show that 80l. had been. received for the sale of four oxen at Moreton fair, while application being made to the dealer, it was discovered that. 75t. had been 4 part paid for five beasts, the real number sold upon that occasion. The clue to the fraud being once given iquiries vwere made, which brought to light a great number of transactions of the same nature, as to which other biUs had been preferred. The com lexity of the accounts extending over a lengthened period had made it, however, difficult to establish those cases, and some of the bills hadbeen ignored by the grand jury; but a clumsy attempt made by the prisoner in this case to alter some figures in his farm-book, so soon as he thought himself discovered, made this case too strong for Mr. POWELL urged upon the jury various topics in the prisoner's favour, and paticularly his long good character and his inability to keep the accounts in the mode required. The jury, however, with very little hesitation, found the prisoner Guilty. Mr. CRIPsPS then said that deficiencies to the extent of about 2001. had been discovered; and Mr. Baron BRAM.LwLL sentenced the prisoner to 18 months' imprisonment, with hard labour.
rO ICE. XIor-NM oRsE.-Mr. Sleigh, the barrister, applied on the part of the Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Company for simmonses to the London General Omnibus Company, calling upon the directors of the latter to answer for the behaviour of their servants i-a preventing passengers from entering or leaving the carriages of the former company. He described the conduct of the defendants as a system of brutal competition, in which there was not a particle of fair play, and as the aonduct of the defendants, by their servants, had become dangerous to the public, it was the intention of the Saloon Omnibus Company to summon every person who violated the A ct, and it w as to be hoped that the magistrates wvould forward the public interest by sentencing every person convicted to imprisonment, as the inlliction of a fine had proved of no effect. The LORD MAYOR granted summonses in five separate WoRsmrP-sTRET.-George Spicer was charged with being concerned with others, who have escaped apprehension, in an attempted garotte robbery. Mr. James Sharpe, a tradesman at Old Ford, stated, that while taking a glass of ale at the bar of a publichonse not far from his own residence, on the preceding evening, the prisoner and two other men eatered and tried to get him into conversation. He tried to keep them at a distance at first, but the prisoner claimed to be either an acquaintance or customer of his, and he at length consented to pay for their having something to drink. To do this he had to pul out his purse, and fancied he saw them notice where he placed hls purse upon receiving his change. He therefore waited in the house some time, when the prisoner and the otner man left together, and after the lanse of a few minutes he left also; but he had scarcely turned away from the door when he heard a footstep, and was immediately gr O pod round the throat by some powerful man behiDd him, who so compressed his windpipe with both hands that he was nearly suffocated. At the same moment the prisoner and a third man came before him, and were proceeding to rob him, when he put out all his strength, and srgled so desperately with his assailants that he succeeded at last in releasing his throat from the first man's grasp and took to his heels as fast as he could run. He was soon, however, overtaken by the men, one of -whom struck hin so violently in the nape of the neck that he fell to the pavement on his hands and knees, and a second attempt was being made to rifle his pockets, when some people fortunately came up and so alarmed the thieves that they left him to recover as best he conld, and started off in different directions. He afterwards gave as accurate a description as he could of his assailants to the police, and the prisoner, whom he could satisfactorily identify from having seen him frequently before loitering about that neighbourhood, was taken in the course of the same night. The prisoner protested his innocence and declared the prosecutor was entirely mistaken in his i dentification, but it was stated that he was well known to the police, and he was committed till that day week for the completion of the evidence. TnAmds.-John Reardon, aged 21, described as a compositor, and John Mackness, 21, who called himself a seaman, of No. 4,tBrown-street, Southwark, but who are in reality notorious river thieves and burglars and most dangerous fellows, were charged with burglarlously breaking and entering the premises of Mr. Richard Jolly, sailmaker and shipehandler, No. 276, High-street, Wapping, and stealing &wt. of copper, wearing apparel, and other pro. perty therefrom. Mr. YARDLEY.-Are the prisoners known? Inspector Bridges.-Yes, Sir. They are both well-known thieves, and have been convicted. Reardon has gone by the name Publey and other names. Mr. YA11DnxY remanded the prisoners for a week.

ELECTION INTELLIGBNBCE. BIRMINGfIHAM, SATtMDAY EVENDING. Mr. V'Gcalby ard ?5ir. Webster have both retired from the contcst, anid Mr. Bright is tnus left in undisturbed posse:sion of the field. At a mleeting of Mr. At'Ceachy's friends held last night, at wihich lMr. Adderley, M.P., was present, it was openly avowed that the only hope of success was founded uipon the division which existed in the Liberal party. To preveist this result .Mr. Webster has withdrawn, union has been accomplished, and the Conservatives defeated. Had all three candidates gone to the poll Air. sla'Geacly would in all probability have been returned. Mr. Bright arrived at Tainworth, where he has taken up his residence for a few days, early this morning, and shortly afterwards, at the request of his committee, issued the following address:- "To l'IE ELEITOItS Ol- Tlt BiOROt0705 OF BtRMaxCr t3.

" I have, therefore, not sought to be rettsrned to Parliainvnt, but have endeavoured to evpde all inivitations to becottie a candidate for the suffrage of any constitnency. "I feel, however, that after the steps which have been takeni by *,y friends its Birtoiingltani I ant not at liberty to reject the honour and the responeibility which they are disposed to olfer to me, and I have intimated to them that while, strictly speakiDg, I am not a casldidato soliciting your sfifrages, I cannot withheld such cooDeration with incus as itoay enablc them best to sustain the position they have taken its reference to the approaching election.

It shows, on comparison wvith preceding statements, that the hepvy expenditure of capital requisite for the completion of their authorized systeaa of railways is being brought to a close. The opening on the 1st of July of the Devises branch, &A miles in lengtb, has cowpleted the whole of the railways the comupany are authorized to make.

The capital account of the Shrewsbury railways shows that 3,427,!J90t. had been raised, incliding 2,450,1291. in stock and shares, 671,57G'. on loan, 247,7201. loans raised for joint purposes, and 58,-5651. oil personal accounts, inclusive of 13,270L. due to Great Western account. The total expenditure on those lines to the 30th of June last amounted to 3,2092-11., and for subheription to StourValley Railway 190,0871., together 3,398,2581., leaving a balance consisting of assets and personal accounts amounting to 29,7011. lhe debenture statement showed that 10,222,7601. had been borrowed to the 30th of June on debentures, of which 4,333,4211. was borrowed at 5 percent., 1,139,7451. at4jt per cent., 3,085,8261. at 4A per cent., 911,5001. at 4. per cent., 8S7,1601. at 4 per cent., 57,2001. at 3i ptr cent., and 623,9071. at 3.- per cent. The revenue account of the Great Western lines for the half-year ending the 30th of June, 1857, showvs that 768,9541. bad been received, including 7,0501. rent from the Bristol and Birmingham Railway and dividends from Glocester trainroad, 12,1701. for use of plant by other companies, 2,9141. interest on revenue cash balanes during the half-year, 6.07:31. rent of Great Western Hotel and other property, and 2231. for registration fees. The expenditure on revenue account amounted to 349 2571., or 4716 per cent., including 1,6711. for Goverinment duty, 15,6521. rates an(d taxes, and 2,5001. for Parliamentary and legal expenses, leaving a balance for the half-year of 419,G'J1. To thie sum is added 17,2781. balance from the preceding accou'it, 2,5721. net balance of Kennet ard Avon (Canal tratfic for the half-year, 5701. profits under South Wales lease for half-year endiug 31st of Decetnber, 185., and 1G,56tsl. dividends on shares held in the South Devon, South Wales, and Dean Forest companies-makicg a total of 4:,G GS41. From this sum is deducted 158?. for additions to works, 20,16SI. for guaranteed annuities to Wilts, Somerset, and Wey. mouth, and the Kennet and Avon Canal proprietors, 15,8321.. renteharges for the half-year, including that of the Glocester aud Dean Forest, Eereford, lBoss, and Glocester and W'yconihe Railways and of the Paddington estate, 5.4221. appropriated againist loss on the lease of the South 'Wales iailway prior to the 30th of Jtune, 1854 (being a moiety of the dividend received this half year), 239,133GI. interest en loans, and 106,1481. for interest on Berks Extension shares anid Great Western Preference stock, and 18,C191. to make updeficienoyof receipts on Shrewsbury lines, leaving a disposable sum of 51,1971. Out of th:is saum the directors recoon mnd a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum, which, on 8,237,2761. of ordinary capital, will absorb 41,1861., and leave a balance of 10,0111. The revenue on the Shrewvsbury linies for the half-year, after deducting 5,65.71. to cover expenditure in respect of traific at Birkenliead and passing over the Birkenhead IRailway, atnounted to 124,338-I. ; and the working expenditure to 74,71)1., leiving a balance of 49,5461. to meet 11, 176?.. the interest paid on debentures, loans, &c., and 4S,98SS., the amount of the half-year'sguaranteed dividends; together, 6S, I1Gf., leaving a deficiency of 18 6191., which is provided by the Great Western Company out of their reveiinue. The decrcase In the dividend froun 21 per cent. at the corresponding period of 18.;G to 1 per cent. in the past halfyear is owing entirely to the whole of the interest on the capital (vvith the ixcepthonof 7,0171.) being charged for the first time agatiist the revenue. The increase in the items of interest on loats and preference shares charged against revenue amounrs to G0,801)0. over that paid for the halt-year ending .1 une, 1836, and is about equivalent to a dividend at the rate of 1.1 ,er cent. per annum on the consolidated stock of the c`m payly. This result was to a great extent anticipated, but it was expected that the profit arising from the increase of tralhic would have the effect of reducing the pressure, and thus increasing the net revenue to meet the heavy charges against it for interest on the capital expended on the new lines as they came into operation. Against tlis expected advantage, howvever, there were the expenses of the additional working and maintenance of 92 miles of new railwayopened in sections, and at vaiiousperiods withlin the space of 12 mnontbs. Notwithstanding the effiorts made by the ofcials the traffic oin these new lines could not be sufficiently develol lto pay all the working expenses, and consequently some di , :ntnent has been experienced ia that respect. Tine ' dlf.1erecluiredtodevelopethetraHhicon new lites, particulail, 'osec passieg through agricultural distriets, but there ca-. --no dotubt, according to the statistics of railway traffic, that the returns on these at present unproductive lines will gradiually increase year after year. It Is right to state that the total receipts during the past half-year show an increase of &l,0001. over those of tlie corresponding period of 18:56, and it is probable that a large portion of it belongs to the ordioiary increase of traffic en the old lines. On the other hanid, the increase in the working andotherexpensesappearsto be about 67,OOO. nicre than at the corresponding period of 1856, so that for the present the expenses consequent on the developenuent of the new hiies appear to have more than absorbed the advantages ot the increa ed traffic during the halfyear. Daring the first half of tho year the tratfic iS considerably less on the (reat Western lines than in the seccond half-year ; this differenre might be eitii,,ated from foriner returns ataboat J90,0001., while the ditlerence in the working expenses may be taken at about 20,0001., so that the result of the second half-year's working. even sliould the traflic on the new lines not increase, will show a considerable improvement in the suIIm available for dividend at the end of the year. There is another matter, in the present state of the money-,market, which acts injuruou0ly to the Great Western ; that is the very large proportion of their borrowed capital to the ordinary capital, sing alout O,5i00,0001. against 8,2950,01?01. of ordinary stock. The increase of 1 per cent. in the rate of interest on the boro-wed mitoney would alone redr.ce the ordinary dividend by I, per cent., quite irreepcecive of the traffic, and, iic-c i0su, a decrease in the rate of interest on the borro-ed money w,ul:d raise tho dividend on the ordinary stock. '1The convcrsion of the whole of the borrowed capital isto a four ner Celit. debenture stock would be of considerahic arivauitago to the ordinary shareholders. Considering that very nearly everything is now heing charged against revelue, both in rcspect of capital and traffic, in this, the least productive half of the year, that all the conapaa'shiioes aref cuim-plrted anid opened for trdtlic, it may be presumedtlhat rthoGreat Western lailw.wy comopanyliavearrived at their lowest dividend, and as the traffic and re.s-urces of the undertaking becomiie mnore pr.ductive, and incrowe beyornd those of the past half-pe%r. the ordinary shareholder may lobk forward t;m a prop),rtih nate imerease of dividend. Tbe cozi-pany have now 467i, nui!es of rnilway in operation, v;ith ace. - to several seapor's agaimmst 367j miles at the cou resl.odinig perhnd of 18.;5. It is prohable that the traflic on the l10l miles of a,(iieionnlnriilway vw1llincreAsefromtimno to tiue as on all other new fines, pay tliqir weorkiz,g expenses, and eventually yield a profit on the rworhsing. At present the tra'iic rn thei old lines pays time interest and preference dividend on the capital wlhich has been expenided on time new lines. Tnume being as it were already p;aid for by the ordinuwry shareh-lders, it is clear that whatever mllay be the increase of traffic or profit on those new lines it inist go dir- etly t- :rds increasing the dividends of the ordinary shareluolders. 'ULSTER. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the past half year show an increase of 2,80001. over those of the corresponding period of 1856, and the expenses duri;h- tile saimie time show an increase of 1,65:5/., which, bhem. er, comprises several exceptional items. The -anlg fte h.lf-Sear have been 3C S411., aud the work ing xpe,,ses, including rates and taxes, 15,013l., leasing a net bahLnce of 2t.-8281. After deducting fronT this sum the interest on borrowed capital there rezmiains 17,83:iq., o,ut of which thie directors recomnnend a dividend of 30s. per share (less intome-tax), being at the rate of 6 per cent. per anau,,, payable on th e 20th inst., leaving 3,0111. to be carried to the reserve fand. Daring the halfyear the sum of 5,6341. has been paid on capital account, including 1,9581. for additions to the company's works, 2,2341. for waggons, &c., and 1,2v7?. for interest on the capital subscribed to the l'ortadown and Dungannon Conipany. The directors, in conjunction with the Dublin and Belfa.t Conipaimy, opposed the Bill prosecuted by the Newry anid Enniskillen Comnpany for extentding their line to Armagh. The Bil has, however, been sanctioned by the cowmnittees of both Houses of Parliament. If the bridge over the Blackwater be combpleted in the time specified the Portad,.wn and Dungannon line will bc opeiied abomt the end of Septeuiber. The company's extension Bdl for the line to Omagh has received tIme sanction of Parliament. Daring the balf-year the forfeited shares were allotted in accordance with the arrangement submitted to and sanctioned by the proprietors. instalnients to the amount of 20,7G81. had been received up to the 3uuth of June iu addition to 7,475?.. on account of premsinins. This latter sum has teen carried to the reserved fund. A copy of the report sent to each shareholder c.ntains a fornt at foot which is filled up stating the siumber and description of shares of which he is a registered holder. Tihere is also appenided to the report a list ef the names and addresseFs of shareholders in the ceompauy, risting ishing those wleo hold the requisite nuimiber of shares ro qualify the-n fmr the office of director. The capital accoeut shows thaS 719,1401, had been received,od 701,M5'l expended, leaving a balance against the company of 42,4581. TILBURY, MALDON, AND COLCHESTER. A circular has been issued stating that the deposits paid by the ahareholdersiu this scheme, which is now abandoned, are to be returned in full, with jnterest at the rate of5per cent, from the 1st of January last.

TuE SEssio0. -The AMinisterial vhitebait dinner, in anticipation of the close of the session, will sake place *u Saturday next, at the Trafalgar, Greenwich. The public business has so far advanced, in spite of needless obAtruetions, that the termination of the session may Dow be confidently looked for. Every effort will be made to bring the *ession to a close on Saturday, the i2d inst., so as to enable Her Majesty to prorogue Parlianieut in person, previous to the departure of the Court for the north, which will take place on 31onday, the 24th inst., in the event of the session being over at the expected time.-ObAscrrcr. AN-OTHER OUrl.ItEAK OF THE FIRE AT EDINBUERGH. -On Friday morning, about half-past 10, the flames again broke forth from the smouldering ruins of the conflagration of Wednesday. After the fire had apparently been extinguished the engines and firemen had been withdrawn, when suddenly a flame burst forth from the windowvs of the Savings Bank, occupying the small corner of the building that had previously escaped the ravages of the flames, and in the course of a very short timiie the whole interior of the hank on the second and third stories (the intermediate iloor. ing having been removed to form a large airy saloon) was in a blaze, jets of flame pouring forth from every window. Again, for a time, the energies of the firemen were paralyzed for want of water, and about half an hour elapsed until the pressure on the hose was sufficient to operate with eff ct upon the flames. The fire was confined to this corner, but in an hour the whole interior of the bank (from which the money and books had been removed on Wednesday) was gutted and destroyed. The ruins left by the cornflgration exhibit a sad, but picturesque spectacle. The massive group of buildings, nine stories high on the north side and five on the south, may be described as divided inlto four buildings, a strong gable wall, surmounted by ranges of chimneys af great altitude, protecting the one from the other. Two of these buildings, or one-half of the whole mass, have been unroofed and gutted, the whole floors giving way oiie af ter the other, having fallen to the lowest level. Viewed roen below, the bare calcined and blackened waLls outside the tail beetling chimneys, rising 120 feet into the air, and the ruined interior penietrated by the light, and showing still throughout a series of nine stories the ruins of dis. mantled firesides and the dosiestic iitbnsils of the occupants still hanging by the grates,* together form one of the most remarkable pictures ever exhibited by the ruins of a conflagration. Three tail piles of chimneys have been condemned ty the Dean of isuild Court, but how to remove themi is a most difficult question. It is now ascertained that 40 families, or about IhOindividuals, have been renidered house. less by the fire, and on Friday afternoon a psiblic meeting was held to tak-e measures to relieve them. Already expressionis of sympathy have come in from many quarters. The Duke and Duchess of Montpensier, who were on a viEit to Edinburgh as the time, sent through the Lord Provost a letter of sympathy, enclosing 15L, while the l)Dcbess of Keent, before she left Edinburgh on Friday morning, sent through Sheriff Gordon 25t. The French ConsUl and other strangers have vied with the other citizens in this work of benevolence, and at the close of the meeting, before any general measures were taken, the sum,, of 1I)!. bad been ratsed. To show the poverty of the sufferers it may be men. tiotned that their annual rents rarged froimi 3. to 5., and, with one exception,we believe, none of them are insured. COLONIAL GOVPI.X(ntm S AND BlsHt,pS.-A list of all the Governors and Lieutenant-Governc,rs of oiur colonies, with tbeir salaries and the date of their appointments, has just been published by order of the Comiimons House, on the motion of Mr. Clay, M1.P. The highest salary is that of the (.overnor of V'ictoria, whichi islOiTh!. . a.ymar, ahilethe Governors of Canada, Ceylon, and IN,W Sonth %Vales receive 7,0( 01. a-year each. There is also a list of colonial bishops sal; siid by the State ; these receive sti i, 4ds varying from 46.01. to 2,5001. The BishoD of Barbadoes, Dr. Parry, receives 2,50oll., X hle the Bi-beojs of Quebec and Toronto only receive 1.9!Q0l. and 1,2.501. respectively. THE (GREAT HOPE CAS;E.-AIr. and 'Mrs. Hope, after numerous legal proceedings relative to their divorce and to the possebbion of their children, bef(re the courts both of Eiiglanid and France, came in Mlarcl), 1855, to an arrangemient that their youngest child, John Henry, should remuaiu with Mrs. Hlope, and tbat the otbers, four in number, should go to their father, Mrs. Hope reserving to her. i-elf the plivilege of seeing and corresponding wvith her children; Mrs. Hope, besides, consented to aiandoun an application for divorce which she had niade in England, and undertook not only not to oppose but to promote the denmand for divorce made by him against her in that country. Yebstrday Mr. Hlope applied to the civil tribunal to oider that the child in question should be given up to him, and he based his deniand on the ground that the Court of Chancery in England had decided that all the children should be placed under his care, and that as the arrangement of March, 1635, was not legal, he was not bound by it. Mrs. Hope, in reply, insisted that the interests of the child, who is only 10 years of age, re. quired that he should be left unider her care ; and she represented that, as her hnsband was an Englishinian, and as she by her marriage to himi must be considered English also, a French tribunal had no jurisdiction over themii in such a matter. She also represented that if the arrangement of Mlarch, 155), was not binding in law, there vas nothing to prevent the tribunal from declaring that it was equitable, and that it should be acted on. Lastly, shle urged that as Mr. Elope thought fit to live apart froni, her, amid refuse to fulfil the duties of husband towards her, though no separatioxi between theni had been pronounced in France, he was not warranted in insisting on exercising alone paternal power over all their children. The tribunal decided that as the parties are English, as Mr. Hope refused to receive his wife into his house, though nDt legally separated from her, snd as, besides, the interes!s of the child required that he should remijain with his mother, it (the tribunal) had no )urisdiction in the matter, and that Mr. Hope's application umust be dismissed with costs.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-I have just seen in your impression of yesterday the letter of the Rev. C. James, assistant-master of Eton, upon the suppression of the publio school matches at Lord's. I doubt whether the feeling of satisfaction with which I road it wil be shared by his ooleagues; but since, apart fromits merits in point of argument, this manifesto may fairly be presumed to contain, substantially, the case of the autho rities, I trust to be allowed space for a few words of com. ment upon it, in addition to what has been already so well said upon tho subject in your columns. The objections to the matches are, then, twofold 1.'The exposure of tho boys to the temptations of London. 2. Their inconvenient detention from their homes. Mr. James begins by disposing of the second objection s one which is"the parents' concern, not ours," following up this admission by an assertion (for no proof of this point is even attempted) that "the case becomes widely different when the first objection is considered." Now, most people, I think, would arrive at the opposite conclusion, and would' argue a fortiori that the supervision and care of the boys morals during their holydays were even more essentialy and legitimately a parent's concern than the inconvenience of their detention from their homes. Upon the actual amount of risk which a week's stay in London during the continuance of the matches would involve I shaUl have a word or two to say presently. As a parent, and having boys of my own at Eton, I may at least claim credit for having seriously considered this point according to the best of my judgment; but the point really at issue, and to which I wish for the present to confine myself, is the antecedent question as to the jurisdiction in this case of the school authority. If the principle of interference during holyday time with the parental authority be once admitted where is it to atop? Wby should we not hear next that a prohibition has been laid upon any other amusement which the authorities may think undesirable? -against going to theatres ?-against going to racecourses ?-against an hundred other conceivable occupations, which all probably would agree have their objectionable side, but which all hithe rto have equally agreed were during holyday time, matters wholly and solely at the discretion of parents to allow or to forbid? The reductio od aosurdum, however, is reaUy superflaous. Is Mr. Jamesis any one -prepared to claim on behalf of the Echool authorities a right to interfere with the occupations of the boys during the vacation ? I have reason to know, on the contrary, that some of them at least are already aware that they stand with regard to this question in a false and untenable position. Let us suppose a case. The feeling with regard to the suppression is strong and general-quite as much so, as far asI can judge, among parents as among others. Suppose the parents of the Eton eleven of next year, acting in concert, should decide that their boys should play at Lord's as usual, and that the match were to take place accordingly. Does any one believe that the HeadMaster would venture to carry out his threat of expulsion; or, that if he were to attempt to do so, he would be supported either by public opinion or by the courts of law, to which an appeal would assuredly be made? All well-wishers of Eton wonld regret that matters ever should come to this; but the responsibility of such a state of things, if it were to occur, must rest with those who should persist in an erroneous coursv for that worst of all reasons-that they are too far committed to recede. And now, Sir, one word, in conclusion, as to the reality and amount of the evil which is made the plea for this stretch of authority-thle risk, namely, of subjecting to the temptations of London boys without a home there. God forbid that I should feel or write lightly upon such a point ! It is my conviction, however, both that the extent of the risk has been greatly and purposely exaggerated, and that nothing would be easier than to extinguish it altogether. The cases-to which alone the objection applies-of boys without either homes or friends to receive them in town have always been quite exceptional. In these the parents have, of course, the remedy in their own hands; and a little concert and co-operation with them on the part of the school authorities might secure its invariable application. It is a mere pretext to say, as it has been said, that parents require any support in such a case from the magisterial autbority, or that any pressure is brought to bear upon defaulters by their schoolfellows. I could name one instance in which a boy was during two years a member of the eleven of his school (Harrow), and having no friends in London to receive him abstained, at the desire of his friends, from taking part in the matches at Lord's, and without incurring thereby the smallest odium among his schoolfellows. There are many points of which much remains to be said, but I have aleady trespassed too niuch upon your spacs. Mr. James forgets that the " neutral ground" of which lie speaks is the great head-quarters of cricket, and that a match played on the private ground at Eton or Haarros- is no substitute whatever for those at Lord's, viewed either as a stimulus and encouragement to cricketing skill in the respective schools, or as an interesting annual "reunion" of those quondam members of them who have few or no other opportunities of meeting each other. I . _ Your obedient servant. ETONIAIN. ifllursdray, Aug. 6.
TO THE EDITOR OF THEE TIES. Sir,-In your article contrasting the respective schemes for the drainage of the metropolis proposed by the Metropolitaa Board of Works and Sir B. Hall's referecs, while you have fairly described the latter as more comprehensive, and therefore better entitled to support, you have omitted to point out its glaring defects. It viiU hardly be believed at this stage of the discussion, after the mass of evidence adduced, proving to demonstration the fatal effects produced by the present defective system, that it is proposed by three eminent scientific men to construct tvo huge ditches of the width of 35 and 38 feet, and 16 feet deep, with a sluggish fall of only six inches in a mile, parallel to the railways, on each side of the riveron the north side from Barking to Mucking Lighthouse, and on the south side from Woolwich to Higham Creek (nearly 20 miles on each side), and this at an estimated cost of five millions and a-half ! The proposition at this time of day is so monstrous that one can hardly be surprised that even those watchful guar. dians of the public health, the metropolitan press, are caught napping. A brief paragraph in a long report alone conveys any intimation of this extraordinary proposal. " The great extent to which the sewage will be diluted after the outfall channels have been fed witli the tidal water at Barking and Plumstead wlln render it a comparatively innoxious stream ; for this reason, we are of opinion that it wvould he inexpedient to incur the expense of covering the cbanns.ls except in the neighbourhood of towns, buildiags and crossings of public roads."ws,bidn, Surely, Sir, this ought to arouse public indignation. A comparatively innoxious stream ! WVhy, is it not notorious to all the world that when diluted with the whole volume of the Thames the sewage is sufficient to poison the whole population of the river ? Does not Black liod stand aghast. and the Sergeant-at-A rms shake in his shoes at the bare idea of inhaliag from their windows the tainted gale ? Does not Mr. Adderley, oblivious of Hansar-d, furiously assault the Lambeth nuisanc6s, and fail to perceive that a worse nuisance than 20 Lambeths is impending ? Of what offence have the pleasant places along the barks of our stream been guilty that they should be made desolate ? Is Sir B. Hall plotting the destruction of the Protestant Alliance, and intent on insidiously undermining the health of that eminent defender of the faith Sir Cnlling Eardley ; and has he instructed his myrmidons to lay siege to BelTidere, and cast a stagnant ditch about it ? But why, then, should Erith, Greeuhithe, PurHlet, Grays, Northfleet, Gravesend feel the weight of the Adilian indignation ? Sir, this much vexed question seems to be assuming the niagnitudo of an Institution; it grows bigger, more costly, and mnore dangerous every year. Somne seven years ago a commission of eminent engineers, miUitary iand civil. after due deliberation, instructed Mr. Frank Forster, who produced a plan characterized by ALr. Stephenson in the highest terms; indeed lie partially identified Ihimself with it, and at a cost under 1,500,0001. The Commission, however, abounding in talent, was utterly deficient in cash, con. sequently unable to execute its own plans, and after falling first among lawyers, and then among engineers, itscost attained the respectable dimensi2ns of 3,000,0001. In the hands of the present referees we are threatened with the portentous sum of 5,500,0001. ! From your reports of the debates of the present board, when discussing their own project, it appeared that a considerable diversity of opinion existed as to the fall whicih ought to be given to the main sewers; their most eminent predecessors had, it appeared, settled that four feet per mile was the least they ought to have, whereas the present board wvere advised by their engineer that they could do with two feet per mile, but ho seemed to think It ought not to be less. The referees, however, imuproving upon him as lie improved upon his predecessors, when they nearly doubled his estimuate, reduced the inclination of their sewers to six inches per mile. Now, Sir, I havQ lived all my life by the river side, and I know the bed of the Thames above Blackwall falls about two feet per nmile - and I do not require a galaxy of eminent talent to tell me that, with all the scour of the tide, aided by the steamers, shoals aro continually forming, and require a vast deal of dredging to keep them down-a great deal more, indeed than they get; and if this takes place in the Thames, what will hapuen in the big ditches? 'Why, Benjamin's mess will be five times greater than any other mess. Pray, Sir, arouse the sleepers on the banks to these facts. and tell them also that the referees recommend that all towns and villages near the line of the main outfall sewers should discharge their sewage into these channels, and should contribute to the cost of constructing and maintaining them-so they will have the pleasure of being poisoned and the privilege of paying for it. I am, Sir. vonr-s rnertfnllv FRED. DOULTON. Lamnbebb, Augt S.
