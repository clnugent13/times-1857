THE GLASGOW POISONlNG CASE.. TRIAL OF MISS MDELEINE SMITH. THuIRSDAY, JULY 2.-TmRD DAY. The trial of Madeleine Hamilton Smith for the murder of Pierre Emile L'Angelier was resumed at the High Cou rt of Justiciary, Edinburgh, this morning at 10 o'clock. The prisoner stiU looked fresh and animated, but in the course of the day became a little more restless and excited than she had previously, and particularly wheu her former school companion, Miss Buchanan, and the gentleman to whom she was latterly engaged, Mr. Minnoch, were in the box. Charles O'Neill deposed to the accuracy of a plan of the house,. 7, Blytbswood-square, which he had drawn. It showethat Mr. Smith, father of the prisoner, occpied a house consisting of a street floor and sunk floor, Mr. Mmnnoch and Mr. Douglas residing in the floors above. The house was situated in the corner of Blythswood-square and Main-street, into which several of the wiudows looked, and among others the bedroom windows of Miss Smith in the lower and partially sank floor. Any person putting his arm through the grating could tap at Miss Smith's window there, and if au3,thing was let fali it would fall about the level of the sill of the winde5r, and any persorn inside could easily take it in. The declaration of the prisoner was then read. It was as follows:- "M My name is Madeleine Smith. I am a native of Glasgow, 21 years of age, and I reside with my father, James limith, architect, at No. 7, Blythswood-square, Glasgow. For about the last two ) ears I have been acquainted with P. Emile L'Angelier, who was in the employment of W. B. Ruggins and Co., in Bothwell-street, and who lodged at 11, Franklyn-place. He recently paid his addresses to me, and I have met with him on a variety <.f occasions. I learned about his death on the afternoon of Monday, the 23d of Mlarch current, from mamma, to whom it had been mentioned by a lady named Miss Perry, a friend of M. L'Angelier. I had not seen M. L'Angeher for about three weeks before his death, and the lsmt time I saw hipn was on a night about half-past 10 o'clock. On that occasion he tapoed at my bedroomt window, which is on the ground iloor, md fronts Main-street. I talked to him from the window, which Is stanchioned outside, and I did not go out to him, nor did he co)ne in to me. ThisoccasLon whicb, as already said was about threeweeks before his death, was the last time isa him. He waain the habit of writing notes to me, and I was in the habit of replying to him by notes. The last note I wrote to him was on the Friday before his death-viz., Friday, the 20th of March current. I now see and identif that note and the relative envelope, and they are ech marked No. 1. In consequence of that note I expected him to visit me on Saturday night, the 21st current, at my bedroom window in the same way as formerly mentioned, but he did not come and sent no notice. There was no tapping at my window on said Saturday night or on the following night, being Sunday. I went to bed on Sunday night about 11 o'clock, and remained in bed till the usual time of getting up next morning, being 8 or 9 o'clock. In the course of my mneetings with M. L'Angelier he and I had arranged to get married, and we had at 'one time proposed September last as the time the marriage was to take place, ard subeequently the pretent month of March was spoken of. It was proposed that we should reside in furnished lodgings, but we had not made any definite arrangement as to time or otherrwise. He was very unwell for some time, and had gone to the Bridge of Allan for his health, and he complained of sickness; but I have no idea what wasthe cause of it. Iremembergiving him some cocoa from my window one night some timng ago, but I cannot specify the time particularly. He took the cup in his bandand barely tasted the contents, and 1 gave him no bread with it. I was taking some cocoa myself at the time, and had prepared it myielf. It was between 10 and 11 p.m when I gave it to him. I am now shown a note or letter and envelope which are marked respectively No. 2, and I recognize them as a note and envelope which I wrote to ML VZAngelier and Eent to the post. As I bad attributed his sickness to want of food, I proposed, as stated in thenote, to give him a loaf of bread; but I said that merely in a ioke, and, in point of fact, 1 never gave him any bread, Ihnve bought arsenic on uvarous occasions. The lAst I bought wa a sixpenceworth, which I hgught in Currie the apothecar's, in Sauchiehall-street; and prior to that I bought other two quantities of arsenic, for which I paid 6d. each-one of these in Currie's and the other in lurdoch the apo. thecary's shop, in Sauchiehall-street. I ued it all as a cosmetic, and I applied it to mny face, nepk, and arms, diluted with water. Tbe arsenic I got in Currie's shopl got there on Wednesday, the 18thcurrent., andIused it all on one occasion, having put it a1 in the basin where I was to wash myeelf. I had been advised to the use of the arsenic in the way I have mentioned bt a yownn lady, the daughter of an actress, nd I had also een the use of it recommended in the newsappers. The young lady's name was Jubilee (Giubilei), and Thad met her at school at Clapton, near london. I did not wish any of my father's family to be aware tbat I was usipg the rsenic, and therefore never mentioned it to any of them, and I don't suppose they or anyof the servants ever noticed any of it in the basin. oen I bou ht the arsenic in Murdoch's, I am not sum whether I was asked or not what it was for, but I think I said it was for a gardener to kill rats or destroy vermin about flowers, and I only said this because I did not #ish them to know that I was going to use it as a cosmuetic. I don't rexnember whether I was asked as to the use I was going to make of the arsenic on the other two occagorp, but I likely made f110 sameniemnent-atovit -t as-vi had done-in srdocks-- and on all the three occasions, as requlrdd in the' shops, I signed my name to a book in'wich ihe tiles were entered. On7tlhe first occasion I was accompanied by Mary, a daughter of Dr. Buchanan, of Dtnabarton. For several ears past Mr. Minnoch, of tb,- firm of William Honldsworth anda Co., has been coming a good deal about my father's house; and- about a month ago MIr. Minnoch made a propomal of marriage to me, and I gave him my hand in token of accept4nce, but no time for the marriage has set been fixed; and myobject in writing the note No. 1, beforementioned, was to have a meeting with M. A'Dngelier, to tell him that I was engaged in marriage to Mr. Minnoch. I am now sbown two notes and an envelope bearing the Glasgow postmark of January 2&, which are respectively marked No. 3, and I recognize these as in my handwriting, and they were written and sent by me to ML L'Angelier. On the occasion that I gave M. IVAngelier the cocoa, as formerly mentioned, I think that when I used it It must have been known to the servants and members of my father's family, as the package containing the cocoa was lying on the mantelpiece in my room, but not one of the family used it except myself, as they did not seem to like it. The wvater which I used I got hot from the servants. On the night of the 18th, when I used the arsenic last, I wras goinz to a dinner party at Mlr. hlinnoch's house. I never dministered, or ceased to be administered, to M. L'Angeher arslemo or anything injurious, And this I declare to be troth. "~ MADELEmB Srurn?r. Mary Jane Bnchanan,-I reside with my father, Dr. Buchanan, at Dumbarton. I am acquainted with Miss Smith. I was with her on the 6th of M rch inSauchiehallstreet, when she went into Cnrrie the druggist's shop. She nasked for arsenic. She was told she must sign her name. tThe shopman did not a sk wrhat she was to do with it, hut 1asked her. She said it was to kill rats. She got the Brsenic-I th ink six penny worth. The shopmnaa suggested phosphor paste to kill rats, but she said it had been tried tef'ore, and it was~ nnssuocessfuL. She said they were going to the Bridge of Allan, and that there was no danger of leavnug arsenic in the cellars wvhile the family were absent. t think she asked how much would be a dose for the rats, sad he staid the quantity she named would kill a great tnnny. She said she only wished it for that Purpose. WYe had no more conlversation about it, but I ilau he xt the idea of a young lady buying arsenic. Mxiss Imith said nothing, hut she laughed wi th me. I was 2t school with Miss Smith at Clapton, near Ision. Ve were a year there together, and I have been acquainted vith her since. I am familiar with her handwriting. I ecamined a number of letters in the Procurator-Fiscal's- dlce, wvhich I canie to the conclusion wvere in her handwiting. I thick I first became acquaintedwith Mliss Smith is 1852* or 1853. Her full name is Madeleine Hamilton iothL In the course of last spring she wrote to me, telling ne she w.as engaged to be married. This was in the end of February last. The gentlemanl was Mr. Minnoch. She sioke to me also on tbe subject on the 6th and again on the 31th of Mlarch, On the inst occasion she spoke of the marOrisge as cbeing to ta.ke place in June, She spoke of no doubt Cross-examined.-I live at Dnmbarton. I was visitin tGlasgowv on the 6th of March. I had visited at hfr. Smith's house at Row when they lived there, and I also visited at Ilyths wood-scuare whenlI was in Glasgow. Mss Smith was not in when I called On the 6th of March, but she came in while I was there. We went out together. .She said she wished to talk with me about her marriage, ,but I had no time to wait. She said she would walk so far on thb way with me. There was a school promise between us that wvhichever of us was first married should have the other as bridesmaid. We went from Blythswood-squiare to Sauchiehall-street, and along it. This was the way I was going. Oncomning to Currie's she said, " Oh, just step a m1inute; I want to go into this shop." There were two young me behind the counter. We both went forward to it. She asxe mr rsenc. 'ho mn sad sh mus sig thebook askedftorarseDlc. ThermaanFsa-id sho em-u8st si-gu the"bo-o-k. She said she would sign anything they liked, and signed "AL Smith," and aked if that would do, and the man said, "Yes." Miss Smith first asked the young man, "How do you sell arsente ? Would sixpence worth be a large quantity ?" I did not sign the book. Everything was done very openly. W hen we *ere at school together at Clapton I renember something about arsenic. I remember either at lesson or in our evening reading of onr reAding an aount of the Styrian peasants taking arsenic to give them breath in climbing steep mountains, and about their havirg a pecualar plumpness and rosinessof appearonce. Ireromember Miss Giubilei, who was a pupil-teacher in the school, She was at the reading at the time, I think. We were always obliged to be at the evening reading, and I should think that Miss Smith wonld be there. By the Courtr.-I met Mise Smith by appointment on the 6th of March, Sbe knew I was coming, and she wrote. ne,w akingtbe appointment at half pas s t I saw her on the 30th.j tbink I was with her from 3 to half-past 4. I saw her then in her own house, I had been visiting Glaagow for a week or two, Nothing particular passed between us on the 30tb. I asked her about her marriage, and we spoke of together. 31rs. Walcot(formerly Augusta Giubilei).-I waa papilteacher r is chool at Clapton in the year 1852. I never adised the prisoner to useaenic as a cosmetic, or to apply it to her face and arms diluted with water; nor, indeed to use it in any way. I never had any conversation with ter about the use of arsenic, that I recollect of. I believe I never had any conversation with her at all about the use of cos- metics. I recollect a fact occurring on our reading of mountaineers taking small quantities of arsenic to improve their breath, and that those who so took it were remarkable for their plumpess. I'believe I never had any conversation with the prisoner about this passage. W iIam Murray, lately page to, and rebiding with, Mr. Fmith,-I wenttoMr. Smith's service in Wlovembeila.t. I IlePt in the room as you goin at the low front door, on the lets hand aide. . Miss Madeleinie mith alept.on, the right hband side beyond the kitchen-a rooma which has two windows to Main-street. There werealso a cook and housemaid in the house, named Christina Eaggart and Charlott3 n'Leau. They slept in the room at the otherend of the passage, on the left. 3Miss Mladeleine once sent me to am apothecary about four months ago. I recollect her being msed from home one morning. It was about six weeks or two montha before that I was at the apothecary's. I went for prussic acid. Sho gave me a line. with the words " a small phial of prossic acid." I took it to an apothecary's, Dr. Yeaman't, in Sauchiehall-street, but they would not give it me. I went back to Miss Smith, and told her SO. She said, ' Very well - never mind." She said she wanted it for her hmnds. I did not know M. L'An.eher by sight or otherwise. I have posted letters for Mss Smith. I have observed some with somethiR like tbat name, but I never could make out what it was. St was my business to look the area gate, but I sometimes forgot. I went to bed about 10 on Sunday, the 22d of March. I sleep very sound. I heard no noise before the morning. Miss Madeleine had not gone to her room when I went to bed. It was on the Thursday after the Snnday Niss Smith was found missing. Mrs. Smith told me about 10 o'clock she was missing. She came back at night. I recollect Christina Baggart being unwell that Sunday. She kept her bed till about 6 o'clock. After coming down from worship on Sunday night I went to bed. Cross-examined.-I went to Dr. Yeamau's as the nearest sbop. iss Smith did not tell me to go to any particular shop. She waa in the bedroom, and called me from the kitchen quite loudly when she sent me on the message. The other servants could hayv heard her if they had been listening. She said she wanted a small phial of prussic acid, and I must take care of it, for it was poison. The shopman askedwhoitwasfor, andItoidhim. Hesaid he couldnot get it without a physician's hne, for it was a very rank poison. The family last winter were Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Mr. John Smith, and Misses; Madeleinm Bessie, and Janet Smith. Miss Madeleine is the eldest, Bessde the second, and Janet the youngest. I think Miss Janet wil be about 12 or 13. She always slept with Miiss Madeleine in the same room and bed. I had no charge of the back door-only the front area gate and upper front door. It was generally the cook who locked the back door, also the front area door. I remember all the servants and family were at prayers the night of Sunday, the 22d. The usual hour is 9 o'clock. When I came down I first went into the kitchen, and stopped about five minutes, and then went to bedL I was waiting at breakfast next morning. Msis Smith was there just as usual. There was a young man named Mackenzie who visited Christina Haggart' at this time. She is married to him now. Miss Smith and Janet sometimes got hot water in a jug from the kitchen before going to bed. I did not see Mackenzie that Sunday Beexamined..-I heard nobody go out or come in on the night of the 226d. There are two keys to the area gate. One of them is generaUy kept in the kitchen, hanging on a naiL The keys of the front doors are generally left in the inside of the doors. Re-cross-examined.-The entrance to the back area is not a gate, but a door. It is too high for mo to climb. There is broken glass on the top. George Yeaman, physician, Sauchlehallstreet, Glasgow, -I recollect a papcer p resented to me by my assistant, on which was written "htalf an ounce of pruesSco acid," This ws four to eight weeks previously to Glasgowr election, which Was on the 31st of MKarch. When the line was brought to meI went into the shop and saw a boy. He told mhebecame from Miss Smith, Blythawood-squaro. I asked whether he knewr what he wanted. He answrered that he thought it was poison. I then said if Mliss Smith woald call herself I would see whether or not she could have It. Miss5 Smith did nott come, that Isaw or heard of. George MuIrdoch, druggist, SauchiehaU-.street.--Shown 185 of the inventory, being his register of all arsenic he sold in retail. There is an entry there, dlated " February 21. Miss Smith, 7, Blythawood-square, sixpcence worth vf! arsenicofor garden in country-house. (Signed) M. E1. Smith.' Mtiss Smith came alone for it, a8 far aslI remember. I;vas in oneof the back rcoms when mnyasst antaUed my attention to a lady wishing to purchase arsenic, and I ocame forward and recognised Miss Smith. Inamed to her the form wre must-keep. She said It was for her country-house. I ws aware MIr. Smith had a house in the country. I signed' the' tegister, as also my assistant. It was common white arsenic mixed with soot, in the proportion required by the A ct. I saw M&iss 8mith again on the subject, when she cslled and inquiredif arsenic should not be white. I sadi eurd to be sold colourd She dlid not then purchasany ore.James Dickle delivered to Dr.'Penney afitewards a similar quantity of arsenic to that given to Miss Smith, and from the same bottle. Cross-examiined.-My shop is three or four minutes' walk from Blythswood-equare. The family were in the habit-of dealing with me. One and a hal£ ounce is the quantity usually sold for 6dL The arsenic was not, I think, paid for, but dharged to Mfr. Smith's account, along with some sodaw ater got the same day. James Dickie, assistant to Mr. MWurdocli, corroborated his evidence. The arsenic was entered as unpaid'in our book, and put to Mlr. Smith's account. That account has not been rendered. Miss Smlith took the arsenic away hersslf. Cross-examined.-I have been with Mfr. Murdoch foreix years, MIr. Smith had an account standing in our books. I put the entry of the arsenic first in.the scroll-book, And it was afterwards entered up in the ledger, charged to M;r-: Smith. This satisfies me it ws not. paidi.or byMZiss8 Smith. Some sodawrater is entered the same ka aS the arsenic. L. George Haliburton, assistant to.

Itis "Mlarch 6, Mias Smith, one ounce arsenic, to lillrats." My Signature and her signature follow. Miss Smith said the rate wrere in the house in Blythewood-square. I recommended phosphoruls pastel hut she said she h,sd tried that and it had failed. Shes aid the family were goiSg away that day to Bridge of Aillan, and she would take care to put it dow herself. She got the arsenic .an paid for it. Our ar8enic is- mixed with indigo to colour it.- Ifind: another entry on the 15th of March, exactly the same as before. She then came -in and asked for another sirpence worth She said she had come back for it because the first was so effectual. she having found seven or eight large rats lying dead. M§r. Currie was in at the time, Ulad he made some objection to her getting it. I told him she had got it before, and he allowed me to get it. A young lady, wrhom I took to be her sister, was with her. I niever heard of arsenic such as I gave Mdiss Smith being used, as st cosmetic, but a preparation of arsenic is used as a depilatory for taiF fKso the face. That is the yellowr mslphurato of arsenic. Croessexamined.-Both,purchases were made quite openly. Mtiss Smith was accompanied by a YoUng lady on the first occasion whom Itdidnot know. The young lady said she always thought that arsenic was white hut I told her we were obliged to colour itby Act of Parliment. By the COURT.-AxenC is usedas a depilatory, because it so affects the skin that it takes out the roots of the hair. That is not the usual quality of a cosmetic. JohnuCnirrie, druggist, corroborated Haliburton's evidence as to the sale of arsenic to MSiss Smith on the 18th of March. HIe further deponed-I recommended her to take some other preparation to kill rats, and she said she did not insist upon it, bUt she would prefer having arsenic, as it had answered so well before. I told her she must sign the hook, which she readily agreed to do; and from heraffability and frau~knessIhaadno suspicion, and I desired the youtng man to giveit to her, She paid for it. I did not know the young lady wtith her. Williamu Campsie, gardener at Mfr. Smith's house at Rowaleyn. parish of Row.-I never got any arsenio from Mitss Smith to kill rats, and do not recollect ever having any conversa,tion-with her on the subject. I never used arsenic there for that purspoee. Croessexamined..-.We were very much troubled with rats. hut had not used ;raenic to destroy them. We had used phosphor paste, and foundb it to be effectuaL. We partly got quit of themby it. Robert Oliphant, stationer, Aryll-place, EHelensburgh.- I know the prisoner. She used to deal with our shop for envelopes andnoSe-paper. I have seen her handwriting. I was shown a variety of letters by the Procurator-Fiscal, and recognized themI as inMis Smith's handwritingandnd I rectgnized some d the envelopes as ha,ing come from our shop. They were sampedwith the initials "He. a S." specially for her. William Harper 3finnoch, examined by the SOLsCrrOnGtSh RAe.-I am a terchwant in Glasgow. and a partner of the firm of John I3ouldsworth and Co. I live in Mainstreet. above the house of Mr. James Smith. I have been intimately acquainted wvith his family for upwards of four years. In the courde of last winter I paid my -addreeses to Miss Smith, and I made proposals of marriage to her. She accepted these proposals. The timegof ofr marriage was fied bretleen us. Previously to that, I frst asked her gene. raLMm, without referene to any time. That was on the 28th of anuary. My attentions to her, I understood, had been such as to make her quite aware that I was paying my ad dresses to her. She accepted me on the 28th of Januame and -wearraoged more particularly on the. 2th of herch From the 28th of January to the end of March there was nothig which suggested any doubt to my mind Moto the engagement o'stinuingl q I had no idea that she wasentoaed to any other person, and I was aw-are of o attachment or peculiar intimacy between her and any other man. -The marrage was fixed to be on the 18th of June. Iast season I aeMiss Smith a presnt of a necklace ; it was some time in January. before the 28th. She went along with her family to the Bridge of Allan on the 6th of March; she remained there till the 17th. I visited the family while they were there. After leaving I received a letter from Miss Smith (No. 133); 'that is tbe letter; it is dated "Monday" merely. After she came home from Bridge of Allan she dined in my house with her father and mother ; that was on Monday, the 19th of March. I met her at dinner again at Mr. Middleton's on the 25th of March. I was not aware of anything wrong at that time. I called on Thursday morning, the 26th, at her father's house. She was not m the house. I was informed she had left the house, I went to Rowaley n in company with her brother, Mr. John Smith, to look for her. We went by train to Greenock, and then on board the steamer, and we found her on board. It was going to Helensburgh, and then to Row. It called at'Roseneath, and then returned to Greenock. We fonnd her in the steamer a little after 2 o'clock. She said sbe was going to Rowaleyn. I went on to Rowaleyn with her and her brother; andthen we ordered a carriage and drove her up to Glawgow to herfather's house. On reaching Glasgow I had no conversation with Miss Smith. I sw her again on the Saturday following. I had heard a rumour that something was wrong. She told me on the Saturday that she had written a letter to IL L'Aagelier, the object of which was to get back some letters wbich she had vrittentohim previously. She madenofurtherstatement atthat time. Isaw her again on the Sunday. There was noconversation on the subject then. I saw her on Monday and Tuesdey. On Tuesday morning she alluded to the report that L'Angelier had been poisoned, and she remarked that she had been in the habit of buying arsenic, as she had learnt at Clapton school that it was good for the romplexion. I had heard a rmnour that he had been poisoned. She aid nothinz further, and that was the last time I saw hers Before abe made these satements to meI was not aware that she was acquainted with I'Augelier.

When we met her in the steamer I asked her wby she had left honre, leavig her friends distressed about her; but I requested her Lot toreply then as there were too many yeople preseait.

I have beard him say on one or two occasions that he was subject to attacks of bowel complaint. Two occasions I recollect, ,but I can't say when, months previous to his death. I don't remember his saying that he had a bad attack of cholera in Belgium.

After several miscellaneous witnesses and further medical testimony, Ohristina Haggart, formerly servant to Mr. Smith, deposed to one or more clandestine interviews 'be. tweeii prisoner and deceased at the back area door, but could not fix any date, and heard no one come into the house on the night of Sunday, the 22d of March. Had known of their secret intimacy, and received letters under cover to herself for prisoner. Two witnesses had seen the deceased about 9- on Sunday night, going in a direction which might lead to Blythswood-aquare. -A constable on the beat had seen him once or twice near the house; but not on the Sunday night. Mr. and Mrs. Towers,Portobello, hadbeen isited by the deceased on the 16th of March, when he said be had lately takea some cocoa and coffee which had disagreed with him, and he thought he had been poisoned. Mary Arthur Perry had been a confidant o L'Angeier in his secret attachment, and knew o' *t progress and interruptions. On the 9th o' March he said to witness, I can't think why I was so nwell after getting that coffiee and chocolate from her." UJnderstood him to mean from prisoner. He said, " It is a perfect infatuation I have for her; if she were to poison me I would forgive her." Witness said, " What motive could she have to do you harm?" He said, "Perhaps she might not be sorry to get rid of me." Witness did not think, however, there was a serious suspicion on his mind. A debate arose as to the admission of the: voltininous correspondence founded on, which was objected to for the prisoner on various grounds, but the Court overruled the objection.

THE LATE FRIGRTFUL AoCJDEkB2Y ON T.lli NORTR KENT RAILWAY.' Xr. Carttar, coroner for West Kent, resumed the inquiry at the Plough Inn, Lewisham, from Tuesday last into the circumstances which caused the fearful collision that occurred on the North Kent Railway on Sunday, the 28th alt., atd by which no less than U1 persons lost their lives. The jury t their former sitting heard evidence as to the Identity of the bodies of the deceased, in order that they mightberemovedbytheir friendsforinterment. ' ; Bodkin Appeared s counsel on behalf of the SouthJZsho3aiwa3v Company; Mr. Burgon attended on behalf * Tbeinas Perry, the driver, and Edward Wbiffen, fiteman; Mr..

W. {, cottappeared on behalf of the relatives qf Thomnas F in, another sufferer; Mr. Norton, of the firm of Norton and Erlun,. atten4ed on behalf of the friends of Thomas and HoratioTurner; and Mr. Armstrong bn be; half of the friends of Francis Drake. John Nelson, stationmaster at Tewishiam, was the first witness ex6mited. He deposed as follows :-The 9 1 train: from Strood arrived at about 10 4O at the distanoo signal at Lewisham. It otaghS not to liave stopped at all, it being *Iiat is caUled a ion-stoping train. It was ue at Blackbeath atlO 17, atd ought tohave run teroughthe Lewisham station about 10 2b. I do tot know the cause of the delay between 10 20 and 'lO 40. It drew up at the distance dgnal because the danger light was against it. David Wylde put ap the signal, as the line was not clear between the junction sttion and Lewishaim. The train droewvithin the distance station, but the head of the train did nbt come within the xemaphore station by about .40 yards, After a few minutes,. theze being some passengers waiting, I said to Wylde, " Run down to ascet tan whether there is any roorW, and if so let. them pull up at the platform." I called Saxby, another porter, to stand by anud ake charge of the signals til Wylde came back.. On his return he sidthat the guard had assured him there no zoom whatever. I then walked dovni nyielf to We gad,an4ia da conversation with him aadthe dsiver, and they bothsmspred me there was no room. The drivet effered topullup;.but.Isaid, "Ifyou are full it is of nou,so doing so." I caine back to the signal box and looked at the needle, and saw thatbthe insmment remained at "Stop al; up" from thespnctionto us, and from 'us'to Blackheath. I.saidit was time to be " clear up," and I gave a tap on the boY, which was a signal to the mam to "clear up," but he ave no reply. I saw the signals . up at the junction. I thenwent half-way down the junction, and heard the Mlid KSeit train- pull up twice at their platform and saw it leave. It might then be five mlnutes to IL. The 915 train hadbeen standing there all that time. Iwas alarmedat see' ing a train dart through the bridge with two white lights iu front from Blackheath. I jumped off the platform and the collision icourrem just as I was jumping down. I ran down with all speed, n4 Raw the dreadfuL nature of the occur. rence,'. I went to Thomas Perry, the driver of. the 9 30 train,tthesecond.tra.in He was on the engine. Isaid, "How is this; how camne you torun past the red lightt? He replied, "It isa bhad job, lr. Nelson, I did not see the red light iv time to pull up." I then ran to the end ot histrain, and I meS Abbott, the head guardoti the 9.30 train rdnnihg up towarda Lewisham station. The 9 15 traiatathst time was within the distance signaL. I told him to run back to .-BIlakheath and to 'stop all up." Before he had got far I called him back. l said "Abbott, come back and examine the.state of my distance signal." He repl3ed, "Thats all correct, Sir, I saw it plainly." I said, *' Never .mind, come back with me," and referred him to signa and asked him .' What do you call that P' " That is ?l rght, Sir," said he. I then ran back to the signal statioD, where Ifound Wylde. Ilookedattheinutrument, and found it still in the same position-the indicetor standing at " Stopall up."-Isaid, "Howisthis WyldO' 1 He .eplied, "I cannot say; tho Blackhbata station ave pie tro Wbgts-o0 the instrument, to which I did not reply as the5needle dood at "Stop al up." The two beatx spoken of by Wylde tculd mean hat an up train o vas ready to sbrt. By Wylde's not replyingthe train ought not to havre come on. lif the needle stood at "allcletr up"' he would then have 7given one beaton theneedle andpass on the train No reply Indicated that the train wns -t remain, and the duty of tbe stationmalster, at Blackheath wras tohave kept the train. Wyldewvas absent aboutthree or four n-inutes. Saxlby could not in that interva have touched the gnial, or I should5bave heard it. Perry told me that ie did ac,tseethedistancesignaL Itwas a clearnigh%,not1fog. Wylde, though ating under my general intructiones gives sigpala of his own accord. . The iirst cause of the stOppage on the ne was the Woolwich-train collecting tickets at New Cross. I do Rot consider it was neceeeary to pla fog signals. If the train remains a few minutes ouly the danger sgnal is sanDicient, It is sumal with a non-stopping tisn to pass on beyond the distance signal and. to go on to the semaphore. When I called Abbott back to look at tho ta.te of my signal 1-did itfor mn own iustification. I don't' remember. Thomas Hill complaining of the state of the distance-aigpal two dals before the..accident. I am not aware that ahy pssengers got outof thetrain, and sat upoh the wirewMi4-aotaon -the signal. Such a cientmstance would alter thqr adjustment of the signa, 'and change the red light ts tine, white light. I do-not lmovw that any 4omr-.4 -watios- madeto Bli;kheath to. -justfy thb 930 ..o-.l tr93 .eame mucz-asmtan VV i - AU 4 *ibhnim. ; et . Tbe Mironer then proposed to examine Wylde, but 0 Mr. Nelson said that Wylde was in custody. -;r. W. C. Ednunds, connected .with the signal depart. 3 uent, explained by aid of a map the positions and distances of the signals, and said that aIthough there was a partial: cuve, yet the line was sunioiently straight to admit of the distance signal at Lewisham- being seen from the Blackbeath station. William Wyley ws then examined. He sid-I am gpard ef the 9l5train .from Strood. We were blocked up at Woolwich and Charlton. We atrived at Lewishan at 38 minutes past 10. at the distance station. We are required to sop at Blackheath, but not at Lewisham. We stopie there because we saw the distance signaL I saw it t fore I came to the first bridge. I put my break lghtly on, and then took it off agaiun because I found the driver was slackening his pace. About 100 yards from the distance sial hestopped "dead." I stood by my break in the rear of the train ti the Beckenham train eame up. I lookedat my tail light. There as only one. Ihada red .Iightinmyhand. When I heard the 930 train comingI went back about 150 yards and waved my light and -whistled. The itrain passed me. I cannot tell whether the guard noticed, me or not. It is not usual for us to have two tail Lghts. I could easily see the signal soon after starting from Blackheath, and I did notWobserve any change in it. There is nothing to4bstruct the view except the steam while the train is goingunder the bridge. My train was-waiting 18 or 20 minutes at the station before the collision. I cannot say whether any passengers got out during that time. I was at the off-dde ofthetrain;butthe signal wire is on the nearside. I never spoke to the driver of the 930 train. The speed of that train was Its usual pxedL I consider that I was under protectlon'when I catae within the distance station. It v.as not ma duty togo to the stationmaster, but it wAs his duty totell us whetherwe had better stop or go on. I kmow the 7th regulation for our guidance, which requir that vhen any obstruction takes place by the train stopping en ;he line the gurd should go back for half a mile, if necesary. to stop other trains from coming on; but I did rvot 'hink it necessary to do so on this occasion, as there was no obetruction. We were merely waiting for the aingal " Ai clear," which we believed would be given in two or three mrinutes. Samuel Saxby was next examined He sad,-I am cffice-porter. I was on the platform on Sunday last. Mr. Nelson directed me to take charge of the signal.box while he sent the signal man down to see whether there was any room in the train. I did nothing at the signal-box I d not touch the buttons, I am quite sure of that.. I received no signal. Mr. Nelson was standing outside. I was only there about three minutes, till Wylde came back. I halleft the-signal-box ten minutes before the collision took place. I4ad nothing to dowith the signallghts. Itdid not see any passengers get out of the train. It is not usual to employ the regular signal man on other duties. I derived my knowledge about working the signals from the printed instructions. George Hughes wss the next witness examined. He said, -I am an extra guardsman on the North Kent Rail. I was guard of the 9 15 train. After leaving the Blackheath station I observed thedistance'signalat "danger,".and Idthen put on the breaks and ran very slowly to the distncesigna, and afterwards very slowly to the semaphoie. Theporter came down and asked whether I had any room,- I told him I hadnot; and then the stationmaster came down, and I told him also that I had not room for any more passengers. I asked wbether I should draw up at the station; and he said I had better stay where I was. The driver said, " n it too bad the Beckenham train should keep us here waiting so long." The fireman immediately said, "Here is a train coming," and thecollision occurred. Thomss Hill, examined.-HXe said, I am the driver of the 915 train. When I passed by1the first bridgeIsawvared light attewisham distance si"naL. I immediately shut cff' my steam and sounded miy wh istile,annd dropped down gefitly to the distance signal, and went under protection inside the signal to the semaphore station, and there remained *aitin for the signal " All right." The watchman came and asked whether Ihad anyroom. I said "No." I asked how long thetrainbeforeushadgoneon, and he said ix or seven ninutes. I observed, "Then, we shall soon go on." The stationmaster (Mr. Nelson) then came and asked for room. I told himr we had none. He said there were about 150 passengers waiting and he did not know what to d- * ho * ould not telegraph to London, for his telegraph was ouat of inrder. About three minutes after that the 930 train came ,p and the collision took place. It had the effect of pushing us on forsome70 or 80yards towards the platform, The man I cal the watchmnan (Wylde) appeared to me to be per. fectly sober. The 9 30 train was travelling between 10 ad. 12 miles an hour. By Mr. Bnrgon.-It is usual to pass the distanoe signal towards the semaphore, even though the signal Is at 1' danger," supposing that we see nothing to obstruct us between the distance station and the semaphore, I think ;,bout 12 days ago I complained to Mr. Nelson that the dis. lancesignalwasout of order. Itdidnotshow whetherIt was a stop or a caution. He did not seem to be aware of it. I understoodhimto say he would getitaltered. It has frequently happened forthe distance signalto be out of order. It is lighted by gas, and has averygood light. The light is correct, but the lamp is not sufficiently round so as to be Eeen distinctly. I was told at Blackheath that allwas right, but owing to our stoppingat Woolwichand Charlton I knew that I shonld have to stop at $ewisham. On seeing theredlightI, of coune, stopped. Inordinary easessit would have been my duty to have gone through without stopping. Mr. Nelson, on being re-examined, said he had no recol. lection of Paying anvthingr to the last witness about the telegraph being out of otder, He certiny had often aid that the speakdng telegraph was out ofroder. Hle dmitted tbat 6cmplaints lad frequently been made that the distance signal was not correctly adjusted, and he had always attended4 to them. goe eoul not, get any-immediate ssist. anoe from London byreasonof the speakingtelegraph being nut of order. Vr. Eboral, the ranaer of the Eastern Counties Rail-way, was then eiamined, more especilly in reference to the wairt of screwjacks, xawk, and other tools at the station. He admitted that it waz dezirable there should be a aupply of such necessry articles, and it Was the rule for evey engine to carry with- it' a xcrewjack; but they did not expect to have, these accidents occr oh every portion of the line. -There was one- acrewjack, and another wAs brought from London bythe engine that was sent up to London to fetch the atationnaster, and a message was sent desiring that everything that was required should be immediately forwarled to the scene of the xecident He could not give an o,pinion as to whether more lives might have been saved if hnerohadbeen more screvwjks.

The weight of the birealivan was 6'. tons; and if more sewjaclc than -one had been used it woul have required a simultaneous movement, and even then no one could tell in whiclt way-the.engne, and breakvan I would fall. The only way to extrieate therufferers was As. tuaUly by cutting thezm-cut with saws and other means, for thejr limbs wre jammed Wnand the confusioziinti. whvich they were thrown was most dreadful, rendering it e*tremely dangerous for the men to proceedL on their puinful task.

Trom all we can glean up to the present moment it ypears that Arthur Davis, the second mats ofthe American lip Gondar, of Charleston, bad been ashore drinking with anumber of men, among whom were acme foreigners, and that he went on board about 12 or 1 o'clock in company with eitner a French or Spanish captain-it is not known wlich. Davis asked the watchman for a light to lis pipe, sad the two then had some beer to drink. In abont an hour and a half Williams, the watchman, was adlymed by the doorofthe berth in which he was being burst open, and on getting up he saw the foreigner falling towards -him, da Davis standing over him witha drawn bowio lnWe, exclaimi5You, -, if iou don't give up that sbeath you stole, I'l cat your throat. The first mate then came out of hi cabin, and said, " Come, Davis, let him alone' don't give him any more of it." "No," replied Davis," i -h -hve the - life." 'he foreigner then got up, when Davis knocked him down on the deck, and then deliberately took him up and threw him overboard. Previous to this the wntchman had tried, to pull D-vis off the foreigner, when he said, "Do yoi tale his parzt Then, Ill serve you the same," making a thrust at him with the knife.

Tho Lnrds Commissioners were the Lvord Chancellor, tho Earl of Harrowby, sand Lord !d'onteagle. Lord BELPER presented a petitionin favour of the romoval of Jewish Disabilities froni the members of the Jewish Synagogue, Nottingham; also a petition to the same effect, signed by the Mayor and other inhabitants of Notiingharo. Lord CARNARVON presented petitions from tho ratepayers and the Board of Guardians of the parish of Fulbam for the equalization of rates. The Earl of DARTMOJTH presented a petition from owners and occupiers of land, millers, maltsters and others attending the market at Bridgnortl, praying that corn may be sold by one definite weight, to be made compulsory throughout the whole kingdom. RATE OF EOXCANGE.-INDIA. The Earl of ELLENBORO UGEI said, he saw by the papers that the Directors of the East India Company had altered the rate of exchange at which they were prepared to receive funds in this country for bilLs drawn on the Indian Government. This alteration was merely a reduction of one farthing in the rupee, but it amounted to 2Ad. in the pound; and its effect had immediately been to create a reduction in the price of bar silver and dollars, which of late had been exported to a considerable extent to fndia. It might be that the Court of Directors hbd adopted this step at the suggestion of Her Majesty's Government, in order to check the export of silver to that country, which had been increasing to an alarming extent; but wrhether the step had been taken on this ground or, by offering snore favourable termns of remittance, to obtain a large accession of funds to the exchequer of this country, the ehffet upon the Government of ]ndi.a would be precisely the sameo. The revenue of India at the p resent moment was subject to three considerable dangers, the first of which was the nan-collection of the revenue. There could be no doubt that the largest portion of the country above Agra was In such a state that the diffieulty of collecting the revenue must he extremely great. In India no one paid if he could help it; and if it appeared probable thar there would be a deficiency in the means of enforcing payment the rovenue would not be regularly paid. More than that, large as was the cash balance of the Government of India, it was by no means accumulated in two or three places, but was distributed and separated in the various treasuries in India. He regretted that there was reason to believe the mutineers of Delhi must have obtained possession of a sum of 400,0001. or 500,0001 Hle did not say thab the whole of this sum belonged to the Government. The stuok of tho Delhi Bank must be included in it? but the largest portion of the sum must have belonged to the Government. These treasures were dispersed all over the country, and when the Government was understood to have a suffieient foxce at its disposal for their protection they were perfectly safehout when the contrary wvas the case, and when a state of tnsings such aS that which at present existed in India prevailed, there was ns O security that these treasures might not be seized upon by parties who wete anxious to enrich themselves at the expense of the Government. It was, further, the custom in lndia not to transmit money from place to place to any considerable extent by means of biDls, but by escorts of military, consisting of regular troops, and occasionally of police. Under present circomsstances the Government could no45 however, altogether depend upon the regular troops, and therefore eould not resort to them as a means of escort. It was therefore in the position of having to encounter great difficulties in the collection of the revenue, of being open to the inconvenience of having the money which was collected plundered, and of not being able to send it to the great centre from which payments were made, owing to the want of an escort on whiich reliance could be p laced. Bearing in mind thcee triple difficulties, he should entreat the Government to consider most carefully the question whether it might not he expedient to leave it to the discretion of the Governmenti in India whether they should remit or not the sums which might be necessary for excpenditure in this country. There might be eases of emergency in which it would be absolutely essential for the Goverument oE India to retain those funds in its own hands to provide for its own security, The GovernmenS in this country *-the Court of Directors-had other moans of supply, as, for instance, by the issue of fIndia bonds or by the asaistsnce of H er Majesty's Government, wiho, he believed., would be ready to lend their aid in carse of any emergency which might arise. His own immediate pred6cessor, as he understood, when the catastrophe which had taken place at Cabul had occurred, had called upon Her Majesty's Government not to require him to make remittances to this country for a period of two years. The subiect was one of no ordinary importance, and he wished, thereforeo eatnestly to call the attention of the Government to the question whether, by means of any extraordinary demand for the money to be remitted to this country, the Goverament of India might not he precluded from taking those steps wfhich, under existing circumstances, they might deem to be ahsolutely necessary. (Hear, hear.) lEarl GRAN VIL'LE assured the noble earl that the reduction in the rate of exchange was altogether attributable to the ordinary operations of combnerce. There was no fear of any undue drain upon the Indian Treasury, as the amount of bullion in the hands of the Governor-General wasant present 10,000,000h., while he had obtained a loan of 3,oo0,odoL.to meet any contingency which might arise. He, however, quite admaitted the importanc of the subject, and the noble earl might rest satisfied that the Government would take the neecsry'precautions to urevent the drain of money from India to any excessive extent, particularly unLder existing circumstances. ELECTION OF REPRESEN-TATIVE PEERS. The LORD CHANCELLOR, in rising to move a resolution with respect to the petitions of peers claiming a right to vote at the election of representative peers for Ireland, took occasion to observe that in those: -cases in which the heir to apecrago in this country applied for a werit to cnable him to tehiset in their lordships' Hiouse. the course taken was simply to apply-nkominally to the Crownbut practically speaking to the Lord Chancellor, who merely required that evidence of the marriage of the parents of the applicant should be produced, the expecnse of the whole proceeding amounting to froma 51. to 101. only. When, however, a person succeeded to an Irish peerage, and claimed not a seat in that House, hut merely to have a record ma2de of -his right to vote at the election of peers for Ireland, he had to pay, instead of 61. or 101., a sum amounting to between 1001. and 1501. That wFas a state of things which, in his opinion, called for a remedy, and the select commicttee which had last year sat to consider the subject had recommended that a measure should be introduced to Parliament witls the view of removing the hardship to which he referred. lie, however, having directed his attention to the matter, had come to the conclusion that it was not necessary to resort to legislation in order to accomplish that object. In ordinary cases there wvould be no more difficulty in determining who wras the heir in the case of a claim to vote for a reo,rcsentative peer than there wfould be in determining the heir of an English peer who had the hereditary right to a seat in that House, and he thought that it would be desirable to assimilate the procedure in the tw7o cases. The noble and learned lord concluded by moving that all petitions claliming a7 right to vote at the election of representative peers for Ireland, by virtue of peerages under wvhich a right to vote has been admitted by the Rouse of Lords of the united kingdom, he referred to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Kieeper ot the Great Seal to consider and report thereupon; and the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper is, upon such reference, to consider the matter of the said petition, and to make his report thereupon to~ the House. The Earl of DONOUGHMIORE complained of the burden which the present system cast upon Irish peers, and supported the resolution. Lord REDEBDAL^E said thaZt the present system was established by an Act of Parlia uent, which provided that no person should be admitted to vote for a representative peer except by their lordships' sanction, and that privilege was never allowed until after inuniry. The case of a peer of the united kingdom was different, inasmuch as it was not their lordships who admitted the claim to siit in that House, that claim being founded open the writ of summons. Hfe did not wish to st;and in the way of an alteration of the present system, but ho thought that it would be botter to proceed by a Bill which would be pasesd without difficulty than by a resoluhon. Theresolution wa8 then agpreed to. THE MURDER OF MR. PRICE. Earl TALBOT rose to move for the production of correspondence re-ative to the murder of the late Mr. John Price, of Mtelbourne, iBspector of convicts. He did not think it necessary to go into the details of this most barbarous transaction, Suffice it to say that Mr. Price was among the convicts in the execution of his duty when they set upon him and stoned hinm to death. From the best information whch he could obtain he thought there was no doubt that this offence was the result of a plan anong the convicts, and that they wore induced to carry this plan into execution by the false and morbid symnpathy which had been excitea by the-case of a man named Melville, who had committed a murder, bnti ws acqTuitted on a legal point. The jury at the iaquest found n verdict of wil£ul murder against 15 personc, and appendedto it an opinion, concurred in by all bmt two of their number, that " one cause of the unforinnate oecurrezce has been the misplaced sympathy exhibited by a poction of the public has by some reason become known to the priscaers." Ha thought that this showed a case for investigation by the .erecutivo Government, in order that pro. vision might'be made that the men should be properly guarded and kejt from infiasnees such as the.e. This unfortunate relative of 4ais had been 15 years in Norfolk Island, where his charaoter was unimpeachable, and where he verformed his duties with treat firmoness, but with great 3lziunesg. When the conviets were removed from Norfolk Island the same duties of ispection were imposed ap2n hint as he had formerly discharged in that colony. The feeling which existed with regard to this matter was shown 9Y a letter which appeared a one of the Melbo;;rne papers, in which It was stated that the conviots had obtained somem copies of the report of the citizens' committee, which was a lIf-constituted ody, which professed to inquire into the tte of the prisons, and also some of the journals containiDg the report of a public meetiDg at which Mr. Price was held up to public indignation ae a cruel and injurioas monster. The result of this wsa the production of much insuboydination among the prisoners, who alternately threatened andiJeered at the wardet6, reminding them of the citizens' commDittee, and threatening them with public indignatIden. at the inquest MIr. Blandford, the saperiatenlmont of tho Lysander hulk, said tbat on the day of the murder Mr. Price's manner was very kcind,-. almost fnthgrly. sInce the Melvill huaiess they had hnd a very dim(tult tnme; disciplino had been To. laXed- Mr. Pricel had mirade concessions, and the officers had 1est iontrol over the menl. On the day of the murder Mr. 1'Tic" was finrer than usual in refusing further conucssionsi, although he did it itn the muildest mnaumer. Ib was stato t that the oflicers were unarnmed, and the reason given for this vas that as there were only 12 or 13 men to coutrll ISO or 160 of tlhese desperate ruaffians, they wero afraid that if they carried arms tho convicts would soi7o thonm and turn. theui against themselves, He thought that the facts which he had stated were quitesufficient to justify hirn in moving for the production of this correspomdence, and in asking the Govermnont to givo an assurance that tle matter would be inquired into and justice done to the mnonmory of his late lamented relative, for whose vidow and six orphans he was glad to learn that the colonial Lcgislature had mado a handsome provision, and who had an additional claim upon this country owing to his havinxg married a near relativeoef Sir J. Franklin. The noble earl concluded by moving for the correspondence. Earl GRAiNVILLB was sure that their lordships would entirely approve the langnage in which the noble earl had spoken of this diabolical outrage. Tho Government had not the slightest objection to the productiou of this correspondence, which would give the detailsofithismost cowardly murldedr, taond would also exhibit the ircumstances which TRANSFER OF L&ND. Lord BROIUGHAM rose to call their lordships' attention to the ruinous expense imposed by the law with regard to the transfer of real property. He had the honour of pretenting a petition from Mr. Fawcett, a conveyancer of great eminence in the county of Cumberland, who, in conjunction with the late MSr. Aglionby, had been the anthor and originator of the Summary Jurisdiction Act. Mr. Fawcett in his petition detailed the great grievances under which landed proprietors and those who wished to become purchasers of land laboured in consequence of the state of the law respecting the transfer of real property ; he recommended a general measuro for the registration of titles, and he offered in support of it the results of his own experience. He states that in one of the largest manors in the county, containing some 400 or 500 tenements, of which he had been the steward for 30 years, nearly every tenement had been transferred bv sale or death. The deed of transfer in no case contained more than 190 words; there were no descrip. tions of parcels beyond the number of the tenement in the manor-book. During the whole time that he had been steward of that manor there never had been a question raised of boundary or identification of parcels, and the expense of transfer, whether it 'was of one or 100 acres, instead of being 6001. or 7001., had never amounted to more than 7s. This proved, at the very least, that a great and salutary change might be made in the law in respect to the conveyance of land. The Master of the Rolls, in giving evidence before the commission on this subject, said that our system of conveyancing, and, indeed, our whole law relative to the transfer of real property, was one which might have been devised exlressly to render land as little an article of commerce, and as little vendible and purchasable as possible. BiUs were sent down from this Hoose on the subject in the years 1852 and 1853, and in the latter year the subject was referred to a select committee of the other House. That committee recomroended that a commision should be appointed to inquie into the whole subject. That was done. and the comminion had jusb presented a report containing a mass of valuable information, and a number of very useful suggestions. Nothing could be worse than the present state of the law on this subject. Land, instead of being as easily transferable as bank-stock, was, owing to the principle and practice of our law, the most difficult article of transfer. n fact, it was in some cases actually impossible to transfer it. He therefore heartily rejoiced to hear that the commission had recommended the introduction of two most important measures with respect to this subject, and he should be glad to learn from the noble and lealmed lord on the woolsaek that these measures were in a state of forwardness. It was most judicious of the commLsssioners to recommend that along with a measure for the registration of titles, there should also be a measure for the improvement of the law respecting the transfer of land. Generally speaking, these important measures would meet -with no great opposition. There might be some difEculty with respect to the registration of titles, from the want of the proper charts and maps. The Select Committee had found that a great difficulty. Zeut the Tithe Commissioners possessed a great body of maps and charts, as did the municipal corporations, so that he would fain hope there might be found a sufficient body of maps and charts to render legislation eftectual. R e begged to direct their lordships' attention to the working of the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland. In the period of five years ending in 1854 no fewer than 2,400 cases wete tried and disposed of by that Court. Of these 1,448 terninated in sale, and the value of the property sold amounted to 14,133,0001,, there having been given in each case an absolute indefeasible Parlamentary title The cost of the whole proceedings was exceedingly light, but if it had been much larger it would have been as nothing compared with the incaloulable advantages obtained under the act. So much were these advantages appreciated that in many instances frauds were committed in order to bring property under the opration of the Act. Perhaps they might be called pious frauds, though on that point he was not callEd to give an opinion; but at the same time he might say that as he did not believe there was such a thin as a white lie, so neither did he believe there coild be a pious fraud. But, at any rate, frauds were committed. People trumped up debts-signed bils, for example, when there were no transactions, and made it appear that there were eneumbrances on property, so as to enable them to come within the scope and the advantages of the Encumborod Estates Court. Now, why should inestimable benefits like these be confinedito encumbered estates? Se thought there ought to be an extension of the principle of the Bocumbered mates Act to all cases-that principla to be carried ont by proceeding in the Court of Chancery, where a modification in the procedure now in force ought to take place. An indefeasible title was given to all laud purchased and sold under the Ordnance Departnent, compensation being given if within a certain period a claim was put forward for the land; and he saw no reason whv they should net go across the channel to Framce for an eiample of legislationx on this point. In that country the period of " limitation," as it was caUed, was 10 years, whereas in our own country it was 30, and irn many cases 40 years. It was no doubt suspicious to be asked to copy foreign institutions, but when those institutions were found to have groduced great good, as the laws regulating the transfer of and in Irelarnd, in France, Belgium, and America had done, it would be most improper not to avail ourselves of the examples which those countries afforded. He hoped the noble and learned lord on the woolsaek would be able to assure the Honse that Bills upon this subject were in a forward state, and would be speedily laid before Parhament. He would only add, that it was of the greatest importance that those who were intrusted with the drawing up of titles to property should possess a complete and accurate knowledge of their profession, and therefore he trusted that the Inns of Court would see the necessity of requiring all persons to undergo a comapulsory examination before being called to the bar. The LORD CHANCELLOR said the subject referred to by the noble and learned lord was as difficult as it was important, and had not escaped the attention of the Government. Soon after he reeeived the Great Seal, in 1853, he introdueed a Bill which tended to facilitate the transfer of land. That Bill passed their lordships' House, but did not become law, it havng been referred to a committee of the other House, which recommended the appointment of a commmisson to consider the whole subject. A Royal Commission was accordingly issued in 1853, but, although the commissioners had niot been idle, they were not able to pro. sent a report until the present year. In the meantime, however, he had prepared a measure which he believed would be found in harmony with the recommendations of the commissioners, and that Bil he hoped soon to be able to lay upon the table of their lordships' House. One of the greatest comnplications which were found in dealing with landed property arose from the imperfeeb manner in which charges upon such property were made. The BiU to which he referred proposed to substitute a more simple form for the present complicated system of mortgages and judgments, and to allow a declaration to be made of any charge given to any person upon any particular properby, and instead of there being contained in the same instrument powers of sale of appointing receivers, &c., as atpresent, he proposed that a mere chargoeupon land should containall the provisions which were now to be found in mortgage deeds. He also proposed that the Court of Common Pleas should establish a register of mortgagos, so that any one about to parchase or lend money upon land might ascertain exactly the charges wlich were upon It. He feared that the varied nature of our settlements and the various uses to which land was applied in this country rendered it chimerical to expect that the transfer of land could ever be made as easy as the transfer of bank-stock, but he thought, nevertheless, that great improvement might be effected, and he could assure their lordships that during the ensuing rece:s the subject should receive his fullest attention. Lord CAUPBELL expressed a hope that the laws relatin to real proper would soon be amended. He hadahopeg that he mightt have gone down to posterity as the author of aGeneral Registration Act, but that honour was denied him. Hef rejoied to ffnd, however, that the subject was again taken up, and be should certainly give it his moAt earnest support. Earl Fl;TZWIl LI ^EAM suggested that in addition to establishing a new form of conveyance all other forms should be rendered absolutely iUegal. Without an enactment of that kind any measure which might be passed would fail to cure the evil. He did not think that ic would be easy, even if desirable, to transfer land with the same facility as bankstock. The subject was thehi allowed to drop. SALE OF OBSCENE BOOKS' PREVENTION BILL. Lord CAMPBELL, in moving that the House go into committee upon this Bill, said that when he proposed the second reading he was so much surprised by some of the remarks that were made upon the measure that he made up hbi mind to abandon it altogether; but since then he had received such strong solicitations to proceed from various members of that House, fxom clergymen of all denorminatious, from many medical men, from fathers of families, and from young men who themselves had bsen inveigled into those receptacles of abomination against which his Bill was directed, and had suffered maost lamentably from that catastrophe, that he thought it his dty to persevere; and he had the hope that from the alterationsii the Bill which he would shortly state to their lordahips he would not meet with further opposition. Be was sure that the Bit was opposed in the first instance only from a misapprehension of its object. He had no desire whatever to interfere by legislation with books, or pictures, o., prints such as were described to their lordships _s being enmiangered by this measure. The keeping, or the reading, or t`he looking at such things must be left to jaste, and was not a subject for law; but when there were people who dehignedly ancd industriously manufactared books and prints witht the s;atention of corrupting the public morals, and when they sstcceeded in their infamous purpose, he thought it was necesS-ary for the law to interpose and to save the public-from the contamination to which they would otherwise be expsed. Hle now knew more certainly than he did .h±se htj~t «here were xgceptscles ~f the sale snd 0bslUtlion or tlhoem abolnomRblo bookg xna l prints, whliol lifi thme o(at lanmelntablo ei,oot, apid whialh thie lw anm It ,,tc(sil At present was altogether lntilll- lent to put dow,t.

Tlho Customs' officers, under tho powerst they posissesdri, hsd repVeatdly seized large importations of indecent bhooks and prints, but when ther once got Into EHoiywrelistrset they were secure, and the keepers of these ahoismlmmablo paublica. tions set decency and lawr at deflitice. If there woro tile samoe powers of searching ior the50 books as for ntounstomcd hooks the publie might 'bo relieved from these contaminations, lie had introdued sotne modiaficaiong into tho 33111. The operativo part consisted of two clauses: ong wag to empower justices of the peace, upon an affidavit being made that there was reason to suspoct that thee publications were kopt in a house for iale and exhibition to gant a 'warrant for searching- the other claoie empowored thte Chief Commissioner of 1olice, Sir Rt. Mayne, where ho had reasonable information that those books were kept, to grant a warrnt of the same kind. Ho believea that the liberties of the subject would be in no danger if Sir s Mayne had the sane power which wns pos sessed by the head of the police in every capitas in Eutrope. That power had, however, been objected to, and ho had been obliged to abandon this provision, which he did on the prinoiple that half a loaf was better than no bread. Into the other clause he haa introduced modirications which he trusted would remove all objections. The Bill, as it orig lly stood, only required an aflidavit that the person making it had reasonable ground to sUSpect that theso books 'were kept for sale and exhibition. The BiU as now amended required that the complainant should swear that he had reason to believe, and did believe, that these books or prints were kept in store for ale or exhibition. Another clause enacted that the complainant should set forth the Sacts on which he entertained that belief, and if the justice 'wero satisfied on these facts that the books and prints wore kept as alleged, he might issue his search-warrant, with this addional guard that he must be satisfied they were such books and prints as that their publcation would constitute a misdemeanour by the common law. There was also this further security, that the magistrate must not only be satisfied that the pubEcation of these books and prints was a misdemeanour, bnt a midmanonr 'which might be prosecuted by indictment. He had been asked vhat he proposed to do with these indecent publications. and he therefore proposed that after condemnation they should be burnt or otherwlse destroyed. HIe hoped their lordships would consider the peril to which the youth of this country were exposed from this source. He would not enter into details of the appaD§ng extent to which the sale of these publcations WbS carrTed, but would siove that their lordships go into committee on the Bill. The House then went into committee. Lord CAOIPBELL said he would ask their lordships to agree to the clauses pro f=ormnd in order that the amendments he had made might be printed. The LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that the Bill should miake it an indictable offence against the parht in whose possession these books and prints were discovered, if ajury found that they were kept for sale Lord CAMPBELL said it had been held by the Court of Queen's Banch that it was an indictable offence to have these books and prints in store for circulation, just as it was an offence to havo false coin in possession for circulation. He therefore held it mnnecessary to introduce such a provision, but if his noble and learned friend thought otherwise ho had nO objection to adopt the suggeetion. Thoclauses, as amended, 'were then agreed to without opposition, and the House resumed. The Sites for Workhouses Bill and the Charitable Uoes Bill were read a second time. The Grand Juries (Ireland) Act (1836) Amendment Bill, the Turnpike Trsts' A ngements Bill, and the Hanley Borough Incorporation Bill were read a third time and passed. The MIilitia (Ireland) Act (1854) Amendment Binl went through committee. Their Lordships adjourned at a quarter past 7 o'clock.

The House having been summoned to the House of Peers to hear a Royal Commission read, tho Speaker and a body of hon. members proceeded to the Uipper Chamber accordingly. On their return, the right hon. gentlemn announced that the Royal assent had been giren to several Bils (for which see Lords' Report). THAMES AND MIEDWAY CONSERVANCY BILL. On the order for the consideration of this Bill, Sir J. GRAHAM said that the Bill had for its object the compromise of the suit long pending between the Crown and the Corporation of London with reference to the right to the shores and bed of the river within the limits of that corporation. His attention had been directed to the mes. sure by a report of the Board of Trade with regard to it. He had previously expressed his strong opinion that the Board of Trade was the guardian of the public rights; and in the faithful discharge of its duty in that capacity, it was frequently brought into eollision with very powerful bodies. It had to make statements before committees of the House, and before the House itself, which were sometimes disagreeable to private parties and corporate bodies whom those statements affected. In this case, he believed, the Bill was not opposed. It went before a select committee, and along with the reference ta the committee was sent the report of the Board of Trade respecting it. Though this was a private measure, it ia volved two important points of public principle. The firsb had reference to the constitution of the Board of Conservators, and the second te the application of the funds ralsel from shipping by that body. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the first point, it would be recollected that a eommission sat io 1854, of which the present Colonial Secretary and the Chancellor of the BxcheqTuer were members. To that commission the question relative to the rights and charters of the Corporation of the City of London was referred and the subject of the conservancy of the Thames was included in their investigation. In their report these commissioners expressed an opinion-which was set forth in the report of the Board of Trade-to this effect:They recommended that the principal control of the navigation of the Thames should be vested in a board oomposed of the Lord Mayor, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the President of the Board of Trade, the First Commissioner of Works, and the Deputy-Master of the Trinity Honse. This Bill proposed that the conservators should consist of the Lord Mayor, two conservators chosen by the aldermen of the city, four chosen by the Conwmon Council, and he believed it was proposed that there should be four or five other members-the deputy-master of the Trinity-house, two or three nominated by the Government, one by the Board of Trade, and one by the Corporation of Trinityhouse. It would be observed that in that composition the corporate element cf the city of London vwould at all timea havea preponderating influence. The commission that had sat upon this subject recommended that those to whom the management of harboars and all matters relating thereto might be intrusted should possess the requisite knowledge for a due performance of that duty, and,above all, that they should be responsible for its due performance. The Board of Trade had stated that this Bill would, in fact, leave the Government nominees in sach a minority as to give the whole of the real power to the city corporation, while it would be less responsible hereafter for the exercise of its power. But there was another principle in the Bill, hardly wsimportanttud that as to the conservancy,-namely, the appication of the fands to be levelled on shiepidg. The Bill woruldimpose a newtol on steamers plyig on the Thames. The commission reported that the taxes levied by the consezvators othehe Thames should be either abolished or applied to harbour purposes. ln thelattercasethey would naturally form part of the censervancy fund. The Board of Trade had approved that recommendation, but the Bill not only did not adopt it, but provided that the surplus, if there should be any, of the general conservancy fund should boe apphied to purposes having no connexion whatever with a reduction of the dues. It was most important that these governing bodies should be as far as possible elected and no; nominated (hear, hear,)-elected by those who contributed to the fand, and not nominated by close bodies. Another great principle was that the dues levied on shipping should not be exacted to any greater extent than shipping purposes required. (Hear.) His right hon. friend the Htomo Secretary einbodied those principles in the BiU introduced by him last year with regard to the corporation of London. Bat this Bill appeared to him (Sir J. Graham) to be a departare from them, and he was anxious to hear an explanation from Her Majesty's Government why they had consented to that departure. He was pretty confident that there were pecular circumstances with reference to the compromise of the pending suit between the corporation and the C:own which justified the course-that had been adopted. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEEQUER trusted tbat Xhe shbuld be able to sat-isfy the House that no departure from tho principles laid down in the report of the Corpora. tion'eowomrnssion had been assented to by the Goverinent; andthat 'the -unily variation which had been asented to was one of deo(il, and not of principle. The arrangement em'bodied in this BO.1 was owing to a long-pending differenc3 between the Ca,'wn and the city of Lindon with respect to iA-s ri94t,5sf _h .gro Wu over the. bX ,ad !tD_ _ t!49 Thames. The Crown was advised tbat it wvas entitled to the bod and shorem of theThtmes, and to whatever revenue might acorue from leases of tho land between high and low water riiark. Praetically all the benefit of that land had amcrued to tlhe city of London, and tho receipts had been applied to tho conservancy of tho river. The city of London claimed tho property of tho soil of the river and tho right to the conservancy. The Crown asserted that the title to the bed nid shoros was independent of tho conservaucy. Those rival olaims led to a long litigation, which threatened to be ItloBt expensive, and an attesmipt was made in 1846 to. sittle tbo ilucAlon. In that year a conference took place betveen the noble lord tho mnembor for the city of London, who was then First X,inister, lord Morpoth, Ohief Commissioner of Woods and Foroets, and Lord Auckland, First Lord of the Admirjalty, tho resnlt of which was that a Bill for tho settlUement of tho debated question was agreed upon and a now constitution of tho conservancy board was also agreed upom, to comint of 15 coriaervators, 10 to ho nominated by tho corporation and fivo by tho Crown. In 1847 tbat Bill was introduced and oommitted, and recommitted, bat owing to tho lateness of the session it did not pass. Subseqttoent transactions took place with regard to the litigation, and attempts were tnade by successive Attorneys-General to bring It to an end. It remained, however, pending till the end of 18t session, and d nrlng the inquiry isto the corporation by the commisNion of which his right hon. friend, him. self, and Sir John 'attesotn were members. It was thought Ivery desirable that the litigation should be terrminated, In- asmxch es the conservancy of the river was to a great extent paralyzed from a Wnt of those funds which were applied to tho defence of the corporation againct the claim of the Crown. A conference took place between himself and Mr. Stuart Wortley, tho then Recorder of the city of London, and the result was an agreement, by which the city recogni7ed the right whicii it had previously contested, and the Crown consented to two-thirds of ihe revenies arising from the bed and soil of the Thames being paid to the Conservancy foard, the other third to be paid to the Crown. It was deteimined that the litigation should cease, that a Board of Conservancy should be crested, in which the Government, together with the Trinity-house. should be more strongly represonted than had bean previously agreed to by the corpration; that all the ftuds necessary for malntaining the conservancy should bo furmished, as heretofore, from the dues levied upon the port and. other sources of revenue accruing to the corporation; that the whole of the debt which was due for the portion of the river above bridge should be paid by the board; and that no liability should be accepted by the Government. It was also agreed that the portions above and below bridge should be consolidated, whereas previously they had been distinct. That agreement was embodied in a Treasury minute passed during the late session of Parliment. The first portion of I that minute deolared that- " The department of Woods, Forests, and LandRevenues and the Corporation of London shall complete the areement for putting an end to the suit as settled by the Attorney-General in 1854, according to which the right of the Crown in the bed and shores of the river, with the exceptions specified in the agreement, were to be granted to the corporation, as conservators of the river, upon trust to pay to the Crown one-third of all moneys arising from the bad and soil, and to apply the other two-thirds to the imptovement of the navigation and banks of the river." There was a further stipulation respecting the constitution of the board, and then the minute went on to say- " That the whole river should be under one management, and the funds of the two portions of the river brought into common stock, and placed at the disposal of the Conservancy Board, for the maintenance and improvement of the navigation, both above and below bridge." And it was further provided that- " When all the said revenues of the river are transferred to the new board, the board should take upon itself the burden of the existing debt, which has been incurredin the maintenancoe and improvement of the upper portion of the river."$ That debt at one time amounted to 199,900. but by successive payments it had been reduced by 69,OOv1., leaving a sum of .30,9001. now due. It should also be stated that the corporation of London had expended 50,0001. of their own money within the last few years in improving the navigation of the River Thates above London-bridge. Under these circumstanoes It seemed to be an advantageous arrangement for the Government that they should retain one-third of the revenue arising from the bhd and shores of the river, that the remaining two-thirds should be devoted to the improvement of the navigation, that the debt should remain a charge upon the Conservancy revenue, and that those sums which the city had been in the habit of bestowing from time to time upon the improvement of the conservancv should continue ta ha fn-iheA 4A.- their resources. The only remaining question was as to the constraction of the Conservancy Board. Now this bil certainly did not comply with the principle laid down by his right hon. friend-namely, that the board ought to consistof elected membersm It was thought better tha' there should be nominees both of the corporation and of the Government; that the corporation should appsint seven conservators, the Lord Mayor being one, the aldermen furnishing two and the Common Council four; that the Admiralty should appoint two, the Board of Trade one, and the Trinity House two. Con1sdering that the Government did not furnish any new funds for the improvement of the conservancy, it appeared to him that this arrangement gave them a fair share in the representation aLt the boatd. The principle which he contended for was that the Con. eervancy Board should not be exclusively a corporation board, but that tho Government and the Trinity Houe should be adequately represented there. This would not be a question of more preponderance of nambers as between the seven and five members nominated by the corporation and by the Government with theTrinity House respectively. Where a Government ws reprsonted at a board its meomnbers always obtained that weight and authority which naturaly belonged to their position, so that this was not a point or mere arithmetical proportion. If, however, it should be found on experience that the views of the Government were unduly overruled by the corporation membors, and that the interests of the public were sacrificed to any corporate interests, it woald undoubtedly be the duty of the Government representatives to bring the matter under the consideration of the Executive, who, if ther found that the constitution of the board asnowproposed was unsatisfactorv, would then feel called upon to adopt other measures. He confessed, however, that he did not anticipate any such consequtence, and believed that the board, as constitated, woald work satisfactorily. Mr. LOCKE KING moved the adjournment of the debate until this day week. Mr. W. VILLATS said that complaints had been made, and not without very strong reason, of the mismanagement of the Thames conservancy by the corporation. In 184, he remembered, a committee of this House was a;pointed to inquire into the subject, whose o wiaion was tnatanentire clange ought to take lace, an that the powvers vested in the corporation shouI' be handed over to persons holding high office,-for example, to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the President of the Board of Trade, the Deputy Master oE the Trinity House, and the Lord Mayor. He believed the Government at that time intended. to carry outthe recommendation of the committee bat there was some talk of a reform of the corporation and tbe whole thing was deferred. Now, he thought the same course should be adopted on the present occasion. They had been recently again promised a reform of the corporation, which for some reason or other had been delayed, and this question of the Thames conservanoy ought to be postponed and to form part of the measure contemplated, if, indeed, the Go. vernment had not altogether abandoned their intention to bring in such a Bill. Mr. LABOUCHERE opposed the adjournment of the debate on the gound that all the facts were before the House, and that hon. members were perfectly able to form an opinion on the merits of the Bill. For his own part, ho entirely concurred in the principle laid down by his ri6gt hon. friend (Sir J. Graham).. As a general rule, ho believed it was most important that all taxes levied upon commerce in this country shoald be devoted to etrictly commercial purposes, and should be expended under the managemenLt of an independent and responsible board. This general principle, he hoped, would not be lost sight of by the House, and any departure from it in the present instance could only be justified by the special circumstances of the case. Into these circumstances he should not enter; they had bean fully stated by his right hon. friend (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), who had proved beyond doubt, be thought, that in the present case they had to deal with a very complicated state of things and with circamstances of complete specialty, and that tbe Government were justified m the course they hadl taken. At the same time he shon I ,-be son2y if this course should lead the House to relax their adherence on future occasions to that which, as a general rule, ought always to be kept in view. Sir D. L. EVANS said, that he was in the position of four-fifths probably of thne members of the H'ouse, and knew nothing of the provisions of this private BilL Before the House decided upon passing it they should know what powver of taxation it conferred upon the corporation, and they should also take care that the corporation levied no more upon shipp?ing than was actually required for the conservancy of the river. There might be clauses in the Bill to meat three points;but the House should have time to investigate the matter, and he should therefore vote for the adtjournment of the debate. The CHANCELLOR of tho EXCHEQUER did noS understand that the Bil conferred any new powers upon the board of levying taxes. According to the last retura he found that the amount expended upon the conservancy of the river in one year exceeded bj 2,8441. the amount received from dues; and under the BiUl the corporation would supply the deficiency from independent sources, as they had done hitherto. Mr. HENLEY did not see that any advantage would arise from adjourningthe debate. The Bil Lwas the result of l2orl3years'litigationbetween the city and the Crown with respect to certain rights. So far as he could see, the new Board of Conservancy appeared to be fairlyconstituted, and he did not think it likely that there would be any jobberv, either on the part of the Crown or of the corporation. Under the circumetancee, he was of opinion that the rrangement would be beneficial to all paties, especialy as under the Bill the corporation were bound to ly out evers y shillng that they received in the shBpedof dues for the conservancy of the river. | Sir J. GRAinet suggested, as the adjournment of the debate wnold impede the p rogress of the Bill, that the opinion of the Hiouse should be taken upon the third reading; Iand i the mcantime he hoped that hon. members would read the report of the Board of Trade on the measuwre as it stood. (Hear, bear.) He thought that the constitution of the Board of Conservancy wras objectionable, inasmuch as it gave an invariable standing majority to the corporation. It wvas moreover at variance wiith the recomme.ndation ot twro Cabinet Ministers-the Chancellor of the Exchequeer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies-and with the measure introduced last session by the Government, which adopted the recommendation of the commission, and named. a nomlnated body, in which the corporatien had only one representative, in the person of the Lord layor Hle had not studied the Bill, except through the report of the Board of Trade, but, as be understood it, there waUs ia it a new power of taxation upon shipping above bridge, and upon all steamers plying between PtLtney and Teddington. Tbprc w 4 also applivation of 'F 20lus arising fromn fues3, which he thought was objectionabe Thle Board or Trade recommendd that it the surPlus increased the dUe. should be lowrered, but the Etil applied it i-n anUother Way.

SHEILLEY asked the Government to glve all :s8urance that the third reading should not be fixed for an. earlier period than that day week. sir G. GitEY said, that no doubt it was desirable to give. sufficient time for the consideration of the report of thee Board of Trade to which his right hon. friend had referred. The Bill was not a Government Bill, however, but was pro. moted by one of the members for the city of London. Sir J. DUKE assured the House that the corporation intended this Bill to confer a benefit upon the niercantiles claes and upon the pablic generally, and if he did not be.. lieve that that would be its object he should give it no supn port. The corporation had expended no less than 50,O00. beyond their receipts in the improvement of the riverThames, and they were willing to provide that sm out cE their general income. They desired to work cordially with, the Trinity House, with the Board of Trade, and with theGovernmient; they had no corporate interests to serve in. the matter, and their only work was to irmprove the navigaation of the river, and to confer a benofit upon the commercial interests of the city. If the BilU were read a secondh time he would have no objection to appoint the third reading for Tuesday next. If he delayed it to a later neriod theD Bill could not be introduced into the House of Lords thi£; session. (Hear, hear.) Mr. L KING then withdrew his amendment. The Bill was read a second time, and the third reading was appointed for Tuesday next. TEWKESBURY ELECTION. Mr. B. ELLECE reported that the committee appointed to. inquire into the allegations of the petition complaining of anx undue election for the borough of Tewkesbury had come. to the determination that John Martin, Esq., was dulrv elected to serve in Parliament for that borough. NOTICES OF MOTION. Mr. DISRAELI gave notice of his intention to move forcertain retarns respecting the annual value of all real property assessed under the income-tax on Monday next. Mr. IL BERKEELEY gave notice that he would on the, me ay pat a question tothe Secretary to the Treasry respecting the employment of the steamer Oneida to convey*nails between this country and Australia, notwithstandiug; that the First Lord of the Admiralty had stated that thasteamer had been condemned by the Government surveyor. He would also ask whether it was true that the payment of 270,000& a-year to the West India Mail Company was to bo. continued for two years beyond the existing term, if they consented to amalgamate with the European and Aistralian Stea- Company, the owners of the Oneida t MDIA. Sir T. COLEBROOXE gavo notice that on the nesl; supply night he would call the attention of the House to the, Iadlequacy of the reinforcements proposed to be sent out to India. Lord C. HARILTON asked the First Lord of the Traasury whatday he would give for the conclusion of theIndian debate, the adjournment of which on the 23d oE June was agreed to by the President of the Board of Control on the ground of the great immortance of the subject! The recent intelligence from India aad greatly increased the0 interest felt in the subject, Lord PATERSTON said that his right hon. friend consented to the adjournment of the debate, not solely on account of its importance, but mainly because the hour was. too late for its continuanoe. He did not see the connexiom. betwen the unfortunate news which had recently arriveds from India and a motion for the promotion of the growth, of cotton there, but he was afraid he could rnot comply with-, the noble lord' desire to have al day named for the resumption of the debate. There were many Bills of great importance to be forwarded, and many votes in supply to bediscussed, He was afraidt therefore, that thosew ho wished.- -xw - -wug muu uuaUw in queseson musut lin a day forthemselves. ("H ear," and a laugh.) REPORT ON SOLCECE AND ART. Sir D. NORREYS asked the Secretary to the Treasurya why the fourth report of the Department of Science anct Art had not been issued to members with their vote as irn previous years; why it was not issued before the lst day>of July (and then only on special application at the office for the sale of papers), the estimate for the Denartment of' Science and Art having been voted on the 20th day of June; and whether arrangements could not be made tohav&the fature repors of the department issued. to members at such a period of the session as should allow examinatior, of the report previous to the estimate for the department; being voted by the B ouse?s Mr. WILSON said, the delay in presenting the paperarose from some mistake in consequence of the Departmenti of Science and Art being in the present year transferre from the control of the Board of Trade to that of the Boarca of Education. The reason why the paper was not issued trmembers was because the Printing Committee had decided that papers presented by command, and belng of ,-, voluninous nature, andnotinmany ases of general interest, should not be distributed like the otber Parliamentarv. papers, but sbould be given to members on application. Sir D. NOR REYS thought it desirable that some notie of the papers presented by command should be given to. members. Mr. WVILSOX thought so too, and suggested that a list of those papers should be distributed to mezabers. ORDN*ANCE SURVEY OF SCOTLANSD. Sir D. NORREYS begged to ask the Secretary to tha Treasury when the supplemental estimate for the ordnuanc>survey of Scotland would be presented to the House, and whether any orders or instructions had been issued to thee Ordnance Department iu respect of the scale on which, the survey of Scotland and England was to be drawn in- Mr. WILSON believed the estimate would be presentea to the House within a fortnight. With regard to the. second question of the hon. baronet, he begged to state that after the decision at which the House arrived the other evening the Treasury received from the Ordnance Department a letter requesting to be informed what course they thould pursue. £be Treasury replied to the effect that ir. accordance with the decision of the Hoase all future works -which were not now actually commenced must be dravn. upon the 6-inch scale, and so long as the House continued to. entertain its present views that course would be implicitly followed. In order, however, that hon. members night be satisfied on the subject, he had moved for the produition of the letter from the Ordnance Department, and the -eply oE the Treasury, and he believed they would be in the lands ol; hon. members to-morrow morning. (Hear, hear.) CONlUMCATION BETWEEN LONDON \ ND DUBLI.N. Mr. CORRY begged to ask the Scretary to the Ireasurr whether the Government had accepted the conditi ns ot a contract for an improved postal and passenger conmunmc3. tion between London and Dublin ? Mr. WILSON hoped that an arrangement had at last beer. effected on this sub3ect. Only one point still remaired to be settled, and he could not believe that there woull be anr difficulty in concluding a satisfactory arrangernentbetweer. the North-Western Railway Company and. the Pat-office. He would in a few days be able to lay the formal caiditionc of the contract upon the table, but the outlines o' the arrangement were that four vessels of 300 feet in lngth, of 1,700 tons burden, and of 600 nominal horse power capable of working up to 3,000 horse power, sboald be prolded for the Service, so that the passage would be performd withiu. 34 hours. The whole journey between London ara Kings. town was to be performed in 11 hours, and betweea London and. Dablin in 1lW hours each way. Tho periods d arrival and departure would be stated in a minute which me hoped to be in a condition to lay upon the table in the conrse of a, few days. Mr. VANCE inquired when the new arrangement T,oul3 come into operation? Mr. WILSON's reply was rendered inaudible Iy a burst of laughter, occasioned by the circumstance that, when $he hon. member removed his hat, two or three scraps of papeL -the remnants of some torn-up letter or memorandumremained. entangled in his hair. The gravity with which. the hon. gentlemsan-nconscious that be was the cause of this hilaritjy-gave an anser to the hon. member for Dublin, and. then resamed his seat, increased the merrianent of the House. TRBEATNIEN' OF LUNATICS. Mr. DRTUMIIONlD asked tbe Secretary of State for tbe Home Department what report he had received froxa the Commissioners of Lunacy with regardl to the eomplaint of' Thomas Tilley, that he had been confined in an iron jackes in a dark room for seven weeks in the Beverlev Retreat for Lunatics near York, to which commilssionersthe sad coij. plaint ws sent for investigation? Sir G. GREY said,-Several month v he received ab complaint of the treatSment to which homas Tilley baa been subjected in the Gate Relnisley Lunatic Asylum, near York, which he referrd. forthwith, according to the usua1 practice, to the Commissioners in Lunacy for the purpose of investigation. Two of the commiussion1ers were imme.ael deputed. to make a faul inquiry into the case, and they reported the result to the hoard. The beard sent him extracts from that report; but a copy of the entire report vith mninutes of the evidence was tent to thel commnittee of visitors of the asylum. The extracts received. bybira con-I firmed the statements as to the use, in the case or ti,i e patient, of means of rtestraint and other treatment which the commissioners strongly conLdemned.. but it did. not appear that the confinement had been iana dark root, or had lasted. so long as seven. weeks.

Euch an affair as the Indian Mutiny was not Eikely to pass without some malicious comments 'from our ill-wishers abroad. The Continental nTations have, indeed, for the last few years ,been more sparing than usual of their taunts -and their prophecies of evil. The great pro4gresS of this country, the settlement of all the difficult questions which agitated it, the pacification of Canada and Ireland, have deprived the declaimers of other countries of their most fruitful themes. Coincident with this has beenthe overthrow -of liberty inFranc-and the return to a system of nbsolute government izore rigid than that of the ,pre-revoiutionary Bounnoii,. So, of late French -and German journalists and' :amphleteers have hardly had the boldness to abuse ub- and England has ratLer become the object of praises,which are intended to be as darts covertly aimed at 61spotic =futhority. But religious animosity knowrs neither .prndexice nor taste. While the Republican press acknowvledges the wisdom "and moderation of this scountry, and the injustice . of. its. own former philippice,-while the Imperial press has nothinp -to say against a nation wlhichls is te chief home of order in Europe, the Univers and one or two kindred journals never* lose an Qpportunity of -assailing us with all the stealthy hatred which animuates its clerical politicians against a country -which is at once free and heretical. The last proof of this feeling is given in it& xemarks on the Mutiny of the. Bengal Army. The Unsiern does not see in this affair merely the rage ' .f woun;led superstition or the impatience of long inaction. It attributes the Mutiny to the general dislike of British rule which is felt ~by men of .ll races and nations. It is the old notion of S Biitis'l DLilord going over the world tfrannizing snd exturting, treating dependent natives with ievery indignity, and returning to .eijoy hinself at Lsome, sf) far ai fog and spleen will allow him. The Z7nivfr1S seeins to have, learmt uothing since 1815, Snd its present style is pretty much the same as -tat in which the journals of the first Empire 'were accustomed to rail at the Carthage which ihey so bitterly bated. The English,"on account vof their haughtiness and stiffness; says . the .lerical journal, have never succeeded in. obtaining the sympathy of the populations with ,Whom they have come inito contact. The :Frigh are fbrced- to 'crdg the locean to be free S.Com their oppressors,' and yet even in America there is enough of English disdain to preserve the antipathy between the conquering and conquered races. As the British have only looked on India as a rich and fertile country from which they might draw the wealth they, covet, the Hindoo naturally hates the Englishman as much as the Celt does the Saxon. The present revolt is a proof of this abhorrence. Nor is the danger a light one. The Sepoy'is not what he was some years since, the resignation and passiveness which formerly distinguished him have passed away, and we may find in him a terrible enemy. Of course, from these premises 'it is argued in the usual manner that England is menaced with a fearful reaction and with a terrible decline. Now, as to the decline and ruin, we can: assure the Univers that the English nation is quite easy on that point. The wholechorus of malevolent spirits -Absolutist, Fusionist, or Democratic-have for years been singing a prophetic dirge for this country, yet we find nothing to justify their claims to foresight. Every year the British Empire is extended in territory, becomes more populous, more wealthy, more united, and nmore able to hold its own against aU foes, foreign or domestie. This Indian Mutiny will be put down with a strong hand, and in a few months will be forgotten, except as a guide for future policy. But there is one point on which we may condescend to argue with this French journal. The Univers tells 'us that the English have not the faculty of obtaining sympathy from other races, and ascribes by implication this' amiable quality to its own countrymen. But how stand the facts ? What have been the histories of the two nations for the last o50 years ? Briefly, the French have been sooner or later driven out of every country in which they have established themselves, while the, English have added conquest to conquest, and, with an army of small numerical force, govern a sixth part of the human race, and possess settlements on every poin' of the globe. As to the sympathy of foreign nations, we would ask what are the sentiments with which the rule of the French is remembered in any of the countries which they once possessed. In fact, it is notorious that, however attractive Parisian civilization may be for the idle and the wealthy throughout Europe; 'yet the French, as a people, have been far from inspiring any feelings of sympathy among those whose country they have occupied, whether cultivated or barbarian. In regions where the British arms have triumphed, such as India, Malta, Egypt, Portugal, and Spain, the result has been in no low degree owing to the desperate hatred conceived by the people against the French during their term of power. Indeed, the Frenchman has always been a hard master, domineering too openly, maldng changes too abruptly, wounding prejudices too wantonly. Even in Turkey, during the last war, although the SuLTAN owes almost everything to France, yet the Orientals have been inspired with the mostbitter resentment bythe cavalier behaviour of Frenchmen both high and low. The English, on the contrary, have pre-eminently the gift of attaching half-cultivated races to them by the vigour of their character. Whether it be among'the Hindoos and Mussulmans of India, the Turks on the Danube or in Anrenia, the Arabs of the Euphrates, or the Caffres of Southern Africa, the Englishman has always managed to establish an ascendancy wbich, though it may at times be struggled against, is not the less irresistible and permanent. CLIvE at Arcot, SvDmnv Szrrmr in the breach at Acre, SALE at Jellalabad, EDWAaPES in Upper India, WILAMS at Kars, have given proof how much mnoral power 'is possessed by the Englishman in his dealings with half-civilized' natures. Within the last few years some of the most stubborn races "of Asia have been conquered by our arms, and it -is strange,e even 'to those' accustonied to command, to see how effectually these have been aftachedV 1 thei -ofd good feeling to British atItloity. ' It it oily.siome 15 years since Sir C. NAP.Er. beat the Beloochees, and now Beloochees form part of the Persian expeditionary force. The *Ghoorkas, who nearly cut to pieces an English' regiment in one of their bloody battles with us, now use their sabres against our. own foes. The same may be said of the Sikhs, who burst on our frontier 100,000 strong some eleven years ago, andl were not finally subdued til 1849; and yet we find them now among the most zealous of the Indian army. Even this very Mutiny brings to light the respect and confidence which our rule inspires. The- tributary or friendly Rlajahs, the Zemindars, great and smail, the inhabitants of the towns as well as the peasantry, have shrunk from -joining the in-. sane outbreak, and no doubt will do their part in putting it down. So, let our continental detractors be eileat on this theme, for it is one on which the experience of a hundred years shows that their views are as erroneous as their spirit is malignant. Whatever may be our defects, inability to govern men is not among them.
The Act which has been receiitly directed against Corrupt Practices at Elections deals -with an offence which is therein described as " undue influence." This offence is considered in point of enormity as the equivalent of bribery or treating, although the penalties are not precisely the same in the three cases. Now, there may be some little difficulty in giving a* definition of " undue influence" sufficiently coraprehensive to meet all cases which might occur; but at least when particular instances of intimidation and undue influence are brought before us it is not impossible to say whether they do or do not fall within the purview of the Act. For example, if a landlord threaten to evict his tenant unless he vote against his conscience and his own private political viewss, and the tenant accordingly, under duressj gives *the vote as directed, here is an obvious instance of the exercise of undue influence. So, if a voter be threatened with any kind of temporal loss, anad is so induced or compelled to record his vote against his convictions, here again is " undue influence:' If this be so, how much more heinous is the offence whexi the terrors of the spiritual world are brought to- bear upon the ignorant voter-?when the curse of the ALMIG=TY is invoked upon his head from the altar-when he is informed that his soul will . be consigned to everlasting misery, unless he blindly obey the directions of his priest I This is surely " undue "ini3uence" in its most outrageous, in its most mischievous, in its most debaing form. We care not' by what ministers such influence may be exercised-be they Clergymen of the Church of England-be they Presbyterian Ministers of Scotland-be they Roman Catholic Priests of Ireland, .-this is an oppression which cannot be borne, this is an electoral abuse which must be washed out, or our boast of freedom of election is a miserable imposture, We tie up the riCh man's hands; we wliU not permit the employer of labour or the owner of the soil to dictate to his dependents how they shaU record their votes; we will not permit the Government of the day to, strengthen its.hands by tho promise or the'gift of place or preferment; nay, we forbid the. offer of a crust of bread or a draught of. beer to a voter .even 'when it is not pzetended ..that this humble refreshment.. is given for the' purpose of influencing his vote - and, shall --ine influence alone be excepted from the scope of our "' self" denying oidi4anci--the iRueuce, ntamely, of tlie prtest and th, terrors oS superstition2 This is not to be bor v. The wo~ of the taU ote are very express to ghow: that such was not the inten. tion df the Legislature. It only renaauins "to be' seeff if the law is to be put iti force against 4hose -who have transgressed its provi ons, and who, by) the voice of one of their most notable leaders;, express their determination to set it at defianco, and to trangress'it again wherie-'er opportunity shall occur. Thei paiticular instance at which'we would point in illustration of these remarks is the recent election for the county of Mayo. An inquiry'into all the circumstances connected with this election is now pending before a Parliamen Cox - mittee, and upon the particular facts which have been brought 'out -in the:, . ourse of examination, either for or, against Mr. G. H. MooEx, we have no wish to offer 'any remark' until the inquiry 'i, concluded. By the judgment of the judges appointed by Parliament let him stand or fall. If it be provedto the satis-~ faction of the Committee that the majority obtained by Mr. MoosiR over Colonel HIGGiNS was the* result of spiritual terror and -of priestly interference and denunciation, they can arrive but at the one conclusion. If, on the other lhand, it be established that the. charges of this kind which have been preferred against' Mr. MooRB are destitute of foundation, it will be most just and most proper that he should retain' hiirseatt and that his opponents should be muileted in-the costs of the inquiry. We state the -issue and there we leave it, as far as the individual member is' concerned. It is, however, quite an'othei matter to discuss the general 'theory of' priestlynfluenw-.- what-is its legitimate scope, and to tliat extent it may be carried according' . the views of a Romai Catholic Archbishop. Dr. 3l?HALYs was examined before the Committe eboth yesterday and the day before, and here is his opinion upon the point under' discussion :-"The consciences of "the peasantry should be in' the keeping of' the' "ministers of' religion. The lan'dlords have no "rigbt to exercise a control over the consciences "of their tenantry. Their consciences sliduld "be i left' to themselves, to 'their G'oD, aud' "to the yIriers. They ought to be subject' "only to the influence of religion." If this view hold good it would be by far the shorter method to- get rid altogether of the clumsy and cumbrous machinery of the hustings and the poling-' bo6th. ' Let us simply require that the priesthood of the three IEoinan Catholic'provin;ces of Ireland sball remit, from time to time, a certain' number of nominees as their representatives to the Imperial Parliament, and so we may avoid all the turmoil and violence of an Irish contested election. We do not, howvever, aim at anything so 'visionary as an attempt to destroy altogether the influence of the Roman priest over the Irish peasant. With the machinery of the confessional and the terrors of the spiritual world at his disposal, the priest will be sure enough to bring 'an enormous amount of influence to bear upon the ignorant voter, which we could never hope to counteract by the enactment of any positive law.. In the same way the influence of the landlord upon the tenant will surely make itself felt, although no overt act be committed which 'could fairly bring the landlord under the operation of any particular statute. These things must be, and we' have no wish to see the Legislature losing its time and injuring its dignity by tilting at windmills. But when thb priest steps out from the' twilight of' his confessional into the broad sunshine,; when he no longer whispers 'but vociferates damnation; when he is found at the head of a tumultuous' rabble, directing them when to commit and how to commit acts of violence againt' the members 'of that political. factio -which is not ' his own; when, in short, blasphemy under the form,of political partisanship la.4done its wo'6ratii' the sight 'of 'all' men-then; we sagY it is right that if therebe any law in exiden86VhidcdE can' check such procebdings it should be instantly! awd strentously' put into force, and, if theie be no 'law, then that one should be made for the repression of so crying an evil. It may be that the endeavour to suppress bribery and treating altogether amounts to Quixotism, and ican never be carried out in practice; it 'may alAo be that nothing the Imperial Parliament. can do will ever emancipate the Irish peasant altogether. from the thraldom of his, priest. The crusade against bribery and corruptioh, however, has most in'doubtedlyg checked the evil as far as Great Britain is concerned. 'In the same way, if every Irish -election in whiclh a priest, as priest, has openly meddled be annulled, and every priest who, as priest, has threatened and coerced the' voters be punished according to law, we should hope that this shameless and unconstitutional interference with the purity of election may be much mitigated, if not extinguished altogether. The harvest must surely be ripe for the sickle. If it requires such strenious efforts on the part bf the Roaman priesthood in Ireland to compel the peasantry to vote according to their views, with a little further effort the peasantry - might be liberated altogetherfrom sO debasing aslavery. At anyrate, in this case of the Mayo Election, supposing that the charges :'which have been made against Mr. CoNwAY and 'other priests be established to the satisfaction "of the Committee, it' would be worth while to try' if there be any virtue in the recent Statute.
It appears, notwithstanding Mr. LOCKE KIWG'S excusable scepticism, that there is at last some prospect of a compilation of the Statute Law. Several able lawyers are employed on the details of the operation, one or two Judges give their active superintendence, and Sir FITzRoYE KE=Y is doing his best to eatn the honorary column which Baron WATSON somewhat hastily promised to erect irk his honour on the completion of the' undertaking. ParJiament may perhaps entertain some scruples as to the expediency of re-enacting a mass of laws which in many instances require considetable improvement ; but, on the whole; it will probably appear desirable to adopt the proposals of the Comnniissioners. The new code of Statute Law. will possess some bistorical or ant.quarian interest, aind. it is by no means impossible that it may in ma y instances be found practically'usefil. The greatest advantage which- is likely to result from the labours of the. Commission consists in the prospoct that a. similar process may be. applied to the whole system of English law. Even the LORD CHANCELLOR has been induced, for the fist- time, to express.an opinion in favour of the possibility of a code. As Sir ROBERT PEEL advanced from a repeal of the duties on' diindivi to the abolition of the Corn Laws, LoPd C - WORTH .will, perhaps, find that the consolidation of the .Statutes proves that a comprehensive system of law is not altogether unattainable. A partial codification is valuable when it exhausts a particular subject, as an index' to a single chapter in a book may.be useful, although it furnishhe ng guidance to the remaining c6itents of the work but a consolidation- of a part-of.the law.applicable to persons or things is essentially incomplete.'arid unsatisfactory.

The judgment ofthQ e use o w. Lords will finally decide ,the difrficlty, bn i~ 1AS evident ,that: Mr. 1)NB KEga?s consQI:lidatiou of the Statutes. will,furnish, little assistance to future didates. The law exists in theAct, as the statue in the block of marble. The decision f {Ma competentpourt. is necXsarvy. 'before the des,t,ine,d f,ornm is 'nade visi3ble,toithe world. For all practic,al purposes.the Statutes have: long. Aince been sufficiently accessible. Buuijs and, ABcBOD' have. redpced the criinaial law into a Veasonableco.mnpass.. C = "and others have. inchided in a few volumes all th,e Statutes which are 'iiely to concern a practitioner. -The more com:pleut9 -work of the Commission will. form.the raw material of. that portion of, the . law which. "is 'Bontained in legislative. eruactments. The 'constfi~ctiop of -a .ode only awaits the deci, sionl Qf a resolute Mnistr. . The..possibility of .the tas,s, in itself abundantly. evident, lan been .proved.by the success of France, of other Conti*neiital nations, ,and of the several.American States. On a limited scale the worklhas been effectually accomplished in certain portions of our own legislation : The Customs Act and the Merchant Shipping .,Act contain. the substance of s,everal hundred Statutes, and at the .same time. em,body, the decisioas of . competent tribunals on. all. disputed questions. The large sections of the comrmunity whom these Acts concern are perfectly satisfied with the operation. which compresses al necesqary regulations within the liiits pf. ;a pamphlet., The sucicess of the undertaking is owing to the special .naature of. the subject, and to its exclusive bearing on the mercantile and 'official clases. If the proposed reform had been thought legal rather than commercial, the LQBD CuE.ucmron: would. have de-, .lared that it was impossible, or at best that it was premature. 'I-t is by. no. means certaiu that the formation of the code would be accelerated by the croation, of a Mhinistry of Justice. There is an anomaly in the appointment of an executive fbAnctionary exclusively for purposes of legislation; and it is a 'mistake ,to, provide a uew.. departraent *-for e'ety new duty which. may arise. *6demn experience has not, proved that. the multiplic4tioxA of officials teuds to the effective transaction of business. .

The truth is, that saubordinate Ministers are never intrusted with sufficient power to accomplish their nominal duties.

DEATH OF; TaEBARL -OF MORNINGTON.

The marriage, as our readers are doubtless, aware, was anything' rather thinuhappy inito consequences to the lady, who died in 182e, leaving her husband with two sons and a daughter. In 1828' Mr, Welleley P'ole re-married, his second 'wife being- the 'daughter'of Colonel Paterson, and widow of Captain T. Bligh, of the ColdstreAi Guards. This second union would appeartto have been no better assortedthan the first, to judge from the fact that since her husband's accession to the title Lady Mopnington has repeatedly, appeared in our columns as an applicant for relief at the metropolitan police-courts in consequence pof having been* left destitute by hef husband and chargeable to the parish.

SECOND EDITION. TIA TIMES-OFICE &Sairday Morminq. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. M. The following is the letter of our Paris corrapondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:-. The Mlinisterial and Legitimist papers keep up their fire against the Jourl des D8bats for its temporary association with the Sik2e, and its adoption of a list of candidates for Paris in which, among several Republicans, figures M. Darimon, the friend and disciple of Proudhon, whose ideas on religion, I government, and property are too well known. It is superfluous to say that this electioneering movement of the great defender of the Royalty of 1830, of order, and of property, does not imply that it has embracod either Atheism or Conmnunism. Its brief coalition with the Sic&e was merely for the purpose of securing, through its asaitance, the return of two Liberal candidates. In order to attain so desirable an end, it has incurred the censure of some of its own party, as well as the attacks of the ultra-Royalst Journals. The Dlbaes has ever been opposed to coalitions involving a compromise of principle, and there was no more earnest opponent of the fusion between the younger and elder branches of the Bourbon family. The intention of the DAbats was good; it wished to Introduce an independent element into a subservient Chamber, - h-Al aucces, e-rowned its efforts it is certain that from that moment its passing connexion with the Democrats would cease. It has failed, and its failure has given additional vigour and bitterness to the attacks against It. In this species of warfare the Costitu,tionwel particularly distinguishes itself, and in one of it-1articles of to-day, touching i. Darimon, it notices several incidents in his previous career, in order to show that he has held doctrines much at vaiance with his present profesions. The foUowing are the dLi^overies of Darimon's political inconsirstenciers as given in the Cwnstittitiome .- " The Opposition, and so-called Liberal pasty, perists in presenting M. Dasimon to the electors of the 7th district. The rival of M. Darimon hasi asirificed himself, and the small number of votes obtained by A!L Bastide are offered to the publicist, who since 1855 ha, according to the si4cl3, 'given proof of undoubted aptitude in solving diffioult questions.' This praise of the aptitude of 3i. Darimon has naturally awakened the attention of the electors of the 7th district; and several of tho latter request us, without calling into doubt the authority of the Sikc, to make the following inquiries of the candidates of the democratic committee :-Was not IM. Datimon the fervent disciple of M. Proudhon, a fngitive of tho 13th of June ; the editor, in Paris, Ghent, Marseilles, and other places, of journals having genorally for titles, * Te People,' 'Tlce Voice of thc People," 'Fraler,ity,' or 'I e Labourer '? Was he not, we repeat, before 1848,editor, in Lille, of a Ministerial journal, and aecrotary of an ultra-Conservative, Dr. De Sablonville, the author of remarkable and practical works on dog-training ? Was not A. Darimon, when editor of the 'Peuple,' exposed to tho annoyance of seeing oneof his articles in favour of his now Ideas reproduced by a journal of the north of Franc4, alongwith one of hisbest defences ofthe Government of July, published in Lille ? Finally, did not M. Darimon, whose monarchical and eonserfativo principles were well known, experience much difliculty in convincing the Republican commissioners at Iille, MMKf. TestelRn and Thouret, of his democratic fervour ? These are questions whioh M!. Darimon may not consider worthy of reply, butt which, we tbink, ought to be noticed by the Presse. We, therefore, beg of it to reply. An answer is easy, if there is a confusion of names or persous; in a contrary case, the praise of the Siiclt reads so full of irony that tbo Pressc and the Opposition Comunttee are intrestck in repelling the allusion ." The foregoing may be perfectly correct, but what of that? There aro few plllic men in France, even of higher standing and greater note than M. Darimon, against whom chargges of a more flagrant character may not be brought; and of all the organs of publicity the on-titutr el is the least entitled to throw the first stone at the head of any political ainner. The 0onstitutionnel has tot, like its twin-brother the Pays,' the advantage of being sborn in the purple ;" it does not enjoy the title of Journtal Ae l'Em2ire, but it is, nevertheless, the outand-out supporter of the Imperial rggine; and will, I doubt not, continue to be so as long as the said repence is prosperous and powerful, but no longer. This readiness to reproach people with apostacy is somewhat dangerous; it is a pastime at which two can pLay. If the Con.sfitsctiom/nel takes the trouble of looking into the amusing and instructive publication, MlUsailes Rfeoludionnaires, it will find, at page 34, vol. 1, the following pithy adlress to the members of the Provisional Government of the Republic:- " The nation has just torn in pieces the treaties of 1815. The old soldier of Waterloo, the last brother of Nlapoleon, retires at this moment to the bom of the-great family. "The time of dynasties has passed away in France! "The Iaw of exile which fell on me is failen with the last of the Bourbons. I ask the Government of the Republio to declare it by prescription ag an insutt to France, and to have disappeared with all that has bsen imposed on us by the foreigner. Receive, gentlemen, members of the Provi. sional Government of the Republic, the oxpression of my respect and my devoteduess. " JEROMIE BUONPAR^BTE. " Paris, Feb. 26, 1848." The opinion is very generally entertained that the name affixed to the foregoing is that of hli Imperial Highnems Prince Jerome Buonaparte, the uncle of the Emperor. The Constitutions al wishes to be set right if it errs in attributing to M. Darimon the vaiious qualities it notices ; perhaps it 'would be good enough to enlighten the public on the present question. Again, at page 92, occurs the following ,TO TsHr MEMOBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENIET OF TIIE REPUBLIC. *At the very moment of tho victor y of the people I ropaired to the Hotel de Ville. The duty of every good citizen is to rally round the Provisional Government of the Republic, and I am anxious to b3 one of the first to do sotoo hAppy if my patriotism can be usefully employed. " Receive, Gentlemenr, the expression of the sentiments of respect and devotedness of Your fellow citizen. " NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. " Parts, Feb. 26, 1848." The Constitutionmel, I hope, will also remove the impresion that this document omanates from his Imperial Highness Prince Napoleon, cousin of the Emperor, Prince of the Imperial family, and stand ing near in succession to the Throne. And lastly (for the present), at page 103, occurs the following:- " Gentlemen,-The people of Paris having destroyed by itsheroisam the lastvestiges of the invasion, I rushfrom exile to taUe my place under the banner of the Republic whltich has just been procdaimed. Without any other ambition than tbatof saving my country,I have just announced my arrival to the members of the Provisional Government, and to assure them of msy dcvotedness to tle catse wkfch, thej represent, as well as of my sympathy for th persons. "1 Receive, &c., "NAPOLEON LOUIS BONAPATE." The readers of the MUraWlles droldtionnaires, and indeed the public, labouir under the delusion that this earnest declaration of love for the Republic and of admiration for the Provisional Government is from the pen of no less a personage than His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French himself. That stern moralist, the Constituftiotcl, wiU doubtlea hsten to dispel that error, and show that those aguKst names have been only assumed by others. If, however (but this is hardly possible), they are genuine, the Emperor wiU do well to give a hint to the Coawitutionnel not to be so apt to throw stones at other people, seeing that the heuses many of us l19 in-Are wade of very brittle saterial indeed. Tne SUde contains the following appeal to the f ott3d,4th, an&7tlA4i icts:- w'We ato co ment that the oawldAotionof Sunday and ]K**y ik vwill present a iap#aoaWle example of union and concorl Tho causes of dissension have vanished. The Opposiion ha but one name inschptnrict, and this name does not represent a man, or a shade of opinion, but all tho shades of opinion. Many voters who at the last election ab_ stained have since expressed to us their regret at not having taken part in the paoific contest, the result of which has been so important. Those voters will this time take part in the prooeedings. Let every one, we repeat, follow their example. The fruits of a fitst advantage must not be lost. The journals which support the Admistration redouble their efforts, and caU upon all their friends to vote. Oar friends will not be absent from the poll." The Piedmontese Gazette of the 30th ult. contains the following account of the attempt made by a party of revolutionists to gain possession of the forts in Genoa:- " The authorities had been iuformed for several days past that a few individuals were conspiring to disturb public tranquillity in Genoa, and they adopted the measures necessary to prevent any attack. Having received positive information yesterday that sone attempt would bemadeduring the night, dom iciliary visits were paid and searches were made, in consequence of which a quantity of arms were seized, and about 40 individaals were arrestedl They had endeavoured to obtaiu possession of the forts of Sperone and Diamante, bat failed. The telegraphic wires had been cut at Ronco. The city of Genoa is tranqu;l, and the authorities will not cease to adopt every precaution to protect the public peace, which, fortunately, has not been disturbed." On the same subject the Qpinione of Turin says:" A handfal of obscure men wanted last night to surprisg two forts at Genoa. It i9 said they were armed with pistols and carbines, and that they have been arrested. Twelve of them were to attack one of the forts; the attacldng party of the other was aomewhat stronger. Not a shot has been fired, and no one is wounded. This morning Genoa was lost in wonder at this nocturnal attempt. Everything is quiet, aud there has been no necessity for etraordinary measures." The following private telegraphic despatch, on the same subject, has been received - I MARSEILLES, JulY 3. "The packet from Genoa brings the news that the plot discovered on the 29bh was a Mazzinian one. About 200 persons have been arrested. Several thousands of muskets and stilettas, and a considerable quantity of ammunition, have been seized. The troops of the garrison and the navy are disposed to act vigorously." The following private telegraphic despatches have also been received:- " TRIESTE, JUsLY 2. According to accounts from Constantinople of the 20th of June, the Porte claims possession of the island of Perim and expresses a hope that this island will be evacuated b; the English. It is said that Mr. Murray had demanded to enter Teheran accompanied by a regiment of Indian troop3, but the Shah had refused." " TURIN, JULY 2. "The political prisoners escaped from the island of Pouza were 303 in number. "United with the insurgents on board the Cagliari, they attacked the Neapolitan gendarmerie in the province of Salerno, but they were dispersed, and many were arrested the rest fled." " MADRID, JuLy 2. "The law on the prers will be presented to-morrow. 'The Senate has voted the ]aw on constitutional reform. "A rising at La Carolina, in the Sierra Morena, has been suppressed." " MARSEILLES, JULY 2. "The Algiers journals of the 30th ilt. publish a despatch from the Governor-General, announcing that General Yusuf's division attacked aud carried, two days before, the village of Taouria, the last rampart of the Beni-Yennl, who bad there collected the contingents of all the insurgent ttibes." The Mfoniteur publishes decrees nominating Count de Moiay to be President of the Legislative Body; MM. Schneider and Reveil, Vice-Presidents; and General Baron Vast-Vimeux and M. Iterbert, Questors. The poet Beranger, who has been suffering for some time past from severe illness, was yesterday in such a state as to leave hardly a hope of his recovery. He is reported to be a little more free from suffering to-day, but it is feared that the relief is but temporary. The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 24th June amount to 1,038,645f. 44c., being an increase of 322,378f. 79c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts from Iche 1st January to the 24th June amount to 27,869,5O0f. 14c., being an lncrease of 6,268,673f. 45c. as compared with the corresponding period of last year.

TUp to the 24th ultimo no publication of the new tariff had taken place in any newspaper, and yet it came into force at any rate at St. Petersburg on the 22d. In an ukase, dated June 8, published in the Joturnal of Commerce, we read:- " Now that we have coDfiimed, and with all its appendices made it over to the Executive Senate, a new general tariff for the Ewropean com'merce of the Empire of Russia and the Kingdom of Poland, drawa up by the Ministry of Finance, and revised by the Imperial Council;We ordain :-I. The new tariff comes into force in the empire and the kingdom the same day as it arrives at any Customs station. The only exception from this is the Custom-house at Odessa, at which the goods entered for consumrption in theraayonof that free port will continue to be subjected to the same 'charges as before. 2. Goods, which, on the day of this new tariff arriving at a Custom-house, were lying there uncleared, will be charged according to the new reduced tariff; on the other hand, where the new tariff is higher than the old one, these goods will be charged aocording to the latter. The Executive Senate will not fail to carry out the proper measures." According to a St. Petersburg letter in a Hamburg paper, the following articles will be admitted duty free by the new tariff-unwrought jet, unDurified chalk, ali sorts of domestic animals, stones for grinding, polishing, or sharpening, paving, and for litho- graphic purposes, wrought fiints, onyx, cornelian, topaz, rock crystal, jasper, mosaics, gold and silver sand; printed books in all languages, bound or rabound, pictures, drawings, engravings, lithographic, daguerreotypic, and photographic impressions, carved ivory, silhouettes and bas-reliefs, pictures with automata or other moving figures, printed music and manuscripts, (lithographed stones with writing or drawing on them, printed music, pictures, lithographic drawings, books,: &c., are subjected to the laws of the Censorship ; when pictures are framed the frames have to pay duty) :-fish-skins, common basket-work made, of reeds, bast, straw, bark or shavings, foot-mats'Of the same material and sacks, articles of wood with very few exceptions timber, whether in slabs, planks, or boards, together with all joiner's work, emery, both in lumps and in powder, pumice-stone, tripoli; and other substances used for polishing, all species of baked bread, mother-o'-pearl, tortoiseshell, amber and l'tcutmo de mer, all kinds of sulphur and flowers of sulphur, and chicory. The new treaty of commerce concluded on the 14th ult. between Russia and France commence5 [by superseding the former treaty of 1846. The mise en signeur of this new one commences simultas neouily with the new Russian tariff coming into force. The sur-taxes, or additional Customs, levied on all goods that proceeded from any French Mediteranean port, as well as on all goods shipped under the Freuch flag in a foreign ship are done away with. Natives of France are in future to be at liberty to possess real property in Rusia without their being necessarily naturalized. By a special article French trade marks are in future to enjoy a legal protection in Russia; and,finally, the principle is laid down for a convention for the protection of international copyright in works of literature and the fine arts. It is expected that Prince Gortschakoff will avail himself of his visit to the centre of Germany in the suite of the Emperor to take a trip to Vienna, for the purpose of bringing about a commercial treaty with the Austrian Emperor. Mr. Robert Torley King has received his equatutr as English Consul in MoscwW; Mr. BIathew as Consul-General in the ports of the Black Sea; and Herr Djellibrand as British Vice-Consul in Onega. According to a telegraphic notice in the Nord, the Grand Duke Constantine has been, by an ukase, nominated Regent during the Emperor's absence, v;ithPrince Orloff and the Minister of War (General Suchosanet) as coadjutors. A fresh expedition is apparently being proposed towards the Amoor region. A contract has been made for conveying 120,000 ponds of State property to the Mariuski post in 40 transports. A former contractor, who had sent out last August with about 30 men and a similar caravan,was very nearly lost, inasmuch as he was frozen up on his way, anI his provisions failed him. The Addmiralty at Archangel has just launched a new screw frigate of 50 guns, called the Ilia-Murometz; one such vessel the Arcbangel building yards [supply every year to the Imperial marine. The Persian Governraent is understood to have prohibited the export of silver, from fear that otherwise that precious metal would entirely quit the country; for come time past the value of shares has been very variable there. Whatever changes maybe going on in the Russian Empire, it appears as if the old traditional imperturbable discipline of the army is notyet extinct there. General orders published by the Minister of War a few days back give an instance. In the early part of the month of June a conflagration broke out at the hamlet of Bardosk, and consumed 192 houses, among which was a house occupied by th Invalids Company in garrison there. Before thit house a sentry was posted, whom, in the hurry and confusion incidental to the fire, nobody though; of relieving. The private who was here on guard, of the name of Pankov, remamne at his post though the house was burned down and then his sentry-box ; and it was not til after his own cloak had caught fire that help cam3 in the shape of a non-commissioned officer, who re lieved him. Tne Emperorhas promot-d the privats to be a non-commissioned officer, presented him with 50 roubles, and had his name and his firmnesi immortalized in the above-mentioned Ganeral Orders. The Northern .Be, being compelled to concentrat3 its energies exclusively on foreign affairs, has been expatiating of late on the BiUl now before the British Legislature for admitting Jews to a seat in Parliament; and comically enough the language it uses betrays very plainly that the idea the Nm-Uwrtl, Bee entertains of the Jews in England likely t, canvas for admission to Parliament is taken from the Russian and Polirh Jews, familiar to its editorial eyes, unconscious of the enormous difference tha% exists between the Jews of difterent nations. The amount of comparative freedom permitted to the Russian press in discussing foreign politics stands them in very little stead now that there are none to discuss; whatever the inclinatiors of ths Goverment may bei it is evident that the people a' large are unwilling to have their local affairs brought to the knowledge of the press. The editors of the different papers loudly complain of the imnossi. bility of their getting any information of homs events, and an embryo correspondent in one of the distant Governments narrates the results oE his first communication. He had written some details about a storm, or an inundation, or a meteor to a St. Petersburg paper, from a town that hat hitherto never seen its name in the columns o' a journal; the number containing the communi cation arrives in the town from the capital, each inhabitant looks aghast at the other, and, only after summoning much resolution, do the bolder spirits venture on asking their acquaintance, if they have read the so-and-so ? Which question is invariably answered in the negative. The Natschaluik, or highest official of the place, takes the earliest opportunity of informing the inhabitants officially that there is a man among them who writes to the papers, and the most rigid inquisition is set on foot through the whole fabric of society to ascertain who this sacrilegious violator of their privacy is; the slightest punishment that awaits him on detection is his being sent to a Russian Coventry.
HEIlRow SCHOOL.-In our notice of the apeeches yesterday we accidentally omitted to Make alluEsioxa to the new chapel now in course of erection for the pupls of Harrow School. It is already far advanced, and will, it is hoped, be completed in the course of the next quarter. The chapel is designed by Mr. G. G. Scott, A.R.A. It is an elegant edifice in the early ornamented style of architecture, with a nave and aside aisles; it is to be surmounted by a short tower of open work, with a periphery of cracifi.ntal pinnacles, from the mnidst of which springs a graceful spire, which, wilm serve as a landimark for miles distant. The sum of 1,O000. is. required for the completion of the chapel, and an earnest appeal is made to the friends of the school and to old Harrovians in behalf of the undertakng. The subject will probably be "ventilated" at the annual dinner on Wednesday next Advertisement.]-Charlotte Bront.'s Posthumous Novel, 1he P1rofesser."1 in 2 vol&., by Correr Sell (Obanlotte Bronte), author of "1Jano Lyre' ,1 "Bhlrley.," Villette " &o., mazy nowbe had az all the librariess.

The conspiracy of a certain number of Italians against the life of the Emperor, to whicb I alluded some days ago, seems to be marked by a more serious charaoter than was originally supposed. The persons taken into custody are also more numerous; successive arrests, either in consequence of disclosures made by accomplices or obtained from papers found at their lodgings, have increased the number from three to 21; I doubt whether it will rest here. Their examination by the Juges d'Instruction is still going on, and it is said that abundant proofs exist of their culpability. Few authentic particulars have transpired as to their plans or the mode by which those plans were to be carried out. The maun object, however, was to get rid of the Emiperor; the overthrow of the Imperial 2rgime would follow as a matter of course, as well as the re-establishment of the RedRepublic. Every Italian who attempts to poniard a Sovereign is classed by public opinion as a disciple of Mazzini, whose opinions on political crimes of this kind are known. It Is not surprising, theou, that the present prisoners should be considered as of the same schooL Whether . Mazzini will recognize them as his own I cannot say; I have, however, heard that their opinions are much more advanced even than bis, and that they look upon him as little better than aReactionist. They belong to the same school as Pianori and their object is the same. They are also said to be connected with the conspirators arrested in Genoa who proposed to proclaim the Republic in that city. This, I think it right to add, is the account given by official people, who appear to have no doubt, from the documentary and other evidence in their poseasfon, of bringing the matter home to them. They will be tried by the Court of Asaizes of the Seine. A few who, except on the clearest and most undeniable proof, are generally incredulous in these matters, dwell on the coincidence of t.his new plot against the Emperor and the elections, as if got up by the police with a view to excite the fears of the bourgeoisie. This I hardly believe; such a game is too dangerous to play. We have a telegraphic despatch from Turin of the 2d, which announces as follows "TURIN, Ju.y 2. ' An Insurectionay attermpt at Laghorn has been put down. The steamer (sgliari, whicd left Genoa for Tunis, and fell into the hands of the insurgents, attacked the island of Ponza, belonging to the Neapolitan Government, ard seb at hiberty the prisoners who were detained there. The insnrgents and the released prisoners then landed in arms at Sapri, in the lower principaity. The Cagliari was afterwards captured by two Neaplitan frigates, and troops sent It pursuit of the insurgents." Letters from Florence of the 28th give further particulars respecting the precautions adopted by the police at Pisa during the fete of the Luminaria. No spirituous liquors were allowed to be served in the publichouses uintil after 1 o'clock in the morning. Patrols traversedthestreets, andwhenmore thanthreepersonswereseentogetherthey were atonco dispersed. Several private dwellings were converted into guardhouses, to the no smnall surprise of the proprietors, for when these returned from the theatre they found sentries at their doors, who at Srst refused to allow them to sleep in their beds. The following day, while the religious procession was passing the great square at Leghorn, a chair fell, which caused some alarm, and the troops on duty prepared to charge. The inhabitants of the neIghbouring villages were commanded by the police not to go to Pisa, and several young men were arrested at Pistoja who refused to obey. The letter from which these particulars are derived concludes by announcing that the Tuscan Government had appointed to the vacant sees four Bishops, who have been approved by the Pope. They are-M. Imberti, Vicar-Generaland Rector of the College of Prato, to theArchbishopric of Florence; M. Targioni de Prato, to the Bishoprlc of Volterra; M. Antonelli de Figline to the Bishopric of Fiesole; and Al. Paoletti de Volterra to that of Montepulciano. A letter from Toulouse, of the 1st instant, says that the weather continues most favourable for the crops. The great heat during last week has considerably advanced the maturity of the wheat. The heads are yellow, and promise-an abundant produce. The harvest will commence this week in the neighbourhood of Toulouse. For rye, barley, and early oats a s4perabundant produce is expected. The vines are loaded with grapes. The oidiumn is vanquished. The sterms lave produced a partial effect, sec'h as occurs every year. Travellers arriving at Toulouse from all parts of France are unanimous in declaring that the crops this year are, in point of quaZity, unexceptional. The U7itiives contains the following article on the mutiny among the native troops in India -- " In our opinion, it is wrong to attribute the discontent of the troops to attempts of religious propagaudism, for the Indians are not so susceptible on this point as is believed. The cause is rather to be scrilbed to the general conduct o' the English towards the natives. The English, in conseo quence of the haughtines and disdainful stiffness which chara^teri7e thom,ave never snoceeded in obtaining the sym paNy-ofeP os-d-wxth me= into contact Hatred maybe forgotten and actF of crnelty forgiven, but contempt and diedain always remain an effective barrier. Look at the Irish: they cross the ocean, and seek a new home in America, where, however, they meet with the descendants of their oppressors, who have denied their an. -_estors and detest them profoundly. 2Nevertheless, the Yankees have presTrved that offensive contempt for tha vanquished race, and In the New World hatred and antpathy exist more than ever. The Poles are less separates from the Russians than are the Irish from the English. But it is far worse with the Hindoos. India has nevor been otherwise for England than a ich and fertile country, that offered abundant spoils. The Company has, it is trne, reducod in certain places the taxes imposed by native Princes, and has regulated their colection, but on he whole tho former taxation has been maintained, so that the poor Hindoos have gained nothing by their revolts, rni nowpay to foreigners what they paid to native rulers. England, with persevering skill, has employed every means to consolidate her power. She has allowed few Englishmen to aettle in the country, being aware of the haughtiness of thei l character; moreover, the American rebellion has taught her to mistrast her own children. The officials of the Company are forbidden to come into direct contact with the mass o. the population, and they select docile and respected agents finally, they are ordered to repeet with the greatest car; the customs and prejudices of the natives. The Company, In order to complete its work, has organized a numerous army of natives, who are, however, mainly commanded by European officers and non-commissioned officers. This army is well disciplined, but has not received too developed an instraction, and does sot possess improved weapons ; bat it has sufficed, supported as it is by admirable European troops, to maintain peaee in the country and to keep in order the inactive population. A few years ago, if wa remember right, a Sepoy regiment refused to eat cowbeef, and, leaving its lines, sat dowa in the open field In one hrgo circle; the neon remained in that position, and without eating, for three days, and they were determined on starving themselves in the event of Government declining to aocede so their claims. We are enabled by present events to judp of the immense change effected among the Sepoy3 within a few years. The resignation and submission which once istinguished them -appear to have vanished. Hitherto Great Britain has, in India as in Europe, parriled the dangers which result from the vast nature of her enterprisss by increasing the latter; bht these enterprises are out of all proportion to the military resourcos of the country, and menace her with a fearful reaction and with a terrible declinA-" The Univers coneludes by stating that the movement of troops and the interruption of commerce will tend to increaze the national debt, under the weight of whieh it- believes England is, sooner or later, destined to suoeumb.

The Globe of last night publishes the following telegraphic despatch in addition to the news given in our second edition yesterday:_ " PARIS, JuLy 3. "We have advices of further insurrections ix Italy organized, it is said, by Mazzini. Two hundred arrests hav been made in Genoa. Thousands of smuskets have been seized, and large quantities of aammunition, " We have nothing from Naples." The Globe adds the following observations, in which we entirely concur:- " The telegraphic statements respc:ting insurrectionary movements in Italy must be received with that caution which the aberrations of the telegraph on other occasions have rendered necessary. The statement first came in quite an unin. telligible shape, and attracted little attention. It was brie3y announced that a conspiracy had been discovered at Genoa, and that 40 persons had been arrested. Last night it took a more precise form. The story, as it now stands, is, that insurrection had taken place alike in Leghorn and Naples; that in both places it had been suppressed by the autborities, but that at Leghorn a portion of the insurgent, seized the steamer Cagliari, then in the harbour, en route from Genoa to Tunis, and succeeded in putting to sea. Shaping their course for the Neapoliten coast they passed the Isle of Elba, and, landing on the island of Ponza, one of the Neapolitan islands lying south of Gaeta, attacked the prison there and released the prlsoners. Embarking once more with their numbers augmentod by the gaol delivery they had so irregularly effected, thoy shaped their courso for the province of Saerno, landing, it is said, at SaprL Here, we are told, they were en. countered by the Gendarmerie of tho province, and put to the rout. Several, it is stated, were captured, and the re. mainder fled, most probably to the uninviting and rugged mountains of Calabria, always a stronghold of disaffection. Such is the meagre outline of tho story as conveyed to us by the electric telegraph."

MONEY-MABKE:and OITYINTAJJIGENCE. Fnday Evening. The growing ease in the discount-market, couplect with the better accounts from the Paria Bourse, caused the funds to open this morning with firmness, and subsequently to experience an advance of an eighth. The first transactions in Coneols were 920 to i, and after several purchases they went to 92 to ; at which they steadily closed. In the Stock-E:xchange thereo was no particular pressure for money, and, notwithstanding the preparations for to-morrow, the 4th of the month, the demand in the discount-matket and at the Bank was comparatively moderate. Bank Stock left off at 212i to 214; Reduced, 921; New Three per Centg., 92 to j; Exchequer Bonds, 981 to i; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discousit to par. India Bonds are very heavy, at 12s. to 6s. discount, and but for the prospect of lower rates in the moneymarket durng the remainder of the year some holders would probably be induced to give the requisite 12 montbs? notice of an intention to sead them in for payment. The transactions in foreign securities were rather I numerous and in some cases at a slight advance. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 100I; Chbian Six per Cents. 102i; ditto Three per Cents., 77 ; Mexican, for the account, 22k; Peruvan Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 80; ditto Three per Cents., 55k; Portuguese, 45; Russian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 96 to i; Sardinian, 90; Spanish Deferred, 253 t; ditto Passive, 5I t; ditto Certificates, 6k i; Turkish Six per Cents., 96l i -; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, l0 for money and lO2u for the account; and Thtch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97i and 98 In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the ratesa were a shade lower than laat post. The corn-market this morning was without alteration. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business at former prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 40c. for money and 67f. 60c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing renewed flatness, but no material alteration. A furtbher sum of about 15,OCOL. Anerican gold. was sold to the Bank to-day. Some small parcels of gold are expected immaediately fromRussia. The rate of exchange isvery favourable for its tranmission, but the difficulties interposed by the Government amount almost to a prohibition. The Paris letters mention further withdrawals of gold from the Bank of France to be sent to Italy. The rate of discount at Hiamburgr has slightly dEclined, but it is stiU 7i per cent. There was an expectation, however, that it will go lower. It seems possible that the revolt in India may have some temporary effect on our indigo supplies A private letter from Agra of the 22dof May, after stating that the forts were being armed and prvisioned, and that there was a prospect of the British residents being shut up and besieged, if the outbreak should become general, adds, "the idigo factories in this district, and, indeed, throughout the Doab, are at a standstilL Contracts and business of every kind are suspended, and Europeans Are iiocking i from al quarters for refuge." It is understood that the Bank Charter Committee are not likely to conclude their labours during the present session. They will doubtless report evidence and be reappointed at tbe next assembhnc? of Parliament. Consequently their final report wiA1 probably not appear until the end of 1858, or be,ginning of 1859. Much surprise has been created in the city to-day by a remark reported to have been made by Lord St. Leonard's last night, in the discussion on the Great Northern Railway Bill, to the effect that " the company were not bound by the fraud and forgeries of Redpath, and the only question was one of policy with regard to operations on the Stock-Jixchange." The simple facts of the case are that Redpath as the authorized registrar of the company imsued fictitious certificates of stock to innocent purchasers, and that the company were considered to be responsible not only ia a direct manner for the acts of their servant, but indirecely for the culpable neglect by which those acts were rendered possible. So complete has been the conviction on this point that there has hitherto been no attempt to dispute it in any case. The Royal Swedish Railway Company at once recog- - .1 i.. y*.uzxurreq zo nave oeen created bY their chairman, Sadleir; and the Crystal Palace Company adopted a similar course in the case of Robson. It is true that in America the conduct of a public company under circumstances of this kind bas been different, and that the New York and Nevw Haven Railway have set the sufferers by the fraufds of their chairman, Schuyler, at defiance. Not only, however, has the step been atigmatized as a painful blot by all the respectable merchants in that city, but the victims, confident in the equity oE their claim, have appealed to the law, which is the same as that in England, for its enforcement. The precise amount of the specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo is 859,2201., of which 507,7661. is silver for India, and 348,1001. for China. The only gold is 3,3W4. The produce-markets during the wTeek, although steady, have been rather less buoyant than at thek last report. Sugar continues unsettled, an the trade appea.r indisposed to extend their purchases, while accounts from Riavannah and Anmerica are less favourable to holders. The few sales effected exhibit, therefore, a further decline of 6d. to Is. importers, however, have not maanitested a strong desire to realize, and fine qualties close without material change. There is no new feature in the coffee-market. Cocoa it firmly maintained. Speculators have taken a large quantity of rice, chiefly white Bengal, at 6d. to 9d. recovery fiom last week, but common descriptions have not been influenced. The spice-market presents a steady appearance, both black and white pepper closing higher. Other kinds are without any particuLar change. In saltpetre there has been a rise of 6d. to Is., without much activity in the demand. The tea-market continues to exhibit much firmness. About 15,000 packages passed auction on Wednesday, but a small portion only was realized, as holders required high rates. Fine and medium Congous are sought at a considerable advance. Common closes at Is. 2id. to Is. 2!d. per lb. A meeting was held to-day of the creditors of Messrs. Evans, Hoare, and Co., exporters in the Australian trade, who failed on the 10th of June. The debts were stated at 82,3931., with only 36,0641. to meet them, even supposing the consignments to Australia, consisting of beer, wines, &c., to realize their invoice prices, and a Large amount of indirect liabilities to run off without leading to any claim. The creditors, indignant at this result, and at the general conduct of the business, resolved, with only two dissentients, to carry the case into bankruptcy. MIr. Hoare, it was stated, had been induced to join the firm and to bring 11,0001. into it, in total ignorance of its real position. Annexed is the statement submitted:- EVANS, H0& AIMD 00.

TWITS OF BRROR. HOUSE OF LORDS. JIJLY 3. - - COOI'rR V. SLADE. untlr 1.rusrmpe sat this morning for the purpose of hear. ing the argaments iu this writ of error from the decision of the Court of Exchequer Chamber. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Brougham, Lord Wensleydale, and other peers, together with tne learned judges, were present. Sir F. Kelly, Mr. O'Malley, and Mr. Lush were counsel on behalf of the plaintiff in error, and the Attorney-G eneral, with Mr. Kingdon and Mr. Crouch, represented the defendant. It appeared from the arguments that the present proceedings had arisen out of an action brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendant in error, to recover penalties alleged to have been incurred by the latter under the Corrapt Practices Prevention Act, 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 102, sec. 2 at an election of members of Parliament for the borough ol Cambridge, in August, 1854. There were a great many counts in the declaration, but the only material ones were the 7th and 8th. The 7th count stated that the defendant, after thepassing of the said Act, and before the commencement of the suit, promised money to one 1. Carter, who was a voter within the meaning of the said statute for and at the said election, in order to induco the aid P. Carter to vote at the said election, contrary to the form of the said statute, whereby the defendant became liable to forfeit and forfeited for his said offence the -umn of 1001. The 8th count alleged that the defendant, contrary to the said statute, had corruptly given money to the said Richard Carter for his vote, whereby he forfeited a further snm of 100g. The defendant pleaded the geiteral issue by statute 21 James 1., chap. 4, seo. 4. The cause came on for trial at Cambridge on the 20th of July, 1855, before Lord Wensleydale, then Baron Parke. when it was proved that at the election of members of Parliament for the borough of Cambridge in August, 1854, the defendant, Mr. Slade, Q C., anl Lord Maidstone were two of the candidates who presented themselves forelection. A person named Richard Carter was one of the voters for Cambridge, but on the occasion of the election he was at Huntingdon. The committeeforconducting the election of Lord Maidstone and the defendant being desirous of securlng his vote, sent him the following setter "Mr. E. Carter. "Cambridge Borough E3ectinn.

He was subsequentlypaid the sum of 8s. for his railway expenses, and it was upon the promise contained in that letter to pay the travelling expenses, and the subsequent payment of those expenses, that the action was grounded. No evidence was adduced on behalf of the defendant, but his counsel contended that there was no evidence for the jury upon the counts in question. The learnedJudge ruled that there was evidencoe to go to the jury, and directedthat it they thought that the defendant or any personon his behalf had promised to payCarteranymoneyto nduce him to vote, and if they were of opinion that such money had been paid for such a purpose, they must find their verdict for the plaintiff, although such sum, so promised and paid, was no more than the fair and reasonable expenses incurred by Carter in travelling from Huntingdon to Cambridge. The defendant's counsel excepted to that ruling, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff upon both count&. When the bill of exceptions came on to be argued before tho Court of Exchequer Chamber it was contended, on behalf of the defendant, that the direction of the learned judgo was wrong on both counts. On the seventh oonnt it was submitted that there was no evidence to go to the jury that the defendant or any person on his behalf promised money to Carter to induce bim to vote. With regard to the eighth count the direction was erroneous, inasmuch as the learned judge did not leave it to the jury to saywhetheror no' the moneyhad been paid corruptly, but had told them that if they considered the money had been paidtheynustltnd for the plaintiff. He oughttohavedirected them that the payment of the travelUing expenses was perfectly legal, and that the statute authorized the payment of legal expenses bonijideincurred at an election. It was fur. ther contended that there was no evidence to show that the defendant had authorized the payment of the money. The Court of Exchequer Chamber decided that there was no evidence for the jury upon either count, and direoted a venire de nowo. The present writ of error was then brought. Sir F. KELLY, on behalf of the plaintiff in error, now contended that there was evidence to go to the jury with regard totheceventhcount, inasmuchasthepromisecontained in the letter was a conditional promise to pay the voter's expenses, provided he voted in favour of particular persons. There would have been no harm in simply promiSiDg to pay his expenses without naming the patties for whom he was to vote, but, that having so named the parties, the promise became illegal withm the meaning of the statute, and therefore the defendant was liable to the penalties now sought to be recovered. With regard to the eighth count, of course if the promise to pay was illegal, the piyment of the money under that romise was Megal also. A fresh point was raised before their Lordships as to whetber there was any evidence to show that Mfr. Slade had authorized his committee to promise. It was admitted that he was in the room at the time the letter was written, and that, instead of objecting, he had said, in answer to a question that he considered travelling expenses to be perfectly legal. Under these circumstances, the judgment of the Court below ought to be ravereod .- - The ATroxNeyn.GZNMt.&T., on behalf of the defendant in error, argaed that if the case was decided against Mr. Slade, he would, under the statute, be liable also to fine and imprisonment. He merely urged that upon their Lordships to show how absurd it was to say that there was anything criminal in paying tho bon4fide travelling expenses of an elector. The Act had been passed to prevent corruption and could it be said that to trouble a person to come all the way from Huntingdon to Cambridge to vote, and then to be kept danclng about half a day, for the large sum of 8s. was bnbery and corruption? A great many of the committees in the House of Commons allowed travelling expenses to electors, and under all the circumstances he should contend that the defendant was authorized both to promise to pay and to pay an elector's travelling expenses. Lord BsROUGsr asked whether it would be legal for a pOrson to promise to pay a bilU to a creditor in order to inuuce him to vote fora partioular person. The ATIoRIzy-GEzxRAL said he did not wiqh to contend that it was. But the present case was entirely different, for in the one case there might be a profit upon the goods for which the bill was sent in, but in the present case there was no profit or benefit to the elector; he was zmerely repaid money which he had actually expended out of his pocket. He should also contend that the promise topay the railway expenSes was unconditional, as it was in a line by itself, and was an express promise to pay if the elector came to Cambridge. The third point was that there was no proof that the defendant had autholszed the letter to be sent or the money to be paid. The mere fact of his having said that he thought the payment of travelling eapenses was legal was not sufficient to show that he had authorized his committee to send the letter. Under the circumstances he should contend that the judgment of the Court below was correct and must be affirmed. Sir F. KErLy replied, and said that no man in his senses would fall to understand from the letter of the 12th of August, 1854, that Carter was to be paid his expenses upon condition that he voted for the defendant. At the conclusion of the arguments, The LonD CHAxCELLOR put the following questions to the learned judges :-First, whether in the letter of the 12th of August, 1854, there was any evidence to go to the jury that the defendant was guilty of bribery within the ineaning of the Act; secondly, whether there was any evidence that the letter in question was written by the defendant's authority; and, thirdly, whether there was any evidence thab the defendant had corruptly paid money to Carter in consequence of his having voted in his favour. The learned JnUDGES took time to consider their opinions. The further consideration was then adjourned until Monday morning. TE}L HCOUSE OF LORDS. The lord Chancellor has frequently complained of the noises which usually accompany a morning sitting. The slightest sound echoes through the building, and entirely prevents the already fatigued ear from distinguishing a single word. As it is not easy to discover from which part of the building the hammering proceeds a great deal of time is lost, their Lordships having sometimes to wait ten minutes before they canuprocure silence. This morning about a dozen or two of hammers commenced knocking, and to say that the noise produced was like the loudest thunder would be uo exaggeration. Of course not a word the Attorney-General said could be heard. Lord BRoUnsAN ordered the knocking to be stopped, and saidhe heartily wished the construction of the Houses was completed. The ATTroRNE-GEu=nze said if the hammering was to go on untll the building was completed, he was afraid it would last a long time.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHA1CERY, LIncorI's-mX. TJYv R- RX PART4EDOHERTY, IN RE DOHERTY. (Bfore the LORDS JU8TICEs OF APPEAL.\ P0 -11 Os sI'lle uecislon of Air. Commls. sioner crry, of tho Liverpool District Court of Bankrnptoy, whereby he had adjudicated Mr. John Doherty, late of Harrington-street, Liverpool, corn and provision merchant, a bankrupt. Prom tho petition and affidavits it appeared that Mr. James Lister, the manager of the Liverpool Union Bank, presented a petition on the 9th of June now last, on hebalf of the bank, praying for the adjudication, which was rade ontho following day. Mr. Doherty disputed the act of bankrnsptcy, but on the 22d of June the samoe was confrmed. The alleged act of bankruptcy was that Mr. Doherty sailed on the 23d of Mlay last for New york, with intent to delay his creditors; but Mr. Doherty denied this intent, and swore that he wentat the urgent request of some of his creditors (Messrs. Moss and Grainger, who were large creditors, and by the consent of Mr. Smith, manager of the Borough Bank) to arrange his affairs with his brother James, residing at that place, who was his debtor in 60,O0N01, which sum, if received, would suffice to pay all his debts in full. Before his departure he sent notices to his creditors of his intention anid of his motive for going, and he execumted aL power of attorney to Mr. Owen Corr, his clerk, to act for him in all businessaffairs and transactions. Mr. Doherty also swore thatt if he bad believed or supposed that his depairture would be used as groand for bankruptcy he would not on any account have gone. He by his petition therefore prayed a reversal or vaziation of the commissioner's order, the petition being preented by Mr. Corr, as his attorney acting uader the power before stated. It also appeared that Mr. Doherty dishonoured a bill held by the Union Bank, which became due on the 20th of May, on which day he suended payments, and on the day he sailed from England a large amount of bills fell due, and on the day before he executed an assignment of the greater art of his estate and effects, inclusive of the debt due from his brother James, and a covenant that he (Mr. Doherty) woald not receive any of the property, debts, or effects assigned. The commnissioner, in his judgment, observed that upon the whole ease, considering that a person must be supposed to foresee and intend whatever is the necessay consequence of his own acts, the departure from this country after suspension of payments without any provision made for the payment of bills to fall due in the absence of Mr. Doherty, and after an assignment of the debt due from his brother, with the covenantnot to receive, must be considered an act of bankruptcy. Mr.BAcoxand Mr. WELLiNGTONCOOPER, who appeared .n pport of the petition, stated that some of the bills which fell due after the departure of Mr. Doherty had been paid, though it must be admnitted that others had been dishonoured, those paid being bills guaranteed by the Borough Bank., Mr. Cairns and Mr. Aspinall (of the common law bar) ap peared for the petitioning creditor. Before the petition had proceeded far in argument, The LoRDsJJusicErs, mnterposing to remark upon the generalassignment, directed that the question of bankinnptoy or no bankruptcy mustbetriedin action at law tobe tuied at the next Liverpool assies, in which the alleged bankrupt must admit the trading and the petitioning crseditors' deht. The case is to be mentioned again on Tuesday morning. EX PARTE BUNNY, IN RE BulNiiY. Mr. DORm said that this was the petition of the bankrupt, seeking to annul an adjudication pronounced against him by Mr. Commissioner Pane. As a preliminary objection, the learned counsel stakcd that the petition for adudication was not in the form prescribed by the article x in the schedule to the Bankrupt Law Coneolidation Act. The bankrupt carried on business at Newbury, in Berkshire, and on the 9th of November, 1853, he went with his family to settle in New Zealand, baing largely indebted at the time. On the 12th of March, 1855, the petition for adindication was filed, and alleged that for three years before November, 1853, he carried on business at Newbury, whereas the statute required that the form should be that the business was carried on for six months immediately prior to the date of the petition. Their LonDsmps declined to annul the adjudication en such a ground, unless nnder the sanction of a decision of a ourt of law, but intimated that if MIr. Doria thought fit to try the question at law this Court wvould give every facltity. The petiton was ordered to stand over to enable the bankrupt to answer the affidavit Sled by the assignees. M>r. Swanston appeared to oppose the petition. EX PARTE STEPHA'xOFF, IN RE STEPHANOPF. This was apetition of the bankrupt, praying the alteration of a decision of Mr. Commissioner Stevenson, of the Liver. pool District Court, by which he had suspended the certificate for 12 calendar months without protection, and then to be of the second class. Mr. CmNs and Mr. BARDSWELL supported the appeal, stating that the bankrupt applied to the bank of LeyLand and Co. for assistance tocury on his business as commission agent, which they agreed o do upon the terms that the bankrupt should not speculate on his own account, but confine himself to the commision business, should not give long credit i should pay advances at short dates of a week or a fortnigat, or inbillsof his ovuor of good foreign houses. Advances were made, but on the 8th of February, 1856, the bankers stopped their supply,on the ground, as they alleged, that short payments were not made, and that the balance had grown too large. This reason the bankrupt denied to be true, and alleged that the bankers had refused the good bils he tendered-and furtber, tb.t by reason .41. stoppage of the supplies he lobt large sums for commission. ThA hanlers required that the bankrupt's books should be subaitted to a Mr. Banner, an accountant, who upon inquiry reported that the baukrupt had entered Into specuLations contrary to the agreement, on one of which he had lost 3,500. on tallow. The bankrupt allegeE that he considered himself to be at liberty to specnlate, as he thought the agrcement was at an end by reason of the bank departing from their engagement. It was true that in the books the transaction of the tallow was represented as a commission matter, and not as it really exsted-namely, a joint adventure of the bankrupt and another firm. The commioner felt himself bound to pronounce the decision he did, as the case came within the penal clauses of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act. Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE.-The comminsioner seems to have considered that the entries in the books regarding the tallow transaction were wrong,' nadmade for the purpose of concealment and fraud. True the bankrapt has stated his contrition, and so far it Is creditable to him h but the fact is one of those which this Court has always thought it proper to visit with severity, like every other deviation from truLth. Mr. Bacon and Mlr. Bagley, who appeared to oppose the petition, were not cealled upon. Their LoaDsmps did not say whether the offeneo of the bankrupt came within the 256th section of the Bankrupt LawvConsolidation Act, but upon the facts as proved it appeared that the bankrupt had been guilty of doing that whih his leading counsel had palliated in the best manner he could, and most certainly mostly for the benefit of his client. Stll the course pused ended in untruth. It was possible that if the learned commissioner had passed a less severe sentence this Court might not have thought it necessary to alter it. As the sentence stood, this CourS did not dare, whether on the ground of public justice or of the rights of the bank, a v.ry eonsiderablo creditor, to give any mitigation of the sentence pronounced. The claims of public as well as of private justieo required that there should be nomitigationof thesentence pronounced by the commissioner, and the petion must be dismissed, with so niuch of costs as could be covered by the deposit.
VICE-CHANCELLOR'S COURT. JuLY 3. _ MTII V. EAST K1NT AILMWAY COMPANV. wieJorc vwe-Uhauccuor Sir W. P. WOOD.) -ts &ONOUR gave judgment in this case, which was argued on Thursday, and reported in T'Ie uinzes of yesterday, and said that the question turned mainly unon the constraction of the 38th clause in the East Kent asilway Act, which was as follows :-" In the construction of the said railway through or over the property of Edward Smith (the plaintiff), situate at or near Sittingbourne, the same aball not be constructed so as to approach nearer to the mill and premises of the said Edward Smith than tho centre line shown on the said deposited plans, withont the consent in writing of the said Edward Smith, his executors, administrators, andassigns, first had andobtained." With respect to the case raised by the defendants of acquiescence by the plaintiff arising from his knowledge of the intention of the company, he could not hold that there had been any such conduct by the plaintiff as to lead the Court to say that the protection given by clause 38 of the Act had been waived, or that there was anything from which the plaintiffrmost necessarily have inferred that the company were about to violate that clause. There was nothing, therefore, to deprive the plaintiff of his right, whatever it amounted to, under the 38th clause. HlisHonour, after adverting to the various constractions put in the argument upon clause 38 as to the meaning of the words "railway" and " centre line," said that he could not preclude the defendants from having the question tried, and directed the motion to stand over, the plaintiff to beat liberty to bring such action as he might be advised, with liberty for either side to apply.
COURT OF QUENS BENCH, GUIL IALL, JULY 3. PRPICLS PATENT CANDLE COMPANY V. BAUW 'S'S PATENT VCA'1MY.V. VAN-1v 7, - AVW1 rrtuT VCJOrC LOrd UAIP3BFLL and aSpecial rurUj.) Sir P. Thesiger, Mr. Grove, Q.C., Mr. IL Smith, QC., Mr. L'sh, QEC., and Mr. Webster appeared for the plain. tiffs; Mfr. H Hl,Q.C., and Mr. Hindmarsh for the defendlants. The plaintiffs in this action were Price!s Patent Candle Company, who have large manufactories in London and Liverpool; and the defendants were Bauwen's Patent Candle Company, whose manufactory is in the Ranelah-. road, Pimlico. he action was brought to recover damages for the infringement of two patents, of which the plaintiffs are the proprietors, the former of which had been pranted in 1842 to Messrs. Jones and Wilson, and the latter, n 1843, to Messrs. Gwynne and Wilson, for improvements in the treatmaent of oily and fatty matters and the manufacture of candles. The defendants denied the infringement, and. alo, in fact, the novelty of the inventions. It appeared from the plaintiffs' evidence that the first of the above patents, "tJones and Wilson's," was granted on thle 8th of December, 1842, and among other improvements it introduced a new mode of admitting steam into the sti for the parpose of distilling the oiy and fatty matters used in the manufacture. The specification stated that steam had already been admitted in the process of distilling atty and oily bodies, but only in such a manner as to admit the free steam at one aperture, and it suggested that the atentees had found it advantageous that the steam should introduced " in minutely divided streams throughout the whole of the fatty or oily bodies under process, such streams being admitted below tho surface of the fatty or oily bodies, and at or near the bottom of the still." The specification then added:-" We introduce suoh strean by perforated steam pipes in the form of a eoil or otherwise, lin likoe manner tow~at has heretofore been practised when boiling fatty and oily matters; bu~t such mode of introducing steam in minutely' divided streams bas not been practised in combination with distilla. tior," Thea mothed oS ioducing the stm orginAlly adoptod btthe plintiswi;t5 by zeans of scpipe deen4ing throug theoily watter and 1orminga eoif ae thebotto4 of the stiLl The coil being perforated on the sides allowed the bteam to esapo into the oily matter, and thus facili. tated the proces of distillation; but, insteadofthismethod thetfintiftlnowruseda descendinofpipe,which communicated wi six tubes lying sear theobottom of the ill, from the perforated sides of which the slum ecaped into the oily matter. It was alleged thatthe defendants had infringed this patent by the mode In which they introduced steam "in minutely divided streams" below the surface of the fatty or oily bodie E. The defendants Introduoed the steam by means of a pipe ternmating near the botom of the still, with a dil coneavo cn the under de * and the plain. tiffe witnees stated tiat the steam descending through the tube would bo spreLd over the under surfxoe of the disk, and would ascend through the fatty or oily matter in the Mill intheform of a thnfim, er in thewords of the plaintiffs patent, "in minutely divided trems." It was therefore contended by theplalntiffs that the disk usdby the defendants was merely a " mechanical uivalent" for the means adopt by thelalintiffs, and prouesed precisely the same results The plaintiff' second patent, "Gwynne and Wilsons" was dated the 28th of December, 1843 and among other improvoments it described " a mode of dil. BD8g fAt and oily matters by causing such distillation to be effocted by the beat of a sultablo gaseous body (preferring steam)." By the speci6cation enrolled under a previous patent of the 16th of ~November, 1843, the patentees had de. scribed certain apparatus and proceses-soed by them for the admistion.of steam or other suitable gaseous bodies into fatty and oily matters s a means of excluding the air during the distillation ibereof; butin the said apparatus and processes it was proposed to effect the distillation by the beat of a fire placed under the stlhl which it *as desirable to avoid, on account of theriakof the heated fatty or oily matter escaping into the fre. It wa, discovered that, by using as the ditlling agent a suitable gaseous body (preferring steam), hatede to a degree sufficient to cause the distilltion of fatty and oily mattera, the patentees were able toplaSO the stil at a'distanc frorx the fire, and thereby to avoid dangerin case of any escape of the matters under roceass This was to be effected by the heat of steam, to co admittedli the aunner toial cutinctfe specification of the patent of the 16th of 'November. I 843, the ppe ad steam worm being incresed in size, the heatlin of het team being effectecl by causn it to Pas through *ti apparatus sinilar to thas in usue 'heating air for the purpote of producng a hot blast in the manufactureof iron. The specificationz thent referred to Newton's patent of 1841, which described an apparatus for heating steam usd in the distillation of fatty and oily miatters, by eausn the same to p,si through pipes -bjectedo extenally to te at of the fatty or oily matters themlves, heated by a naked fire to the cegreerequired to produce the distillation theof and they dislaimen d the use of heated steam in the proce- uof ditilng faty or oily t nattes, whre the Madition beat of the steam fs aerHved from the fatty or oily ziatten themselves heited by fire as abovementioned, or where the fatty or oiy matte into whichheated steam lsadmittedsrebeatd by a nakeadfirnup to a temnperature as high as that of the iy. toming steam. The substantial distinction between the plaintiffs and Newton's process as above dtscrlbed by the patente aPpeared to he this :-In Newtons proess the steam was intrdacecl in what was called "a ssbheated state,"-i. c., at a lower tempertturo than that of the oily matter; whereas, in the plaintiffs' procs he steam was introduced in what was caled "a superhbested te C., heated to a much grter degree thant the oily matter. In fact, in the pWaitiffs process the heated steoam was the only agency by wt chiseat Was appled to the oily maper, the ftre under the stl being altogether dispensedl with. The plaintiffs complained that the dfendants 'hd adopted a process of distilation whieh was substantially the same as tht tpatentedinl 843 -vizd,by tsu pheatedstam"andin order to establish the case the ei wo witnesses named Hastings audMupy. who hid been formerly in the defendants employ, anTilwho yve a de3cription of the procest which they ado o cording to their evidence thede. fendants had a rnaeo at a distance from the still, but communicating with itby aflue ; and also acoil of steam pipes above the fumnae from which the steam entered the still. They stated that they hiad instractions to keep the coil of pipess, at a red heat, t effect of which wouilde that the ste ould become " superheateds " but that by the ums of a damper in the flue the heat of the steam could be kept dlown so that the mianufactun might be eonoucted with "Wsubheated steam." It appeared th,at two inspectors, hessrs. May and Perkis, had been appointed by the Court of Chancery to inspect the defendantifs' appatus and its results. The inspecto repoorrh which wts resa in rkCot, showed that the results of the( experiments, which were conducted entirely by the defendants' own workmen, were more succesafd when " subheated steam" as neued than when, by drawing out the damper, the "1supRmheated steam" was employed. But -two eDymists of distinction amr. Warren De a Rue audlr. Hoffminau,-wore5 dmied to show that the resdts of their experiments was entirely different, and Mr. Wilson, the manager of the plantiff estsblishmieut, and fone of the inventors of the pstented processes, gve similar evidence. They tated that the introduction of 1 superhoeated steam' was an immense improvement in the manufacture, and that it had been exclusively used ever since its discovery in the plaintiffs' manufactories both in London, ad Liverpool, in which Mr. Wilson sad he believed nearly Ha0 tons of candles and smightlights wonld bh made Ianthe present year. w Mr. HILL, avO., for the defendants, contended that there had been no infringerent of the plaintiffs' patent. With respect to the first pont, he contended that the steam was not introduced ifnto the defendatio till e in minutely Atohea.andmenbuttu-s Jet; n t the proem carried on by the dfendants was byt sufheated steam" an 1d not by "a Euperheated steam" as alleged by the pfaintiffs. Several scientific men of eminence were examined on behalf of the defendanthe and stAto d their opinionL that in the defendantso process the steam iwas mot admitted into the oiy matter "in mainuty divided stream," but by a tube terminating near the bottom of the stl wth acont cavendisk,and thatthe eflect was to cause thW temto emechanicallyinixed witLls the oily matter, which was then forced towards the aide of the still, and so prevented thecarbonizationofthe oiy matter. They also statedthat theyhad examined the delendahta s apparatus, and had eam it used to distih by ismbheated steam," and they considered the product so made was'better than when the damper was drawn. out and-. "superheated steam" o was used. Mr. Bauwen, the minae r of the defen. dants' company, and several.,Of their worm en, distinctly contradicted the evidencegiven by Hastings and Murphy as to the rode in which defendants' manufpcture was conducted, and evidence was given to show that the cell of steam pipes, which were ordinary iron gas pipes, would not have borne being kept at a red heat, as stated. Mr. HiLf , Q.C., and Sir F. T sreGn severally addretedo t ihe jury for their respective clients. Lord CAasrasnn in summing u the evidlence, sAid, the uestions to he decided were entirely for the jury, and.his ordshmp thought, from the atttion which they had paid to the evidence, they 'were fully competenLt to determfine them. The first question wasbas to the novelty of the patent of 1842, which tne defendants said w4 bad, because they had claimed onemprovementnot nowirdisputerwhich however was not new. The ncry-expressed their opinion on this point in favour ofthe plintfs Lord CAnSrBELL said, there would, then, be two qaestions for their consideration,-whether the defendants had infringecl either or bothi the patents of 1842 and 184. The patent of 1842 related to the introduction of steam into the oily matter "in minutely divided streams," and the jury must say, upon the evidence, whether or not the method used by thedcefendants was substantially the samie as that of the plaintifs, and find their verdict vceordingly. With respect to the patenit of I8M the jury would have a mrore difficult and painfuil quest-ion to determine. That a,tent referred to the use of what was called "1superI'eatd steam," instead of the previous mnethod of using " sublheeted steam, "in theprocess of distillation. On that point the evidence was of the mnost conflicting charater, and therefore most proper to be determined by a jury, which in such cases was the best tribunal ever inventedf by the wit of man. If the platntiffs witness, IHastings and Murphy. spoke the truth, the defendanLts bad an p ported their case by a systemn of conspray and perjury such as was never before witnessed ; but thir evidence was met by the direct evidence of Bauwen and his workmen, as well as by that of scientific witnesses The jury must say whether they believed Hastis and Murphiy on the one side or Bauwen and his men onVtie other. His Lordship observed that there were doubts andadifficulties on both-aides. If the jury believed Hastings and Murphy they ought to find for the plaintiffs; but if they believed the witnesse for tho de~ fendants they ought to findl for the defendanti. At 6 o'clock the jury- retired to consider their verdict, anci had not returned at the rising of the Court. (Sittings3 at AHis-i rius, before Mr. hustice ERLL andi a s.eecf4 Jury.-) The Court was occupied the whole day in trying a question -whether a baLnkrupt committed an act of bankruptcy on the 6th or the 8th of September. TEX SPECIAL JURtY. Several jurors who did not answer were fined fit. upon its being announced that one of the cases had been withdrawn, and that the special jurors summoned in that case need not be any longer detained, one of the special jurors said he had been summoned to attend; was not the plaintiff obliged to take a verdict and pay thejury ? Mr. Justice ERLa said the case had been withdrawn for the resent sitting6, but most probably at some future time he slou1d have the pleasure of meeting the special jury. He fully entered into the feelings of the special jury, but more especially the commcn jury, in being brought from their homes for no pinpeos. They came to perform a most mmportant duty, for which there was no remuneration. Hfe bad no power to assist them.

THE CONNAUGHT BANGERS. hTORTSMOUTER, FRIDAY. To-day this distinguishedi regiment (the 88th) were pro. sented with new colours on the eve of their embarcation for the seat of disturbances in India. The 88th mustered In the following force upon the parade ground4 field-officers, 8 captains, 21 lieutenants and ensigns 7 regimental staff, 41 sergeants, 20 drummers, 760 privates; 871 of all ranks, under the command of sieutenant-Colonel G. Vaughan Maxwell, C.B., L.H= Besides whom, Lieutenant-Colonel E. H. faxwell, and Captains Brown and Beresford also received the Legion of Honour for service in the East. There were on the grotnd 290 of the 88th wearing the Crimean medal, besides 35. officers. At 12 o'clock the regiment was drawn up in line on Southsea Common, together with the 7th Fusileers, aud the 19th Regiment. Of course there -was a briliant assemblage of ladies and of the resident gentry and the officers of the united services from the Port Admiral, Sir George Seymour, and Lieutenant Governor,Major-Genemal Breton, downwards. The day was fine. At 10 minutes past 12 Lieutenant-General Sir Wiliam Codrington, C.B., arrived on the parade ground, escorted by Assistant-Quartermaster-General Wright, of the south-west district. Sir Wiliam was received by Major-General Breton anda brilliant staff, comprising ColonselFoster, RE., Aide-de-Camp to the Queen, Lieutenant-Colonel Lake, C.B., L.R-, Brigadier-General Shirley, C.B., L.H. Major Nelson, B.M., Captain Craster, A.D.C., Town-Major Breton, and numerous other offiocers. Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffries, (l.B., and Lieutenant-Colopel Brown, late of the 88th, were also on the ground, and many of the officers late of the regiment. The troops gave the general salute. General Codrington immediately proceeded down the whole line in front and rear. An escort was detached from the 88th, consisting of the Grenadier Company, commanded by Captain Baynes, to take the new colours to the ground, which was done, the band playing the regimental air "St. Patrick's Day." The new colours were then. placed upon piled drums in the centre of a square, three sides of which were formed by the 88th, the 7th and 19th being on their flankl in quarter distance columns. The XRev. BN Milner then blessed the oolours in a' appropriate prayer. Sir W. Codrington then advanced, and, talng the Queen's colour from thesenior major(the Hon.Jobn J. Bourke), presented it to Ensign Walker, the senior ensign of the regiment, wvho received it kneeling. Sir William then took the regmental colour from the junior Mfajor (E. G. Xaynard) :a4 presented it to the second senior ensign (Fox), who remained kneeling while Lieutenant-General Codringto iniade a speech appropriate to the occasion. The enaigna then rose, and Colonel *axwea expressed the thanks of the - offipers arnd menfor the honour conferred upon them. The colours then took their place in front of the escort, vwhi-h then wheeled so as to face the regiment, which, -with the escort, presented- arms to the new colurs, after -which the new colours were trooped throigh the line, the -officers and colouts being'in front and the eicort one rank lbetween the ranks and the other in rear; On arriving at the centre the new colours took the place bf the old ones, .which tben fell in with the escort and -a=rched to the right .of the regiment. After havingbeen narched up in front -thay were marched' off the field te the btune f "Auld Lang Syne," and plced over the seat of he president at Iollingsworth's Rooms, wvhere about 400 guiests were entertained b the-colonel and of ficers ofthe 88bh at a supetb repast.
NATIONAL COLLBURIQNS IN SWTsAiD.-A return was,ordered by the House of Conmmons a sho-t time since showing how far, in the diffetent collections of works of ar., objects of historical interest or of science, in Scotland, the rule has been observed of attaching to. the objects of art a brief aocount thereof. The very deslrable practice of .ap. pending a descriptive label to each article or picture appears to be sd.pted at the Royal Btanical Gardens inEdinburgh, boe Roy Society in Edinburgh, the.Board of Trustees for Manufaatures in Edinburgh, and the Museum of Natural History in the Univeisity of :Edinburgb. In iEolyrood P-Lace, however, the old objectionable system of catalogaes is zetained, the pictures and objects being merely nun-tdered <inceference to tho catalogue, which is, of course, to be aid for). In the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle, at Lin&alatgow 2alhe, at Glasgow Cathedral, and at various abbeys in £cotlaid, the curiosities are shown by keepers, who not only £harge wisitors for admission but sell " guide-books." The propriety of affixing concise but sufficient descriptions of all objects of art exposed to public vie sr has already been urged in eoinexion with the great Exhibitioa at Manchester, and the quesdon, as far as the national collections are con. cezned, is here, at it s,ere, forcibly thrust upon the atten. tion of the Govermnent, The paper was moved for by Mr. £waxt, MIf,P.
ELECTPJIDS 4JO,ImMTTBES. -. MAYO (COUSTTY). Tha committee mat at U1 o'dook, wlteonthe eross-esavineation of Archbishop M'Hale by Mr. M. Smith on behalf of Mr. Moore was regumed,. his examination in- chief by Mr. B. James on the part of the petitioner having been oon - cluded on Thursday. The Archbishop commenced by reading a p.Astoral letter which he had pqblished to the clergy of his diocess ppioius to the election. It referred at considerable length to tie clection about to take place, and to the duty-of the Rom%n Catholic landowners towvanl their teniantjry, and conolmded by exhorting the clergy, whatever might, be the issue, to comport themselves with the wvndom belonging to their holy station, and to breathe forth from the uanctuary the calm and holy spirit of peae upon the troubled *aters by reminding ise eleotorsthat the clergywere engaged in stretch. ing out their hands for the cause of relihion. and social order,sand by depreoting riot andintoxication. Cdlonel NoRynasked in WhAt paper thispastoral had been.ptblished! The Archbishop.-In the Freeman's Josrnel Colonel NoRum-Did it ever come to your knowledge that 'the clergy of your diocess had not acted up to the Advieo you gave them in the pastoral a The Archbishop.-No. 'Oross-examination continued.-I nerer disguised my opinion that Colonel Higgins ought niot to be supported becauso he had -broken his pledges, but I never mentioned 'his name from the altar. I am sorry.to say that in 1852 1 ,supported Colonel Higgins. I votel for Colinel Higgins and Mr. Moore because the profession then made by Colonel T(iggins wa; in accordance with my: opinions. Colonel Higgins promised to belong to the independent Irish party. A meeting took place at which three archbishops, four bishop, and a great number of the clergy were resent, which expressed the opinion that the formation of a P.ir. liamentaoy party -was the beat means, under leaven, ol securing the rights of the Catholics of Ireland,: and of obtaining the repeal of the obnoxious-laws.. 'At that time, it 1852, Colonel Higgins professed to be in fAvour of the repea] of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill and of a measure of tebnn right, otherwise he would notha.vd been fsupported 'in th( county. I have not the least doubt that hs has forfeited the pledgeg he then. made. One of the conditions to which th( gentlemen whohad pledgeAthemselves totheoformatiotof k Irish-party were bound was, that they *ould never be the reciplents of private favours or of patronage from any Mi. nister so long as that Minister .waa hostile -to the measurev which the party desired to carry. Now, Colonel Higginm has-obtained, or has been the medium of obtaining; a greal deal of patronage,. and there can be no doubt that he has oppoBed tenant right, ,because he has supported a Ministew .who treats tenant right with derision. The CHAOLRX.sN observed that le, was.. afraid' tyhoy We travelling a little out of the limits of tht inquiry In dis' cussing the conductof A Goveimment. The witness said he always treated. the )measures of any Government with respect as soon as they-became la*. -Mr. M. SAiTuL.-Did Colonel Higgins beco6mea supportez of the existinz Governmentl Witneas.-He was pledged to an Independent opposition, No one can be more averse than I im to factious opposition. Beneficent measures should not be refused from 'whatevea Government they proceed. But if aly. Minister refused tc sipport those measures upon which the! Catholics of Ire. lanc have fixed their hopes the members of the' rrish part) were pledged to withhold their support from that Minister, I did npt i any waysanction violence on the part of an) persons in nmy dioceess. Scarcely an electiqn has occurred in Mayo in which I have not issued instructions to the clergy and so far from countenancing violence,. if ever a case oi violence were brought before me I should not fail to correct nay, to punish the clergyman proved to have committed it, according to the measure of his delinquenoy. The petition oE.Colonel Higgins is full of grave accusations pgainst m3 cIergy, and if I hesitate to express myopinion,upon them'il is because I feel a conviction, from my intimate knowledge of the character of my clergy, that tjiey are incapable of the acts attributAed to them.. If they had commnitted. sTush acts I should certainly have auimadverted upon their conduct, but I do not believe the accusations. Among the gentlemen who called on me to ask my support at t4e last election was Mr.. anbeit. Sir Thomas Bedington addressed a note tc me witliregard to County Galway.. I told him that Icould not see hiuu o electio4eqring ousiness, and that I should oppose im. Galway Is in my diocess, _nd the pastoral was addressed to the clergy of Galway s well as o; Mayo. I never in the corse of my life said toansy candidate that I would adopt bim, or secare his return. I have told every candidate who has applied to me that I was indifferent to their personal pretensions, and. that the ohbjct of all my endeavours was to secure ths success of a good candidate, and prevent thI people from being sPiH different parties. In 1852 I propbsed. Mr. ..6r,and I should have proposed hin again if I had been onx the.- register. I certainl~y do not think I am proeluded by' my office of machbishop frOm exercising my rights as a citizen. St. Paul exeryehd his rights as a Roman ctizon wven h appeoaedtoCar. Also re -mensbl to the laws and w ho share the burdens of a country ought to exercise their rights as citiean' of thia country, ond no law of the church prevents me froni exercisin those righto.

Witnem-That is ray firSnbelief. If any gentleman had chosen togive his individual vote for Colonl Higgins but had told his tenantry that they were free to vote as they thought' proper, my. opinion of him would be diffqrent; when. I find gentlemen violating the freedom of election by insisting that their tenantry shell vote with them I draw the conclusion that they are actuated by a desire for place or patronage. Colonel No=rrm-Did it come to your knowledge that any of the clergy of your diocess had coerced any of their flock ? Witness.-If there was any such coetioh, it was the effect of the coercion of the.gentry. If the kentry did not violate the laws of theecountryby forcing the csmacienoesof the people, we should never hear of the interference of the clergy. Ten or 11 years ago l:went to Castlebar to support a candidate, and I then made a proposition that a barrier should be drawn round tie huntgs, that the landlords and the bailifli the bishops and the priests should all retire, aul that the people should be allowed to go p to the po11 and vote for whichever candidateg they pleated. That proponition wai not adopted. I wiU tell the committee a circuma,tance that once oceurred at CastlebAr. A voter went up to thepou, w here ie sAw a clergyman.

The Roman Catholic ptssautry of Ireland ought to exercise their own free rill in these matters. * - Mr. O'llI1v.-Don't yofa- think they oughb to be guided by the priests ?

There are many instances in which voters have been- told that they would be driven from their holdings, unless they voted with -their landlords.

Ialso protested against tlhe-payment of the poor.rates4 but I was obliged.to pay them.- I objected to them because I thought it was an unfair burden to throw'ipon th8 people or the clergy when the established church of Irelond has xuch large revenues. Mr. PULL .-Havo yoU ever- suspended oi disniissed pr5ests for uing coercion or violence at elections t WiLtnea.-'No; but I assure youthat if halt of the accusations made, in this petitioncould-be brought- home to any clergyman I should not fail to use all my authority to bring him to a sense of duty, and.to save, the Church from the scandal he had brought uponit. The Archbishop then retited, and Mr. O'MAItLn said thete were some allegations in the petition of'a pereonal natare to Mr. Moore, but he and his learned fziends being. desirouz of separating the questions upon which the ommittee would have to decid frm any personal question, and considering the serio expense wvhich had been already incurred, had determined to close the cae for the petitioner. As witnesses would be called on the other side be would not now sum up his case, Xr. KEAirSAxE then asked the committee to sdjLpriL,'as Mr. r.

Wilison, -Mr. S. Gregory, Sir F. Davie, tad Sir W. P. Gallwey, met for the first tune yesterday. Mr. B. James and Mr. Phinn represented the petitionetsi and Mr. Ser3sant Pigott, Mr.- Venables, and 3Mr. Rodwel appeared for the sitting members. .- Thne petiton. which v aS signed by two electors, charged the sitting members, Mr. A. J. B, Beresford-Hope and Captain E;dward Scott, with bribery, treating, and undue inuluence by themselves or their agents, and prayed that their return-might be declared null and void. Mr.- Pn oened te cae for the petitidners. .Ee said that Maidstono ad been notorious for its corruption.for the lsst70years, and its representatives-had usuallybee persons. of large pecuniary means, who were strangers to the.town4 At the last election Messts. Hope and Scott were ehe i3qn.T servative and Messrs. Lee and IMidmtay were thQ L4be*l candidates. The borough contained about 1,610 eleceors, of whom 574 were freemen. The nomination took OM_ oa,n the 27th of Mbrch, and the polling on the 28th, and the re8ult was that Hope'had: I0 votes, Scott 759, Lee 69, and MIldmay 655. Messrs. Lee and Mifldmay found' dnriiig their canvass that 200 voters would give no promise either .because they were jealous of their indegidelice or because they expected an equivalent, -ot because -theyWere unable to Siake up their minds upon the political qtuestions of the day. (Laughter.) After Meesars. Lee sand Midmay had been for a short time inx the field, Mir. Hope appeared on the Uth of March, and commenced a brisk canvass. Mr. Hope as a Conservative, or rather a semi. Conservative, was a popular candidate, although his peculiim high chulrch views were rather opposed to the Protestant feeling which prevailed in tho borough, and it 'was believed logt him several votes. He would now endeavour to show the committee by what means Ar. Hope had obtained his majority of 122 votes over Mr. Lee. There senmed to ie different modes of corruption peculiar to different places, and bribery was carled on at Maidstoue by mneansof prq mrises to be performed at . future period, when it was too late for Parliament to Interfere. A societyjrexistedTin MaIdstone called* the Constitutional Society, which exercisea great influence int Pirliamnentaty and municipal elections,' and -soon-after Mr. Hope entered the field he attonded- a meeting of that society, at whlch he was reported to have .said, " With reg ard to- you and me le know how -to earr_ . the election as we like, li- ho woe iio and when we like." Words of this kind coming from a man of Mr. Hope's wealth and popition were likely to cause corpt electors to believe that they would be paid for their votes. AMr. Hope lodged at -the Mitre Hotel, but the business of the election was carried on at the Bell and at the Star Hotels, and at the house of a balker ramed Amos. He acquitted the sitting members per. sonally of bribery, but he would show that their agents badr made promises of- money to voters. A man named SturgisP now living in Bermondsey, but formerly a - baker Or Maid. stone, was In the town at ehe eime of the election, and ioad a promise made to him by a Mr. Goodwin of 201 if he would vote for Mr. Hope. Another voter named Dulwich was told at the time he was canvassed that if he was a good Conservative, and voted for the Conservstve candidate, he would get 51. ; but if he was a blue he would geb nothing. As Dulwich refwsed to give his promise another person named GilLian canvassed him, and said that if he voted for Hope and Scottbhe would never regret it. Duiwich did vote for Hope and Soott, and after the election Gillhm met him. and spealing of the petition which had been presented,said he had hoped that they should by thattime have squiared'p all their supporters. (Laughter.). Another voter was toldthat he would not be offered any money, but that if he voted for Hope and Scott "- it wotld be aU right." A man named Turner hadbeen told by Marly, an agent of the sitting members, "that if he wouldmakeup his mind, and let him know7 the figure, it should be all right." May had also offered 61. or 101. to a voter named lamb. The price of votes appeared to vary from 51. to 151. The earned counsel then stated various instances .of treating in hotels and publichousas engaged by the sitting members. With regard to the allegations of undue influeuce, Ithey would be abandoned, as he was not in a position to prove them. If, however, he succeeded in proving the agency of the peasons whose nameg he had mentioned as havingoffered bribWsto the voters, he thought the committee Would have no hesitation in unseating Messrs. Hope and Scott, Thomas Adnutt, who -had been employed as a wailf at the Bell Hotel during the election, proved that the Coiter. vative party had taken a room there which bad been visited by x, EHope, Captain &gott, Mr, Gilliam, M. WiqkbAca and MLtr. MoUnckton. Two other ro0r0s were taken-& fewdas fore the election. Incro&s.exan4nation he gaid that these roomnk were the ward committee rooms of the Constitutional-Seciety. Sove. -ral of the people, who visite the rooms belongedi ta that society. Edward Morris, a sawyer, and an elector of the torotgh,. said that Marlsi*d come to him at 8 o'clock on the night of the nomination, and asked to beallowed to put hia name down. 'He said, "Yoa kad better let me put dowi: yoa same. ]ir. Hope hasgot plenty of money; there isisno mistake about that." 'Witness mid he had never seen! a*nry thing of it,- when. Marly replied, "You may not-,tros. theblues. but our side always has it. Idare not offer our anything nowr, not even a pint of.beer; but ifsyt'tbing is left in nfy hards, I ilways set it right " Witness de¢lined to promise, and Marly left. The next morning,' between 9 and 10. Marly ccaed on him again. Witness said be would be ready r hlf an homu , and Marly left. Before he returned witness voted4 for Lee and Mildmay. John Fowler corroborated the statement of the last ptness, havizg been present when the conversation with aly took place. I George Turner, a sawyer, stted that 3arly haA called on him, and asked for his vote. Witnes2 said he had proniiased it.. Marly- said, "Never mizd. Make up yotlr mind, and -whate-er your figure is I will niake it all right" On tEe daly of election harly wGS very busy taking voters to the - Evidei- vas then given with regard .to Lamb and ~tutrgs but Sho case ot those voters was not concluded At. the tim of the adjonrmnen6 oi the commniittee, OXFORD) (CITY).
