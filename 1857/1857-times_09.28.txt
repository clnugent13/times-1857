CARDINAL WISBMAN ON THB INDIAN X MUTINIES. -Sp Yesterday morning a pastoral letter from Cardinal Wiseman was read in all the Roman Catholic places of worship in tho metropolis, on the subject of the Indian mutinies, directing that next Sunday be set apart by the Roman Catholic body as a day of humiliation and prayer, and that a collection should be then made for the objects specified. His Eminence says :- "A When lately, dearly beloved in Christ, our country Was afflicted with war, we called upon you to pray to the God of Armies for victory and for peace. They caine to u9 in m; aud, scarcely heeding those lesser war which 9= md oar lAst-em frontiers in Persia and in China, we believed that we had before uS a long period of natioual tranquilty, and of consequent prosperity. "And now so soon agait we havo to invite you to cal aloud to the God of mercies that He would spare -as the aidicting and harrowing scenes which have been, and are probably still, acted en our own territories, of which those possibly dear to us, at least our own people, are the victims; ancd that He would once more give back order and quiet rule to the great continent of India. "-Who Will attempt to descrabe the terrible calamity which has overwhelmedus? 'Behold a ihttle cloud came out of the sea like a man's foot,' and while he who beheld it 'turned himself this viay ad that way, behold the hleavens grew dark with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain,' not, als of refreshing waters, but of sore 2n battle, and blood in massacre. For truly had it been merely war with its usual array orevilsthat we had to deplore-had there been suddenly commenced the conflict of brave men In honourable warfare, it would h^ve beea enough to sadden us and to direct our thoughts to supplications for peace. But here It has been the sudden risig of an immense army, subject as much as our troops at home to the Crown of this realm,-aruaed, traiaed, clothed, and fed by the power which there represents it; their rislng by conspiracy, which has silently and darkly included tens of thousands, to break out openly like a plague in separated spot, under one law of cruel perfidy and treacherous brutality. Almost without exception, as you all have learnt, regiment after regiment has mur. dered the officers who had led tbom to battle. and who trusted in their fidelity, till the volley was fired or the thrust was made which laid at the feet of cowards those who Lvin had made them brave. For, transformed by that deed of treachery from soldlers into assassins, thesc hordes of savage muitineers seem to have cast aside the commnonest feelings of humaanity, and to have not raerely resmmed the barbarity of their ancient condition, but borrowed the ferocity of the tiger in his jungle, to torture, to mutilate, to agonize, and to destroy. Nay, if we had imagined to ourselves the unchecked excesses of fiendish fury by which legions of demons let loose against a tribe accersed of God would have marked their progres of devastation, the picture would have fallen short of what has been perpetrated, in a land that we called our oWu aud thought that we had blessed with eartbly happiness, on those whomi many around us know, whom some near us muay have tenderly loved. b "4 It is not our duty nor our wish to detail the horrors of his overthrow of India civilizsation, containing as they do s0 much of whatthe apostle tellsus must nOteven benaamed among -as. Seffioe it to say, that no indignity, uo insult, no ditshonour hag been spared; that nothing which cruelt in its refinement or in its grossness could devise or execute has been omitted from the black catalogueof comrmitted crines; that no regard has been had of the sacredness of age, of the helplessness of womanhood, nor of the innocence of infancy; thlat Compassion, remorse, the ties of Previous obligations, familiarity, and friendship seem to havse lost their holld orn these maddenaed contrivers of total extermination. And many crimes there have been, no doubt, too bideous for revelation-scenes of lawless license and unbridled brutality of which no record has been kept save in the reckonings of Himk who will one day bring to light the hidden things of darknes and amply repay them, A t thLe contemplation Of 'these seenIes of horror the mind stands aghast, and s filloed with stranes aud ierrors, its an> its shifting thoughts inhea depthS of that ever onsistent wisdom which can weave the vilest of men'sdesigns and the blackeit of their actions into What xpiationand what high rwad may hae comet many who, with patience in faith, have endured tormants like to those of ancient maryrshow large a new band of rinocente may have beel wvelcomed in heaven by their forerunners of Bethlehem, slain even through hatred and fear of the same Christ- hat a swoeping away of the old aed rotten basis of civiliration, that a juster and a purer recon. truchon of it follow, may have been practicable only b iths eravagin' adod.wa a puroegt ind a ofma froul tmshered of hidden rime bor she u i ning sof a wharmer and it brihter sa n mnay have been ethected by the unsparing whirl of thia tempest-in flue, what a second and re-newed prosperity may be ing store for that empire after the marauders 'have rushed un and takon away all and slain it oservants, and a'violent wind has comefrom the side of the deseritand shakeng FtheSou cones of irsphnuse, andgit has fallen upon its bldchilrn bnod thoeyre odeasd '-what, in ne, of boaut and loveliness God may ceuse this new desert bud forth -all these things ge alone ktowetih, but we may pray to Him to gra tran s aud do, "Yet however confident wve may fcel not only of fntura hue of present meroy, tt is so covered with so aspect of acptul sevriy casol mnled wish coi us nof impendin byhdger ir,eats, that our first tnhouagdhWt must i, thtohf propitationgjd .and of calinulg the Divine in.dignation which visits us and tat disant dependepp for transgressions and sins, which if dimly seern by mars may be clear to God's penetrating eye. Soe sudden, so unexpected, so overwhelming, and appa. inbsslon of God, and hs Its reasons buried in His unsearae.i able maind. Had it fAelle upon our forefathers in Cathiolic days one wouald have deen the strets of thi city trodden in every direction, by penitential processions Of mnen anad 'womuen crying out aloud, like David when pestilence had struck thePeoPle. And this is likewise our firstaimpulse, to tur-to God in afffliction and ccntritio t of spirit, to htumble ourselves beeath Hos migty hand, toset our fac to the Lord Gd, an aay o him 'To hee, h Lotd, Suati~ce but o u cofuson f fae,'andthe toentreat Himi to showus aainthe ightof is cuntnancee, to 'scatter the eatleswir deigh Luwar' ad 'elbuke the 'wild basts of the reeds,' For thon, indeed, and thea alone, may -e justly clam. the merCies of the Lord, when we hav eought to a=peae lis wrath. "Such, hen, is the double object -which we propoe to ourselves it thus addresng you. If wve have waited oome time before carrying it out, it has been because a day was approaching which seemed espehiaily suited to our purpose. Accordingly, onthe 11th of this month, we addressea1letter to ch ot our right rev. brethren in England informing him oif c tertion to issue this pstoral, and appoint the firstgundayin October asaday of general supplication and collections for India in this our dioces CC On that day, known familiarly among us as ' Rosry Sunday,' the church publicly thanks God for victories gained over great Infiddel owers threatening the destructton of OCristian natiois. And these victories she sttributes to the humble supplications of her children, coinciding in day ani hour with the aefests of the enemy. Now, these snpplications consisted mainly in the recital publicly of that very chaplet of our Lady which that Sunday honours and saggests. Engaged in a similar contest, let us have recourse to similar means, and exert ourselves to the utmost to Avert the scourgea of Divine justlce faig heavily upon our empire, and to obtain t1at aia which God's blesdng alone Ican effectuay give to men's prowess and fakll ' Let us take our share in the humiliation as we do Inthe suffering. Let usnot hold up our hands and say tbst we have had no part ln the causes of these calamities. They are a common burden, they afflet us and oppress us a1L However unjustly ourreligion may have been treste inuthas distant country by its rulers, however even now it maay b3 unkindly dealt with, howvever we may have been slandered or calumniated there or at homae, all must on that day be forgotten. We are only natives of one country, subjects of one Crown, andwe must take our portion of commou sorrow, drink equally of the same bitterness, anti take upon ouelves the yoke aud budan of our feUow-citizeus, however far awav II With T gour hearts, therefore, tray that God will break down the fierce power of the enemies, and rescue from their cruelty their helpless victims, and that He will grant the consolations of patience to all sufferers, and especiallv to those bereaved of their dear ones; and do not forget ia 'your 'warmest prayers those many spouses of the Lamb, the sisters of va-iouB orders who Lave left their homes in Europe to instruct the children and nurse the sick of those barbarians. Great has been our joy at hearing of the escapa of so many of their number,-'n eseape, in some instances little short of miraculous. But we know not how -many more remain in peril, and we are cestain of tome. " Entreat, then, the God of battles to arise and scatter Rfis enemies, the enemies of His name of His faith, and of His very unwritten law-the law of hUmanity inscribed I, every heart. He can give victory to our standards and conquest to our arms. Beg of Him to strengthen the hands of our soldiers ana fortify tkeir frames against the poison of thle swamp and the arrows of the sun; to fil1 their hearts with the noble courage of the Christian soldier, the chivalry of the valiant knight, not with the ferocity of the 2agan, or the mere thirst for slaughter of the savage. Listen not to the sanguitary cries by which passions sufficietly natural and too likely to be itxflamed beyond the verge of justice by the horrible spectaclus on which they will be fed are urged forward to still madder excitement. Remember that the words 'vengeanr;' and 'revenge' were washed out by the blood of Caivr_ry from the catalogue of man's assumed rights; that the? are reserved to God alone, who wtil make ue of man's justice, stern and inexoriahe, hut lsVing room still To0 aercy t, creep in, for the avengeusent of His o wn violated, law. No we must give a noble example, which will sho.w the very heathen that Christianity has a sacred power 'Io conquer in the soul even the most mighty and most sweat of corrmps human instincts. "1 And pray ye thus for that pecee which will not leave a wilderness for a Idngdom, nor runs for its cities. Let the gulty be dealt with so that the land he purged of its iniquity and then let just laws, and honest prnciples, And fear of God, and large Christian views prevail without op pressfon of the heathen or unfairness to Christians, that so once more the land may be clothed with abundance and its inhabitants abide in safety. And thus shall it be if God so direct the counsels of the nations' rulers as to be wise and moderate abroad and at home, here preventing religious strife, and there not fomenting political convulsions, uniting all here in equality of state, and wiing back the conildence and admiration of the stranger, that so this realm may be staid in lasting peace, and hold its high dominion undispuuA over th sea, axd respectea in every lsand. Then Is prescribed the form of prayer and the order of services for Sunday next, the day appointed for humiliation -an indalgence being granted to all the faithful who sball take pert in certain of the services for the intentions and objects of the day's supplication. In referenee to the collections to be made, his Eminence says,- "As the priests who have generously offered to go as chaplains to the seat of war, beyond a mnost inade9oate slary, are allowed nothing for outfit, or for the provisioa of things necessary for religious worship, the proceeds of the collection will bein part appUed to supply this want. As yet we do not know the extent of loss by deetruotion of ecclesiaseal or conventual property in TIdia, but we know for certain that several religious communities have lost their all. While no doubt they vill receive such relief from public funads as is awarded to individul sufferers, we oaG= easly uderstad that t'ney wi require special ssistiace in consideration of their rehigious state, ot whioh, probably, no regard will be had in the distribution of such funds. To these partioiar wants our attention iwill likewise be devoted. Should your particular charity eaable us to go beyond these specal wants, any su2plus would be throwu into the general subeoription for the relief of the distress in Indiab, towards which many of youhave doubtlesssentyour euabcrtetions."
THE NA VIGATION OF TEE GAVGES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-In reference to the river steamers on the hanges, as no one has taken any notiee of Dr. Beattie's letter, I, as au unbisased person not holding shares in any company, and being practially acquainUted with the Ganges, having com. manded a steamer on it, think it right to offer some remark for the WnormaMion of the publIc. The 6teamers on the river, though a great aceommodation to the public, anCd rendering useful services to the Government, are but IIl adapted to the n%vigltion in consequence of their large dranght of water. So far from the Oriental Inland Steam Company having ignored the existence of these vessels plying, as Dr. Battle asserts, they have quoted the fact of their large dividends, amounting in some cases to 48 per cent., as proof of the remunerative character of steam navigation upon the Indian rlvers, even when ca.rried on by vessels of a less profitable annd efficient character than could now be sapplied; and with vessels of a superior character larger profits than are noW obtained may fairly be expected, seeing that the rield is "e lrgoe that it cannot be easily urerdone. The Ganges steamers, as far as their dranght is concerned 1have little dIfficalty in maing their passages to AiiAhabad in the rains, though their deficienc. in steam. power often leads them to seek a passage through nullahs and other slack water places to avoid the strength of the currelnt, which runs do"n the zrver in some places at th, -ate of eight knots an hour. This alternative, however, ha l not always the effect of saving time, as I havej kown many instancesof vessels touchingtheground in the evening, and on the following morning they wvere high and dry, to lie for an Indefinite period, caused by a sudden fall Ln the river. The evil consequences are felt in the dry season in the delay of going round by the sickly sundubandr, and the time lost by their frequently sticking on the interminable shallow saudbanks that rise in large mounds on one side the vessel soon aftor sbe has fairly taken the ground, which Often renders lightening necessary. So frequently does this happen that I have d arhed smy eagto twice in my way over a portion of the rlver of not moro than five or six miles in extent, which caused a delay of seven or eight days: indeed, on some occasions I have been compelled to din. charge all my cargo and all ray coal, besides emptying the boilers, before any attempt could be made, with any pros pect of success, to get the vessel over the shoaL It would be well to mention that during a large part of the year the Bhaugarette cannot be navigated at all by the detxling vessel It may be an object of great importance to the sUccess of our military tactics to be able to navi gate this river during the ensuing dry season, and this obicet would be accomplishable by means of the steam trains Ewhich the Oriental inland Steam Company proposes to in. troduce upon the Indian rivers, such trains being able to carry large nnumbers of troops and large quantities of storeS on a mueh leIs draught of water than is posbinle by other means I am, Sir, your obedient servant A IVER NAVIGATOR. zupD.

THE HAMi'S2EAD ASYLiUj. TO TRE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-We should judeed be most thankfal to be en. abled to admit into our HAmpstead lIome and Asyluu for Soldier's Orphan Daughters all the pressing applihations made to us by the friends of soldiers who have emnbarked for India, but it is impossible for us to do so, unless the practical suggestions of your kiud correspondent " Clerics Cantuariensis," in yesterday's Times, are immediately adopted. He proposes that with the help of additional subscription; and donatAons we should enlarge our building, &c. I beg to assre him azd the pablc that we are ready if supported by their benevolence to admit double the number of our present inmates. Without the least assistance from thb Government or ihe WarDepartment, or even from the PrivyConofIl of Educa. tion, we have been enabled, by the blessing of God apon our efforts, to found for the bemcfit of the female orphars of the army an endowed asylum on a freebold site the property of the charity. We ate not limited to the orphans of Crimean soldiers, but our doors are open to the whole army, whether of the Qaeen's or the Ron. East India Company's service. In a few days the cry of the British soldier's widow and orphan will again be heard la the land; for them there is no Patriotio Fand, but the orphan daughter may find a home at Hampstead if the benevolence of the country will enable the managers to enlarge their building.

VOLUNTEBRING FOR INDIA. To TIE EDITOR OF TzFl TIMES. 3ia,-1Perhaps the followwng letter, written by me in reply to some onations put by aa officer who is now rai6ing a Volunteer Corps for service in Tndia, mav be deeaine& worthy of a pIe in The Tinmee. I have the honour to be. sir m~am k,o. Ryde, Imb of Wight, Sept. Z. E. NAPIlFR, CGaoneL " lam delighted to hear that you are likely to be engaged In so usefl a manner, both to yourself and to the coantry. I only wish iA 1 wetre tenbe to 5ois aUVtively in eo good a cause, for nothing would afford me greater pleasure than that of adding my mite to the retribution which England 2nut del forth on these rO.an& " I have inamy time had good deal to do with irregniar troops, but they were a different sort from those you wil have to organize and leAd-wild Bedouins, Syrian mountaineer, Rottentots, EYngoew, and other gentry of ' that ille, wbo require very different management and treatmeut from that which you will have to use with English 'irregulars,' for ia that light you 5auat eontider 7our volnteerm I think you are rignt in not asking your corps .more than 600 strong. Your non-comnisoned officers ought, if pos. sible, to be all old soldiers, caable not only of instmocting therank and file, butof giving, when requisite, an occasional hint to such of their offoers as may not have before been Ia the service, of which clas I suppose you will be obliged to have a good many. The more of these non-commissionsd officers you have, I should say, the better. You should also have the powver to promotethem to commissions in your corps for distinguished service when vacancies occur. This would insure their zeal and devotion, which a partisan leAder mut gain at any cost. " Don't worry your men with too much drill; let them be able to act chiefly as light infantry, and as you are an old Light Bob, this will come naturally to you. I would not ever bore them with the ' matual and nlatoon ,' teach them to lod and fire quickly, and (if possibie) well, and to move wit-h arms at the ' long trail,' which is the easiest Vay for unpraetfsed soldiers to handle their firelocks. Bave Eu. fieldrifes,byallmeanRyifyouaDn, but I think I would prefer for the two flank companies, and, indeed, for all, the donble-bmrredlrld e used by the Cape Mounted Ilifles. " I do notknov whether it would be advisable or not to recommend the sword-bayonet for the whole corp, but each man of your two flank companies (which must always be kept complete) ought to be provided with a light, vell tem. pered, sharp-cutting sabre, and with a gauntlet fixed to the 1dft arm to serve on occadon as a shield This equipment would bh of great use in storming the msay mud forts and ' pettabs' 'which will have co be taken separately after the main stream of the rebellion Is dammed up. The ' shield gauntlet' Is lnvaluable in close combat as a defence against the 'talwar,' a native broadsword; and I know of instances so far back as the siege of Bhurtpore where it has proved of great use. I hxd, and believe still have, one made of padded leather, -which I wi send you if I can find it. A. defence of this kind is readily improvised by breaking up a steel ramrod and sewing the pieces between a couple of strips of caNss, hueb they noad be eaay mae akhosne, and so a3 not to Impede the action of the arm or the use of the left hand. "If your volunteers could be provided with revolvers it would, of course, add nuuch to their efriciency, but probably Governmuent would not incur such expene ; fatae de mic=, however, each man might carry a short hunting knife or bowie in his belt; it rould be handy At close quarters, in the crowded bazars, and ofben save the hangnan tronble, for, of couse, no quarter will be either given or taken In the business in whlch you are about to engage. In storming IparUclvarly i scwaing adders are emuployed, or it be requisite to scale walls without them) I would recommend that Your leading company leave their firhoelo behind them, and trust to their swords and gauntlets and pistols, or bowie lnives, as the case may be. When climbing before an enemy nothing is so sukch i. thea 'ay or so sess as a mu3ket; let the ' supports' carry and use their muskets, if you please. "Now, as to dress; every man who has been on actlve service (particularly In a tropical climate) need not be told how superlatively ridioulous is that worn by our troops. Do away with the shako, stock, tight coat, and tight trousers, and substitute a dress I have often recommended (see the avsvl and fililary (aze of, I believe, April, 1856), -a looee red serge or flannel blouse, loose trousers, buttoniug Up both befote and behiRad; a Glengarry cap, writ peak (Ox, Perha, what would be better In India, a broadbrimmed hat of some light and durable material (such a3 those worn by sailors iu tropical climates and made of the leaf of the date tree), with a few ventilating holes and with a piece of white or blue muslin wrapped round it turban fashion, and which at night, while eudisouac, is a capital protection to the face against mosquitoes; and an hour's sleep to a tired soldier Is often worth more than a meaL "fShoes are another Important article in a campaign; perhaps for India sandals like those worn by the Sepoys would prove more serviceable than stout English boots, and a good chaussure Can always be procured by slaughtering a bullock and fitting the foot to a piece of the green hide, which adapts itself to its shape, and will be serviceable for a considerable length of time. . I " P. Z. On reading over the foregoing, which waa hur riedly written, I think that further consideration ought to be given to the subjecti as to whether the double-barrelled rifle be or be not preferable to the Enfield, which hag so much longer range.

!E'HB 7oLu.2rB'T.~x TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sfr,-All yonng Englishmen will cordislly thatk you for your articles on the volunteer question; doubtless, too, they are duly grateful to the "Young Springer" for the "good Ideal of credit" that experienced officor, who opines that "India is fast falliLg from our hands," vmuchsstes to their enthusiaum. The reasoning in his first paragraph would have beea clearer if he had stated whether the officers daily applYing for Indian service ara content to serve as privates, and for pay far below that of an enign. To touch another point, even his cloudy logic, applied to deeper knowledge of nen, might have som4ehow brought him to conclude that if the rough maearal of a county militia cab be drilled into soldler-shape in some 28 days, possibly a greater result might be attainable 'Where tbia drillers Se me. with int.ellects sharpened by education and experiences of life. Surely "1 military duties" and " organization" are no sueb Elensinian mysteries as tho " Young Springer" would imply. But the spirit which at the present emergenay as taken this form of expressing iself is no mere momentary irapusWe, which, climaxing in the offer of service, will die away if rejected; it is rather an instinctive and prelimnaiary protest against oar present army system. None with eyes to see can have failed to discern that this is entering on a transition state. Alredy the tide of public opinionk begis to set more strongly againt the barriers of the purchase system, and the middle classes are waking to the fact that the argumeats which were brought to hear on restricted scholarships and fellowships will apply with equal or greater leverage to military promotion; it is, of course, optional to those in power whether they will direct or resist the movement, bit meanw~Fhile Samson's hair Is growing beyond the power of the newest ted tape to bind him. The present appears to afford a first-rate opportunity for trying how a new prindple will act. Is it not ISkely that with "far field and no favoua' the working of such a volunteer corps as might now be raised would furnish mnuch valuable experience towards eliminating the solution of problems with which our army reformers and their opponents must, sooner or later, grapple? Such a corps would contain im its ranks anl possible combinations of "biceps" and "braine," and the embryo discomfiture of man,y pet little theories now afloat. It may ttrn out that some men are to oethers what the Enfield rifle Is to old Brown Bess, and that a keen and polished intellect Is w well worth an officer's wearing as in the days of Sidney and Raleigh. I cannot bring myself to think so m eanly of the " reglars" as to suppose they would ehow tnwortby jealousy of such an experimental corps, which, if successful, would benefit them likewise; and it is not proposed to raise a collateral army wit2h higher pay and privileges, as " J. 0." seems to fear. But if anything is to be done, let it be done qnickly. Such a trial could never be made cheaplier than at this time, when war would apply the really straining test. Why cannot Government offer some terms to the crowds of gentlemeu who are game to acept any fair chance ? Lord Pan. mare might make up a bhg of volunteers much greater than any he will get of grouse. We don't expect to make our fortunes out of the pay, but let them give us a uniform we can fight in, good weapons, bhrd work, plenty of fighting whereverit is to be had, an opening to those wbo can win it, and trust us for the rest. I enClose my ca=d, end. haSe the honoTr to remain, Sir. our's obeiently. ANOTHER OXFOP ' GRAVUATR. epe. 2a.

MONYBY-M4.KT and OITYI2JTLBNVOB. Saturday Evening. In tho absence of the expected Indian news the funds throughout the day have again remained ,without even a fractional change. Consols were quoted 90 to i for money, and 90j to s for the 14th of October. India Stock left off at 210 to 212, and India Bonds 24s. to 17s. discount. Exchequerbills still continue at the discreditable point of lOs. to 5s. discount. The foreign stock-market has been inanimate, the only transactions marked on the official list being in Mexican at 21 and 21& ; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 94i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64t. TLhe final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68E. for noney and G8f. 25c. for the end of the month, showing a further average improvement of threeeighths per cent. This rise has been accompanied by a rumour that the Bank of France are about to lower their rate of discount, but, although they are understood to have contrived to increase their stock of bullio-n during the past week or two, it seems incredible in the face o' the artificial and costly means by which alone this is accomplished that any measure of relaxation can be contemplated. About 28,0001. of gold was sold to the Bank today. At Hamburg the rate of discount has advanced to 6& per cent. The Board of Trade returns for the past month, issued this morning, continue to exhibit a steady growth in the commerce of the country. As compared with the corresponding month of lasb year, there is an increase of 885,5131. in the declared value of our exportations. This has been generally diffused, and there is scarcely an item of any importance on the unfavourable side. A slight diminution in the shipuments of cotton goods is accounted for by the cessation of consignmnents to Calcutta, the total to India during the month being scarcely more than a third of the quantity sent in Auguat, 1856. Still the aggregate despatched to that market during the present year shows an augmentation. In the present case it is to be remnarked that, while there has been a falling off to India and China, a most satisfactory increase is observable to the United States and Brazil. Thus, owing to our world-wide trade, when one market is affected the result is, at a little sacrifice, to improve our intercourse with others. The following table shows the exact increase or decrease under each head:- DECL&RBD VALUX Ol EXPORTATIONS. The total of our exports for the first eight maonths of the year has been 84,666,7181., showing an increase of 9,976,784., or nearly 12 per cent. The changee have occurred in the following zaanner:- Io?easa.

With regard to imported commodities, the consumption of articles of food and luxury has presented no material variation. The use of cocoa and sugar seems to be diminishing owing to their present prices, but although the latter is now showing a falling off, the quantity taken during the year has been rather in excess of 1856. As compared with 1855, however, the reductioa in the consumption both of cocoa and sugar has been vory great. Tea xnd tobacco still figure for an increase. Spirits and vine show a decrease, but the latter is only on the nonth, not on the year. In wheat, flour, and Indian ornthe diminution has of course been very coniderable, bat the effect of the alteration has been oartly counteracted, as far as the money-market is 'oncerned, by rather large arrivals of other deeriptions of grain. Subjoined are the qua ltiGiea of proviaions, dcs, inported and taken for home consumvtion:- The rucellansot imports appear to have been on average seale. Dyes and dyeing stuffs show a aecrease in rRost caee, especially in that of indigo. hidee and timber there has been a continued ncrease. The arivals of palm oil, likewise, are ully maintained. In olive oil there is an ninter- (pted decrease. Metals have presented no material ationa. -The subioined note aeems to indicate that the .%atoms' authorities are faltering in the course for kromoting the eonvonience of travellers which lately gaiDed theui cradit : ' i,Teon Ia aow setting In wrhen travellers and oSirbTegi to return is large numbers from the continenit ~tter~esoe eomss nsve.saz that every erertiou should be ,bsde on. the part of the varlotu railway and stvanmbot corn. panies, as well as the Customs anthorities, to provide such accommodation as may be required under the inoreaeed desnands likely to be maade npon them. " With this view the South-Eastern Company are desirous of running tidal trains, so as to arrive at all hours of the day, aS well as during the night. Hitherto, since the tystem of examining the baggage at London-bridge has been carried out no tidal trains have arrived at that terminus before 4 p.m. This is owing to the belief, on the part of the company. that if the traiDs arrived before that hour in the day the Commissloners of Customs would not permit the baggage to be examined. "Under tbis impression the company have prepared their time-tables for the next month (Oceober), by which they have arranged for 35 tidal trains to arrive during that period at London-bridge. But it appears that by 15 only of those trains will the public be entitled to the privilege of registering the baggage through, as that is the namber which will arrive at London-bridge after the mystic hour of 4p.m. Thus, again, and at this period of the vear, too, when it is most needed, the travelling community is likely to be deprived of the benefits resulting from that system which has given such universal satisfaction. " According to the accoun' given by the railway authorities they themselves are not to blame. They sav it is useless to register the baggage anless it can be examined at London-bridge before 4 o'clock p.m., but that the Customs' authorities, to whom they have applied, will not provide the accommodation necessary, nor grant permission for this purpose. On the other hand, it is understood that the Commissioners of Customs do not feel themselves authorized by the conditions of the Treasury order to do so. "But why should not the baggage be examined after 4 p.m. as well as before that hour? In the Treasury order there is no line drawn, the only condition being that if the company should fail to carry out the new system in all its integrity, so as to give the public the full benefit of it, the privilege would not he renewed if again applied for. And i,ow, whea the company muke a move in advance, in order to extend those advantages as much as possible, they are stopped short by those who bound them to develope the system as far as lay in their power. "There surely must be some mistake in tbis, It can never be tbe intention of the authorities so to trifle with the public. The conveaience of the officers of Customs and the expense attending the new arrangement are matters of no momer.t when comnpared with the general pnnciple involved. The great object in suggesting this plan in the first instance was to establish a system which would afford every facility to the publio, and promote to the fullest extent the most simple method of protecting travellers from the disgraceful frauds practised at the ports of Folkestone, Dover, &c. The fact of so nmany people availing themselves of the arrangement Proves the satisfaction it gives; and, if not interrupted by those who are guided by retrograde notions and illiberal Ideas, it is one which sooner or later must be extended to aU routes in direct communication with the continent. This is the tendency of the times- the decided wish of the public. Who, then, will take upon himself the responsibility of opposing it I " I am, Sir, your obedient servant, " OBSERVER." The following is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week:-At a meeting of the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee explanations were given as to the circumstances tbat had led to the breaking off of the working agreement with the Scottish Central. BesolutioLs were passed to convert the remaining part of the second-Cass debentures into a 5 per cent, guaranteed stock, and to sanction working and other agreements with the St. Andreaw's, Kinrosashire, and Leslie Railway Companies. The dividend declared at the neeting of the North British was in accordance with the report. It was stated that the rollig stock and permanent way are in good working order, and that the floating debt is in course of being paid off. It is proposed to enter into arrasgements with the parties interested in the North British and Hawick and Carlisle Junction Railway to carry out that scheme, with a view to defeat the rival plan proposed by the Caledonian. It was resolved to apply for power to convert the I-eith and Portobello branch, now worked by horses, into a locomotive line. The Scottish North-Eastern report states the available balance on the Aberdeen stock to be 9,2291., leaviDg, after payment of the dividend on the preference shares, a surplus of 9291. On the Scottish Midland the sum applicable for dividend is 11,0461., out of which a distribution at the rate of 3 r po cent. per annum is recommended. The accounts show an increase in the revenie from goods and minerals, and a diminution in the receipts for conveyance of cattle. The Selkirk and Galashiels Company propose to apply for power to raise 5,0001. additional capital. At a meeting of the Kinrossshire it was agreed to proceed with the construction of the main lines only until the capital should be more fully subscribed; at present but 24,0001. out of o3,0001. has been taken up. The di ~dend recommended on the Forth and Clyde Junction is at the rate of 2 per cent. The receipts show a slight falling off, owing to the withdrawal of a portion of the coal traffic. The chairman of thie Buffalo and Lake Huron has issued a report in which it is stated that for their present capital the shareholders will secure 162 miles of well-built railway, with a probable traffic of from 3,0001. to 5,0001. a-week. No diffioulties exist in taking the railway down to Goderich Harbour, 'with a vievr of participating in the through Lake trade. The progress of the works froni Stratford to the above town has been delayed by frequent rains; it is hoped that this section will be opened by the lst of January. The report of the lrish South-Eastern proposes to make a distribution of 4s. 3d. per share of 121. (rather more than at the rate of 3i per cent. per annum). The traffic returns exbibit a favourable increase over the corresponding period of last year. At a meeting of the Yarmouth and Haddiscoe the works were stated to be progressing as fast as possible. It was resolved to raise 25,0(01. on debentures. Meetings have been held with the view of forwarding the construction of the foUowing new lines ; -from Peebles to Innerleithen down the Tweed, Waveney Valley, and Nenagh and Castleconnel. The resolution for winding up the Geelong and clallarat Company has been confirmed at a special meeting; ld. per share will be returned to the shareholders. Another joint-stock undertaking, the London and West of Ireland Fishing and Fish MIanure Company, established with a capital of 50,0001. only last year, is announced as about to be extinguished either by a voluntary or compulsory winding up. The prospectus profeseed themost anxious desire on the part of the company to avoid raising undue expectations and therefore, with regard to profits, merely hinteQ that about 35 per cent. might be expected from one branch of operations irrespective of other sources; but a petitioning shareholder in the Court of Bankruptcy now affirms that three-fourths of the paid-up capital have been lost or brcome unavailable. The statements hitherto, however, are merely ex pare, and even the complaining parties do not allege anything against the directors but mismanagement. The original list includes some persons whose honesty of intention would not be doubted. It also comprises the name of the Hon. W. Napier, who seems free from reproach in the matter, since he not only resigned before the commencemeuit of operations, but, as appears from the subjoined communication, addressed a letter to the secretary, urging the board to guide themselves by principles which might be followed with advantage in all new eniterprises:- " 2, Old Palace-yard, Westminster, Sopt. 26. *Sir,-I remark in Tke 2'ines of this morning the pro. ceedings in the Court of Bankruptoy on the petition for an order to And np the London and West of Ireland Fishing Company. *- The failure of the enterprise is attributed to the directors con.mencing operations before the capital had been fully subscribed "- My object in addressing you Is simply to state that I was a provisional director, but that I withdrew in October or November, 1856 before the commencement of opera~son, asmy oner usinss aocatons idMnt per~m tions, as my other business avocations did not permit me I to give sufficient time to the duties of the position ; and to ask your obliging perusal of the annexed copy of a letter addressed by me to the secretary of the company on the 24th of July, 1856, and which I submit to you as evidence of my seDse of the responsibility which attached to the hoard of directors.

"'I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 23d of July, and I regret very much that I am unable to attend the board meeting to be held this day at 1 p.m., having to take part in a general meeting of shareholders elsewhere. Under such circumstances, and believing that the business which is tocome under the consideration of the directors to-day is very important, and remembering that the early steps of a uew association, as this in which the directors are embarked, are those which should'be takenwlth the greatest caution, as permanently affecting for good or evil the future of the undertakdng, and considering also the responsibility in every respect devolving upon the first directors of the company-self-elected, and therefore, until after a general meeting of shareholders, doubly amenable to the criticism of those interests the management of which they have undertaken,-and feeling sure that the body of gentle- men associated together at tho board under their distln. guisbed chairman can have but one opinion on this sub. ject, I take the liberty, as I cannot attend in person to-day, thus to express my views upon one of the questions which wIa nndoarily come under the con sideration of the chair. man and directors to-day, or at an early meeting, viz.

"' I am awfare how desirable it is that a nucleus of operation sbould be established before winter; but the directors have doubtless kept in view also the necessity of not usndertaking any outlay whatsoever in this respect until the capital of the oompany shall have been fully subscribed, or nearly so, and the deposit paid, and that when a good client8/e fully able to pay up their calls shall have been secured, then even for this season the working establishment in all its departments should be kept down as low as possible and as necessary to test the probabilities of su¢ces3. F or this reason, therefore, I believe the board will resolve not to put onc any contracts for building vessels, boats, &a., and for supplying gear until at least three-fourths the capital sball bave been subscribed and the deposit paid, irrespective of subsoriptions calculated to proceed from contrators to the company, and that when tbree-fourths the capital be so subscribed atd paid on the outlay be limited as much as possible for this year, and any operations undertaken be confired as much as practicable in area. "'It is oily when experience shall have been gained that extensive operations on a larger area could be adopted with suzcesR. I1 et will be remembered by the boardthat, irr-ipectively of the individual considerations which would actuate each director rnder any ircuimstances, and be productive of extreme caution, the Legislature in granting large facilities for the extension of commercial enterprise under limited iability anticipated and provided for an increased prdeuce and an augmented responsibility on the part of the directors of sunh associations and partnerships. " I Sir, I have the honour to request that you will be good en,ough to place this letter in the hands of the Chairman, General Sir John Burgoyne, and that the same may be read at the fAit meeting of the board.

THB GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY ACCIDENT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir,-In the accont given in your columns of this most lamentable matter it is supposed that the accident was pro t ably caused by the breaking of an axle. As a formal in. vestigation will of course take place, I beg to state a fact in reference to the rate of speed of this (the morning express) train, which may, perhaps, help to throvr some light uoon the matter. Having come up to town from Manchester by the same train on Tuesday last, I observed that the speed was higher than that of express trains on other narrow. gauge lines. From considerable experience in travelling by such trains, and testing their rate of speed by my watch, I can form a tolerably correct idea whether the rate exceeds 45 miles an hour. In the present instance I was ,atisfied that we were going at upwards of 50 miles, but as the motion was exceedingly easy, with very little osclation and only an occaslonal sudden jerk, I paid no further attention to the matter at the moment. But, hap. pening shortly afterwards to look up from my book as -we were pasting a station, I was struok by the tapidity with which we rushed past it, and took out my watch to test the speed by the mile-posts. We performed the next mile in 65 seconds, or at the rate of 55 miles an hour. I tried another mile shortl3 afterwards, noting tha number of seconds to each quarter of a mile, and found that we did the mile in 63 seconds, or at the rate of 57 miles an hour. Some tiine after this, in consequence of some obstruction on the line, the train was brought to a standstill for about 10 or 15 nminutes. Whether the driver was desirous to make up for the time thus lost (a dangerous practice, much abused on many lines) I cannot say, but certain it is that he soon attained such a speed that I was for the third time induced to test it. I found now that each quaTter of a mile was done within 15 seconds and the whole mile In 56 seconds, or at the rate of upwards of 64 miles An hour. Knowing what accidents have happened on otherlines at a much lower rate of speed, I did not feel quite at ease, but endeavourod to fiLd comfort in the thought that the road must be kept in very high order to enable us to skim along it with such comparative ease. I may add, that when my observations of the rate were broken in upon and rendered doubtful by the passig of a train on the other line, or by any other cause, I commenced anew. I have beer thus minute in the hope that the statement may lead to inquiry during the investigation, and that the public may be informed whether so dange'xous a rate of speed is sanctioned by the management, and whether this tahes place in consequence of de comcetition with the L n and iorth.W estern. I enclosemy name and addiess, and am. &c. VIATOR. Sept. 26.
UoNDh,&TnloN OF A :NtUrDEx.-At the Circuit Cout at Aberdeen on Thursday the Lord JusticeClerk and Lord Deas tried a case of murder against John Booth, a hawker, from Old Meldrum. In July last Booth, who had been drinking at night, had his sspicions roused against his wife's fidelity, and returned homo vowing vengeance against her. The wife fled to the house of her atber and mnother, in the sme village, whither Booth followed; and meeting his mother-in-law, Je.I Galloway or Barclay, in the door, he stabbed her mortally. The indictment charged him with wickedly and feloniouslv attacking and assaulting the deceased, Jean Galloway or Barclay, ancd stabbing her with a knife or other sharp instrument in the arme, head, and chest, and wounding her in or near the heart, in consequence of all which, or part thereof, ahe imrmediately or soon thereafter died. Booth pleaded guilty of homicide, but the plea was not accepted, and the case went to trial. Evidence having been led, Mr. Monorieff, vrho defended the prisoner, made an eloquent appeal on his behalf. The jury then retired, and returned with a verdiot of "Murder." The Judge, in an impresive address, aenbenced the prisoner to be hung on the 21st of October.- Scottish Daily Bzpress.

THE LO7VDON AND WEST OF IBELANYD FISH. ING AND FISH MANURE COMPANY. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-As one of the sharebolders "voting for and desirous of a voluntary winding-up," I am surprLsed at the means stlll left (apparently) open by our Legislature, whereby one individual .o disposed Is enabled to run the body of sharo. holders to the expense, annoyance, and vexatious delay of proceedings in a Court of Bankruptcy. To any commonsense individuat it would seem sufficient that the shareholders met and unanimously resolved to voluntarily wind up their own affairs, appointing a liquidator at a fixed rate of remuneration. there needed not the aid of a host of lawyers nor the Coart of Bankruptcy. But it appears otherwise. We do not understand oar own affairs; we arenot competent to pay our own debts. No! nothing but a Court of fankruptoy can do this for us Is this what we expected under the much-vaunted "Limited" Act? Are we at the eaprice of any small shareholder, to be thus dragged, against our wish and interest, into a most expensive court merely to wind up what any commnercial ma would do in a very short period and at smalU expenae?

&2'ATE OF TRADz, MANCHESTR, SM. 26. The inactivity which ham haracterized the market during thet weeok Still continutes, but there has boeen very little Divng way in prnoes. In yarns prces kava recedd jd. per w, .,hich is the extent to which cotton ha grew during the week. Si,aners, however, arein t Oa, are not dis ed to inbite ns b ay frthr ben very little business to-day, but manufactarers are indisposed to make any abatement in terms. They are not insi ting on the extreme rates lately asked, and rhich in fact had never been prac. tically established. The mnarket shows no. pmptoms of depression, and the compartive inactivity previling at present is no- the reeult of a ovor-supplied market, but arises from tho impression that prices, having reched the turning-point,maygive waystillfurther. There are a good many orders in hand that will keep both spinnera and manufacturers basy for a time, BIRMINTGHAM1, SmP. 243. The South Staffrrdshire iron trade remains steady, and the principal furnaces of the district are in active operation. The preliminary quarterly meeting of irortmters, at which the prices of she ensuing quarter will be 4ettled, is to be held at Wolverhampton on Weduesday next, but it may be asserted with confidence that there is little probability of any change in existing rates. There are advocates of an advance, but the more prudent and itfluential members of the trade advise an adherenou to the sale of prices which has been in operation for the Iwet two years. A riso would render the South Staffordshim makers unable to compete successfully with those of the [UJited States, and thus materilly cramp the trade with that country. Stocks of pigs which accumulated during the hot weather are gradually decreasing, and the best ho; mine canuot be purchased at less prices than given at the commencement of the last quarter. The greatest activity Drevails in the coal trade, and an advance is daily expected. Should this take place it cannot, however, be of long duration. The opening of nevr mines promises abundant supplies to the district. The reports from the manufacturing districts are upon the whole satisfactory. The foundries and others employed upon railwav and general contracts are busy. The Londoa and North. Western and East India Comn ie5 are in the market, the latter for large supplies of British and best plate iron, and the former for heavy castings, The Indian mutiny has had hitherto little effect upon the Birminghamx trade with that country. For some montbs past there have been considerable orders in hand for ironwork required for railways in the East, and s yet these havo not beea sus pended or impeded in consequenoe of the outbreak, The large contracts for rail way carriges are proceeding as usual, and the men s busily employed as if the trade was, as it really is, more than ordinarily active. Thoustuds are now employed where a few months ago only a few hundreds were occupied in this branch of local manufact The engine and boUer makers are buty, the greatest portion of their work being for the dockyards of the kingdom. At Wcstbromwich the hollow-ware bnsineas is briak, and the wrought nail manufacture at Dadley represented to be tbriviog. The brassfoundry trades in Birmingham, notwithstanding the late advances in the prioes of material, are better than they have been for some months past, the only drawback to stiUl further increased activity being the apprehension that another rise wiUl be declared by the smelters, It is admitted by the manufacturers that there is difficulty in obtaining supplies, and this is deemed naturally a pretty sure indication that a farther advance is not far distant. The activity of the tin and tin-ware manufaotures here and at Wolverhampton is unabated, and aU the chief establishr'ents are well off for order for both home and abroad. The Admiralty has advertised that on Monday. the 5th of October, they shall be prepared to treat with such persons as may be willing to contract for supplying and de. livering into Her Majets doclkyards allsuch articles of ironmongery, tin, and copper wares as may from time to time be required for the services under a tontrat for 12 months; and tllese contracts, whoever may obthin them, witl, it is considered, add materially to the employment of this district throughout the winter. During the Crimean war contracts for tinned goods, although nominally obtained am Sheffield, were really executed in Birmingham. The military gun tride is actively employed upon olt Ordnance and East India Company contracts, all of which we hear are satisfactorily progressing. The birding gan business is not so active as for two or tbree months past, but the demand, usualy large at this season, is heavier thAn at corresponding periods for some years past. In connexiort with the manufacture of small arms itmay be mentioned that the East India Company is apparently adoptin energetiu means for the efficient supply of aide arms to the troops. The swordmakers are extromely busu, 3ad, as in the case of the gunmskers, anticipate a vast mflux of orders The East India-house solicits tenders for a large number of swords and scabbards. Little new is to be ssid lith regard to the xts of the general trades and manufactures of the town and neighbourhood. Business is usually slack jast preceding the quarterly meeting, but it is not more than ordlnarily so at the present time. The factors represent orders for general ironmongery as encouraging, and those from Scotland and the North of England as more numerous and heavier than at the end of the spring quarter. No foreagn orders of any great extent have been given out during the week. Those brought by the last packet from the united States were less important than expectee, The German trade hs dulLL NOTTINGHAM, Sim. 26. The lace trade Is dull, and although there are buyers for home consumption ln the market, their purchases at present are of a limited character. It is, however, probable that in a few days there may be a better demand. Silk continues at a very high price, as also does cotton. The hosiery trade remains as dull as last week, If not more so. There are a few foreign orders in the market, bat these are only to a small extent. Yarns are firm. There has been a good deal of excitement in the town this week in oonsequenoe of the stoppags of the house of Messrs. Archer and Harris (Americans). Many of our manufacturers (more particularly those engagod in the hosiery trade) are creditors. LEICEiSTE:R, SmP. 26. There is not mtueh alteration to report this week ia the sate of the hosiery trade, there being a fair amount of bua6. ness doing in many branches, laterial is still selling at hgh rates, and manufacturers continue to act with caution in making goods. The failure of the American house of Archer and Elarris wnil be felt by some houses in this country to a considerable exdent. Yarns are very high, LEEMS, .SEPT. 26 The woollen cloth trade In this town and district has somewhat slackened. There is a lull in the demand, aad the manufacturers are not generally running the whole of their machinery. The hands in some of the surrounding manufacturing villages are not fully employed. As the great bulk of the winter goods has alrasdy passed from the hands of the manufacturers into those of the merchants, the retail dealers, and the consumers themselves, and the spring trade has not been much entered upon, tho slackness is not a very uncommon feature, and it rnust not be rearded as a sign of any declension in the trade. Stocks are in a moderate compass, and the tone of the market to-day has been rather better, a fair amount of winter and mixed eoods baving been sold, chiefly in oamparatlvely small quantities. Prices of both cloths and vrools are firm. The price of Indigo has risen a good deal since the commencement of the Bengal mutiny. Some kinds are ls 6d. per lb. higherth&M they were at the sales in July last. HALIFAX, Sm.r 26. There continues to be a fair seasonable demand for piece goods and yarns, but the market to-day has not been quite so busy as last Saturday. Woels are fira in price, but the demand i, not so brisk as it has been. DUBLIN, Sm.r 26. The continued glorious autumn weather-unpalleled in seasonableness and durabUity for very many yeag-is f- vounrable to trade, and, together with the excellent harrest now generally saved throughout the country, has had the effect of encouraging business, which has been moderately active, in some branches at least, during the week. Prices of most commodities of general consumption bave rather declined; while the rates for luxuries-for wines, 1ahave risen considerably, even beyond the recent high standard. The Customs' reoeiptsfor the week to Thursday, 25th September, inclusive, were 16,8751. against 15,6291. last week

LONDON, LFONDA Y, SEPTEMBBR 28, 1857. It is a great thing to belong to a school in literature, art, or politics. Matter, after all, cornes very easy when manner gives no trouble. For a century after POPE began to write poets could sit down in any state of their temper, their digestion, or their finances, and pen didactic poems by the hour, simply because the neatly woven couplet in which they expressed their thoughts was turned off readily and quickly. How easy is it for modern fabricators to produce very respectable Madonnas, -with most meritorious St. Georges and St. Sebastians, or an excellent piece after WOUVERMIANS, with an impossible white horse in the centre ! We all feel that it cannot be very difficult to write a naval novel, or a fashionable novel, now that the model has been given us. So with politics, a man with no previous &at, with no right to speak in the 'name and -with the language of a particular set,| must rack his brains to say and do something original. He cannot hope for eminence by merely continuing the arguinents or seconding the 3motions of somebody else. If he wishes to be a asocial reformer, he must leave Maynooth, or the ballot, or lodginghouses, or juvenile depravity, Mwhich are subjects already appropriated, and varder over the world in search of a grievance. But how different is the position of an hereditary Whig politician I He is the legitimate successor of the virtuous and the wise. He comes of a philanthropic reforming stock. His father and grandfather, his uncles and oousins, his brothers-in-l&w and other matrimonial ,connexions, havebeen fighting the battle of the people for a centuiy. They have been the chairmen of popular meetings ever since meetings were first thought of. They have made more quotations from Csczao, and SoMans, and BURKE than all the xest of the nation put together. In right of these achievements their present representative has an indefeasible clain to be heard on all great questions of morality and liberty. Nay, he may fairly recaU our wandering attention at any time, in season or out of season, to high constitutional subjects, and on education, emigration, representation, and the like his authority is supreme. Be and his friend. axe, in fact, our moral instructors, and, *whatever piay be our duties or predilections for the moment, we are bound to ffx our interest at once on any theme, however exhausted, if an authorized Whig performer chooses to harp on it. An ordinary man would hardly be bold enough at the pre5ent moment to expect to hold an audience in attention by a lecture on primary education. W'e doubt, indeed, whether even the brilliant chief of the Tory party would venture to forego any reference to the one subject which fills the public miud. But Lord JOHN RUSSELL looks with sereue contempt on such concessions to the spirit of the holur. His Lordship appears in public at this crisis of the national history as a lecturer on Sagged Schools and education generally. Only the slightest alilsion to India gratifies the expeetatioII of his audience. Hardly more space is given ito it than to the indispensable mention of the Test and Corporation Acts and the legislation of Lord GIuEY'S Governimient. Yet the hearers listen, and the newspapers print, for the speeches are in the old orthodox style about liberty and improvement, which every ont thinks he ought to admire. Lord JOIN treats of education only to tell us that his views have been much modified since he brought forward his fampus resolutions last year. He now confesses that tha differences of religious opinion and the disagreement as to what kind of religious instruction should be given form for the present an insurmountable barrier to a national system of education. For the present, then, the practice of supporting schools by contributions and the payments of the children must be continued. This fact has, indeed, been clear long enough to a great majority of the thinking men of the country, and hence the readiness with which they have acquiesced in the existing system, and used their best enoeavours to make it successful. Whether the religious jealousy which makes it necessary be creditable or neo to the country is another matter; but the fact is undoubted, and bas been acknowledged by all w.ho are even moderately clearsighted. That it should be admitted at last by Lord JOHN RUSSxLL is satisfactory for his own sake and the sake of the public time. We believe that any renewal of the attempt to establish a national system of education, either secular or religious, either with iio Bible or with the whole Bible, or with certain non-dogmatic passages from the Bible, would be, in the present temper of the people, wholly unavailing. And, as for the future, it seems likely that the presenrt system will grow and be moulded so as to suit the wants of the country. Even now there seems no want of instructors and little deficiency of funds. Those who cannot afford to pay something towards the education of their children are, after all, but a small class, and these are helped by the eteady benevolence of the public. The real lindrance to education is, not want of means, but want of will in the poor. They do not value instruction, or they would buy it for their children as they buy beer for themselves. Unless the Government be prepared to pass measures enforcing the attendance of all children and exacting payment from their parents it may aS well confine itself to giving pecuniary assistance whlere it is asked for, and leave the problem to be solved by the independent action of the community. As to the proposition that a kind of common Christianity should be taught in schools, while doctrines are inculcated at a later age, we wonder how a man of Lord JoHN RUSSEL's experience and acquaintance with English feelings should expect success for such a scheme. The mere notion that any religious party among us would acquiesce in what would be little more than an instruction in the Scriptural morality is too wild for a sober politician's belief. From education Lord JoHN turns, on the presentation of another address, to the question of the Newv Reform Bill. One cannot but think that the veteran Reformer must look with somewhat of irritation on the coiuse of events. It would seem as if all mankind were in a league to effect the postponement of his crowning measure. No sooner had the Wliig Premier conceived it ten years ago than Europe burst into a flame, and Democratic changes were dangerous tbings for a season. When quiet was restored, and the Exhibition of All Nations set the prophets prophesying peace, the revival of the great scheme did not avert the fall of the Whig Cabinet and the triumph of the Tories. Again, in 1853 Reforni was pronmised, anad the execution was for 1854. But 1854 found us engaged in war with the greatest military Power of Europe, and the long-meditated Bill was consigned to the desk of its author. The year 1858 is, in accordance wvith new promises, to fulfil the hopes of Lord JOHN and the nation. But 1858 is likely to find us in the midst of a contest more deadly than the Russian war, with the news of battles and stormings arriving weekly; or at least there will be the whole system of Indian government to inquire into, and the machinery of the greatest province any nation ever possessed to take to pieces and arrange. Lord JoHN, however, after the usual assurance that it has been his "good "fortune to take a part in Parliament in " favour of measures of civil and religious " liberty," goes on to discuss the approaching measure as if no disturbing cause were likely to affect its course. " Gentlemen," says his Lordship, " I believe the time has come-and the Governmient of the day has allowed that the "time has come-when the franchise may be "further extended. . . . You will not doubt, "I hope, that I shall be very glad to see a mea"sure introduced by Government." Now, these sentiments are all very well, and at anotlher time might command the assent due to their obvious and commonplace truth ; but to make them the staple of a discour.e at present is certainly the merest political pedantry. One thing at a time. The Government is at this moment taxed in every faculty to save the empire which our fathers have bequeathed to us ; when that is secure it will be time enough to think of redressing the petty variations in the political balance at home.
It seems conzistent with analogy, with form, and with the invariable rules of English associations, that the proprietors of East India stock, like the members of other corporations, should meet in periodical courts. It is true that there is nothing for them to do when they have come together, except to pass a vote of thanlks to the Directors, who hurry over the ceremony with a nervous anxiety to anticipate any purposeless discussion. There is no dividend to declare, beeause the interest of the ttock is fixed by Act of Parliament. There is no business to transact, inasmuch as the Court of Proprietors has no auithority to interfere in Indian affairs. A meeting of Consols holders to celebrate the half-yearly dividend days might discuss the conduct of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with precisely the same fitness and effect which characterizes the abortive debates of Leadenhall-street. Fortunately, the holders of Three per Cents. possess no corporate existence, and are consequently exempt from the obligation of assuming at fixed intervals a visible form. Parliament has thought fit to maintain the right of the East India proprietors to elect the majority of the Directors. It was necessary to find a constituency for the purpose, and there seemed no reason for departing from the accidental combination which had originated tander a different state of circumstances. The Company had ceased to exist as a commercial body, but the representatives of its members were generally respectable and independent, and the casual nature of their qualifications removed them beyond the reach of political influences. It also happened that many owners of stock were connected with India by commercial or official relations. The body of Directors has for some years past included many persons of Indian experience; and, on the whole, it was thought that, in default of a more unobjectionable system, it was prudent to let well alone. The proprietors have assuredly no right to complain that an important privilege has been added to a guarantee of their income; and for the most part they prudently abstain from any officious interference with public transactions. Yet, like other miscellaneous classes of the community, they include among their number several persona with superabundant leisure and two or three professed grievance-mongers or bores. The consequence is that the Quarterly Courts ztrongly resemble meetings of the Convocation in the good old times, when the Archbishop used with difficulty to impress on his clerical brethren the expediency of separating with all possible speed. Englishmen, habitually tolerant of fictions and of traditional contrivances, are proportionally irritated when attempts are made to convert a conventional form into a substantive right. It would be utterly intolerable that any individual possesecd of 2,0001. or 3,0001. should be able to instruct his stockbroker to buy him, at the market price, a share in the administration of India. The right of voting at the election of Directors is not easily liable to abuse, but the power of influencing the policy of the Government can in no way depend on the possession of a particular description of stock. Even if the Chairman and his elected colleagues were disposed to acknowledge a responsibility to their constituents, the nominees of the C:ow. might reasonably object to participate in the same subordinate relation. It would be impossible to explain the policy or intentions of the Court without betraying the secrets of the Board of Control, a department wholly unconnected with the proprietors of stock. The theoretical anomalies which would arise from unrestricted discussion at LeadenhalU-street would alone far outweigh the seeming inconsistency of summoning a corporate meeting to do nothing. The practical inconvenience of debates in the Court of Proprietors is too obvious to require illustration. Prudent politicians deprecate the frequent or direct 1 intervention even of Parliament itself in the affairs of India; but, if public discussion is desirable, the House of Commons is surely a fitter arena than a meeting of two dozen stockholders. In early times, -when the Company was both a commercial association and a territorial potentate, the proprietors of stock not unfrequently interfered with the Directors in questions of policy and of patronage; but their powers were from time to time restricted at the periodical renewals of the charter, and when their mercantile character was abolished, in 1834, they were necessarily deprived of their remaining authority. Tradition, however, supported by the continued nominal existence in the Court of Proprietors, still attached a facti-| tious importance to the debates of Leadenhall-street. Within a few years it was the well-known custom of some Indian princes and pretenders to maintain advocates, qualified by the possession of the necessary stock, to agitate their claims at the quarterly meetings. The professional philanthropists who undertook the employment took care to conceal from their clients the utter futility of appeals to a body which exercised no political functions. Public servants who have thought themselves ill-used by the authorities in India have from time to time, with less excuse, brought their grievances before the same unqualified tribunal. Knowing that they asked for redress where it was impossible to attain it, they, nevertheless, contented themselves with the opportunity of giving their wrongs a kind of obscure publicity. The causes of the great military mutiny, and the methods to be adopted in suppressing it, are graver questions than the hardships of a dethroned Rajah or of a superseded Judge of the Sudder Adawlut. It is true that these subjects are discussed at every public and private meeting throughout England, but it is highly unfit that they should be openly debated under the roof of the India-house. The bad taste of two or three proprietors of stock may not improbably tend to confirm a delusion which prevails extensively at home, while abroad it is almost universal. A candidate for a seat in Parliament not long since gave utterance to a widely-spread error when he complained that India was goverued for their own profit by a body of joint-stock adventurers. On the continent, and even in India itself, the Company is often supposed to be still a vast commercial association, dividing among its shareholders the surplus revenues of the empire. Debates in the Court of Proprietors have an obvious tendency to mislead public opinion. Halfinformed politicians naturally suppose that a Company which exercises sovereign power must have an actual existence, and that it must, like the Bank of England, be composed of the proprietors who hold legal meetings under the presidency of the Chairman of the Board. The necessary failure of all attempts to extort official information, and the precipitate termination of the proceedings, are attributed rather to the corrupt character of the imaginary institution than to the incompetency of the meeting. It would be well that the habitual orators of Leadenhall-street should find some more suitable occasion for dilating on their grievances, their crotchets, and their projects; but in the meantime it is desirable that the true nature of the Court of Proprietors should be known as widely as possible. The stockholders have nothing to gain by sound policy nor to lose by misgovernment; and having no special interest in Indian questions themselves, they cannot even pretend to speak in the name of others. The Court of the Fishmongers or of the Mlerchant Taylors, or a Chapter of the Order of the Bath, would have precisely the same right and qualification to investigate the reasons of the mutiny; but these respectable bodies would have the advantage of not encouraging confused notions as to the constitution of the Indian Government. It is perhaps unfortunate that the Act of 1853 permitted the continuance of these fictitious meetings ; but, as the absurdity exists, it will be rendered most innocuous by a full explanation of their meaning, or want of meaning. Parliament may in general safely trust the good sense of any consider- able number of persons ; and in the present instance the vast majority of proprietors find for tbemselves on the quarter days some better amusement or employment than attendance at the Court in Leadenhall-street. The idlers and busybodies who make up the actual meeting have a legal right to be present, and even a legal opportunity of making irrelevant speeches. In some future Act it may be thought judicious to provide that the doors shaU be locked before the proprietors assemble. It is by some such gradual process that in England obsolete fictions for the most part pass into oblvion.
Speculations upon the ability of this country to cope with the rebel Sepoys of Hindostan must surely be somewhat premature. It is perfectly natural that other nations should not regard the subject with that absolute confidence which we entertain ourselves, but there cannot be much room for a comparison of two forces when one of them haa not yet reached the field of battle. Up to this moment England has not been near enough her enemy to strike a single blow. RYDER AU used to say that what inspired him with fear of the English was, not the strength which he saw, but the strength which was out of his sight, and from which the former was perpetualy recruited. This power-incomparably the greater Of the two-has not yet been brought to bear upon the mutineers in the smalest degree. If v have succeeded hitherto in maintaining the general ascendancy of Government and d&feating all the efforts of the revolters, except where an isolated and exhausted garrison has succumbed to their numbers, it has been with the means actually on the spot. In the early part of the year the I Qux 's troops in India comprised scarcely more than 20,000 infantry, supported by about half as many European soldiers in the service of the Company. The Native Army of Beegal, including all descriptions of irregulars and contingents, ex, ceeded 150,000 men. Now, if anybody had pre- dicted that this enormous host would revolt against their masters, and that the 25,000 or 30,000 British infantry scattered over the whole of India would be called upon to mako head against the insurrection, and, besides holding the central seats of administration, actuaUy keep the field against the mutineers until aid arrived from England, the chances of our success would Chave appeared forlorn indeed. This, however, has been accomplished. The greater portion even of the Bengal Presidency itself is still in our hands. The Punjab is so completely our own as to furnish u1s with a second base of operations, and though the insurgents are swarming in lawless strength over the North-Western Provinces we are confronting them in their own head-quarters at Delhi with an army which defies their utmost efforts. So far, therefore, the power of England has proved greater than any estimate that could reasonably have been formed of it. We have held India even with the weak and outnumbered army present in the country at the moment of the revolt, though such a result was almost beyond ex oectation. But the real test of our strength is new to come. The question is what we can do when we get into action, not what may happen before action can be commenced. It should be observed that up to the middle probably of the present month Lord CAN_\mG has not had the assistance of a single man from England. AU the efforts of the Indian Government have been hitherto achieved by its own means-aU the reinforcements procured have been drawn from fortuitous or extraordinary sources. The G4th and 78th Regiments were part of the original Indian establishment, and had been despatched to Persia from Bombay. The 5th and the 33d camefrom the Mauritius, a wing of the 37th was summoned from Ceylon, and Lord ELGLv brought with him a company or two of the 59th in the Shannon. The Chinese expedition wil have contributed four fine battalions, and the Cape, we hope, at least as many mnore to the force at Lord CAxNENw'S disposal, but these succours do not include a single bayonet of the reinforcements despatched from this country. Our own stroke-the stroke of England's armhas yet to be delivered, and that its weight is likely to be commensurate with the occasion will ha-e been seen from the details whicl we published on Saturday. Exactly three months have elapsed since the character of this monstrous revolt was plainly de(lared, and in that time we have sent 30,000 troops of all arms on a voyage of 15,000 miles. A few days more wiU see 5, 000 additional soldiers despatchedto the same destination; so that an army of 35,000 men will have left these shores for India since the 1st of last July. An expedition like this, undertaken from the resources of a peace establishment, at an abrupt notice, and immediately after a reduction of our armaments, may naturally have produced some present exhaustion of our means, but it can hardly be quoted in disparagement of our energies, or regarded as an inadequate exertion of British power in the face of the Sepoy rebellion. If, indeed, the balance has not been turned against us up to the present time-if 1,500 British soldiers could march from Calcutta to Cawnpore, and twice as many more succeed in holding their own against the main force of the revolters at Delhi, it is plain that 30,000, 20,000, or even 10,000 fresh troops thrown into the field should suffice, as far as the immediate overthrow of the rebels is concerned, to establish our a,cendancy throughout the whole of Hindostan. Our military capacities may be tested in the efforts required to maintain the armies of India attheir proper strength, and tofill up the voids left by such large embarcations in our establishments at home, but these are points which remain to be disclosed. At present, as far as regards heroism of resistaneo in India and promptitude of succour from this coumtry, we venture to think the shortcomings have been few. The only question, as we recently remarked, is that of time. At this minute, or perhaps earlier, the first reinforcements may have arrived at Calcutta; but the ships despatched at the beginning of July were not of such size or swiftness as those afterwards employed, and a few days will still intervene before the larger and more heavily freighted clippers can come up. It was on the 6th of August, for instance, that the Golden Fleece sailed with nearly 1,000 troops on board, and on the 8th that the James Baines and the Champion of the Seas followed with upwards of 2,000 more; and, supposing that these vessels should accomplish the voyage, as was anticipated, in 65 days, they would land their men about this day fortnight. Before that time, however, it is probable that smaller reinforcements would have been coming in, and when once the stream commenced there would scarcely be a cessation until the entire army had been disembarked. In 10 or 12 weeks from this day 35,000 soldiers, it may be reekoned, will have been added to the army in India, over and above the succours, representing, perhaps, 10,000 more, which other sources have supplied. As forces in war must be estimated by comparison, the prospects of the enemy also should be taken into consideration, and from this point of view our advantages will appear to be enhanced. Reckoning the remainder of the Chinese expedition, and the battalions expected from the Cape, it is not too much to assume that the forces of the Government, even independently of the levies raised in the Punjab, must have been gradually, though perhaps slowly, improving ever sines the commencement of the present month; in fact, excepting for the deductions due to casualties, they would have been very considerably increased. It is little less certain that the strength of the revolters must have been diminishing, and will diminish stilL Their losses, according to all reports, largely exceed ours, and they have no resources on which to draw for Succours. The revolt, in short, is the revolt of the Bengal Army, and the Bengal Army is now accounted.for. Every los inflicted on the rebels, whether under the walls of Delhi, or on the banks of the Ganges, or at any spot or in any form, represents an expenditure of men who are not to be replaced. An army, after all, is a very exhaustible force when not supported by a nation, and the mutineers have never attempted to raise new levie5. The first revolters received and absorbed other revolting battalions, and there was the sum of their resources. Our enemy has been represented by the aggregate of Bengal Sepoys, and as these are fewer in number than they were in May last, the force opposed to us has been declining while our own has been augmented. We cannot shut our eyes to the possibility that other parts of India, hitherto tranquil, may make new demands upon our military resources, and thus again reduce the proportions of our active strength; but if we ,mape these trials we shall certainly be justifLed, in looking without imuch distrust to the speedy and effectual predominance of the army now on its voyage to the Eaat.
That the annual election of a Lord Maycr is not the mere formality which most people imagine it to be the report of what took place at the ?aasion-house on Saturday aufficien-iy proves. It is well known that, though on each succeeding Michaelmas-day the Liverymen of the City of London go through the ceremony of an election, the appointment of our principal civic dignitary is, in effect, determined not by election, but by rotation. As a matter of course the sen or Alderman obtains the honour, if there is no imputtion against his character. The elective principle is thus recognized, but kept in reserve as a check against any discreditable appointment, the Liverymen being content that In practice the Aldermen should rise to the Mayoralty by a qualification the simplest and least invidious of any-seniority. It is a qualification, moreover, that is likely in this particular case to be quite as effective as any other. So long as our Lords AMayor are elected annually froma a privileged few, and without prospect of re-election, they will, as a class, be not less efficient rising to their office by seniority than if they were individually chosen for their merits, or favoured by lot, or selected on any other principle. This being understood, it is quite natural that the 10,000 liverymen, each entitled to vote, and each probably much better employed than in losing his time and wasting his energies amid the pushing, packing, and shouting of a " Common Hall," as the aMembly at which the election takes place is called, should abstain from these assemblies altogether, satisfied with the knowledge that whether they are present or absent the Mayor wiU be elected by rotation, and that they can predict with tolerable accuracy the names of the Lords Mayor for the next half-dozen years. But out of a dead cereraony springs a living abuse, and out of the formalities of a Common Hall there have arisen the corruption and bribery of a genuine election. Strange viwlity of evil-the mischief remains while we forego the good! It is said that a person named THoats Ros, possessing, or affecting to possess, relations with the lowest class of Liverymen, caUled 'long-shore men from their avocations on the river side, is in the habit of exacting a kind of blackmail from every candidate for civic dignities, by threatening that if he is not paid he will pack the HaU with his organized claque, and prevent the election of the candidate. The force of this threat lies in the fact that so much opposition may be raised as to render it necessary for the expectant Lord Mayor to demanda poll. Now, a poll is very expensive, and therefore, in spite of the scandal, everyLord Mayor hitherto has paid the extorted blackmail, rather than risk the cost and undergo the trouble of such a process. The first man to resist is Sir R. W. C,RDEN, the member of Parliament for Glocester, who is the highest on the list of Aldernen, and who would in regular order succeed to the Mayoralty without a whisper of opposition, if he would only make the customary payment. It is interesting to observe by what cantious steps he was approached, and how gradually he was placed under the action of the screw. At first it wa* stated, not directly to the Alderman, but " to "a person through whom it was known it would " find its way to Sir R. CARDEN," that 4,0001. had been subscribed in order to oppose his election. It was determined that the earliest intimation of resistance shoul; loom large in the distance, and should at once strike terror into the soul of the unsuspecting candidate. The approaches having thus been prepared, another statement, more precise than the former, is put forth, from which it appears that the sum actually subscribed is only 1,5001., that no less a sum can prevent opposition-indeed, to be at once accurate and moderate, 1,6001. can alone do it. The worthy Alderman is now supposed to be congratulating himself that he bas not to meet an expenditure of 4,00X1., and that he is only required to disburse 1001. more than his opponents bave already subscribed. To damp his satisfaction, speedily comes further information, conveyed in the same circuitons mode, that opposition is increasing, and that 2,0001. has been raised to defeat his election. Still he is not to be terrified, and Mr. TnoAs RosE suddenly lowers his demand to 1501., wvith the hope that in the joy of having escaped from a loss of thousands of pounds the candidate for the civic chair will be only too ready to part with so paltry a sum. " If I am to " come in as Lord Mayor for the ensuing year, I will come in upon principle, or I will not come in at "all. I will not give a fraction," said Sir R. CARDEN, much to his honour, but by no means to the discomfiture of Mr. TnomAs ROSE, -who immediately proceeded to work- his screw. The dialogue between this civic King maker and the Alderman's deputy is too rich not to be quoted ; it shows how highly civilization can polish those extractors of blackmail whom we are apt to regard as a rough, hard-hearted sort of men. " I have just discovered that this is about " to be printed," said RosE, presentiDg a MS. to the Alderman's deputy, Mr. KEBBEr, who asked him how he obtained it. " Wby," replied that benevolent man, " it was in the hands of my printer; "it was put into my hands to read, and, having "done so, I put it into my pocket. I offended the "printer excessively by doing so, but I would not "give it him back, and I brought it to you." The paper, after all, was a very harmless affair; intended to be damaging, it was only abusive, and few men of sense could fail to perceive its worthlessness. Its principal object, however, was to frighten Sir R. CARD&EN With the semblance of opposition, the gist of Mr. RoSE's conversation being announced in the threat that if the 1501. which had been demanded were not forthcoming, the paper would be published that night. The money was not paid, and the paper was accordingly printed as a large plicitrd and posted all over the City. It became necessary for Sir R. CARDEN to take steps to defeat these plans, and accordingly his solicitor appeared at the Mansion-house on Saturday to apply for a summons against THo0MAs RosE. The summons was at once granted, and probably the individual efforts of Mr. Ross are effectually paralyzed. It is more difficult, however, to deal with his retainers, who even with the loss of their head may, if not properly checked, be able to carry out his designs. It thereforo remains for the great body of Liverymen to determine whether they will allow themselves to be thus put up to market and chaffered over, or will slupport the senior Alderman in the maintenance of their rights and in resistance to extortionate demands. We are sure that the facts need only to be known, and that it is quite unnec&ssary for us to urge the electors, at whatever inconvenience, to attend the Common HaU to-morrow for the purpose of summarily defeating the laqTe. If our Lords Mayor are really to be elected, let the elections be genuine, and let all parties be forewarned; but if we have made up our minds that practically the appointment shall be determined by rotation, then let us not dispense with the rule for the sake of a sham election to gratify the cupidity and consolidato the power of a gang of petty tyrants.

AMERICA. (FROx OuV OWN 0OBlRNONDl. (BY ICExzIc AND? iTzATiox&L TzG1Li.) LnsPooL,, Srsr. 27. The British and North American Royal Mail steamship Asia, Lott oommander, has arrived from New York with advices to the 16th inst., and $55,000 specie on freight. hn, On the 19th the Asia passed a ateamer; on the 22d she pased the Ecrew stearmship Jura, and on the 25th the brig A. V. Minton, all bound west. The United States' mail steamship Baltic, and the Royal Mail steamship Persia, hence, had arrived at New York. The American convention assembled at Syracuse had organized harmoniously with Henry A. Northrup for permanent president. A spirited debate took place as to the propriety of constructing a new " platform," and it was linally decided to confine the resolutions to matters of State policy. The nominations were as follows :-For Secretary of State James 0. Putnem, of Erie; Controller, Colonel i. S. Benton, of Herkimer; State Treasurer, Layman Odel, of Livingston; Attorney-General, Henry B. Ross, of Essex. The Washington correspondent of the n ent York Herald says: "¢The Secretary of the Navy has had under consideratiorn the propriety of tendering the EDnglish Government the nse of the frate Niagara, to aid in ing down the telegraphio tabe to ndia, should the India Company purchase that portion of tho Atlantic cable nowr coiled on. the decks of the The Secretary of the Treasury, on appeal had reversed the decision of the collector of New ?york, who asserted a duty of 24 instead of 19 per cent. on coloured or plaid flannels. The Seeretary, on appeal, had also reversed the decision of the same collector, wzho imposed 24 instead of 19 per cent. on checked flanntels. In another case the Secretary says "In estimating the foreign charaters of wool with reference to its exemption from liability to duty, the appraisers can determine such vAlae, independently of the voice, by prices current and other reliable means of information of the value of the article in foreign markets, such as they employ in ascertaining the foreign value of other staple articles of import." A circular was about to be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury prohibiting the refunding of duties under the second of the Act, 1846, unless a protest be filed with the collector at the time when the duties were illegally exacted. The New Yor1k 7Tribune reports from Boston that George S. Abraham, a Custom-house broker and special agent for Baring Brothers, had been arrested there charged with forging invoices, thereby defrauding the United States' revenue. A tremendous gale had occurred along the southern coast. The Mobile Regier states that $150,000 had been raised in Georgia to enable Walker to make a new descent on Nicaragua. Newspapers from Salt Lake City report a public speech of Brigham Young, in which he uttered the following threats : " Now, let me tell you one thing; I shall take it s a witness that God designs to cut the thread between ns and the world when an armry undertakes to make their appearanoe in this territory to chastise mne or to destroy my life from the earth. I lay it down that right is-or at least should be-might with Heaven, with its servants and with all its people on the earth. As for the rest, we will wait a little while to see, but I shall take a hostile movement by our enemies as an evidence that it is time for the tbread to be cut. I think that we will find 300 ho will lap water, and we can wipe out lMidianites. Bentier Brother Beber said that,be could turn out his women, and tbey would whip them. I asLkno odds of the wicked, the best way they can fix it." California dates are to the 20th ult. San Fransisco markets were active. The Settlers' Convention had nominated the Hon. Eldward Stanley (the Republican candidate) for Governor, and a mixed ticket. In Washington territory Stevens (Democrat) had been elected to Congress by a large majority. Advices from St. Domingo state that the Beaz party, being hard pressed, had formed an alliance with the Emperor Soulouque, who had despatched assistance to his ally. At Havannah, on the 9th, the yeUow fever was increasing. The crisis in the New York money-market was believed to have been passed, and the symptoms of convalescence encouraged the hope of an early advent of better times. Previous to the departure of the steamer less difficulty had been experienced in obtaining accommodation at the discount houses on good paper, while the banks were disposed to grant as liboa facilities as po-sible without hazardiDg the impregnability of their position.The current rates for money were 15 to 20 per cent., for prime commercial paper, with very little at the inside figure, and 24 to 30 per cent. for second class rates. Most of the recent failures were believed to have been caused by an inability to realize upon securities, Bubject to the daily fluctuation of the stock-market. The Bank statement for the week was considered favourable, specie having increased from $10,227,965 to 12,181,857. From the New York papers we extract the following list of failures and rumoured failures:C. B. Stone and Co., of Boston; Conant, Dodae, and Co., of New York; Williamn H. BeU and Co.; Phllip Allen Torrm and Mr. Z. Allen, both of Providence; the HIaguenot Bank of New Paltz; . Piere and Eouise of WVashingaton. On the ]5th there was a run on the banks at WVashington. All stained themselves except the Georgetown Bank of Commerce, which refused to pay depositors; Namith and Co., of New York; Sword, Watling, and "o., of Philadelphia; the Citizen Bank; Collet (Collord) and Mugbes, of Cincinnati; Davis, Suydam, Dubois, and Co., of Row-doubt; Car. penter and Co., of New York; Ward and Nash, of Louisville. A despatch from Providence says:- ' The difficulty in the Bank of County is only tempo. raryg; there can be no doubt of its abundant ability to nmiet its engagements.' A despatch, dated New Orleans, Sept. 11, says,- *- The paper of a commission house in this city, chiefly engaged in the cotton and sugar rade, went to protest yesterday and to.day. The house has been established for several years, and has oonnexions in other parts of the South saNd in Europe. "The circulatlng notes of the Bank of Neaw Jersey at Nlew Brunswick, and of the Bank of New Orleans in this State, have been thrown out by the oMetrpolitan and American Exchange Banks." Exchange on London continued very regular, but the closing rates were 107 to 108k, being a decline of l per oent. on the week; I5rance, 618j 25; Bremen, 'I to 78t ; and Hamburg, 351 to 36. The total exports to Great Britain were 1,428,87 0 bales, being a decrease of 492,516 bales the previous year. The exports to all places were 2,252,657 bales against 2,954,606 last year. The consumption in the United States for the past seaon exceeded that of any previous year, being 840,000 bales to August 3L The quantity of new cotton received u to September 1 was only 100 bales, being a Eew amount than to the same time for the previous 12 yeams The stock on hand in all the ports of the United Statea was only 49,250 bales. In rega,rdto prices we find that there has been a gradual advanoe through. out the year, ranging from I1lic. for middling up. lands at the close of the preceding year, to 6lkc. for middling Orleans.

SECOLND EDITION# THB TIMBS orFF1C1, Monday Moning. THE IMPERIATL MEETING AT STUT'T1GART. (FB03t OUR SPEUIAL CORBESPONDRNT.) STUTTGART, SBPT. 25. The Emperor Louis Napoleon arrived here this afternoon at a quarter to 5, after having kept all Stuttgart on the tenter-hooks and tip-toes of expectation for a full hour and a half. The French Minister here, as well as f'ount de Montessuny, the French Minister at Frankfort, together with several of the Wurtemherg Ministers of State and Adjutants of the King, went out this morning by railway to meet the Emperor at the frontier station of Blrt;uhsal. Daring the forenoon, while all the world was talking and thinking exclusively of the French Emrperor, the Russisn Czar wvs driving about the town to pay visits to his relations in a simple barouch and a pair of horses, with his brother-in-law, the Prince Alexander of Hesse, seated at his right hand, and by this contrivance he passed everywhere unrecognised by the people, which is the more feasible, as at a little distance his round fur cap can hardly be distinguished from the bearskin caps of the Wurtembergfeidjeigers. The Emperor of Russia was received yesterday as one of the family at an insignificant railway station outside of the town without any guard of honour orfuss of any sort being made with him, the King's private carriage even bring used on the occasion; but the Emperor Louis Napoleon has been received to-day at the terminus here in the town with aU possible state and ceremony. Not only was the main station kept strictly reserved for the members of the Court, but also the street leading from the station to the Palace was lined with infantry and Lancers; this latter regiment very singularly, however, displayed at its head an Imperial eagle with the N, being a standard it took from troops under the command of the uncle in 1814, and was now paraded so judiciously before the eyes of the nephew in 1857. An eye-witness of the interesting ceremony that took place at the terminus enables me to inform your readers and future historians of the important fact, that the Emperor Louis Napoleon,on alightinig ft om the railway carriage, twice embraced the King *f Wurtemberg, who has waiting to receive him. This, doubtless, formed part of the French programme of the ceremonies, but it certainly would not have been introduced of his own accord by the King, who is an extremely cold, reserved, undemonstrative person. On this occasion all the members of the Royal family were present en grande tenue, with state carriage and servants in gold liveries, but, unfortunately, as the carriages were nob open, probably on account of the scorching heat and the dust, the carriages and the servants were all that the patient public got to see after two bour' waiting. The troops had hardly drawn off, after the cortege of carriages conveying the Emperor and his suite to the Palace had passed by, when a feldjager rode rapidly through the garden by the side of the Palace,and had hardly time to clear a space through the crowd when the Emperor of Russia drove up in a carriage and pair with his brotherin-law, the Prince of Hesse, and followed by a *ingle adjutant. My letter of yesterday has told you that the two Emperors would dine to-day with their respective hosts separately, and meet for the first time this evening at the entertainment givea by the Crown Prince, and it may be that this is true still; but if it be otherwise, and the Emperor of Russia has come to dine with the King and his Imperial guest, I shonld be disposed to believe, from the excellence of my authority for the former version, that His Russian Majesty has unexpectedly deviated from the arrangements that well-informed members of - the Court believed yesterday to be still valid. It is possible also that the visit is only one of formal greeting and a mark of attention to the French Emperor; on the other hand a much more surprising deviation from the intended programme, which I have been enabled already to announce to you by telegraph, consists in the approaching arrival of the Empress of Russia, which is now expected to take place to-morrow. It is also a novelty in the arrangements, that it should have been decided at length that the Prince of Prussia shaU come hither to greet the Emperor Louis Napoleon in the name of the King, his brother, for it had hitherto been understood that he would pay his respects to the French Emperor in his character of Military Governor of the Rhenish Provinces only, when the latter should touch upon Prussian territory on his return homewards. The reasons that were hitherto supposed to have deterred the Empress of Russia from accompanying the Emperor hither, were stated generally to be questions of etiquette, a phrase which says nothing of itself, and leaves everything to be guessed; at any rate, they were certainly not political, and, with reference to her husband's wishes and interests, not very politic. She was assumed to have taken it very much amiss that the Emperor Louis Napoleon should have decided to fix the meeting to take place at Stuttgart, rather than at the Court of her brother, the Grand Duke of Hesse, with whom she has been staying hitherto. She was also supposed to object to meeting two persons who make so little scruple of admitting that they are parvenus, as the Emperor and Empress of the French do. Those still closer initiated in the intimate gossip of the Grand-Ducal Court of Hessen ascribed her unwillingness to accompany the Emperor to other causes. Whichever, if any of them, may have been the correct reason, her scruples have at length been overcome, and she is to arrive to-morrow. The Queen of the Netherlands (daughter of the King of Wartemberg by his first wife) with her son, Prince Alexander, Prince Augustus of Wurtemberg, who has just received the command of the Third Prussian Army Corps, and the Grand-Duchess Helena, the sister of Prince Frederick of Wurtemberg, have arrived here, on a visit to this Court, together with many smaller personages. Prince Gortschakoff, who accompanied the Emperor hither yesterday, has had apartments assigned him in the King's old Palace. Couut Nesseirode and Count Kisseleff have been obliged to put up with ordinary hotel accommodation, for the Crown Prince's villa at Berg, where the Emperor is staying, is much too small to house any more than those who belong to the immediate family circle. In consequence of the Empress's approacihing arrival, as it is understood, the ball that was to have been given to-night by the Minister of Foreign Afaars in honourof the distinguished diplomates now here, Gortschakoff, Neseirode, Kiseleff, and Walewski, has been put off till to-morrow. At 8 o'clock this evening the King and his Imperial guest drove out to the soiree given by the Crown Prince in his villa at Berg, which was bril liantly illuminated on the outside in a manner well fitted to show off to advantage the architectural beauties of the building. The road winding up to it in a serpentine line around the =ountain on which it is situate,was lighted by a rw of Chinese lanterns along each side, and all along the tortuous windinga of the road leading through the royal park toward. the Crown Princs villa ther'a woe cable-like toches plaa at intervals, and flariDgau uncertain luid light ftom. hig& iron rermeta es the foliage, df the Imea.ndthe &,mups that a them. In the royal park it was pleasing enough to see the briliant equipages dashing along through the constantly alternating darkness and light, and then to dibtinguish their lamps winding up the mountain at Berg between the double row of manycoloured lamps; but the whole iUumination of the Crown Prince's viUa was outshone and eclipsed by a sheet of lights that was spread down one side of the mountain, where a garden for public resort and amusement has lately been opened in connexion with a. very extensive bathing establishment supplied by a most plentiful mineral spring. Here not only did the buildings of the establishment form an extensive frame-work for the lights, but every terrace cut along the face of the declivity, and every path laid out over the aide of the mountain, was marked by rows of lights; every grass plat was studded with artificial glowworms, and the clusters of trees were turned to ac. count as supports for festoons of lamps and Chinese lanterns. With the addition of Bengal lights, Roman candles, and rockets let off occasionally to light up for an instant the surrounding masses of mountains looming in the distance, the scene was highly effective at a distance, but a nearer inspection brought to view thousands of forms flitting about the gardens that were neither forms of light norbeauty,butvery plain homelyWurtembergers, and moreover introdaced the olfactories to a mixed odour fromthe fatburning inthemyriads of lamps,Wurtembergtobacco, and wretched beer, thatwas farfrom perfume. This fearful consumption of tallow and fat in combustion was gotup regardless of expense by the proprietor, who is the Crown Prince's head gardener, in honour of the meeting of so many crowned heads at the elegant vila that overlooks the establishment, and accordingly the front of the building, bore in brilliant transparency the initials W.A.N.K -King William of Wurtemberg, Emperors Alexander and Napoleon, and Crown Prince Karl. Yesterday evening the King and Queen of Wur. temberg, with the Queen of the Netherlands, occupied a proscenium box at the performance of the French company now here; the Emperor Alexander was present in the opposite box with the Crown Prince and Princess. Here again the Emperor Alexander figured only as a private guest related to the Royal family; the State loge in the middle of the first tier was not used, but will next Sunday contain the whole party from both palaces, on which occasion Balfe's opera of the Bohemian Girl is to be played as a gala performance under KiEcken's direction. After the play was over yesterday evening the Emperor of Russia drove for some time about the town in an open carriage.
EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris corre spondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- Of the countless comments and conjectures provoked at this moment by the movements and Interviews of great personages, it is agreeable to observe that the great mass and general tendency are favoarable to peace and good understanding among the Governments of Europe. There is a growing belief that the question of the Danubian Principalities is likely to be arranged satisfactorily. Tho foun. dation of such an arrangement was laid, it is thought, at Osborne, and the matter will probably make progress at Stuttgart and Weimar. It may even be subject of conversation elsewhere between two Sovereigns, the report of whose approaching meeting is again revived. Le vent est aux entrevues. The news of the meeting of the Russian and Austrian Emperors, so unexpectedly annoumced, may have disposed the world to give ready credence to other interviews of the kind, but it is certain that there is a disposition to believe that one may probably occur between Napoleon and Francis Joseph. Concurrently with this general shaking of hands among Emperors, certain movements of minor personages are not without significance. From Rome we hear that General de Goyon, who con,mands the French army of occupation, was about to leave for Naples, charged, as it was understood, with a special mission from the Emperor; and at the same moment] we learn the arrival in Paris of the Prince Villafranca, an important personage at the Court of the Two Sicilies. People ask if the long disagreement with Naples is about at last to be terminated. A report current to-day that a change for the better is on the eve of taking place in the relations between England and France on the one hand, and Greece upon the other, has probably sprung from the visit of the Queen of Greece to Stuttgart. Thisvery active lady vas the last person to miss an opportunity of the kind that has presented itself. She was about to go to Munich when thenews of the meeting of the Emperors induced her temporarily to change herroute, and visit Darmstadt, thence to proceed to Stuttgart under the wing of the Empress of Russia. Doubtless she has hopes of furthering her darling object-her brother's succession to the crown of Greece. The news of the Ermpress Marie Alexandrowna's arrival at Stuttgart has caused surprise, and, it is presumed, will hereafter be explained. Such explanation may seem the more necessary because certain delicate negotiations known to have taken place remained without result. It was thought possible for a moment that the two Sovereigns who were to meet at Stuttgart would have been accompanied by their wives; and a strong conviction is felt here that the presence of those illustrious ladies would have increased the cordial character of the interview. The true reason why the projected arrangement came to nothing has never been publicly stated, although it is thoug,ht to be well understood. There was no apparent difficulty in the way. The Empress of Russia was at Darmstadt, and the Empress of the French was then expected at the camp of Chalons. The idea of this visit hasbeen, it isgenerally supposed, abandoned; for, although the Empress Eug6nie is expected at St. Cloud to-morrow, it is thought unlikely she will go to the camp-now that the weather is less settled, and that the Emperor himself will return there, it is said, but for a very short visit, just to take leave of the troops. The Empresa of Russia, we were lately informed, was unwell, and locomotion was strictly forbidden by her medical advisers. Suddenly we learn her appearance at Darmstadt, which may doubtless be taken as an indication of improved health. The merest trifles often suffice to break down a well-concerted plan, and to such we are perhaps to attribute the nono0currence of the meeting of the Empresses, a meeting whieL is believed to have been much desired in a high quarter. The raising of the camp of Chalons is still fixed for the 5th proximo. It is said that the whole of the Guard will enter Paris together. In the Empeor's absence the manceuvres continue, com. manded by General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely ; but visitors are comparatively few, and the camp has lost much of ite interest and ani. mation. The pectateur, referring to a cotTespondence from Paris, rays that, with very few exceptions, the French papers have ceen with grief the explosion in British India. This asertion would not call for particular notice, were it not made In reply to an imagined affirmation or insinuation of the contrary contained in tho correspondence inx question, the exact drift of which the Specttaur does not seem to have seized. It has baen repeatedly reeognized with pleasure that with few and unimportant exceptions, the Parin journals have employed a meat friendly and sympa. ithizinglanguag, and tona wben speaking of recent calamitieg in Ind.a, antl the $pdateur is perfectly Icorect when it sars, iais he Si&lce is not one 9y those scanty exceptions, although, in the pursuit of one of its favourite objeeb, it may have seemed, -for a moment, to look upon England's difficulties in 'the East as a circumstance that might be profited by for its attainment. It is, however, no easy matter exactly and positively to interpret the meaning of an article so very guarded and obscure as the one in the ai&de, which gave rise to the observations the Specta ieur now combats. As regards the additional observations of the latter paper, a few words may be permitted. That the French press has not shared the con'fidence at first expressed by some English journals of the prompt suppression of the insurrection, only proves that, as a spectator comparatively uninterested in the struggle, it has taken v: less manguine and, as events up to the present time would seem to prove, a juster view of th6 question. As to its not having echoed the cries of vengeance that have resounded in England, that is another matter, and on this head rather too much philanthropy has been expended on this side of the Channel. It is easy for lookers-on to be merciful - although, in presence of the horrors recounted in recent letters from India, some of the Paris papers have coped their remonstrances, and adtnitted that it could not be wondered at if they elicited a shout of fury and revenge. Let the French remember that, worse even than the atrocities they read in print are tho details that reach England, and that are not printed, because they are too shocking. Let them put themselves for a moment in our place, and imagine the scene to be Algeria instead of Hindostan, and every post to be bringing them the sickening narrative of the deeds of darkness perpetrated by savages upon their nearest and dearest, of the tortures and outrages unspeakable to which their women and children are subjected. I do not think there would then be great talk of mercy in France, or that it would be thought too much to demand the extermination of the inhuman monsters who have shown so little to their defenceless victims. In war, as in other circumstances, the French have repeatedly proved themselves a generous and humane people, but certainly the English have nothing to learn from them in these respects. In fact, however, it matters little what difference of opipion may exist between Paris and London as to the way in which the Indian mutineers and murderers should be treated. It is " a far cry' to the Ganges, and there can be no doubt that the minds of our Generals and soldiers are pretty well made up as to the treatment proper for all they may find in arms against them, or can prove to have taken part in the cruelties of tne last five months. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- " MARSEILLES, SEPT. 26. "The Indian mail is not yet signalled. "From Genoa, under date of the 25th, we learn the following:- "'The Piedmontese Gastte of the 23d int. denies that any engagement had been taken by the Government to expe Neapolitan refugees. To-day the Genoa papers say that a number has been expelled the city. " ' At Florence the journal the Lys has been suspended for a month for its attacks on Piedmont. " From Rome, under date of the 23d, we learn that Mgr. Fransonil returns to Lyons, and that the negotiations 'with Piedmnont are adjourned." "BERNE, . 26. " The Grand Council of Vand has decreed that, tntil the solution of the confict, the Government of the canton wil abstain from all material opposition, to the orders of the Swiss Federal CounciL" " XADRID, SmPT. 26. "The Queen has inaugurated the Agricultural Exposltion." To-nights papers are full of details of the Stuttgart interview. The special correspondent of the Paysthus relates the firstgreeting of theEmperors-._ " The Emperor Napoleon entered the Palce with the King of Wurtemberg; the Emperor Alexander, coming out of the grand saloon with the Princess Helena, met him, and the two Emperors shook hands with great warmthThey both showed much emotion. The two Sovereigns im mediately afterwards entered the Queen's apartments, where no one was admitted, except the members of the Royal family, until after a conference, which lasted a considerable time." The Courrier de la Gironde publishes a letter addressed by 17 commercial houses at Bordeaux to the Chamber of Commerce of that city, requesting its intervention with the Imperial Government to obtain better protection for the French settlements in the East Indies than the authors of the letter believe to exist at present. They are moved to this application, they say, by the deplorable situation of the Presidency of Bengal at the date of the last advices, and by apprehensions that the insurrection may extend over the whole AngloIndian territory. They refer to the treaties of 1814 and 1815, by which Chandernagore, Pondicherry, Karikal, and Mah6, placed under the immediate protection of England, are forbidden to raise fortifications or to draw troops from the mother country for their protection. This stipulation does exist in the treaty of the 30th of M ay, 1814, and the number of soldiers allowed for the police of those settlements is extremely limited. But it was evident that, under such unforeseen and peculiar circumstances as the present, it would not be difficult for friendly Governments to come to an understanding on this point, and accordingly we have already learned the arrival of half a battalion of French Marines in India, while an equal number is either on its way out or about to sail. Prince Napoleon is actually partant pour la Syrie. He has obtained permission to travel in the East, and we may suppose will take the opportunity of making his promised examination of the Isthmus of Suez. It is reported, but appears rather improbable, that, before returning to Spain, the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier propose visiting Constantinople. General Yankouski, aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Russia, has arrived in Paris, on some military mission. According to the latest intelligence from New Caledonia, the Governor of the French settlemeats had issued a proclamation in the native language, announcing that, the island being now a French possession, cannibalism would not be tolerated, but would be punished as murder. AUSTRIA. (FmoM OUR OWVN COaRESONnENT.) VIENNA, Sr.rr. 24. The whole city talks of the approaching retire ment of Count Buol from otfice, but persons who are usuaUy well acquainted with what is passing in the highest circles state that the only foundation for the prevalent report is the m health of the hMinister, who leaves on Monday next for Carlsbad, where he will remain three weeks or a month. For some time past Count Buol has looked sadly care-worn, and it is very. probable that he is as little satisfied with the position which Austria now occupies in Europe as is the public. A day or two since the Representatives of Austria at the Bri*Al and. French Courts ame here, and thedr arrival has led to a rumour that' one or the othr of them will be the suceesser of Cotmt BuoL I do not think that either Cenm Appony nor Baron HRfiner will ever be at theQhead of the Foreign DepaInent, for the one is a Hlungarian, and the other a *lan of low origin% and would inevitably be " stubbed" by the high-born diplomatisbt who are assembled at this Court. In official circles,-for evetthereitisthecJuestionof the retirementof Count Bui I-the name, of Counts Rechberg, Mensdorff, Poi4Rly, and '(olloredo, are mentioned; but the nob iemau rt mentioned, who Is now President of the term Confederation, is reputed to be the uo4 t ble man of the three. Counts Mensdorff and CoI t.do are, however, more popular than Count Rr, hbeg, rwho is reported to be of an irritab)e tenter. ihe oomplaint under which the Austrian mrjneyrmA.%t is Ubouriv%Wz , -"ill htbd news That the Emperors of Russia and Austiij are to meet will produce a favourable, even if temporary, effect on the patient. The excuse for the enormous expenditure of the War Department has hitherto been " the unsatisfactory state of the relations between Austria and Russia;" but when the two Monrchs are reconciled, and it is no longer necessary to keep such a large army on foot, the outlay of the " supreme commando of the army" may, perhaps be reduced from 123,000,OOfl. to 100,000,000f. or even to lees. During the last week zeveral Cabinet Councils have been held, and it has transpired that financial matters were discused at almost aU of them. Not long since Baron Bruck proposed measures for the improvement of the paper currency, and for the effectual relief of the over-burdened moneymarket, but they are said not to have met with the approbation of the Council of the Emnpire (eich.srat4). A few days since, however, the Mmnister of Finance was at Laxenburg, and it vas observed that he returned, after having had an audience of tho Emperor, in better spirits than usual Tt is believed that the propositions of the Minister were accepted by His Majesty, and that the new financial measure will be made known to the public either in October or in November. Naturally all matters of finance are kept as secret as possible, but every now and then they transpire, and no one knows how. Thus information has reached me that provincial banks are to be established, which will have the privilege of emitting notes to a certain amount. The nominal value of the notes issued by the various provincial banks will probably be some 40,000,000 or 50,000,000 florins, and the National Bank will make a reduction to the same amount in ite paper circulation. The measure is naturally intended to facilitate the resumption of cash payments on the part of the Bank. In order that no new scrip may be brought into the market, which in already so overgorged with indusfriel stock, the following measures will, as is said, be taken :-Government will complete the GaUician Railroad from Cracow to IRszeszow, and then permit the GaUician Railroad Company to purchase it should it feel inclined so to do. The shareholders of the GaUician Railroad Company are not likely to have any demand made on them until the line from Dembica to Rszeszow, is completed. Government will build the branch railroad from Linz to Passau for the Western Railroad Company, as the Munich Cabinet has declared its resolve not to begin the works on the main line between Rosenheim and Salzburg unless Austria at once commences operations on the-above-mentioned branch line, which is of importance to Bavaria. The Theiss Railroad Company will not-for the present, at least-be called on to begin that part of the line which is to rnn from Miskolez to the Galician frontier. The Austro-French Company will only have to construct such parts of the Eastern or Semlin Railroad as do not run paraUel with the Theiss or any other railway. The construction of the Carinthian R;ilroad is, with the exeeption of a very small part of it, to be postponed sine die, and the Pilsen-PragueHof (Bohemian North-Western) Railroad wiU not be commenced until the times have improved . von IZwenthal, the councilor of a section in the Ministry of Commerce, has just returned from Paris, where he succeeded in establishing the conditions of a postal-convention between France and Austria. The two Governments being desirous to further the interests of their subjects, have agreed to reduce the postage of a single letter from Paris to Vienna from 29 kreutzers (1lid. English) to 15 or 16 kreutzers. The Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna continues to urge the monastic orders to return to the rules and regulations made by their respective founders, but they offer a passive resistance to his Eminence. The Benedictines, who possess vast establishments inthis city, and at Klcsterneuburg, Gottweih, Mlk, St. Florian, and Kremsmunster, decline to make any change in their mode of life, and public opinion is with them, as they have, for a long series of years, rendered excellent service to the State by dedicating their whole attention to the education of its subjects. Reliable information has reached me that the Concordat is almost a dead letter in Hungary, as the bishops are far less bigoted than their Austrian and Italian colleagues, and the lower clergy are extremely hostie to the Ubltramontane party. Even the Archbishop of Agram, who is a very faithful adherent to the Papal See, cannot venture strictly to enforce the conditions of the Concordat in Croatia, a province in which a very large proportion of the people belongs to the Greek Church. The Archbishops of z :an, Erlau, and Kalocza are somewhat in disgrace here, because they signed the petition which the Hungarian magnates were so desirous to present to the Emperor. A well-informed acquaintance, who resides in Hungary, tells me that Government will have extreme difficulty in raising the taxes this next year. While the war was going on in the Crimea, and the ports of Russia were closed against England and France, the Hungarians obtained very high prices for their corn, and could pay their taxes, but now that they are unable to obtain more than Sfl. 20 (1,0s. 8d. English) for a kilbel* of fine wheat, they will be totaUy unable to do so. In 1851, and 1855, and 1856, the kilbel of wheat rarely cost less at Pesth than lGfl. (11. 12s.) There is much distress in some parts of Hungary, and it will not excite surprise that such is the case, if it is considered that the taxes are very heavy, and that Kossuth notes to the amount of 67,000,000 of florins, were eight or nine years ago declared to be mere waste paper. I am sorry to say that the officer who committed such a brutal assault on the Mayor of HiItteldorf is still at liberty, and exhibiting himself at Pahrendorf. Smrr. 25. Although the Vienna public is by no means distinguished for political acumen, it evidently has an instinctive feeling that the policy of Austria is about to undergo a change. Yesterday the inhabitants of this city were in total ignorance of the arrangements that had been made for the meeting of the Emperors of Austria and Russia at Weimar, but stiU it was generally rumoured that some change was about to be mado in the Cabinet. In the evening the rumour had assumed a more definite form, and it war, related that the Minister for Foreign Aiffairs had tendered Ihis resignation. I have reason to believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not expressed to his Sovereign a wish to retire from his post. It is possible that Count Buol may remain in office for a time in order to sav, appearances, but his position will be untena"e should the meeting between the Emperors of AustrI& and Russia lead to a sincere reccmdilation. Prince Gortachakoff has continually beei wort ia his political tilts with Count Buok and hewM hardly fail to represent to his Szw4reigu that Austria cannot be trusted as long a& the author of the Triple Alliance (England, Franceh Austr;&) is at the head of the Foreign Departssnt. The fact that Count Buol does not accompay the Emperor to Weimar is coxisidered extreme)y significant, and many persons believe that *when Be returns from Calsbad to Vienna he 'wll nro longer be a member of the Cabinet. HiT. Majea, wh'o will be at Weimar on the 1st of O)ctober, will tavel by rail from that city to DrerJdeu,and probably in the company of the EmPt.ror Alexander. It is certain that the King of Prusia will not go to the Stuttgart, but it is not known whether he will meet the two Emperors at Weimar. On the 4th of Otobetr the Emperor and * The RiAWbe contains two Austrian1 Metzeo (5 140 lb. ERnglish.) E;p;esa of Rusi will cros the froptier intoPoljand. The oth will be passed at an estate belonging to the family of the late Marshal Paskievitcbj -and on the Gth their Majesties will make their solemn entry into Warsaw. Three day wrill bs spent in that city in eating, drinking, dancing, aUd merry-making; and on the 9th their M!ajesties will leave for Kieff, where there are to be very imposing religious coeremonies. The distance from Warsaw to Kieff is about 600 English miles, but the journoy dwil probably be performed in 80 or 90 hour,, as their Majesties intend to travel, by night as well. as by day. The Czar made a vow to go to the city of Kieff after the death of the late Emperor, and it was originally his intention to undertake the jour. ney directly after his coronation. ITALY. A letter from Trieste, of the 21st inst., informs us that the Prince de Joinvillo, on his arrival al Venice, had visited the Naval Arsenal. He embarked on board one of the Austrian Lloyd,s steamers Qo the 19th, and sailed for Constantinople. SPAIN. The Madrid papers of the 23d inst. state that several Republican proclamations had been seized there, together with a copy of instructions for thO new members who shall join the Republican secret societies. Some arrests had been made.

FRANCE. (F0OM OUR OWN CORRESPOR'DRNT.) PARIS, SrTURDAY, SEPT. 26. The trial of Carpentier, Grellet, Guerin, and Parod, for stealing 5,752 shares of the Northern Railway Company, was concluded at 7 o'clock last evening before the Court of Assize of the Seine. The jury remained in consultation for nearly two hours, when they returned a verdict of " Guilty" against Carpentier, Grellet, and Guerin, and acquitted Parod. They found extenuating circumstances in the case of Carpentier and Guerin. The Court sentenced Carpentier and Guerin each to imprisonment for five years, and Grellet to solitary confinement for eight years. Carpentier, Grellet, and Parod were further sentenced at the demand of the Northern Railway Companyjointly and severally to restore to the company 4,112 Northern Railway shares, and Guerin to restore 1,400 shures. The term of imprisonment for the debt was fixed by the Court at five years. Several female clubs have been formed in the departments of the Var and the Gironde for mutnal relief against celibacy. The original club, after which the others are modelled, has been in existence for four years. Each member pays lOf. monthly to the teasurer. These subscriptions produce annually 24,000f., to wbich is added the amount raised by two half-yearly lotteries, of which the prizes are composed of valuable articles, the gift of the members. The original club is composed of 200 young ladies. At the end of the year the society is enabled to dispose of 30,OOOf. or 40,000f., which serve to give a marriaoe portion to two or three of the members, chosen by ballot. If the fortunate caudidates are not married within a. year, the money retums to the common fund, and additional candidates are portioned the following year. The members of the club continue to pay theirsubscriptions for ten years after their marrnage, and are bound to facilitate by a.m reane in their power the marriage of their former: asaciates Tbe members of the assocition, marrd or , ae bound as long as they live to aid a 50000Wh fellow members under all circurnstaces, MI.

Lawne, Ca. formerly in comnnand of the Third Light nfantry Brpd. at Alderhott, who bs been appointed tmporarily to succed Colonel Dixon in command of the oamp at ColZoegter, entered upon his duties on Saturdaj. The departue of the 1it Depot Battalion has roduood the streogtl, of the gaTison to 76 officem and 1,748 nou-oommissione4 officers and men, no other depOt having arrivod during the pas week. Recrtui Ing is still carried on very energeticoaly, the number of recruits averagig abont 50 weekly, and the grtest acti vity prevails throughout tho camp in preparing men for the eversl regiments now oa service ia the Eaet Into iwblh they have enlisted. Draughts from tho various cavalrry regments stationed In Ireland have arrived in Dublin for the purpose of taking up the horses of the Sth Hussars and 17th Laneors, both of which fine corps prxeed tbis week by railway to Cork, there to embark for Lndia. On Thursday a special train brought 300 men oi the 18h Royal Irish from the Curragh of Kildaro to Cork. imme distely on their arrival at the quay they embarked on board the Royal AUce for Qucenstown, whence they will sa4 ia the scwew steamer Italian direct for India. The following are the names of the officers accompanying this portion of the regiment :-Major Burrows, Captain Annesley, Lieu. tenants Rlung, Burke, and Hotham; Ensigns Shaw and Lebrmn; and Assistant-Surgcon Porteouo. The remaider of the regiment is expected. Notwithstanding the numerous draughts which have proceeded from the Indian depOts at Chatham garrison for the purpose of joining tho service compauies of their respective regiments in the Bengr-, Madras, and Bombay Presidencies, the entire strength of the Provisional Battalion is still nearly 2,000 men of all ranks, which number will very shortly bo increased to 6.000, in consequence of the augmentation of the various depOts by the almost daily arrival of large bodies of recruits for the different Indhin regiments. On Saturday afternoon upwards of 100 fine reoruits arrived at Chatbam barracks, chiefly from the north of Ireland, Liver. pool, London, and some of the inland counties, and on the previous day an equaly large number joined the Provisional Battalion, having arrived chiefly from Devonshire, for the purpose of joining the depOts of the 8th, 52d Light Infantry, and 61st Regiments. A large quantity of clothing has been received into store at Chatham, from Weedon, in order that the troops may be properly clothed previously to their em. baroation. On Saturday afiernoon the whole of the troops attached to the Provisional Battalion at Chatham were aseambled on the inner lines, near Fort Amherst, in heavy marching order, for the purpose of being inspected by Colonel IL Jervls, the commandant. The troops exeouted their -varloae manoeuvres with great precision, and their appearance ws very saitisfactery to the Inspeoting field offlcer. At the termination of the Inspection the depOts were formed into square for the purpose of hearing read the sentence of a court-martial on a private of the 19th Regiment, who had been tried and found guilty of having abzentedhimself from his regimont at Aldershott at the time It was under orders to enbark for India. The prisoner was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment in Fort Clarence, after which he will be sent out to his regimeat in India. The following officers have arrived at Chatham for the purpose of joining the battalions nowly formed at thit garnison :-Captain W. F. A. Coleman, 53d Regiment; Lieutenant W. J. Anderson, 32d Reeiment ; and Lieutenant RlAnnesley Byre, 63d Regiment. Second-ClaStaffSurgeon H. Huish, M.D., has been appointed surgoon to the econd battalion, under the command of Coloael R.N. Phllips; and Quartermaster Golby, who lately serzed with the BritUsh Swiss Legion during the RussLan war, ha been appointed to the staff of the 3d battalion, under the oommand of Colonel C. Elmhirst. On Friday morning 40 men and an officer of each bat. taiOn of the Royal Artillery, Woolwich, with portions of the mounted corps and the whole of the recruits, were paraded in the riding-house establishment at 7 azm., under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel G. A. F. de Rinzy, 12th battalion, to witness the execution of oorporal punishment awarded to gunner and driver John Malley, of the 9th battalion, recently arrived at head quarters from Four. gie barracks, Alderney. The prisoner had been adjudged by a garison court-mart to undergo tbe punishment of 50 lashes, which was accordingly put into effect, and to be imprisoned in Fort Clarence 56 days, after -which he is to be required to retun to hia duty. The crime, which Was Witnessed by two gunners quartered in the room with the prisoner, was his having robbed a tallor of the company, also oecupying a berth in the ome room, of a 5Z, Bank of England note. On pereiving that the aot wa detectd the prisoner made An attempt to swallow the note. An augmentation of the non-commisdoned officrs of the Roy-a Artillery at Woolwlch took place on Saturdy, by a promotion of two of the most meritorious gnners in each of the 14 battalions, so S to enable the embodying an xdditional battalion, which will be oomposed of the recruits newly enrolled when suffiiently numerous, On Saturday a number of healthy, growing youths were receivedat head. quarters from Westminster, where the recruiting station has been increased, and although somewhat below tho re gistered standard, they were paed as admissble. In consequence of the length of time whioh has elapsed since the departur of the Royal Arllery comp-aies which sailed from Woolwlih on the 23rd of April for China, but which were subsequently ordered to India, the condition of the women and children is very distressing. The wives of the private soldiers, many of whom have families of young children, according to regula. tloas, are allowed 6d. per day by the East India Company. In addition to the above, the married men are supposed to have handed over about les. per month, prior to embarcatlon, for the benefit of their families. This is considered the maXi mum possible, taking into consideration the reduction of 3. for a s kit and6 d. a day for rations. As no notification of their Arrival has been received up to the present moment these poor creatures have only the bare 64. per day for the support of themselves And, in rnany cases, six chUdren, nd are, consequently, in a slate of starvation. Colonel Brown, Commandant of the Royal Marine Garrison of Woolwich, whose leave of abseuce has expird, returned from the continent on Friday, and resumed the duties of his post yesterday. Her Majesty's paddlewheni tranport Dee, Maser-Commander Thomas Pullen, sailed from Woolwich on Saturday for Devonport, having a ful cargo of boilers and steam machinery for the Melpomene and Aboukir, under construction at that and Pembroke yards.

"C CALIrSrz4 Lord CLONCURRY ,moved the first resolution, and said that he had great pleasure in doing so, because they were All aware of what aOmfort indivldutl sympathy was for in- ividal woe. nd on the same princIple what comfort might notthe sympathy of One nation bring to another nation lu woe? Tba people of this country were no advocates of Lynch law, but if it was ever excusable it would be in such a case as this-upon these men, who deservedtto be dra3gged from their dens, -tarred and fathered, and gtoned through the streets by the women of DuLblin. (ear.) His Lordship then rad the resolution .- Tht It is with mingled feelings of sorrow and 4innaUtlo Mht we hare herd of the unWe%liaie atroceie Which hasebest eceontly VrietratedbY the natives n Tndi upon oar felow-suble,o move erg.- caily upon the women and children; and that Wo hereby expresr our doeeWp st YmDth with thos, who re sti expoed to dafe and privalise abroad, and ao with thoe who we mouriug over their bezeamements athomoe. Catain WILLIAbMS seconded the resolution, and said that elid been directed by his Excellenoy to attend, for the parpose of presenting his donation of 100& ApEle His compassionate disposition was evinced for all who were in sorrow, but they could well imagino how much more extended il sympathy was for his felow-countrymen aud countrywomen in the East. They might attribute this sad visitation partly to the bungling of statesmen, partly to the rmsmanagement of the East India Company, and partly t) the interference and meddling of petty logislators and finuanl reformers, who reduced the strength of tseir army (hear, hear), inpaired its efficiency, and who had done th ir best to dem oralize it in discipline. From whatever cause these calamities iad arisen, our power must be restozed by force of arms. (Hear, hear.) The resolution was carried unanimouesy. The LoRD MAYOR observed that Colonel Henry White, of Woodlands, requested his name to be put down for 501. Lord Gough had contributed the munificent sum of 1004 (Cheers.) Lord Viscount GoutGH next presented himself, and was received with loud applause. le said,-My Lord Mayor and gentlemen, I rlse oppressed with strong feelings hang lost near and dear relatives-the truest friende I ever had-my firmest supporters during the whole of my career in India. Sir H. Lawrenoe-in short.: every name that has been mentioned-those whom I had known for years have paid a noble debt to their country. (Cheers.) They have fallen, and that country wili ever esteem their memory, abd hold it in remembrance. (Hear.) I entirely concur in the strong, but not too strong, observations of the noble Lord who proposed the first resolution, in deprecating and holding up those wretches who are advocating the cause of the nutineues. I know the conduct of the Company and of the officers towards the Sepoys, tnd I can declare to you, as an officer, as a gentleman, and as an Irishman, who would not glees over misconduct in any one, that the native soldiers fave nothing to complain of. (Loud cheers.) The feelings of the Board of Directors and universally of the Government of India, towards these soldier have been those of a parent to a child. (Hear.) I believe they have been led to think lightly of us hy our too great rdiness to ooncede to tbem in everything connected withtheircastes I willgive you an istan e of the horrors perpetrated by these wretches. By the last mail I received a letter from SirPatrickGrat, inwhich he referred to the loss of that noble fellow, Major Holmes. There never was a man, perhapsm who devoted himself to his regimnat with more assiduity than that officer. The nighit =efre his troops inutinied he wrote to the Commander-in-hie fin India, stating that the Government might depend upon his regiment of irregular cavalry, as they 'were prepared to fight for it. What was their conduct next morning? They massacred this man, who looked upon them as his children who contributed to their comforts out of his own pocket, and who never lost sight of their' iiterests. They massacred his wife and backed ber to piecesk eid they mirdered the doctor who constantly attended on them, and, to add to their infamy, they murdered his wife and oild also. ( Oh, oh I and sensation,) How couldffany man in his senses say that these men were justified in what they did? Believe me when I say the Indian soldier is not, j fledl in even complaining, mush less in coilimitting these horrid atroritiede thaet will make themforlever ahdespised and degraded race. (" Hear, hear," and cbeesfo Ti handing in his hum ble contribution he had not done more than his position in' society called upon him to do. The noble and gallnt Vscout concluded by proposing the fol lowdng resolution:- "ht, In o rder to meet the iveent neceiltlee of these wrho ha7e beeu lelt destytute by thee camotler a fund be raieo fo the ree of the letrerf; ra o the itizensof Dubla and oters l nteredei d in the uso re horeby to ited to at wth ther actomed llbenal at this presiang and inmreoedentes crieiss t n Mr. GbOeen A, Mdd ., secoteded the resolufion, rd.

(Eear) HIe had put together a few sug>gestions wrhich he wuld submit to the meeting. The first was that anaddress be presented to Eer Majest, praying that Her Mfajesty would be graciously pleasea to assume tbe style and title of Queen of (lreat Britain, Ireland, and 1ndfa. (Cries of "No, "Question.) The next was that legstive measures might be introduced into Parliament with that view ( No no'); that the present government by the East Inais Company might be abolishb; that with the style and title of Queen -ler Majesty might assume all the rights, power, perogitlves pre-eminence, and superiorities thereto belonging." (Cries of "lQuestion.") The LOBtD MAYon hoped that MIr. Grattan would see that the sense of the meeting wxa aginst his propodtion, and that he was wandering from the quetiorn before the meet- 5fr. GRATrAN said he would not press his suggestions further. He was happy to think that from Ind to end of the country the sympathies of the poople would be with the sufferers in India (hear), and he was convinced that Irzhmen would avenge the insult and wron s Infictedon women, whether in India or Ireland. (ear The learned gentleman concluded by handing in 201. as hs saubscription to the fund. The meeting was subsequently addressed by the Hon. George H andcock, Colonel Latouche, Mr. J. R. HamUton, M.p., and others; and it having been announced that subscriptions to the amount of nearly 810, had been already received, the proceedings terminated, LEEDS. An influential meeting in aid of the fund for the relief of the sufferers in India was held at Leeds on Saturday M.r John Botterill, the Mayor, presided. The CHAIuIAN, after reading s letter of apology for nonattendance from Mr. Beecroft, one of the borough members, which enclosed a subsciption of 20G., briefly opened the proceedings br expressing his sympathy with the object of the meeting, nd his hope that the subscriptioa would bos l iberal one, The ev.Dr. oon Viar o Leds,moved the first resolution, as followiss* "That this meetinag deely sympathizes with the safferos o f ouf fellow-eountrymen emd fellow-countromen in lIndLa; and that, fot lb purPose ct tilng ractical effec to that sympathy, a iubis Ub. hclption be forthwlth raised in Leeds and the neghbeuthood for their ,ellef.- It re asolut ost superfluous, hesaid, to add onewvord to this resolution for every person in that assembly must be waU acqusinied with the sufferings-the unparalleled sufferingsof their countrymen and countrywomen in India, and with the atrocities committed by the mutineers, They must be up and doing, they must strengthen the hanis of the Government, they must call upon their young men to enlist, and he must say, that awful and fearfal as was the confliCt in which they were engaged, he felt proud to know that he had a son who had gone out to fight these savages (applause), and were he (Dr. Hook) a young man he should like to have gone with him. (Renewed anplause.) The resolution was briefly seconded by Mr. 'W. B. DEmSol, and supported by the Rev. J. A. RroDxs, andaunanimously adonted. Mr. E. BAIxn then muoved the appointment of a committee, and, in doing so, he said from his eonsclence he believed that England had not to reproach herself on this occasion with any such faults in the government of Indis as could justify or provoke the outrageous rebellion which had taken place. (Hear, hear) There had been faults in that Government-faults Into which he would not then enter; but those faults had been rather of the nature of neglect, of over indulgence, of over easiness, and of trusting and confiding too much in the natives, than of the nature of oppression, or injustice, or crulty, or of anything that co Td justify the outrageous revolt which had taken place in the native army of IndiI. So far from this oppression and cruelty, there had boee a manifest endeavour on the part of the English Government, of the Governor-General, and of the East India Company, to ameliorate the condition of the people. He did not say they had done all they ought to have done, or that there had been the aetivity enterprise, and ingenuity vwhich thereoughtto have .een-he admitted faults and neglect; but they were not such faults as should now weigh upon their conselences as though they had provoked this rebellion. (Hear, hear.) There had been a great desire to promote the moral, the religious, the educational, and, to some considerable extent also, the subsantial improvement of the people. Hear, hear.) He did, thereore, with a clear conscience rise to move that resolution, and to take part in the wproedings of that 3Ir. 1i. LUPTON seconded the resolution, which was unanimously adopted.

(Lou cheers.) Ift the was the fashion of the present day to refer al misfortunes that had occurred to the Edat Indih Com. pany. No doubt they would have to share a considerable portion of censure, especially with regard to what had beea alleged aainst them in the address :rom the merchants of Caleuttia Besides, they were forewaned by that great captain, Sir CharIes Napler, that the Bengal army was in a mutinous state, and that, therefore, a European force of suflident strength should be maintained at Delhi and other glaces l(Hear ) he Companyhadinthisrespectbeenneglewtnloft eir duty. 2heycould notsaythodanger wasunknown to them when it was pointed out to them by one of the greatest captains this country ever produced, (Cheers.) At the same time he mast add that he had served the EBst India Company, and could say with that great historian, Mills, that on the whole there never was a country better governed than had been India. (Hear, hear.) Then there d been a geat cri In this country, partioulirly by the pressp-esuy by tne frpreeMsnIdia, who were making use of argnments against the education, civilizatlon, and enlightenment of the people of India. But had theynot 150,000,000 of people to govezn in that country, and ought they not to rule them with the samae liberal spirit and with the same justioe as they did In their colonies? (Hear, hear). Ought it not to be a government by opinion and not by the bonet? It was by the influence of opinion and the eghtened spirit of this country that we ought to govern. What wasthis rebellion? It was a mutiny of theBen2al lrmy unp rtcipated libythe people, and even bythearmies gene. raLy of the Presidencies ofombay and adras. (Cheers.) The people remained loyal to the mother country, and in many cases hadprotectedourdestitutebrethren at theriskof their own lives. (Cheers.) Let them only continue in a oourse of enlightened policy, and the sunbeams of hberty and progress would ultimtely shine and fructify over the whore of India. This country could not govern British India as the Czar did the people of Russia, simply because to a great extent the people of Infdi had already been enllght. ened. Itwas not in the power oS the British nation, it was not inthe power of the mightyprea which almost governed this country, it was not in the power of the Imperial Parhament, to bring the people of India back from a ate of comparative moral enlightenment to a state of abject berbarigi. What we wanted doing was to call out themllAtls3,to send aU theforoeswecould maa to sbiag te and punish the rebels-the asaissins-of Bengal and then to reform and re-onstract the Indian army. (lIear, he3r.) They must do that which Sir Charles Napier recommended -the Ghoorkas and people of low caste must be made use of as annhliary forces, so th owe could depend upon them as loyal soldlers.aThe noble EArl then announoed a subscription of 100?.

TH3 INDIAN 3UTINI. Cl A WN IPt1l The A.jr Observer hu been favoured with the follawing a xtract of a letter from General Neill, dated Cawnpore, August :- "I left Allahabad on the 16th and joined General Havelock's force on the 21st, and found poor Major Renaud had been severely wounded. His home Wa first shot under him, a baUet then hit him above the knee, forcing part of the scabbard of his sword into the wound and cusing much suf. I fering. Amputation seemed to afford great relief, and he appeared doing well, when he suddenly expired, comparatively free from pain. He had done right well, and wldl be sinoerely moarned in the regiment (the Fasileers), in which he wasa mch rpected anesteemed. Since I arrived here I have been hard at work to get order re-etablihed. I have now put a stop to the plundering I found going on by reorganizing a poh'ce. I am also collecting all the property of the deceased, and trying to trace if any have survived, but an yet have not succeeded in finding one. Man, woman, and child seem all to have been murdered. As soon as that monster Nena Sahib heard of the success of our troops and of their having forced the bridge about 20 miles from Cawnpore, he ordered the wholesle butchery of the poor womaen and children. I fmd the offieers' servants behaved shamefully, and were In the plot, aU but the lowest caste ones. They deserted their masters and plundered them. Whenever a rebel is canght he is immediately tried, and unles3 he can prove a defence he is sentenced to be hanged at onoe; but the chief rebels or ring' leaders I make first clean up a cortain portion of tho pool of blood, stiU two inches deep, in the shed where the fearfal murder and mutilation of women and children took place. To touch blood is most abhorrent to the high caste natives, they think by doing so they doom their souls to perdition. Let them think so. My object is to inflict a fearful punishment for a revolting, cowardly, barbaroux deed, and to strike terror into tSeee rebels. The first I caught was a subabdar, or native offioer, a high-caste Brahmin, who tried to resist my order to clean up the very blood he had helped to sbed; but I made the Provost-Marshal do his duty, and a few lashes soon made the miscreant acoomplih his task. When done, he was taken out and immediately hanged, snd after death buraed in a ditch at the road side. No one who bhs witnessed the scenes of murder, mutilAtion, and massacre can ever listen to the word 'mercy,' as applled to these fiends. The well of mutilated bodioe-alas I containing upwards of 200 women and children-I have had decently covered in and built up as one large grave. I am in the intrenched camp-a most miserable posltion. None but Englishmen could have held it for a day, and yet how nobly did poor Sir H. Wheeler hold out here I On the 29th General Havelock moved on towards Lucknow. He had not gone far before he came on a strong poet of the enemy, about 20,000 with gans. He defeated them gallantly and took ar their guns, but sustained considerable les Amnong the number, I am sorry to asy, ws young Richardson, a fine, gallant youmg offioer of the Fusileers, whom I had highly noticed at Benares for his gallantry; and young Seton, of the 6th Bengal Native Infantry, was wounded. He was hit in the lower ja6w. He was an aide-de-camp, and made so for his gallantry. The same afternoon the force was again engaged, and again defeated the rebels, taking all their gans, making a total of 20 guns taken, all of which they spiked, and completely gained the day. Notwith. standing this, on the 31st Generl Havelock returned to the bank of the river opposite Cawnpore, where he sent to me for further reinforcements-requiring a battery, two 24-pounders, and 1,000 more European infantry. I have just written to him that there is half a battery coming on here to-day from Allabad, which I send on at once to him. I can also send him two iron guns, but European infantry there is none to send him here. If he waits for that he must wait reinforoments from Calautt, and a long delay, during which time Lucknow may share the fate which befell Cawnpore. The rebels, flushed with victory, will return on this, re-occupy Cawnpore, and I have no troops to keep them out. I must be starved out. The influence, too, on Agra may be most disastrous, but I hope General Havelock, who has been so successful, wil now advanoe gain and relieve Lucknow, which is to be abandoned, the force there brought in here, and by that time reinforcements will have arrived, ready to acoompany General Havelock to Agra and Delhi. The European troops all wear linen blouses and caps; our regiment (the Fusileers) wear blue ones, which in the native language is nod toppice; and the ned toppias are pronounced the terror of all, with their Enfield rifes. They disperse cavaly beautifully. Two hundred of the 2d Cavalry charged young Seton and 12 of our Fusileers; they sent them flying with empty saddles There is a report just brought me that a Rajah has saved some gentlemen, ladies, and three chUdren from the Cawnpore massare, that they are 0 miles off, and tbat he will send them in to me. The next mail will tale all particulars Each day may bring things to light, and my next letter I hope may convey satisfactory intelligence." DELHIL The following is an extract from the letter of a young officer to his friend in York:- A army Head-quaters before Delhi, July 25. "My last was from tkis camp, dated 15th inst., it gave you all news up to that date. I mentioned in that letter that the enemy was coming out; so they did, and no mistike; And about 4 p.m. a brigade left our camp and went at them. My regiment was with this brigade under Brigadier Chamberlain; our men dashed down on the enemy in the sabzieundy,'and after about half an hour's fighting drove them, guns, cavalry, and a large mass of infantry back into Delhi helter-skelter, cavalry, &c., rolling into the ditch, In one part of the fight. The gates were closed against friend and foe, and grape in showers rolled on us and the enemy from the walls, and after cutting up some 500 of them we retired with a loss of 220 killed and wounded; 15 offioers are hit, none mortally, though ChamberLsn got a grape in the upper bono of his left arm (is doing well), and though we were only under fire for About an hour, 65 of our men out of 500 were knocked over. It is madness taking our troops down to the very waUs in this way; had we a fight like this daily our whole camp would be cut up in three weeks, and the enemy are In such force that they can give ton for one. However, we never go beyond our pickets now. " On the 18th the enemy came out agaia on our right, the old place, where they have splendid cover from thick gardens and old buildings. We drove them out, and only lost a fewnmen, as we did not follow them like idiots to the very walls. We lost two officers, Lieutenant C--, Her Maje.tWs 75th-ball between eyes-shot dead; and I doplore to say young W-, of my regiment, was strack down by the sun, -was brought in on a dooly, and, apoplexy comningon, he died in a few hours. He had joinod us about slx months only, and was a fine lad and one of tho most tomperate in camp. He could not stand the san and exposure, as he had been so short a time in theo country. He was buried next morning, and I grieve I could not leave my picket to follow the poor boy to his grave. " We had another brush with the enemy on the 20lh. I was out with my corps, and ve swept the enemy from the mubzieundy In no time. We returned to camp, thank God, as I never was in such a hole in my life. The stench was really sickening, the sight, too, was disgusting;-dead horses, camels, &c., and heaps of dead Sepoys lying about, some half eaten by tho dogs, vultures, &c., who were gorging on the decayed flesh and entrils. On the 23d the enemy came out in great forceo on our left, when we were under arms again, and off we went with the 61st, 8th Company's Rifles, 4th Sikhs, and some gans; down we went on them, and off they went for the right, and we kept up a sharp fire on them. We had goue as far as we were allowed and had tho order to retie We did not lose many men, but the brutes picked out some officers Captain I- was killed; he bad just time to say, 'Take my body off the field; don't let the Pandys get hold of it.' The e nemy have not been out since, so I fancy wegave them enough of it I hear large reinforcement, are ooming here, and I shal be glad wken they come, when we hope to get a little rest. Fancy, beside picket work, our force here have had 24 hard fights with the enemy, already taken above 20 guns, and old officers here say there never was such hard fighting as this in the Crimea I doubt if a British force ever had such hard work before. One-half of s ome of the regiments here bave fallen one way or another. It Wasa fine sight on the 23d. My regiment was the reeerve. We went down the roda in column tm near the enemy, whei4 the 61st and 8th spread out in one grand skirmishing line to the right, the Sikhs and Cokes's to the left our gins In the centre, and my regiment In s perfect line 300 ySids behind. As we neared the enemy our guns opened on theirs and the infantry and cavalry!; the latter bolted off well to the rear with the guns, and the infaatry got under cover and commenced a sharp fire on our advanoing line; the guns also halted and poured in grapo, &c. On went the artillery, &c., sweeping the long gram like a breom, and knockdng the niggers over llk-e fun. It was for half a mile fine open oountry, and our men did their work splendidly, going along at a steady paoe, loading, firing, and driving the niggers on. The balls were flying all round us, but most were ioo high andrwent a long way over us; however, every now and then you would see a poor dear fellow drop orer and carried to the rear on the back of the man on his right, and the expression of the face was a sad sight compared with the same jnst a moment before while loeding sad firing and sweeping everything before him. At lat we got oLr men with the long range rifles in good plaees, and ent the enemy sway to Delhi sharp; after which we fell in, like in parade, under our brave major, and retired, having done our work, tbough faggea and awfully done up b7 the hleat and exoitement, I bad a good look at the wrals, &o., of Delhi fom the top ci a houwe where wewre. We wre eloee to the Wals, ad I noticed the crest of the glae proteeb about six feet of the bse of the wall, as I etld only ae halfway down the gateaay. I also notloed how Well the enemy fight iul is way. They get into holes, behind stones, &c., and ,fire aray, and off they go to another place as you make he last boletoo hot for them; th skirmish and can do bah fighting splendidly. t SSW ome of them quite close, work. ng their firelocks perfectly. Then they were the genuleU3 Sepoy bmtes who a few monUts before were licking my feet, and with the most exquiste acting expressing all tha$ one could vish to se in those under one. Before I went to Cashmere last April my havildar c"me up and said my company wished to come up and salm toMe am d wish me a safe journey and return, when they Intended to txpre. the dellght they would have in seeing me hick, &a. I told him to give my ualam, and that I would not trouble them, as It is a bore to them put. ting on their uniform, &a., but that he was to thak them for me. These very beatst had plotted the mutiny, and intended the murder of all in Ferozepore long before rny two months' leave could expire. I fancy you wiU all blame us fellows for not knowing what was going on with the" men; but temember this, they have gone on all right for ICO years. Head-quarters were informed of the great disaffection among the Sepoys dix months bak, and no European can fathom the idark black viULany of the natires Your words of advioe I have never forgotten, ' Beware of tha craft and treachery of the Asiatic.' To teU yoa the truth, I never could understand the Sepoys; they are queer fel. lows, but I never expected they were so bad. I have, bowever, long come to the conclusion tha' a native of India is exwtly contrary to an Englishman in every way, and in everything he does, or makes, or has anything to do with. This Is their truecharacter; judge of them accordingly, and mark these words of mine, and notioe in what you ever knew of them if this is not so, and if I had my way I would treat them exactly different from the way one msnages Europeans, and alU would be right. " I suppose you are ll astounded with the news from Indla; so you msy be, but don't be alarmed; we re all right, tnd, barring the mischief of xad murders, lndia is ours now more than ever it wa, We hive held it by ooaxing and sufferance up to this, now we will hold It by right. We keep India at bay now, what shlU we do when 50,000 or more Europeans join from England, and the whole oountrJ is disarmed? At preent aU the Bongal army, cavalry, infantry, some 100 regiments of 1,000 strong, and about haLf that of Irregulars have risen vainly in arms againat us It is hard lork just nowv; all the same, I never saw foUows mnore jolly than those in this camp. It is surprising. what one can do when one must do it We can't go at, Delhi, I regret to say, til reinforced; the plsce is a maze of narrow lanes, wcme dark from being so narrorw, and thousands of them. We dare not let our brave boys loose on them; in suchaplaze 5,000 men would be loals and it's no use going in tiU we can scour it out properly, and at present it is not bad policy keeping the brutes cooped up there by thousands instead of letting them ravage over the whole country. I expect the King finds his palace rather uncomfortable. One of our large mortars is pitching 10. inch shells right into the place. The enemy also fight worse and worse every time they come out, and, now that they can't do anything with us and hear of our strong reinforcements coming north and south, they are losing beart, and think they have made a sad mistke in supposing the Company's reign is over. I expect, however, Delhi will not fall for a month yet; slow and sure, but down it comes for ever this time." THE MUTINY AT INDORE. The following letter ias from a IAdy, the worthy daughter and wife of soldiers - " August 5. "Here w are at )lhow, after one month of most un. pleasant wanderings and exposure. . . How glad was I to eee the wing of Her Majegtys 14th Dragoons. They do look like soldiers, but it is grievoudy mortifying to think that, had we had half that wing at Indore on the lIt of July, HIolkar's troops would soon have been dispersed, and we saved the distress and vexation of retring. We had boped that by God's mezuy we should have escaped the horrors that have been perpetrated around us, the Resident having done all in his power to insure the safety of the plaoe, though, after all, we well knew it was but an ap. pearance of strength, none knowing how far the variouv Irregular troops that we had were to be relied npon in a state of actual ned. But in the morning of the outbreak It soon became cvident wbat a dastardly rabble we had as our defenders; for, on the first firing of Holkas's guns, they seemed panlc.stricken, and never were able to recover from the surprise. In vain the native 6ioers were called upon to exert themselves Neither ihey nor the Europeans had any influence over these men, and (though on our side) they were wholly un. manageable for any defensive operations, Colonel Traver hoping they would follow him, made a dash at Holkar's guns, but not above five of his cavalry followed him. Had even 20 or 30 men backed Colonel Travers he would have taken Holkas three gn Shortly after other guns were brought up against ut Our own two returned fire steadily, but then Holkar's were moved and poured grape and round shot into the Residency. The whole of the infantry exoept the Bheels, who were posted inside the Residency and in the verandah,,deeerted us, neithor loading nor obeying orders, but finaUy threatening to shoot the officers Guns, cavalry, and infantry were continuing to arrive, whUe rabble from the city were pouring up. Numbers of persons had already been killedby theotroops of the Maharajah (women and children), but a great many ha succeeoded in reaching the Residency. It was now urged by all tht unles3 we took advantage of the present moment escape would be Impossible, and a general msacre would folow. The cavalry, whlch was our sole relianoe, were preparing to fly, their only thought being to save their own lives, and ours also, provided we choes to accompany them; if not to leaTe us to onr fate. Under the eircumstances retreat seemed the only alternative, and the order was rmost reluctantly given by the Resident. He and others had hoped to hold out til relief oould arrive from Mhow. Our carriages and horses were in the hands of the mutineers. We, ladies and children, &c., retreated at the back of the house, while the guns were raklng the front. We mounted the gun waggons, sitting upon shot and powder boxes, and wereslowly dragged by bullocks. The guns, with the few cavalry and some infantry who did not deert us, foUowed with the officers As we retreated over the plain we saw the smoke of the burning bungalows, and for some time heard heavy firing, the shot from the enemy's guns passing close amtong us; mercifully not a soul was hit. I kept continually looking back to see that - was safe. Of course, I could but be truly thankful that our livea were spared; but I confess I felt keenly with - the mortifica. tion of being compelled to lve owithout our troope having made a good stand. As to fear, that was far less present with me than vexation and digust at the conduct of the wretched cowards who were our sole relianos With 100 European soldiers we should have held the phlc Often had I felt and said, when the circle of insurrection was closing around us, and when some were discussing the dangers of our position and the propriety of the ladies being seut away, that -vwould never yield while there was the sightest hope of holding our ground, and that, as far as my feelings went, I would rather my husband should remain at his post, at whatever risk of life, than desert, run away (or whatever you may calIt), unless we were unsupported or overpowered by numbers ;-whatever alarm I might feel I should neither sabmit to the ignominy of flight (unle. under those cireum. stances), nor leave my husband without knowing what migbt happen . gave 3- the account of our three days and three nights of wandering, with little rest and not much food, no clothes to change, burning sun, or deluges of rain. but - and I, perhaps, oould bear these things better than others, and suffered le.

The Residency is uninhabitable, and almost all have lost everything. I might have ssved a few things in the hour and a-half that elaped between the outbreak and our retreat, but I had so relied on aome of our defnders, and felt so seure of hold. lug on, that flight never for a moment occurred to me.

I IrELAND. GOVERNM3ET InQUBY AT BFLFAST. (FBOX oua OWN COREPcxNDKnT.) D1XBLIN. SATURDAY MOiNTua- une case lor the .loman Uatholio party has been at length brought to a close, and the Orangemen are now upon their defence. Yesterday (Friday) the Rev. Mr. Hanna was produced, and aunderwent a long examination, in the course of which the rev. gentleman was thus interrogated by Ar. Lynch, one of the Comnmissioners*- "M Mr. Lynch.-If you supposed a riot would ensue,would you consider it your duty to preach in the open air? " ltev. Mr. Eanna.-I did not think that a riot would ensue from my street preaebing. "Mr. Lynoch-But would you conceive It your duty to preach in the open air if you had reason to beieve that a riot would ensue? '9 Rev. Air. Harma.-I would; our, most valuable rights have been obtained by conflict, and if they are to be main. ta&ed we must notlook to the consequences. ' "Mr. Lynch.-Do you know that open-air preaching ws formerly practised in this town? " Rev. MIr. Hanna.-Extensively, and without opposi. tion; on the 12th of July last 10 er 12 of my fathers and brethren in the church preachedin theopensirtthereportof the GeneralAssiembly on open-airpreachingwas handedin to the Comminssioner]; theGeneral Assembly was then holding its meeting in Belfast, and a ninmber of the country ninis. ters were in town at the time. "Mr. L hnb.-Doyon know that the proceedings of the 12th of rXly l^flt caused considerable excitement in the town ? "Rev. Mr. Hanna.-Yes. "Mr. Lynch.-That you look upon as temporary excite. ment? "Rev. Mr. H-snn-Yes; Ihope that it will net become c ronic. "1 Mr. Lynch.-Was it not in consequence of that excitement that the clergymen of the church of England desisted from open air reaching ? " Rev. Mr. Hnnua-Yee, I apprehend it was. "Mr. Lynch.-They hoped that this temporary excitement would pass by, and then that they ought to resume open.air preaching . "Rev. Mr. Rnna.-.I have no doubt that that was their feelng; but the precedent was a bad one, as it is always dangerous to succumb to a mob. I consider that the anthorsties are bound to protect the rights of citizens, and as am)ob must be put down some time, the sooner it Is done thebetr "Mr. Lytuc-What do you call the mob? "Rev. Mr. Hanna.-I call those the mob who opposed open-air preaehing in particular. " To Mr. Thompson.-The place that I selected for preaching is removed from the Roman Catholic district. I selected it for that purpose. There is almost no popula. tion in that neighbourhood, and the people who live tbare are not Roman Catholics. My first address waz published on the 10th of September. That is the address without a date; it is the printer's mistake, and I hand in a copy of the Belfast Da'y Mercury of the 1th, which states that the address was posted ap 'last niight.' I am aware that an attempt has been made to show that the address was pub. lished before that date, but it is incorrect. I preached in the Corn-Exchange previously. I refrained from preaching in the open air after having bad a conference with some distinguished ministers of my church. I am right, and I will always be right. ' IMr. Lynch-Would it not be better to allow the ex. citement to pass by? " Rev. MH. Hanna.-That is a thing that I deny. I deny that there is anything that produces a riot in street preaching; and I do not say that, notwithstanding existing excitement, I am not at present justified in the discharge of my duty, which in its nature has no element to produce a riot. The remedy *z to correct the souee of misrepresentation. * Cross-examined by Mr. OTRorke.-I am not an Orange. man, and have had some political difference with the Orangemen. I am aware that the ship capenters have the namo of being connected with the Orangemen. Some Orangemen have ceaaed to be connected with my church. I consider it my right to preach in the open air, and I wil never yield my rights either to a man or a mob. " [The expression of this sentiment caused an explosion of apDlause in the court, which was greatly crowded. The Comnissioners endeavoured to put a stop to the applause, but It continued notwithstanding for some minutes.]" The Belfast Mercury, in a lengthened review of the evidence so far as it haa been given, comes to the conclusion that the origin of the 12th of July riots is clearly tracealale to the drunken conduct of one of the Roman Catholic party, while the drtum beating and the sermon at Dr. Drew's church may have prepared the minds of the population for the subsequent explosion. The Mercury insists that the perpetrators of the outrages are strangers to the town. These persons, it appears, unused to high wages,- "HAve become Inflated with a bastard Independence. They are ignor manfad turgbulent to such a degree that no town in the epre could parallel them as being more brutal in passion, more savage in their party animuosities, or more thoroughly de moralize d as8 regard e all that con stitutes a civilization babsed on moral and religiouts culture." The writer adds . "<The very mnanutfcturing and commercial enterprise thait has made our tewn the industrial capital of Irehland has also accumulrted this vicious population to an extent that it Is really fearful to contemplate. It is not that the heads of families are ignorant and brutl * the evil pervades all the social relations of themasses. Therein sea clyany opportutnity afforded for the cultivation of the domestic feelings-household ties are scarcely formed ere they are broken asnder. Chilciren at an early age become ~ijdependent of their parents-work is so plentiful, andwa es so tempting, that the great mass of children become perfectly independent of parental control by their twelfth year. They do not remain at school. They crowd into our mills and factories, and in a short time any good that they received at school is obliterated. They are emancipated from all control just at the time when control, if wisely exercised, would be most valuable to them, and the result of all this is to be observed in the class of crimes which for the most part occupy our police court. Fathers beating children, children rebelling against their parents, husbands assaulting wives, and sons beating mothers-prosecutions for drunkenness, commnon assaults, and petty thefts, sand the use of obscene and profane language,-such are the crimes with which the plicesheet is daily crowded. This population is not, we repeat in digenous to Belfasb. It ha bec n collected hastily togethef, from various quarters, by the sudden growth and wonderful expansion of our manufactuing and commercial prosperity. The great mass of it is Roman Catholic in zeli. gion-at least as far as profession goes. It is intensel ignorant, fuU of prejudices, ver bryta), ana very cowardi. It bas few local attachments, and is not as yet well bound together to act in concert, with organization and discipline. The antagonistic mob, the Orange party, in many respects presents remarkable contrasts.

TO THE, EDITOR OF TRB TIME& Sir,-Your paper of the 18th haa just reached me. Your correspondent "P" has very sadly, though I am smre unintentionally, misrepresented my opinions. I have spoken but once on the subject of India. It was in reference to an order for the special enlistment of high caste natives, and the homage thus paid to Hindoo superstitions; and, so far as I can recollect, I said,- " I desire to see Christanity diffased throughout India, butI do not desire a crusade of the Government against the prejudices and religion of the people. AU that shotdd be left to the silent operations of the missionaries. But if the Government are not to enforce Christianity, neither are they to enforce idolatry, &a." Allow me to add that it is high time for the Government of India to declare itself to be a Christian Government, and that it will protect and countenance all its co-religionists in every legitinate effort to promulgate and advance the truth. It should equally declare that the weight of authority shall not be brought to bear either to advance our faith or extinguish the faith of others. All that wo require in India is a complete religious equality; and if the Hindoos and Mahomedans, singly or conjointly, choose to form associations for the promulgation of their creeds, and imitate our proceedings, let them do so as freely as ourselves, provided they keep within the limits of law and order. But if Christianity may not be taught in the Government schools they had better leave the schools altogether to the labours and zeal of the nusaionary bodies. It is monstrous that in a country like India the ruling powers (being themselves Christian) should establish places of instruction, and by an official decree exclude the Bible. Whatcould more degrade both them and their faith in the eyes of Asiatics? Let the Govenment be earnest and energetic in the multiplication of railroada, canals, electric telegraphs, and the introduction of British enterprise and capital, and we may be assured that such men as have been and are stil in India will, by the blessing of God, take very good care that Christianity shall not lag behind. I am. Sir. vonr olwciPnt .fiPn n IIAEThBURY, Lucer=e, Spf, 23,
THE LATE TAVISTOCK ELSCTION. The following correspondence relating to the Tavistock election has been published; "Woburn Abbey, Sept. 7, 1857. "Sir,-I have read a report of the speech delivered by yo at a meeting of your supporterg at fEavistock on Wednesday lust ad cannot deny myself the pleasure Of thaning you, which I do most truly, for what you were so good as to say about me in that speech, and for She justice you did to my sentiments and invariable praetic3 in contested elections It has ever been a ruls with me to leave my tenants to the free exercise of their opinions, feeling that, whatever my own wishes may be, I have D9 claim on their political consciences. But, although abtlainiog from all interferene with their votes, I cannot admit that the circumstanoe of my posessing proprt and s stake in the welfare of a county or borough is virtually to disqauAfy ny member of my family from offering himself to the free choice of the electors-a doctrine that would Jead.Jo the arbitrua exclusion of one elass only, and be incompatible with true liberty.

"BEDFORD." "35, Albert-square, Clapham-road, Sept. 10, 1857. "My Lord Duke,-I have the sincerest gratification in;aknowledging your Grace's letter of the 7th inat.,,in which you do me the honour to express your thanks for what Isaid concerning your Grace at Tavistock. I feel that I am scarcely entitled to any such kindly recognition. I spoke only wat I thought and felt; but it is pleasant to. have your Grace's Assurance that I did not misinterpret your spirit. "Allow me to add, that Ifancy your Grace misapprehends the disposition of my supporters. Of course, I can say but little, naving enteredTavistock for the first tima onthe day before the nomination, and not having had the advantage of a previous acquaintanceship with a smigle individaal in the place. From what I gathered during my brief sWty in the town, howrever, my impression was that no suspicion isentertained that your Grace vishes to make any claim on the political oonscienoes of your tenantry but, at thesame time a strong belief that were vourGrace fliy aquainted withl the facts you would find that some persons in your Grace's employ have not acted in the spirit of your intentions, but have, contrary to your ex pressed desire, brought the weight of your Gracee's name and intluence to bear upon several of your tenants for the purpose of swaying their votes at the late election. "I shall have much pleare in transmitting to them by this ot a co of your Gz s letter, E d "I have the honour to be, my Lord Duke, with sentiments of unfeigned respect, your Gras most obedient ervant, " EDWARD ZdIALL. ",To his Grace the Duke of Bedford," "My Lord Duke,-May it please your Grace, we beg to submit a concise history of the pr.oeedings in connexion with the recent Parliamentary onatest for the borough of Taxistock. "- The retirement of the Hon. G. Byng, the appearance of Mr. Arthur Russell as candidate, and the receipt of the 'writ were known together on Saturday morning, August the 29th, before the publication of Mr. Byng's fareweU Aiddress to the electors; it being an important fact that there was no post to London on that day. "i n the evening a small meeting of electors took place, the new candidate, with ir. Hastings Russel, ML, being present; alsO Mfesss Pryse Micheli and Terrell, by whom the HIon. Gerge Byng was introduced to the electors at his first election. "On the majority of those who attended an impression was made that Mr. Arthur Russell was not the right rnan in the right place. Acting under this feeling some of the electors beld another meeting, and drew up a requisition to Sir William Clay, requesting him to come forward as a candidate. In a few hours this requisition was so signed as to justify sending a deputation to Sir W. Cly, whose answer to a letter forwarded resahed Tavistock after the election. " Communications aso took place with Mr. ILyard, who went to consult Lord John RusselL "The Right Hon. Milner Gibson could not be found. At length the services of Mr. Edward Miall, late MY. for Rochdale, were secured, it having been a main object to procure a gentleman of experience and ability, and who had en a member of tbe House of Commons. "While this occurred out of Tavistock, on Monday morning, August 31, thne electors met in the ball-room to hear a comxaunicationrfrom Mr. Pryse MichelL " At this meeting, according to the report published by a requisitionist to Sir WllFiam Clay, though not a supporter of Mr. Mill, Mfr. Pryse 3fichell said he was authorized in stating to the meeting that it was the wish of the Duke of Bedford that every elector should be left to his owx free choloe to vote for any candidate he might think proper; at the same time he believed that the Duke of Bedford would be much gratified if the choice of the eleoctors should fallupon hisnephew. Mr.James Nichollsinquired if thecomraunication from the Dake of Bedford was not intended for the public? Mr. Prse MicheU did not at first acknowledge that he had received any direct oommunication from the Duke, stating that if he had received a letter addressed to the constiuents he certainly should have read it to them; but, on being pressed by Mr. James Nicholls as to whether he had received any letter from the Duke of Bedford, he, acknowledged that he Wad received a private letter, but as a matter of etiquette he could not read it to them without the sanction of the writer. "After this the following resolution was passed:- That a deputation from the meetingehould wat upen Mr. Arthur Bune51 andak him to meet the electors, arnd take the opinio of the mneetlig sz to?wbetber or not they sbould wishhim to withdraw.' II In the evening a large meeting was held. The deputation reported that Mr. Arthur Russell declined to attend the meeting or be guided by its opinions. Before he ventured to do so hbe would watt the arrival of another candidate. As there was at prewent no other gentleman in the field, he did not see that he was called upon to resign. If some other candidate should make his appearance, he would then place the matter In the hands of his committee, aud act according to their decision. He was in the hands of his committee, and would be guided by their opinions. These sentiments were expressed by Mr. Bastings Russell, M.P., on behalf of Mr. Arthur RusselL " The meetiu, on this being communicated, passed the following resolation:- -I *That this meeting In cl opninon that Mr. Arthur Bussel Is not a lit peson to repreasut this boeuh InParliaxment-' " This was carried by acclamation, although opposed by 3Mr. C. V. Bridgman, an attorney, who moved aa amendment, but found no seconder. " On Wednesday afternoon Mr. Miall arved, issued an address, and in the evening held a public meeting in the ball-room, from which boys were excluded. The room and the avenues to It were densely crowded. Mr. Hastings R>ussell, MY., was present. After Mr. miall's address questionswere put by one of Mnr. Arthur Russell's supporters, and before the conolusion the following resolution, opposed by Mfr. C. V. Bridgman, attorney, was carried, not. unanimously, there being according to the chairman's unquestioned decision three against it: "' *That the persousattenlding this mneeting pledge themnselves so use thleir interest to setusu idwar ? ,ilal o the Clommons' House of Par liament as the reprcsentativ-c of this borough.' "On the foUowing mornig the nomination took place, Mr. Arthur Rumsell was proposed, not by the chairman of his comtittee (who had previously stated that he was ashamed to canvass for him, as ho had been asked to do, and that it was a pity that the Duke should send such a man), but by Mr. J. H. Gill, and seconded by Mr. Robert May, a highly respectable yeoman, a Conservative, and tenant of your Grace. " Edward Miall was proposed by Mr. Thomas Nicholls, and seconded byMr.IPi.Sleman. " It baving been asserted that your Grace's views had been misrepresented b'y r. Miall's supporters, Mr. E. Sleman called upon Mr. Arthur Russell's committee to produce a copy of the correspondence between Mr. Pryse Michell and the Duke of Bedlford, then in the possession of Mr. Arthur Russell's comrnittee - this the chairman, acting under thc advice of Mr. C. V. iridgman, attorney, declined to do. " On a show of hands, the Portreeve declared that Mr. Mial was elected, whereupon Mr. J. H. Gill demanded a poll. At the close the numbers were declared to be- Russell ... ... .. ... .. 164 mia ..1. ... ... ... .. 120 Majority ... ... . ..-44 "Inclusive of one vote tendered for Lord Russel and another for Lord William Ruesel there are 102 names on the electoral list not recorded. Of these not 20 are Conservatives, and only 4 ate yeomen; 164 is not one-half of the consituency. Of the electors residing in the town 116 votedfor Miall; 88 for Russell; 95 did not vote. The 88 town voters do not form one-third of the town electors, whose number is about 300. In the town Mr. Miall had a majority of 28. Among the neutrals were Mr. Pryse Michell a4d Mr. Terrell, who introduced the Hon. George Byng to the electors. " Both the propoer and seconder of Mr. Miall voted for Mfr. Byng at the last general election, when 242 persons voted for the Hon. G. Byng. (Your Grace's agents did not on that occasion cavass.) 96 of these did not voto for Mr. Arthur RuselL Anong the 164, to speak within bounds, theze are not more than 50 who are neither In your Grace's employ nor tenants or pensoners. " An activo canvass waS nrosecuted by the clerks in your Grace's office, and by others in your Grace's employ; this zas done openly. We admitted their seal-and tbat they did al in their power, the number of yeomen, three of your Grace's tenants unnolled, one being ill, proves this, and if it requires confirmation, this is afforded by the fact that tbe last person poled for 1r.

" We also forbear to expreas sentiments uttered by some of the tenants, ad enlge upon one being induobd to vote for'Rusell because MS had no fields to let.

CAVALRY FOR INDIA. TO THE EDTOBR OF TEE TIM2ES. Sir,-Numerous letters have appeared in your cotumns relative to the raising of volunteer regiments for India; and in your paper of the 23d ins. is a letter signed " Zouave," stating that " a cavalry regiment is to be raised in England and Australia." Why go to the trouble of sending to far when thern e plent of men to be had in England ? What first ought to be done Is this. Let the East India Company get permission from Government to raise Earopean cavalry for Indian service; let them recruit at once, and take men at 5 feet 4 inches (and I would venture to say I could raise 1,000 volunteers in a very ahort time). A regiment of men of 6 fect 4 inches to 5 foet 6 inches could easily be motmted in India, and would be invaluable thero, particuarly inW the present crisis. We want Light Cavalry in India, not bulk. ing fellows of 5 feet 9 inches. The East India Company have plenty of offlicars, and the men oould be formed into regiments at once and sent out as soon as they can be equipped. Non-commissioned officers could be procured by application to the Horse Guards; or, if that failed, there are plenty of discharged, cavalry men who would willingly reenter the cavalryservioeif they had the opportunity. All our Dragoon regimeats are much too heavy for India. Men for cavalry service in India ought not to be above 5 feet 8 inches; but 5 feet 6 inches is a better height, aud a regiment such as I propose to be formed would do good service In India, and recruits could also be procured in abundanoe. The East India Company have the officers of the late 10 regiments of regular Benpl Light Cavalry on their hauds, and these would officer fve regiments of dragoons for service in India* and they ought to be stationed throughout the three presidencies. I have seen numbers of well made men rejected by the recroii!ng sergeant because they were under satndard height. ihese are the very men I would take, as many have been all their lives accustomed to horses. Should you deem the above worthy of insertion in nie Times you will oblige one who has served many yeals in India, I encdose my card and remain, Your obedient servant. Sept. 24.
THE INDIAN ARTILLERY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIRES. Sir,-In 21 Timm of the 23d inst. there appears a leter signed "P. Phipps, Colonel, Bengal army," which contains the following paragraph-vi7., "Another prevailing mistake is to suppose that the Comnpany's artillery Is composed of natives, where"s, with the exception of a few companies, the whole is English, 'while in the Horse Artillery the drivers alone are natives." How any person belonging to the Bengal army, or who possesses tho smallest knowledge of its constitution, could make such a statement I am wholly at a loss to conceive. I have now a BcngaZ Avrmy rAt before me, from which I will proceed to extract the particulars besring apon the point in question. And, first of all, we will take the Horse Artillery. There are threebrigades, consisting in the aggregate of nine European troops and four native troops. Each European troop has 80 gunners attached to it, giving a total for the nine troops of 720 European gunners Each native troop bas90 troopers attached to it, giving a totl of 360 native troopers. In addition to the above there is a native Iscar detail attached to each native troop, amounting for the whole four troops to 312, so that the aggregate of European privates in the Horse Artillery is 720, and of native privates 672. We now turn to the Foot Artillery, which I find to consist of nine battalions, six of which are Earopean and three are native. Each European battalion consists of 240 gunners which for the six battalions, will give a total of 1,440 gunners. Ech native battalion consists of 528 privates, whioh for the three battalions 'will give a total of 1,584 privates. But, in addition to this, there is attached to every company of Europeans a gun Lascar detail, amounting in all the six European batslions to a total of 681 privates; so that the aggregate of European privates in the Foot ArtiUlery is 1,440, and of native privates 2265. Summing up both branches, horse and foot, it will appear that the European privates are 2160, and the native privates 2,937. Tho foregoing comprises the Artillery of the regular army only. The large force of Artillery with the irregular corps and contingents was wholly native. Attached to various corps and contingents I can reckon up, from the Armsy List, 20 guns. In other cases the number of guns is not men. tioned. But there is a local company of Artillery in Am with 90 privates, 60 more In the Bhopal Contingent, and 352 in the Gwallor Contingent; and 462 in the Oude Irregulars. I have not reckoned the Hyderabad and Nagpore Artillery, as they are not exclusively Bengal men ; neither the Panjab Artillery, as they are on our side; bat the reader will not fail to perceive that the great preponderance of Artillery in Bengal consisted of natives, instead of their being limited to a few companies, as stated by Colonel Phippe. I am, Sir. Tour obedient servant. BENGALBI.
BRBONSTRUCTION OP THE BENGAL AMY. (From the Ezaminer.) The Pzmy of Benga, which hk sunmod out to be Ao" better than a huge band of dexterous, traitors end disiplined sswnins, hax virtaly ceased to exist, for of the 84 regimets of regar infntry and cavalry of which It wa4 eompesed, there are but Ave that have notopenly mutinied, and of these fire ther ix but one that can be trasted, that one onsisting of Ghooskas. Wat, theLiae we to substitute' for this extihet force? Tbo queon is one of the first moment, and we propose to thorow oit a few hints in answer to It.C The first and obvious resouwos will con4t in an inoreae of the European element, which has heretofore been to the Indian in the ratio of 1 to 24, tho danger of the disproportion having bQen Immensely aggrvate by the character of the native masterial.L The proportion of guropeaus, however, Shat ca be maintained eit be limitx d by the nature of the climate and by the cost. The last oondition, however, will provo no obstacle, as may easly be demonstrated. The oost of an Eoglih dragoon serving in India ha bon oomputed at 901., While that of a regalar native trooper oomes to 731. Fotr xative troo, therefore, a" eomputed to cost the Stte as muci as three Eglh dragoons; but s this proportion by no mean expresse the relaive valtet of tbe two descriptions of force on the day of battle, the only time when either is tried, it is ortain that the naeve cavalry, for the servioe it is capable of rendering, is Incomparably the more expensive foroe of the two. The Bengal regular;csvalry constitutes, in fact, the most costly and the leas efficient part of the entire Indian amy, and never ought to be reorganized. Every one that knows, or rather knew them, will readily admait that 1,000 English dragoons would tranple down sad cut to pieces the entire 5,000 of which the body oonsists, and consider it no pet exploiL Let ns now compare in point of expense t9ie regular Indian infanttry ith the Bnrtish. The computed cost of &a English foot soldier serving in India is o, 10, and that of a regular Bepo 211. s, One English foot aoldier, then, coats lea than two Sepoys; but all w ho are acqainted with the hitory of our Indian Wars will at once admit that tbhi is far indeed from their relative valuer as s6ldierg, setting altogether aide assured lolty n one xide, pnd, a far as Bengal In ooe rnko, ascertsined treton on the other. AU the grt battles ave been won, and all stTong fortresFes captured, maily by our uropeLu troops, and asuredly never in action have our Sepons borne anything like the proporton to our Buropean troops that the auxilisries of Rome did to her legions. It was our own countrymen, and not Sepoys, t'hat assaulted and carried the breach at Serinppatan. When Sir Eyre Coote won his great and dcisive battle apinst Count LAly, the Sepoys of his arrmy were only speciators In the late battles on the Sutlej and in the Pn ab our Sepoys, if left to themselves, although admirably led by Englibh officers, would bave been inevitably routed by the supeior prowess of the Sikbh. Without European officers, in fact, a 8epoy force ig but a rabble. This trath has beea conspicuous throughout the present rebellion. At Delhi, for example, although in possession of our magazines, and backed by ramp-rt, intrenchments, ruins, and ravines, they are everywhere defeated by handfuls of Europeans-nay, for that matter, by handfuls of Sikhas and Ghoorkas, At their futl strength, the regular infantry of Bengal would amount to 73,000 men. These would cost the State, at the rate we have quoted, 1,551,250., a sum which would be sufficient to maintain near 40,000 British infantry, onefourth part of which wottld overmatch all the Sepoys in India. In so far, then, as the capacittr of fighting is concerned, whether as regards cavalry or infantry, the European force is not only the more efficient, but by far the more economical of the two, and hence it foloira that the emplozment ofsa native army, ildependent of its now ascertainee perfidy, isa source of waste, and not of saving. As to the native artlllery, independent of the objectionsto which it is liable in oommon with the cavalry and infantry, there i'a stil more serious one to which it is specialy open. Artillery is the favonrite arm of the natives, and the only one in which they make anyting like an approach to the skill of Europeans. This Is testified by the well-known facts that inall our battles vith the native Powers it was the artillery that opposea the ehief resistance, the 6annoniers standing to their guns, while the cavalry never ventured to faee ours, and the infantry fled at onoe at the British cheer and the rush of our bayonets. But the climate of India forbids, for ordinLary servicer, the use of European troop These must be busbanded and wel cared for. Hyder , who war a man of genius and forecast, used to say that if he had asueb soldiers he would have every man of them carried in a Ianquin. Regular troops, of an inferior descnption, capable of withstanding a tropical sun, must be also employed, and these assredly oug t not to be natives of Hindostan, saving allways Ghoorha anad Siks, who are very little EIindooe, and not at All Mahomedans, but hating both. In addition to these last we have a choce of Mlays, Burmese, end Africans, either our own sub)ects or thooe of native States. The Malays have been tried by ourselves and by the Datcb, and found to mnake very brave and obedient soldiers Africans have Also been fouid to make useful soldiers as in our West India regiments, and on a still larger scale in the Bastern possessions of the Dutcb, where it Is stated that there is at present a force of this descriptlon amounting to 8,00, first organized after a four yeas ibelbion of the zatives of Jva. The Bnarmese are brave and docile, and, serving in India, where they dgrewith e natives in race, langaage, religion, ana manners, we doubt not they would make efficient troops. Any force levied from the natives of rindoetan, with tbe exceptions before named, ought, in our opinion, to consi6t of no more than A well-organizod and well-paid police, without fire-arms. Such a forco trained by, and under the direction of European offEcers-a force resembling In its constituion, as nearly as the Inferiornature of the raw material wrould allowr, the Irlsh constabuly-would be a desirable substitute for the eistingocorrupt and inefficient civil police, which, onaenhsnds, io dmitted to bea disgro to a civlisdnation.

T:RIMPRJAL MBETING -A STUTTGART. (FROM OUR SPBCIAi 00OU TDJ'.) STUTTGART, SEPT. 24. The Emperor of Rumsia arrived at 4 o'clock p.m. st the Feuerbach station of the railway which had brought him from DarmstAdt. Ile was attended by Prince Gortachakoff, but not accompanied by the Ermpress. He was, however, very nearly having the Princess Mathilde, the cousin of the Emperor Louie Napoleon, to share the special train which brought him hither; but it would seem that she did not arrive so punctually as was expected at the frontier station, and therefore the Emperor's train came on without her, and another train has been despatched to fetch her. The Ccown Prince of Wurtemberg and the Princess wenat out to Bruchsal, the last station on this aide of the Baden frontier, to receive the Emperor, and the King was in waiting to receive him at the Feuerbaeh station, and had been waiting a good hour when he arrived. The King, who is now 76 years of age and a great lover of simplicity, sat quietly all that time with his own Adjutant in an open barouche, aurrounded by and exposed to the notice of the sight-loving crowd that had collected to see the Emperor, the only special attention shown to Royalty on this occadon being the precaution of watering the road where his carriage would have to stand. There was no gaping at him, no mobbing, and no hurrahing, only hats taken off. The Crown Prince and Princess on their arrival with the Emperor drove off promptly in their carriage, which with several others were in waiting for the Emperor's immediate suite, as they had to prepare for the reception of their Imperial brother and brother-in-law at their villa in the neighboturhood of Stuttgart, known under the name of the Crown Prince'sVilla. After a few minutes of greeting and compliments the King conducted the Emperor to his own private carriage, and, on the latter's motioning him to take precedence, at once mounted before his younger relative, who, however, sat at the King's right hand. The Emperor wore on this occasion his Russian uniform, with the weU known frightful turban-shaped fur cap with the red band of the Saxon Order of the Crown, and looked hot, tired, out of humour, and out of health. In face at least he has rapidly grown old since he mounted the throne, and his present looks give some strength to the unsatisfactory reports that are current of the state of his health and his habits of life. He wiiU remain the guest of the Crown Prince of Wurtemberg and of his sister the Grand Duchess Olga during the whole term of his stay. The Emperor Louis Napoleon, on the other hand, who is expected to arrive to-morrow, will be the guest of the King, and will stay with him in the New Palace. Each Emperor will dine to-morrow en faniUe with his host and his immediate circle, and in the evening the King will take his guests with him to an evening entertainment to be given by the Crowvn Prince to the two Emperors, their very limited and select suites, and the members of the Royal Family of Wurtemberg. It will be at this evening party to-morrow that the two Emperors, one of whom at least has made unceasing efforts for more than a year past to bring about a meeting, will make each others acquaintance. As the early departure of the post leaves me scarcely time to send this off to you, I will postpone any further remarks of a political character, adding only that, according to the little I have been able as yet to gather of the intended arrangements, the two!lEmperors will have very little time left them in private to settle the new arrangement of the map of Europe which some politicians expect. To judge from the appearance the streets of Stuttgart presented yesterday afternoon, the principal feature of which was mattresses and bedding in a state of fierce locomotion, at least one-half of the population must have been occupied in improvising sleeping accommodation for the streams of visitors that continue to flow in as each railway train disgorges its freight on the platform. The amount of excitemnent and fuss caused in a quiet South Germani population of some 35,000 Will be easily conceived when I recount that besides the visit of the Emperor Alexander of Russia to-day, and of the Emperor Louis Napoleon to-morrow, Stuttgart rejoices at the present moment in being the trysting place of the German Evangelical Kirchentag, or Diet of the Churches, and moreover encloses within her precincts also at this identical juncture a considerable number of the representatives of German art, whose deliberative raeetings are held in the Stijndehaus, or Chamber of the Estates, while for their meetings of recreation the King has given them tha use of a large saloon in his palace of La Solitude. As if all this wasnotenonghto turn theheadsof thegood, quiet Stnttgarters, a troupe of 20 picked French actors and actresses has been engaged to keep up the pleasurable excitement; they arrived yesterday, and are to give their first performance to-night. Of all these various categories of visitors to this place the churchmen as usual have got the best of the accommodation, for they came the first, and are also here en pays de connaissance, the Kirchentag having on a former occasion been held in this capital. The shifts that the natives are put to in providing accommodation are at times comical enough; thus the enquiry-office for the members of the Kirchentag was yesterday, immediately after office hours, converted (before my eyes) into a sleeping-roomi for an English visitor, with the rapidity of a pantomime trick. For the first time within the memory of the oldest inhabitant of Stuttgart, time has acquired a value in this region of " slow-coaches " in consequence of this concentration of interesting events; and nevertheless, yesterday, at the last station before entering the town, the railway officials dawdled away " one whole hour by Shrewsbury clock," for no earthly discoverable reason, and then a goods train that was coming out of the town profited by theopportunity to spill four of its waggons off its own line on to ours, and so we had to wait another half hour till one of the lines was cleared. But not a single Geriman made the slightest attempt at a grumble; hafing ascertained that "it would probably last another hour" they amiably lit their pipes and proceeded at once to rejoice in the beautiful scenery around and the cool shade from which they could look Oult on the lovely sunlit panorama stretched out before them. Tlle AloMitlur of yesterday has the following:- " STUTTGART, SiP-v. 2G, 345 Pi. "On his arrival at Stuttgart the Emperor was 'welcomed in the warmest manner by the popula- -" His Majesty was received at the railway station the King, the Prince Royal, and the Princes of his famoily. " A few moments after his arrival at the Palace His Majesty received the visit of the Emperor of Russia. There was a family dinner party at the Palace.

" The Emperor Napoleon and the King returned to the Palace at Stuttgart at 11 o'clock.

THE LATE XUBDER IN LEIGH WOODS NEAR BRISTOL. On Saturday morning the pilsoner, John Wiliam Beale, who is charged with the murder of Charlotte Pugsley, was brought up under remand at the Bourton Union workhouse. The presiding magistrates were the Rev. Fenry Morehouse (Chairman), Colonel Burrowes, Messrs. Shorland, Mordaunt, and R. Morehouse, jun. The Chairman inquired whether the prisoner was prepared with any solicitor, or whether he wished to be defended ? The prisoner said, he should wish to be defended, and that he rather expected his father would have come over from Bath that morning. Inspector Norris stated, that he had seen the prisonez's father early that morning, and he said he would send some one over. The CQsARsria? said, it was proposed that day to prove what could not be contradicted. They would take formal evidence of the body of a woman having been found who had been murdered by somebody; of the medical man who would prove the cause of death ; and of the Daventry wit. nesses, who would state what they saw and what they did at Daventry. He (the rev. chairman) apprehended that no solicitor or counsel in the world would attempt to disprove these facts. If at the next meeting any profesdonal gentleman appeared for the prisoner, he world of course be informed of all that was stated to-day, so that he might be prepared to meet the case in the event of its being thought sufficiently strong to warrant the magistrates in sending the prisoner for trial. George Worts, under-gamekeeper to Mr. William Miles, ALP., of Leigh-court, was then sworn, and deposed to finding the body of the deceased, in the manner which has been before describad, on the afternoon of Frlday, the 11th of September. He at once gave information to Superin. tendent Jones, of the Ashton police, who returned with him to the spot, and whom he assisted in removing the body to the New Inn, Rownham. The CHArntMAN.-Prisoner, have you any question which you wish to put to this witnes ? Prisoner.-No; not respecting that. The CHAIRINsAX.-Re states nothing respecting you, but that the woman was found murdered on Friday and that the body was not there on the previous Thursday. Prisoner.-I have witnesses to show that I was not there -The CHAMRMAN.-We will hear your witnesses afterwards; but now you may ask this witness any question. Prisoner.-I have nothing to say. The CRAAr3L.uN repeated that if any solicitor shoald hereafter appear for the defence he would have the opportunity of cross-examiz;'ng all the vitnesses, except the Daventry ones, who would be returning home, but he would be furnished with copies of their depositions so as to be able to shape his case in the event of the prisoner being sent for trial. Mr. J. R. Lucas, surgeon of Long Ashton, repeatedin substarce the evidence given by jhim at the inquest as to the appearances of the body of the deceased woman and the cause of death. A claspknife found in the prisoner's room by Inspector Sansome, of the Northampton police, was exhibited to Mr. Lucas, who stated his belief that such an instrument would have inflicted the wounds found on the throat of the deceased. The CILnMMA2X.-Will yoU give your attention to a stain which appears at the end of the blade of the knife? Mr. Lucas.-I have examined the blade, and near the handle I see a very slight stain upon it, which I believe to be produced by blood. There are some other marks upon the kni£e, which axe evidently rust, but not upon the large blade. Prisoner.-I think I could prove by three witnesses that I left the knife on my pantry shelf when I left for BristoL Mr. Norris has a penknife which I carried in my pocket when I came home. My wife could prove that I left that knife behind, but she is no witness. I believe. The CRAinmgt.xy-That is your statement; hereafter we will draw yoar 6ttention to what you have now said, which is that the knife, produced by Inspector Sausome, you left in your pantry when you came away to Bristol. Your wife will be the only person whom we cannot hear. Prisoner.-That is what I thought, Sir. But the groom has seen it as well in my pantry. I have used it as a corkscrew in drawing the corks of pale ale. The CnA1mLA.N'.-Mr. Lucas does not prove the knife to be yours; he only says that It is capable of inflicting such wounds as he has described. He does not say that it did Inflict them, for of course the knife might have been 500 miles off. He does not evea go so far as to say that it is human bload upon it. Have you any question which you wish to put to him? Prisoner.-No. John Norris deposed,-I am an inspector of police at Bath. I went to Daventry, in Northamptonshire, on Thursday last, and took the prisoner into custody on a charge of wilful maurder. I had no warraat. I didnot think it necessary. I searched his person, and found 12s. and a few halfpence on him, and the keys which opened a cupboard in his bedroom. In that cupboard I found a bunch of four keys, three large and one small. I found a large box in his bedroom, whiceh one of these keys opened, and in the cellar under the house two other boxes, which I opened with twvo other keys. From a description which I had with me of the three boxes which had been taken away by Charlotte Pugsley when she left Fresbford I was quite satisfied that these wexe the boxes which had been so deseribed. I was told that the prisoner had left with Charlotte Puagley. In his coat in the pantry I found a pistol loaded with ball, which Iproduce. (The pistol vas a smaLl percuesion pocket ~iztoL) I have seen a similar pistol in the possession of *,ansome, an officer of Daventry. The pistol I produce was unloaded about haLf an hour ago in the presencoe of the magistrates.'I produce the ballet which I took out of it. 1I have compared the bullet with a bullet in the possession of Sansome. They are identicaL The CHAmmAN (to the prisoner).-Have you any question which you wish to Put to this witness? Prisoner.-I should li-e to know what Mr. Norris is going to do with the watch and the money he took from me. The CRAiTSmK (to Norrds).-What is the amount of money you have received and believe belongs to the prisoner? Norris.-About 12s. Prisoner.-It is 17s. I think. Norris.-It was In a purse, which I produce. There are t2s, in one end and seven farthings and a gold ring in the other. The CEcA.wnsr..-I should like to see that ring. Norris produced the ring, which was one corresponding with the rig described to have been worn by Beale-a signet ring weitha red stone. Witness continued.-There were three pence loose in the prisoners pocket, and he had about him a silver watch and chain, three guncaps, a quantity of gun. wadding, a box of cigar lights, a knife, a lead pencil and a snare. The CRI , AN (to the prisoner).-The watch, I suppose, is the only thing you want? Prisoner. -Yes, and the money I should like to have. The CnA1RLsx£.-I should hope that more money would be found. rP;isoner (to Norris.)-When you found that pistol upoa sne it was not recently charged, and the one which wa oa the mantelshelf had been discharged. Norris.-I don't know; I am not a judge of firearms. The CnRAY (to Norris).-Are you able to say how long that pistol bad been loaded? N orris.-I am not. The cap appears corroded, it is not bright or new now. Ihave other property which I found in the pantry, but I am not prepared to go into the matter at present. If more time is allowed I shall be prepared to go more fully into the evidence. Prisoner.-Will you allow me, if you please, your worslhp, to have my watch and money ? The CHtArRsAe. -I don't see that it would be the elightest advantage to you to make an order for their delivery, because, if we did, and Norris were to give them into your hands at this moment, the next mom-nt it would be the duty of our inspector, Jones, to take possession of them. At p resent we can make no order about the watch and things; hut supposing you should be sent for trial yOU wiU haee an opportunity of applying to Her Majesty's judges to get them given up. Were the money to be 12t. Instead of 12g. vwe might order itto be given up to enable you to prepare your defence. Samlel Sansome, Inspector of Northampton Police, de. posed.-I went on Thursday last with Norris and another policeman to apprehend the prisoner. We took him at Badbey-house, tl'e residence of Captain Watkins, in whose sece he lived. I found a pistol, which I prodace, in the prisoner's bedroom. (This was a fellow pistol to the one produced by the last witness.) It was lying on the platedhest in the prisoner's bedroom. I had seen it several times before in his posseesion, and I knew it to be his property. It was unloaded, hut had been discharged, and the cap was left on the nipple as it is now. I also found a powder-flask, which I produce, containing a socL-et for holding bullets and caps. There were U bullets in it. (It may be stated here that these bullets have been compared with the one extracted from the head of the murdered woman, and are found to correspond, with the exception that those in the flask are about two grains heavier.) I found this flask standing on the dressing-table in 'the prisoner's bedroom; I had seen the flask in his possession before. I found a key oil the dressing-table which fits this pistol, and also the one produced by Norris. About three weeks or a month ago I had some conversation with the prisoner about his pistols, and he told me that he had given 30s. or 21. for them and the powder-flask all complete. I also found the knife before produced lying on the shelf of the pantry dOwDStairS. The prisoner said, the witness was quite right in what he had stated; it was 30s. he told him he had given for the pistois. Joseph Payne, a policeman of Daventry, who assisted Norris and Sansome in the apprehension .of Beale, pro. duced ashirt found in a beg in the prisoner's bedroom, on the left wristband of which there were some slight marks of blood. Simneon Branscombe.-I am gamekeeper and gardener to Captain Watkins, of Badbey House; the prisoner was butler there. I remember his going away on the 6th of September. I heard him say that he was going home to see his father, who bad. met with an accident, and that his sister was supposed to be dead or was dead, and-he was going to see abont it. This was on Saturday, the 5th, as he left on Sunday, the 6th. He returned on Saturday, the 12th. He came to Badboy-house near upon 9 o'clock in the evening. Alter his return a person at Daventry brought up three boxes, which were delivered at the door. I aseated the prisoner in carrying two of them down to the coUar. He asked sne to help him with them, and I did so. He said that the boxes belonged to his sister, who was dead. (The boxes were here produced. They corresponded exactly 'ith those described as having been talcen away by Charlotte Pugaley when she left Freshford.) These are the three boxes I saw. I put a mark on two of them, by which I can swear to them. The CHAmYMA (to the prisoner4-Have you any question you wish to put to the gamekeeper ? Prisoner (to B antscombe.)-I think you made a little mistake about the boxes. If you recollect, Simeon, I said nothing about my sister. I merely said I brought those boxes fe om home. The CmuAIBmL%w.-Put It in the shape of a question to him. Do you recollect whether I did not say I brought tl ose boxes from Bristol ? Prisoner.-That is what I said. I did not say they beI nged to my sister. I asked him to help me with them into the cellar. Branscombe.-He might have said, and I have no doubt he did say, that he brought the boxes from BristoL Prisoner.-Did I say they belonged to my sister ? Branscombe.-Yes, you did, certainly. In reply to further questions by the prisoner Branscombe stated that the blood-stain on the wristband of the shirt might havebeencausedby the prisoner handlinga dead rabbit, which he had seen him doing on that day week. Witness had no recollection of ever having heard the prisoner discharge his pistols. The prisoner was then formally remanded till Friday next. Mr. Hughes, superintendent of the Bath police, received a letter on Friday evening from Mr. R. W. Carpenter, actuary of the Bath Savings Bank, stating that the deceased Charlotte Pugsley was a depositor in that hank, and that on Saturday, the 5th inst., she withdrew 51. 9s. Sd, being the 'whole amount then standing to her credit. The nnissing bonnet and cape of the deceased have not yet been discovered.
NATIONAL STANDARD THEA TB. The engagement of Mr. and Mrs. Sims Reeves at this eastern establishment terminated on Saturday and the Standard is now devoted to legitimatetrragedy, the principal performers being Mr. James Anderson and Miss 3lswortby, who will make their first appearance since their return from their successful tour in the UIited States. During his engagement Mr. Sims Reeves confined himself to strictly Englsh music, no doubt considering that by this plau he would appeal more strongly to the sympathies of his public. Htenry Bertram, Captain Macheath, Hawthorn (in Lore in a VTilage) are the principal characters in bis repertory, and alcogether he made himself a thoroughly national figure. With his acting he took remarkable psins, and, while he cha?mcd his audience by his irresistible ballads, he often surprised them into con. vulsons of laughter by some histrionic eccentricity. One of his best feats was the performance of Blue Peter in Black. cycd Susan, a personage whose sole function is to sing the ballad from which Mr. Jerrold took the name of his celebrated drama, and, of course, his execution of that good old song was as perfect as could be desired. The revival of Black-cyed Susan was also rendered remarkable by the appearance of Mr. John Douglass in the character of Wilam. Owving to the pressure of managerial b'siness that gentlemsu rarely appears upon the stage, but his merits as an actor are well known. in Oriental parts, where his unfrequent manifestations of himself are bailed as welcome events. Completely the reverse of Mr. T. P. Cooke's William, Mr. Douglass's impersonation of the British tar is, nevertheless, a highly characteristic and genial nerformance. It was the mission of Mr. Cooke to give a hig degree of ideality to the nautical ptofession; his type is founded on a poetical view of the class he depicts, and William, with all his fea habits, bis 'bacco-bo, and his lingo, still floats as a sort of refined being above the mob of sailors by whom he is surrounded, and who are supposed to be his equals in soecl rank. Mr. Douglass, on the otherband refrainsfrom all subliming processes, and, takinghis sailorjust as he finds him, allows him to retain all his primitive rough. nmess. The position thus aesumnedhe consistently maintains, and thus his performance is quitesatisfactory,notwithstadd. lag its utter diversity from the interpretation of the veteran artist with whom the character is usually associated.
I THE 70TH RGIMENT NATIVE INFATR Y. TO TlHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have just read in your paper of the 9th inst. a letter eigned "A Bengal Officer," in which he states, in the latter part of paragraph 3,- "W While the army under Lord Gough was encamped at Cbillianwallah, after the battle of the 13th of January, 1849, it was found necessary to clear away some of the dense jungle that grew in front of the camp. The sappers were not nmnerons enough for this dutv, and native infantry regiments were ordered to assist. I saw one regiment (if my tecollection serves me it was the ''loyal' 70th Native Infantry) in the moat inaolent and mutinous manner on parade refuse to take the billhools offered to them. I believe their officers talked them into doing their duty, but I did not hear of any Sepoy being called to account for disobedience of orders.' The 70th Native Infantry Regiment was not paraded to receive the billhooks, as the writer of the above appears to think, but two companies, Nos. f5 and 8, were told off for the duty-in thensual manner. The former, under my com. mand, marched to the artillery park, where the sappers tools were kept, and thence to the jungle in front of the mound where the monument now stands to clear away the brushwood, &c. The 8th company, under a brother officer, followed as a covering party, and I most positively affirm that the men not only took the billhooks withont a murmur, but did their work cheerfully, and some of them laughingly remarked that they would get their firewood for nothing. At the period alluded to the regiment was commanded by Major (now Colonel) J. K. I'Cansland, who is one of the last men to allow " insolent" and " mutinous" conduct in his corps to pass unpunished. I am only now recovering from a severe illness, which will account for my not having seen or replied to the letter in question earlier. Will you kindly give this a place in your valuable paper, and oblige Yours trnlv. J. A. WRIGHT. Brevet Captain, 70th Regiment Native Infantry. 2, Maxine Cottages, Ratings, Sept. 25.

RAILWAY INTELLrGENBc. LMTDAWn almvpw AvpuP The hsaf-yearly meeting of this Oompany was held on Thuday in Dablin* r J. Ennie, XP. in the chair. The secreta res i the report, an abstrct of which hag aed in 2/ne rima. hue Cr , in movn the adoption of the report, sated that the GreAt Southbrn and Western efAIsw Com. pan had obtained an Act in the lat session of Parlament ant orizn an extenion line westwazd from Tallamore to Atblone. This would enable them to compete with the Midland Compeny for the throngh traffic betweea Athlone and Dahlin; but the entire of that through traffic did not exo%d 20,0001. a-year. Supposing that at eguAl rates the Groat Sonthern and Western Company should obtain half the existing trffic, he doubted whether it woul& be worth the cost at which they would be enabled to obtain ilt. The Midland Company had not mueh to fear from that oompetition, as a oertain portion of the traffic could not be taken from them. They had entered into an altianse with parties who were constructing a railway from Athlone to Castlereagh, and who intended to extend it from the latter plae to Castlebar, to Westport, and to Ballina. When the line was completed It would be worked by the Midland Great Wostern Company, whowould have the control of the traffic. He thought, at all events, that the companyceuld notbe deprived of its through trafflc to and from Gslway. The wozks on the proposed extension ine from Athlone to Sligo would soon be in operation, and by that means tbey would secure the traffic to and from that district. Looking at their position from every point of view, he thought the, bad no reason to despair of the result. He was sorry to say that the oompetition betwvee the Great Southern sud West.rn Company and the Midland Grat Western Company nas proooeding vigorously; the rates had been reduoed very low; yet it was a state of things which, under the circumstances, they must ex,pect. It did not, however, affect their dividend, and although they might deplore the existence of the competitiontheyhadnothing tofearfromit. (Hear hear.) A long discussion ensued, in the course of which the report was received and adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, was declared. T e retiring directors, Sir T. O'Brien, Mr. X. Perry, Mr. T. Richardson, Mr. J. Sterling. and Mr. J. Watson, were reelected. It was agreed to ad 300 to the former grant to the family of the za r G. Little, who was muzdered whie bet-g the company's cashier. The remuneration otb arar s increased to z a and the proceedings concluded wilth a vt ftaL otec rx and directors, the chairm ST. ANDRBWS. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts on capital account to 31st of July lst amouxted to 25, 800u., and the expenditure to 25,7271., leaving a baance of 72, The revnurle accounts for the half-year endlng 31st of JuV ehoewed that L812L had been received, and 1,03S. expended, including 5334 milerate to the Edinburgh and Dundee Company, leaving a baLanco of 7761. Out of this Is deducted 991. Interes on debentures, 4524 dividend to sharehdders, leaving a surplus of 2241., one half of which, or 1121., is payable to the Einburgh and Dundee Company, under the working agreement. The remaining 112 is carried to a sinking fund, which now amounts to 4641. The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 51 per cent. per annum less income-tax, and they conclude lFY expre- g their confidence in at least a continuanoe of the prospernty of the affairs of the company. SCOTTISH NORTHIEASTERN. The half-yesrly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Aberdeen, Mr. Stirling in the chair. The report, which has appeared in The Times, was held as rea The CAiRntAN congratuated the shareholders on the present piositlon and prospects of the company. Compared with the corresponding half-year of 1856 it would be seen that they had realized 34001. more in receipts at 504 less in expendiure, but when tbey exammed the details it would be found that they had expended 2,50014 more in taxes, new stock, repairs, &c., than in the previous half-year, and thus their position was yet more improved.ll this increase of receipts, too, had been realized not only without any deterioration of plant, but with its being made more valuable, for the iroctors had felt it to be their duty to maintain the efficiency of the stock, whatever might become of the dividend. Daring the half-year they harn u48,00 miles less than they had run during the corresponding half-yer, in which, habelieved, lay the secret of their savings, The general resalts bad been such that they could pay a quarter per cenW more dividend to the Midland shareholders; not had to pay 6001. towards the cost of the Perth station, and some other contingencies, they would have paid a quarter per cent. more. The traffic general had increaed, and npon the whole they might look forwardwith hope to a prosperous time. (Cheers.) The chairman then moved a series of resolutions approving the report and its recommendations. Mr. I'GA&vr felt satisfied that the directors had done their best, and he was especially glad to see that while they had been able to present an improvcd balance-sheet they had been able to keep the property of the shareholders in a state of the greatest efficiency, and for his own part he would rather be without a dividend than have one at the expense of any saving of e nxpenditure that might risk the safety of their line. (ApplaLuse) The Cr n'eu , in answer to a question, said, the reference made in the report to the cattle traffic, from which increased receipta had been expected, pointed to an arrangement that had been entered into with the Steam Navigation ompa; but he was sorry to say that, taking both means of transit into accoun it was found that the cattle trafTIc to London had of late fallen off 60 per cent. The resoluSions wrere then passed. PERTH AND DUNElD. The report of the directors of this company states that the revenue from traffic for the past half-year stows an increase, over the half-year ending Blst Janua last, of 1011., while the revenue from trafic from 7th Apr11 to 31st July, 1857, contrasts most favourably with the same period last year-the Inreae this year being 280L The=blancof revenue account applicable for dividend is3 1,6111., from which the directors retommend a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, to be declared on the sabscribed capital of the company amounting to 65,875. ; the dividend will amount to 1,3171., and leave a balance of 2941., for the next half-year's account. The dividend 'will be payable on and after 20th of October next. TRAFFIC RETURNS. MIles Ps- Me,.

TaE ArPEun To TilE MIYN LLrlzss.-We see by the statement of TVic Times that not a little indignation has been kindled behind the counters of Oxford-street and Regent-street at the proposal to exalt the shopboy into the soldier, and metanorphose the haberdasher into tho hero. Elverybody perhaps knows best what he is fittest for, and it is nonsense to talk of fighting and glory to the youth whose ambition is apprenticeship, and who feels that within him which prompts iim to measure gingham as distinctly as young Norval felt the inspirations of valour. "Bt I had beard of rinds and I longed to foaow to her oeDh somn Eboppiplng fair." We must be content to take things as they are, and, among other things, those manikins who feel themselves meot in their element at feeble and almost degrading occunpations, from whieli girls of any pluck are ront to revolt. Potently do we believe that there are many thousand young women in England at this moment with a spirit above soft goods, and more mettle than to tie themselves for life to the counter of a tape-shop. Maidens take to these weak callmgs of neeessity; It is only young men who embrace them of choice, and aspire to the yard as if it was a rifle or a sword. In this terrible Indian struggle who would be surprised were a Boedioea to start out of tho outraged womanhood of England, and with Cawnpore for the warwhoop, call upon aU brave girls in the land to follow her to the Ganges? We should much sooner undertake to raise a battalion of our oountrywomen at this moment than a single corpavy worth their salt out of the man-millinery population of London. A man-milliner l Was there ever a more absurd combination of ideas? If it takes nineo tailors to compose a man, it must surely take 99 men-milliners Consequently, by the rule of three, The Time must be wrong m supposing it posxible to raisee seh a corpa. It would take exactly 99,000 of them to make a regiment, and then how should we ever manage to transport them and their band-boxes to India? We know what It is to have the transport of one woman with her baggage to provide for. Besides, you must tnsex such recruits before you can make soldiers of them. Men are much more unsexed by foUow. in feminine pursits than women are by occasionally g manly uhties upon them. 1AVinia might have roaped as wel as gleaned, yet have remained the fair ILviniA. An Amazon is a woman stilL Yonr man-milliner is a man only in name, the addition of the milliner being suffiCient of Itself to cancel the manhood. If we do the millinery host a wrong in what we have said, they have a very simple way to defend themselves. If the measuring of tape and muslin has left any nith in their arms, it their hearts are anything more than haUs of ootton, there is nothing wsier than to show It. She Times has sounded the trumpet. Let Ragent-street revolt. Let Oxford-street rise in general reboelUon against a system that reduces men to something which it is a libel on women to compare them with. Let them turn their yards Into ramrods, and make flags and banners of their scarfs and handkerchiefs. Lot them for once not mind their business. The ro r business for the yonth and strengh of England at ts onr is in the fields of flindostan. e pledge ourselves that out of mere goodnature the same number of young women, now oat of work, and some of them out of bread, wldl be found to take the vacated posts behind the counters; and, however attractive in the eyes of their fair customers each tall haberdmhor and bold draper may now deem himself, we promis him that he will attract still more female admiration, not to say respect, as a man and a soldier, than he ever did or Lever will as millner and shopboy.-Exanzincr.

POLICE. MANSION-HOUSE.-Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor, madO the following application to the LORD MAYOR :-I have to make an application to your Lordship under a very salutary' Act of Parliament, entitled " An Act to amend the law respecting defamatory words and libel," the third section of which sys, "and be it enacted that if any person shall publiah,orthreaten to publish,anylibel uponanyotherperson, or shall directly or indirectly threaten to print or publish, or shall directly or indirectly propose to abstain from printing or publishing, or shall directly or indirectly offer to preventthe printing or publishing, of any matter or thing touching any other person with intent to extort any money,or ecurityr for money, or any valuable thing from such or any other per. son," he shall be liablo to the penalties of the Act of Parliament. The application I now n ilke to yonr Lordship is for a summons against a person named ThomasRose, and it is at the instanoe of one of youLr own brethren, Alderman idir R. W. Carden. Sir B W. Carden, as your Lordship is aware, is the next in rotation for the office of Lord Mayor of this great city, and he has determined that if he should be chosen by his brother citizens to fill the chair which your Lordship so worthily oocupies he vill be so withott any favour or affection or reward that shall have been given or offered to any person, exoept that favour and Lffection to, which he is justly entitled from the love and respect of his fellow.cttizen3 Au nattempt has been made to extort from Sir R, W. Carden money for the purposeof bringing voters to. vote for him, first, of course, to hold up their hands for him in the GuildhaU of this city. That attempt has been made by message to two or three different personsthat is to say, it has been stated to one person that a sum of 4,000L. had been subscribed to get up an opposition to Sir P. W. Carden. That statement ws made to a person through whomit was known that the information would find its way to Sir R. W. Carden. To another person it was mentioned that the sum of 1,500C has been raised, aud that no less a sum than that could prevent the opposltion; indeed, that it wonld cost 1,6001. to do it. To another person the sum of 2,0001 has been stated to have been received' but to one gentleman, Mr. Millard, who has frequentiy filled very important offices il in this city, as tuder-sberiff, 150l. was mentioned xs the sum that would induce Mr Rose to forego any oppo. sition to the election of Sir BI W. Carden. Upon that Mr. Millard was requested to see Sir R, W. Carden. Mr. Millard did see Sir R W. Carden, and Sir B. W. Csrden aS once repudiated the thing. Ie said, " If I am to come ila as Lord Mayor for the ensuing year, I will come in upon honourable principles or I will not oome in at alU. I wvil not give a fraction." This was communicated to Mr. Bose, who, upon receiving that information, requested Mr. Millard again to see the alderman. Mr. MilUard deolinedl doing so, and referred him to the alderman's deputy. Mr. ose goes to the deputy, to whom he mentions the same sort; of thing. Re has two interviews with him, in one of which he takes from his pocket a manucript paper, and says, " I have Just discovered that ihis rs to be printed tomorrow night." The deputy looked at the paper, read it, and sstdtohim, "How didyou get this'" "Why" said Rose, "Itvwas intbehandsof myprinter; Iwentin and sawit; it was putlntomy hands to read, nd having read It I put it into my pocket I offended the pnter exceesively by doing so; but I would not give it him bac}, and I brought it to you.' Now, it so happens that that very paper has found7its way into a verylarge placard which has been posted about this city, and it found its wvay on to walls of the city on the very night w hen Mr. Roa sa Mr. Rebbel, Sir B.. W. Carden's deputy. Rose said before laysing the deputy, "If Alderman Carden wwil not do this, this shall be published to-night ;" and it was published ia the follov ing words- "Who are we to h%ve for LoDrdM5ar ? Fellow-citlzea. tbis jes nowwith u. t?,e lmpo,tans netIo. Shall it be 8ir Robert VaLte, COsdml No. Why? Beca.e his evIdence on the inquiry iS'o the Swnda openngl of vuSbliaehueswas meettoffdemi to oueves a, men manfittohcchetmagirtrete of the gpnteet city intbewold! On the 2th Inst. show hiu sue tbo empire that you do not thlnk fo. but that by your voice in Oome,ouhall yomr act will be to sej'e t himm choose one ot his lentern who Is better entitled to onr rnSnder'cc -A HAstor ftx~ This has been published very freely all through the dity_ Although it is a libel, still the libel itself is of so scurnlous a character, that but for the threats which were used I should have advised Sir B. W. Carden-indeed, I do not think it would have required any advice from me-to have taken no notice of it. But when it is accompanied br threats of publication unless a sum of money is given to buy the services of this person named Rose (I ought to mention that he is no relation whatever to th, worthy alderman of that name, who is honoued by those vho know him), then it becomes a very serious and grave offenoe, which, as I have already told your Lordship, has been provided for by a most salutary Act of Parliament. I have none of the gentlemen present to whom these proposbls were made, but Sir B W. Carden Is here, and he will state, if necessary, that these proposals were made to him, and that he believes in the trath of the statements made to' him. I propose, if your Lordship shall grant my applica. tion, to summon the different parties to whnm thesom statements have been made in order that the case may be heard beforo you on any day which you may appoint. The LOBD MAYoR. - This is a very similar case to one in which the Ban- of London recently proceeded against;. two persons. I have read tho clause in the Act, and I feeL that if what you state is oorrect, I can have no difficulty in gnmting a summons Mr. }umphreys-If these things are allowed to go on i am afraid, my Lord Mayor, that corraption will be thtt only thing known in the city of London. The LORD MAYoR.-It is understood that this is not an electioneering matter. You really some seriously to ask me for a summons with A distinct understauding that yora will have witnesses to prove what you have taNted. Wr. Humphreys.-I am so told by Sir L W. Carden. The LORD MAYOR.-I do not liklo the Mansion.house justice-reom to be made the plaoe for settling electionee;ing schemes; but if such proceedings as yout have mentioned go on tbey must be stopped. Mr. Humphreys.-I asure you that you have not &. greater enemy to those electioneering schemes than thoh person who now addresses you. I would not maL-e an application for a summons or anything else unlee I was determined to carry it out to the end. The LORD MLisox.-Upon that assurance I will grant; the:summons. I think it better not to have It heard till the election is over. ir. Humphreys.-If your Lordship pleases The LORD MAYoR. -Do you think it is a matter that presses? Mr. Humphreys.-Oh, no; I do not think it presses. The summons was issued, and the case will ba heard oR Friay neat,
