On tho motion that the Lords' amendments to this Bill be agreed to, MIr. iPOOXER rose to move as an amendment that tha followiing words, added in the Lords' committee at the end of clause4§ be disagreed from: " A'd thereupon the said sum of 243,923L 5s. Sd. shall be considered to have been duly divided among all claoses of shareholders of the company." The hon. member, after detailing the circumstanoes con. nected 2with the Redpath frauds, which had lod to the introductio, of the present Bill into Parliament, observed that to the ,Bill s it had been introduced no objection was taken iby te shareholders, nd that the words ta which Fhey weie now opposed had been inserted in the committee of the House of Lords after the preamble had been eed to, and during that confusion which alwaystook place ahiong the parties when the clauses were being settledHe co4ended that the terms upon which the preference shareholders held their shares were that they should receive a dividend of 5 per cent. in perpetuity, to be pald anually, and that they were entitled to take out of the profits of the year 5 ier cent. per annum upon the capital which theyhad invested before any one else could receive anything. The effect of the words which he proposed to leave out would be to thro* the preference -shareholders upon a half-yearly divisioni of dividend instead of upon a yearly aivision, ana to hoid them as having received, although in fact they had not received it, 21. 10s. per cent. out of the half-yeaes revenue up to December last, thus cutting down their claims against the revenue of the whole year from June to June to 21. 0s. per cent. He had no doubt they would be told that the Attorney-General had sanctioned the proposed arrangement, but he (Bfr. Spooner) looked upon the opinioni of the Attorney-General as being very much qualified by the expression In it that the arrangement was to be carried out according to the existing rules which dotermined the mutual relations between the parties. Every one knew that a legal opinion depended very much upon the nature of the case submitted, and he should like to know whether the attention of the Attorney-General had been drawn to the fact that the holders of these shares were to be entitled to 5 per oent. "per annum" interest, or preference dividend in perpetuity. (Hear, hear.) It was to those words "per annum" that he weshed more particularly to call the attention of the House, and he maintained that if the directors chose, for the sake of convenience, to make uptheir accounts and to pay dividends half-yearly, that could in no way affect the rights of the preference shareholders to their 5 percent. per annum out of the profits of tho year. At all events, if there were any doubts as to the rights of the preference shareholders, he urged that those doubts should be decided by a court of law, and that It was not for that House to interfere to settle the rlghts of contending parties when the ordinary tribualis of the cunetry were open to them and were infinitely be tter calculated for the purpose than that House could by possi- Mr. TURNER supported the amendment, considering that a principle of commercial honour was involved in the question, which the House was bound to maintain. When a railway company was not able out of the funds subscribed by the shareholders to complete its undertaldng, the directors either borrowed money on debentures or raised it in the shape of preference sharos, as had been done in this case. The persons who lent their money upon that undertalkng were content with a beneficial interest of 5 per cent., although the ordinary shareholders might receive a much larger amount of interest. In the first instance the debenture holders received the amount which they were-entitled to upon what they had lent on a mortgage of the line and the preference shareholders came after them with an equitable claim to receive the amount which had been guaranteed to them in the event of there being property to that amount. This was not the first time that a railway company had attempted to carry a measure of this kind, but he tought that It was the duty of the House to oppose a system which heo believed to be antagonistic to the principles of commercialhonoar. (Hiear, hear.) Mfr. NEWDEGTE should vote for the amendment, because he did not think that the House ought to preclude any persons who considered that their rights were affected from appeaing to a court of law. At the same time, he thought that tho principle of the non-liability of preference shareholders adm tted of great qualification, because there could be no doubt that they had a voice In tho election of directors and in the transaction of all the ordinary business of the company. Mdr. BAIt eE, as chairman of the committee to which the petition of the preference shareholders had been referred, stated that the case submitted to them was this,whether the sum of money required to make up the deficiencies occasioned by Refipath's frauds should be paid out of the capital or out of the dividends that were then due, those dividends being sufficient at the time to pay the whole sum. The committee decided that, the frauds being in the nature of a pveat calamity which had occurred to the Pompany, it was fair, as the company was in some respects responsible for the milsfortune which had occurred, that the loss ought to have been paid out of the dividends then due Since that period, however, a different state of things had aisen. it second half-year's dividend had become due, And consequently the directors now had a whole year's dividend in hand. The case having been thus altered, the words whic ist was now proposed to strike out had been inserted by the Lords to provide for the new state of circumstances, because if the second dividend had not become due the Bill as it stood, when it left the House of Commons, would have effected te purpose which the committee had in view- and he believed he might state that the committee of that iHouse, as well as of the House of Lords, were unanimous in the decision at which they arrived. He should support the alteration made by the House of Lords, because he conceived it carried out what was the original intention of the committee of the House of Commons. Sir J. GRATAM.-Did the preference shareholders appear by counsel before the committee ? Mr. H. BAILLIE.-Yes Mr. HEADLAM entirely concurred in what had fallen from the hon. members for North Warwickshire and Manchester. There was not one word in the preamble of the Bill to justify the House interfering in any manner between different classes of shareholders. (Hear, hear.) Whatever were the rights of the preference shareholders, Parliament should not Interfere to alter them. (Hear, hear.) When the Bill first came before the House only a half-year's dividend was In hand but the preference shareholders maintained that they had a right Ito take the income of the whole Tear, and that they should be applied first in payment of the losses incurred in the year; secondly, in payment of the dividends on the preference shares; and, thirdly, in pay. ment of the dividends of the ordinary shareholders. Whether they were right or wrong in that conclusion was not a point for the House to decide, as it might thereby alter the relative position of the shareholders. (Hear, hear. Mtr. J. MWART thought that the Lords' amendment, if carried, would inflict a serious blow on the comnmercial honour of the country, (Cheers.) It had always been con- sidered that the preference shareholders were iot liable to any losses occasioned by frauds committed on the company with which they wero connected, and the proposed leislation was calculated to depreciate the value of all prefereucs ares. (Hear. hear.) Mr. W. BROWN said that it was only equity and justioe, when persons had lent their money to a compny in order to enable the ordinary shareholders to carry oat the scheme and Mave the property, perhaps, under a compact that they should receive a certain amount of interest, that that comn Fact shold befulfiLed. (Hear hear.) It would be a great ablow to conimercishonourto attempt to doanything against the rights of the preferenceshareholders. (HIear, hear.) Mr E. DENISON, as chairman of the Great Northern JIailway Company, desired to say a few words on the question before the House- He understood that the committee of the House of Lords added the words now under discusdon for the express purpose of maling that clear which had been previously expressed by the committee of theo ouse of Comr mons; for it was Intimated that the Bill, in the term. in which it left the Commons, might occasion litigation. The whole question relative to the preference shareholders was discussed before the committee of the House of Commons, who unanimously came to the conclusion that thepreference shareholders had made out no case for protection and when the Bill went to the Lords the committee in that Hose, after hearing both parties, came to the conclusion that the Bil of the Commons ought to pass. The original intention was to capitalize the amount with which the company had been fraudulently charged, but the chairman of the Lords' committee insisted on the loes being paid outof theearningg of the company, and tho consequence was that under the advice of the Attorney-General a Bill was brought in and passed through the House of Commons, directing that the losses by frauds should be dealt with by the earnings of the company for the half-year. The words now under discuseion were onlyaddedbecausae it wasdoubtful whether theorigInl phiaseology would cary out the Intentions ofthe committee of the Commons. The matter was discussed In the Hounse of Lords, and on a division there were 43to 7 in favour of the retention of the words in question. There appeared to be some misunderstanding about the rights of preference shareholders; but it was admitted on al hands that they were not the same as guaranteed shareholders; yet if, because they did not get a full dividend in 1856, they should be entitled to put their hands upon the earings of 1857, as was contende in order to make up the previous de. ficieney, they would not be preference dholders, but guaranteed shareholders. There was no doubt that preferenoo shareholders wero to a great extent partners in the concern, took part in all the discussions concerning it, and had as much influence as the other shareholders. Whatwould boe the consequenoe i the Lords' amendment were rejected, and the matter carried to a court of law? The result would oe that nelther the preference shareholders nor any other shareholders could Se paid any dividend at all, for the hands of the directors of the company would then be entirely tied op. He did not make that statement unadvisedly, and he thought the best course for the House to adopt was to agree to the amendment of the Lords. Mr. LOWE said the Bill was introduced for the purpose of rendering valid certain spurious stock, and of purchasing and extingaishing that stock, so as to reduce the whole amount of the compn's stock within the limit authorized by Act of Parliament. The committees of both Houses of Parliament, however, went beyond the original purpose of the Bill, thinking that the duty was imposed on them ef regulating by whom the loss occasioned by the spurious stock should be borne. They had decided that question by depriving the preference shareholders of the preference to which they were entitled, and the matter now for considera tion was whether they acted rightly in so deciding. If this matter hbad come regularly before the committees of the two Houses he should not be so rash as to impugn their decision, but when the committees went beyond their jurisdiction it was competent for hon. members to discuss whether the comrdttees bad acted rightly. It was certain that no difference of opinion existed between the committee of the House of Lords and the committee of the House of Commons, tho former only desiring to carry out in more explicit langua.ethe intention of the latter. After the best con, sideration, it appeared to him that the committees laboured under an error in enterlng on the question at all, for the nuestioc as to how far the ordinary or the preference sharehoIders were liable for the loss incurred was one for a court of law, andthecommitteesoughtnottohavedeprivedindividuaj3 of their rights merely to remedy an inconvenience. (Hear, hear.) By disagreeing from the amendrment of the Lords the Rouse would prejudice nothing, but would leave the parties to settle the matter before the legitimate tribunals of the country. (Hear, hear.) It was stated that no dividend couldbeopaid ifthe Lords' amendment were disaeed from but he believed it would be competent for the lords to in. troduce a clause, on the Bil being sent back to them, to obviate any Inconvenience of that kind. He thought the House would do wisely under the circumstances to reject the Lords' amendment. Mr. FITZROY could not quite agree In what had fallen from his right hon. friend. The point at issue was whether the amendment sent down from the House of Lords altered the scope and Durport of the Bill as agreed to by the committees of both Houses. He maintained that it did not, for the same objecUon as wasnowraisedto theamendment of the Lords was discussed before the committee of the Commons. The Attorney-General and another learned counsel had expressed their opinion that it was jus' and right that the losses occasioned to the company by the frauds and forgeriea of Leopold Red th should be borne by all classes and ranks of the sharehol ers. He (lJr. Fitzroy) thought it was evi. dent that the preference shareholders must have been fully aware of the habilities likely to be cast upon them by the Bill. He abstained from entering into any discussion as to the merits or demerits of the measure, and would merely say that the object of the amendment to which exception was now taken wvs simply to render clear the meaning and intentions of the committees of both Houses of Parliamenit. Mr. SPOONER was understood to say, in explanation, that the?,reference shareholders had objected to the additiontothe clause, which in its original form left their righlts as they previously stood, subject to an appeal to a couLrt of law. Mr. BREICOE thought the House and the preference shareholders in the Great Northern Railway Company were much in,debted to the right hon. gentleman (br. Lowe) for his clear statement (hear, hear), which would enable hon members to arrive at a wise and just conclusion on this sub ject. Tho question was one of great importance and they should be carefal not to establish a precedent wihich might shake the confidence of the public in the value of guaranteed and preference shares. That House was not committed to the clale in the form in which it had been sent down from the Hou,e of Lords, and he hoped the House of Commons wrould not consent to become the more registrars of the oplnions of the other House. He wvould therefore ,give his ,pport to the amendment of the hon. member for North Mr. P. W. EARTIN was anderstood to say that the questloni raised during this debate had been discussed by the committee of that House, who were of opinion that the matter did not come within their jurisdiction. The galleries were then cleared for a division, but Mr. DENISON said he would not give the House the trouble of dividing, and The nmotion of Mr. SroowmE for disagreeing from the Lords' amendment was accordingly adopted. ; PUBIdO CHAlITES BILL. Mr. HARDOiASTLE, Inmovingthesecondreadingof this Bill, said its principal object was to diminish the expense of appointing new trustees for charities which derived their revenues from laud, and also to afford trastees of such charities a cheap mode of obtainingincorporation. It appeared from the report of the Charity Commissioners that at the time their inquiies were instituted there were between 5,000 O0Q0. and 6,000,0001. invested for charitable purposes in publc stocks; upwards of 1,000,0001. was invested in different forms of mortgage; revenues amounting to oO,0001. a-year were derived from rent-charges, and there were about 440,000 acres of laud belonging to these charities, producing at the time the report was presented an aunual rental of 900,000,., but which now probably yielded more than 1,000,0001. a-year. This large qxantity of land was, how. ever, divided into almost infinfitesimal fragments, and was distributed among from 25,000 to 30,000 charities, whose average rental did not amount to more than 401., the revenue of mnayhundreds not exceeding 40s. New trustees could only be apponted by deed, which involved a cost of about 101., andlte conseq.uence was that when such appointments took pla4e the charities were subjected to great loss. As a necessary result of this state of things trustees were appointed Very irregularly, and sometimes not at all, and consequently in many cases the charities lapsed. The Bill he was submitting to the House had been framed with a viewr of remedyingthese evils. It proposed the appointment of a registrsr-general of public charities with an office in Loxndon, vhich it might probably be convenient to attach to the, existing registrarship of births, deaths, and marri3ge$. I also proposed that the existing trastees of publiQ charities should have the opportunity of depositin their deeds with such registrar upon payment of a small fee, not exceeding 31., and that by re mation and the rayment of the fee the trustees should be incor- poraree, hUS securing the benefits of perpetual succession. It was fn~ther proposed that the fee for the registration of any new trustee should be lO0 The Bill might be objected to on the ground that it would involve a demand upon the public pulse, but from calculations which had been made he was satisfibdthat the registration office would be self-support. lag. It might also be objected that by creating numerous groups of petty corporations they would destroy the individua resonsibility of trustees. He s*now. ledged that the Bil as it stood was open to that objection, but if the House allowed it to go into committee he would propose a clause with the view of continuing the individual responsibility of trustees after incorporation. Mr. EjtANS seconded the motion, observing that he thought there could be no objection to tha principle of the Bill, which was intended to remedy an admitted eviL Sir J. TROLLOPE objected to the Bill on the ground that it would create a new Government board under the control of th Treasury, observingthatsuchaproposaought, in his opiion, to emanate directly from the Government. The hon. gentleman who moved the second reading had asked the sRonse to allow the Bill to go into committee, in order that axy objections might be considered at that stage, but he (Sir J. Trolope) thought the sense of the House ought to be taken upon the second reading of a measure which involved a principle of so much Importance. This Bill, he mnst observe, entirely ignored the existence of a, large and expensive administrative department-the Charity Commissioners, who cost t'he country somethinglike 16,0001 a-year. The hon. gentleman, however, proposed to incorporate the trustees of these charities, and to establish a new and most expensive board, consisting of a registrar-general, a deputy registrar, and a staff ot clerks who must, of course, bo provided with the necessary offices and fire-proof buildings. He (Sir J. Trollope) thought the establishment of such a department was most objectionable. The promoters of the Bill seemed to have over. looked the fact that when trustees became incapacitated for acting the representative of tho survivor had the oppor- tunity of creating a new body of rustees byfeollinent mna enrolment in the Court of Chancery at a very trifng ex. pense.

Mr. ASSEY thought the objection urged agaathis meaure to which the hon. gentleman(Mr.Hardcastle), who moved it, had referred was one of great weIght,-amely, that by Inoorporatiag these smali trusts they would go far to destroy the responsibility of individual trustees, and to diminish their mnterest in the proper administration of the funds under their control. The hon. gentleman proposed to bring forward in committee an amendment to meet this objection; but the principle of the Bill was the inorpora. tion of trustees, and ir the hon. gentleman abandoned tt principlee must bo prepared to givo up the whole BilL He (k Mr ssey) thought that at his period of the session it would only be wasting time to go into eommittee. He saw no necessity for the inoorporation of these smaUl trusts. His hon. friend (Mr. Hardeastle) zaid his object was to prevent these trusts from expiring, and fancied he achievedthat objectofconvertingthemintecorporatlon,but he (Mr. 3assey) arw no provision in the Bill which would secure to the ewly-constitated corporations that vitality which the hon. gentleman wished to attach to them. Then, again, the hon. gentleman proposed, by the payment of a small fee of I10 on the appointment of each new truste, to raise a fund which be hoped would defiay the ooet of the machinery necessary for carrying out the object Of his Bill; but he (Mr. wmssey) contended that auch a system of petty fees would be altogether Inadequate for that uro and that the resuQlt would beta the consolidated l, ao"lready overburdened, wouldhaveeventualytobear the cost, lie denied, too, that Parliaiment had been nagli. gent of the interess of those charitable bodies. A few years a o thism su'biect was (deiberately discused in all its parts in that Hou, and the result was an Act of Parliament embodying the Charitable Trasts commi Ion. That Act had only been in operation a feW years, but he was not aware that the expectations of those who framed it had been dis. appointed (Hear, hear.) The application of that Act was especially direted to tho obscure and small trusts which had escaped public observation and run a risk of falling into desuetude, and very mainute provisions wore asedo for their government.

(Hear, bear.) That was a course of dealing fatal to the prospects of Irelad, and detrimental to the sapbty of tha whole empire. Accordng to the census of 1851 there were 6,552,000 human beings in Ireland; noW there wem not 6,000,000 (hear, hear), and in two or three yers henco they mright be futher reduced by another mileon. That did not augurdell for the strength of the ootatry. It was an un,a doubted fact that it was from Ireland that the army of thiq country must always be recruted, but by an act of irEerby they drove the -people from the country, and so withered the right arm which was ready to save her in the hour of danger. (Eear, hear.) Hee would eaestly call on the hon. gentleman the r eretary for eland to take this m£atter into fis serious consideration during the reces, and to place a Bill on the table next sesion which after full discussilon, by the House, mught be pased for te great benefit of the people of Irelaid. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BAGWELL said, it was a ruistm that the great strength of England lay in her manufactures~, buLt thos,e manufactures could no be carried on in the face of a competitionL with the -whole world without cheap labour, and if the supply of labour went on derecasing as it had done for some yeas psat in Ireland our manu. facturers would find teomselves driven out of more markets thantheyhad already beenby the competition with whioh they had to contend.

It was true that of late there hadabean a general decrease ofcrimeI among the Iish people, and in some districts it Wh di. appeared altogether; but if a question of this hind was allowed toremain from. year to year unsettled, the bad feeihngs of the people, which were sleeping but not dead, might be roused at any moment under a bAd hreTorthe presse of soe othe r c aform of distress. tiaremoecently of dp theIrihmembeshad been retmmred on Theasolemon pledgeto thbeircoasttuet that they would sup. post tha t mea s he a of this kind and henca lledight the G over n. nient to give them, atast the eginningof theet session, a Mr. GREER expressed his regret that the Bil was to be withdrawn, and that the Government had not themselves taken up the subject. It was a very serious grievance which had been pressing on Ireland for A great nuntber of years; and, uitil it was removed, he did not think the people could go forward in that career of prosrity which wasonowgopeningbeforecathem.gItcwasmdesirable.that the and whaet wo the IrishGpeoplend of the reh eresn tatiest be found few persons possessing a large stake in Ireland.

(Heir, Htr. HeATCEcELL said he could confirm the opinion which Prevaied in Irdeand that the only way ofbringing this ques. tion to a satisfactory conclusion was by its being taken up mcn dealt with by the Government of the day, and that it would never be advanced one step so long as it was pressed upon the House by any private member, whatever might be his weight or the number of his followers. When the deputation waited upon the noble lord at the head of the Government there was no dissenting voice among the geun. tlemen composing it with respect to the principle of the Bill brought in by M. Moore; and, though there were some observations madle at thu interview in which he (Mrx. Hatcher) could not concur, the principle Of affording some certaity, of tenure to the oecupier of the soil and some seurty with regard to improvements was recognized and aaonates by every one present. Whex that was the state of feeling on the subject he -ould not understand why the Government should hesitate to bring forward a masr based onrthat principle. Bllr H. HERBERT declined to give any distinct pledge on tbh part ofathe Government. He recommended Irishtmem. bers to boe mderate in their demands on behalf of the tenants, and assured them that the Government would give that serious consideration to the subject which its im. portance required. Mr. STAFFORD said, this was the only subject upon which the Government had not promised to bring rorward a Bil next session. He inferred they had no intention to bring forward any measure at all, audit was admitted that it was impossible for a private member to introducea mneasure with any chanceA of suce-.

(Her.) The order was then discharged. BURIAL ACTS AIIXNDMENT BILL. The House then went into committee on this Bill, Mr. MASSEY moved the addition of a clauso providing that bodies should not be removed from burial-grounds save under faculty, without the license of the Secretary of State. The clause was agreed to. Mr. MASSEY moved another now clause, enabling in. cumbents to bury in burial.gronnds certified by the Sere. tary of State, prior to the consecration thereof. It was in. tended, he sai, to meet tho difficulties which had arisen in consequence of a right rev, prelate refusing to consecrate a burial-ground until provision was made for the convey. anc of the incumbent to and from the ground, and of thesera betweenthe onsecrated and unconsecated Mr. GLADSTONE appealed to the hon. gentleman not to press a claus which was open to tho gravest objeetlons. in almost every instance the difficulties had been adjusted by the good Eense of the parties. The case in which the ishop had appeared unreasonable with respect to the character of the se ation was before the courts of law, and if the courts of could not deal with it efficlently the Gxovernmont would have no difficulty in framing a provli sion by which the controversy might be brought to a oon. ciusiou. 1e granted that it was a serious matter, where the bishop wa~ determied to disobey the law, and refused to consecrate rntil provision was made for carrying the in. cumbent tO and fro between his reddenco and the bur=lsj

THE VOYAGE TO IDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES. Sir,-In the debate on Monday night ia the House of Commons on the question of despatching troops to India, Admiral Walcott is reported to have sad that the quickest passge to India he had ever heard of was made by the Medusa frigate, which made the pusage out in 87 day &o,, but that was an unparalleled circumstance." The gallant Admiral can know very little of the ships which nowsail to India, or he would never have commnitte himself to such a statement. One of Mr. Green's ships, the Nile, then oommanded by Captain Nisbet, of which I was the ehief officer, made the pasge to India in 72 daLys; and in four oonsecutive voyages, from l850 to 1854, averagedA 77 days out; and t1his magnifi. cent ship stiAA continrues to maJce the same pasMgs Other ships constantly mnake the pasaea to IndiaAr hi I&s thnan87 days duringthe season, so that the featof the Medusa frige cannot certainly be called " nparallee ciroum- I am, Sir, your obedient servant, a, :L %,UV4N(5Xj, vommaaaor1i, me veraon
TELEGRAPHIC CO 'JUIVfATION WITR INDIA. The following letter hao beeti sent at hiis request to Lord Palmerston; as embodying the views of a deputation wlhich waited upon him some days ,aince *-oor, ~ smedy " My; Lord,-I have the hononi 'by your Lordships' desire, to submit in writing the representation which we were permitted to make at a persorkal conference this morning relatire to the establishment of ab electric telegraphic commuinication between England, Indi2, and China, to be eventually extended to Australia. " The association xepresented by the deputation was the first to propound the line of telegraph to India by the Red Sea; but, although the proposal was favourably entertained at the India-house, it did not receive sueh encouragement from the Treasury as to induqe them to carry it out, aad they therefore contented themselves with deputing ax agent to Constantinople to obtainl thonecessaiy firmans. "While the agent was proqecuting the negotiation, another project was started by another party for the establishment or a telegraphic line to India, down the Valley of the Euphrates, and met with favour at the Treasury. A conditional promise was made of a subvention of 12.0001. a- year, and the Hon. the Couart of Directorslikewvseaided the scheme by engaging to continue the line at their own ex,ense, by laying a submirine cable from the head of the P ursian Glf to Kurrachee. " The agent retarned at the beginning of the present year from Constantinolpe with PJl the concessions necessary for the construction of the line .from Alexandria to India, but the association found aa'sinuperable obstacle 'in their path in the intermediatesubveton of the }uphrates line. If within the Ilst twelve months since this subvention was conceded any substantive progress had been made in that line, or if the difficulties of construction had been proved of less amrount, the ievessity of the present applicationi might in reason have been questioned - but no such prcgress appears to have been made, ani no opposing obstacle removed, while the neessity of immediate tele. a eommunication has beenrenderedpainfully apparent vy he late, disastrous tidings from aur Eastem empire... "The Euphrates Valley line must neer PAN through near y 1,000 mnles of country inhabited by barba rous tribes, always at feud with each other, and beyondthe control of their nominal rulers. In a communication recently publisbed in Thec 2'imer it Is stated that the Cou-ncil of Tanzimat at Constantinople has refused t-usanction a telegraph through tthat- vaey on the pound that the TurishGovrnmaitwasunable to protest It. At the same time the establishment of a police by foreigners for its maintenance would not be per. mitted by the Sublime Porte. It has hem suggested that some of the lnfiuenitial'tzibes might bIeInduced topro. toot it, in consideration of a yearly payment, btut a communication with ourdependences and colonies in-the East is a mtter of too great i1mportanco to be left dependent on the caprice or cupidity of savages. There appears, therefore, little, if any, hope tIat a telegraphio line can be estbrlohed through llesopoaiawt any chance of permanent securityuntilt eprojec edrailway hbeen completed.' " Under these circumstancea the Red .Sea Association deem it important to the national interests again to submit their plas to Her Majesty's Government. T They have obtained ltha tecessry concessions of I the Turkish and Egyptian authorities for the establshment of a telegraph tbrough Egypt and down the Red Sea. They propoe now tolay asubrirind cable-.which wll bo under their own control, and comprtively free from interruption -from Suez to A4en. with intermediato sations at Cosseir, Jnddah, and Camaran; and from Aden to Kurrachee, vith three intertnediate stations at Ras Shurmab, the Rooria Mooria Islands, now a British possession, and Rae i. Had, iu the territory of our ancient ally, the Imaum of Muscat. The line from the Dardanellesto Alexandria, foi which a concession has been obtained from thePorte, wlrl be constructed without delay, either by this association singly or in conjunction with an Austrian company. "The members of this association are prepared to comlete the telegraph from Alexandrla to Indla in a period of from eight to 15 months from the time when the asdsta'nce of Government Is secured and the preliminaryarrange. ments are made. As the distance from Suez to Aden is lees than half the distance from Suez to India, the line to Aden might be completed within i ver short period, and that ort isonly a weeles saIl fro ma ombay ; the cost of the line is stimated at 800,OO001,-tbat is, at the rate of 1601. per mile upon 5,000 miles. This is considered as the mazz-. iunus expense, but, as t'he 3most heav Item of expnditure consists in the submarine cable, itVis not improbiable that the experiments now In progress with two different descriptions of cable-the one from England to America, the other from England to Denmark-may Issue in reduoing the cost below the present estimate. "The substantial assistance of Government Is essential to the commencement of operations, as it would be Impossible without a guaranteo to raise, the necessary capital. The asociation would therefore venture to ask of Her Ma. jesty's-Government and of the East India Company a gnarantee of 6 per cent., or 48,000L a-year, to commence from the completion of the Jine and the transmission of the first through message, with the understanding that all Government despatches shall have preference as to time, and be conveyed at the same rate as prlvate messages, and that all receipts, from whatever source, sll be appropriated to satisfythe guarantee, which will cease and determine as soon as the amonnt has been entirely i-quidated. " The present proposal is made inno spirit of hostility to the Euphrates Valley line, but simply from a conviction that circumstances will not justify the ponement of a telegraphic communication with India till the railway down the Euphrates Valley bas ben oompleted, And thab the Bed Sea,line offers the permanent advantages of Inmediato con struchon and permanent freedom from interruption; but the establishiment of a telegraph by which daily communi. cation can be held with India in a few hours apPkardsto be amatter of such vital importance that even the conI joint encouragement of both llnes-that of the Euphrates and that of the Red Sea-may not appear altogether unworthy the consideration of Her MajesWs Government' "Ibeg permission to enclose a map, which exhibits the course laid down by this association.

RLECTION COMMITTEES. The General Committee of T1Eclwons yesterday norainated the following committee:- Hu1rNmG3Do (Couy ).-SirT3. Tohnstone, Mr. H. Paul], Mr. T. ?3L Weguelin, Mr. W. W. Wynne, and Mr. J. M,L Cobbett (chairmian). W -M'UH At the re-assembling of the Committee yesterday morning, Mr. TAsxs sald, that the counsel for the sitting raember would confine the evidence which they should offer to the case to which their attention ha beea directed by the roeso lution of the committee passd on the previous day. The Rev. W. Smith, a Congregationial minister at Wey. mouth, stated that he was at Mr. Campbell's on the evening of Thursday, the 26th of March. Russell, Mr. Campbell's servant, came in, and his master asked him if he had cashed the cheok for 101. which he had given him In the morning. Russell said thiat'he had not cashed it himself, but had given It to Vile. Mr. Campbell said that this was not in accordance with his instructions, which were that Russell Crom hismocetad.p acemipbon stthed thablhe. ha. Campr. stood that the check hadabeen given to Vile. Mr. JT. H. Stocqueler, a friend of Mr. Campbell, who was also .1resent on this noccason, was examined, andl gave sub.. stantialy the same account of this occurrence. He saw Mr. Campbell give Russell the check just after breakfAst, and heard him say, IIGo and get this cheek changed, ay for your marketings, or for your smnall expenses, andl biln me she change." Mr. Sto equeler further stated that, having on the 26th of March visited Mr. Campbell, he saw in his room two pairs of sllppers which Mr. Campbell said had been left by a poor man, but didanot fit himi. They fitte-d witness, and so he purchased the two pairs for 1l, Mr Campbell, the sitting member, was then called by Mr. ,T3Aa%S and stated that when he went to contest Weymouth he took a furnishied house caled the Belvidere. He engaged a man named Russell, an inhabitant of Weymouth and an elector, but who did not vote for him, as a servant. Among other persons he canxvassed a shoeeaker named Thomas Vile, who promised to voteofor him. Having for otten his slippers he asked RusseUlto get him apair. On te follow. ing day Russell introduced a shoemaker with a pair of boots andL three pairs of ali er.He purhased one pair of slippers. Vile asked IOs.fo themn, but he ad him ouly 10s.

The boots were taken away to besteched, and he saw no more of them. On the 26th of March he handed Russell a check for 101. that he maight change itand bring witnessthe money. He did not give It to him to be given to Vile. Hle never said anything to that person about his vote in connexion with the purchase of these slippers. On the polling day Vile went to witness' house and told him that hie had been offered 51. by Mr. Devenish to vote for Mr. Butt. Witness told him that he mnig,ht do as he pleased; he was certain of alargo mnaorlty and wanted no bribed vote. Hatton never said anything to witness about having seen Simmonds. During the election witness paid the gr-eatest respect to the Corrapt Practices Act, andl impressed upon his agent to do the same. In cross-examination, Mr. Campbell stated that he never befre ad liper let a hs husetobe sold to any of his frindswh miht vat tem.Hemight alow such a thin tobe one,eve alhoug hewasnotelectioneering.

THE PUBLI4 HEALTI. (Fromb the B gistrar-Gneral's Wee3dy Return.) The-deaths registere4 in London In the week that ended n Saturday, July 18, exhibit an increase on thosG of nine Ireviousweeks. Thenumber Ul1,06l, of which 550 ara reaths of males and 51l those of females. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average umber of doaths in the weeks eorresponding with last week was 1,028. But as the .daths of last week occurred in an increased population the average, to admit of comparison, mnst be raised proportionally to theincrease, ia Which case it wiU becomel,1l0. From these statementsitm Ybeinferre that tbe present coA. ditlon of the public health Is atjeast as good as is usual at this period of the year. The deaths from diarrhesa, which in the three previotus weeks were 33, 65, and 133, rose last woek o 150., The increase which this disease now shows is th6ifbora not so great asthat which appeared in thd preeding retu±l. The cases of ast week occarred iu propoxtiosns considerably uiiiform in the several divisions of the metropolis, though it will be seen in comparing aub-districts that in many no cases are returned, while in others the numbers vary froml 1 to6. None occurred in tho St. Olave district, and onlyone lu that of Wandsworth. Of the 150 deaths from diarracea 140 occurzed to children, all of-whom, with the exception-of 33, were infantsles than a year old,. Besides these the deaths of 14 persons (all children Ixoept two) are referred to cholera, this complaint being4described in most instances in the returns as * cholertca'diairhcea, "infantile cholera," &c. In all fatal cused of -eholera It ig d6strablethatthe durationx of the previous stag-o'f dlgrrhoa, when it can, be ascertained, should be stated by the medical attendant on his certficate. Only one death from smallpox was registered last weekl but it Is stated by the registrar of Somers-town that In Little Clarendon-street In his sb*district there are 2t cases of illness from the diseaee. O 21 deaths from measles 10 occurred in theeat districts. Four persons died of carbuncle. Two widows died at the advanuced ages of 96 and 98 year. Iast week the births of 860 boys and 826 girls, ia all 1,686 children, were registeredin London. In the 10 correspond. Ing weeks of the years 1847-56 the average ninmbei was 1,379. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week -was 29-998 inches. On four days the mean teading was above 30 inches. The highest reading was 3019 inches on Monday. The mean tenmperature of the week was 68 deg., which is 6-3 deg. above the average of the same week In 43 years. The mean dally temperature was above the avOkAge throghbut the week, and on Wednwsday it wag 721' deg., which is 11 deog. above the average. The highest temperature in the treek occurred on that day, Snd was 89'7 deg. The lowest occotred on Friday, and was 50 9; the range of the week was therefore 38'8 dog. The mean dew-point tomperature was 57 -0 deg., and the difference between this and the meantemp6ratuie of the air was U deg. On Wednesday the highest tqeperature in the sun was 1156 deg., the hl,hest$point attained in the week. The mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 67-3 deg. The wind was for the most pirt in the south-west. There was rain to the amount of 015 In. It fell at a late hour on Thursday and early on the following morning.
THE PUBLIO SOHOOL MATCHES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The letter of " Paterfamilias" in 2%e Times of yesterday expressez the feelings of many publia schoolmen. It is net a light cause whioh ean Justify the discontinuance of such reunions as the public school matches, the significance of which your correspondent by no means exaggerates. We have a right to askwhether there ris no ehance of their being revived. It is absurd to argue that erieket ahould be practised for its own sake, and that the stimulus of antagoniam is unnecessary. It needs but a slight knowledge of English character, so nobly developed in our public school life, to see that the combative spirit is the very sOUl of those gamnes which are the marvel o' more thin-skinned nations. Nor Will any 'other matches supply the place of these. Men may fancy and prove that a contest with,' the Marylebone" must be the great event of the season to those who have their spurs to win; but boys hnow that it is not so, and that nothing qui.kens the pulse and braces the nerves like the sight of youthful rivals. Cricket, to be sura, wll go 6n at Eton and Harrow as long as the birch rod and Latin Gramnmar themaelves; ut It most certainly will lose the healthy enthudasm which Is the best part of it if it be restricted to matches between " the tWo halves of the alphabet," or to stately encounters with metropolitan clubs-no aore like the "Lord's' t:baathc" than arevielw ia like a battle. - What,then, are the objections to the old-fasIoued plan; and (supposing these to be insuperable) what new plan can be suggested? Of the manydifficultleB that have been urged I know of none that deserve serious consideration exeept -the moral one. On this point Idiffer from " Paterfamilias." He must see; if he be what his name implies, the temptations of a residence with that accommodating relative, " an uncle" (who generally has a goodnatured butler and allows a latch-key), and the facility with Which boys supposed to be intent on the match would find other means of amusing themselves. It does not follow that because parents in general are willing to run these risks-a fact by no means proved-the school authorities, on whose sanction the match virtuaI= depends, and who have to contend with the miseief (if any) thereby engendered, can relieve themselves of all responsibility. I cannot understand the readiness with which the Harrow authorities, who maintain that there is the utmost risk to discipline in the meeting of the two elevens In a quiet village patrolled by masters, would turn loose, not the elevens only, who may be supposed to have acquired some selfcontrol, but the school, on the dissipations of London. But, whatever the evils of this kind (and they deserve to be carefully ascertained and fairly weighed), many of them would vanish if the match were played at Lord's during the half-year. This would save the convenience of Winchester, the Harrow loss of &lat, and the scruples of Eton, and would make a grateful break in a tedious school time. But I must insist that the value of the matches consists in their influence on the energies of the schools, and by no means depends on the multitudinous waving of handerchiefo or the cheers of aristocratic backers. The interests of the Eton and Harrow boys ought not to be sacrificed to those of old Etonians and Harrovians. If it ihould be found impossible to agree upon a place withina fashionable eveningdrive, this Is no reason why the schools should lose their annual match. If the delicate organization of Harrow is not proof against the rude influx of Etonians, let it be played on some neutral ground. The 'University boat race at Henley is little inferior in interest to that rowed on London waters, and the lovers of cricket would have little to regret if (as there is reason to hope) permission were graciously given to use the Home Park at Windsor for the moat interesting event of the cricketing year. At all events, let the question be openly entertained. If we all desire the restoration of the matches, why then let them be restored. Do not let petty jealousies or diplomatic misunderstandings rob us of a most precious means of invigorating and uniting our great public schools. It is time to cry out. In a few years the memory of these matches will be dimmed, and prescription, which is now so strongly in our favour, will be turned against us. If the head masters (each of whom is believed by the rival school to be the great obstacle) would refute the calumny by reconsidering the question in a spirit of cordiality, the preliminaries would soon be settled, and we should before long forget this unfortunate break in our Olympiads. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant. AN WXOMAN. L.OntllX, JULY Z1.

The half-yearly zepor* and atement of acounts, of which an abstract has *ppeared in 1ic Times, were taken s rea4l. Tho CsanaXrAi, in mOving the adoption of the report, referred to the report published by the directhrs of the London and North.Western Company in repIy to the charges made against them by this company, and as to the teremnation of the worldng geement between the two companies. Re pointed out in some detail that' the reply was simply a denial, unsupported by that-show of evidence which might have been expected from parties against whom snch allegations were made. No denial could set asde the palpable fcts that an Act of Parliament hAd been obtained, that a railway was laid down; and that trains were rzihing over itin this company's ownpeculiardiict. (Eear,he=r) Hle then read a correspondence that had taken place smbsequently Yetween Captain Huish and M. T.

(Applause.) As the directors of thisi company 'were conscioas of having acted only in a etraightforward and hoaourable manner, he had desired Mr. Ross (the seretary) to write to the ecrtary of the Lonclon nd-worthWesternoCompiay. they should be happ to exchange lists of sae oldr in theo respective un drtakings, i oraer that the whole of the facts rmght be laid before every iedividuami in each company. .Whether the offer would be accptead or not-lie dic& not know.

He at the same time wished to express his personal sense of Mr. Stewarts blgh character and honour, and ho hoped thxt no0 Interruption of kindly feeling might take place between thein on account of their mutual porformance of puiblc dtties. Hemust, however, continue to protest against the alleged mnaluuer, as ex parte, ancl as niot conveying fairly and correctly what iad transpired at meetings, both of which oncopteda very long thie and theaproceedings of ach of which it was now Suhtt uvfairly to condmue Into a dozen sentences, written inavhe interest of one of the partiesholy, oaid after the meetins took plac He then gave an illustration of what hewishd.toconvy, 'by calling attention to statements in pages 5 and 7 of the London and North.

Mr.7immrssaidlhe had no doubt of theagreeent with the Great Northern proving very beneficial; ut he would be Sl to hear some statement as to the results that mgaht be expected. The CtromeA explaines that under the late agrweeent with the London sad North-Western the gaam teed receipts of this company in 1861 would have been fe5m per oeek, without any of the London and Lancashire taffic whaehver, and he was glad to say that their receipts this woek hadbeero told68; thaothe shareholders might judge for Theraceipt of London and Mfancheter traffic would not comnmenee untit the st of Augusta next. He might as well mention that this company'a prospecta were so wel thought of that he had rcelved an offer from rtsponfsible parties guaranteeing a divlend of 3 per centeon the old stock (sApplause); but, of course, he could not honourably enter- tain such a proosal whie they wereo uner agreement with the London an North.Wesein. Mr. FmcroN suggetedthat some steps should be taken at once to bring about that peaearble di on of traffi with the London and North-sWesedn whIch nmus ultimately take place, and thu avoid a useae waste of money by both companies. (Hear, hear.) Mr. W.&THM, MJ'., thought Mlr. Fenuton had no occason to be under any apprehension whatever that if a competition took plsac the Sheffield compan would lose mu byi it. As he had taken some little pains to explain, at the recent special meeting, he hadlittle fear of any competition theIi ondon, and North-Westr couald sot on toot, or ain combination they might endeavour to bring about ; anad to show the temper in which the directors of the compAny wished to meet this question he maight mention M FnAt lS.w, instruted, and va O*h Y carrieve out the isthmtion, to prvpose to thae if and North-Wester Compny thati, instead of going Into competition ifinredistely on the cormpnation of the agreement 'with them at the beguining of Jn, they shoud have a trmce tin the ist of August He proposed that toCaptaln Huish, and, after a, corresodne wich he would not say much aboZut, his pro )otlon w t ulti nately aepted.Bt, although thefpropoeldonwir s aocepted ho (rl. Watkln) wa sutounded to find that inr tho London an Northx-Western timetable for the ast of .Thy without any notice to their (the SheoeLd) or the Grth Western boards, they ha put onpan entirely new fast trasin fro Manchester to o ndon. He remonstrated, of course and they were told that this was a train required for the doteloprmnet of their sammer traffic. However, although there ouldt havo been justfication if they (the Sheffiaed) had choean to terminate the trce, and although they (the Sheffield Compay) were the parties to suffer, and the London and No'h-Western we the parties to gain by It, they had prsi erved tbh truce, and intended to do so til the sto obtn A uts rWith regaa t to rates, farme and speeds, and all such elements of competition, Mr. Seymour Clarke had, on their joint behalf, proposed thti they should mare same fares, the same arrngmaent.s and comrmuniEat openly to the London and North-Western what theyd roposed to do in return for their saying what they would do; but, although they saidl they had n o ohjection to working at equal rates-and he should be very much surprised if they had, seeing it was so much to their advantage (a laugh and "hear, hear")-they had doclened to rtellohemnwhat their arrangements were, and they were totally unaware at what speed they intendea to travel, or ,what they intended to do on the lst of August. He was sorry to say that he could see loomingrin the dgtisnce a course of that sortmof petty obstruction which a large company could occasionally practise with regard to a mal one,in reference to the oecupation of the joint statfon at Manchester. He was afraid they were not disposed to maeet this question In the spirit with which Mr. Penton suggested, and th at they would have some trouble with them at Alanchester. The only thing that would console him for it was this, that if they did attempt any course of obstruction it would be a justification for the directors of this company asking Parliament for those maeasurestondefLne the ri ght of each company in the joint occupation Which he beiegved to be necessary. (Hear, hear.) It was net the desire of the Sheffield directors to $punge into rec'kless competition - all. they sought was their fair share of traffic, by fair am1 legitimate mneans. They would not obstruct or irritate the London and North-Western, but he was bound to say that company ha not shown a similar spirit of conciliation, and the shareholders must observe this -they must not tie the hands of their exeontive, because if they found they ha to deal with peoDplewho relied and acteclupon this company's forbearance, confiding that it would never inflict the punisment always in its power, its positionwould be indlee unmfortunate, and it wouldl be unable to obtain its rights in that final settlement which must come about.. If any friend of the North-Western could induce In them a better sUtat of maind they would find beth at the Great Northern And at the Sheffield board every dis. position for a fair and honourable settlement. (Applause.) Mr. E. BucnLry thought theILondon and North-~Western had p roved a very strang ally to this company, in making a new lin side byside wit hone oflitsimportant canals. (HeaLr, hear.) The business having terminatedl, Mr. C. Sxvyn moved, and Mr. Wmrxus (of Liverpool) seconded, a vote of confidence in the directors, and approval of their recent proceedings, which was unanimously agreed to. NqORTH STAF8'ORDSffRE. Tho report of the directors of this company states that the receipts on the railway for passengers, horses, and mails amnounted for the half-year ending the 30th of June last to 43,2181, being 6,0861. over the corresponding periodl of 185; the recipts for goods and live stock amounted to 79,0591., showing an increase of 2D,8544.over thesame period of 1855; and rents to 1,632?., or 2781. over 185; makding the total receipts 123,9101., against 110,1921. in the first half ofl1856, and 96,6911.inflrst half of 1855, showingan increase of27,2191.overthelatter. The reeeipts onthe cgnalfordues amountedatoB5,801., being anincreasoof 17,082 over these of the first half of 1855; flor freights, to 13t,2991., being an increas of 32,9671.; for Waes of limestone, 5,2641.; bein an increase ; of 5521. for miscellaneoous ariles, 1,8681.,beidng an_tincrease of 173.; mwMaki he to-al re- ceipta on tne can; 74,2831. for tho half]year endlngthe 30th of Jne, against 72,9521. in 1856, and 52,5261. in the same period of 1855, showing an increaso of 21,7561. Tho increase is mainly to be attributed to the local trade, the through traffic for passengers and goods on the ranliwy being systematically withheld and impeded. The steady progress of revenue from tho independent resources of the company more than bears out the caloulations upon which the decision of Mr. Stephenson was founded in settling the traffirs arran eonents between the London and North. Western and North Staffordshiro Comupanios. It states that the London and North-Western doclined to fulfil their engagement in the first half of 1855, and that the reoeipts for the past six months are equal to tho maxmum amount whichl that company undertook to seCure to the North Staffordshire Company. The claims of the oompany for arrears under this aranngement are stll in liti; tion, but there is every reason to hope that the cao willo deciaed before the end of the year. The necessary arrangements for commencing the works on the Biddulph branch will be completed within a few months. Exclusive of the larg claims against the London and North-Western Company, e net profits of the half-year enable the directors to recommend a dividend at the rato of 4 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 3,2431. The captl account of the railway shows that 4,010,6301. had been received, and 3,990,6491. expended, leaving a balance of 19,9811. Tho capitl expendod on the canal amounts to 1,170,0001., makng together 5,180,631?. expended. The rallway revenue for the half-year ending the 30th of -une amounted to 123,910Z., and the expenses to 63,9661., lavkln 59,9261. The canal revenue amounted to 74,283M, and tho expeses to 28.4781., leavlng 45,8051, The nct revenue for the half-year frora the railway and canal, added to 8,1751. from the London and North-Wastern Company amoucis to 113,9061., from whick i deductd quo;60Q for U;te on loans, 29,2501, for canal preference dividend wad 566527 for ordinary dividend, leaving with other ma(ters a alnce of 3,2l., which the LOCOunts Zattc is oxclusivo of 67,9H. due Lw the London and llozth'Western to the 31st at December, 1856. CRYSTAL P ACE. The diretors of this compauy have issued a supplemental report, in whicl thetate that at the annual mneting Leld on tho 30th of Junelast the appointment of a copuittec of 21 proprietors was carried bY a maajority, en 'a show of hacds, against a motion for receiving the dlreeters' report and that the meeting was abruptly terminated. Who diroctors, it appears did not oppoec the appointment of th4 committee, And have givenx every facdity to their in. qulries. The directors express their dinppolutment that the- proceedings ot the meeting were characterized by xo much disorder on the part of a small secton of the sareholdersas to prevent explanations beinggivenatthe time, and the mesures which tho directors were prepAred to submit to the maeeting beiog put forrd. Tey stat their belief that unleus an unaistakeable expresmon of opinion on the part of the large bodv of proprietors be given, discountenancing such a course of proceedings in fature, the affairs of the company cannot be sitisfactorily carried on. It appears to the board to be essential that the maunement should be in the hands of an executive cormanding the entire confidence of the great bulk of the shareholders; and unless the present board shall be found to possesm that confi. dence, the directors consider the wilD be oonsultlng the bea interests of the company by resigning their positions, and maling way for others wrho ray pose a lrger share of the confidenco of the general body of shareholders. The result of a year's working is now before tho shareholders, together with an accurate balinoe sheet, and these coi.- tam the elements for arriving at a just appreiation of the position of the company. There ought, therefore, to be no room for exaggerated viows of success on the one hand or of needless dppression on the other. It Wll be seen that the directors have succeeded in raising a large revenue for the comphny In the last year; but, *a the otherhand, the expenses incurred inattainzngthis object have been Tery heavy, and the directors do not attempt to conol their dippointment that the result hs not proved xmore beneficial. At the same time it will be een~ that the pas yeWs revenue, after aigi epenses for;the yea xhows grcs balance Of 8,fi1, ad a net balance ; 5,687Z., a ter deducting all interest accrued on borrowed :money and on p reference shares. The directorsn are not without hope at further experienco, leading toa mors economica exPenditure, as well as an Increas ofC ncome from theaaditmnialtrafio-whih maybeowAnably.expected from the opening of the new railways, will show a;more en- cora g resull in fuxture years The best considerationt thatth directors have been -able to give to the subject of mnanagement leads them to believe that it is onlj by frequent noveltiet and varied attractlons that tho revenue of te company can be sustained. While the imporhnceof reducing thb e4enditure to a safe minimum cannot be overraed, the directors feeltihat nothing would be so prejudicia to. the undertakldng as to allow it to dHft Into a state of neglect, or to dnk below the highest point of excellence, in the maintenance of which they consider the chief element of prosperity Mll be founLd. ln conclusion, the dirctors recomramend the creation of a debenture stock to an extent not exceeding 250,000L, carrying a perpetual preference dividend of 6 per cent., ind forming a nrst charge over the whole propert of the company; the money to be raised by this mean to be appliod as Follow :-lst, in paying off the balance of 64,2lSW. due on the original purchaso of land; -2dly, in discharging the sum of 68,7991. dae to the capital acount, 3dlr, In paying off the existing debentures in the hands of the public as they fall due, vlz., 114,738h If these objects were accomplished there would then remain no lability on the company except in respect of the covenants in the lease of D)lwlch Wood, and against thees there will be the balance of 16,5281. to be received in respect of land already sold by the company, which *ould be more than an ample cover for any claum that might arise on this head, while if third parties eould be found to 'take the lease off the company'g hands all future liabiUtywoild cae.

2HE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH COMPA2T. On Monday night Captain Hudson and the officers of the United States' frigate Niagara were entertained at dinner at the Adell H[otel, Liverpool, by the shareholders of the AtLantie ela h Company resident in and near that town. The :Tv2 of the oompanion shlp, the Susquehanna, In-the Mersoy affordedo opportunityfor the extensLon of the hospitality to the eommander and officers of that rvel, anl among the 82 gentlemen who wero at dinner nearly one-hal appeared in the American naval uniform. The chair was occupied by Mr. Christopher Bushell. The toasta given- were "Her Majesty the Queen," "The healtha of theiPesident of the United Etates," "The Governmen*t of the United States and Great Britain," "The Bishop of the Dlocess, and the Clergy of all Denomlnations," "The British and American Foroes by Lend and Sea,' ackmowledged by Captain Sandes, of the Susqu ebanna, for the United States' navy, Colonel Bel for th British army., and Captain Bevis, R.N., for the Englishi navy. The next toast was " Captain Hudson and the Officers of the UniteI States' frigate lara." Captain HvDsom, in responding, said every effort should} be nsed ybhinself and his officers to lay the cable successfully, and he hoped that o t would never grow shorter until they reached the stations at each side the Atlantic6 (Cheers.) I believe (he continued) we shall have n% failure-I believe we shall carry the cable out safe, becau I have belief in that overruling Providence. It is watching over us; and I have no doubt when the cable is carried across the Atlantic, and when the electric res carry the news from one country to another, it wiiM be the means of moralizing the mnerchants of both nations. ("Hear, bear," and laughter.) That is in respect of their wld speculations. ( Oh!") The avantage of talldJg to each otherinthe way of trade will make all the difference. (Hear, hear.) Yes, the trath ought to be spoken. No manwill berminea by great hazarding, by the wild speculations of putting fortunes in their pockets in an hour. They wil be ontent to plod about the world's business, as I and my brother officers have done here for a period of many years, and Iama sorry to say that we are no richer than when we began. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, Captain Hudson ;roposed "The Health of tho Chairman, Christopher The toast was most warmly received. The CnA4rr&A returned thanks in eloquent terms, as suring the assemblage that the honour of having been anpointed to preside on such an occasion would be one of his proudest remembrances in after life. If a suitable intro. cuction ho then proposed " The Members of Parliament for the Borough of Liverpool and the County of Lancaster." He paid a personal compliment to the members sevkrally, and attributed their absenceo to the pressre of Parlia. mentary business. The toast was duly honoured. The C TirRA next, In an appropriate introduction, proosed" The Mayor of Liverpool," which was also most cor aayreecived. The next toast was " The Captains and Officers of the abipsAgamemnon, Susquehanna, andLeopard." Catain SANDxS, of the%Ssquehanna, bri sponde anid delegated his duty in that respect to MEr. lKidde,nhouse, the purser of the vesseL. The C .rAns& next proposed "The Chairman and Directors of the Telegraph Company,"coupling with it the same of Mr. Maxwell. The toast having been drunk with all the honours, Mr. MAXrmLL responded. He said that he, as a director, had never allowed himself to doubt of the success of the undertaklng; and if ever a doubt could by posif bllity arlse it would have been banished by the fact that two of the most powerful and enlightened Governments of the world had given their sanction and their aid to it. The CHR& proposed "The Electricians, Englneers, and other offlcers of the Atlantic Telegraph Company." Mr. BRiUGT returned thanks, and in the course of his spechsaid,he hadveveryreas9n to bnelievethat withinthres weeks of the present thme they would be able to send a message from Her Majestyto the Preident of the United States, The announcement was loudly cheered. The CaArsiaN next proposed "The LManufacturers of the Atlantic Chable." Mr. NzwAYz, of the fim of Newall and Co., returned thanks.

LONfDO2h TUSDAY, JULY 23, 1857. In the House of Commnons yesterday a large portion of the time appropriated to private business was occupied in the discussion of a clause inserted by tbe Houee of L6rdi in the Great Northern Railway (CaDital) Bill, declaring the liability of the dividends of the preference sharebolders equally with those of the ordinary shareholders for the losses arising from the frauds of Redpath. It was urged among other grounds of objection to this clause, especially by Mr. LowE, that its insertion was beyond the jurlsdiction of the committees of both Houses, and that the conrts of law should be left to decide the question of liability upon a construction of the legal instruments by which each clas of shareholdera held their rights. The House ultimately resolved to disagree with this amendment of the Lords. Mr. HAiDCAsTm, In moving the second reading of the Public Charities Bill, explained its objectsto diminish the expense upon the appointment of fresh trustees of charity property, and to afford to trustees an opportunity of incorporating themselves -and the means proposed for attaining those objects. The motion was seconded by Mr. EvANs. Sir J. TRoLnopE opposed the motion. He had, he said, numerous objections to the Bill, which involved a very large principle. ft entirely ignored the Charity Commi3sion, and created a new and expensive Government Board. He moved to defer the second reading for three months. Mr. MAssEY, on the part of the Government, likewise urged various objections to the measure, in particular the expensive and complicated machinery it proposed. The amendment was agreed to; the Bill is therefore lost. The Married Women Bill was ordered to be referred to a select committee. On the motion of Mr. MAGUM, after sundry speeches upon this often discussed subject, the order for the second reading of the Tenant Right (Ireland) Bil, which had been introduced by the late member for Mayo, was disoharged. The House then went into committee upon the new clauses of the Burial Acts Amendment BilL. A clause proposed by Mr. MASsEY, in order to remedy an alleged grievance arising from the refusal of bishops to consecrate burial-grounds, which provided that in any burial-ground certified by the Secretary of State it shall be lawful for the incumbent of the parish or his curate to bury prior to its consecration, underwent a very long discussion, the second reading of the clause being carried upon a division by 108 to 69. The remaining clauses were gone through. Certain Bills were read a third time and passed; others were advanced a stage, and the House adjourned at five minutes to 6 o clock.
Such an event as this Indian Mutiny makes us understand the disasters of 60 years since, and the coolness with which they seem to have been received. When the Nore Fleet had mutinied, when treason was rife in the very capital, when Ireland was in open rebellion, with a French force landed on its soil and a stil larger one threatening the shores of England, people went about their business and pleasure pretty much as if nothing were happening. It seems strange that all that drinking and jollity for which the time was famous could have gone on with the enemy at the gates and traitors within the walls. But ever and anon events happen which seem to light up hidden passages of the past. The coolness and concentration in his own concerns which mark the Englishman are fully shown in the aspect of society at the present moment, when the most alarming trial which the country has had of late yeaTs is upon us. Who seems to feel that the Army of an immense Empire has revolted, that a capital city is in the hands of an enemy instructed by ourselves in the military art, and that a few days may bring the news that British power exists only in a few forts or a few cities of the coast t Delhi, the capital of Mahomedan India, the residence of the heir of the Moguls, the chief arsenal of Upper India, and filled with cannon, shot, and shell, is in the hands of some thousands of Asiatics, many of whom are practised artillerymen. The place possesses warlike stores sufficient to stand a long niQgo, n rnd it is defended by a wall of considerable strength, considering the artillery we can bring against it; for, according to all accounts, we have only light guns, and are awaiting the anrival of heavier metal before commencing the attack. Iu themeantime all India is' looking out for news from Delhi. Not only throughout Bengal, where it may be said that every soldier is a mutineer at heart, but in the Bombay. and Madras Presidencies, the native troops arewavering, inclined to revolt, but afraid to move, and asking each other whether men of their race can really hold the chief city of their country against the foreigners who have til now swept everything before them. All depends upon whether General BARNAmD will prove himself equal to the occasion. It is an awful stake upon a man almostunknown. It seems to us that in this case courage amounting even to rashness will be more effective than caution and the most skilful combinations. The capture of Delhi is an affair in which days, even hours, are precious. No one doubts that eventuaUy a British force must tako a city garrisoned only by Asiatics, but the capture after a regular siege would be almost as fatal as failure. We cannot afford to make a Sebastopol of the capital of Upper India, although Delhi too is an arsenal, and we are marching to attack it without a siege train. While the troops are maling parallels and the General planning scientific attacks the whole of India would be in a flame. Every discontented Rajab, every unquiet tribe, the Monarchs of the neighbouring regions, and the unfriendly States of Europe might make use of the opportunity to inflict on the country loss and dishonour. The assault on Delhi must, then, be fervently hoped for. At all risks a bold General would strike a speedy blow. With the head-quarters of the mutineers in our hands, their principal force crushed, their leaders hanged, and their puppet MIonarch carried off to Calcutta, we might wait with equanimity the progress of affairs. The pacification of India and the restoration of British reputation must, indeed, be a work of time. But with the enemy unable to take the field, or even to hold any place of strength, with 20,000 English on their way to India, with the Europeans who are there graduaUy concentrating into something like an army, and the English families placed in safety, the GovmNoit-GE"ps might calmly pursue his policy of disarming and disbanding the Sepoy levies. This confidence, however, is not to be thought of until the mutineers are totaUly overthrown and destroyed in their chosen ralying-place. The operations at Delhi will determine whether what is now a tumult is to become a great war. In the usual style of our countrymen we will assume that everything that can be done will be done, and that complete victory wil crown the exertions of the Indian Generals. It is to be trusted that when tranquility is once moro restored the Government wiU seriously set to work to introduee those material improvements which wiUl be the best sulpport of the English dominion. We have now held India for very many years, and during the last quarter of a century science has inereased wonderfully the traffic of mankind and the communication between distantregions. What has been done for India during all this time ? Little or nothing-except in the matter of the Electric Telegraph, which has been extensively laid down and has rendered invaluable services during the whole of this business. Railways, however, have hardly begun to exist. In share-lists they certainly look very well, but the proportion of miles constructed to miles projected is ridiculous in a country remarkable for its resources and in the hands of a people famous for their enterprise. On the map of India a Railway is laid down from Calcutta to Allahabad, Agra, Delhi, and Lahore for about 1,300 miles. During all the years that Railways havo been known in. Europe, while every petty continental enterprise has been attracting the attention of cxpi. talisto, one would think that this, the great truink line of India, would have been pushed forward with all the energy of the moneyedworld and all the forethought of Government. But at this moment the line is only open from Calcutta to Raneegunge, a distance of 131 miles. The MIadras Railway is only open to Arcot, 65 miles, and in the Boombay Presidency only 88 miles have been constructed. How little effect these slowly progressing improvements have yet had may be well imagined. 'Unless such works be now carried on with new energy, it will be impossible to count upon any permanent authority in the more remote regions of the country. But it is of little use at present either to lament about what has been left undone, or to advise on what must be done when tranquillity is restored. For the moment, we, here at home, should consider India as a country the conquest of which has to begin again. It may not indeed be EO; on the whole, we believe that it is not so, and that the insurgents will fall asunder from want, from internal dissensions, and the absence of capable leaders, if even they be not dispersed, as we trust they may be, by iBritish bayonets and cannon. Yet it is our duty to be pre: pared for the worse alternative. It may be that Delhi will be able to hold out-not long indeed, but quite long enough to spread the spirit of treason through theArmies of all three Presidencies. It may be that the resources and revenue of the country will be diverted from its rulers for a year, if not for longer, and that we may be obliged to re-establish our shaken dominion by the pressure of a large European Army and the administration of unsparing punishbient. In this state of doubt we can only deal in generalities, and urge the Government to vigour and the people to sacritices. Tho next mail may bring news of the fall of Delhi, and in that case all will probably be well. But, should that event be unhappily deferred, and should it seem likely that the Native tioops can no longer be relied on, we see nothing but for the Government to ask, and Parliament to grant, powers as extraordinary as if Prance or Russia were our antagonist in some great European war.
If we were rather startled by the intelligence from Paris in our Second Edition yesterday, our second thoughts induced satisfaction at the very useful capture made by the Parisian police, and a wish that the haul had been rather more complete. Three Italian assassins, of the smaller dimensions, but with names of the most dramatic propriety, have been arrested, and sent up for trial, on the charge of a conspiracy to take the life of the Erzupmoi, and, unable, it is said, to resist the proofs brought against them, have confessed their meditated crime. So far as they are concerned, TnAnim, BAnToLorn, and GRILU will acquire a greater notoriety, and possibly in some well-conducted prison a more respectable existence, than they have hitherto achieved. But it is added that this metropolis has been the nest selected for hatching the conspiracy, and that ALzzr, LxEDiu RomaW, and two others, MAzARENTI and CA5rPAx7rtA, having been detected to be accomplices, will be included in the triaL That there should be conspiracies of the most diabolical character in this metropolis can exeite no surprise. Nobody knows what goes on in ''this huge wildemness of brick and mortar, where society itseif creates a solitude, where nobody is known, and nobody can be suspected. Wine-tenths of the people in this city have no means of knoving whether the neighbouring house is not one which ought to have an il fame, whether the vwiter of their own well is not .poisonued.by. musBlof 'ii llicit still neit door, or whether the fumbli3ig and thumping they have heard for years is tnot a mint for bad money. So, for anything we know, all the Potentates in Europe may be menaced in their persons, their money, their paper cuxrency, their property, their thrones, and their good fame, from the second floor in the opposite house, which looks so dingy and respectable. We give up all idea of preventing these things heie ; and, as far as ourselves are concerhed, we find it answer. In the end, and in confirmation of the old maxim which recommends in certain cases a sufficient length of line, this course seems to answer also with regard to foreigners. The plot so freely and easily concocted in this metropolis has not only been detected in Paris, but the incendiaries MAzzINI and LEDRU RoLLiN have been detected. It appears doubtful, indeed, whether they have not been included in the prgceedings now pending in Paris par cnurnace, and if so they can only be convicted in their absence. But, even then, as convicted assassins, they will no longer be able to show themselves in this country, and they will have to find some other part of the earth more congenial to the indulgence of their sanguinary dreams. We are aware that we shall expose ourselves to much feminine indignation in expressing ourselves thus satisfied with an incident likely to circumscribe MAzzLNIfs machinations. The young ladies who have been attending MiSS WHmTr'S fervid appeals to their Republican sympathies will set us down as mere brutes for wishing to stop the career of the great would-be tyrannicide. Young ladies in these days are generally much better read in ancient history than in modern, and better in both +han our young men from the Universities, and their imaginations naturally run on the best classic models. Indeed, it is commonly held that our young ladies are even physically stronger than our young men. So, if we cannot appeal to their moral sense against unlicensed homicide, we will appeal to what we may venture to call their manliness. Did the classical tyrannicides spend their lives quietly, comfortably, and secu'rely under the shadow of free institutions, always thrusting poor enthusiasts, imbeciles, and female admirers into the post of danger? Did BnUTsUS reside safely in Arabia or Parthia, and send a fair Asiatic to communicate with his accomplices at Rome? No. It was reserved for IMzzuii to invent this safe variation on an old and questionable heroic theme. He is always in the dark. Wherever he goes the footlights are lowered and a murderous gloom envelopes the stage, across the side of which a domino is seen stealing on some mysterious errand. By-and-by the bravoes appear, but the domino is -gone. This is the Pantomime of Republicanism. Never was a grand character so cheaply assumed. Of course, there is something to be said for it. " But for this vilainous saltpetre," not to speak of the rope, the axe, and the cell, MAzaii would be an assassin in deed as well as will, and, no doubt, in that case Italian independence, not to speak of human liberty and progress, would lose,tHiis gentleman thinks, their chief representative. We differ from him considerably in our estimate of his personal importance to the interests of the human race in general, and any cause in particular. We regard him as an incendiary, whose murderous designs expand in pro-. portion to his own sense of security, but who has no such regard for the security of his dupes. We' are not sorny, therefore, that he will now have to avoid the police of this country, and we shall regret if we find that hn will uot appear at Paris with his three miserable tools. With regard to -the Emperor IA6iroxIL, we need scircely repeat *wlhat we have so often expressed. We should regard his assassination not only as a base act, repugnant to all the nobler feelings of humanity, but as a national calamity, not only to France, but to this country. That strong will, that determined purpose, that taciturn tact, aro still necessary to restrain a voiatile nation, which is only now learning that the glory of a people consists as much or more in commercial enterprises as in bloody triumphs. We know, indeed, that under the guidance of adventurers this new spirit of peaceful development has been led astray to catch at many bubbles, and to rely rather on speculation than on the received principles of trade; but this evil spirit will pass away with the swarm of charlatans that have conjured it up, and a sounder system will follow. In the mean time, the first element of all commercial prosperity is a strong Government. Better, of course, we say here in England, if it be a constitutional Government; but still to be excused, when we consider the state in which France was between 1848 and 1852, if unconstitutional, so it be strong. We may rejoice under the shade of our tree of liberty without wishing to see it planted in every land if it can only thrive by being sprinkled with the blood of constituted authorities, and therefore we regard tbis plot against the life of an allied and friendly Sovereign with horror and detestation, and shall not be sorry to find that the trap which NA=N and his dupes are charged with having laid for the Emperor LOIS NAPOLEON has caught themselves.
There are at present several Bills before Parliament for, the improvement of the law of real property, and yet the prospect of any simplification in the system of titles appears as remote as ever. " Who shall decide," says the proverb, "when doctors disagree ?" Who, that is to say, is to arrive at a practical decision, and to carry it into effectf The patient himself has little difficulty in deciding that his disease is curable, and that some definite treatnent ought to be adopted; but during the conflict of medical authorities he finds himself absolutely helpless. Yet it is said that every man in middle life must be either a fool or a physician, and there are certain well-known remedies within the reach of the most ignorant invalid. But landed property is a more delicate subject for experiment than the human body. The theory of Conveyancing is a mystery known only to lawyers, and until they aro willing to apply their knowledge to the improvement of the system the unlearned many will look in vain fof any prospect of relief. The Law Lords constitute the most astute,.the most busy, and the most vivacious section of the whole community; and, unluckily, they are also the most pugnacious of mankind. Age cannot wither them, nor custom stale "Their inflnto variety." But their energies are perpetually wasted in warfare with each other. As often as two of them r.se in succession to speak on any question, the House of Lords instinctively prepares itself for an animated controversy. The victory in all such cases necessarily remains with the opponent of any proposed course of action. Lord Sr. ILEoNABD&s can defeat any Bill of Lord BRouGHAs'S, while his own'measures are at the mercy of the LoRD COHiCELLOR and of the LopBD Cma Jurcm. It seldom happens that the great legal authorities agree on the object which is to be desired, and they never concur in the methods suggested for attaining it. The ATTon y-Gmsumaa is in the meantime generally pursuing in the House of Commons some course especially his own. Those who possess and those who desire to _pcsess lane- propedy complan. Shat they can neithcr*0ll oio buy with economy, andthat theyeaninot even hold their estates with certainty. lNow, the ad valorem stamp duty for transfers of land and of personalty is precisely the same. The doconents which are necessary to convey real property are neither complicated nor expensive, for the freehold of half a county may be conveyed away on a page of letter paper. The doubtfulness of titles and the consequent difficulty of investigating them are the sole causes of the enormous cost of transfers, as well as of the anxiety which oppresses many apparent owners of prosperous estates. Lord BROUGHAM wasted his time some years since in an abortive and useless attempt to shorten conveyances. The records of title must be adapted to the circumstances which they recite. The complicated relations of a settled and encumbered estate cannot be expressed in a sentence; and the length of deeds, even when it is excessive, is but a secondary evil. It may be true that the rights of purchaser and of lender are seldom defeated by concealed mortgages, of which there has been implied notice; but the possibility of the risk is in itself a substantial evil, inasmuch as it is necessary to guard against it by elaborate inquiries and precautions. The danger of an insufficient title is far more common and alarming. A claim arising on the expiration of a life estate is sometimes prosecuted with effect, notwithstanding half a century of undisputed possession. It is also notorious that a safe holding title by no means necessarily involves a practical power of sale. Judicious proprietors shrink from all unnecessary exhibition of even the most faultless title-deeds. A part of the inconvenience is, as Lord ST. IEONARD'S suggests, inseparable from the existing law of landed property in England. It is impossible'to pass from hand to hand the title to a specific plot of ground, and at the same time to enable the owner to tie it up for twenty-one years after the expiration of any number of estates granted for lives in being at the time of the settlement. It is true that stocks or shares may be subjected to precisely the same limitations, and that the full powers of entail allowed by law are often exercised in the case of personalty; but it is only in the ownership of land that identity of subject matter is esteemed of primary importance. If a hundred pounds7 worth of Consols is missing the trustee can make the default good by paying the value of the stock, but Whiteacre and Blackacre have an individuality of their own, which is thought to admcit of no compensating equivalent. A farm may be settled on half a dozen existing reversioners in succession, with remainder to as many unborn grandchildren of the original owner; and it is necessary that at the expiration of all the contingencies provided for by the settlor the same farm shall be forthcoming for the benefit of the person ultimately entitled. A purchaser who inadvertently accepts a conveyance from any one of the intermediate holders will find himself helplessly defrauded. Every limitation which is permitted by the law involves a possibility of a flaw in the title, and skdlful practitioners must necessarily be employed to stop up every possible gap. lMuch may be said in favour of a more modest claim of iuterference with future generations. The right of disposal allowed to settlors and testators is not indispensable either to their own consciousness of ownership or to the reasonable security of families, but landed proprietors are scarcely prepared for a restriction of their present powers. It is important to distinguish between the unavoidable inconveniences of the actual law and the additional uncertainties which are created by a defective legal machinery. Lord ST. LEowArD's is justified in aserting that titles to land must necessarily ba complicated; but it is not to be inferred that ' he aiueu'ic;yhonlduWbe' aggravatea' by ecracy. Registration in 'foreign countries may. be simpler and easier, but it is nowhere so neoesary as in England. The longer and more confused the history the more necessary it becomes to record it with aceuracy. When the land of a proprietor is compulsorily distributed among his children, it would be comparatively safe to dispense with the registration of a notorious and inevitable transaction; but no memory can retain, and no sagacity can divine, the adventures of a property deliberately cut up into half-a-dozen particular estates before it arrives at an owner in fee. -Under the most perfect system of registration it will be necessary for conveyancers to examine the effect of al previous dealings with the property; but the materials for the investigation ought to be collected and arranged in a public office, and not scattered at random in attorneys' offices, in miuniraent-rooms, and in miscellaneous repositories. Lord Sr.LEowA&iu9sholds that regitration is im- possible and undesirable. Lord OaUrm= declares' that it is practicable and necessary. Common sense will adopt the more sanguine view, although professional sldll is required in contiving an effective system. No other proposed reform in the law suffers so much from procrastination; for the main difficulty consists in beginning, and the process wil become easier with every successive year. Landowners are in many cases unwilling to'produce their existing titles; but they may fairly be compelled to place on record aU future dealings with their property. The history of an estate for five years will convey some information to a purchaser, and when the registration has been in force for twenty years nine-tenths of all the doubts affecting title will be at an end. A much shorter time will eradicate all the prejudices which proprietors may at present entertain against the system. The value of their possessions 'will be enhanced by a large calculable percentage, .and their peace of mind increased to an extent which admits of no calculation. If the Law Lords and the Law Officers could be induced to work together for a single session, *the numerous difficulties of detail which beset an evidently practicable enterprise might assuredly be overcome. The good sense which would be displayed by concert and mutual toleration would, perhaps, constitute as effectual a clami to public esteem as the ingenuity which is exercised in perpetual squabbles and in reciprocal criticism. The great dignitaries of the law have long since satisfied the world of their cleverness. Their ambition might now be more effectually gratified by establishing a repatation for wisdom.
There is a small bit of legislation which we should be very glad to see carried through during the present Session, although, as Lord eAI. aIERsToN tells us, the days of the Sesslon are numbered. Yesterday Lord CAmrrim&'s Bill for the Suppression of Obscene Prints and Pablications, which has been passed through the Upper House, should have been discussed in the Commons. The Commons, however, who 'sat through the whole of a Wednesday's sitting, had other matter in hand, and when they rose at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon nothing had been heard of Lord Cx?BE&'s BilL We trust, that it may not be found among the shelved measures of three weeks hence, when our legislators have abandoned their dusty halls for the breezy uplands of the North and the delights of flood and field. The subject is pre-eminently a disagreeable one. Any man of decent mind would be desirous to ignoro it altogether, were it not that he cannot by ignoring it do away with the nuisance which Lord CBarmrELL has most properly brought before the notice of Parliament. It is a fact that in certain parts of London, and notably in Iolywell-street, vlich is a feeder of the mnost important thoroughfare of the metropolis, prints, song-books, and other publications of the most disgusting character are exposed to public view. So obscene and abominable are the contents of the windows in this locality that they defy description by sheer force of their own filth. Now, a question has arisen whether this nuisance cannot be abated ? -When the subject was first mooted in the Houso of Peers Lord LyDnuusr, for once of late years, took, we venture to think, a wrong view of the case. Because CosnEGGIo had painted and ABiosTo had written that which was open to objection on the ground of morality, therefore Lord LY?DHURST concluded that it was impossible to overset Holywell-street without declaring war against most public and many private collections of pictures and books. Torn JONies and the Acharnians must be considered as inevitable fellows in the same category with the foulest abominations which are exposed for sale in the windows of the regular purveyors of ordure. We may, indeed, carry the argtument one step further, and include the Apollo Belvedere, the Venus di Medici, and the chief authors of antiquity under the same sweeping definition. To the unclean all things are unclean. It is even much to be doubted if excess of drapery would have preserved a Vestal from the licentious imagination of a young Centurion in the famous old days of Imperial Rome, any niore than a dirty fellow can now be debarred from a monopoly of nastythoughts if turned loose amid the shelves of the British Museum or in the galleries of the Vatican. Every one, however, knows what is the effect produced upon the mass of mankind by the colections in the B8ritish Museum and the Vatican, and what by the pollutions of Holywell-street. There may with reference to this matter be a difficulty about a definition in words; there is none as to the application in particular cases of that iunwritten definition which is graven in the hearts of mankind, broad as common sense, deep as the wellsprings of morality and cleanliness. We should, no doubt, be considerably puzzled to concoct a formula which should strike down the obscenities of Holywell-street, and yet which could not be extended by ingenious men to the works of SHiKSPEARH. Any rational mind, however, will distinguish at a glance the difference between the cases supposed. We say, let the experiment be tried. The present evilis certain,-the evil which may arise from the attempt to suppress it uncertain. It is proposed to give power to the usual tribunals of the -country to decide what is and what is not an obscene publication, whether picture or book. Now, we start with the first principle, that in order to bring any print, picture, or book under the purview. of the law, irrespective of its stubject, it must be exposed for sale. If a man more energetically nasty than his fellows should have succeeded in getting together a library or gallery. of dirty things, he will be left in the full fruition of it. There is no cause for supposing that Mlessrs. LoNc3rAN Will get into trouble for selling a copy of Fielding or Snollett, or that Alessrs. COLAGI Will be annoyed by informers if they have in their portfolios an engraved copy of some picture by TrIT or CORRBOGIO. In the case of the Holywell-street obscenities, however, there will be neither doubt nor hesitation-they will be suppressed at once. The prohibition of the public exposure and sale of such disgusting publications will at least be a great gain, although we do not, of course, entertain any serious expectation that the secret traffic in such filth will be altogether brought to an end. The argument does not rest upon any such fallacious basis. No one supposed for a moment that botting woulj be totally suppressed when betting,ho;uses we:o put- down-no one tu}iposed that gambliag would ba suppressed when gambliug-houses wera pa t down, We do not aim at impossibilitie', but sixplI at the removal of open temptations from the path of those who are most likely to fall victims to temptation. Will any one seriously consider the two cases sup. posed above, and decide in all sobriety of thought if it would not have been easy to raise objections against any measure for the curtailment' of the nuisances indicated of a character precisely similar to those which have been raised aguinst Lord CAsPBErL's proposition for the suppressionr of the public sale of obseene publications? The result, however, has shown that the legilatots who endeavoured to oppose some obstacle in ihe way Of the dirty streams which caused us so much annoyance were in the right, and the objectors in the wrong. Let the same policy be tried once more, and we will venture to say that it will be attended with similar success. It should be considered that from the low price at which these publications are sold their injurious influence is mainly felt among a class of the community who from their pove4, their youth, and their inexperience, would be wholly unable to procure more costly incentives to vice. We would only ask of any member of the House of Commons who may feel any doubt u to the propriety of applYing some remedy to this evil;to step aside for five minutes in his walk from the Westend to the City, and to mark the age and dress of those who may be seen hanging about the windows of the infamous street already named, and then, if he be a father, to ask himself how he would like to know that his own children were exposed to similar temptations. Even if nothing more were gained than a removal of these abominations fror, the public sight it would be something, but we hope for even' more favourable results. It is to be hoped -that, by help of the provisions of this Bill, the machinery of the law may be brought unerringly to bear upon all persons who can be proved guilty of the sale of thes filthy publications. There should never be the slightest hesitation in applying the extremest penalties which the law allows against any person who may have been convicted of an offence so disgusting in itself, of such dangerous consequences to the community, and so wholly unredeemed by any palliation or excuse. The Bill, as it has been sent down to the Commons, has certainly been much improved. As at first introduced by Lord CawzEsm there were in it, no doubt, clauses which might have been wrested to purposes of annoyance and oppression, but as it stands we can see no reason for apprehension. Should, however, any gentleman in the Lower House be of a different opinion, we implore him to exercise his ingenuity rather in bringing the Bill into a shape which he may deem unobjectionable than in the d- cuasion of subtleties and niceties whzich never will be brought in question when the measure is fairly tried. The nuisance against which Lord CAMPsE is struggling is patent and notorious-, it is a disgrace to such a city as London, and to the age in which we live. Let us hear no more of such shallow sophistry as the impossibility of dealing with it without comning into collision with the owners of ancient, aye, and of modern libraries and galleries. The subject having been now broached, it is surely better to make an end of the work at once than defer the consideration of such a matter until another session.

SECOND EDITION, THE TIMES-OPFIxt, btursday Moalingq. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correppondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m.:- The followingparagraphpublished in the oMomitmr svaa transmitted to you this morning by telegraph. lIt publication in the official organ of the Governanent has produced a certain sensation here. I 1hardly know why it should. France does not now for the first time hear of plots for the assassination of her rulers, and their defeat. Advantage will -probably be taken of this circumstance for an application to the British Government, as the ally of France, to aid in rendering the political assassin powerless. That application will be made after the conviction of the parties, and it is thought probably -that Government will ask the necessary powers from Parliament. The Maniteur says- "C For more than a month the police has had proof -hat a plot had been formed in London to make an attempt on the life of the Emperor. " Three Italians, charged with the execution of ,this horrible project, were at Paris, and arrested. The arms also which were to have been used for -the perpetration of the crime have been seized; they consist of poniards, revolvers, cc. Brought to justice, the prisoners had already confessed their -crime and revealed the names of their accomplices. " The Government, notwithstanding, suspended theproceedings again3t them, in order that theeclat of the process might not be regarded as a means of in-fuencing the result of the elections which were about to take place. The proceedings are now resumed, .nnd an ordinance of the Juge d'hnstruction sends before the Chamber of Accusation aU the prisoners arrested, with their accomplices. "Their names are Tibaldi, Bartolottf, GriUi ,otherwise Saro), Mazzini, Ledru Rolin, Mazaionti, and Campanella." It is stated oi the authority of a high functionary that the secret sooieties in the departments had sent uip their contingent to Paris to attend B6ranger's funeral, and to take advantage of any disturbance that might break out, with a view to overthrow the Government, and re-establish the Republic. Several *rrests have taken place within the last few days. The report circulated of an attempt having been *nade on the life of the Emperor, at Plombiibres, is -denied. It originated in the fact of information laaving been given toithe Directors of the Paris and Strasburg Railway Company that it was intended to take up the rails between Vitry' and Bar-le-Dac. The railway was consequently carefully inspected before the Emperor's depatture, and every precaution taken against accident. Private accounts from Alexandria corroborate the statemsents mentioned in my letter some fow -days ago, relative to the efforts made by the Apostolic Vicar, backed by the French Consult to force the Gregorian calendar on the 'United Greek Catholics, the shutting-up of the church, and the 'anishment of the officiating priests. The writer of the letter adds- " The population, who still refuso to accept the calendar, -teelng the Consul inteiZere v Ith matters which are foreign to his functions, inasmuch as the United Greeks are a nation apart and entirely ruder the protection of Turkey, I -and, being doprived of their church and their pslest, more athan IC-S families have applied to the Schismatic PatiLreh, ; -vho has received them as converts to his faith. As soon -as the Bishop of Cairo becatne aware of the fact, l -he lost no time in proceeding to Alexandria, in order to de.- '2naud of the Vicar Apostolio by wvhat right ho issued such 4 orders, instead of protecting, as he ought to have done, the 4 -4ited Grecks; and also by what right the French ConsalGeneral iutest ered in a matter -with which he had no con. cern. The B)shop represented that the people were detor milned to preserve their ancient calendar, that they opened i a church for religious service, as the Patriarch had interdicted the use of his own, that for doing so tbey had the ufll authorization of the Government, and that it was not to J,e believed that the French lpvanmq - .,.1 A *Consal in thes0 actS 0o fijseliI. i "TheBDishop of Cairo thenaagreed with theVicar Apostolic to set apart an altar i the eharch of the PahiarchI where,a priest should celebrate mass for those who refusCd to accept tho Gregorian calendar. The priest who vWas aM- thorized by the Patriarch to perforca that duty refused. ffe eI had an interview with the Vicar Apostolio to indace him to alter his determination, which he at once did, being supported by the French Consul-General. The Vicar Apostolic had no riglit whatevor to interfere. The Bishop of Cairo'eeling keenly this injury done to hisreligion, wrote a strong letter to the Patriarch, and announceodto the seven Bishops isis colleagues, who, with their flocks, are opposed to the Gregorian crJeudar, the state of ailairsat A'exaria, and t -how the a^t of the ConSUl iD eh3ttng UPp the church forced so many to go over to the Schismatics. In addition to those whohave Ilready joined the schism, 50 families, seeing -themselves without a church or a priest, intend doing the salne to.day (the 5th). The Bishop has just received a telegraphic despatch informing him that great dLcontelnt prevails amlong the United Greelc populatiou Of Cairo, in consequence of the changes in the calendar, and matters appeared to himn so grave that be at once left for that city. I foresee that very unpleasant consequencen will spring out of this tampering of the Vicar Apostolic aid the Consul in our religious affairs; there are here hardly So who are disposed in favour of the Gregorian calendar." A recent publication on the colonization of Algeria purports to show wbat may be effected in that dependency by agricultural labolur. In 1 835 a military camp wes establilshed at a place called Bouflarik. A number of fo1owers opened canteens in wooden huts in the neighbourhood. Other followers added to the structures, and by degrees a village was formed. But the residenits who depended on the garrison allowed the land to remain uncultivated, and tho result was that an epidemic disease oke, t, and carried off 2 ) per cent. of the troops as well as civilians. Nearly the whAe of the children were swept away. When the presence of the troops was no longer necessary at BoulTarik they 'were witlhdrawn from the spot, 'whichl had the name of the " soldiers' cemetery," and it was anticipated that the civilians, who3e means of existence depended on the camp, would noon melt away. Under these circumstances the inhabitants set therselves to cultivate the ground. At first they experienced much diticulty, but by dint of perseverance matters assumed a more favourable aspect. rie country soon became salubrious, so mach so that the mortality declined to 2 per cent. below the average deaths in France. Sickly children and invalids are now sent there for recovery, aand the orphan school of the Abb6 Brumaull, which Is established in the building formerly used as a barrack, is in a state of prosperity. According to -this accounlt Bouffarik is the most flourishing agriscultural colony in Algeria. It produces -wheat, tobacco, mulberries, and cotton; and the friut trees - are renownved for their richness. The hectare of land (2h acres), vhieh was sold some ten years since for 50f., now fetches at least 1,000f. A Pole who settled there in 1843, with a capital of only 2,000f., is now possessed of landed property valued at 500,00[f. The writer asserts thatA]geria may become as Bonffarik wvith properX cultivation; but the 0,000 nliropeans established there are not eqlual to the task. It is calculated that out of the 40,000 iumsigrants arriving everyyear at Algeria the colony loses 35,000 by fever or by nostalgy. The llessager du Midi gives an account of the late explcrations of Captain Magnan inthe countries bordering the Danube. He has, it states, sent to the Emperor Napoleon a memorial sitting forth all the advantages likely to accrue to French commerce from the establishment of a regular trade -with the provinces on both banks of that river. Captain IMagnan est;Pnatei at not less than 150,00C head of cattle the quantity which these districtE could each year supply France with. The syndicate of the butchere' trade at Paris have promnisec their support to the Fraco Danubian CompanOy and have written to Captain Mag.,an to ojaoourage him in establishing a continuous curr,b'^t of c-atg importation into France. Independently of cattle, the memorial points out as artioles of export from the Danubian districts, wax, skins, wool, timber, dried fruits, flax, and hemp. French manufacturers would, on the other hand, place most readily articles of millinery and dress, furniture of superior quality, tissues, carriages, saddlery, hardware, books, stationery, looking-glasses, clocks, machinery, musical and mathematical instruments, &c. All such articles are highly prized by the populations of Moldavia, Vallachia, Transylvania, Servia, and Bosnia. The inhabitants have a decided preference for the products of Frauce, and it is, in fact with French marks that the Austrian traders enter their purchases. Captain Magnan states that he has himself seen in these countries articles, all of Austrian manufacture, bearing the marks of Mulhausen, St. Quentin, Elbeuf, Sedan, Tarare, Lyons, and St. Etienne. Capt. Maznan also declares that when once a&steady system of navigation has been organized on the Danube by a French company, the French ports will be able to furnish coffee and all k:uds of colo- nial produce to the Principalities from 15 to 20 per' cent. cheaper than Trieste doe3 at present. Signor Ezequiel Montes, Eavoy Extraordinary from the Mexican Government to the Court of Rome, has arrived in Paris on his way to his desti. nation. Signor Montes was formerly Mexican Minister to the United States, and in that capacity signed at Washington the treaty of commerce concluded between Mexico and the United States. Marshal Raudon, Governor-General of Algeria, embarked on the 19th inst. at Dellys, on the 'steam frigate Cecique, to return to Algiers. A public reception was preparing for him, and private lettesB state that his complete success during bis late expedition against the Kabyles has produced a profound i'nprezsion upon all classes of the population. Admiral Ilamelin, Minister of Marine, will accompany the Emperor and Empress of the French to England on board the Reine Hortense. TheL appointment of Captain Montaignac de Chauvence, of the Imperial Navy, and commander of the floating battery Devastation during',the Crimean war, to the rank of Rear-Admiral is announced. Captain, now Admral, Montalgna;, is President of the Commission on Packet-boats. A great number of decorations are to be given to the army on the oScasion of the fdte of the 15th August, but very few to civilians. Eighteen decorations have been sent to the Deparbment of Marine by the Grand Duke Constantine, as a souvenir of his visit to France. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received "MADRID, XuLy 21. "There has been a remarkable fall in the price of corn.

PRUSSIA. (FaRob OUV OWN CoRuSsPONDENT.) BERLIN, JTLY 21L There is still a perfect absence of all political svents or matters of striking interest. I have siready reported to yolu the return of the King and Queen to Potsdam on Friday last, and can now add the arrival of the Dowager-Empress of Russia, With the Grand Duke Michael and the Princess Cecilia of Baden, on Saturday. The Empress participated with the Royal Family in the commemoration of the death of the late Queen Louisa at Charlottenburg on Sunday; but the 1King, who has been advised by his medical attends to avoid aU unnecessary exortion for the present, attended Divine service at Potadam, with the Queen. As the reports continue to circulate about the Kiing's state of health being seriously affected, I may as well state in detail that on his arrival at Pillnitz, on his return from Vienna and Toplitz, be was afflected to some extent with diarrhcaa and determination of blood to the head, arising from his having travelled during great heat, and from his having, at Vienna, neglected those regulations of diet which are indispensable even when the course of treatment by mineral waters is at an end. Quiet and a cooler temperature are doing everything for him that nature requires. The arrival of the Emperor of Russia is fied now for the 25th inst. Various German papers represent the Emperor Alexander as having already had a mceting with the Emperor Louis Napoleon on Gennan ground, in the neighbourhood of Strasburg, on the 13th inst. Anybody that takes an inaterest in the matter may, however, easily prove an ,lili for the first-named Emperor, if he pleases. The grand field-day of the Prussiau CorpS de Garde and the Sd cOrps d'ArmFe, to be held September 15th, at Lichtenburg, is the occasion which has been chosen as the most fitting for the Emperors to meeti and the Emperor Louis bapoleon mas certainly received an invitation to be presont at it. His answer, whether accepting or declining the invitation, has not as yet been received, and is uuurwswuu w uepenu on tue result ot the correspondence now being carriedc on very diligently between the diplomatic representatives on both ses with reference to a fsature further approximation of France and Russia. The sudden. departure of the Emprems Euganie for Plornbieres is understood to have been actuated by her desire to be of the party when the two Emperors meet in the presence of the King of Prussia, a wish which, however, if really entertained, wiU be rather dificult of realization, as the occasion of their meeting is to be a military spectacle, at which no women of any rank, high or low, will, in all probability, be present. ITALY. A letter from Naples says " There is no doubt that the Neapolitan Governmen' will glve up the Cagliari. The captain alleges that he took a quantity of muskets on board for Tcrin, and 48 passengers for the same destination. The bills of lading and the passpoIts of the passengers were pextectly regular. When on the open sea, the passengers made him and his crew pz;soners, and took possession of the muskets. With these they were enabld to arm the prisoners of Ponzv. At Padula the judge was in their favour, and that circumstance probably induced them to make Padula their contre of operations. This judge died fghting on their side." A bancd of brigands, under the orders of a chief named Stringhini, having recently attacked v. dili- gence in the euvirorO of Cremona the loca] authorities hsave giveu orel that the stjiitest I surveillance shaU be exercised !0 there parts. Stringht-ii's band, which of 4{? 1t, well disciplined and grmed, has for several years bfL¢ the terror of the country, and has sometimes even gone the length of levying forced contributiois on villages. Stringhini, who is 3 years of ate, is teon' of a farmer, and pos3essed of a certain degree of education, having for some years attended the University of Pavia. He displays the greatest courtesy to the victims of his brigandage, having on one occasion offered a smelling bottle to a lady who was about to faint, and always having excellent cigars for gentlemen.

The European and American Company's steamUip Jason, Captain Britton, vith 168 passengers, nd dates from-Sew York to the 8th inst., and the randerbilt steamer North Star, Captain Lefevre, rith advices from New York to the 11th, arrived fE Cowes this evening. The Jason proceeded on to Bremen, caDing at the Tictoria Docks in the Thames to landu her pasengers, 185,000 in specie, and cargo, of which be has 1,000 tons. On +he 21st inst. she exhanged signals with the Dutch) ship Dogger Bank, n long. 10 deg., lat. 49 deg. 30 rain. She had fine feather throughout the voyage. The North Star has 165 passengers. She pro. eeded on to Bremen. There is scarcely any news since the last arrival. From Washingtonwe learn that M:r. Mandeville, ormerly of New York, has been appointed SurveyorXeneral of California, in place of Colonel Heys, who as been appointed the Surveyor-General of Utah. Mr. R. E. B. Stowe, son of Professor Stowe, was lrowned in the Connectiout river on the 10th. Hie was a student at the Dartmouth College. Judge Leavitt, on the 10th inst., discharged the United States' Deputy Marshal and his assistants from the oustody of the sheriff of Clarke County, Ohio. The Marshal's offence was connected with the arrest of an alleged fugitive slave. The New York street commissioners' case is in a more complicated state than ever. Two more victims of the riot of July 4 were recorded on the 11th-viz., Thomas Sparks, appointed a policeman on the 3d, and John Myers; the former was clubbed, and tbe latter shot. The British officers who took home the 'Panchita as a slaver from the Coast of Africa were arrested on the 10th at the suit of Mr. J. P. Weeks, and held to bail in $15,000. The owners of the bark were confident they can prove a wrongful seizure. The rumoured massacre of Colonel Sumner's command received no credence at the War Department at Washiington. The New York stock-market on the 10th was unsettled, and prices variable. Teuuessee Sixes declined a-half; and California Sevens, 2; New York Central Sevens rose 1; Delaware and Hadson rose a quarter; Pennsylvania Coal, a quarter. Erie declined a qnarter.

Money wiS easy, and grew more abundant daily. The cotton-market was exceedingly firm and business restricted in consequence. Middling Uplvids were quoted 14 fc.; AMobile, 14gc.; and ohcw Orleans, 15c. Flour had again slightly declined. Cornmneal dull. The market for pork was 10c. better In mess, but prices of other descriptions were without material alteration. Demand dull. The sugar-market was scarcely as firm, though there was no abatement in prices. Freights fiat, with no immediate prospect of abatement.
Ter "Lx L?N E[uNTzR" AT Thz PoLIcE COURT.- Mr. Gordon Cumming, who is at present exhibiting his trophies in the Clayton-ball in Liverpool, was charged before the borough magistrates yesterday with assaulting several persons on the 14th inst. while in tie Grand Junction Hotel in Liime-street. The chief complainants wero two persons nrmed Griffith and Hilis, who stated that on the evening in question they were sitting in the coffee-room of t3he hotel, where Mr. Gordon Cumming was taling hi supper with twvo friends, with whom he wasdiscussing the qualifications of the United States steam frigate Niagara. The complainants, having beer, on board, were interested in the conversation, and joined Mr. Cumming at his tabje, wben that gentleman (so they said), without any provocation, attacked them in a -violent manner, Griffith being severely cut about the face, while Ellis was also much injured. The barmaid and barmau came in, they stated, for some heavy blows. According to Mr. Cumming's version, and that of his friends, Griffiths provoked the assanlt,.by first malking insulting remarks aboutthe Englsh dag, and, when they were resented, challenged MIr. Cesming to fight, saying that if they would get UpOn the floor "Se would take the bounce ant of all three of thens." In commons politeness, Mr. Cumming said, he acmpted the invitation, and aa he didnot do tbhese kind of thing.s by halves, he gave the nau a aound thrashing for his impertinence. The magisate considered that the com plainants had drawn the chastisement on themn selves, and dismissed the smmmons.

HoWover, by the providence of A. lnighty God, your brother has been spared from the fearful m a2sacre that has taken place at Delhi, and though he is ac, .-PlBte beggar, yet, thank God, he is still alive and well. Oh, .N own dearest sister, the escape I have had has been most miraculonsa-x fact, I can hardly realize it, and when one comes to look back upon it, it is scarely to be believed, yet till here I am and no mistake about it; and as they say there is a slight chance of aletterreaching Bnbayin timefor ,his mail, Iamwritingtoyon. There isonlyone other officer of my unfortunmte regiment out of those who were with it at the time of the mutinywho ha, escaped to this place, and he, poor fellow, is in hospital with a musketball through his thigh-Osborn, our adjutant ; but I amn. glad to say there Were three others on leave for a maonth's shooting in the jungles at the time of the . out. break, aud who have consequently escaped-among them iny chum Wheatley. you know I myself had only been back from Cawnnore five days when this awful businesstook place. I havo been here now since the 19th of last month, and have not had a single line from my poor mother. All the dawks, you know, are cut off by the insurgents,. and though Ihave written to her several letters, yet r fear none have reachod Cawnpore. I was able, howover, thank God, to telegraph to them on the sth, saying I had arrived here safe and- well, and got a reply from my father. teDing what relief I had given them, but since then the wire has been destro-vd and there has been nzb com mmsication at all with Cawnpore. God grant they may be safe and well, and we have reason to suppose that the toop3 there are quiet. "There werethreo native corps at Delhi, besides a battery of 8ix guns, anu notl a single Euoropean soldier. It was about 10 o'clook on the morning of tho 11th that we first heard of some mlutineers having come over from Meerut, and that our zegiment 'was ordered down to the city, where they were, to cut then up. Of course this time ve had not a doubt as to their loyalty. Well, the whole regiment, except my company, No. 1, and ouir ma3or'3 the Grenadiers (who wero ordered to wait for two guns andescort them down), at onceo went off to the city, -distant aboat two miles. On arriving at tho .Casl2mere-gate, which leads into a small &A,fl- h-- - -7 JL- - - - -r A,VQm WnIIcn mere is another egress to the city, they were met by some troopers of the 3d Cavalry from Meerut, who immediately charged down upon them. Not the slightest effort was made by onr men to dtfend their officers, and they- were noarly all shot down at the head of their companies by these troopers. In fact, our poor Colonel was seen to be behoneted by one of the Sepoys aftcr he hRdbeen cat down bya troper; and then the fact of neither a Sepoy nor a trooper having been killed Is enough to convince ons of their treachery. Well, soon after our two ompanies, with the two gans (for whom ee had had to wait halF an hour), also arrived, and on going through the Cashmere-gate into the Mainguard and thence into the city, whereall this had taken place, the Sepoys and mutineers all bolted, being frightened at the sight of the guns, and before there was time to open upon them they had all disaDpeared into the streets. We then went back to the Mainguard, determined to hold that against them tillmore reinforcements arrived from cantonments, for which we immediately sent. In the meantime we sent out parties to bring in our poor fellows, who were all seen lying about in front of the Melnguard. I myself went out and brought in poor Barrowes. It was a mo t heart. rending eight, I assure you, to see all our poor chaps whom we had seen and been with that very morning, talking and laughing together at our coffeeshop, lying dead side by side, and some of them dreadfully mutilated. I had never before seen a dead body, so you may imagine what an awful sight it wasto me. The poor Colonel was the only one notkilled outright; but he, poor man, was hacked io pieces. We sent him back to cantonments, where he died in the course of the day.. At last some companies of the other regiments came up, and we remained here the whol6 day especting to be attacked every minute. Lots of womenI and people who had managed to escape from the city came in to us for shelter, little thinking of the scene that was shortly to be enacted among us. By and by three of our oiacers, who had escaped being killed by the troopers, also came in, and from them we learnt what I have, told youa above. . Al this while we saw fires blazing in the town and heard tuss firing, which we afterwards found out were the. sat|tin - ' - \ A n oie-alsg;risa ol usasirsnuV>u>w} ]g;Utu;sv! o£¢grek oat for the religion of their fathers, a plan which aucieeeded too welL Sonme of the Faldirs, itis said, bave been apptebended.

Meanwhile the Governament or the authorities had aU the new cartridges burnt to reassure the nien, bnt it had unluckdly just the opposite tendency. If, they said, there was reaUy notMing in the cartridges Government would never have burnt them all, but as they wera really greased witb Jlard they saw; they were found oat this tinoe nd barnt them, as the only way to get out of the mess. Now they say, such a powerful Government wiU soon find out some other way, so it is better to fight it out now than to find ourselves cheated into being Christians some day- unexpectedly, and then be unable to clear ourselves. The news from the other stations is, pe:hsps, equally bad. At Mooltan they are only restrained frona breaking out by Chamberlain's Irregular Cavalry, and at Rawul Pindee they are on the eve ol rebellion, it is said. Mooradabad and Barrilly troops are said to be firm, also the 21st at Peshawur. The spark that is said to have fired the traln is that one party of Sepoys did not refuse the cartridges, but tore off the ends with their hands, and woald not put them into their oouths, which the officer in command said was unsoldierly, and explalned all about the cartridges to them, vowed they were greased with ghee, and told them ve did not cara if they wero of all the religions in the world; batl unfortunately few officers left with their regiments are gooa hands at EHindostanee, and the Sepoys did not understand him at alL They only understood that he was determined they should bite "'WbU11, it must have asen aboat 5 oclookin the- afternoon, when, all of a sudden, the Sepoys who were vwithuls n the Mainguard, and on wvhom we had been depending so defend us in. ease of attack, began firing upon us in *very direotion; a most awful scene, as you may imagine, hen ensaed-people rauning iu every possiblo way to try md escapo. I, as lack would have it, with a fev other 'ellows, ran up a kind of slope that leads to the officers' Iuarters, and there, amid a storm of bullets, to one of the amllrasures ofthe-bastion. It is perfectly miraculous how 1 escaped being hit; no end of poor feUows were knocked 30wn all about, and all too bytheir men; it is reaUy awful to think of it. Hdwever, on arriving at the embrasure all st once tbe idea occurred to me of jumping down into tho ditch from the ramparb (one woald have thought it madness at any other time), and so try and get out by scaling the opposite side; but just as I was in the act of doing so I heayd screams from a lot of unfortunate women whc were in the officers' quarters, imploringfor help. Iimmediately, with'a few other fellows, who like uae were going to escape the same way, ran back to them, and though the attempt appeared hopeless, we determined to see it we could not take them with us. Some of them, poor creatures, were wounded with bullets; however, we made a rope withhandkerchiefs, and some of us jumping down first into the ditch caught them asthey dropped, to break the fall. Then came the difficulty of draggina them up the opposite bank; however; by God's will we succeeded, after nearly half an hour's labour, in getting them up; and why no Sepoys came and shot every one of us while getting across all this time is a perfect mnystery. The murdering was going on below all this time, and nothing could have been easier than for two or three of them to come to the rampart and shoot down every one of us. However, as I say, we somehow got over, and, expecting to be pursued every minute. we bent our " Itis not neatly so much. The distance between the two places is 20 coss, and the coss is usually retkone by Europeans at two miles, but in that part of India it is not more than one and two-thirds of a mile." " + They were, howeoer, neither nrurderedl nor, asit would appear, personally innltreated, although there was ample opportunity for both during their wanderings, especially after they had been robbed of their arms. With the exception of the Qoojurs, who are hereditary marauders, the Zemindars have behaved well to us, which is a great encaura6ement to good governmnent, for there cannot be a doubt that it ie mainly owing to tbe 30 years' settlement which has secured them against the unlinAted exactions of the old revenue system. The unifiorm fidelity of the native domestic servants, both male and female, has also been very reniarkable,; and the instances have not 'een fein which they have protected their masters and mistrosses at the bazard ol their lives.

This we reached in safety, and, getting something to eat and drink from the servants (their master, young 3Ietcalf, had fled in the morning), stopped there till dark, and then, seeing the whole of three cautonments on fire, and es it were a regular battle raging in that direction, we ran down to the river side and made the best of our way along its banks in an opposite direction. It would be too long, my very dearest sister, to tell you of how for three days and nights we wandered in the jungles, sometimes fed and sometimes robbed by the villagers, till at length, wearied and foo'sore, with shreds of elothes on our backs, we arrived at a village where they put us in a hut and fed us for four dals, ad moreover took a note from us into Meerat, whence an escort of cavalry was sent out, and we were brought safely in here. " We started from Delhi with five ladies and four officers besides myself, but afterwards in our wanderings fell in with two- sergeants' wives and two little children, with twvo more officers and a merchant, so altogether, on coming into MIeerat, we were a body oE 17 souls. Oh, great Heaven, to think of the privations we endured, and the narrow escapes we had! We used to ford streams at night, and then walk on slowly in our dripping clothes, lying down to rest every half-hour, for -ou munst remember that some of the ladies were wounded, and all so fatizned and worn ont that they coyul scarcely move. Of course, had we been by ourselves wo would have mad a a dash for MeeruSat once, which is about 40 miles from Delhi,," but having theso unfortunate women with us, what could we do? Sometimes wve heard villagers combining to murder us,t and the whole time were mI dread ot being pursuec and RIUCd by some ot the mutineers fromi Delhi. At one time, when we were attacked by the villagers and robbed of everything we possessed, had we not had them with us we would have fought for it, and sold our lives dearly, instead of quietly giVing up eur arms jm w <;, for You must know we had s Wor3 amaong U5 with Ong couble-bargaYit h send 90u a ~hort account of tho ecion, a ron whioh you Will Ne tha great many peopls escaped -o KUrnaul and Unibab h, anDg them the major of any -regimeat j but, dala, I fear we are je onllY ones sved.

The first I heard was that tbe troops At Fero`epozi had joined the mutiny, and had tried to take the Old Fort, but that a company or two of Europeant had been sent there in anticipation, who after a hard 6ght had held their own, but fought only- with the butt-ends of their muskets; that they then went off to the station and burnt down the Monumental Churcb, the RZoman Catholic Chapel, and every thatchedhouse, plunder. ingas they burnt; that M1r. Coates and Mr. Hughes; two onerchants, alone refused to fly, collected their servmits, Foitified their houses, andrepelled all attacks, M1r. flughess ;on,, a boy, killing the' only Sepoy shot; that they then ?ulled down'umbers of unthatched houses. Next day they were attacked-tbe 10kb Nativ' Cavelytakin torn ~ - -;urar-Zij -UtUOuc, 'Wno esoaped itnto the villages, where tliey are beiDg apprehended. At Um. balla and Jollundhur much the same-houses bunt, but no 'lives lost. AtItTmballa the deserters were more merou, but the Patiala Rajah had apprehended many of them. He wAs the first, as he always has been, to come to our aid, although we did tako Bndhonr from him forcibly so latiely. Now we learn that the. Europeans took the fort at dgra, and hold their own. there; that the Allykhur troops loth Native Infantry) had mutinied and gone to join thelorce at Delhi, and that.the Commander-in-Chief was still jtatio*ay at Umballa, tmwilling to' move till he had a larger force. The imila and Almioia Goorka troops have also mutixied, but it is hoped they are coming round. The troops at Lshoio were in vigorous hands. Sir John Lawrence and General Reid, aided by Brigadier Chamborlain, were not men to wait for orders in such an emergency, and have dis. armed the troops both there and at Peshawur, only just in time, as we learn, as they were waiting for the news from Delhi, where it was agreed the mutiny should begin. Half of one of the regiments at Peshawur was at an out station (Youshera), and was not disarmed, as a few men . alone could do nothing ; they got the signal from Delhi, but did not know their conrades at Peshawur had been disarmed; so they rose, as agreed upon, and found themselves in a narrow pass between two European cantonments, and a force has started to snake a fearful example of them. AR the native States are with us, and have sent in their contingents to aid the English, excenh rlMsh1 . -, : o- --- -. -6 WL 15 poraing great supplies ofammunition, corn, &c., into a1 his forts along our border. Well, the Sepoys, as I learn from really good informants, all believe that we are determined to make theui Christians by some meanLs. They believe that all we want to do is to make them eat pig's fat or bullock's flesh; and, unfortunately, tho cartridges for the new Enfield rifle were greased, aud in some places the grease, I believe, really was lard or common bEllock's fat, the native contractor having used these for cheapness. Ia this frame df mind, which has been going on for several years, they were very suspicions of anything noew, and belioved at once that the Government really had had the lard put on to cheat them into becoming Christians, and regiment after regiment held meetings to resout this attack on their religion. AlR the officera who were well acquainted with Hindostaneebeingselected forstaffappointments, only those were left in most regiments who, knowing but little of the language, had bet little intercourse with their men, and therefore they learnt nothing of aU this, except in oio or two corps, where somne chance lingoist remained, and these corps have generally not nnutinied, as their officers learnt thesr complaints and explained the matter to them. It is _ - _ _ . . .. . -- on ana no; rear Ot te en ou ot eno CartrlOge, ina imimediately felt sure that there was somnething in it, so mnutinied. There is a great want of sympathy between tho European and the native, which destroys all hopeas of cornfort, unless you could fall into all their usages. We are all well here. God has hitherto protected us, and we now seem to think all is over. A splendid force is collected in Kurnal. The native States believe that we must win in the end, and have sent their troops to our aid. We can only trust in God, who is equally able to protect us anywhere. We are in the midst of a mutiny unprecedented in Indian history, and are only a smaU bax4d ot EBvopeans, fighting and struggling for existence. However, the regiment here is very good, and deserves tho title, so common formerly, of fte faithful Sepoy. THE MUTINY AT NTSSEER-ABAD. The following is an extract of a letter from an offlcer in the 1.5th Bengal Native Infantry. It is dated Beaur, MIay 31:- " The day after my return reports began to be circulated about the disaffection of our regiment and the 30th Native Infantry, most of them being to the effect that our men were the instigators. We fancied these reports much exaggerated, aud inawgirted that, though our mern might follow in a move of the kind, they would not be the fir.t to lead the way. The result shows how mueh we were mistaken. Every precaution was taken for the safety of the station. The Cavalry (Ist Bombay Lancers) were nearly all of them under anns every night, and strong bodies of them patrolled the cantonment. The guns were kept limbered npall night and loaded with grape, and a detachment of 250 Euro. peans of Her llajesty's 83d and some Europeani artiUery were sentfor from Deesa, about 200 miles south-west of Nusseera. bad. I used to sleep with a loaded revolver and my sword by mny bedside, and should not have been in the least surprised if I had been awoke any night and told that the Sepoys were firing the bungalowg. which in other places seems to have been a preliminary step. The excitement seemed to calm down, or at any rate we got easier in our minds, and fancaed that the crisis had past. On the night of the $7th I happoned to be on duty, and on going round the station at miduight fonud ever5thing remarkably quiet. 1'ext day,, v,hen I v;as eo-ting my tiflEn in ray own housa, aboub half-pasb 3 in the afternoon, my servants rushed in saying that the men had risen. I called for my pony and armed myself, and then went over with W - to the Colonel's. When he was ready we started for the parade ground throughone of the streets running betvveen thoSepoys' huts and their lines. The men wero coming out of their huts and loading their muskets, and I expected they -wouid have epoped at us as -we passed. On reaehiug the quarber-guard vre found some of the men had already turned out, and by degrees the men of the different companies feull in in IrQont of their respective lies, and were brought np and formed into open column.

I dcdged round the first bell of arm8 (a small square bIilding detached from all others, in which the arms were kept). aidas I passed each bell saw three or four men- behindl each, 'who deliberately Ehat at us as we passed. Bither may t4t swerved before I came to the sergeaat-mjo-ef bungalovr, or else I saw more men in tho road - I don't know which. At all evbnts, I had to.steer viith great difficalty round the outside of the house, which brought me again on the openx parade ground. Round the corner, and I was comparatively saWe. A. moment or tivo more and I was safe among the cavalry, who were drawn up in rear of their own lines. Every one of uas came in sae by God's mercy. P-'s charger, a very fine animal, dropped dead directly he had brought his taster into safety. The Colonel had an awully narrow escape; his horse swerved right roand at the start, and we thought it was all over with him. The horse, received one bhsl in the forehead, another in the neck, and his knee was grazed by a third, but be brought the Colonel in safe, a'd is still alive. We now had the eiplana. tion of aU the firing we had heard goir,g on at the ariUery while we wore standing nnderarms.

Upwards of 1,600 persens wero present on the occasion, mncluding the wives and danghters of the members of the society. Mr. Hedworth D. Barclay presided. Since the establishment of the instithxtiou in lS03, which was incorporated by Royal charter in 1S36, no less than 1,3D1 boys and girls havehbeen. admitted, the number now participating in its benefits beimg 13. The usaal loyal toasts having been drunk the children were introduced, and presented a most pleasing sight. They all bore evidence of their health being especialy cared for, and their very neat attire, which was devoid of any badge that could in any way distinguish themx fiom What'they in reality vere, the sons and daughters of respectable but decayed members of the trade, was nu'ch admired. The Chairman, in proposing as a toast, " rezosperity to the Licensed Victuallers' School," pasEed a high ealogium on the governors and committeo for the admirable manner in which the institution was conducted. Its internal ariangements were perfect, and the education which was imparted to the cLildren was sound and practical, their moral culture and mental traiaing beirg well adapted to fit them for fillieg useful and reputable positions in society in after life. It was a gratifying fact that many who had been reared in this inEtitution had afterwards become larRc contributors to is runas. Sn .eeurttary last an alteration was made in the roles of tho society, by -which tba sum of 1,000L per aunum from the profits of the .loraitng Adrcrtistr was permianently appropriated to the support of the schooL Another important step had also been taken. Hitherto the land forming the site on which the sehool was built had been heldonlease under the lordofthe manor, but it had been determined to enfranchise the land "and thusvest the freehold in tho trustees of the institution' The school wasoriginally intended to receive '2-O scholars, but he re gretted to say that that n4hberhad never yep been attained. In 1,3') the number of children received into the institution w4s 167, at the present mo-ment thco were only IS!. The e=pense of orryingon tbeestab]ishmentwasabout3,000i.A-year, but the wIholo income did uot amount to that sum. Takivg the 1,COOI.derived from the profits of the Aforniv A dvertier, about 2001. produced by the annual ball, and 1304. as dividerd on tbeir funded property, still left upwards of I1.i`7I. to be raised by subscortionsiadedonations. The sum tat wotuld be required ftr the enfranihisement of the site was about 4,0001. These were heavy demnsds on the itusibers of the trade, but he hoped their beneficence would keep pace with the claims that were made upon them. Mr. Smalley, the secretary, then read a list of donations:Among others were the Dames of Mr. Roupell, M.P.,. 50 guineas, to.axds the general fund; tIre ChWiTmau, 5Q guineas; Barclay. Perkins, and Co., 300 guineas, besides 50 uineas' annual subscriptidn. Several other niemubers of tho 13arelay fauri1y also contributed largely to tho gen:eral frnnd, |tbeir contribrutions amountirg altogether to 3411. 5s.

MoNEY-MABKR'adaCITYThTELLIGENCE. Wdnesday Evening. The funds opened steadly this morning, although without animation, and were fairly supported till the middle of the day, when the market asumed an unsatisfactory appearance, very general uneasiness being manifested in consequence of a renewal of the vague reports of bad news from India. Consols for money were first quoted 911 to J. Subsequently one of the principal dealers commenced making large ales of stock for delivery, and a faUi took place to 91i. There waa then a recovery to 911 to 1, but it was not maintained, and the last transactionA were at 91i to J for money and 91t for the account. The prevailing sensitiveness was increased by the knowledge that a Cabinet Counocl was sitting, and that the ordinary telegraphic communication with France was interrupted in consequence of the line being occupied by the English Government. It is not supposed that any intelligence can have been received by individuals in advance of that to be brought by mail or Government steamers by tho Red Sea, but much uncertainty prevails as to whether a quick despatch may not have been secured bya private enterprise i Cagliarior Constantinople for any important tidings arriving in that manner at Suez or Alexandria. The public, therefore, become intenselye2citedwhenever there Is the slightest symptom to create a suspicion that something has become known. In the course of the evening it was announced that the telegraph with Paris was again open, and it was assumed that if there had been any foundation for the recent rumours, they would before this have assumed a more definite shape. Supposing any satisfactory accounts to arrlve, they will, after the anxiety that has been felt, create an extraordinary rebound. Bank Stock left off at 214* to 216; Reduced, 911 to 92; New Thee per Cents., 91§ to 92; India Stock, 216 to 218; India-bondu, 20s. to 10s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, Gs. to 2s. discount. MIoney was in demand in the Stock-Exchange today at from 5 to 5i per cent. Inthe discountmarket azd at the Bank there was also some increase of activity. In foreign securities Turkish is the only stock much inquired after, the speculative transactions in the Six per Cents. having been rather numerous. No bargains took place m the Four per Cents. guaranteed. In all other descriptions great dulness prevails. Mexican were negotiated, for the account, at 221; Peruvlan Feur-and-a-alf per Cents., 81; for the account, 811 ; Portuguese, 45 ; Spanish, 40k; the Certificates, 5 ; Turkish Eix: per Centa., 95 and 941; for the account, 95, 95i, 941, and 95 ; and French Three per Cents., 67f. 75c. The final quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening failed to arrive, but transactions took place in the Three per Cents. shortly after the opening at 67f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing another decline of nearly a quarter per cent. The corn-market this morning was less unsteady, but there was no actual recovery from the decline of Monday. About 12,0001. of Amerlcan gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The letters from Paris state that the stock of bullon in the Bank of France has experienced a further diminution, owing to the demand at the branches caused by the requirements for the harvest and the reeling of the sik crop. In the House of Commons this morning the clause introduced by theLords in the GreatNorthern Railway Bill,promoted by Mr. Edmund Denison and his colleagues, to prevent the preference shareholders from asserting their claims in a court of law, was rejected without a division. A conviction that it would have been calculated to destroy all confidence In preference shares was strongly expreased by several members. The entire case will now have to be submitted to the judicial tribunals of thecountry, and this degree of justice was all that was sought by the parties interested. Whatever decision may thus be attained, all persons will be willing to acquiesce in it . It has been announced that the cable of the Atlantic telegraph is finished, and that its shipment on board the Agamemnon asd tho Niagar ws com-pletewtbiL morning. These vsseli will sail on Saturday forueenstown, and In the ensuing week they will commence laying down the line from Valentia-bay. The process, it appears, is to be carried on entirely from this side, the vessels steaming direct toSt. John's, Newfoundland. Originally it was proposed that they should join the two portions in the middle of the Atlantio, and that the Niagara - should then steam for America and the Agamemnon for England, each paying out the lne until they reached their respective ports. Advices from Constantinople state that the attempt of the native hous to form a national bank has failed. It was thoughtp robable the Government may resolve to send a commissioner to London to negotiate on the subject. A meeting is to be held In the city to-morrow (Thursday) of the supporters of Baron Rothschild, when it is believed he will resign his seat, and thus give the electors of London an opportunity of manifeating the feeling with which they regard the recent vote of the lRouse of Lord. The directors of the Crystal Palace Company have addressed a circular to the shareholders recommending that for the removal of the financial uncertainties consequent upon the present form of the floating debt of the company a debenture stock of 250,0001. should be created, to carry aperpetual preference interest of 6 per cent. The charges to be paid off amount to 247,7551. The directors at the same time very properly deprecate the anarchy which usually characterizes the meetings of the company, and intimate that they have no desire to continue in office unless with the entire confidence of their constituents. In the resrumg yesterday of the Indian debt the capital of the Company was stated to be 12,000,0001. It is only 6,000,0001., liable to redemption by the Government in 1874 on payment of 12,000,0001., or at the rate of 2001. for each 1001. stock. At a meeting of the Clarendon Mining Company of Jamaica to-day it was resolved to sink a new shaft, at an estimated cost of 19,2001. (extending over four years), exclusive of the cost of transport and erection of machinery. To meet this expenditure a call will be made upon the shares, the cash in hand amounting to 5,0371. only. Although in committee on the new Banldng Bill last night the amendment in favour of limited liability was abandoned, its withdrawral was merely on the representation that the moment is inopportune for its discussion, the question being among those before the Bank CIharter Committee, whose report it will be desirable to await. The matter therefore is but postponed, and if the present paternal system is to be maintained its advocates must be prepared next seson to show upon what grounds a principle which is no longer applied to joint-stock companies in their dealings with commodities of which money is simply the represenitative should be continued with regard to their dealings in money itself. Meanwhile it would be waste of time to reopen the argument. A remark la necessary, however, on the indirect attempts made by several members on different occasions to impuga the result of limited liability as already witnessed in general trade. All the supporters of that measure were well aware at its introduction that for several succeeding years it would have to bear the odium of every financial difficulty, just as free trade was for a time the scapegoat for all political Or domestic evils. It has turned out, however, thus far, that the results have been wonderfully smooth, much more so, indeed, than could have ben hoped by the mos sanguie supporters of the change, since a state of transition always warrants anxiety. Of course, the allegation is ready that this is to be attributed not to the inherent soundness of the law, but to the peculiar state of the money-market, which has checked speculation. There is always something to prove that those who resisted reform wrere perfectly righ4 but that the untoward course of P?rovidence In eomb way prevented the fulfilment of their predictions. It was the Autralian gold discoveries alone that falsified the Protectionist prophecies of 1847, and if Baron Rothschild were admitted to Parliament to-morrow and the country were not unchrlatiAnlzed, there would doubtlem be some speeial interposition to account for the anomaly. But the faot, whatever may be the mode of explining it, atill remains, and if It were neary It could easy be proved that the presauro of the last year or two has not prvented a fair tril of the ystom. May companies have been started under it; some have gone on to respectbility and success, others have failed, and others have wound up. In every way, therefore, its operation has been tested, and the most gratlfying circumstance connected with this expe. enoe is that it haa been found that the prudence of the public has been stimulated instead of disarmed, and that In no case have they suffered damage. The greater reserve with which credit is given is a striking feature, and several concerns have apparently been forced to wind up, not from absolute losses, but from inability to carry their transactions to a paying extent. In the long run character will be the ground on whioh they must all stand. If a concern appears to be well managed, it will be trusted to any requisite amount; while In theoppooite case the fact that there is no mysterious source of wealth in the shape of a body of unsuspecting shareholders to fall back upon will beget caution even on the part of those who 'would otherwise, by granting recldess credit upon extortionate terms, be ready to assist in bringing it to ruin. If the fact were kept in view that it is those who give credit without inquiry that destroy all sound business, there would be less anxiety to maintain a system that seems to have been framed solely for their encouragement. But the cry always is, " You mustmake theborrowerprudent-wiot the lender." In this way great alarm is, expressed by many persons at that clause of the new Banking Bill which proposes to allow any number of persons beyond six to associate as a company for baning purposes. No importance eenms to be attached to the fact that it is not proposel that the law shall compel any one to trusbt them. It Is aid " they will enjoy all the stains In sciety and all the advantages which a joint-stock bank enjoys." But a joint-stock bank enjoys no particular status, except such as it derives from Its capital and proprietary. If seven unknown men, with 350l. paid up, choose to invite the deposits of the public, are we to beHlve the public so incapable of resting the invitation that we must make a special law to restrain them? If so, vhy not make laws to prohibit them from every other imprudence to which in the exercise of their free will they may be liable ? The belief is that the public, on the whole, ought with the assistance of the Oriminal Courts to be able to takle care of themselves, and that, at all events, if they are defective In this power they are not likely to acquire it by never being allowed to try. It would be at least but fair that the experiment should be made. A year's trial can scarcely yield ua combination of cases worse than those of the Tipperary the London and Eastern, and the Royal Briish Banks, and if the Government still find that we are unfit to be out of leading-strings theyr can then return to the proteetive methed, which In the space of little more than 12 months presented us with these specimens of its utility.

LoNDoN AID MIDDLESEx ABCAOoLOGICALiSoo]y. -On Tueeday the members of this society and their friends paid a visit to the Tower of London, and the attraction of a complete inspection of this celebrated palace-fortress, so identfied with the history of this country since first erected by Gundulph for William the Conqueror, produced an assemblage of between 400 and 500 persons, of whom a lage portion were ldes. The societr were received with peat courty by Lord de Ros, Colon Whymper, and the higher mriltary authorities, at 12 o'clock, on the Tower-green, and the day being fine, with a cool breeze, the business corn mencedon the spot, with an address from Lord de Rog, in which he briefly alluded to the changes in the aspect of the Tower since the fire, about 15 yeas ago; his Lordship also stated the anxious desire of the authorities, in the alterations and restorations then in progress, to preserve the ancient features and character of the fortress as much as possible in harmonious comnplateness; lie therefore weloomed the advent of the soeiety, whose visit could not but be in many respects beneficial, by drawing public attention so influentially to the Interesting memorials of the past around them, in order to their future perfect conservation. These remarks, being so arch=eolog cal in spirit, were of course duly welcomed by the aesemmy, and a short paper was then read by the Rev. Thomas Hugo, as preliminiary to inspecting the various buildings, in which he criticized the taste of Sir Christopher Wren In restor. ig portions of the Gothic architecture of the Tower. The hon. Secretary, the Rev. Charles Boutell, after submitftig several names of candidatea for adninoul to the socety, then judiciodsly arranged the company into eight distinct caions forthe greater convenitene Oand toavoid over-crowd.

ST.AM v. SAiL. TO THE EDITOR OF TEIB TIMES. Slr,-No period of our Indian history caa have been aoro critical than thepresent. Its influenoe over our national destinies cannot be too highly etimated. This [empire is in a state of perilous revolt, while the event of the awful drama seeas to depend on the wisdom and energy of the men now at the head of public affairs. More than one member of the Cabinet has ventured to assert in the Houso of Commons that sailing vessels would mako &a quick a voyage to India as tteamers, and this monstrous assertion remains unoontradicted. The Firs lord appears to have been umaware that screw rmen-of-war used even as sailing vesels are faster than hired transports. Every schoolboy knows that there Is a region about the Equator of constantly recurring calms, in which vessels aro sometimes detained for weels The vriter once fell inwith an Anerican clipper schooner that had been almost aotionless for 27 days. She was not 40 miles from the limits of the variable winds, and but for the supply of water from his ship her crew might have perlshed inthe calm. It is trae our screw vessels do not uly carTy more than aix or seven days'fuel for ful steming. Ies than two days' halt steaming would take a ship through the region of dms. The rest of the fuel could be used when calms occurred ia other quartrs, and, as these are generally met WIth in narrow belts onlt (except at the Equator), a short run takes a vessel into the steady breeze again. A sailing vessel bound to India is obligel to make a long stretch to the westward to get Into a position to take advaatage of the " Trades," whle tbe ateamer boldly takes the direct-course, so that, allowlng for difficulties under every possible circumstanoe, the latter must make her page In much less time than the former. Who does not know the Importance of minutes in war? Upon minutes may depend the mightieat interests of nations. Here are weeks to be thrown away, troops disor ganiaed, and subjected to contagion and disease from long confinement in sailing vessels by the suggestions of oommon sense and experienco being disregardea whichz are followed in every private enterpriso; but where an empire of ome hundred and elghty millions, and eren ear own posl. tion asafirst-ratePowerdependontheplansdoptedandthe promptitude with which those plans aro carried out, we are by a shortsighted and erroneous systm doomed perhaps to witness a'recurrenceof a series of mistakes and catastrophes worse than those which characterized the late war. If the events occurring In India are such as to require the important military measures In progress, they demand equally extraordinary exertion on the part of 'ths nsay to take out troops as expeditiously, as possible% and in the most effective conditiov. If sufficient bounties are given good saiors, and enough to man 20 sail of the line, could be entered in a week. . Take t'he main and lower deck guns out of the ships, man them.with able sea. men (half the war complement; the soldiers aill temporsa rily serve as Marines, as they have oft en done before). Each of; the larger screw line-of-baffle ships could easily convey 1,500 troops, and with a few of the larger steamers in the servico, or even hired steamens If necessary, a fresh and effective army could be landed in India In ten weeks from the time of departure. There is another and a more rpid mode of eonveying troops, which might soon be made avaable under urgent circumstances, which at once presents itself to the mind. As this is a question of civil war in our own territorlse, there wouldbo no difficulty in obtaining permdssion for on?r troops to Cross thelsthmusof Suez, theterritoryof afriendly Power. Electriclty and steam would give notice for tho necessary preparations being made to move and feed the troops to the shores of the Red Se The rapid postal means of communication would convey orders to the govermment at Bombay to forward every disposable vessel, hired or otherwise, for the re-embarkation of the troops, and in six or elght weeks our men are in Indla All the necessary gear for fitting out the ships from Eng. land is ready in our dockyards. With the men from the ships in commission at home, those from the various dockyards, and, if necesry, extra men hired from the class of riggers In our great seaports, the ships might be rigged in a week; the carpenters in the reantime would be setting up the troop-fitUngs, other hands stowing the hold with provislons, &c., and, if very hard pushed, a squadron with tho troops on board may be under weigh in one week from the moment of commenclng the preparations. Hundrods of smart, intelligent, sailor-like offlicers are longing for employment, abundance of men are to behad, steamship3 of all class are to be found in the Royal naval yards as well as in the merchant service. Beyond disputo the crids is momentous. The welfare of our country for ages to come may be influenced by decisions which must be arrivod at within a few days. Even hours are of inestimable vailue, but rd tapelim, with its inseparable inefficiency, threatens to render useless our boundless moes and to risk the loss of our Indian empire. Under present circumstances we are strong or weak in reference to Indai as we employ time. Ten thousand troops added to our actual reliable force there, arriving within ten woeks from sailing, would be ten times the value of 15,000 in 14 or 15 weeks hence. Ten thousand men embarked in screw or steam vessels capable of containing 15,000, the spare space being appropriated to coals, the power of speed thus gained would be of more value than the extra 5,000, who could follow in any manner most convenient to arrive in time to clinch the nail which the 10,000 would have so materl1ly assisted in driving home. If so many " Barnacles" have accumulated around our war steamers as to prevent their efficiency in time of emer. gency, why tax the people to maintain such expensive machineryforthe "Royal game of goose, " More for ornament than rse P leBt us rather return to the time previous to our seventh Harry, and hire all our ships of war when required.

Last year, about this time, there were the same complaints from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, and I then reported that the splce merchants of the city located about Eastcheap are accustomed to bleach glnger, pepper, and allspice by the aid of the fumes of burnmg sulphur, and, as no proper provision is made for the disposal of these fumnes, they escape Into the air of the neighbourhood, and are a frequent cause of annoyance, the annoyance being very great at this wason of the year, when the temperature is so high that persons endeavour to obtain a free circulation of air by o]elnng the doors and windows. The same kidnd of annoyance is caused bv the bleaching of horsehair and by those who are occupied in revivingthe oproperties of damaged hops. Inmoist cases these bleacng t operations are conduetedifn the upper rooms of high buildings; and when it happn that the outlet for the fumes is much above the level of the surrounding houses I there is but little inconvenience from the practice.

The fumes, therefore, do I not reach the geueral current of the atmosphere, but descend of their owngravity into the well-like areaof the court, and are thus a source of considerable discomfort.

Somo representation of the affairs of the bank was necessary, and those representations were made to Mr. Brockwell beause they were made to the blic, whom the bank were endeavonring to Induce to take the new shaTes. (' Meues Case," 2, De G Mac. and Gord. 506 ) The directors were theagents of the then existing shareholderm. Either the orignal shareholders had or had not the maeans of discovering the real state of the bank; if they had, they were thepersons who only ought to suffer. If they had not, and wera bound by- contract not to inquire, they had left the whole =atter to the' directors, and must suffer egually as if having tho power, they hsa neglected to use it. The dlis. tfnction for some time made between the provisiona com. |mitteeman and allottee had been long awept away, bit here there was no question inter se, but as b,eteen the new sbareholder anc the company. Upon this qnestion of liability to) credltors bedg suffielentto war put upon the list, thero was no case where a person secondarily liable had been putupon the ist. Sutton's Case 3, Die Ge, Sma, 262.) Asumping tht Brockwell was liable to careditors, tis being only a secondary liability, he was not now lable. If the first cLas failed there maght be such a casoe as a subsidiary w-inding-up, but no such case had ever existed. The reason was obviou, for it would be a mere waste of public time and money to investgatef: case wblch could not arise, for the parties primarily liable were liable forall the debts of the company. The VrxE-CHeaox=On asked whether there were in. stances of a double list ? 1r. SB LwN said that there had been cases where parties had been PTt on the lst as to time, but not llability.'(" Gin ger's Case 2, Irish Jurist, N. S., 224.) Assuming lia bility to creditors and contribution inter ae, there was no instance ef a person secondarily liable being put ponthe lis, upon he authoriy of Sutton's Case," because there were others primrily liable. There avas, moreover, no evidence to show that any other person stood in thesame position as Mr. Brockweli; snd it was a caeo of personal liability, which coud not be enforced for this purpose. It was _ ;iZO wiaUnVe LLOs a; one ana tue same tine wthout cOncu4rrece, so many of, the judges sioulj have arrived at the same conclusbion. The evidece as to Mr. Brockwell's connexion as depositor at the hank showed that from time to time he inspected the balance-sheets which were issed, and, in fulU faith and belief of theetruth of such statements, he became a shareholder. Mr. Brock. well, moreover, not having received an answer to his application for shares in February, in March received a prospectus, containing a representation in confirmation of the balance-sheets, The supplementary deed was executedl on the same faith and belief. The learned connsel then continued to read and comment upon Mr. Esdaile's further evidenco, which in substance went to confirm the statements mado by the evidence in chief. These proceedings under the Vinding-up Acts were not by creditors, bat a suit by one shareholder for contribution. "The National Exchanee Company of Glas ow" (2 Mracqueen) had in fact cettled the law with regard to the power and lisbility of directors of joint-stock companies, and there was no doubt that under the 18th section of the charter of this bank this esse came within the principle there laid down.

The bill was filed by the plaintiff on behalf of himself and all others the shareholders in tho bank, the defendants being Mr. Roebuck, IMP., the governor, and Mr. Clack, the manager. The bank was incorporated by charter the lIst of May, 18M having existed provisionally from an earlier period, with a deed containing the usual clauses as to the powers and meetings of the court of directors, &e., with power to provide asuperannua. tion fund for the general xm nager after 20 years sertice, and not to exceed two-thirds of the salary. There were also elauses respecting the mode of affixing the cororate sel to documents, &c. It appeared that lMfr. Clack had been manager of the Union Bank of London and others for 32 years, and negotiations were entered into with him to take the management of the Western. Bsank which resuted in February, 1856, In an agreementthat he sbould bave 1,M500l per annum for his rerices as general msnager, with fbrmtvre, to be provided by hin at the expense of the bank; and it was povided by the agreement that in case the bank should ail within seven Te or, In case of ill health, &c., he should not continue his office, he shouldl receive for threo years the sum of 1,0007. in each of those Tear, this agement to be embodied in a more fornial document.

Justice WxuLS and a Speciah Jury.) WOODS'V. MAY. This was an action of slander, tho allegation in the declaration being that the defendant had maliciously and falsely charged tho plaintiff with having committed wilful and corrupt perjury. The defendant pleaded a justification. Mr. Bovill, QC.(, and Mr. Hawkins, were counsel for the plaintiff; Berjeant Shee and Mr. Prentice were for the defendant. This cause commenced on Tuesday, and occupied the Court until late in the evening, when it was adjourned. The facts were somewhat complicated, and were also of an unusual character. The plaintiff and the defendant are both attornys, the former practising in partnership with a gentleman named Dempster at Brighton, and the latter also having formerly practised at Brlghton, but who is now carrying on his profession in London. It appeared that in the year 1855 a person named Roberts, who carried on the business of a horsedealer and riding master at Brighton, and had two establishments in the town, was desirous to dispose of one of them, and a person named Charles Pool, who at that time was engaged as a cattle dealer at Rinomer, near Lewes, agreed to purchase one of Roberts's establishments, ard after some negotiation an arrangement was come to that he was to pay Roberts 1,0001. for stock and goodwill, butupon the understandingthat only 1001..was to in money, amd that thoremaining 9001. was to be secuzredby a deed and bill of sale of the stock, furniture, &c. The present plaintiff Mr. Woods, acted as the attorney for both parties, and ie prepared a deed in conformity with the arrangement that had been come to between Pool andRoberts, and this deed was executed by the former in the month of June, 1855. By a recent statute it is necessary that all Instruments of this kind should be registered within 21 days, or otherwise they becomo void as against the general body of creditors, but it appeared that through some neglect in the office of the plaintiff, the deed was not registered in due course, and this led to the whole of the subsequent litigation and was also the cause of the present action. It appeared that in order to cure the defect mn not registering the deed in time it became necessary that it should be re-exeouted, and on the 3d of October, 1855, the plaintiff, Mr. Woods, made an affidavit that on the previous evening Pool had re-executed the deed, and upon this aftidavit the deed was registered. In the month of October in the following year Roberts put in an execution under this deed upon the property of Pool, and seized and disposed of the whole of tt and tho uay after judgment had been entered Pool Lm self proceeded to London and made a declaration of insolvency, evidently with the object of preventing Roberts from taking the whole of the proper to the exclusion of the other creditors; and Mr. May, the defendant, was appointed the solicitor to the assignees. Mr. Woods, the plantiff, in the course of the proceedings that subsequently took place before Mr. Commi6sioner Evans in the Bankraptcy Court, was called as a witness, and he swore that between 7 and 8 o'clock on the evening of the 2d of October he went to the private residence of Mt. Pool, in Norfolk-square, Brighton, and that he was asked into the parlour and there saw Mr. Pool, and that he at that time re-execnted the deed In question by writing with a dry pen over the former signature, and that he himself did the same to his own signature as the attesting witness ; the object of this evidence being to establish the validity of the deed, and enable Mr. Roberts to sustain his claim to the property under it to the exclasion of the other creditors of PooL It will 6b unnecessary to detail all the various proceedings that subeequently took place, and it wi be sufficient to state that-Pool himself subsequently underwent an examination in the Court of Bankruptcy, when he positively contradicted the statement made by Mr. Woods, and, as the result, Poole obtained a first-class certificate, and the Commissioner made an order that Mr. May should bring an action against Roberts on behalf of the assignees of Pool, to recover back the money he had obtained under the deed by the sale of Pool's property. An action was subsequently commenced against Roberts, but It appeared that he declined to contest the validity of the deed, and handed over the proceeds of the propertyo be divided among the general body of Pool's creditors, While these proceedings were going on, it appeared that the defendant had sent a report of the proceeaings that took place in the Bankruptcy Court, and In which there was an allegation that Mr. Woods had made a false statement with reference to the alleged re-execution of the deed on the 2d of October, to the Brighton HeraZd newspaper,which reports were inserted, and it also appeared that the defendant had distinctly stated to Mr. Faithful, a solicitor at Brighton, and other persons, that Mr. Woods. in the evidence he gave before the Commis- aionor in Bankruptcy, had bLoa .Sni*- of ilfl 'u and was liable to be transported, and also that he was not sure he should not indict him for it. It was upon these statements that the present action was brought, and the defendant now pleaded that he was justified in making the statements he had done respecting the plaintiff Mr. A. W. Woods, the plasntiul; was thefirst witness examined, and, baving narrated the circumstances connected with the orginal execution of the deed in June, 1855, he said that upon finding the registration had not been performed in conformity with the statute, he repeatedly applied to Pool to come to his office to re-execute the deed, and upon finding that he did not do so he went betweea 7 and 8 o'clock in tho evening of the 2d of October, 185I , to his house in Norfolk-square, accompanied by his clerk, Mr. Dempster. He was told that Pool was at home, and he went into the parlour leaving Mr. Dempster outside, and he produced the deeo, and Pool wrote with a dry pen over his old signature, and delivered the instrument as his act and deed in the usual formal manner. He said that he at once proceeded to his office and drew up an affidavit stating the circumstances under which the deed had been re-execated, and this was engrossed by his clerk, and on the following day he went before the Master and swore to the truth of the contents of the affidavit, and the deed was finally registered on the 9th of October. In answer to questions put by Mr. Serjeant SE, the plaintiff said that he acted as the attorney for Roberts during the proceedings in bankruptcy, and the effect of establishing the validity of the deed would have been that he would have received tho whole amount of his claim upon Pool, instead of receiving a dividend only, and that Roberts had threatened to bring an action against him to recover the balance of his debt on account of his negligence in not originally registering the deed in question in proper time. He also said that It was his own opinion that the deed was perfectly valid, and Mr. Roberts aoted against his advice in not defendingthe action brought against him by the assignees to set it aside. The plaintiff likewise said that on the evening to which he referred the door was opened by a female servant, and he had made inquiries in all directions to discover her and bring her forward as a witness, but he had been unable to do so. Mr. Dempster, the gentleman referred to by the plaintiff as having accompanied him to Pool's house on the evening of the 2d of October, was then examined, and he stated that he remained outside while Mr. Woods went in, and thatwhen he came out he distinctly saw Pool accompany him to the door and remain talking to him a short time, and that Mr. Woods, when he returned, told him that Pool had ve-execnted the deed, and on the same evening he engrossed the affidavit that had been drawn up by Mhr.Woods. Mfr. G. Faithful, solicitor, of Brighton, proved the conversation he had with the defendant, and that he said in reference to the proceedings that had taken place in the Court of Bankruptcy, " The fact is, Woods perjured himself." In answer to a question put by Mr. Serjeant SE, Mr. Faithful said that Mr. May did not express himself with any anger towards Mr. Woods, but appeared rather to be sorry for what had occurred. The words he made use of were thathehad " caught himonthe hop" at the Bankruptoy Court and put him Ain the witness box before he had an opportunity of looking at his papers or refreshing his memory, and that the fact was he had perjured himself. Some correspondence which had passed between the attorney for the plaintiff and the defendant was then put in, from which it appeared that an offer had been made to the defendant to discontinue the action upon his paying the costs and withdrawing the plea of justification, but ho declinedto do so, and said that going on with the action could only injure the character of the plaintiff, as he was prepared to prove all he had stated, and the result could not affect him, for even if the plaintiff did succeed in obtaining a farthing damages his character maust be destroyed by the investigation. This closed the plaintiff's case. Mr. Serjeant SE E then made a most eloquent and powerful speech to the jury on behalf of the defendant. He said that the issue between the parties on the present occasion was undoubtedly one of a very painful character, but his client, from the instructions he had received. ann ~ .dthein formation that had come to his knowledge, felt that he was justified in the course he had taken, and could not, as a man of honour, withdraw from the lnquiry, and that the oni counrse he could pursue was to lay before the jury the evi dence he had obtained in reference to the matter they were Inquiring into, and leave them to decide upon which side the ruthlay.He hen aid t woldhe useless to disguise ~the fact that if his witnesses were speaking the trnth the jury could only come to one conclusion-namely, that Mr. Woods, in order to screen himself from the conse- quences of his original neglect, had wilfully made a false statement when he was examined in the Court of Bankruptcy, his object evidently being to shield himself from the consequences of having an action brought against him by Mr. Roberts for his negligence in not having the deed registered in proper time, and he said that if he should make out this to the satisfaction of the jury the defendant would be entitled to a verdict. The learned serjeant then proceeded to comment upon the other facts in the case, and particularly called the attention of the 'urv to the circumstance of MJr. Roberts declining to attempt to support the validity of the deed which was supposed to secure to him a sum of 900..; and he said it was clear he would nothave taken this course if he had not thought there was something wrong in connexion with the instrument and that he could not sustain it. Mr. Q. Pool was called, and he stated that he had never executed anfy other deed than the one that was placed befoe hm fr tat urpse n te mnthof June, 1855'andwit reardto hatwasrepesetedtohave occurred on he vemg o th 2dof ctoer,he swore positively that nothing of the st tHe sid that what wascaled he mal shep air atewes was held on thatday whch e hd no misedattndig for 20 years, and he left his house at Brighton *bout 1 olok, and rode on horseback to Iewes, and remained there till the evening, when he met a relative namled Payne, who Invited hDIj to Ringmer, and they went there in a fly and passed the evening with Payne and other persons at the Anchor ablinhouse, nd he mept at Pynals, and did not return to Brighton until 8 okclock on the following momiun. IIe also stated that on the 2a of october his house ln orfolksquare was occupied by lodgers, and he wa.s himself living at Roberts's, and it was therefore im posible that he could have executed the deed In hhi parlour unider the circum stances stated by the plaintiff. This witness was subjected to a very severe cross-exami. nation by Mr. BOVIL, and in the course of it at first denied that he had made inquiries as to the day on which he was supposed to have been at lewes aud at Bingmer but he subsequently admitted that he mlght have made sucn inquiries, but said that they were only In reference to his own action against Roberts, and they had nothing todo with the present triaL He also said there was another sheep fair at Lewes on the 21st of September, but he was sure that the occurrences he had spoken to took place on the 2d of October. He said he had no business to transact at the fair, and he did not make a bmarin of any kdnd, and he was anable to give the name of any person who saw him in the fair on the 2d of October. He sent for a fli to convey him to Ringmer, but he did not know where it came from or who was the driver. He also denied most positively that Mr. Woods had ever asked him to re-execute the deed, and sid he should not have done so if he had, as he had been deceived entirely with regard to the effect of it, and had no idea that it gave a power to seize the whole of his property. It appezred that he had obtained a first-class certificate, and that he was now on friendly terms with Roberts, and that Roberts had lent him money to assist hlm In curyig on business again t Brighton. Miss Ellen Pool, the sister of the last witness, was then examined, and she statedthat onthe 2d ofOctober, 1855 the lower part of the house in Norfolk-square was occuplea by lodgerst and that she remembered her brother gOing to the sheep fair at Bewes, and did not recollect seeing him n y part of the day; and she also said that no one couldahave come t the house between 7 and 8 in the evening of the 2d of October without her knowing it, and she was sure no one Several other witnesses were called, who spoke to seeing Pool at Ringmier on a certain evening about the month of October, but, on cross-examination, they were unable to speakwith any certainty as to the particuiar day. Mr. Bovmu, at the close of the case for the defendant, called another witness, samed Shears, a fly driver, who stated that upon a Lewes sheep fair day, shortly after the arrival of the train from Brighton, the witness Pool came out of the railway station, and hired his fly to drive him to Ringmer. It was shortly after 8 o'clock in the evening -when this occurrd. Mr. Serjeant SuEW having summed up the case of the defendant, Mr. BOVILL made a most able reply upon the whole case, Ee said that before the jury could return a verdict for the defendarit they must, after the evidence that had been laid before them, not only come to the conclusion that Mr. Woods had been guilty of the crimes of perjury and fraud, but that he had also committed forgery, for if thisdeed were not re-executed on the 2d of October it was undoubtedly a forged instrunent. He asked the jury, however, to look at all the facts of the case, and at the demeanour of the witnesses who had been examined on both sides, and he said ho felt satisfi2d that when they had done so they would feel no diffculty in coming to the conclusion that the evidence for the defeudant could not be relied on, and that-he had altogether failed iu making out the justification he had placed unpon the record. JusticeW ee then summed up the whole cae with great care and impartiality, and The jury, after a very short deliberation, returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 7501.
IfMTA2Th arRon T -NOTTlNGHAM, JuLY 20. URXOWN VOURT.- (Before .2fr. Justice Ep.x.) John Mew, aged 24, shoemaker, and Isaac James, 19, lacemaker, were indicted for violently assaulting Josepl Simpson, with intent to steal his moner Mr. Beasley prosecuted, and Mr. Bell defended. The prosecutor in this case, being employed by one of the large lace manufacturers of this town to collect money, was walking along one of the streets of the town in the midday of the 17th of ApriL carrying in one hand a basket containing a considerable quantity of copper money, and in the other sUver, to the amount altogether of about 401., when he was attacked by the two prisoners, the elder of whGm struck him a violent blow on the back with a very formidable life-preserver, and an attempt was made to get his money from him. The blow occasioned a serious spinal injury, but Simpson was not at the time so far disabled by it as to revent him from offering resistance, and he succeeded i keeping possession of the property untfl the risoners, alarmed by his cries for assistance, made of Sy They were, however, followed and secured. The jury having returned a verdict of Guilty, and a pre. vious conviction having been proved against New, the learned Judge sentenced him to 15 years' penal servitude - but James, who appeared previously to have borne a good character, was sentenced to three years' only. Samuel Chambers, aged 51, labourer, was lndlted for wounding Elizabeth Walker, with intent to murder her, and in another count with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. Mr. Merowether prosecuted, and Mr, Bell defended. It appeared that the prisoner had cohabited for nearly 20 years with a woman named Eliza Smith, and that she had for three or four days previous to the 4th of June taken Elizabeth Walker. On the morning of that day he had plied to the latter, who was a woman of advanced age, for permission to see Eliza Smith, but she had refused, and had closed the door against him. He then threatened to do for them both before night, and, having provided himself with a hammer, he did, in point of fact, in the course of the same aternoon go again to the house of the prosecutrix and strike her a violent blow on the back of the head with the hammer. She 'ded bleeding towards a neighbour's house, but so great was the terror produoed by the pri. soner's violence that the woman who lived there fastened the door against her, aud the proseoutrlx was obliged to seek reftge elsewhere. sane, however, soon came, and the prlsonerhaving been seized by one man, another with diffiulty succeeded in getting the hammer from him; but before this could be done he had, in addition to the wound on the wroman's head, which penetrated nearly to the bone, inalicted a severe bruise on each shoulder. During this scene the prlsoner, who wPas to sorue extent excited by drink, used very brutal expressions of a determination to kill the prosecutrix; but the jury only found him Guilty upon the count which charged an intent to do grievous bodily harm; and the learned Judge sentenoedhirn to 10 years Imprisoment. Mary Ann Leaves]ey, aged 33, charwoman, was convicted of administering ergot of rye, with intent to procure abor. tion; and was sentenced to 12 months' penal servitude. Several charges of rape were tried during the day, but aU resulted in acquittals, and in one case the grand jury Ignored the bilL. JurY 21. CROWN COuT.-(Before Mr. Justice Cnssswxn.) Sophia Hodson, aged 31, was indicted for the wilful murder of Joseph Hodson, at South ColliUghama, on the 22d of March last. Mr. Bodeu and MIr. Brlstowe conducted the case for the prosecution; 2U. O'Brien and Mr. Cockle defended the prisoner. The deceased was an old man in his 72d year, and of penurious habits. Hle was uncle to the prisoner's husband, who lived only a short distance from the deceased, at South Cellingham, in this county. The old man was possessed of some property, *nd was at the tine of his death about to leave Nottinghamshire and go to live inYorkshire, where a brother of his own resided, who had spent the greater pas of last winter with the deceased, and had only returned home about a fortnight before his death. That event took place suddenly on Sunday, the 22d of March last. The de. ceased hved entirely alone, and was found on the morning of that day sitting in a chair in the kitchen of his house, with his chin restig on his breast, looking as if he were asleep, but, in truth, quite dead. In a drawer in the same room was found a portion of a mincepie, which was afterwards discovered to be full of arsenio, and the result of the medical examination which took place left no doubt that the old man's death bad been caused by arsenic which hehad takenby eatingpart of themincepie. Thewayin which that mincepie reached the deceased clearly appeared. On the Wednesday before, a boy had left it at the Queen's Head Newark, sx miles distant from Collingham, to be forwarded to the latter place by the ordinary carrier. At that time it was wrapped in brown paper, addressed on the outside "Mr. Joseph Hodson, South Collinghamn." There it re. mained till Saturday, when it was delivered to the Colling. ham carrier, who took it to the homse of the deceased, but, not fndinghim at home, carried it on to the prisoner's house, he knowing that her husband was related to the de. ceased; and on the Saturday evening the prisoner took lit and gave it to the old man, to whom it was delivered in the same state as when it was left at the Queen's Head, at Newark; for the brown paper was afterwards found in the house of the deceased. Who the boy was, by whom the parcel was left at the Queen's Head was unknowu. No evidence at all had been otained to connect the prisoner with that boy. It was roved that she had been over to Newark on the WednesSay, but it appeared that her mother and married sister lived there, and she had been to seethem and to take one of them some greens. There was evidence indeed that she had purchased arsenic at a chymist's at Newark, but that was on the 8th of December; and on that occasion she went to a shop where she was known and signed her own 'name in the book. The chymit had sold it to her though she was unaccompanied by any other per. son, and stated that she told him that it was for a neighbour named Storr. Whereupon he entered in his book Storr as the purchaser, and allowed the prisoner to sign as a witness-a course of proceeding which the learned judge reprobated as an evasion of the statutory regulation. An attempt was also made to show that the address uion the brown paper parcel -was in the handwriting of the jni. soner, but to establish that only one witness was caled-a police officer who had no knowledge of her handvwiting, except that which he had derived from seeing her write once since the death of the decea5ed, and since suspicion had attached to her-namely, when, for the purposes of this Investigation, sle had written some. thing by the coroner's request. The learned JUDGE held that, under these circumstances, the witness was not an admissible witness upon the question of handwriting; and he also ruled that, in the absence of all other evidence, the jury were not at liberty to consider the question of handwriting by comparing for themselves the writing on the brown paper with the prisoner's signature in the chynist's book. The evidence as to the writing being out of the case, B failed altogether; and The learned JUDGE told the jury that it would be a mere waste of time to go on further with the case, as there was really no evidence at all to connect the prisoner with the sendmg of the mincepie. A verdict of Not Guilty was accordingly taken. The prisoner and her husband, against both of whom the coroners jury had found a verdict, were then arraied Upor the coroners uquisition, and, no evidenc being eiferqp a vftdi of0go GuW1, was taken, and they wer both diaharged CIm SIDE-(Before Mr. Justice ERLz and a Commn Mr. Justice 1ERLr after dispcslng of the rema n[n cu In the town calendar, with te assilace of Ur. elor, Q.CI, who sat in te uidlillcomenced the civil bus- HOLME V.

Munckton, coroner for West Somerset, on the body of Mary Ann Arscott, an aged widow residing in Mary-street, Taunton, who died on the preceding Saturday from the effects of an overdose of laudanum, taken for tincture of rhubarb. The deceased discovered her mistake immediately after she had swallowed the poison on Friday morning. Mr. Welsh, surgeon, was at once called in, and emetics and other means were employed to counteract the effects of the laudantim. She, however, fell into a state oE stupor, and died about 5 o'lock on Saturday morning. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased died from the effects of polson administered by herself in mistake. JIhPING ON A TRAIN IN MorroN.-On Monday, at the Wakefield Petty Sessions, Mr. Christopher Ellit a farmer near Barnsley. was charged with havng jamped on to one of the Lancashire and Yorkshire trains, wich was leaving for Barnsley. He was fined 11. 10s. NAVAL PR Im ONEY.-The receipt of naval prize, bounty, salvage, sad other moneys during the year ended the 31st of March last amounted to 88,951., and the payments to 48,270h, leaving a balance of 40,681L The amount distributed or paid away in the year 1856-57 on account of captures made under the "Prize Act (Russia)" amounted to 72,0551, and the balance on the 1st of April last was 30.2301. A.N ENCaIERED ESTATE.-It would be hopeless to attempt a description of theconfueion intowhichthe property had been brought by Mr. Rigg's extraordinary system of management. The boundaries of the farms were unsettled; the land was full of squatters, many of whom had been tenants and had been ejected by the landlord. These interlopers of course paid no rent, and were omitted from the rental or list of tenants and farms which the owner gave in for my use and guidance as receiver. This documentalso contamed a statement of the arrears of rent due, and, as might be expected, made no mention of the moneys which many of the tenants had advanced in the name or under the pretence of fnes and loans; and in most cases there was a suppression of the agreement to grant leases in consideration of these advances. Utterly vain was the effort to arrange such complicated accounts, or to reconcile the reclamations of the tenants with the obstinate demands of the landlord. Ini those days the Court of Chancery seldom abated rents or remitted arrears, and was slow to adopt any unusual seps in the conduct of the affairs of an estate, unless with the con. sent of the inheritor or owner. In this case the inheritor would conseht to nothing; with a proper amount of vigour and activity on the part of the receiver all arrears could easily be got in. After this hint of what I was to expect if I should betray a weak compassion for the poor tenants, or' any sickly distaste for the task appointed me of grindiing them to the dust, I ateeled my resolution and buckled on myarmoar for the crusade against the rebellioas vassals Of Bagbnly,-DiNe7n'g Houscho4 ow r,

MTAIlRtBO1G3i-STRwE -Abraham Lev Goodman, charged as the keeper ofabettng house, No. , Coventry. street, and Charle W.Seat, doorkeeper, with 13 otherpersona found In the house when the polico made an entry, were brouglht before MSr. BrruIUa3 for final examination. The defendants w ere remanded from the previous exaia ton, in order to glve time to lr. Bingham to consider his judgment, the proceedings being under a new Act of Parlia. Mr. BI:NG A--The defendants, Goodman and Stew were lbrought to this court onthe 15th of July, chaed with keeling and using a room for the purpose of unlawful gaming. Itappared ta the room In question wasaninner apartment, after Eassdng through ashop, over the door of whchwanstheInscription, "Abraham Goodman, lioensed dealer in tobacco;" that for the last two months, during which the shop had been watched, little tobacco, or none had been sold- and that no stock of tobacco was found when tne pollco entered on the 15th. At half-past 1 that morning a policeman tapped at the shop door. Goodman's son came out through the door of the inner apartment Into the shop, and, seeing the police through the window, Instead of advancing to open the door retreated to the inner apartment. The shop door was forced by the police, who, proceeding to the Inner apartment, found taere 15 ersons, some of them asmokin ci thez had brought wit them, and Goodman with a dice-box an diceinhishand,& a bajammon board being before him. eqveraS it of dice were found In the *oartment and adjoining snop, together with some dirty cards. A table In the arent was covered with three cloths, one of them naile on to it, and a curtain prevented any view from the shop Into the apartment. The persons assembled had entered in the course of the three or four hours preceding the visit of the polce, and none of them had purchased in the shop any tobacco or cigars. One of the visitors, who had frequented the place, brought a stranger with him, who was not admitted till the introducer vouched him as a friend. Three of the 15 persons taken into custody were called as witnesses under the Act of the 17th and 18th of Victoria, cap. 38, which has recently come into operation. Two of them said they had arrived only half an hour before the entrance of the police, and that during that time nothing was played but backgammon, which isnot an unlawful game. The third refused to be examined, and preferred to submit to the penalty of a reonsant witness. By the 8th and 9th of rictoria, chap. 109 where any dice, tables, or other instruments of gaming are' Iound I any house suspected to bo used as a common gaming house, It shall be evidence, until the contrary be made to appear that such house Is used as a common am5ng house. ow, dice having been found in Goodman's nouse, suspected tobe used as a common gaming house, has he madethe contrary of that suspicion appear 7Assuming that backgammon was pLayed for half an hour or thereabouts out of the three or four hours duringwhich the comny was assembled, that circumstance seems to me to contirm rather than to negative the inference which the statute compels a magistrate to draw from the finding of dice in a suspected house. It is difficult to conceive kow 15 persons could play backgammon with one board, while it is obvious that two persons might be so employed as a blind for 10 or 12 others enaged ata n unlawful game upon a table well muffled with a trile covering And that the house was not unjustly suspecte sufficiently appears from the shop front announcing a business not conducted In earnest, from the retreat of tho son into an inner room on the sight of the polihe, fromthe mnffled table as wel as the dice found in that room, from the hesitation to admit a stranger till vouched for by a friend, and from the refusal, even under penalty, of the most respectable of the persons apprehended to give evidence. The punishment for the offence of keeping a common gaming house is a fine not exceeding 5001. or imprisonment not exceeding one year, at the discretion of the magistrate. As Goodman is here for the first time, andas the comp.ny assembled in his house consisted not of minors, apprentices, or servants, whoare too freguently tempted by the facilties of such houses to make froeewith their employera' proprty, but was composed of veteran idlers, who perhaps mlght be left to compass each other's ruin without much loss to society, a fine of 501. only will, as a commencement, be imposed on Goodman, and 10L on Stewart, who acted as doorkeeper. In default ofta ment Goodmaan to be imprisoned six weeks, Goodman said, there were several backgammon boards in his house when the police entered. ifr.; Lewis said, the deciion would be appealed against, xbmid It anlA he fnr the magistrate to fix the amount of BaM for Goodman was fixed at two sureties In 1001. each. The other defendants were discharged. Johurwilliain Taylor and William James Handley were charged with being found In a common gaming house, No. 24, Little Newport-street. The defendant Taylor wa fied 301. for keepIng and Handley for assisting in keeping a betting house. They intimated their intention to appeaL. Bow-sTnsr.-George Frederick Carpenter, aged 18, was charged with destroying upwards of 80 post-office letters. The prlsoner was employed as an auxilary letter-carrier at Woolwich, and from the statement of Mr. Peacock, the Post-office solicitor, it appeared that many of the letterEs destroyed in mere wantonness to save himself the trouble of delivering them, were of the utmost importance. Two or three of them were addressed to the relatives of some of the unnappy sufferers by the late accident on the NorthRentRailway, conjurng them to come instantly to the hospitalto take leave of theirafllicted friends. Another letter contained a summons from the Thames Police-office against a person residing at Woolwich, who had been since apprehended on a warrant and brought up in custody in consequence of his supposed neglect to appear to the sum. mnons. James Howker, a cowkeeper at Woolwlcb, stated that he was walking by Wellaley-house pond on Sunday afternoon ladt, when he saw a bundle of letters floating upon the water. He fished it out, and found that there were about 44 letters, much torn. He took out the letters, and not being able to read himself carried them home after laying the envelopes on the common to dryin the sun. Mr. Bxxy.-That was an odd mode of drying them, Tbh might have been all blown away. litrness.-But the wind was contraryways, and I thought the inside of the letters was the most important. (A laug1h) It was proved that a police sergeant, 37 R, proceeded to the common on Monday morning in consequence of information communicated by last witness, and there found 44 envelopes, corresponding with the letters produced. Four or five envelopes were missing. One of the letters contained a Post-office order for 30s. Mr. Sculthorpe, Deputy-Controller, deposed to an amission made by the prisoner that he had thrown the letters into the pond, after tyingthem to a stone. He was fond of books, and confessed that his only object in destroying the letters gven to him for dellvery was to have more time for reading. He was studying James's life of a convied when apprehended. About 30other letters were found in his possesslion. The prisoner was committed for trial. CLRRErwxra..-Thomas Smith, John Warren, and Thomas Bennet, who stood remanded on the charge of stealing a quantity of lead fromtheGreat Northern Railway, were brought up,and the depositions having been read over, the priSoners were committed for triaL. LkAMD .-Mathew Longman, a dyer by trade, andwho has been before committed from this court and convicted of a similar offence, was finally examined on a charge of obtaining 81. from a person named Jennings by fraud and false pretences. From the testimony of the prosecutor It appeared that in consequence of an advertisement which he sawin a morning aper he apli ed to the prisoner, who then lived at No. 54, ork-road, beth, and appeared to carry on the trade of a orer. on that occasion the prisoner represented that he hadlived in the homse for 30 years, that he carried on an extensive business and had a large connexion, and offered to teach hiu (the prosecutor) the " arts and mysteries" of the dying trade provided he paid him 101. down. lHe (the prosecutor) could only manage to scrape ol. together, and this the prisoner agreed to take, and further promised to pay the prosecutor lOs. a-week. The prosecutor remained for some weeks, during which he received 21., but, perceiving that he bad not the most remote chance of acquiring the slightest knowledge of the dyeing trade, as there were only a few old tubs and broken pots and pans in the place, and that, in fact, his money had been obtained from him by false representations, he became importunate, and ultimately gave the prisoner into custody. In reply to a question from the Magistrate the witness said that the prinipal work he had to do while at the place of the prisoner was washing a few blankets and rugs. Mr. Webb said that 12 months ago the prisoner took the house 54, York-road, from him, representing that he re- quired it to carry on the business of his trade as a dyer, and rom that time to the -present he had only paid one quarter's rent, though in the time ho must have received at least 301. from the lodgers. Witness called at the shop from time to ime for his rent, and from what he had observed he belioved that little or no businss was done there, ass the part of the house occupied by the prisoner was in a most wretched state, and without any furniture belonging to him. Pnsoner,-Do you recollect my -showing you my order- Mr. Webb.-Yes; and don't you recollect my telling you the orders In it were not genuin e? You recolleeb, also, that the references you gave me weie false, but, 'unfortunately, I neglected to inquire about them in time. Mdr. NoxRON.-What rent did he promise to pay for your house ?

SBE BOYA, A GRIOULTURAL ,:OCIETY. MIEETING AT SALISBURY. The bafiness of the great annual gathering of farmers, | breeders, and agricultural machinists opened on liEiday last I *with the trials of implements for which przes wae offered. T,ho rapidly increasing number of mechanicat *aids to >>uss bandry having necessitated a remodelling ef the so'A6ty's zystem of. premiums, a classification has beean adopted, aud the prizes for each class of implemuents ox e now competed f.r triennially, instead of every year. At Chelmfsord the trials were of ploughs, harrows, cleo- rulshers, cultivators, and other implements used in prepareo.rv tillage ; this year they are of drills, horse hoes, hay 'machines, horse rakes, reaping and moving machines. 'carts and waggOns, and ether apparatus employed in the cultivation and harvesting of crops. And irx addition to these are the expeziments with steam p loughs and steam caltivaaors, to which the public, exOit' A. by the novelties produced at Chelmsford, has for a long time looked forward withlarge expectation. The show this year wilL bear comparison with any that Ihave preceded it. Bothx implement and cattle yards are weU stocked. Among tb e crowd in the former of course we mneet with many whict 'nave -eased to be novelties to th farming world for 'eomne time, yet as a whole thi portion of the exhib-ti on is well sustained, and the absence of many mew inventio ns compensated by the improvements and consequent inrs'ased efficiency of the old. The cattle yard is perhaps the: greatest feature, and each of the chief divisions of farmin g stock is represented by most numerous pens of first-clasnzanimals. The attendanco of visitors at the show has not, jwevcr, been quite commensurate withits attractions. IS may well be that the agricultural public have been* h0dL:ing offuntil to-day, when the price of admission throbglxrut all the yards is reduced to half-a-crown, but the fact, liem3rtheless, remains the same, and except among the stai;chlpatrons of the farm there has been a decrease in the autzdance. Yesterday was very probably the best day of tle show, for his Royal Highness the Prince Consort expressly came up from Osbomne to inspect It, and his visit maturally induced a rush on the part of the public to be preeent also. Knowingthestrong fnterestwhich hisRoyal Highness takes in all relating to the progress of agriculture, and as some of the stock from the model farm at Windsor are conspicuous among the best animals in the present show, the managing members of the society begged that the Prince would honour the exhibition with a visit. The request, we believe, was also backed by a similar entreaty from the mayor (Mr. Pain) and the Town Council of Salisbury. His Royal Highness at once conEented, but on theexpress condition that the visit should be considered strictly private-that is to say, without any of the usual tedious ceremonial of long addresses, &o. The town of Salisbury, however, having but few opportrunities of welcoming Royalty, was'determined not to pass over the visit as a mere private visit. A decorative spirit therefore got abroad, and prevailed more or less extensively throughout the place. Streets were swept, windows bedizened, and old houses made to revel in prismatic colours. To metropolitan eyes the display of course -was nothing very startling, but for such a smaU place it was really very good, and, wlhat u-as more to the purpose, generally speaking tastefuL Triumphal arches were attempted, and in some cases with success. Of course, with one or two you required to keep steadily in mind the object with which they had been erected, and, taking the will for the deed, at least to pardona their inventors. One bad an appalling caricature of the national quadruped crouched amid thick evergreens, as if about to spring into an alehouso near at hand, but tho rest wero geperaily good, and made up in laurels what they wanted in design, for their timbers at least were concealed. Pdarket-street by a most simple expedient had been con. verted into a very pretty thoroughfare. Small fir trees were clofely planted on each side of the road, so as to make it resemble a shady boulevard, and with its flags and banners and crowds of people it presented a rather striking appear. ance. The streets in the town were pretty well thronged at an early hour, though there was nothing very inviting in the aspect of the weather. It always threatened, and often did much more, coming down with those heavy showers which generally usher in holydays in England. However desirable this watery accessary might have been in an agricultural point of view, it was unquestionably disagreeable as an adjunct to the show, and even the most in-vetexate farmers wished i' vell away. Fortunately, before the arrival of his Rtoyal Highness, the clouds cleared off, and the remainder of the day was all that could be desired. His Rloyal Highness arrived at Salisbury at half-past 12 o'clock. Mr. C. S. hMortimer accompanied the train, and Colonel Hood and Captain the Hon. Dudley de Ros were in attendance on thePrinco. TheBishop of Salisbury, theHon. RtalphDutton, MX.P., and the mayor and town-council, intheirrobesof office, -were in waiting at the station, and after a few brief words of welcome from tho mayor, which the Prince courteously acknowledged, his Royal Highness entered his carriage. During the route through the town, and, indeed, up to the door of the cattld-yard, a very warm recoeption was accorded to the illustrious visitor. At the door of tb' ,--a . _ Lora lortman, acting for the President of the Society; Mr. W. Miles, M.P., late President; Mr. Gibbs, the director; Mr. S. Johmas, the stewart of the yard; Mr. Hudson, secretary; and the principal officials of the society received his Royal Highness. The cattleyard was rigidly closed tovisitorsuntiltbe judgesshould have finished their awards, so that his Royal Highness was enabled to examine the contents of each pen at his leisure. With the magnificent display of horses, more especially cart horses, his IRoyal Highness was much pleased, and remained near that portion of the show a considerable time. Tho pig-yard, which contains the largest and best assorted samples of breeds yet brought together, and the sheep pens, which are especially good in Southdown and Cotswolds, were nex visited. Unfortunately, a sad accident happened to an i-m equalled pen of Southdowns forwarded by the Duke of Richmond. While coming per rail the straw in their pen was ignited by a spark from the engine, and the poor animals so severely burnt as at one time to render their recovery doubtful and quite destroy their chance of the first arize The first and second prizes for sheep have both been taken by MLr. Jonas Webb. Among the shorthorns the prize has been awarded to Colonel Townley, the breeder of the celebrated bull " Butterfly," which last year fetched the enormous sum of 1,200 guineas for exportation to Australia. After the cattle, the implement yard was visited, and his I'Loyal Higbness remained some time inspecting each of the principal machines, to which we shall have occasion to aLlude hereafter. The Royalvisitterminatedat 3o'clock, whenthe Prince procoeded to the palace of the Bishop of Salisbury, and after partaking of lunch, returned to Osborne by special train. The sowing, hoeing, haymaking, and some other maChines have been tested on various fields, comprising about 22 acres, situate at Laverstock, and which had been cultivated in such a manner as to develope the special capabilities of the various implements. The curiosity among the horse-hoes is a turnip-thinner, exhibited by Messrs. Howard, In which the revolving cutters are attached upon discs on upright spindles, instead of on horizontal spindles, as in Huckvale's implement. Among haymnakers Nicholson's improvement of hollow boxes to the wheels, as shown at Chelmsford last year, has eclipsed the celebrated machine of Smith and Ashby. 'The trial of reapers took place upon a field of ripe rye, near the show yard, the style and expedition of the work assuring the light-land farmer that he need not suffer a single acre of corn to shake unreaped for lack of harvest men, as was extensively the case last year, and affording promise to the grower of heavy and storm-broken crops that he may yet hope to possess a machine able to shear without wasting, and to zave both expense and the more momentous matter of time in his laborious harvesting. Undoubtedly, the greatest novelty in this department, and one of the most nseritorioms and valuable pieces of machinery in the whole show, is the "Eagle " combined reaper and mower, invented by A. H. Ceryl, of Sandusky, Ohio, United States, and exhibited by .Ih-. Clayton, of the Atlas Works, Dorset-square, London, -In-'his machine we see just the simphcity of parts and consequent lightness, the small liability to derangement in working, and yet the greatest facility of accommodation to uneven: sur£fges of ground and irregular and tangled cropping vhich r-commend it as emphatically a tool for the farmer. The fraA-ing, of tho most compact description, is carried bybearings:npon the axle of the main carriage-wheel on the nearside of i,he machine, the horses yoked to a pole preceding it, while ,Oe driver is mounted on tho seat behind. By this arraugement and by the adjustment of the line of draught the weight is balanced, and the driver can elevato the front or cutting-edge 8 or 10 inches (so as to clear any obstacle or cyoai: a farrow)- by simply depressing the hind part with his foot. The objectionable side draught or thrust of most machines is in a great measure obviated by the fixing of the off sie small searriage-wheel somewhat forwarder than,jnsteadofzbreast of, the main wheel. The cutters are simple inform andconstruction, yetvery effective. They are acute, somewhat like Maissey'9s but sliding to and fro above the projecting "fingers," which are also sharp, and thus form shears or scissors. A si-ing bar presses the knives firmly in their places, and prevewts all clogging, and the vibrating motion of the cutter-bar 4s nuph slower than in other machines. In place of the spur-vdeels and pinions so mnltiplied and complex in most of our raapers there is here a neat arrangement of cams and slides, and not a, single cogged wheel to be found. It operates beautifully as a mowing machine for grass or oth r, crops, and when employed to resp white corn a carved platform is attached, on which a very ingenious yet simply-constructed automagtie rako collects and delivers the corn in sheaf-bandles in the -rar of the iwgclhine, ogt of thg way of thQ peit COursQ, This machine r7 celved the 200D. prize in Massachusetts, aftdt a three dayc trial, in 1856. As a mower it has gained te first Pr'e at Salisbury. Messrs. Burgess and KeY's resaper, wit1a the screw platform, and also an addition in the form 'of a revolving conical roller, wrapped with : s^rew in place of the old dividing-iron, to lay the up stauding corn upon. the machine, has been rewarded; as also Crosskill's Bell and Lord Kinnaird's. Dray's Hussey, with the tipping platform i which has generally been a favourite, at, considered as the ival of Burgess and Key's, has been distinguishned only with a commendation, the jadgos being resolved tupatronize the principle of a self-acting idelivery. The chief part of thie trials, with the excep, don of the steam-culture experiments, were concluded, on Saturday last. On Monday the stesm ploughs were ordered up to the large field purposely provided at Bishopsdown, on the crown of a hiUl not far from the show-yard. Mr. Burrell's locomotive traction engine, fitted with Boydel's Endless Railway, climbed thie ascent steNdily and with great power, dragging after it a tender holdiag 1,(000 gallons of water and carrying al the ploughs and tackle required. The boiler is an ordinary 8-horse power, with double cylinder engines, reversing motion, reducing gear-work, water-tank, shipsteerage, &o., as last year, and weighs when faully charged with water, 10 tons. Yet this enormous weight, with the 7 tons of load behind it, proceeded up an acolivity of one in 10 or 12, the inclination in one place being no less than one in seven. Mr. Fowler's 10-horse engine, weighing, wo suppose, about eight tons, and made to travel of itself upon wheels with broad peripheries, instead of being fitted with the endless-rails, was only able to ascend the hiU by anchoring a rope ahead and hauling up to the anchor, " veering" as it were and with a slow and laborious progress. Mr. Collinson Hall's traction engine, exeeedingly light and worked with steam of very great pressure, met with an accident in turning a most difficult and unreasonable corner, and entering a steep uphiUl gateway, and will be a day before the damage can be repaired. It appears to us hardly fair to subject these engines at their first public essay to such severe tests as directing them up aU sorts of awkward roads. That engine which may eseape unhurb owing to the dexterity of its driver is no more the best farmer's engine in consequenea than if it had vanquished another in a collision. MIr. Williams's two engines got up with the help of horses on Tuesday morning, and also Mr. Fowler's S-horse engine. Theploughingeommenced, after many delays, with Mr. Burrell's implements and traction engine, and proceeded amid great interruption from the crowding of the assembled lookers on. The problem of eteam-cultore, however, does not seem likely to be solved at Salisbury. The ground, although described as " light land," is so unsuited for clean, smooth ploughing (consisting almost of one part stiff earth to two of stones and gravel) that no good work is prac, ticable; and of the methods of actuating the implements perhaps there is not one free from considerable objections; and the feeling of the public appears to be that an amalgamation of the best points in several schemes might be more successful than any single one has yet been. Mr. Boydell's traction engine at first failed to plough in a businesslike manner, because Mr. Burrell's three double ploughs, attached beside aud behind it, cannot be properly guided, and therefore ran frequently out of work, necessitating continual stoppages and alterations of the draught chains. These ploughs being removed after the completion of the trial plot, and four of Howard's single-furrow plougbs attached, the work was better done. But the trials have fully demonstrated the great assistance which the " endless rails" are to a locomotive for farm roads and arable fields. Mr. CoUinson Hall's engine, fitted with the same rails, epresents the principle of obtaining a light locomotive by the employment of steam of very high pressure. For three years he has worked with steam of 3201b. per square inch, 'and havinga boiler of smal diameter and of peculiar form so as to preserve sufficient water over the tubes, in spite of steep gradients; his engine is just what we should suppose would be adapted for travelling over ploughed land. Weigh'. is required to obtain a " bite" for the endless rails, and this is secured by making the wheels heavy with metal. It is advisable to take advantage of the wholo weight of the engine for gaining a firm hold of the ground; and therefore both the main carriage wheels are driven by spunwheels geared from the crank-shaft. The steetage has not been made sufficiently powerful or under commaud; and perhaps farmers are not yet prepared to be *n familiar terms with suehterrific pressures and white-heat f.rrnaces. Mfr. Hall very judiciously uses Mr. Fowler's plough, which is certainly the best yet produced, and makes very good and well-laid work. Mr. Fowler's implement consists of two sets of ploughs combined in a long frame, which is balanced in the middle upon a pair of wheels, one Eet of ploughs being earried isi the air while the other is in work; and the ploughman, riding upon the framo, steers the whole with accuracy by altering the " lock" of the wheels. The work performed by this implement is very creditable, and it is found that the furrow-slices are shaken and pulverized by the rapidity with which tb's' -^ *__a ---..I . - IrAiug piougied ,nousands of acres by steam power, Mr. Fov,1er has found the superiority of tho operation to horse-ploughing generally acknowledged, and resulting in easier after tillage aud increased yields of cropping. He has now adopted the system of hauling the implement wvith a wire rope by an engine which shifts itself along the headland, and he em. ploys either one engine and an anchorage or else two engines, working one or sometimes two implements to and fro. By this plan a very much less quantity of rope is necessary than when the windlass and engine were fixtures, as in the scheme of last year. The present engines carry the windingdrms beneath them, supported upon a framing. The selfpropulsion of the engines along the headland is very simply and easily accomplished, though it is to be wished that Mr Fowler had adopted Mr. Boydell's rails, particularly in a steep and difficult travelling country like that around Salisbury. Mr. Williams, who also hauls by means of drums and wire ropes, uses both horse and steam power, two ordinary portable engines, with windlasses attached on separate wheels, being stationed at the ends of the field to haul the plough to and fro, while one horse steers the implement by a pair of shafts, and another drags the slack or return rope. Of course, this must be considered a clumsy and expensive ,rrangement, but we like the lightness of the engines and windlasses, and the ready manner in which they propel themselves along the headland. The implement consists of a long triangular timber frame, with a number of ploughs hung on levers beneath; and the draught is applied in a singular manner by rods attached to each plough, instead of to the frame itself. It was found that the ploughs would not keep in the ground without being heavily weightwd; perhaps, if hung lower in front they might operate in a better fashion. Mr. Williams's system of attaching the common portable engine to a windlass is most likely to meet with patronage among agriculturists, but we wish he had been content to use Fowler's plough instead of his own. In the showyard one of the most important departments is that devoted to " machinery in motion," where some 30 steam-engines have been busily driving 24 combined thrashing-machines, several fixed barn works, and almost innumerable mills, chaff-cutters, corn and cake-crushers, &c. The chief firms here exhibiting are Messr. Garrett, Tuxford, Clayton and Shuttleworth, Hornsby, lCansomes and Sims, Barrett and Exall, Turner, Smith and Ashby, Dray and Co., Burrell, &e. Among the novelties are tue small two horse portable engines of Messrs. Smith and Ashby and of Messrs. Turaer, which are likely to be exceedingly useful for driving chaff-cutters, turnip-slicers, and other machinery of the farmstead when itis not worth while to employ the larger engine required for thrashing. lAnd another feature is the application of Boydell's endless rails to ordinary portable enines, so as to render them locomotive by very simple and inexpensive mechanism. Great value will be found in this arrangement, by which the farmer's engine can travel with its thrashing machine from one homestead or estate to anobhor without the assistance of horses. Mr. BurreU and Mr. Lee exhibit engines on this principle, and Mr. Cambridge has one propelled by its carriage wheels with the assistance of a new kind of portable railway. In going through the stands in search of new implements or inventions, we find, in addition to aoward and Ransome's plouglis, Hornsby and Garrett's drills, Crosskill and Busby's carts, &c., that but few absolute novelties are present. Reeves's liquid manure driU for delivering the seed and semi- fluid manure at regular intervals instead of in one continuous flow and an arrangement for watering crops in rows at any distance apart are of considerable importance. On Messrs. Burgess and Key's stand is the celebrated American platform beehive, the new horse-power, and a very cheap and offlcientrotary force-pump on a new principle. Keevil's cheese-making apparatus is calculated to introduce great improvements into this branch of dairying. Messrs. Howard have a revolving turnip thinner on quite a new construction. Smith and Ashby have stiUl further improved their haymaker, and condderable alterations for the better appear. At noon on Tuesday a party of farming notabilities proceeded on a tour of inspection to the water meadows, now in the occupation of the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert. Among the party were the Marquis of Tweeddale, Lord Munaird, Mr. Robson, agent for the Pembroke estateg, Mr. Coombs, the father of modern irrigation, and Mr. Squarry, an authority on the same subject, &G. l'he inspection of the meadows afforded much satisfaction -a satisfaction that was much increased by the peripatetic leoture giveM by Mr. Coombs as we proceeded. Thendi we -went to fir.,Herbert'sZmodel_farm, upon which he undertakes to demonstrate the profitable character of green crops AU is simple, ggod, ad effective, and the orops excellent. The party, consist'nj of some 200 gentiemeil, wsa theLn .. vited to cross the beautiful park, ax'C aenjoy the princely hospitality of Wilton-house in the sILaclous library.

The result ix highly favourabla to Mr. Herbert's system of one-third ecreal and two-third hay, roots, and green crops.

T7TE LATB MR. DOUGLAS JTRROLD. Yesterday evening Mlr. Thackeray delivered a lecture onx "Week-day Preachers," at St. Martin's-hall, for the benefit of the " Jerrold Fund." The nu erous audience who attended on the occasions cheered the lecturer as he ascended the platform with an enthusiasm that showed a strong desire to administer con. solation for the result of the OGford election on Tuesday last. Even if they had been less cordially disposed, they would have been forced into applause by the opening words of the discourse, uttered with a comical solemnity of which MIr. Thackeray alone is capable. " Walking yesterday in the high street of a certain ancient city"-so began the lecturer, and was interrupted by a storm of laughter that deferred for some moments the completion of the sentence. Every one that heard that roar must have felt convinced at once that the orator had secured the sympathies of his hearers on the very threshold. When he resumed the thread of his narrative he ex. plained that in the course of his walk he saw a MS. sermont in a bookseller's shop, which had led him to reflect that the clergyman who might chance to buy this valuable article and make use of it for the pulpit woild probably neglect to inform his admiring congregation that he had purchased it as one of a Ipt, at the rate of .l5s. per dozen.- Inr deed, he greatly doubted whether any crgyiibYi - delivering any one of his discourses to severtd successiV0 J congregations, would inform the last of these bodies oi the number of times that the same benefit had been con. ferred oh similar assemblages. However, his own candour would not allow him to conceal the fact that the greater orini f y ooning's discourse had been already delivered not only in America, but on two occasions in London. On one of these occasions he lhad spoken for the benefit of a Jewish charity, on the other he had contributed. towards the assistance of a literary gentleman whose mis*' fortunes were much commiserated in this metropolis about two years ago. The lecture, in fact, was mainly the same as an oration on " Humour and Charity" that was delivered some time ago at the Marylebone Institution, and comprised most of the sentiments previously e xpressed in the four celebrated lectures on the " British Humorists," with additions connectin g the theme with the writers of modern times. So much being premised, it is scarcely necessary to state that he spoke of Addison with unqualified love and admiration. referred to " Dick Steele," as one would refer to a favourite but somewhat naugbty child; gave a few kindly words to Fielding; scowled somewhat severely at Lawrence Sterne, and alluded to Goldsmith as a general benefactor. The " Week-day preachers " of yesterday evening were; in fact, the " humorists " of his former lectures. With Steele and Addison, he said, began that selection of subjects from ordinary life which distinguished the grave and gay productions of modern literature from the stilted tragedies and heartless comedies of earlier days. Modern writers have felt themselves called upon to address the sympathies of the people, and these are generally on the aide of right and adverse to oppression. Burns and Bcranger were cited as examples of popular song-writers; and to illustrate his theory by a reference to the stage Mr. Thackeray pointed not only to the Black-Eyed Susan of Mr. Douglas Jerrold, but likewise to two plays performed at a penny " gaff," in which wicked aristocrats and virtuous plebeians were the leading personages. Charles Lamb, Thomas Hood, and Punch then came in for his eulogy as so many kindly teachers, and, to give a specimen of our facetious contemporary, he read an article, entitled the " Curate's Walk," known to be a contribution from his own pen. This article is a masterpiece of humour and inobtrusive pathos, and served the lecturer as a starting point in the delicate task of drawing a comparison between him. self and Mr. Dickens, who was present in the hall, and was one of the most enthusiastic of the listeners. He confessed that his view of nature was not so pleasant as theview taken by Mr. Dickens, that he had found critics in his own children, who wished that he could write something like Nicholas lVickleby ; he panegyrized his friendly competitor as a being "commissioned by Divine Benevolence," and spoke of the Christmas Cas-ol as the best of charity sermons. But, as far as concerned himself, he declared that he could only paint life as he saw it, and must stand excused by the honesty of his intentions. Most gracefully was thelecture brougbt to a conclusionby a reference to its immediate object. Within the space of a twelvemonth the weekly dinner shared by the staff of Punc7 has been impaired by two heavy lossee, and Mr. Thackeray expressed the grief he felt through missing Messr. A'Beckett and J rrold at the "kindTy board.' Expatiating on the wit of Mr. Jerrold, he dwelt still more on that intrinsic benevolence of his character which was ignored by those who saw in the brilliant utterer of repartee the severe satirist only. To illustrate this part of his subject Mr. Thackeray read an apologueby Mr Jerrold which shows how a fruit merchant who had dealt in lemons during the greater part of his life found an in superable difficulty in making the world believe that he had abandoned his old trade and taken to the sale of sweet oranges. The editor of Punch, who has held his office from its commencement, came in for his share of eulogy The lecture was loudly applauded at all its "points;" and Mr. Thackeray, after he had quitted the platform, was re. called by the unanimous voice of the audience.
MR. JoNAs WVEBB'S RAms.-The annual letting of the celebrated Babraham rams has just taken place, and attracted a numerous attendance from aU parts of the country. At the public letting 65 rams were hired, and the total amount realized was 1,8121. 12s., or 271. 17s. 7d. head. This was a high average, although rather below that realized last year. In 1852 69 rams were let for 221. 3s. Id. each; in 1853 71 for 221. 6s. 3d. each; and in 1856 77 for 301. ls. 42d. eaeh. The highest price enmmanded on the present occasion by any single ram was 197 guineas, and this is the largest sum Mr. Webb has ever realized for the hire of one of his splendid breed. The hirer was Mr. Lindsey, of New York. The Earl ef Leicester, the Earl of Yarborough, and other noblemen were hirers of other rams, and 70, 50, 71, 100, and 52 guineas were realized in five instances. The business transacted at the public letting does nob convey, however, a complete idea of the extent of Mr. Webb's transactiens, as a great deal of business is concluded with him privately. About 300 gentlemen were present at the usual dinner given by Mr. Webb to his visitors. The chair was occupied by. the Honourable Eliot Yorke, M.., aud the hon. gentleman was supported by Mr. Adeane, M.P. for Cambridgeshire, and Mr. WVyn e, MLF. for Merionethslsire. Among the foreign gentlemen present were Mr. Sach, frora Coblentz, and the Marquis do Vogue, from Fznene.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tlie relations of the officers of the 60th Native Infantry may have seen the letter from an officer in the 9th Lancers, dated May 14, informing them that their friends were on that day prisoners in the hands of their soldiers. I am happy to be able to allay their apprehensions. My brother, Lieutenant R. B. Hill, of the 60th Native Infantry, writes on the 18th of May, and says:- "The men are quiet now, and pleased at the idea of marching." , He aeso says, "The obnoxious cartridges have been taken from them." He mentions a disturbance, but no more. Yonr insertion of this in 2'he Times would much oblige Your obedient servant. WX J. HILL. ly uuu-unuuer.Jage,i u liy Z1.

Miss Smith is residing with her parents and faniily at R6waleyn in strict seclusion, the state of her motheres health giving rise in the family circle to conerable iety.
