It is suspected that there ae othesa in the city. 30Q. of the mutnr tried to escape by getting Into a Se&ftk but they were scen by some of our fellows, andc a psrby*n to dislodge teOm; they fired from ,the rindows, 'ithn our fellows burst open the doors, and, rush. ing in, kiledleveryone. Not one was left alive. We marched down to the lines by the ArtiUery-bri s, the ceatre 6na having been destroyed by the enemy ,e were under heavy fire till we got beyond the canal, but t ax single casualty occurred.

All w-a quiet at Lahore, and up as far as Sealkote, to the 9th ins1 It is snpposed that the check the Delhi Xnufineers Uae received has prevented other corps from showing tho 'tes,; but there can be no doubt that the 'whole native irmy has boen tampered with, and the will 's not wanting to;show their disaffection. Delhi once more in our possession things will probably quiet down again-not before. Hussowlee, June 14. i I enclos ain exitact iasued yesterday from this plac Youl will find inL the letter of the 6th from Ullehpore some facts requ*iug nrafk 'Such brutality ha seldom beeir 'witneued.' The Cabid atrocities were bad enough, but these are 4,orse. In the face of this the Governor-Generai lbs issued a proclamation, offering free pardon to all Sepoys nunoonnected with the past cruelties, as if they wil not join the inaurgents as soon as they are at liberty. (This proClainatirb hba been rescinded,) fFrom the Ddhi Gaz, ERtra of June 13, published at Kussowlee.) Camp, Ullehpore, Jrme 6. Here wear, 10 miles frotn Delhi, wasiing for the siege train and the foreo from Meerut, both of which we expect to-day. Wb should have been at Delhi before now, as we did not intend waiting for the, i, but the Meerut force, instead of ioiaing us at Raeo, where there is a bridge of boats over the Jumna, went to Ghazeeoodeeen luggur, and' did a little fighting on their own account, and they haveo now to join us across a very heavy conntry, getting over the river sa thry best canr A great deal has been said about the delay that has' ourred, but it was unavoidable. Troops eannot march in the hft weather without tents and carriage. Had that beea .done the whole force would have been hors de ceomhs, and now Sir EL Bisanara has brought up rll his men fresh, and, what is more, there is no sickness in camp. The European re`giments from the hills sEuffered from cholera coming down, and while at TUmballah and Kurnaul, but since leAving the latter place sickness has entirely disappeared, atd the whole force is in exeellent health, glorious spirits, and-:ad to be at the mutineers, who will get no mercy. Wo are all so exasperated at what we have heard and discovered within the last week that the men are half inclined to kUl every na tive thoy come across. Give fnU stretch to your imagination-think of everything that is cruel, inhuman, Inf ernal, and you cannot then conceive anything so diabodical as what these demons in hunan form have perpetrated. On the 2d we marched from Paniput to R3ae. At this place eome of the poor fugitives from Delhi met with the most barbarous treatment. We burnt four viUages on the road aud hung seven Lumberdars One of these wretches had part of a lady's dres for his kuTnmerbund-he had seized a lady from Delhi, stripped her, violated, and then murdered her in the most cruel manner, first cutting off her breasts. He said he was sorry he had not an opportanity of doing more than he had done. Another ladywho had hid herself under a bridge was treated in the same matner, then hacked to pieces, avid-her mangled remains thrown out on the plain. We found& psiir ot boots, evidentlythoseofagirl6or7yearsof age,I v het hother They had been cut off just above the ankle. Wehung maii,y other villaiis and burnt the villages as we came along. -A man who witnessed the last massacre in Delhi, where he had gone as a spy, gives a horrid account of it, stating that little childrean wve thrown up in the air and caught on the points of bayoneti'or'ivt at as they weresalling vithtulwars. The siegebal came in this morning, maldng a double march, rith six-companies of the 2d Fasileers. The latter have made eight marches in five days, and are in high health and spirits. To-morrow morning we shall be joined by Brigadier Wrilson's force. The 6oOh dative Infantry have reached Rohtak, and reestablished the magistrate there. All the H3h8i people are in oar camp, including eight or tine ladies. I fear the 2d Oude Cavalry have mutinied and murdered their officers. Snch is the report, but first rumours are always worse than the reality. The mutinecrs have moved out and established themselves 'vith l2guasandabout 3,000 men halfway between this and Delhi. They say they mean to attack us, which is not very likely, though they may possibly play at long bowls with our pickets. If they would only come out in good force we might be saved much trouble at Delhi. Major Y'le has arrived in camp from Cashmere, and taken the command of the 9'h Lancers. Lieutenant Greathed, of the Engineers, has alss oome 1Ato camp from Agra. m.i Meerut. An order was seat just now to the Earopean regiments that weakly and footsore men were to remain behind with the treasure, ia caSe we have to move out to attack. In the 75th and 1st Fosileers not one wealdy man could be found. and hardly any in the 2d Fasileers, af;er their long marches Camp, UIllehpore, June 7. We had no skirmishing yesterday, ind this morning the Meerut troops arrived in admirable health and spiritsstrength asfollows:_ Four guns of Major Tombs's troop of Horse Artillery. Major Scott's orse Field Battery. Tsro 1S-ounders under Lieutenant Light. Two sguadrons ot thee Carabineers. Six companies of the 60th Rifles. 400 of theSirmore battralion (Ghcorkas) Half a ressatoh of the 4th Irregular Horse. The 60th Rifles came in after their 16.mile march, singing in choru, and at a swingtig pace. Colonel HIogge was severely wrounded while in pursuit of the mutinous Sappers and p ners at Mecrut, aand had to be lC't there. To-morrow we march to the cantonments at Delhi. We shall have to. dislodge the mutkineer, from one or twvo posts, en route, but do not anticipate much difficulty. We shall drive in their advanced posts at daylight, and then move on to cantonmdtnn. I believe they havel guns outside, which ought to be ours before breakfast time. Delhi Cantonments, June 8. We marched at 2 a.m from Ullehpore, knowing thet there were 12 gums in a strong position on our read, about three miles of, and when we got near it round shot came flying into us. We got off the road, extended our men, and brought up our artilery to reply to them, which they did, but their guns wero so well served that they did fearful work. I was near-poor Colonel Chester when a round shot took him about his left hip, knocking over him and his horse, also knocking over another officer and two horses-poor Chester's blood came all over my horse, but round shot and grape were pouring into us, and we could not think of others This was behind a hill. At last there was nothing for it but to harge and take the gun, which Her Majesty'd 75th did well, and we rushed- on and attacked them on all sides, Then was erperienced a hail of ausketry ringing past our hoeds. Hlowever, at last the position and 'guns Vere our own, and the enemy in flight, and we then pushed cn to Delhi, and ha to attack and take more guns, and again I had mny escpase; however, it was daylight, and we ,did things betier and here we are. We took- the heights and gus on them, and now are encamped on the old Dclbi parade ground, but though I o'clock no tents up yet. We are occapying any buildings we can And. I am with the General and Staff in sn old hospital, till tents co.me up. The mutineors, in their first position, had the Commander-in-Chief's head-quarter tents; 'which they had got out of the magazine. Ianes of the 60th is with us, and all right -also BecIer, young Briggs, Norman, and the ts-o Greatheds. I do not know yet who are killed and wounded. They are blazing big guns frors the city now, but cannot Wech US. THE TWELI MASSACRES. The following statement, relating to the DIalhi maseacres, and derived from native sources, will be found interesting:- t" Three men were senit two months ago, when the Rajah of Kaporthelle started for Hurdwar to accompany a pro. femsor of muic, n the sarvice of the Rajah, to Delhi. They have been ervants of thea Rajeh from childhood. 'They Ie f Delhi on the $ th of MAy. I have gathered as follows from ene of them who was spokesman. " They aw no troops from DelOi to Raee; the police- Etaon houses on the road were bant, as almo a tahseel or Co11ectio.house. and the villages were being plundered. ! At B.ae there was an advaced guard of the Jhend Rajah!e 3nen. At Russowlee there war a similar party.i They then caino to Panneput, but met with no annoyance Troops, &c., were moving along the road. A number of European Horse Artillery were there ; very few native troops. In the evening four Europeans came to search all travellers in the caravansary. A man who had a quwrrl on the road with them told them to search two Sikhs with a laden oart. On searching it they found 4,000 rupees, a number of weapons, and silver dishes of European gentlemen, evidently plunder from Delhi. The deponents then came to Kurna.uL It was all quiet. The Patteeala Eajah's people were in charge of the road. An Earopean regiment was encamped there. They heard in Kurnaul that the Commander-in-Chief had died there. In the oaravansary there were some 50 Europeans, male and female, and about 40 children, who had escaped from Delhi. They then came to Peeplee. There they met the siege train from Phillour. A gun was in difriculty, and people were employed in extricating it. They met some of the European Lancers about 16 miles on thiz side, They then reached Shahabad. On arriving at Umballah arrangements were going on for disarming a corps, and at Dourahah Seria they met the Guides Corps. At Lushkuree Khan Ke Serie they met a dttaehment of Seikh and Punjabee horsemen. "Now they proceed to state what they saw and heard themselves, for they were In Delhl a month before the outbreak took pL First only five troopers camae into Delhi from Meerat. They first went to the house of (name not clear, so I omit it) an agent of the King of Delhi, near the Delhi-gate inside the town. He came out and said he was in the-service of the King. They would not listen to him, but cut him down, and then murdered his wife and family, and told the people to plunder the house. They then went to the housss in Darya Gunj. Peer Bukab, one of the I deponents, maw the troopers go to a pink-coloured house; the owner was an Europe an; they killed him,and plundered and burnt the house. They plundered and burnt all the houses in this suburb, wbich is chiefly inhabited by clerks, and murdered all who could not escape. I "By this time other iroopers and infantry and townspeople joined in the work of destruction, A number of the fogitives tookrefuge ina building near the mosque of AurangZebe's Qdaughter, and began to defend it against the insurgents. These were held at bay. They left people all round, and the main body went off to the Bank, There they were joined by more mutineers. They plundered and murdered wherever they found Europeans. The townspeople assisted warmly in the plunder, and the mutineers of the infantry were particularly active. The commissioner, Mr. Fraser, on hearing of the advent of the mutineers, had gone down to cut away the bridge, but was too late. On returning he met the mutineers at this place. The mutineers said to the commissioner's escort, 'Are you on the side of the Europeansor on that of religion.' They said the latter. The commissioner, on hearing this, drove offin his buggy. His escort remained passive. The mutineers followed and cat down the gentleman. He fired one pistol. The mutinees hilled people on the road, but being more intent on the magazine, they went to it. After arranging matters for surrounding the place the insurgents and mutineers proceeded to the gaol, One of the sentries shot a man, but 'when they said they were fighting for religion the guard joined them and 500 convicts were released. They then closed all the gates and went into theFort. They paid theirI respects to the King; he made objections, and said he had no army; he at last consented. " On the second day they went to the magazine, 'where many Europeans had taken refuge. After some firing on lboth sides, the natives, such as Lascars, would do nothing, they hid themselves; the Europeans alone carried on the defence; but, seeing they could do nothing against so many, they hlew up the wall towards the river; some 200 of the rebeis or more were destroyed by this. They however got in and destroyed as many Europeans as they could, and plundered weapons, kc., leaving only the guns and kowder.| Two native infantry regiments were presenLt. They searched, and everywhere they could find Europeans they slew them. On the third day. they went back to the house near the raosque where some Europeans had taken refuge. As they were without water, &o. for several days they called for a B. badar (deponent was present) and five others,and asked them to take their oaths that they would give them water and take them alive to the King; he might kill them if heliked. On this oath the Europeans came out, the mutineers placed water before them and said 'Laydownyour arms sad thenyou get water.' They gave over two guns, all they had. The binhuneers gave no water. They seized 11 children, among themiafants, eight ladies, and eight gentlemen. They took them to the cattle sheds. One lady, who seemed more sldfpossessed ihaz ihe rest, observed thit they were not taldng them it OPihi rplid~t1sey *ere I1taofiT eheim vi, Durya Gtmj. t)eponent says that he saw all this, and saw them placed inr, -row and, shot. One woman entreated them to give her child water, though they mighb kill her. A Sepoy took her child and dasbed It on the ground; the people looked on in dismay, and feared for Delhi. "- The King's people took some 35 Europeans to the Palace; on the fifth day they tied them to a tree, and shot them. They barnt their bodies. " Oa the fifth day notice was given that if any one concealed a European he would be destroyed. People disguised many, and sent them off, but many were killed that day, mostly by people of the city. "fMatters remained pretty quiet for two days. The DMa Gonj Bazaar was turned into an encampment for the mutineers. Shops were plundered in the Chandnee Chonk and Dlereeba Bazaar. The shops were shut for five days. The King went through the city, and told the people to open the shops. At each gate there is a company of native infantry. About 9,000 mutineers are assembled. No cavalry have joined, excepting from Meerut. Some 4,000 or 5,000 new men have been raised, but they are rabble. During the festival of Eed. while at prayers, there was the dust of a kafila of laden animals. An alarm arose-it was the English army ; the people all rushed helter-skelter into the city. " The King refused to go on the throne. The mutineers assured him that a similar massacre had taken place up to Peshawur and dowin to Calcutta. He agreed, and comn. menced to give orders. He appointed the following fflicers-llukeem, Nussuroola, Mahhoob, AlUe, and one other belonging to the mnutineers, but deponent knows not bis name. His new levies receive 4 annas a-day. Guns ae placed on ihe ramparts of the town. These are pronounced strong. The Sappers and Miners are mounting guns in Selimghur. The mutineers say when the army approaches .hey will fight, and that the native troops with the army are sure to join them. Many mutineers who tried to get away with plunder were robbed; thishas prevented many othere from leaving. "A tailor concealed no less than five Europeans; the deponent thinks many more are concealed, " The mau has been w.ith me, he speaks frankly and without fear. He is able to narrate evidently many a harrowing tale, but I did not wish to hear any. He seemed really to recall with dismay what he had witneesed. "A.

There are many others, names unknown, who are said to have been killed by the rebels some days subsequent to the llth; but It is imposible to find out'the truth of this at present. It is certain, however, that severall4gentIEr were kiled in the Dawk Bungalow, andaamily nan1 Allwell have not been seen or heard of tine.: The following are extracts frora the diary of iaU of icer in Calcutta:- "We all thought that the last steameri would have Iken the news of the fa of Delhi, butstill it is iu the hands of the rebels, ad st1i is the fate of India In the balance. Every day we hear of more regiments having thrQwn off, their allegiance and having taken the road to join the headquarters of the mutineers. Terrible times are these. The Bengal armyrolongerexists. Notrustcan be placed in aDy regfment. One day a corps professea the-most devout attachment to the Government-the next day we hear i - has murdered all its officers,men,women, and children. Not a day has passed but we have anticipatea the fall of Delhi, and the delay to us is unaccountable. Our communi. cations sinoo the outbreak have been very-irregniar,' butnow they are entirely out ofl, both postal and telegraph. The post, when one does come in, is lonagverdue. Thank Heaven ! we have two good men iu comnand, Sir John aud Sir Henry Iawrenbe. They are the sasioura of India. Theformer has kept the Panjab quiet-the latter has stood hii ground manfully at Lucknow. We have also another good man in Sir Hugh Wheeler at Cawnpore, and the GovornbrGeneral deserves all praise for his conduct in doing 411 isa hi3 power to get reinforeements together and to push -them on up country with the greatest expedition possible. 1- donet know what you will think of all this at home. It mit affect nearly every family in England, for there are few who have not relations and friends out here. Men who were here during the time of the Cabul disasters tell me that the panic then was nothing to what at present pravails. Trade is at a standstill. The natives, too, particlpate-in the alarm, -those *ho have to loee and those on the qui )ivae for gain, and there is no want of the latter. " Gbodness knows what ha1 come over the Sepoys,. hitherto so obedient, so patienl, mand o-00il- I- -It-A no longer the cartridge qnestion, but a religlous War -a call upon all good and true Mahommedans to rse in tse name of the Prophet and sdaughter the Feringhee infidels. It is more a revolt of thQ former sect than of the XIindoos. What hundreds of thoisandS in the course of time, muns; have fallen viotims in the name of reigion! I suppose all' the unfortunate woomen were murdered in the name of religion. Poor unfortunates!-God help them ! It is a mercy they are all kiled. But I do not suppose all the atrocities were perpetrated by the Sepoys; I imagine they were committed by the scam of the earth, that never comes forth but on such occasions of murder and rapine,-whose existence most people are ignorant of. The Sepoy; I suspect, were giving their attention to the plunder that was to bo picked up,-bat that is no excuse for them. Around about Meerut and Delhi there are twro or three pcduliar castes or tribe; something silar to our gipsies, only hold. ing human lie at lees value, and which in former days gave constaet trouble, but who of late yors have lived in peaoe and quietness, and have contented themselves with picldng np stray cattle and things that did not belong to them, but who have now on the first opportunity broken out and hwve been guilty of all kinds of depredations. Skinner's Horsa was originally raised to keep these people jt order about the time of Lord Lake. These men have hitherto been necessary at Meerut, Delhi, and those parts as watohmen. Every one was obligod to keep one; if you did not you would be robbed to a certainty. You will not undersUtad this, but it is necessary to come to Inaia to undertand many things-many that are beyond any explanation that I can give at least. " 12th.-Yesterday no news, but plenty of repors. Never was the country in such a state of disorder. The Oompany's paper is down very low; the new 5 per cent. loan few subscribe to, and the Four per Cents. were yesterday at 20 discount, and I see by the itewspaperthat at Beusates it was at 42 discount. Wo must have a new loan, audyou must give us the money, I suspect. Out of the treasuries alone that have been robbed I should think nearly two railllions of money have been taken; and then fancy the expense of the transport of all these Europeabs. " You must be just about receiving the first newe of the outbreak, and I hope you have sent o,f reinforce.. mients from Malta overland, I think steamers ought to Be.Seni.$o: SUeZ in anticigation of your doing Mo. Bombay and 3d*ami are not safe now they are denuded of the English trbopt.apd I expect to hear of outbreaks every day. Itebellionis catching, evidently. If you will read the papers you will see that Sir Henry Iawrence is. hanging the fellows at Lucknow as fast as he can. The 37th Native Infantry that has just mutiniedat Benares 1know very wl, bavint been at Jhelumn with thena. It wv at uvp good regimerlt, partieularly in Affghanistan, wVhbre on seyer* ooa%ETons it Ied the wa i y for example. The Subadar-MAjir, the eor t, officer of the regiment, was :woimndea 8eYel tIes, it not odd that now he should forget his duty, and tur traitor, after such good and honourable service? Isupwose it is alireligion, or do you suppose it can be possible that Russia has had anything to say to it ? I have no doubt that she stirred up Persia against us, but Persia Was too late in bxeaking out, or the war in the Crimea ceased too abruptly. Persia might now break the treaty and advance upon Candahar. Dost Ma'aommed wouldiolnt,andwhatcouldwe do ? The whole country would rise just for the change of the thing, and we should be beaten in detail everywhere. We have not a native regiment to depend on-not one that would stand firm if the day was going against us. "I cannot help againmakingmentionof the wayour countrymen are dressed. My room is rather a cool ose. It is avery airy one, and I keep the hot air shut out after thesun has risen, or rather, I close the doors directly it begins to get warm, but the thermometer will stand at 0 and92. Isee the men of ihe 64th and 84th, and, in fact, all regiments just arrved, are clothed in the tunio, the same as they wear at home. Fancy what the heat must be, fancy the discom. fort ; and then the cloak and 60 rounds of ammunition! I cannot help feeling for them. The men suffered fright fully out in the Crimea from the weight put on their backs, but what mlust it be in a much hotter, and more trying climate in every way I It is such absurd folly, dressing a man here as he would ba at home, whean the very sight of a cloth coat gives an unpleasant sensation. I would let them wear the tunic in the oold weather, but to put a man in one in June in India is oruel, aud not only cruel, but bad policy, for tho men must suffer from it, and the firs duty of a Generalis to bring his men fresh into the battlefield; and how c,n amarn be fresh after a maroh of even 10 miles with such oppressive clothing and such a thing as that shako is to wear ofa hot day ? I would give a mAn a white smockfrock to wear in cantonments, where he migLt get it washed, bat in tho field he should have a coloured one, so as not to require a clean one daily. In the small river steamers the men are being sent up country in (packed like sardines) they still stick to the tunic. I stppose it is in orders from the Horse Guards. I told you in my last of two men being struck down from the sun, procoeding up in the bullock erts, Since then I have heard that others have suffered frightfully, and at a time when the life of every man is of so much consequence; andwhen is it not s The people at home howl about a murderer being strang up. They can look on and see their soldiers sacrificed with complacency. " 17th, Tuesday.-I went to bed late on Saturday night, and was woke up at 2 on Snnday morning with orders to assemble. On going to parade I found it was feared the troops at Barrackpore were going to break out, and march alths r on this or Duindurm. We set out immediately on the Barrackpore road, accompanied by 50 men of the 37th Foot, which had arrived the day before from Ceylon. We marched up the zoad nins miles, and there halted for the day. On Sunday after. noon the troops at Bsrrackpore were disarmed, as also all here. They delivered up their arnms quietly. At I2 on Sunday night an express reached us from the Governor. General, directing a party to be sent bask to Calcutta instanter. I mounted immediately, and cantered in within the hour and went to the fort, where I found a force assembling to march to Garden Reach for the pupose of taking the King of Oude prisoner. It was to be a sur prise on our part, and so it proved. We got there at 4 o'clock, surrounded his grounds directly, and had the good fortune to find all at home. We were rather afraid he would get news as to what was going ou, but we went down quietly and the surprise was complete. I was ahead of the party with my men. His Prime Minister and the whole batch, papers and all, were seized. " AlILSnday there was a tremendous panic in Calcutta. Many people went on board the ships, and others had their carriages at their doors to be ready t start at a momen's warning. We have volunteer guards now, cavalry and infantry. They go the rounds at night and loolc brave. The 37th, in the short march of nine mile6, the other night, suffered very much, and they had only been but aix days on board ship from Ceylon. It was the deathof one captain. The men had -the small forage cap, AIt only for the barrack-square in England-no protection whatever from the sun. They had white jackets on, I was glad to see; bat even then the heat was so great that the erossbelt was wet through from perspiration. Stocks, of course.

.; TEA DIAT? RBBELLIO2G. TO THE EDITOR OF VABE TIME r-I appealed to you as' the leadei of public opinion, and-in aletter by the lt mail entireted that theheart of ugland might be roused to a just sense of -duty at the prefent cisis. Since then the clouds have darkenA all- awound, and the task to which our countryis nowcalled is the reconquest of India.h re.qu I greatly fear that favourable news from Delhi will satisfy the public mind that we have the power here to put 4down the 'rebellion. But there could not be a more grievous or terrible mistake. We have an enormous extent of country to reoccupy. Having cleare& it of all insurgents and marauders, it Will remain to secuie and protect every single station by European troops. In all the large stations we must have a moveable column, and the work of crushing and trampling out every spark of rbe1Iionw in e'very corner of the empire must be camred on 'with unremitting energy and overwhelming force. n a few weeks the country will be covered with .water, and military movements will be rendered almost impossible; but our " brave Sepoys," who are-such adepts at plunder and murder, and all the released prisoners from our gaols, and al the ma-ra&Vding Pindarees, Mahrattees, and Oude men, will be -prosecuting their trade with unabated vigour, spreading wider and wider, and filling up their cup of iniquity. Mepawhile the land will be untilled and um10wn, the -cbld weather will approach with a famine impending, and to meet the exigency the most comprehensive and complete arrangements muBt be made: before the first movement of the campaign. It will hot do to send us 20 regiments; it willl not do to send us raw recruita. Eng1iad miush bestir herself-az when her ar;ny- an4, her reputati-6n were in peril dtui the Russian wvar. Her militia must return to Gi taltar, to MIalta, and to Corfu; and the regimebts there nust be sent on to us. Her home defence must be trusted to her militia even more than in 1855; and by one grand consuimrate efort 50,000 nore troops must be sent to re-establish BrBdtsh upremacy in India. They must come soon, and all "the people hMre must see our silent, gradual concenttation of overwhelming forces and resources and the pliln uninistalkeable proof that we are thoroughly and sternly in earnest. And let me sdy that our policy should be animated by one single idea-the. complete subjugation of the native mind. An Oriental does not understand your sympathy with his prejudices or your tenderness for his caste, or for anything else which is emphatically hi3 and not yours. He will respect you only when he feels that you have a will of your own and have the power to enforce it. And, therefore, this ii not the time for forbearance, for; palaver about toleration, for prof4stations of religious -neutrality, or for anythingg of the kind. We have something else to talk about just now. We have been deceived and betfayed, our authority nearly overthrown, our countlrymen murdered by hundreds in a savage and dastardly manner, and the peacefulportion of the -people plundered, mutilated, and tortured, and the whole land laid waste. The caste which is the excuse for this,or the Islamism which is the cause of it, we will talk about by and by. Meanwhile there is oli6 thing to be made known and understoodthat England's dominion is to be restored sumniarily, deci*ively, and triuxaphantly. These treacherous rebels-have sought to measure strength with us- I let them abide the issue. Europe and America look on, and it remains to be seen if the ancient vigour which, gained this empire will now revive to regain it. Ldoubt not that it will. But it is a trying time-a time for firnt-rate men, a time for heroic measures. The result, with God's good help to our just and righteous cause, I am contident will be an entire victory, and a new and glorious era for India pnder a more powerful Government, and under moreronstant British vigilUnce, than she has ever known before. She must be incorpbmate4 into our liticalasjsFem, not treated as a distant adjunct. hemusbe governed by a responsible Miiiibter, the British Legislature, and p'ublic opinion; not by delegated authority auy longer. Axid, above all, the poliXicl spirit alike of Mahomedanimn and fllndooism mnst now be finaly extinguished rouah~iut the empire. TH EDrOR OF TE TiMET. Sir,-The North-Western, Pxovince z my be said to htve gone, including the whole of Oude, and away across Rapootanahtothe Bombay Presaidency. At t ipoment we literally know nothing of Agra, awnpoie, Lucknow, or even Allababad. At the latter place some Europeans and Sikhs are in the fort, but they were running short of sup plies w;hen the last accounts left, and the Sikhs ar oubtfuL. IIn Central India Jhausi and Nowgong are already gone, and fears are entertained of Saugor. Our alies from (Gwalior and Bhurtpore have been so far faithful that the leaders have not turned agairist ue, but many of the men have. The temptation of' plunder is almost irresistible to the MIahratta. We look southward to Hyderabad in the Deccan with intense anxiety. It contains 60,000 fighting men (Arabs and others), and our adjacent force is one European regiment and five Madras native corps. If our Gvalior and Bhurtpore Rajahs turn, or if .Ryderabad rise, or if the matiny spread to Madras,jv,where are wve? The movement assumes a more Mahomedan character. This renders the complicitv of Hyderabad more likely. We have arrested the King of Oude and his Prime Minister and lodged them in Fort William. I hope there is evidence against them, but I fear there is little besides the confession of a spy who went into the fort and tampered with the Sepoys. We have had a silly panic here. It was reported by General Hearsey that the Sepoys were about to rlee at Barrackpore. The 78th Highlanders were sent there, and the 37th (from Ceylon) were placed on the road between Calcutta and Barrackpore; and thereupon half Calcutta went mad about an invasion of Bariackpore Sep6ys, Nc., and many took refuge on board ship. It was most unfortunate, for now the news in an exaggerated form will fly through Bengal, where already there were sufficient causes for uneasineom. We fear that it will be impoesibf#'to hold Berhampore (Moorshedabad), a city of tbout 100,000 people 120 miles fromrCalcutta, 'without more European troops than we can I spare. The Sepoys at Barrackpore and Calcutta were disaimed on the 14th, and now are deserting in numbers to turn plunderers and worse. As to that 34th 'hich was disbanded in April, our leniency to their infamous treason is now doubtless rewarded byte leading the way in all the atrocities up the W t hey have been I shudder to tell. We must make allowance for the channels through which reports reaph uie, but I fear that there remains a most awful residue of truth in the horrible stories of murder, rape, tortures, massacres of children, burning of wounded and mutilated people, and, so on. The case of the 6th Regiment at Allahabad has surpassed all. Up to the last they were foremost in extraordinary profesions of loyalty, and they went so fAr as to seize two emissaries and get them hinged. Suddenly they rose, killed the officers at mems, burnt the city, or a large part of it, seized the treasure (either 170,0001. or 190,0001., 1 am not quite sure which), and began massacriig the help- less Europeans right and left. A Erenchman the are said to have burnt alive. 'These are onr boasted. Sepoys-petted, iadulged in whims and fanies, with aLl their erothes recog- nized. In nO regiment have any faithful men given any single offlcer timely warning, or warning- at all, extcept, I believe, some of the 11th in the first outbreak atMSeerut. In my last letter I said a few words of the Irre- gulars. We have since suffered both from thema and the Sikhs, but there has been no further trouble with the Ghoorkas. At Kussowlee they seized the treasury, but only helped themselves to the exact sum due for pay I Still they couldnot be trusted, and were not taken on with the force against Delhi. That: force consisted only of 2,800 Europeans. You m,ay imaagine our anxiety for tidings. Should there be a check or a reverse no one can conceive tbe onaequbnicea. Werequire here all that England can do. She had 5e0~0v men before Sebastopol with 100,000 rencmen when the war wasterminated. f India is to be reconquared less than 56,000 additional troops to out, present force will not sufflce, and weshall require men to lead them lilke Jacob, LawrenceA . Edwardes, Cham'oerlain (our best Indians) -and all 'the be~it men of the Qi4een's aervice. -I- au happy to hear that e.vidence is being oitained both aa to the Emperor of Delhi and the Xing of Oade. It will bepleasat to save 250,0004 or 300,0001a. ytar in thefr forfeited pensions. I hive some lkop9 that the nawab of MoorshEfdabad may be implicated too. That would 'aye 120,000. A-yearmore. Onee again do allow me to plead earnest that, instead of now yielding to cute, and pottering about the "prejudices" of the natives, our future policy should be ah unbeiding, stern, and avowed discouragement of everything oppoaed to civiliza tion, social moral, and British supremacy. If we now issue a proclamation deelaring that, whereas caste has been used as a plea for sedition, and whereas it is based on falsehood, and the British Government regards all men as born equal, therefore henceforth it shall not be recogdized in any form, the whole Hlindoo population will bow, admit the justice of our indignation, and this monstroun anti-social absurdity will soon perish. I am not for letting the State turn missionary. But if our soldiers knock down every filthy idol they see, and lay every muBjid level with the ground, and if they pollute every shrine and plunder every one which is worth plundering, I shall not be sorry. For as to these " religions"what are they, in fact, but lust, hoe, treachery, murder, and socia degradation ? I should 1iIe to see our Government cause it to be known that its past forbearance has been abused, and that noDw MIahomedans and Hindoos muAt look to it for no sort of countenance. Yours sincerelv- AN ANGIO.INDIAW. u.auCutee, June 18.
SETTLEMENT 0 THE SUFPBIANUATIOH Q7PsrTIoN, TO. TEXDIT -) H IIM3 Sir,-The final deisloneome to by the House of Oom. nons last night will be accepted with gratitude by the mem4 bers of the civil servce, and will furnish them with a new mnotive to zalous exertion. Everything depends upon the tone and spirit of a body of public srvants. Rules and xystems are a poor security compared with that habitual sense of duty which inddces a publio servant to do the best he can for his employers under all circumstances, as a faithful steward of his time and opportunities; or, as St. Paul sums it up, "As unto the Lord, and not unto men." But this cannot be attained unless the reciprocal rtlation implied In.the old English proverb-" good masters make good servants"-ia fuilled. The Government also wsI now be armed with a moral power of exaoting full work, of adjustlng the rate of salary to the nature of the duties to be performed, and of limiting the persons employed to the number absolutely neoessary, which it has never yet possessed. There is, however, another point of view, which is the immediate occasion of my addressing you. In this crisis of our national affairs it is moro than uually important, not only that we should act rightly, hut also that the motives of our actions should be gener ally appreciated and acquiesced in. In other words, that we should be a united people. I hall therefore submit some remarks on the policy and justice of this measure, in the hope that I may succeed in convincivg some of those who voted in the minority that we had some reason on our side. And first, as to the policy. The payment of public servants by salaries subject to deduction for pension is a thoroughly bad mode of paying them. The objeot is to ascertain the proper amount of remuneration and the proper mode of adjusting it, and most of those who have studied the subject will agree that theFe conditions are best fulfilled by a moderate rate of salary during active service, followed by a moderate pension on retirement. If this be so, what justification is there for deductions t They are not wanted, and they can do nothing but mischief. If they are a real diminution from the proper amount of alary they are an injustice to the public servant and an nujury to the public service, owing to the discontent they "reate. Oa the other hand, if the salaries are increased in proportien to the dedtuctions, then the deductions are a sham, and a mischievous sham, because-they keep up a perpetual blister of discontent and craving after increased remuneraIon. Whatever may be the amount of a persou's salary, be always believes that he fairly earns It aud is entitled to t; and if a portion of it is withheld in the shape of deductions he consders himself wronged, aud stves to obltin redress in aome way or other, F _,t;he pblic at,r6 is gratly oonoerned In tbe * r mblo frvants. The inatrseuit with which we have to ct is men, with o'ur oomnmon human nature; and unless WCe have their affections and feelings on our side we shall only get faint, poor service. Experience also shows that bodies of men, and especially of Englishmen, are generally content when they are fairly treated. When the deductions were imposed there was a reason for them. The country was strongly impressed with the abuses of the old pension system, and but for this arrangement it might have been difficult to maintain the new superaunuation system. But now another state of things has arisen. The old abuses are nearly extinctk and correct prin. ciples of administration are sufficiently understood to make it apparent that pensions on retiremeat axre a necessary part of official remuneration. It has also become obvious that human nature, and especially English nature, will not bear to see persons who have devoted their lives to the public service suffering painful and disgraceful poverty in their old sge, and there is therefore no danger of Parliament withholding retired allowances, even if no deductions are requred from salaries. Next, as to the justice of the case, which depends entirely upon the solution of this question-whether the existing rates of salary were fixed as the just remuneration of the several classes of clerks and other offioers, without any reference to the abatements, or were fixed with an ex. press reference to them, so that if the abatements were given up the several classes of public servants would receive more than they are entitled to by the amount of the abatements. ALl who were employed in revising the public establishments, whether they were Parliamentary or permanent officers, agree in saying that the scale of salaries recommended by them were settled at what they believed, after full investigation, to be the fair rates of remuneration, without any reference whatover to the abatements. To have acted otherwise would have been a breach of trust on the part of these commissioners, because the Act of PaTliament directed that certain abatements should be made from the salaries, and to have increased the salaries, in proportion to the abatements would therefore have been an evasion of the Act. The commissioners revised the salaries of some establishments which were subject to abatements and of some which were not, end they revised the salaries of other establishments, some bra,ches of which were subject to abatement and some branches of which were not, and they fixed similar rates of salary for all. Mlorcover, it constantly happened that in the same branch of the same establishment were included some persons who had entered before Augnst, 1829, and therefore did not pay abatements, and others who had entered after August, 1829, and therefore did pay abatements,* and both these olases of persons were dealt wi,h according to the same rule. This last consideration furnishes mathematical demonstration that the salaries were not fixed with any reference to the abatements ; for, if they had been, there must have been two rates of salary iR the same office-one for thof'e who paid, and anofher for those who did not pay abatements. Whoever may have recommended or authorized these cales of salaries, they would have departed from the intention of the Superannuation Act if, in consideration of abatements being paid, they had authorized higher rates of salary than they would otherwise have. done; and lt was physically impossible for them to have fixed these salaries with an express reference to the payment or non-payment of abatements, unless they had arranged for therebheSg two rates of salary in each offioe-one for those who entered before aud the other for those who entered after August. 1829, which was not done in a single case. As not only the maintenance of the present higb position of this country, but its actual safety, now depends upon good administration under the several heads of Army, Navy, and Civil Service, and as the foundation of all good administration consists in the proper selection, the proper promotion, and the proper retirement of the public servants; two important steps towards the desired result have been made in the passirg of the Order in Council of the 21st of May, 185, for the purpose of "' testing according to fixed rules the qualifications of the young men vho may from time to time be proposed to be appointed to the junior situations in any of Her Majesty's civil establishments," and in the just and politic settlement of the superannuatlon question which was made yesterday by the House of Com. mons.

MONBY-ACABKBTatWCXI'YI,VTBLLXGBX,O.a. saturday Evening. The doubt and excitement to-day regarding t4 captuze of Delhitas been Almost equal to that which attended the frst fale report of the fall of Sebas. topoL All the operations iu the funds have tuned upon the degree of cmedit attached to the rumour, ind l'thOugh nothing approaching to a positive "nfrmatioyn ot 'i could be traced in any quarter, there was a wide impresion it wiU prove true. The chief facts cited in favour of it are, that up to the latest date of the commercial advices from Bombay, the native merchants were confident upon the point, and were freely acting upon it, while from Agra private letters have been received fiom an officer of, rank, dated the 17th of June, stating that our forcew had occupied the city, but had yet to take the fort; and also mentioning that the troops in posession were those from Meerut and lUmballah, that great havoc had been executed upon the insurgents, and that the losa on the British side had been inconsiderable. As the native merchants at Bombay are extremely keen in getting early possession of news, frequently contriving, like the Greeks in London, to auticipate theGovernment by several days, and as the Agra letter gives details, and that station is only 1OO miles from Delhi, there would apparently be reason to hope that the whole might be considered probable, or, at all events, possible. But the Bomba-y Times of the 1st of July furnihes a statement -which seems to dispel it entirely. Referring to the last advices from Delhi, they say, " General Barnard was waiting reiaorceeats on the morning of the 17th, after having repelled several sorties," This is the same date as that of the letter from Agra, and the latter, t'hereiore, is shown to have been written under the influence of one of those rumours of the capture of the city which had evidentiy been in circulstion throughout the country during the whole of the preceding week. The only surmise that can be raised after this to favour the slightest conjecture of the tale not being a delusion is that there maay have been a mistake in stating that the news from Delhi reached Bo late as the 17th. T.he fact that the last despatch published from General Barnard is only of June the 8th, and tbat his dlosing paragraph promises "fuller details to-morrow" as the siege train was up and he hoped to open on the town without a moment's delay, gives some countenance to this view ; but at the same time there are a variety of incidents which mke strongly against it, such as the ofEicial notification ised at Lahore on the 19th of June, to the effect ',hat up to 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th all was quiet before Delhi, vwhile it also appears that reinforcements were to be waited for which did not leave Umballah till the 17th. When in addition to these ciunumstances it is mentioned that the despatches received at the India-house are understood to contain nothing to warrant faith in the report, and that the Madras advices, from which it first gained circulation here, appear to contain only a repetition of what had been heard at Bombay, Itis tobe feared that the confidence manifested t)day must be regarded as premature. Consols for mnoney, which left off last evening at 90j, were first quoted 9Oi to 8, the painful accounts of the universal cruelty and treachery of the Indian troops having caused a general feeling of gloom. The belief in the takizg of Delhiithen again became strong, and a variety of fancied proofs of its correctnes having been quoted, an advance of a-half per cent. took place, which was maintained to the close, the last transactions being at 90 to 91 for money, and 910 to i for the 9th of September. During a short period there had been buyers for money at 91. Bank Stock left of at 215 to 217; Reduced, 91* to i ; New 3 per Cents, 91 , India Stock, 214 to 216 ; Yud". Xi eu. a.e. caucounv, ama ulacxluezr. Bills, 6s. to 2s. discount. The operations during the day were not extensive, and the rate for advances on the Goverment securities was 51 per cent. The market for foreign atocks has shown considerable firmness, and in some transactions a smal ad. Yance took plw, In Turkish there was a furtheinaproverent of nearly 1J per cent. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were rather flatter. Rissian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 98 and 98F-; Buenos Ayres, 84; Granada Deferred, 6(; Mexican, for the account, 22g; Sardinlan, 89j; Spanish Certificates, 5-g I; Turkish Six p3r Cents., for the account,,94A 9Xg; ditto Four per Cents., Guaranteed, 100 I00; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 95c. for money and 66f. 8Sc. for the present account, showing in the former case an advance of a quarter per cent. The India Company have given notice to-day of a further rise of 2 per cent, in their rate for bils on India. On Bengal and Madras it wiU now be 2s. id., and on Bombay 2s. 1id. This will completely check the purchase of bills, and proportionably augment the demand for silver. The drain of bullion from the Bank is therefore likely to go on. The large sum of 64,0001. was withdrawn to-day, making a total absorption of about 410,0001. within little more than a-week. The Lightning, from Melbourne, has been announced with 33,866 ouncea of gold, valued at 135,4841. ; bult, as the ehipmentis by the India and China mail of the 4th are now likely to be increased to 1,000,0001., and preparations are already in progress for-sending fully as much by the succeeding packet, there is little probability that this arrival will stop the outflow from the Bank for more than a day or two. From the step just adopted to check their drawIngs on India it is evident that the India Company feel that in the present crisis they must not trench further on the rcaources of the local Government. The heavy payments in the shape of two-thirds of the fr-ight money that will have to be made at CaL cutta on the arrival of the steam transports now in course of despatch w'illbe a sfficiently large liabilit~j There is ronn, suoreotr, to beli :va theb LLe hmen authorities are supplied with funds for all immedla I ;wants. The announcement to-day, however, of the alteration in their rates will doubtless lead to a revival of the recent reports that the Government will be compelled to raise a loan for them. Indeed, in various quarters the amount is stated. Some fix it at 6,000,0001, and others at 10,000,0001. But the true policy is to make India provide for her own wts, and happily the accounts even by the present mail do not indicate that there would be any difficulty in that respect. The public treasuries have doubtless suffered heavily, and the estimated loss of 700,0001. mentioned by The Tines oi1 the arval of the pre-nous mail is more likely to prove accurate than the smaller sum stated in other quarters. Still, the last 5 per cent. loan was at only 1I per cent. discount, and it was consequently probable that any moderate amount could be raised at a slight advance Upon that rate. The fact of even the o per cent, loan being at a diseount is explained in the 13ombay letters as having been caused by an expec tution t'at a new and large loanwill be required and that 6 per cent. will probably be offered. It is remarkable that almost aLl the meran.tile letters from India received by this mail express perfect confidence in the ultimate eourse of events. In fact, their tone seems much less anxious than that of the communications from the military or civil officers, whose cognizance of the real nature of such a cisis is of course more acute. They state, however, that business Is completely at a staad, the transit of produce being rendered difficult by the pluuder carried on in all the disturbed districts, -whle with regard to European goods the importe, even if they coald find buyers, would be indisposed to extend their credits to the native dealers until order had been to a certain degree restoreda The advance of .2 per cent. just made in the r;te of the Bank of Bengal was consequent upon large sums having been obtained from it by speculators for the purpose of buying up Company'i paper, wbich at Luckrnow and some other places was selling at 40 pet cat. discout. The Btock of specie held by the bank was atill 1,500,0001, Owing to the check likely to be given to the production of aU the most important articles of export, oouplec ith the difficulty in getting thdm from the interior, an, opinion appears to bave prevailed, both st Bombay and Calcutta, that the existing adverse rates of exchange for England would not long be maintained. The following is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meeting of the Dutch 1henish, at Amsterdam, a dividend was declared, being the amount provisionally distributed in January last. A representative of the English shareholders commented in strong terms upon the fiscal Arangements of the Prussian and DTitch Governments, and complained that the former had not given its co-operation in obtaining the goods traffic under the treaty of 1851, for which the company had expended 1,000,000 forms. A committee of shareholdersasappointedtoadvsp ewiththedi-ectors on the subject of increasing the traffic and reducing the working exenses. Atanieeting of the Oxford, Worceater, and Wolverhampton a frill dividend was declared onthefirst guaranteed stock andiper cent. on the second. The chairman expressed a hope that when the traffic increases to 5,0001. per week, and the expenses are reduced to 40 per cent., they may pay all their fied charges and, after extinguishing the arrear of preference dividends, have a surplus for the original shareholders. A resolution was passed authorizing the taking up of stock to the amlount of 25,000l.in theWorcesterandHerefotdline forthepurpose of completingit ; thelNewer, Abergavenny, and Wereford incureng the ame obligation; an agree- ment with the SeVern Valley was also approved. I The dividend of the London and South-Weatern for the pat half year Is at the rate of 41 per cent The Leominster and Ringston has been only formally opened, a:nd not for public traffic, the Government-Inspector having made an objection to a crossing on the level instead of by a bridge. The opening of a new route to Manchester consequent on the working alliance conocluded between the Great Northern and the Mancester, Sheffield, and Lillcolnshire has had the effect of increasing travelling facilities between Manchester and London, and extra trains have been laid on by both the Great Northern and North-Western*ines. At a meeting of the ILanelly it was resolved to raise a sum of 10,0001. to form a Waggon Improvement Company, and half of the capital was at once subscribed by the shareholders present. The report stated that the opening of the Llandilo Extension has produced a favourable effect on the traffic; an addition of seven miles of railway having more than doubled the earnings. The Vale of Towy was progressing towards completion, and negotiations for working that line were pending. At the North Staffordshire meeting, the chairman complained of the impediments thrown in their way by the London and North-Western, which had caused a decrease in the direct through traffic; the local traffic, however, showed a considerable increase. An agreement by which the Cannock line was guaranteed 4i per cent. on 110,0001., and which woould have given the North Staffordshire an outlet to Wolverhampton, had been repudiated by the former company in consequence of an offer by the North-Western of a 5 per cent. guarantee. The land had been purchased for the Biddulph brancb, and the works would be commenced in a few months. A dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum was declared. The Peebles Company bave determined on creating a preference stock of 27,OOO, to provide the capital required to meet the expense of working the line. The London Discount Company have issued a report preparatory to their meetino, on Tueday. The profits for the half-year are stated at 3,8321., and this sum is recommended to be carried forward, the directors conidering it too ealy to declare a dividend. The profit and lo-s account shows au item of unpa s of 6,9901., against which 3,4951. iS reserve To ium. b estllul The Atrato, West India steamer, will take out about 20,0001., chiefly in gold.

Robert Barbour and Brother:- " The inadequate supply of raw matera continues to disturb the course of business here. During the past month another considerable advance has taken place in the Liverpeol cotton-nmarket, which has placed spinners and manufac. tiir%extienlarly the Atter, in a atOll more unstisf.actory odtion than formerly. They have, however, in most cases ben able to establish an advance of 2t to 5 per eent., and stocks are kept light by the decreased production. The demand for India is at present almost suspended, but other markets, both horne and fore3gn, are taking their usual sup. lies.

A GOOD ExAnpE.-A prosecution, airected by the Attorney-General, for gross abuse of magisterial autbo. rity is a sign of the improved times in which we livo. Formerly the endeavours of the law officers of the Crown would have been to screen an offence of the class we are about to describe; but to bring it to justice has been the upright duty of Sir R. Bethell. The case was this. George Sporra and John Story trespased In pmrsuit of _gne on the laud of Mr. Robert Belany, of the county of Darham, a justice of the peace. The men are brought before MT. Bellany, who takes cognizance in his character of magistrate of the trespas agalnst his private rights of property. He tells tho Erlsoners that nvlws3 they pay each 1t. they will be taken to nchester and looked up, and the next day brought before the iustlce, and fined 40s. 'and costs. Without giving the men time to answer Mr. Bellmny asks the comtable "w hether he has got the materials," meaning, it seems, the hand. cuffs; sad on a reply in the affirmative, he osders him to pug the two men in irols. Sporrs and Story in handcuffi, and having the fear of being locked up before them, ask permis. idon -to go whore they can :3rae the money demanded by Bellny, whilch they do, and obtain{ their release, the magictrate stating, when pocketing the money, that he was not flinig the men, and that nothing was due to the county, the whole amount being damages for the trespass on his land. 'Upon these facts the indictment chrgedlBellaywithextort. ingmoneybyvirtueof his offlice, and with corruptly applying the money tohis own use, after conpoundi, glegal offence, For the defence it was contended that Bellany had only exercised his civil right of compromising a wrong done to his property, that he had imposed no fine, but simply taken compensation for a damage But it i- clear that he had extorted the money by the use and abuse of his magisterial authority, without which he oould not have ordered the men to be handcuffed, and threatened them with immediate imprisonment and the penalties of 406. with costs the next day. Such was the view beth the judge and Jnry took of the case, and the vesdict accordingly WBS-" guRlty of extorting the money corruptly under colour of the magisterisl olce," OE course this verdict will be followed by the immediate removal of MIr. BeUany from the commission of the peace. Forty years ago resort would have been had to every device to hush up and screen such a case of misconduct a this, and the plea would have been the avoidance of scandal and savizg the character of the magistracy, but the present high legal authorities are of opinion that the character of the magistracy is best preserved by delivering the body of any unworthy members. The pitiful nature of the tern tatlon, a few shilings, gives a peouliar stamp to Mr.! Belny's offence; ad it is to be obeerveE that he xtorted this price, not for any damage reaUy done to his game, but for the trespass, with the intent unrealized of poaching a rabbit.-Aiasuner.

BmM3INtGRAM Auo. I The reports from the manufacturing distrcts represent the iron tde to be steady, and prioes wel supported. The furnacesare aotively employed, and foreign ordess moie e aid to be on the increase. nhe l1t two advances in the price of tin are now be. nriing to operate injuriously upOn the manufactres of tin warea. Large wakoys are not inlined +t purchase a% present rates, and a reduction of work is consequently anticipated There is a decided improvement in the brass foandry businsesses,and fromthe lowness of stocks another advance in the edoee of copper is deemed not imrobable. For this reson sbe meeting of Amelters to be he d on Wednesday next is looked forrd to wth considerable interest. Amiralty lrders for marine tubes have been given out, and the greatest elepatchis requiredis nthesrdelivery. General brass founryd of household articles S6 also imsprOVig. The activity of the metalzollers dimbcateas strongy the healJthy condition of the tae. The nillitny, gun trade at the present tiuas exhibits the greates activity. The orders for carbines reoently received for the Indian anmy are proceeding with extraordinary despatch, and the best underst&ndrnF rotwithstnding late lsagreesentis anow saidto exist bween the Ordoance suthorsties, contrsot6Ms and operatives. The season for the ibirding gun manufacture is now at ita height, and our chiet saakeris ire well employed. The aocounts of the general country trade in hardware re favourable rather than otherwise. Orders for vdater stocks ase numeroas, if not heavy, and if the prices of metals were more settled a large autumu bsieSs 'Would be tran acted. The CollinsiCompany of America have Instituted roceed.

Now, however, the exctement c*used by the late proceedings has for the mot part sub. aided, our chief munufactuers consider that the effect, although temporarily injurious,will not ultimately be of any Eesious consequence to the British manufacturer of edged tools.

Reports from the foundries in the neighbourhood of Dudley, Westbromwich, and Brierly.hill speak favorbly of the state of tlade in thoe localitie&s The forges are for the roost part at work, and the numerous and varied muannfactring establishments of these districts exhibit symptoms of incrcsed aotivity. At Reddito the rneedle manufacturers are extremiely busy, and in the neighbourhood of Stotrbridge the chairmakers are nore than sally busy. Judging from the goods traffio upon the canals and various railways of the district, al branches of manufacture are more than ordinarily brisk. At a general meeting of the proprietors of the Birmingham Canal, held yesterday (at which a dividend of 21. upon the old shares, and 1U. 7s. d. upon the new shares, ws declared), it was stated that the revenue of the canal for the last six rnouths considerably exceeded anything it had ever reached before. Similar state. ments are made by managers of local railways. XOTTRIGHAM.'5 Thetre is a little -more doing in the lace trade this week; businessA however, is by no means brisk; this is usually a flat season of the year, and there is about an average amomnt of business doing.

The reports of the woollen cloth trade of this distrit are about as satisfactory as can be expected. There was an average attendance of merchants this morning, and in ea. sonable goods a modeorate business was transacted. The wirehouses are doing a pretty steady trade for the home inarket, though they have scarcely been so well employed this week as last. The export houses have ver fair orders an band.

In cobtton arns ralter mtore dealings are reported, with a corresponditg pimarovesent in tho pricos obtained. T'cere is hardly so muchl doing in the wool-market; in fact the business in combing wools appears to have received a teinperary check, occasioned partially by the finnaess of prices demanded by the staplers, 'whose pretensions are cones ded with very great reluctance, although there can bs little question that they must ultimately be submitted to, and also by the fact that our spinners have in their recent purchases laid in no inconsiderable qUaantity ofE the raw material to sutpply thwe p resent requirements of trade. The demand can only be caed a rnoderate one for the time of ienr. The business done, all things considered, is tolerably o sully as dear~asthose of the previous 'Week, Clothing wools meet with a steady demand, and last week's rates are very firmly adhered to in ready sales, with on advance in some instances. BBLFAST, JVLY 3. Linen.-We have no alteration to notice in any branch of this trade. The assizes and races combined have inter. rupted the general coulrse of business. Linen yarn in better demuand and prices firm. Flax.-A very large supply of flax appeared in Bardbay last week, consiadering the lateness of the season, upwards of EO tons being exposed in the streets for sale, all of which waseagerly bought ap at hig,l pitces. All the other markets had but a smill supply in tbem. Cotton.-In the market for goods there has been a steay zalo, but no advance? which scarcely meets the extra cost of arnS. Some turn as felt witb Belfast markets for muslin -of the lighter fabrics, and mulls as well as lawns are looked for. Exports of finest goods do not fal off, and the opening -up of more exttensve markets in the Urated States gives hopes of enlarge sales of plainandfancygoods for several -cities of the great Republic.

Mr. E. JTAoNs, iii opening th case, stated that mi. Glovex had contestedA Be'erley inlilo2, but had been deioated; that in 1854 he oontested Canterbury, but was again defeated; and that he again tood for Beverley at the lst election. He was called upon tato his qualification, and hie then claimed to be qualiaed in respeot of certain lands sibtuated in Ireland and of some proper in Kent. It Would, hoWover, be proved that the lands in Ireland specified by Mr. Glover, and formerly owned by his father5 hvd been Tested in awaignees by an order of the Irish Insolvency Court in 1850, but they were encumbered beyond their value, and that the Encumbered Estates Court had in 185I directed that they should bh eola. The property in Rent in respect of which Mlr. Glover claimed formerly belonged partly to a gentleman named Poker, a captain in the navy, who had married a Mrs De Burgh, said to be an aunt of Mr. Glover's, and partlt to a sir, Mblss Pokese. A lease o2 this property was represented by Kr. Glover to have been granted to him by Mr. and Miss Ftker. It would, however, be proved that the pro perty in Kent ia respect of which lx. Gelovee e-a:me& to be qualified was now in the possesaion of mort- agzes The learned counsel concluded by aserting that 0r. Glover hrad made a wilful misrepresentatioIn in the statement of qusalication hehA aigne&a tYhe tixn of t'he election, that 'Mr. Poker, a nephew of the gentleman whom he had ruined, bad challenged hbim to meet him ptublicly on the question of qualification, bat that Mr. Glover had declined the challenge, and that Mr. Wells vas therefore enititled to the hseat of which ^Mr. Glovr had wrongfull3r obtained possession. A great deal of documentary evidence was given in sup. port of the case opened by the leered counsel, ana Mr. Foker, a proctr of Doctors'-commons and ne he;v of Captain Foker, was then. called, and said that on tearing of M. Glover'sintention to stand for Beverley he commaidcated with Colonel Hutton a,nd Messrs. Bolton and Sheppard, and i8sued a handbill to the electos, stating, among other things, that Mr. Glover had not a 51. qualfcation. He also went down to Beverley and offeredito make good his statements at the hutings, but ws advised not to do so, as Mr. Martin, a barrister, who had gone down with the sarue object, had been maltreated the people. While at Beverley he was chased and pelted with stones by a mob and obh to remain in a houem wbere 'e bad taken refuge unti nearly niidaight. On being cross-examined by Mr. SLADn hE said he did not put his name to the handbMI because a profesional friend advised him not to do so. Re went down to Beverley becaue he thought it was his duty to exrpose a man whom he looked upon as a great impostor. He was prepared to prove every statement he had made in the handbill Mr, Brereton, the Mayor of Beverley and rehuring officer, proved thAt it waa matter of notoriety inthe borough that Mr. Glover's qualifLication had been called in question. Some other witnesses having been examined upon the same point, as to the notoriety of the dispute respecting Mr. Glover's qualification, The committee then adjourned. At the sitting of the committee on Saturday furthez ewcdance was given as to the ntotoriety of the question raised respecting htr. Glover's qualfication previous to the election. Mr. TIIDAL Avnnsow then addressed thc eommuitts on behalf of the sitting member. He expressed his regret that Mr. Jamnes, in his opening address, had made several assertions, of which no proof had been given, respeoting matters quite irrelevent to the question wiEich the committee had to decide, merely with the view of exoiting a prejudice against the sitting member. The matter in dispute resolved itself entirely into a question of figurs-had Mr. Glover a qualification of 300L a-year? He should submit that Mr. Cilover did possess that qualification in respect of the pro. perty in Kent, which was not affected by the Irish insolvenoy. He also contended that the anonymous placard issued by Mr. Foker was not a sufficient notice to ict electors that an objection had keen raised to Mlr. Glover's qualification. He suggested that his learned friend had been instructed to enter into matters unconnected with these ques6 tions because the solicitors who instructed bi-epeetable gentlemen, no doubt-were angry that any one should venture to come forward as a candidate for Beverley who possessed no territorial influence in the neighbourhood.

The committee appointed to inquire into the petition against the return of Mr. Grogan and rr. Vance met on Friday. The members are Mr. Ayr'ton, the Hon. R. H. Dutton, the Earl of Gifford, the Hon. F. Scott; chairman, Mr. T. E. Headlanm. The petition, which is signed by electors of the city, contained allegations of bribery, corrupt practices, and treat ing, and prays that the return of Mr. Crogan and Mr. Vance | may be declared null and'sood. Counsel for the petitioners, Mr. E3dwin James, lr. Phinn, anud Mr. 3Iacdonough and Mr. Coffee. of the Irish bar; counsel for the sitting ebes M. O'Malley r. Slade and Mr. Rodwell. ~ ~ ~ Mr.Slaer Mr. E. JAU3S opened the case as one of bribery and corruption. The constituency of Dublin, be said, contained about 10,000 electors, a large proportion of whom were freemen. These freemen were, as vould be proved, an extre'ely venal body. At the last election the sitting members were opposed by Mr. Reynolds, who formerly represented the city, and by Mr. Brady, the son of the Lord chancellor of Irelaud. The result of the polling was-Grogan, 3,767; Vance, 3,71.1; Brady, ,405 ; and Reynolds 3,348. The number of freemen in the constituency was 2,987, and and of these about 1,900 polled for Messrs. Grogan and Vance, an(d not more than 348 for the other candidates. It would be shown that a number of these freemen, for the purpose of increasing the value of their support, formed themselves into a compact body, calling tbemselves the "Protestiant Feemen's Be)lowsup Association," and that a regular system of bribery was organized in order to induce them to vote. This society, whic-h consisted of 300 or 400 members, was formed, be believed, after the election of 1.2, in tonaequeuce, probably, of the sup. port of the freemen not having been purchased at that election. The society had a president, a vice-president, a physician, a treasurer, and a chaplain, and its proceedings were opened with prayer. The meetings of the society were held at rooms in Ross-lane, where, on the night before the election, the members were addressed by Mr. Vance. The conductors of the electInn on behalf of Messrs. Grogan and Vance adopted these t olms in Ross-lane as their tally rooms during the election, and freemen were taken thence to the poll. The suns of money actOlly paid to the freemen were small, but large promisen were made to them, and they were told to keep quiet until the expiration of the time for lodging petitions, about the 21st of May. In addition to this organized and systematic bribery there were several individual cases, sorae of which the learned counsel stated. le ealo ai that hA fireemen wbo could neither read nor write had been tar-en from the workhouse and employed as poU clerks by the agents of the Sitting members. At the conclusion of the learned counsel's address, the usal formal proof of the writ =&d the return was giveL Michael Byrne, a voter, was then called, and stated that he had been canvassed by Mr. Whithorn, a solicitor, for the sitting members, that before he voted lir. Whithorn pcromised him 5?., an.d took hm to the committee room in Ross-lane, and that after voting he was pid 31. in notes, by two persons whom he did not know, at a publichouse. George Moulds, a law clerk, said that a person named COuikshank had asked him whether he could make Out a case in support of the petition, that he had replied that he could, and had drawn up a written statement (produced) to the effect that two voters named Reeves had been bribed with 21. each by Dr. Hatfield. On cross-exsamination, horwever, the witness said that thi wrItten statement was altogether untrue, and, the committee hnvin; thereupsc, in'tinattd thlat t)aey coul(d not believe anything that he stated in evidence, he was orderedi to withdrawv. ¶W.

Some of them, more espeo raully the scenes from Moli6re's L'.As'are, Sheridan, and Shakspeare, were adniirably rendered and received with the most hearty applause, for all the numerous audience could appreciate the truth and point with which the varied dellxeations were performed.

It is understood that Sir James propoee to come forward as a c-andidate in the Conservative interest, and It reeas probable that he would do so in conjunction with Sir Bdmund Lacn, who represented the borough from 1852 to 1857, Last evening a Tery lage open-air meeting, held in front of the Star Hotel, was a .ed for near three hours by M7r. Watk}n, who reviewed his Totes and speeches in Par liament, protested against the constitution of the committee which had just sat onL the groutnd that It did not consis of gentlemen of big class or political opinions, and contended that the evidence adduced was notsuchas to justify a bondfldc popula triumnh being pronounced a null and void election. r, Wat=in also stated that on Wednesday evening aL meeting attended by Mr. 'Cullagh and himself, anad 13 other gentlemaen mnore or less connected with Yarmouth, waa held at the Reforma Club for the purpoee of concerftng measure with regad to the future representation of the constituency.

T1ix Cm ov DzLn.-The following deseript4on of Delhi appeas in the lahore Gaa tte:-" The city i aurrounded by a high crenelated wall, in a deep dit and glacis. At the Cashmeree-gate only is there anything' of Iodemn fortification; here there is asimple baion. with properly-cut embrasures. t, is enclosed, and forms the maik guard. The city meres about two miles aros, anm is some seven or eight miles in cirnumference; on the east dU the waisare washed by the Jumns. The palace i xa commanding position, and, though the wals are not eaI=. lated to resist heavy artillery, yet the place oald be taken without a breach being made tbem-that is,ir ihe gxarson ahowed any sl fin its defence. Theeap . of sunh a pae is a simple matter of time, and its fall might be calculated toan hour; but everything, of course, depends upon the plan of defenoe adopted by the garrson. It p "osible that they may risk attle ob ide the bA which caso, after their defeatl they night be followedlsto the city and into the palae, and so Ddiii might be taken by a rush, but as our force is so very smal, and such mighty consequences hang upon the success of our attk, the very greatest risk would be Incurred by having cur men exposed to musketry fire from houses, for a zativex fire from a loophole is more than a match for a Earopen in the open. To sae the walls would be ea6y; but no object would be gained by pouring our handful of troops into a sea of houes, with streets barricaded; koea loss would unquestionably follow. This mode of att -would be asurd, and would certainly end In disomfitmer. There are two modes of attack, howerer, which counld no well fail, and I fancy that one or the other must be sdoptdb. The first is to attack the palace at gnoe from the iver sid for the water until the end of the month Is so very low, an is little more than a strean which Is fordable, that it oula create no obstacle worth mentioning. The batteriesb ioul be erected on the sand, and the camp being across the river 'would be sbte. By sheling the palace andlbrealdug its new 'wall an assault could be madeo, and the fire of our gu5 would continue till our troops had fairly got in. The shel ibg vould have destroyed all cover, and probably would have d2iven out the delendants, so that there is little doubt but that the assault would be successfl. Haiving got possesdon of the palace the city falls at once. There is, however, t a chance of the river rising suddenly, -when the batteries would be destroyed, so that this attack entirely depends upon the ziver and the probabllity of its rise. The nett and afeat mode of attack, and the one that in '1A likelihood will be the one adopted, fs to attackl near the C-abmeree-gate. The advantage is th% that Oir left would be prteeeted by the river-a great considration in asall ceamop. Our gumn 'would soon xendtr the main guard untenable, and to make a practicble breach In the wall betw,een the Cashmere. gate and the river would bea very simple operation. Or advano would then be made in the open, and with litLo risk of loss from the lire of musketry from houses, forowing to the explosion in the -magAzine it is probable that fromi the church to the palace all has been leveUed. Oer obijet then would be to breach the plae in ita north wall, mortar all the time doing their work. To torm the palae. would close tlhe proceeding. As the garrison have so few artiWlerynen it does not seem likely that their defenoe into rest in their guns. They 'will trust to nuaketry fire frbm houses; in all probability they have undeimined all the gates, and their plan wi be to Inflict upon us as much-16e as they can while gradually falling baekl when they 'rAII . hope to escape with their treanre, d aIng In every _Qc.= tion immediately they leave the walls.

LONDON, MONDA4Y, AUGUST 3 1857. "The Bengal Native Army has ceased to xisb." We repeat the summary of the Indian news in the same form in which we gave it on Saturday. The list of disbanded and revolted reghnents is undoubtedly portentous, aud can only be described in this way. And now that is the conclusion we are to gather from this fact? Is it a menlcbojy one ? Are wq to begin trembling for our Indias, n]mpire? We think t'ne natural conclusion from.f&:act is quite the contrary to a mnelanoboly one. . The truth is, the very extent of the mutiny is the'raoat satisfctory evidence we colnid possibly have that this is a mnil*ry mrutipy, and nothing more. lIad there mei the slightest wish on the put of the ipoptvlation at lArge tQ.*e'up againmt our G1overra?gt there .npt )ve -been iommp9p'1A Q4utbrk Wetm,o, now, 0 so widespread aemu nyl-isi6 XeUli$a and`eb a it. TeI' 'ri it of' iYewioeI iRagiy army oZ a Presidencvy must have a-wkeyed M embers of a national rebellion wrea4A ' awake. '¢e know that 3tew ffavel,very rapidly in India, and that the mass of th'e people. is speedily informed of such paising events s intex e. them. With so large a numbor of, utinee6th then, let loose'among the mus of tho populatio.4 there must bave been by this timni full knomw ledge of the mutiny and of its extent. Well, then, the wutchword of rebellion has beent raised, and it has fallen dead upon the native population. This'is a military mutiny. Itr is nothing more. These soldiers stand alone with their flag of revolt, and nobody joins t,hem. In this state of the.: case the greater the number of the Mutineers, the weaker is their ground.; the more succeeftil this movement is as a military revolt, the legs it. approaches to a national one. We have the data before us for a diagnosis, and We know now the nature of the disease. Ha ' the mutiny been less wide we might have thought that the native population was waiting till it became wider ; but, having come to such a head. as it has without producing any effect upot - the native population, it tells its.own history, .*nd we have only to repeat that it is a miltA.. revolt, ad nothing more. This is satisfactory in many ways. ..;-Everv reader of history knows what sort of tin a militay revolt is, that it is a totally diflere'nt hiug from; a. national. one; totaly distinct. in itt --otive4 and object. The ordunary motive of a ntsonat revolt is indignation at oppression ; * is the wish to shake off some grinding yoke which interferes with happiness, and which can be borne no. longer. Had this revolt in'India, then, spritg from the people in the first instance, there would hvve been, at any rate, a strong primQ fade ground that we had beei maltreating them, and that outr gov"ernment had been oppressive and unjust. But the motive of a military mutiny is stobition. Large bodies of men awaken on some oecasion to the knowledge that they have arms in their hands, that they knowv hov to use them, and that they outnumber theirnasters. They are well-fed and well-clothed, acoustomed to a comfortable life, and have not to work I too much, for it.. Their courage rsaes some fine morning' as they look dowti. tbear lites and.see.that they have all the mi ry bxternals that their masters have. The idea oirs to a few reAtless spirits '-" Why should we not try our "chance of a new position ? It is a shame that Osuch fine fellows a We are should have neglected "our opportunity so long. There is a 'srong "place there; let us seize it, set up some "ruler of our own, and govern Tndi in his " name. There is the old Modu there; he is just " the man for us, he is the centre of ,awide circle I " of national and traditional associations, the " people will catch at his name, and anticipate a " return of gld times and old triumphs." This military revolt ha4 exactly the look of such 'a. movement as this. A number, of soldiers seize Delhi, set up the old MOGUL, and raie thetandard of rebellion. The object of -the whole aftl is trans- parent. Were they successful thelle meu, would, of; course, form the new rulers of India. IThey would mae their puppet. in -Delhi .aigx wh%at ed.icts they pleased, and-instantly put: themnIveo in posseAsion of the vrhole p6wer andc patrgnage of the empire. There would be so ma#,v satrapies. vacant, so many grand places at cout4and camp to .be distributed a-mong the lndian !'etorians. it is satisfactory, theu,i to -find that this' ' X of ambition, and no resut of t natural motives which ha,ve so often excited just and patriotio rebellion, and therefor, hoCe*idence. of any cirse in our own' adminst,fion to excite: such m6tiv-ea-no evidence against the jurstices and benevolen-ewof our own past g4vexnmennt` Iindia. But it is also satisfactory to find "is out, becuhe * a uVilit&ry mutiny is a decidedly manageable thiag. Whatever difficulties a natioxal revolt might oc3sion, a simply military outbreak is; a thing ve can put down. There can be no doubt about that; and: for thatreasonwe say that even themnew of the'widespread character of this movaement Is satisfactory, a8 deciding the question of the nature and character of it. . The great questioh to be asked abowt it is is it a national revolt, or is it a military one? If it is the latter our mindcs are so far relieved, atd-the news of its wide growth, without any acoomnpanyifig response from the people, stamps it so much the more clearly as a military revolt only. The native Princes evidently regard it as suQh, They feel no inclination to join, and very naturally, because, in the first place, they do not think it will succeed; and, in the nextplace, they cannot wish it to succeed. They know well enough what the first act of their neow masters at Delhi would he-viz., to oust them from their thrones and sabstitute soine new made men and rough soldiers of fortune in their places. A rebellious natiom in a victorious contest with a dominant stranger retains its, native Princes, but a rebellious atmnj unseats them, as a matter of course. But even as a military outbreak this mutiny has its weak points. It' is confined to one Presidency, it has secured no great leader. If SCIDIrA or EOLRAx had put himself at the head of it, we should have thought worse of it than we do. All that we see at present is that the native nobility and rank of Indianstand aloof from it. Reinforceaents have before now begun to pour in in rapid succession, and in a short time a much larger force will be collected to keep India than waas even used in conquering it. We are sending a steam fleet unexampled, except in the. Black Sea three years since. The'Chinesa War,. as it happens, has fitted in most harmoniously with the emergem cy, and ha already.a,upplied our Indian Siny aviy.h ma rei± ; Ther Genrnuniont At ;Iome, too ins %ctmn with, an energy equal to the occasion. It is imposible to auppose that a country which a hundred years ago conquered Hindostan should now, with resources multiplied indefinitely, and with all the wei-ht of intcrmediate prestige, be unable* to mnaintain it-that a Power which is it least ten times greater than that which gained an empire cannot quell a.mutiny in its own army. It will require great sacrifioes, of course. We do not dissemble our conviction that the cost both in men and money will be great, but for this the countl$' is prepar4d, and with thege success is certain. . I .
If we did not know beforehand how far con. cession to iiidoo prejudices and leniency to Ein. - doo offences had been carried we might now leara, it. The whole histork of the greased cartridges has nowl beentold, and the public may see what. maninef of men the Indian Government have to deal with, and how, hopelew it is to attempt to disabuse a half-instructed race of prejudice3 which favoiur their impatience of control and their love of turbulence. The correspondence just laid before Parliament begins with a letter from MajorGeneral INAnuY, at ;Barrackpore, to the DeputyAdjutant-General- at Calcutta, atting that at Dindum an unnleasAha fQeling exIsted' nong the native p61Hioy; A, the menx att6cwwed to the DepOt for' instruiction ri ie pit ctj. e t auieeby tbp be1iet that . tib'g±;p i1e ii 4. &e. pep4tioii of She baiXlstrdgesi consisted do s tfue oTtbb fdtJof pig# And aos .Gen-e.at H^AnSEY aq?.g iaglyr- rnwO. t 4~ the Qflel somIu bi~ A*e Rifie" 'Dep6t 1iiay be' kioThoi' fo abtain ~*||;th'& BaAIt ivlhatever .ingredients may be *~iejeassr whieh the Sepoys may be allowed to lFke upthbmselveas.' Frohj an6ther letter, wnitten -silanuay 22, we learn the probable beginning of the delusi6o, A "clasie" of lo* c_ate,asked a Sepoy bf .the 2d Grenadiers to xupply him with water from liii "Iota." The Brahmin refused, on the ground that the other would defile the vesseL The ' classie" rejoined that he need not plide himself on his cute, for he would soon lose it, as he would ere long have to bite cartridges covered with the fat of pigs and cows. The report spread, and the men-were everywhere afraid that when they went home. their friends would refuse to eat with them. At DIumdum the native portion of the troQpps wet~ paraded aud asked if they wished Lto prefer any complaints; at least two-tlhirds of. the detachment stepped to the front, including all the non-commissioned officers; they stated their objections in a sufficiently respectdul manner, suggesting the use of wax and oil. The answer of the Government was not long in coming. The concession was immediate and comXplete- .The officer in comma-nd of the Dep6t was aUlthorized to obtain from the Bazaar the ingredients necessary for the greasing of the buUet, which ther men themselves were to be permitted to make lip! But already the Sepoys had proceeded to xhutinous exicoses. . General HEAnszy writes that a bid feeling prevails at Barrackpore, caused by a report, spread probably by the " Dhurma Sobha," a religious Hindoo party in CalcLtta, that it was the design of Government to convert the soldiers to Christianity by force. Contemporaneously with the spread of this notion a sergeant's bungalow was burnt down at Raneegunge, and three incendiary fires took place at Barrackpore in four days, one of tlwem destroying the electric telegraph bungalow. The writer adds that perhaps the party who are averse to the remarriage of widows is using these means to embarrass the Government. It was, however, determined to heir what the men had to say. A special Court of Inquiry was held at Barrackpore. for the purpose of ascertaining from the evidence of a selected portion of the 2d Native Grenadier Regiment the cause of their continued objection to the paper of which the new rifle cartridges were composed. The Court met on the 6th of February at Barrackpore. BYJOIATn PAwDIE, a Sepoy, was called and examined. He was asked if he had made any objections to the 'cartridges. He answered that he felt a picion that the paper mi,ght affect his caste. On being asked his reason for this Buspicion, he answered that it was a new kind of paper, and one which he had not seen before; " he " hadheard that there was some fat in the paper ; it " was aBazaar report." He is then asked to exanine the paper carefully in the light, and explain to the Ootnrt what he sees objectionable in it. He rays his suspicion proceeds from the paper being tiffancl like cloth, and from its tearing differently from the old paper in use. It .ppears that the paper being thin and well-sized the Sepoys thought, or pretended to think, it was manufactured with Eome forbidden animal substance. CHLTD KHL&N, Sepoy, also objects to the paper, " because it is t6 itougk and' burns as if there were grease u, Ui;. *-1$' The follQwing phenomenon, according to this WitneSs s, had caused much dismay in the Regi- :7-. r On the evening of the 4th inst. a piece f' of thetartridge paper was dipped in water, and 'j then-'buirnt. When burning it made a fizzing " noise, aid smielt as if there were grease in it." A. piece 9f the paper is burnt in court, and COAUD ahltIe'tb t say greases but, being' .sIki d' lpAioxxdtaI rehtained, he saas "Yes, ' o-ject to`thisi aper being used, as every one " is dissatisfied with it on account of its being " glazed, shining -like wax-cloth." Su'bahdar KflADTJ Bjft'sj '< 2has ilo objection to the cartridge itself, ` tit there is a general report in the cantonment " that tiepaer is made up with fat.", Jemadar 'o u ,s ays, " l There is grease in it, I feel C assuived, as it differs from the paper which has "-heretofore been always. used for cartridges." Another witneEs has no objection to biting the cartiidge, but could not do it, as the other men Wo674d 'pb3ect to it. So ended this ridiculous -inquiry, in which we see the perversity and folly 'of;'an ignorant race encouraged by the concession whiich has been Already made to their murmurs and 'threats. -. authorities might well feel surprised that, after an all6wance had been authorized for the puiheas6 and preparation of a harmless grease, Sepoys should transfer their suspicions to the paper itself. But, with our present knowledge, it is impossIble to doubt that cartridges and Christianity were only the excuse for displaying a longcherished discontent, or at niost merely gave the last impulse to the movement. On the 10th of February a Jemadar of the 34th Regiment revealed the pr6oebaings in which he had borne a part. Hie deposed that on the 5th, the day before the Court of Inquiry in which the Sepoy witnesses figured, two or three men had come to him and made him accompany them to the paradeground, where he found a great crowd assembled, composed of the men of the different regiments at the station. They had their heads tied up with cloths, so that only a small part of 'the face was exposed. They said they were determined-to die for their religion, and that " if "they could make an arrangement that evening "the next night they would plunder the station "and kill all the Europeans, and then they could "go where they liked." About 300 men were 'assembled. This state of things continued until, on: tlie 2fth of Febru3ry, Lieutenant-Colonel XIonzru Ordere?4 the 1 9th Regiment to parade on the following -mor-ing. The percussion caps were to Be issued that evening. When the time came the snej refused to roooive thom. The Colonel erdere& that-the- 11th- Reginent of-larel Cavalry should be on the spot to intinmidate the mutineers, if necessary, and 'that the guns should be present at the same time. Between 10 and 11 o'clock the men of the 19th Regiment broke open the bells of arms, took possession oI their muskets and ammunition, and carried them to their -fines. The next day the guns were got ready, and the officers proceeded to the paradeground, where they found the men in undre4s, but armed, formed, in line, and shouting. The officers were threatened if -they-came on. Lieutenant-Colonel MrToBLL then commahided them to lay down their arms. The native officers said the men would- refuse to do so in presence of the Artillery and Cavalry. These were then withdrawn, and the men yielded. The PRegiment was subsequently disbanded. We may I.ake this as an instructive episode in our Indian 'history.' Here is our Government making one concession after another, appointing Chynical Commiions to inquire into the composition of cartridges, and promising the men everything if t t1hey w1 remain faithful, and all to no purpose. But the first time these same men are' met boldly :by a suffacient force they yield, in spite of religion and caste and pride of birth. This is certainly a lesson by which we may profit in the government of India.
tngiand i8 at present in conflict with the -Ea m ern orld. F'oRM Aden to Hongkong the 'hrtish flag hs ben unturled, and at various apots :fbrough6ut This great ,ecti9ua of the globe the j inlbitants of these, litt1e islands are actually en- t,aed i-uhostilities with well-nigh one half of tlhe hun3fil ace. A*f4 as Persia ihaeed iFs conobnred the struggle to all iparauce is at an end. Had the intelligence of the, Sepoy insprection reached the earsof thePersiauMonirchbefoiepeaceheabnooncitlded, coloured and distorted asit wrtuld iBecessarly have been by the diplomatistsaof Russia, we snght .have looked for a continuafice of that wa, *but, peace once concluded, war will scarcely be renewed. Of the unhappy occurrences Xi Bitish India we speak elsewhere; for our present' purpo4e it is sufficient to state that throughout the NorthWestern Provinces of Br Inahia and down the courses of the Juimna and the Ganges a neces3ity exists for asserting the supremacy of the British name. But while this great and lamentable affair is in progress we must not lose sight of the fact that far away to the eastward 1British ships of war are engaged with another enemy. Tho forces which hd been directed on this last scene of aotion have been arrested, and diverted from their appointed destination to meet the exigencies of a conflict of a far more momentous kind. The intelligence of the Sepoy mutiny has been of so absorbing a nature that the British public have almost forgotten the existence of that contest in the(iAuton river which but a few months, almost a few weeks back, was judged of sufficient importance to justify an appeal to the country. The Plenipotetitiary whom we have despatched to the gates of China must make his appearance there 'with curtailed strength, for the regiments which were to accompany or precede him have been removed from his control. Under these circumstances it. is of the highest interest to know that Admiral a SEnnioua is holding his own against the turbulent Government of Canton. The city of Canton lies ready for British occupation, and if it be ifnposible or impolitic to take possession of it at once-as we surely must take possession of it in the end-and to prescribe the terms upon which the intercourse of the two nations shall henceforth be conducted, it is a comfort to know that, in this quarter at least, no irreparable mischief is in progress. We can bide our time; the treacherous Sepoy will not in the end be found to have materially assisted the cause of the Chinese. On Saturday last we published a letter from our special correspondent, who was present at the operations he records. By this it will be seen that the Chinese war junks, which may be taken to represent the effective naval force at the disposal of the Cantonese authorities, have been destroyed by the sailors and Marines of the British fleet, and that the direct passage from Hongkong to the city of Canton itself is as open aa the course of the River Thames from the Nore to Loedon-bridge. The operations were conducted on the first occasion by Commodore Erwor, on the second by the Admiral himself, well backed by the gallant Krrran and the principal officers of the fleet. Of the first of these two series of operations but little need be said, for, although conducted with the utmost alacrity and spirit, the affair was not of so decisive and momentous a character as the second encounter. On the 25th of Mlay, however, Conunodore ELLioT, with. certain gunboats, steamed into one of the creeks which are marked as running from the Canton river eastward. Intelligence had been received that a large fleet of Mandarin junks was lying up this creek, and againrst these it was intended to direct an attack. When the little flotilla had advanced about five miles up the creekl the war junks of the Chinese, more than 40 in number, were descried. They were moored acroas the stream,' with their bows towardstheaasailants. Each junk carried a 32-lb. gun forward, and, beides this, each was armed with from four to ix ninepounders. meo gunbsoas opepid their fire, Which for a time iwas returned with considerable -spirit and the Chinese fled. In so doing they became almost powerless, for in their flight the action of the 32-pounder forward was neutralized. In the end 16 junks were taken and destroyed in the main creek; 13 escaped by swift rowing, and 10 were burnt in a narrow creek through which they were endeavouring to make good their flight. The' Commodore, however, would not resign the hope. of completing his work, and, having the next day stopped, as he supposed, all the adits of these strange waters, he took his flotilla up a channel, where he hoped to find the junks not yet accounted' for. For a considerable time his labour proved vain, bat at length, leavingthe flotilla behind, and attended only by his armed boats, he pulled for a pagoda which had been made out in the distance. On a sudden, and to their great surprise, the British sailors and Mlarines found theraselves abreast of a large and populous city, close to which was anchored a fleet of junls. These were destroyed to the number of 12, the Marines landing in the city to drive out the Chinese, who were firing from the houses on the boats, So ended this brilliant little operation; but the Battle of Fatshan was a far more serious affair. The details of this action have been so fuly described by our correspondent that it would be superfluous to repeat them here. It will be sufficient to state that two miles from the mouth of the Fatshan branch of the Canton rivet there is a long island caUed Hyacinth Island. On the left bank opposite to that island there is a steep hill, and upon that hill there is or was a fort. Higher u1p than the island there are two smaler tributaries of the Fatshan branch, which go away right and left. On the lot of June-a date not unknown in the annals of the British Navy -Admiral SnysouR nnd his folowers found that 19 large guns had been mounted on the fort. A six-gun battery had been erected on the right bank of the river. Above the island, across the channel, and along the two smaU crceks,72 junks were moored, in such a way that their bow guns swept the channel on either side of Hyacinth Island. It had been so arranged that, as the British advanced to the attack along these channels, the fire of the fort, of -the battery, and of the junks should be concentrated upon them. The fort was the key of the position. On the 1st of June, then, " in the stiU black night," a little after 3 o'clock, the Coromandel, with Admiral SnYMoua aboard, towing the boats containing the Marines, who were to land under the fort and to carry it, moved on. The Coromandel was then to dash in among the junks, the gunboats and rowboats following. When the steamer had arrived at somewhat less than a mile from the fort her advance was noted by the enemy. A rocket shot up into the air, and the action began. Whon the Coromandel had made her way up to Hyacinth Island ia the face of the fire, and was drawing near to the fort, she took the ground. Commodore KEPPEL, who followed in the Hongkong, and who was like " a man thoroughly " enjoying himself," passed through between the Coromandel and the bank. Then came the Haughty, with the boats of various large steamers in tow. The channel had been staked, and in a few minutes the Hongkong was a mark for tho firb of the junks, the range of which had been carefully calculated beforehUnd. While these things were going on in the left chanmel that which runs on the right bank of the .island was also attacked. The Oposumu 'dashed into the fire.

I was paying a .visit some -evenings ago at the house of a wealthy merchant, who feels -very uneasy at the present situation of affNirs. Among the -persons ambled to take t6a was a Russian officeri, with -whom I had a conversation, which left me under the im *presslon that if Russia was not preclsely asisigin the anovement she at least sees it with pleasure, and is pre-paring t take advantage of it. No. doubt thts is no -wew idea, but I believe the officer to whom I aUlcde dld not tell re aU he knew. I wished to iee him sgain yrsterday, and I caled at his house. I was -told that he had quitted Calcutta, and that he had tken the -road to Bissempoor. This circunstance confirmed -me in the opinion I had formed of Russia. Bisseampoor is -on the direct road to Delhi. Is it to Delhi that hM. Kotz ... -is going? I leave you a clear field for your suppositions." The following private telegraphic despatch has 'been received: - "MA.DRID, JUL.Y 31. "Extraordinary credits havs been granted for statisticl publications, for the provincial militia, and for the eni Sincer5. "The Spanish squadron has arrived at the Havaunah." The Governament journal Le Paijs expends mauch indignation at the unjust and illegal manner ia -which the elections are said to have been conducted {an Moldavia; and it addaces the " abstention" of .i great number of electors in. proof of the pressure -exercised by the Kaimakan Vogorides. The Pays is, Qf cmurse, shocked at such a state of things, and moralizes on this flagrant disregard of common justice. It says- " There are 3,283 ecclesiastics of all ranks in Moldavia; -of these 193 were incladed in the electoral lists, and 17 only bave voted. The Metropolitan of Jassy took no part in the operations. There are 3,000 large proprietors in the country, of whom 465 only were registered electors, and of whom only 207 voted. There are 20,000 smaU proprietors; the electors registered are only 2,264. The number of traders and artisans belonging to the class of persons mentioned in the Sultan's firman was 12,000, and the number de. scribed Ii the electoral lists was only 1,190. The electora borne on the lists of the class of the liberal profesdons are bet 11, and yet there are in Moldavia above 150 advocateswithout counting the persons belonging to the other pro. -fessions of the same kind. These facts (adds the Pays) suffice te characterize the last act of the Government of Prince Vogorides." The absence of so many persona who were -entitled to the franchise, and their non-participation in the elections, as well as the impediments offered by the Moldaviau Government to the exercise of their right, are-conzidered by-tbe Pays as fully jus-- tifying the French Government in demanding that these elections shall be quashed. This is rather a serious conclusiou to arrive at. T ihould be cu rious --to know the reply of the Emperor Napoleon if Prince Vogorides suggested to His Majesty that the late elections in France should be annulled on the ground of " abstentions" and of illegality. It was announced some days ago that the Montieur was about to publish a report in which the -olectioas were to be examined as to their moral inflaence on the country, but that report ha, not yet appeared. In the meantime I may say a few words on the " abstentions" and other grounds which would justify the Kaimakan ia requesting the French Government -to look at home before it denounces' the conduot of others. Is appears, from the returns published in the Mlenitev.r in July last, that there were 9,496,000 registered - electors in France; of these 6,137,000 voted 3,359,000 therefore abstained from taking any part in the elections. The Government has not shown that those who " abstained" would have voted for its own candidates, and if mere " abstention" be sufficient grounds for annulling the elections in Moldavia, it tells equally against those which have recently taken place in France. Of the 0,137,000 voters, 5,472,000 voted for the Government or the official candidates; 57 2,000 for -the Opposition, and 93,000 voting tickets were inadmissible on the scoreof irregularity. The MIoanite,r declared that "during the 20 days which by law -constitute the pse.od of electoral preparations, the most complete liberty would be left to the citizens to bring forward their candidates, and to the jouraals to publish their claims and to disctss them." Now, it is a well-ascertained fact, that from 1852 down to 1857 the Government Las on every occasion, -when it has judged it useful to its policy, impeded the distribution of the electoral tickets, even of candidates to the Councils General or -the municipal cotncils; that it has menaced with legal proceedings both the electors and the printers, and seized their tickets; that not very long ago it actually instituted such prosecutions; that the French tribunals declared, as those of Lyons did, that a bulletin or ticket with a name written or printed thereon was not, any more than a mere -visiting card, a production, or krit, the circalation -of wlich the authorities could prohibit " in the interest of public order or of public morals." The -Court of Cassation, it is true, ruled, in January last, that a votine ticket should be considered equivalent 'to a " profession of faith," and as such should be deposited in the Court of the Procureur Imperial* duly signed by the candidate, before it could be -distributed. The Judges, who had almost unanimously decided otherwise, and whlo will not be accused of systematic hostility to the Government, never dreamt of giving such an interpretation to a dlaw of!some yeamrs' tanding respecting the circula- -tion of " writings." The Court of Cassation which, to the surprise of all lawyers, gave such a decision, -is no doubt the highest in rank of the Tribunals; but its President is, at the same time, the complacent 'President of the Senate. The conduct of the autho- rities towards the distributors and printers of bulletins which, previous to the decision of the *Gourt of Cassation, could be no otherwise explained -than by the hostility of the Govermment to sthe candidates of the Opposition, had for efect that fn several towns where there was only one printer -of the Opposition he refused to print voting cards in 1857, in cohsequience of the proceedings taken .against him in 1852. The same apprehension nIaturajly preveuted persona from acting as distritutors of the bulletina in 1857. 'There exists auother mAterial difficulty in the way WfOppoAition cadites in the great majogy of 'electoral :dhrUot. 'There are more thin 57,00Q V9nluni4et izw h.ace and withlUt taking uiM Q the districts lto-v-rhich ,Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, and Bordeaux are respectively divided, an electoral district 'comprises from 140 to 150 rural com. munes. In all these cosm'unes the bulletins with the name of the Government'eandidate are Bent to the houses of the 'electors by the mayor or the , ~nieipal fn ctionarijs-at the same time that they send the 0ilectorld ticket. In the majority of thq arrondissemeunt where an Opposition candidate starts there are comujimes where not a single Opposition bulletin is to be seen. Moreover, the voting tskes place in the crmmunes; tht;t is, from 60 to 100 electors in the smaller communes, and a greater in the larger, speud two days in voting under the eye of the Mayor, a functionary whom t1he Government names or dismisses at pleasure, and wTho has been remindea, or warned, day after day that his duty is to make the people vote for the Governmei-st candidate. In the comparativ*ly small number of communes where the bulletins of thle Opposition have succeeded in making their way, it has often happened that the Mayor thtened to arrest the distributor, on the uround that he was endeavouring " to influence' the elections." In other communeq we havq seen that the placards of the Opposition candidates were torn from the waUi, with the additional notification that theMhyor recognized no other than the Governiment candidate as having fulfilled the legal formalities. It has also occured that the distributor of bulletins, who had come from auotfher town, has been paraded through the streets with a gendarme on each side of him, till such time a two electors could be founad courageous enorligh to commit themselves with "(iMonsieur le Xaire,P and to declare that they knew the OppositiWa'distributor, who had been treated as if he was a common malefactor. There was not a single district where an Opposition candidate appeared in which every possible impediment was not to beraised against him; and this was particularly the case in the rural districts. At the very gates of Bordeaux the posting of placards and the distributioni of baUlletins of the opposition candidate were forcibly prevented. It ceased, but only when the fact hadc been noticed by the journals. Another fact, which shows how difficult it was -to distribute opposition buUetins in the 150 communes of a rural district, occurred at Toulouse. We have the following on the authority of a Government paper caUed the AiheImeirial:- " Twenty-four individuals belonging to the lowest classes, half of whom were composed of street porters, bave been arrested in the Rue Castellane, at the residence of a person named Queval, where they were waiting for buUetins to distribute, and intended disturbirg the tranquillity of the elections. They were coaducted to the prison of St. Michel, and placed at the disposal of tbe Procareur ImperiaL" After such a razzia on the mere distributors of bulletins bearing the name of the hostile candidate, it is not surprising that the opposition should have been so trifling at Toulouse. Toulouse, like some other cities, was divided into several electoral districts with a view to prevent a combination between the inhabitants, and which is easier in a large town thau among the rural electors. Under such circumstances the elections of the cityof Paris, where five otat of eight districts (excluding Sceaux and St. Denis) return Opposition candidates, was a significant fact. Everywhere else the vexatious proceedings against the distributors of bulletins, from 1852 to 1857, the pressure exercised by the local authorities, the material difficulties in distribution of bulletius in the rural communes, the menaces or the absolate prohibitions against such distribution in a considerable number of communes, rendered a fair electoral contest hopelesi-a contest which, in fact, could have no chance of s4.ccess, but inasmuch as one-half at least of the electors had made up their minds to vote against the Government in. spite of all influences. The success of a majority of Opposition candidates throughout France, as in the city of Paris, would be slnpy af revolution. - The majority obtained by the Go,ernment may show that France has no desire for revoution; but it ought not to be understood as proving that France does not wish for more liberty than she now possesses. I silude to these facts, not for the idle purpose of repetition, but to show that the French Government is by no means entitled to lecture any one on the legality of elections. I may add, that it requires no small amount of hardihood to dictate to one of its organs such a Daragraph as this " We do not trouble ourselves with inquiring whether the pretended elections of moldavia have an unionist or an anti-unionist signification. The trath is, such elec tions have no significations, no value, no real existences and can have no offect. The greater part of the Moldavian electors have been deprived of the right of voting by thl authority of the Kaimakan Vogorides, and the small number of citizens who were permitted to vote have disdained to exercise a privilege which was repugnant to them on the present oocasion. In right, as in faot, we may say that there have been no eleotions in Moldavia." RUSSIA. The St Peten-burg Gazette publishes the text of a convention concluded at Berlin on the 14th of February last, and ratified on the 12th of March ult.i relative to the construction of a line of railway from Berlin to K6nigsberg in conjunction with the railway between St. Petersburg and Warsaw. The Russian Government engages to construct upon its territory a branch line from the St. Petersburg and Warsaw Railway, which will go by Kovno to the Prussian frontier near Eydkounen. On its side the Prussian Government engages to construct on its territory, inl continuation of the Russian line above-mentioned, a railway from the Russiaa frontier near Eydkounen as far as Konigsberg, where it will join the Bdrlin to KEnigsberg line. The Gazette of the Senate, of St. Petersburg, publishes the following regulations respecting the port of Odessa: - " On a report of the Minister of Finance, His Majesty the Btmperor, on the 4th of Juuelast,ord-ained as follows:- " 1. When the term expires of the privileges of the free port (pwosft fJarc) of Odessa, which expires on the 15th of August of the present year, that port wiU come under the actionk of the general tariff of the Customs of the Empire. 2. All foreign goods which at the above-mentioned date should still be in the port of Odessa without having paid the entrance dues at the rate of the tariff of the free port, will be called upon to pay at the faU rate of the general tariff, or will be admitted to re-exportation within the torm of one year. '¢3. The service of Custom-house surveillance already established on the limits of the free port will remain on the old footing till further orders. "4. As regards foreign goods delivered by the Odessa Customs without the Government stamp, and destined for the exclusive ue within the boundaries of the free port and which might still be ia circulation in the commerce of the town of Odessa, and which, according to the rales of the general tariff, will be sabject to the Customs' mark, the merchants of Odessa will be allowed time up to the 15th of August next to present a list of such goods to the chief Custom-house officer of Odessa with a view to have the stamp affixed. After that date all merchandise not dedared and found circulating in commerce without the Custom-house stmp, will be confiscated, according to the terms of the general regulations. "5. As the righat of entrep6t for an unlimited period ceases to exist at Odessa with the extinction of the freedom of the port, a right of entrep4t will be inatituted for the fixed period of one year on the same footing as in the ports of St. Petersburg, Riga, ana Archangel. " 6. On and after the 15th of August the payment of onefifth ef the produce of the entrance dues paid by foreign merchandise at Odessa, for the benefit of the revenues of that town, will also oease."

ATTBMPTED FRAUD. READIN~G, SATuRDAY. A young mian, of very fashionable appearance and swarthy complexion, with a fine mopetacbe, -who pave his nrnle as John Siiieton Coley il, and described himself as an accountant of the city of London, was yesterday aftern noon examined before Mr. Walford, Mr. Morris, Mnr. Darter, and Captain Prvia magistrates for this borough, on the charge of having of the 16th of June lnst falsely pretenided to Rdwa d Bole, grocer, Daoke-strae~ etading, that a meeting of th creditors had been held on the prcviols Monday, at which maeeting notices in bankruptcy hd beeo ti caled by Me "rsi:Cotiway and Co., a nd Vhk and IN.,. wh lslegocr of Londoh, ad creditors of hift;as -tIehs (Ple's)ereandit was entirely gone inLodoer, andt#sidt th mof 5m, With detent to The caeectd not t binten h, Interest among the tradomen of theatow, apsnd hed nagietrates were compeHled to adjourn tNe. sitting fJrym the police.coutrt to the Coancil Mr. Serjeant Parry attended speciaRy in oupporitf the chrte ; Mr. Sadler wstched tho case for the defendilt. Froma the opening statement of the learned SEoRnAprT, i appearod that on the 16th of June last the defendant caled upon 1thr. Pole and stated himself as coming from an association cled the "British Mercantile Agency." Whether therewas such an association or no the learied aserseoit said he could not inform the bench, hLt he had reason to believe that a person named George Carter, iving in chambers at No. 11- Old ewry, with an office on the third floor, was in reality the association. Many persons of eminence inthe city of London ad nubsribed.to the "British Mercantile Agen6y," the professed objects of which were to collect debts, to enforce warrants of attorney on persons -who were in faiing circumstances, to seek to wind up their affalrs a-ad secure, if possible, a yment of a dividendl of 10s., 12s. 6d., or 15s. in the pound to those conheted with mercantile firms. Only Carter and the defendant Hill hAd been seen in oonnexion 'with the association or Agency, to wfhich Messrs. Richardson and Hill weeo the selicitors, aim the lattes undertook, for the annual subscription fee of 20 guineas paid to the agency, to put . the creditors to no furtHs r expense, aor arrangemexnt which he (Mr. Sereant 'Parry) most strongly condedmed as opening the, doorto extortion and injusbtic The lear ed sereian't then, having detailed the nature of the case against the defendants proceeded to examine Mr. P61et,einho stated that on the 16th of June the drifendant rcaed upon him, as coning from MoemSr. Hanson and Co. for A debt of 45f. 12g. 3d. While he was writing a check for the amount the defendant tiusntacopy ofa writ into his baeom, and ad he did so in order to laim their exaenses. Witness gave him te checki when the defendant saad he had another Account of flnd, to collect for HickS, Baylis, and Co., forwhichwitnessofferto give alnother chek; but prisoner decfined to receive it, sayighehad a notice in bankraptey to serve on him from Mesr. Conway And Co., and Baylis and Co. At that timre his oredit with Messrs. Copway was unexpired, so he did not owe them anything. Defendant added that there had been a neeting of witness's creditors at his (defendant's) office the psevious day, and they were determined to wind witns up without giving him time to pacook' his accounts. Witness declned to go inito the matter further with him then, bit made an ao. pontmerndt to .,set him that same afternoon at his solicitor's, when defendant, after further conversation, said, if Mr. Pole would eve defendant and his partner 50. and pay 12a. or 5sa. in the pound for the creditors, thay would easily settle matters, When defendant asked witneos to give him 501., and said he would carry witness through for 1Ps. od. in the pound, he added, Our clients are hound to take whatever we offer them." The cress-examination of this witness elicited nothing ma. tehio ufavourothe aprisoner,b bto nthe ontrary. Mr. J. Neale, plaintiff's solicitor, in whose presence the meeting by appointment took place, having corroborated .uch of the revdence of Mr. Pole, Mr. Conway, tie head of the firm of Codnway and Co., was called, and spoke in the strongest terms Rs to the perfect solvency of the plaintiff, and dened Mrost distinctly thaB he had ever attended any raeetng of M1r. PoWs' creditors, signe,d Any notioo in banukruptcy, or ever athorized Carter anid Co. to call on Mr. Pole. MT. SADLEPs addrted the Court for the defence, and contended that no false pretence bad been used on the part of the defendant, though he did not deny that nob eetinth of Mr. Pole's creditors had ever taken place, as Hil had alleged ; still he submitted that the eviuenoe had not dis . closed any fraudulent intention. Cbe court having been cleared for the purpoe of the imegiarates eneuIlIng together, It was opened in a few minzutes, and the clerk then read the charge to the defendant, who pleaded "1Not Guilty."1 The usituaY caution wa4 given to the defendant, but he decleed to make any statement. Mr. WA&s,oRD said, the magistrAtes hAd mnade up their minds to commit the defendant for trial at the nextasessions. Mr. Serjeant PARRY said, as far as his elionts were concornedl be did not object to hail being granted.. TIto Matrates stated that they would admit defendant to b0l, himself in 2001., and two sureties of 1001. each. As the defendant could not get the bail by the time the Court broke up he was conveyed to the sounty gaol.

As the -currency in- question is worth 15 per cent. less than that of the United States, the amount to be actually paid on account of the loan wiU be something like $600,000. An accident, which might have been attended with fearful results, had taken place at the Hoboken Fer , on the New Jersey side, by the giving way of o e'of the bridges. Although 50 persons were immersed, all were rescued without material injury. A policeman in New York had been shot dead by a burglar named Michael Canceni1 an Italian, whom he was endeavouring to secure after committing a burglary. The occurrence created intense excitenment, as the officer was highly esteemed. The butchers of the district determined to " lynch" the assassin; to this end they erected a gaUows. The police had the greatest difficulty in protecting their prisoner. A brig had been seized by the United States' iasBhal for taking to New York a native Erooman from the coast of Africa. The native is said to be a British subject ; and the object in taking him to the United States was the teaching of him and others enough of the English language to enable them to act as Interpreters for the slaves, for which purpose large prices are paid by the blave traders. ab iDamore Tne Whiskey and alcohol distillery of Mesrs.

The 4teamsbip Black Warrior had arrived at New York with dates from Havannah to the 16th ult. The British ship-of-the-line Orion, Captain Erskine, had arrived at Havannah on the 14th from the Isthmus, aud was to sail in a few days for Halifax; all well on board. There was no change in the sugar-market. The stock at Havannah was 24,000 boxes, and at Matanzas, 75,000. The city was free from fever. Exchange had improved.

H6 will atted he Etmperor on his visit to Osborne. The Emperor bas declared ihat Michel Ney, Duke of Elchingen, a Second Lieutensnt ia the Chasseurs daAfrlq0e, shall asurae thle title of Prinoe de la Noe ow. Letters from the East again allude to the dieaaAi that has arisen among the members of the Greek Church in consequence of the foolish conduct of the Vicar-Apostolic and the FrenchConsul about imposing the Gregorian calendar. Bather than submit to this wanton innovation, many of the Greek Catholics have preferred becoming schismatice. At Beyrout, it Tould appear, the Bishop, I ritest and population of the dio have reuw eto recoze the Pope any loager as head of the Catholio Church, as the Court of Rome has not vouehsafed to take any notice of the remonstrance addremed to it against the forcible introdtuc. tio of a nomenclature which is so contrary to their usages and traitions. The asbityT lsut. ting up of the church in Alexandria, the order for which was obtained, or rather extorted, from the Pasha, drove, as I have already mentioned, 1l0 of the first families of the p1ace, as well as several in the neighbourhood of Sidon, to joln, the '; Schismatic" faith, as the.y were left without a place of worship; and not les than 50 other families 'were on the point of following them. On the 6th int. eiht Bishops admriniteTng dioceea were about to meet in ynod iln the Convent of St. George. This was agreed upon in compliance with t$o excpress -wish of the population as a precautona niegsu~e against the ruin 'which they b9eve thrst~ens thie "snation" It 'was also decided to appoint a icar.in place of the Patriarch. From CrohI lear that at lest three-fourtis of the popu. 1ation of that ty anaditn4bgbourhoodhave addreF a petition to the Biohops and also to the Pat notifyig that they would resst to the last and at all risk the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. The French Consul at Cairo made a complaint to the Governor against one of the leading merchants of the place, named Effendi Mohallo, az the principl causwe of the refusa of the people and the mesaineus which followed the attempt to abolih' the calendar. Effendi Mohalla was summoned, before the Governor. He denied that he had excited the indignation of the people, though he participated in it, and that he sa wel as they 'wre determined to abide by their old cuatoms. Tke Governor dismised hlm in peace. It was still hoped that the French Government would give Intructioun to its Consula and other agents to refrain from meddling in Greek hagiologies or calendars, and to allow the inhabitants to retain their festivalsas they think proper, and, Above all, that peremptory orders would be given to the Consul at Alexandria to allow the church which he had caused to be shut up to be again opened, and to have the priest whom he caued to be exiled restoed to liberty and to the unrestricted exercise of his religious duties. The affair is likely to lead to fture trouble, if it be not settled in time. Another body of pigrims are to sail from Mfar-aeilles for the .oly Land on the 20th of August.

Henry Evans, who was a re ainder-man under tl.e limits. tiona of the will, raising thoes quesions, and contending that what had been done 'was according to the tesator's intention, and that tho surplus was capital and not lneome; wheres the respondents contended that the tesator in. tended the mans2on-bouse to be built vithin 1 yeas from his death, and that the nrAws as Income, an that the lengthened period during which the aocumulations had taken place was clearly within'the restriction 'epon perpetultle&.

The V1cs Cs33EAML was of opinion that the 10years limited by th testator applid to the poriod over whic the deduc-don froi tho income should extend, and not to the time to be consumed in building the house, and the truzt fox accumlations applied aS muoh to the last thousand as to any of the former thousands, It ws well known that in building a mansion like this It was hmpo3 sible to prdicate what time it would take. It moreover apeare uonwhat had tal-eu place In these st that tha bilding of the mazio-botse was opposed by a great many persors intereted, and it bad been awsumed that what had been done ws right. and hia Honour's opnion was that it was cording to the intention of the tesator. The Court had decided that the TheIlusson Act had nothing to do with the queetion, and on the grounds above referred to the surpTlus must be oonsidered as capital, and not income. (Before.

On the conltrary, the law of this country was Irrespective of the per sonslatetus, and prevented him from being entitled to inIherit such real estate. The case of " Doe v. Vardy" (9, Bligb, N.

RuseRl conduoted the- proe cution; Mr. G. ]erannin was coouel for the prisoner. The circumsaices of this ease were of a mOtt dreadful charaoter, btut the fact lay in a very narrow compas, and hie cr -a clearly established against the prieorer by the evidence for the prosecation. It appeared tamt the parents of the prisoner lived in a smiall house in. a seet called Bedford-ow at Imaldstone, and that theprisoner, the deoesed (who waz 24 year old), and a younger brother sied Samuel, All lired together. The deoased apepred to havobeenahardl-workingweoU conducted young man,who by his exertions aided to support the family in respectbility, but the prisoner Appeared to have been an idle, goodforilothing fellow who would not work, but subWited in Idle. neo upon his father's and brother' exertions. Oa Mon. daY, the 16th of March, the father of the prisoner told him that he had got some work for him at the establish. roent where be was himself employed, and the prisoer made nome evasive answer to the effect that he had got work at anotherplace Thedeoeased, onhearing this, told the pri ione th at it he did not go to work whea it was obtained for him he would turn him on, of doors, and the prisoner ap. peaed very angry at what hs brother said, and there was ry little doubt that he was actated by a feeling of revenge Inthe cime that hes ubsequently committed The dreadful occurrnce took PlaOe on the night of the 18th Of March. It seemed that the deceased young mra came home from his work about hAlf-past 8 o7clock, and at onoe proceeded to the bedroom that was oocupked by the prisoner andhimself, which was the back room on the fi-t fior. Abouat half-put 9 the father and the e5ber brother, Satuel, went to their bedroom, which was in the front of the houe, and the mother of theprisoner at up for him, =ad %bout a quager to l0 be came home. she then went up to her bedroom and as he pased the room of the desed she saw him in bed, and apparently aeep. The rzisonsr remained dowaira, bt shorUy afterwards he was heard by Ms mother to go into the bedroom wher the deceased was, and the mother then went downstair%, on account, as it ppeared, Of the prisoner being in the WA of going out late at night, to see If the houee was fastened, [and she found that the front door was locked, and that the beok door was Also properly secured. No thingmore occurzed untl about half-past 12 oclock at night when the mother was awoke by hearing a noise as of sme person mnoaning in her sonse bedroom, and she imme. dixtely strck a light And proceeded therc, when an awful ig4ht presented itself. The uafostunate deceAsed wsu lying On the bed with s-eral dreadful gashes upon lis head, and the pillows and bedding were completely satuated with blood. The prisoner was gone, and he had evdently got away from the house by jumping out of the window, which as found open, and two garden pots that had been upon the window sil were knookod down by him in hi3 flight. Upon the room being seahed thea was found under the bed an ase covered with blood 1 end hlis. It -was a most fearful weapon, the edge ol the blUde being nine or ten inohes long and weighing at least llb., and it sufficiently accounted for the dreadful injulres that were discovered upon the head of the decesed. Mr. Saunders, a surgeon living at Laidstone, was promptly in attendance, but although the unbappy young man Ws alive he was perfectly unoc scious, and nothing oould be done to allevite his saufferings, and at 8 o'clock the same morning he expired. A more careful examination of the injuries he hAd received was then made; and it Was aew. taked that the hoUl and scalp had been fractured most dreadfully in two ples and that the membrane of the brain had been severed, and the jawbone was also broken. There I w-s no doubt that al these frightful Injuries had boen occa. sioned hy the ame that was produced, and the surgoon expressed an opinion, from the character and direction of the wounds, that they had been inflicted while the unhaiu y deceased ws in a reclining position, and most proba'ly while he was asleep. Ee also Asted that the first blouw must have beea mortal, and that it produced immediate unconsciouniow Nothing 'u Meen of the prisoner until 9 oelouk the same morning, when he made his ap. pea*anceat the house of an uncle at Brompton, near Rcochester, and he breakfssted with him, and In answer tothequestionof wrhatroughthimtoBrompton, he sid that he had come from Maidstone on the previoua night 'with a young woman, and that he had stayed late rith her, and so ne thought he would take s stroll and see his uncle. He then sid that he wa very tired, and laid down, and slept till 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when he had Some tea, and in the course of the conversation he had with his unole on this day he said that his father was at work, and also that Ms brother Thomas had got work, but that he himself had not Aone anything dnce the hop seaon. The prisoner went Away from -Irs unel oush-oit 9 atelock on-tle 8 ght of &he l9th of March, stating that he was going to Maidatone, but on the following mornint he was met by one of the Rochester police in the High-street, Rochester, and he, having received information of the murder and the description of the prisoner, took him into custody. Mr. DxIwA?, who had put some questions to the father and mother of the prisoner with a view to show that he had exhibited strangeness of conduct upon some occasione, made a very able address to the juy on his behalf, and endeavoured to show thathe was not in a sound state of mind at the time he oommitted the dreadful erlme. The learned JUDcR summed up, and The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Hii LosDSHIp then put on the black cap, and, after makng a few observations upon the dreadful character of his crime, sentenced him to be executed, at the same time telling him that his doom was certan, and advising bim to makeuse of the short Space that remained to him In this vorld in endoavouring to obtain pardon from the Almighty for his awful crime. The prisoner, who betrayed no emotiou during the trial or wrhen the sentence was delivered, then walked wayfrom the bsr with a firm step. A.'oour 1. The business of these asslze was brought to a conclusion last night the calendar having been heavier than it has been in this county fora gret number of years. George Campbell, d8, engie fitter, wasbrought up for sentence just before the adjournment of the Criminal Court. It will be remembered that this prlsoner, while an Iamate of Maidstone Gaol, stabbed a fellow prisoner Iwith a chisel and, although it appeared that the st was comnmitted under circumstanoes whLch clearly showed that the pnsoner was insane, that the medical officers of the prison at once certified to that effect, and that he was removed to the county lunatic asylum, where he remaained upwards of 12 months before he was considered in a fit state to be removed, Mr. Jumstice Willes, who tried him, ruled that, inasmuch as the surgeon was unable to state that at the time the offence was committed the prisoner was not aware thst he wVS strking ablor, and that it was an unlawful act, the jury would not be jastified in acquitting the prisoner on the ground of insanity, and that the only question they could legally consider was whether the intent of the prisongr was only to do grievous bodily harm. The jury, upon this' ruling, evidently, however, with great reluctance, found the prisoner a a of the minor charge, but juadgment was respited. Mr Juseice Wsnnxs nowv sentenced the prisoner to be kept in penal seritude for four years, at the same time informing him that the condition of his mind would be in quired into and that the Secretary of State might interfere in the matter if he thought proper to do so. The commission for the county of Sarrey will be opened on Monday at Croydon.

The prisoner had lodged In the proseoxtor's house during the previous May, and knew the honse well and where the money was kept.

It appeared that the prisoner was a yonng woman, who for several years had maintained a respectable character, and Obtaille her living as a demeetlo servant. For some moad previon s to Februy IA sbe been living in the ereice of a Mr. Hooding, a tradeaman at Ledbury. In the early part of Febuary sonme reports being afloat that the was in the faaily-way, the prisoners mother took her to Mr. Griffn, a tueon at lxdbnay, and he gpve it as bis opinion that she was in the family-way, though the prisoner herself denied it. Mr. Hooding, her mnaster, on the 5th of February, discharged her from his servioe upon that ground, A she then went to reside with her m2other in the nieighoarhood, at a place called Boebury. Towards the end ofthe month sbe wsa delivered of a healthy male child, 'which was nursed and taken cae of till the 12th of March, when it was lat seen alive, On the maornIn& of that day the prisoner called upon a neighbouar a Mrs. Pi'tchard, -without herbonnet, and said she was going t-o takeher childtoledhbury. Thesameafternoon, atbetween 3 and 4 o'clock, she again caled 'with er bonnet on, and told Mirs. Pritchard, in answer to inquiries, that she had taken the child to ledbury. A man named Roberts, who was working on the highway, said he sawthe prisoner about 200 lards from her own house crrina ba by in her arms along theroad whichledby the toedbury, and tbat between 3 and 4 in the afternoon of the same day he saw her return along the sameoroad withoutthe bab. About the same day of the umonth, at between 12 and 1 oaclock, the prisner went to her former raster at Ledbury, Mr. Hooding, and received her wes, and between 2 and 3 o'clock the xame afternoon Mfr. lIooding saw her in the street going towards Bosbury. On the 18th of March the prisoner told Mr. Griffin, the surgeon, that she had placed te child with 3rs. Ring, in Soultend-stret, ledbury; but t.Ld was proved to be untrue. Nothing was seen of the"prisoner's child after the 2h of March- bhut aan early honr on the 1st of April a mason living at fedbury, named Jates. Lane, was near a bridge called B3rtn.bridge, over the L~edbury and Hereford Canand about 100 yards from the bridge, a td two miles frini isbury, he saw something floating on the water, and having St it out, he found it to be the body of A male infant, dressedin infant's clothes. John Fleetwood, the pazish constable, took the body to Ledbury, where it was examined by Mr. Griffin and another surgeon, namned Lewis ; and the same day he went to the prisoner's house at Bo4aury, and told her she had got into a scape, sad that a childI' body had been found in the canal, ad it ' speted tlobe her,. Tho prisoner said there was a bother ahout ti 2i child wvhen it was taken aa and now there wa a bother aboutit sgpin The constable thbe took her into at:ost -o Mlr,Baron nAnswxx ewutlfed yilGii re';er agAin to tell a prisoner she bad got into a scrape. It was no 1,0 of a policeman's duty to lead prisoners into trape and ternfy them into making statements. Mary Jones, an oldwoomwa, aged 7g said she lied In the same house with the prisoner at Bosbury, and r was there 'when the child was born. She had dressed the-oiS eve morning till the 12th of March, and on that d y the p. scer said she 'a going to put it to Purse, but she did not say where. When she returned home in the evening the prisoner said they took it, and that the people who had got it did not wish her to come to see it till itgot settled. In order to show that the child found inthe canal was the prisoner's, it was shown that the prisoner was seen going with the child in the direction of the canal, and returning without it. The medicl 'witneses were also examined, and they stated that on the forehead of the child found In the canal there was aL naevus (a small vascular mark) about the size of a pea, and the nurse stated that when the child was born there was a small mruk (a little red speck) on its forehead, but she beloved It had gone off two or three dals before the child was taken away. MIrs. Pritchard ave similar evidence. The nurse could not identify the clothesa foand upon the child, but said they were of aninferior qality to those which the prisonE's child hwAdworn. She ao said she thought the child found was larger than the prisoner's. The medical witnesses gave it as their opinion that the child found had died of suffocation from drowning. The nurse and mr Pritchaad stated that the prisoner had been a kind mother to her child, kept it nice and clean, and appeared to be very fond of it; they also added that the prsoner was a very industrious youn,g woman, but subject to fits, in one of 'which Mrs. Lane, the~ nurse, said she ha let the ifant fall out of her lap, and. there was dager of both mother and infant being burnt. Mrs. Pritchard and Mr. Hooding, her late master, also spoke to the fact of her having fits, and the latter said she had bad several while in his servicc. It appeared that when the prisoner ws taken before the coroner at the inquest she was discharged for went of suffirAent evidence; but subsequently she was taken before the magistrates and committed. After she had been conmmitted she vwas allowed to remain for some time at the Ledbury station in the custody of Shed, the police supezintendent; and while there, according to the evidence given by the superintendent's wife, Catharine Shed, and a man named Burton, the prisoner rmade a confesdon of her guilt. On coming out of the magistrates' room, the witness, Cathazine Shed, said to the prisoner, " Harriett, what is theimatterwith -you, wat are you crjing for P" The prisoner' answered that she was " committed to EHereford ;" and then, in conversmion on the subject of the evidence, added, "The woman could not identify the child, because it hd not had the clothes on before. It was my baby. I threw it into the water, and if I could have got it out again I would." It appeared on the crossexamination of this 'witness that at the last winter assizes she had been examined as a 'witness in a eace of child murder tried before Mr. Baron Watson, and proved a confession. On being asked whether she had nothbeen reprimanded by the judge for the manner in which she bad obtained the confession, she at first denied. it ; theon she said she was not aware of it; and finaly admitted that it might have happened. it appeard that the witness had kept te prisoner's alleged confession a secret until she came to Hereford, and had not told even her own husband what she could prove. A man named Burton, grdener, waho did jobo for Superintendent Shed, was also cled, and stated that on the 6th of April he 'was passing alon the passage by the cell in which the prisoner was at the, dbury station, and that she caRled to iim and said, The only,,ccrson who swore fale against me is old Boberts. Hc sworctniat hc saw the child's face. That was not likely, for I had it wrapped up in my mother's shawl. I carried it to the canal side and threw it in. I was sorry after I had done it, and would have puiledit out, but Iceuldnot. I wenthome and took up my little sister and nursed it half an hour. It was as nice a child as you ever saw. It was as large whennewly-born as some are when amonth old. The mark on its forehead was the mark of a Ipiece of beef." Burton said he replied, " It is a pity you did it, and all you can do is to pray the Lord to forgive you." Oncross-exanination, this witness did not give a very satisfactory account of what he was doing nearthe prisoner's celL When he went home that night he made a memorandum of -what he had heard the prisoner say (which he pro. duced. in court), but it appeared be had not given any information of what he could prove till a few days ago, though he said he might have mentioned it slightly in publichouses. SuperintendentShed was also putin the box, and was asked, in cross-examination, 'whether, at the last winter assizes, he and his wife had not both been reprimanded by Mr. BaronWatsoni, he for asking questions of a prisoner, and his wife foa the mode in which she had got a conf,esion from her. He at first ald he had not, then that he was not aware of it, and at length he would not swear that what was suggested did not happn. It appeared that before the inqust the conduct of the prosecution was in the hands of the arish constable Pleetwood, but after the inquest Superintendent Shed had the conduct of it. Mr. PowinL,, for the defence, contended, first, that the identity of the body found in the canal with that of the prisonrs child was not proved, as it ought to be, before a jury could convict. In the next place, it was not shown to have been thrown into the c nal when aiive; and, thirdly, it might have falen in while the prisoner was going along the towing paith on her way to Iedbury, and taen i one of the fitsto which she was liable. The learned counsel made somec revere comameLuts on the evidence given by tha SU,erlntend7eiat and irs. Shed, aed the mant Burton, t an tha the ba o ced with anvie to public justice, but erg upon the several questions in ise. is Lordship observed that thxe evidence as to the identity was not conclusive.

XORFOIX CIRPTnr. NORWICH. JuLy 30. --VwV wURT.-tjeJore M?. J1Ltle WsUae.) James Ablett, aged 50, wa indicted forthe wilful murder of Angus Stuart at Yamouth, on the 22d inst. IMr. Cherry was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. W. Cooper, at the request of the leaned judge, defended the prlsoner. T'he deceased ws an ged paralytio pauper In the Yar. mouth 'workhoue, where the prisoner, 'who wa awo a pauper, fied the office of wader or nuse. The enfeebled condition of the deceased wa productive of great trouble to hs attendant, his bed and linen being frequently fouled, so much o that he appeaed to offend desinedly. Oa the morning of t'he 22a the other inmates of the sic'k ward were aroused by the loud lmprecaionx of the prlsoner, who was seen to admlnister-pesDnal clm. tisememt to the bare person of the unfortunate criple with a handbros. fterthis he took him out of his bed and set bim on his feet when he knocked his head about from side tol side with his clinched s4, aying he would " gullet" him. The deceased begged to be let alone, and the terrifiedapaupers, who stood gret awe of the pri. Boner, Interceded for mercy. The deceAed w then fi onto the nightchlsr, where his head Lmmeditely fell onhJii cheot and he never spoke more. Tbe Attention of the pri. seonr being called to the ecased, he Ufted up li1a ead, And, observing that his lip was cat and bleeding, lie called for 'water, washed hbm and put lin to bed where lie lay in an insenslble state till death released hln at 9 o'clock. The medical witesEx agreed in attributing the death of the deceased to the blows ivflicted by the pnsoner. Mr. CooPRa having addresed the jry, contendin that at the worst his client oould not be convicted of a hiher offence than that of manaugher Mr. Justice WDuAms aummea up the evidence, pointing out the datinctionbetwen marder and manslaughter, and leaving it to them to ay whether, under all the Ccai3n stance of the case, the ptrioner'e cdrne was one which might be reduced below that of murder. Thejury found the prisoner Guity of mnanlaughter. Sentence, 15 yeas penal servitude. (Before a City Jurv.) Sladrach 3Lann, aged 19, Frederick WZarren, aged 15, W-. llam Davison, the younger, aged 30, Williha Davison, aged 62, and Joseph Davison, aged 24, were indited for tealing and receiving 3601b. of sugar and one bag, the property of George Wilson. Mr. Bulwer prosecuted. The three first-nared prisoners pleaded " Guilty. Mr. Desnt defendea the two other prisoners. Mr. Wilson is a large confectioner in this city, and for some time past has missed gratquantities of mugar and other artioles without being able to detect the offender In June lst. he received an anonymous letter which indced him to examine the dustbin and oesspool of a privy in his back yard, to which aces was obtained from the street by along passage. ln the latter of these places his foreroan found on a Sunday night eight loaves of lump sugar and a bag containin 1601b. of moist sugar. Awatch was accordingly set5 and at 6 o'clock on the following morning the three avisons, who are city scavengers, made their ap}aance in the yad. JoeephDa'sison cam airnt, looked about, and retired. Presntly his father and brother Wiiamn came, and while the father 'was emptying the dus the son went to the privy puled up the trpdoor which communicated with the cese. pool, ana caUed to his father, after which they were both seen to lift the bag of mr ot of the eesspool, and place i m a hamper, and carry it down the paage to the other Davison, who set to work toheap dust over tke bag. The Devisons were thereupon immediately taUken Into custody, and from a sttement made by Willisam Davion tbeyoumger who was the head contractor, it appeared that the sugr had been placed in the yard by the two prisoners Ranm and Warren, who 'wre in the servioo of Mr. Wilson, in pursuance of. an arrangement that they should have 15. for so doing. The boys at once admitted the trth of this story, andaetailed the manner in which they had carried out ther purt othe scheme. Tie ab having been clesrly bbrongbt beane t the two prisonez. who pleaded " Not Guilty," they were emvc, a athe wAe Hims PIUSOulRT.-{Befom LordCAmPULL4n4 aspcc Jury.) PAMn V. TLXXvL Mr. Serjeant Wells, Mr. Palner, Mr. Couch, and iii. Naylor were counsel for the plaintiff; Mxr. Keane and Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the defendant. The plantL is a solicltor of propezy, who bas carried on business for 37 years at Upwl, In tls county, and this wss a action for slander agaibst the defendat, who is a farmer, "livingupright and independent," as one of the witnesses said, i the neighbouring town of Outwell The declaration oontained four counts The first and second in effect charged that the defendant had said of the plaintiff, on the 26fih and 29th of Muy, 1856, " he hbs robbed me of old T9cla s ro~erty." The third count charged that the de. fendant h&a said, on a subsequent day, when he wa se ved with a writ at the suit of the plaintig " Charles Weal said in Wisbeach, 'Old Palmer will be broken up and done in less than sx months.' I would not trust him with 5s.; he would do anything toget money." Thofourth cout charged the defendant with havi7 wid, " Thalmer has got 2001. that Mr Trot paid him, As tbe attorney of Sr. Shepherd. He vill never prove the will, as he mean to keep the money." The defendant pleaded "Not Gilt" and a justification. As to the firstand second he pleadedin effect that Mr. Tuck, having made his will in favour of Mrs. Reeve, feU into A stBte of imbecility, and that the plaintif 'whilebe was thus incompetent, induoed him to make another will, by -which his propertwas diverted Into other channels, to the exclusion. of Laeeve. The justifcation to the third count set f orth that in 1852 an act-ion ha been brought by the plaintiff against one Tumer to recover 204 on a promissory note, and that on the tril of that action the subshantial issue was whether the plaintiff had forged the note on which he sued by altering the word "eve Into "1twenty," and that the plaintiff had4 then tsworn falsely that he had not done so, but that the jury had found a ver. dict against him - and so the defendant Alleged thait the statemeLnt that ihe plaintf 'would do anything to get money " was true in substance snd in fact." To the fourth count there was a general plea of truth, by way of justif0ation. The trial of this cause, which seemed to excite consider. able interest, lasted 13 hours yesterday, there being evidence offered on both sides which branched out Into minute details touching transactions between the plaintiff and some of bis clients, extending over a period of several years. Into these partieulars it would be impomsible to enter. It must sffioe, therciore, to say that, as regards the issues involved In the twofirst counts, Mr. Tuck was shown by very clesr evi. deuce to have made the will complained of b the defendant at a time when he was quite competent, though he had had a fit a few months before, and that the change in the disposition of his property was hbis own spontaneous Act. The defendant, however, imbibed a different imprs. slon, and under the influence of that feelng, and knowing that Mr. Tuck had had a fit, disputed the wil in the Prerogative Court of Norwicb but without effect. In cose- cueuce of the conduct of the defendant in connexlon with that Will the plaintiff determined to take proceeing against him to recover 1001.'which he bad lent to him on t e security of a note signed by him and the late Mr. Tuck, and It was on the oocaion of the service of the writ t-hat the defe)d?nt sqkatie word,l-which formea the subject o etimrosand, met important count of the declaration. When the issue was first made up there was no plea of justification to this coun and the cause stood for trial before Lord Campbell at theast sum mer assi2es. The defendant, however, applied to add this justification, and obtained leave on payment of the costs of the day, coupltd with the postponement of the triaL Under these circumstances it was that the canse now came on for trial and with referenee to the third count and the plea of justiEcation, the folowing state of facts appeared in evl. deuce on the part of the plaintiff :-In 1847 Mr. Palmer had for a client an old man named Henry Turner, who had a son and a grandson bearing the same Cbristian name. In the December of that year the grandfather and father bor. rowed 201. from the plalntimf vwho Advanced that sum, partly by a check for 71, And the rest in cash, taking as a secuity a joint and several promissory note for 204. Before that transaction there had bena nother admce of 71., when a smailar note for that account had been taken. at account had been settled by the grandson, but the note being mislaid had not been given up. The note for 20. rermned in the plaintiffs hands till after the death of the gradfathcr, when the plaintiff brought an action against the grandson as executor, to recover the amount, as well as a bill of costs, to which he pleaded that the grandfather did not make the note, and never indebted. The solicitor for the defence was Mr. ODlard, who,. having been articled to Mr. Palmer, had afterwards become his partner, though a dissolution subsequently took place. Before that cause came on for trial the psamntiff was takeni before magistrates on a charge preterede by Mr. Olard at the suit of his clients! of forging the 201h note by altering the word "' seven" Into "twrenty," 1tbeing alleged thattherehadneverbeenmore than one advance or note, and that -when 71. had been lent, which hadbeen paid off£Twonotes, however, for 201. and 7., bearing different datec were produoed, and the charge was dismissed, after which criminal proceedings for perjury were directed atainat both the Turners and an WAio of mallcious prosecutifntwas commenced by Xr.

TEE MAIN DRAINAGB OF LONDON. The followlng me the " Conacuione" at whiclh the gentlemnen to whom was referred the consideration of the plans proposed by thBe letropolitn Board of Works have areived - "ON'UszomS. "e.. Tha W the Sfuence of the sewag on the river Is rernicous. ,deiepatyrothppl.I " 2. That this sewage r deved puUy fro,t Usupo, tloL of the metropolitda ihict, ata pary from ihe popwlation of other districts, occupying the same pat of the main aley of the Thamneg or of valleys subddiary tot main vaey; and that the quantity o sewage for themetro, Politan district alone, which flows daily into the ThUesat the present time, isl5,249,777 cubicfeet. " 3. That in order to parify the tdal portion ofthe Thames from sewage It will be neessay to exclude from it not only the eage of the metropolitan disct, but the sewage from thee other adjacent districtS. II 4 Tba the planof the Xetropoiitn Bowd of Works doer not provide for the removal of a suicient quntity or sewage from the metropolitan disticts; that the amount of rainfall vhich It th tontemaplaeby tMIs 7phr. to Intercept from the river should be nereasd ; and, that the pUn doer Lot make adequate provison for removing from districts adjacent to the metropolis the sewage whick flow, into the river within the limits of the metropolnte district, "d.sTt frthe prospective population of the metropolitan dieaiot, for which provion should be made, Is 3,578,08S, s cpared with 2,362,236 In 1851; the popuation of the suuddiw disric beIng 401,00D as oom"d with lI068 in 1851; the total proqpeive popultion bdeng 3,979,OS9. That the onDy mode of estimating approxMAely the probable mnoumt of sewae from the district is to a mo a Certain quntity per hea of tne population. ThAt seven cublec feet per heAd ie the amount for which provision should bOmsda; thst itappearfrosiorexperiment t h&tf this quantity pasees off in eight hours; and that no sewage should be permitted to flow Into the Thames in or Aw the metropolis until it shall are been diluted with live addi. tional volumes of rain water in the suburban distric4 and that In the eght hours of the maximum flow of the sewe provision should e mzade tor removing two-fifths inches of ranfall in the urban distcts. " 6. That the large popMltien of the portion of the main valle of the Thames, occupied by the metropolitn distic, bU so diverted the natural sprin, and ro saturated the ground rith ewae, that with the exoeption of the water from the Widlet the Baveley Brook, the Ravenabourne, and the lea, It is impracticable to preserve, to any uneful extent, pre water from these streams to flow into the Thames. "IL. " L That no sYstem of drainge i adapted for the metropolis Which does not relieve the low level districts from floods, and that the ystem wbich is adopted must therefore provide for interceqtlng the uplnddrabiage; and that, with a view to economy and to freedom from risk of floodse the ar from which the sewage should be removed by nsaural means should be ag large as poss£ble, and the area fromo which the sewage should be removed by atiffcial mens should be as sma as possible. " 2. That the sewage, when eollected, nast be removed with as little prtical inconvenience or injury a posible, eitber to the inhabitants of the metropolis or to the mba' bltants of the districts to which it is conveyed. " 3. That the so-called deodorizAtlon of sewage does net remove the highly putrescible soluble consEtients from the lquid wbich passes off; and tt, crnequently, the liquid, after deodorizetion, mast be dipoed of in the samemanner as ordinary sewage wter; that we do not believe that the deodorisation of LondonL sewage could be carried on without creating a nuisanco; and that no plan would be effeotual with the increased volume arisng from rain. " 4. That the value of the fertilizing matter contained iu London sewage is undoubtedly gret, but that the I-re quntity of water with which it is diluted preoludes the posEibility of separting more than about one-seventh part of this fertilizing matter by amy known economical proes; that a oopious dilttion of the sewage is neoemry to the health of the Inhabitants of the metropolis; and thatiherefore the sacrfie enild by the dilution must be endured. " 5. That the application of sewage to land, although it may give good resolts under favourable circumstances, and where it can be applied by gravitation overlimited ares, canot be expectod to afford eimilar results in or near the metropols, where the ewarge woald have to be raised to a great hdight, as thi entails a very heavy prime cost and -emulwati.mEve, no sem would be eoeaptet which did not proVide either for the reception and applica. tion of the sae at al times to the lId, and for the snbrequent removal of the Ifquid, or for Its being placd in the rfver at some unobjeotlonable point when not required for lrrfiion; that this would require, In addition to the arrangementa for irrigation, other outfall sewers, almost as extensive- and oosUy as would be required without irriga. tion; and tht a means of plsacing the sewage in the river in au anobjectionable place would, under all circumstanoes, be required during rain. That, looking to the character of the districts near the metropolis, it would be xtremely difficult to finl large and detsode4 arS where It would be possible, by agreement with individuals, to guarantee the constant reception of even a small quantity of the London sewage, while we think it may be a question whether irrigation on a large scale might not oocasion danger to the health of the inhabitants of such districts by the pollution of the air of the district as weU la of Its springs and streams. " 6. That, under these circumstances, and having regard to the ineopediency of making the question of the effectua drtainge of the metropolis dependent on commercial on sideratiorns, the only practicable mode of disposing of the sewage of the metropolis is to provide for its rapid removal from inhabited districts, and for it collection in main outfall channels, where private enterprise, under proper controL may be at liberty to utilize it; bht that, when not required for Purposes of utization, these channels should proide for its flow in the moat expeditious manner into th sea. Ir. "1. That the sewage to be removod being very large in amount, it is not desirable, for this and for other reasons stated in the report, that It should be conveyed from both sides of the river to one outfall. " 2. That the proposed outfall at B* in Erith Reach is objectionable, because It would not effectually prevent the sewage from returing within tho limits of the metropolitan oundary; because it would have a deleterious effect on the health of the district; and becanse it would probably be prejudicial to the navigation. " 3. Thatthebestoutfill on the north side is aplacebetween Muckdng Lighthouse and Thames Haven, in Sea Reach; and that the best outfall on the south side is Higham Creek, in the Lower Hope. "4. That in order tointercept the sewage of a, large area, a level shoald be adoptedalittle above that of the highest tides -viz., five feet above Trinity high-water mark, as the level from which the sewage should gravitate at the River Iea on thenorth side and the River Ravensbourne on the south side; that the sewage should fgow thence into main outfall channels; and that in the main outfall channels mse should be made of tidal water near the metropolis to assist the flow and to effect at the samge time the dilution of the oewage. " o. That the area from which the sevrage would be so intercepted and removed, without h aving recourse to artificial means in the metropolitan distrlits, is about 81 square miles ; and the area from which the sewage would be lifted is nearly 38 square miles. " 6. That with reference to the other districs for which these sewers would provide, the population is very large; hut that the actual amount of sewage which would be intercepted and removed without artificial meas cannot be accurately defiLned without farther levels. " 7. That the cost of the main outfall sewers wll be 3,144,3001., and the cost of the internal system of intercept. ifg sewers in the metropolitan district will be 2,292,965L., and the total cost 5,437,2651. That if the outfall channels werenot carried beyond B* in Erith Reach the expense would ho reduced byAsum of 1, 79.300!_ "8. That, taling into consideration the magnitude of the vworks and the peculiar difficultes of construction, and having a due regard to economy, the works should occupy at least five years in construction. " 9. That aU towns and villages in the line of the ainj outfall sewers should discharge their sewage into these channels, instead of allowing it to pass through the marsh drains into the river. "10. That these districts and all districts round the mnetropolis which make use of the mnain outfall channels should contributo towards the cost of constructing and maintaining these channels in proportion to the number of inhabitants which the districts respectively bear to the whole population benefited, and in proportion to the length of channel made use of by the districts respectively, " 11. That the pollution of streams by sewage through. out the whole country is an evil which is increasing with improved house-drainage, and that it is very desrable that the attention of the legslature should be directed to the sbject with a view to devising means for remedylng the eviL cc In conclusion, we would impress upon you our declded conviction that if the Thames is to be compietely purifiod no plan less comprehensive than the one wkich we have mggested will effect this object. The estimated expense of this pLan is oonsiderable, and some improvement upon the existing state of things might possibly be obtained for a !mUt.gy k ta dnsutjo a X et swwe. dom vAo @otioin; Auk , X which kJ.zpu p.i,. -*g.**i*i1 if aby3r*s.- T?7 pol wouldhu wihwea~ Ffth"" pteeoaj i1mream~f~u TMI di*nt ,r which h1w boa fiqooale oth y I Flive xare "%.kh64N*' stop we MTw beet houd haT whId into -Ahy '6ivilp&i moeo wtit itt. amL we A hAt ti *U b our IuSg for Ute eawlls whiWi a he IA in our zuport.

In abort, "Grisd is a phenomenon to 'Whach thq -lyo at4ge bA. offered scarcely a paalel.

With. his admirable partner 4rio frequently casm forward, and most fre'quently pbo the 'Aimsfaotion ot " VerdistA). in n1 Troatore. The part of M!nrico wes first asseLmed by Mario in IS6, onAhe seeseion of -ignor Tamberl, who left early in the season-!or Rio JanUro. It is now one of the great tenors it 'faeltlesa impersonations, and has materially ihelped to shrengthen the popularity of Signor Verdi's second-beat-cpr (Rigoette being the best) at the Lycenm. The ot4br works in which Maaio and Grisi sang together aro Lueres 2kcrwgia, La Favorita, and Dor Gio'vanzi Besides these, however, and the Duke in Rigoletto, with its immoital " La donna a mobile," Mario added a fiew nnd important part to his repertory-that of Alfredo in La Trcaviaa-of the mauy and strildng excellenoies ot ihicb, ibe opera having been performed so often, it is scareelyneces,ary to remind our readerm. His sirging this zeago&-4or Yario one of more thau ordinar exertion-hai been of the very best, and the patrons of the' theatre never had juster reason to be satisfied with tiir favourite, The very few nights that foind im with voice impairedi and therefore 'I oro'goiy master of his resourcei, were a3 nothing weighed in the balance against those transcendent manitetat-s ot vocal %nd histrionic genius which rzpeatedly proclaimed, to tlhe gratification of connoisseurs, that Mario was still Mario, and unurpassable. Among the rnost agreeable incidents of the seasonwere the various performances of Madame Angioina Bosio, who by dint of natura1 talents and perseverance has rapidly risen to the highest rank ie her profession. This distinguished singer-es s mistress of the art of vocalisatlon second only to one contemporary, over whom she may be said to enjoy the advantage of possessing ana absolate " soprano" voice, -which in the female register, like the " tenorn in the mnale, must always claim a certain supremacy-made her first appearance as Gilda in Bigoteuo. What was said of her on that occasion may be repeated here, since its general tendency eacatly applies to the position now maintained by Madame. Bosio, and will render further remarks unnecessarv e- "The return of that groat and well-deserving favourite, M&dame BoaIo, was an event of more than ordinary interest. fler irmpersonation of the character of Gilda is probably the best ever seen upon the stage, and her execution of thenmusic equally beyond comparison, Rapidly as this acomplished singer mnade her way in the estimation of the English public, it was as the unfortunate daughter of BEigoletto that she first stanspoed herself in the universal opinion as an artist of the highest aider. 'PraiEe has no' been influential in spoiling MAdame Bosio; on theo contrary, it would seem to have exercised a beneficial tendency. At any rate, instead of retrograding, as so many do when they believe they have attained the pinacle.of fasme, sbe atill edvaices-a proof that she presists in devoting hersel conzoiantiously t th study of -br art. The'Gilda, of Madame Bosio is, if posble, even more finished -and complete than before. From the duet with Rigoletto, where the an4ous jester unbowoms himself to his child and warns her against the dangers of the city, to the .uartet where the unts,ppy maoden, though a clhrik in the wall of Soarafucile's house, becomes aware of her lover's intfidehty; and yet cannot find it in her heart to detest him as he merits, her singing was In every respact admirably perfect., As an example of florid execution the air, " Caro nome" (Act 2), may be cited with unqualifiFd praise; and of expreseivo vocalsiation we oould scarcely desire a more charming example than the duet ia which the Duke of Mantua,. disguised as a poor student, wooes Gild& at her father's residence. How delighted were the audience to welcowe Madame Bosio was shown in the unrestrained applause -that rewarded all her efforts, and the recalls after the most.prominent displays. No reception, indeed, could be more tenuine."1 How well Madame Bosio deserved this eulogy was subse. quently again and again demonstrated. Des-ng the season, it is true, she only appeared in two other operas; but these 'were given often and with unvarying success. Her Violetta, in the Traviatat, and her Zerling, in Pra Diavolo, moreover, -were new creations, in both of which she fuUy sustained her high renown. Roncoii, the other great artist of the establishmentalthough.the public had not this time the opportunity of enjoying his inimitable Figaro, or his irresistibly humorous Dtulcama2a-was one of the piUlars of the season. His high tragedy in Chevreuse (AMaria di Bohan), his low comedy in lord PRoeburg (Fra Diavolo), and his Inimitable mixture of the two ii nRigoletto, excited the usuad sympathy and admiration. His Deke Alphonso (Lucrezia Borgia) evisced its accustomed histrionic excellence- and his Don Giovanni once mote proved that the most gifted and versatile of actors mwy yet attemnpt something for which his peculiar idiosyncracy unfits him. The English lord in Auber'e opera -was a new achievement, and merits a place by the side of Ronconi's most racy and genial portrayals. We should regret to believe, nevertheless, that, even regarded as a caricature, it could hit on the ordinary type of traveUling Finglishmen; and yet there Is reason to fear that some few of our countrymen, by extravagance of oostume aud domucanour when in foreign parts, are not altogether exempt from a just application of the satire it aims at conveying. Signor Gardoni appeared in four characters-Arturo T Puritani), Pollio (Norma), Elvino (La Sonnambula), and Fec Diavolo. While exhibiting his usual good qualities in all of these, he was most successful as the Brigand of Terracina, since, if he failed to present a vivid dramatic realiz%tiou of the personage, he was at least thoroughly a, home in tho music, which he sang, for the most part, with admirable sffect. Signor Grazlani's splendid barytone voice was as much extolled as ever, aud his "f l balen," as of old coustituted one of the great points in tl Trovat4ore. As the King, in La Fcaorita, and Enrico, in Lucia di Lammermoor, he well maintained his position; while by bis assumption of the elcer Germont in La 2ravtat Signor Graziani rose a step higher in p&iU- estima. tion, and extorted from the best judges an avowal that he had made progress both as Bisger and actor. Signor lieri Baraldi proved limself not only generally useful as second tenor, but on one or two ocoasions eminently so, a,s a substitute for Mado, at very short notice, in those -P- " 016gnur verC1 Which have so constantly been presnted foee he delectation of the more fashionable patrons of the theatre. Mademoisello Mari, with very little to do, nmaintainied her reputation as "second lady," and in one instance-by her Lady Roeburg (in Fra Diaroto)-enhanced it. Madame Nantier Didiee, the con!ratto, ocie of the most zealous and wompetent artists in the establishment, distinguished herself more than ever in the parts of Di Gondi (Maria di Rohan), Maffeo ,Orsini (L.Irezia), and Azucena the Gipsy, each of which gained her golden opinions; and Signor Tagliafico, ready, active, intelligent, anol versatile as ever, besides those ehs. racters in which he.had already won a reputation sui gencris, achieved fresh and w.ell-merited fame by his original and hiumoroug delineation of one of the robbers in Fra Diavolo. Herr rFoeme. -greatly to-tbener8aldisasnointment. was only at;zu Il one part-tbat Of Leporello, which in many re speOts he understands and represents better than any other know;n perj6raer. Of Mg. i'oloninj, Zelger, and Soldi it is enough to say tha+the afratw'ae AS usual, a model Masetto, the second the rnost portly and-substantial of* Hgh Priests, the 1at the noAt eate.r of subordinate tenors; and that all three, by their careful representation of minor parts, maintained the character of the theatre for general as well as iadividual eflicienoy. Madame Bosa Devries, who sang very rarely, nevertheless made a srong impression s the heroine in 4l7aria di Rlohan ; and Mademoise.le Phepa, a new-coomor (from Lisbon), 'with a good voice and co.siderable talent, nppeared once, and only once, as ElviSa I * the PurUean. Mademoiaellb Cotti was painasakldg as usnaf,\ fi tho small parts with which she was inarusted.

Signor Verdi is very well after his manner, but we must pe careful not to neglect the genuine school of singing too muoh, or some fine day we may lose it altogether. That3Sr. Costa should have continued to sup?ork his own reputation and that of the theatre by his energettc direco tion and the undiminished excellence of his. band and choras Is a matter of surprise to no one. Indeed, it is in what the French call the "esemMle" that one of the great charms of the Lyceum performances consists; and how mnch depends upon the orchestra it is unnegessary to urge. To this desirable result, moreover, no little has been contributed by Mr. W. Beverley as scene painter, &ad Mr. A. Harris, stage-director. The ballet -was stronger this season than last, since, besides Cerito, Mademoiselle Plunltett was engaged, and with an excellent troop of subordinates, headed by Mesdemoiselles Delechautx and Esper, managed to keep up the attractions of the terpsichorean department afterthe departure of her admired and experienced Ipredeocssor. Thus Mr. Gye (by the further assistance of Madame Ristori and the operatic concerts at Sydenham) has been able to weather out another reason in the confined arena of the Lyceum. It is higbly creditable to his management that he should have been able to keep his fine company together under such adverse circumstances; but it now behoves him to exert himself strenuously. The public will expect oWtner the new theatre in Covent-garden for next year, or at least a more spacious and commodious edifice than the Lyceum, which is not only inadequate for entertainments like those by means of which the Royal Italian Opera acquired its European celebrity, but ill adapted for tho effect of music, either vocal or instrumentaL The want of a pit, moreover, often tbrov;s a damper on the very finest performances, and quite disheartens the singers. In almost all theatres " the pit" is the centre from which the says of enthusiasm tend to brighten and encourage the artists, and Grisi, Mario, Bosio, and Ronconi can no more dispense with it than could Siddons or Edmund Kean.

A gtnce at the foregoing will show that the operas produced this year were the Purisni, Norrna, and SonnambuZ of Bellini; Maria di Robjan, Favorita, Lucrezia Borgia, and Lucia of Donizetti; Don Ginxanni of .Mozart; ?ra Diavolo of Auber; the Trovatore. .iaookt!o.. and m raninti of Verdi. Of these the Traviata and Fra Diavolo7 were new to the theatro. A whole season with out a single opera of Rossini is -perhaps unprecedented since the works of that greatest of Italian composers first took possession of the stge. For Meyerbeer of course we must not look uitil the erection of the new theatre; but the total negleot of Rossini seems inexplicable. . The non-arrivalof Lablache no doubtdeprived us of the Barbierc; where, however, were the Conte Ory, Otello, and Mfatilda di Shabran-with Madame Bosio, Mario, Gardoni, and Ronconl in the theatre ?

FATAL COLLI.1Y RXPLOSloA-. ASHTON, SATURDAY ENMNG. Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon an explosion took place in a ooalpit near this town, by which it was at once apprehended tat more than 30 personsmust have lost their lives, and there no longer exists any hope that the estlmate was an exaggeration. This deplorable accident Gcourred at the Heys Colliery, belonig to Messrs. John Kenworthy and Brothers, and Situed on the MIossley-road, at a point within half a mile of the Ashton Town-hall. There are five seams In the colliery, but only two of them have lately been worked, and these are distinguished as "the two-feet mine"' md "the new mine." There are three shafts, one up-cast and two down-cast. At 6 o'clock yesterday morning about 15 men descended to work in the two-feet mine, which is 10G yards down, and another party, whose number is not precisely known, but it was between 30 and 40, descended the No. 1 down-cast shaft to work in the zew mine, which iq 225 yards down, 4 psge about 80 yads l-e bg Sd& 'ra tbe bottom d tls& * the top of an incline, the gradient of which is 1 in . the length 460 yards. The workings are on either side of this incline and of a passage at its extrecaity which turns off nearly at right angles, and runs to the northward for about 900 yards. At the head of the incline was an engine of 30 horse-power employed to draw the coals up the radlent, under the care of an engineer, named Edward hlott. There appears to have beea not the least alarm. until at the time above stated, yesterday afternoon, the neighbourhood was thrown into consternation by the noise of an explosion in the No. l down-cast shaft, twhih shook the i ouses near the pit, and was heard for a very considerable distance around. Almost at the same instant an immense quantity of smoke and dust was shot up with such force as to break the iron plating at the mouth of the pit. The men who had been worklng in the two-feet mine ascendLd by the No. 2 down-cast shaft as soon as they heard the noise. Great numbers of people were immediately attracted to the spot, and among them were a number of men from the neighbouring collieries of the :Fair'oottom Company and of 3fessrs. Lees, who at once proposed to descend the No. I down-cast shaft to the new mine, in which it was feared that all the workers had perished. Underthe superintendence of Mr. Peace, the manager ef the colliery, and Mr. Garside, the underlooker preparations were promptlyn made for stopping up the various openings and restonzg the air currents. As soon as possible Mr. Garside descended the sbaft with a party of volunteers, including several of those who had escaped from the two-feet mine. They -were supplied with bricks and mnortar, straw-bags, tarpaulin, and other materials for stop. ping up the openings of the workings which the explosion hadderanged. Atthe top of the inolinethey found Elliott, the engineer, still living, but severely burnt, and he was conveyed to his home at Dekinfheld. it was found impossible to snake very rapid progress along the incline, but by about 9 o'clock last night the uinderlooker and his assistants had penetrated about 250 yards, searching the workings as they proceeded, and had found the bodies of five men, Further advance was suspended for several hours by the necessity which became apparent of carefully retracing the ground already passed ovor, to take additional precantions against the escape of the after-damp through the openings. About half-pust 8 o'clock Mr. Dickenson, inspector of mines for the Manchester district, arrived at the pit, and remained there during the night, expressing himself satisfied with what had been done to recover the bodies. The difficulty of lar a passage further was very great, but the number of lunteers thaugmented, and the most energetic exertions have been mlade during last night and to-day, the result of which is that 17 bodlies had been recovered by 9 o'clock this lihf-pt 6 o'clock this evening an in uest was opene at the New Ihn, on the Mossley-road. before Mr' W. S. Rutter, the coroner for this division of Lancashire, but the prceedings were confined to the identification of the bodies then recovered; after which the inquiry was adjoured till 11 o'clock on Monday. The followin are thenamesxand otber particulars, so far as they have yet ben ascertained, of the sufferers whose bodies have alrs e oady been found :-George Thompson; Robert Thompson, a boy, son of the above ; Joseph .Bruckshaw ; John J3ramhafll; Joseph Green, a boy; Thomas Gosling, who has lefts wid aftond t 3o children; -Priest, a boyWioiam Nolan, who has left a widow and three chiltdren Benjamnin Greenawood; Wililimii Webb, single raan - Ff liam Catlow; three boys, named Schofield, Howard, and Sfottershead; another 3an, whose name is now yet aseertaied; George Gilbert, a boyu; John Fester.

These two lists account for 2-9 persons, and it is pretty certaini that they do nxot contain the namaes of all who have perished. It is expected that the -whole of the bodies wil have been found early to-morrow (Sunday) morning. Elliott, the engineer, is still alive, hut it is doubtful whether he will recover. Another man is reported to have beenL hurt severely, but not fatally. Ever since the moment of the explosion the ground near the pit has beeni thronged by hundreds of people.

The receipts on the other lines in the unitedkingdom amounted to 288,1491., and for the corresponding period of 1856 to 270,9121.i showing an inorease of 17,2371. in the receipts of those lines,. which, added to the increase on the rmetropo. litan lines, makes the total increa 21,1961. as compazed with the correspoRding week of 1856. The following ar the receipts of railwas for the past week - LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN. The report of the directors of thls company states that the net revenue for the six months ending the 30th of June lst, afterdeductinginterestonloan3 and all otherpreferential oharges, amounted to 163,7901 To this is added 7,042L1 the surplus from the 31st of December las', making the balance availsble for dividend 170,8321. From this= sum the directors recommend that a dividend at the rate of 41. 15s. per cent. per annum on 7,156,0881. of capital, amnounting to 169,)571., bo deolared, leaving a balAnce of 8751. The total receipts for the half-yearending the30th of June, 1856, amounted to 429,6281, the working expenses to 157,63., and thenet revenue to 248,4271., vil'e the total receipts for the half-year ending the 3th of June, 1857, amounted to 408,5011., the torking exneses to 165,6381., and the not revenue to 218,970., showing a decremse in the total receipts of 21,127l., an increase in the working expenses of 7,9001., and a decrense in the net revenue of 29,457f. The amount of traffic arisin" from the naval roview last year, and from the trans mission of troops at the close of the war, caused an extraordinary increase In the gross receipts of the company. The directors think It vrould be more fair, therefore, to compare the first half. ear's traffic of 1857 with that of 1855 than with the first half of 1856. The total receipts on 268 miles for the haf-year ending June 80, 1855, amounted to 368,23S51., the working expenses to 139,6131., and the net revenue to 205,6961.; the total receipts for the half-year ending June 30, 1857, amounted on 277.. miles to 403,5011., the vorking expenses to 165,5381., and the net revenuo to 218,9701., showing an increase in the mileage of 91 miles, of 40,2661. in the total receipts, 25,9261. In tn3 working exLenses, and 13,2741. in the net receipts. The increae in the mifleage run by the trains waS 192,862 miles including 105,725 over that of tho corresponding half of 1856. The suburban traffic and number of residential season-tickets ateboth steadily on'the increase. The amount charged against capital account in thejast half-year on Account of extensions of staions and sidings awas 9,9051., of which 7,1661. was expended on the main line. These sums are in addition to the large expenditure in ordinary repairs, renewals, and restorations charged against revenue. The .'gradual pro. vison of a sufficient amount of working stock is in progress, having in view the new lines and extensions whick are to be' worked by the company, and 20,8601. has iu the half-year been expended and charged against capital on that. account. Dating the half-year two engines in addition to., the stock have 'been constructed out of -the xrennve an, imuch of the old stock has been altered and renew Qo. suit the requirements, at a dmilar cost against reventue4. The permanent way is maintained by the company atnd S isn good order. The gradual relaying a=4 renewal of the line is procoeeding wherenecessary. The new line from Andover to Salisbury has been competed to Ithe junction with the Milford station there, and is now open for traffic. The remaining works on this line to the junction with the Salisbury and Yeovil Company's line, and with tho Great Western station at Fis4erton, are now in' active progress. The result of the Parliamentary proceedings of the present session, as regards the interests of the company: may be considered satisfactory. Under the wers ottained by tae company for the alteration of the tlasingstoke and Salisbury Railway at its western or Fisherton terminus, where it connects itself with the Salisbury and Yeovil line, and meets the eastern extremity of the Great Western system, the eompany will not only be enabled to make a better junction with the Salisbury and' Yeovil Rallway and improve the through line to Exeter but have also secured the means of so constructin their station and works at Fisherton as greatly to facilitate the interchange of traffio between the narrow and broad gauge systems. The directors have. also agreed with the Brighton Company for parti - cipation in the lease granted by the Wimbledon and: Croydon llailway of their undertalking to the Brighten Company. 'The duration of this lease is for 21 years, and the rent 1,8201. per annum. The line is at present-worked by the Brigbton Company at cost price for: the joint a- count, under arrangements between the' two comparies. An arrangement has heen made with the Portsmouth Railway Company for their traffic to pass over this comp any's lne between Gcldford and Godalming, on the abandonment by the Portsmouth Com. pany of their authorized branch from GodImnivg to Shaliord, which would have run for a considerable distance parallel to this compnygsline. Powers have been granted dumink the present session te an independent, company for the construclic* of a branch line of ralav from a point on this c,nny's main line between Wimbledon and 31alden to-- psom. The directors, considering that such a ieheme oueght not to be sanctioned, unless in the, ltauds of tbis' company, who some years since had. promoted a similar project. petitioned against tho BiDl, Ad continued to oppose it, so long as they saw any reason tathink that the urther proNress of the nmeasure coAld i stayed.

STOCKPORT, DISLEY, AND WHALEY-BRIDGB. The report of the directors of this company states that the line as far as Wbaley was opened for public traffic on the 9th of June, and that the result of the passenger traffic hag proved very gratifying. When the line is ready to receive mineral and goods traffic the directors believe thAt an egually satisfactory result wil follow. A Bill for extendng the railway from Whaley.bridge to Buxton was read a third time in the House of Commons, and is expected to pass the House of Lords without opposition. When the line i completed to Buxton a large acceesdon of traffic must necesarily arise. The directors are desirous of Eromoting every friendly relAtion with the Cromford and Egh Peak ailway, as weeU as with adl the contiguous interests, being satisfied that such a policy is the most likely- to advance the prosperity of all. The capital acconnt showed that 176,9401G hd been re ceived to7 the SOth of Jane hast, and 191,8681. expended, leaving a bance of 14,92L ainst the company.
