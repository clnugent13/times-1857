THE GLASGOW POISONING CASE. TRIAL OF MIS MADELEINE SM.IT This trial, which has been for some time looked forward to'withintenseinterest-theprisoner being a young lady lstely moving in respectable, if not high society, inGlasgow, and the fatal event being the supposed issue of a romantic attachment-commenced before the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh on Tuesday. The court was filled from 8 o'clock in the morning, though not to overflow, the admirable arrangements made having prevented all crowdIng. Several seats and galeries were occupied by the members of the Scottish bar and by the writers to the signet; the accommodation for the press was considerably enlarged, but still fuUy occupied, and many hundreds waited outside to compete for the seats which might be vacated In the publio gaUeries. The presiding Judges were the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Ivory, and Lord Handyside. For the Crown there appeared the Lord Advocate, the Solicdtor.General, and Mr. Mackenzie, advocate depute, with Mr. Brodie, Crown agent; and for the prisoner the Dean of Faculty (M:r. John Inglis), Mr. George Young, and Mr. A. Moncrieff, advocates, with Messrs. Ranken, Walker, and Johnstone, writers to the signet, Edinburgh, and Mr. Forbes and Mir. Wilkie, writers, Glasgow, as agents. Madeleine Smith, or Madeleine Hamilton Smith, the prisoner, a very young lady of short stature and slight form, with features sharp and prominent, and restless and sparkling eye, stepped up the stair into the dock with aU the buoyancy with which she might have entered the box of a theatre. During the whole day she maintained a firm and unmoved appearance, her keen and animated expression and healthful complexion evincing how little, outwardly at least, she had snffered by the period of her imprisonment and the horror of her situation. Though on once looking round a dark veil was thrown over her face, the interest she took in the proceedings was yet evident. Her head never sank for a moment, and she even seemed to scan the witnesses with a scrutinizing glance. Her perfect selfpossession, indeed, could only be accounted for either by a proud consciousness of innocence, or by her possessing an almost unparalleled amount of self-control. She even sometimes smiled with all the air and grace of a young lady in the drawing-room, as her agents came forward at intervals to communicate with her. She was dressed simply, yet elegantly. She wore a brown silk dress with black silk cloak, with a small straw bonnet trimmed with white riband of the fashionable shape expoeing the whole front of the head. She also had lavender-coloured gloves, a white cambric handkerchief, a silver-topped smelling bottle in her hand, which she never used, and a wrapper thrown over her knee. Altogether she had a most attractive appearance, and her very aspect and demeanour seemed to advocate her cause. The indictment charged her with intent to murder, as also with murder, and set forth that on the 19th or 20th of February last the pannel, in the house in Blythswood-square, Glasgow, occupied by James Smith, her father, did wickedly and feloniously administer to Emile L'Angelier, or Pierre Emile L'Angelier, now deceased, and then in the employment of W. B. Huggins and Co., merchants, Glasgow, as a clerk, or in some other capacity, and then residing with David Jenkins, or Ann Dathie or Jenkins, his wlfe, in Franldin-street, Glasgow, a quantity or quantities of arsenic or other poison to the prosecutor unknown, in cocoa or coffee, or some other article of food or drink, with intent to murder the said deceased; and that he, having taken the said arsenic or other poison so administered by her, did in consequence thereof, and immediately or soon after taking the same, suffer severe Illness; that on the 22d or 23d of February, in the honse in Blythswood-square aforesaid, she repeated the crime with like intent and consequences; and, finally, that on the 22d or 23d of March. in the saime house in Blythswood-square, the pannel did wickedly and feloniously administer to the said deceased a quantity or quantities of arsenic, or other poison, in some article or articles of food to the prosecutor unknown, and the said deceased, having accordingly taken the said poison or part thereof, so administered, did in consequence thereof, and immediately or soon thereafter, suffer severe illness, and on the 23d of March died, and was thus murdered by the said prisoner. The prisoner pleaded "N ot Guilty," in an audible, though subdued manner. A jury were then impanneled. Mr. A. Smith, one of the sheriff substitutes of Lanarkshire, proved that the declarations were freely and voluntarily emitted by the prisoner, after due admonition and in her sound and sober senses. In cross-examination he said:She was examined on a charge of murder, and the charge vws intimated to her before her declaration was emitted. She was partly interrogated by myself and partly by the Procurator Fiscal. The statements she made were aU in answer to questions. The answers were given clearly and distinctly, and with no appearance of hesitation or reserve, but rather an appearance of frankness and candour. Mrs. Ann Duthie, or Jenkins, was the next witness of importance examined. She deposed-I am the wife of David Jenkins, and live at 11, Franklin-street, Glasgow, The late IL L'Angeier lodged in my house. He cameabont the end of July last, and remained in my house as a lodger till his death. He was sometimes in the habit of staying out at night, but not very often. His general health was good til about January. I recoUect his having an iUness about the middle of February. He had an illness about the 22d of February, but he had also one eight or ten dayd before. The day before his first iUlness he wished a pass-key, as he would be late coming to bed. I went to bed and did not hear him come in. I knocked at his door about 8 in the morning, and got no answer. I knocked again, when he said, " Come in, if you please." The witness was at this stage removed, when The LORD ADVOCATE said he thought it important for the prosecution that the medical witnesses should be allowed to hear the ov.dence of Mrs. Jenkins, who would describe the symptoms shown by the deceased, and which it would be important for the medical men to hear. This was a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court. The Dz.ts- of FA.cuLTY said this proposal took him by surprise. His own impression was that it was desirable that the medical witnesses should be present, but, if so, the medical witnesses on both sides should be ia court. Now, those for the defence were not yet in attendance. If notice had been given of this proposal nothing wonld have pleased him bettor than to agree to it. Tho LORD JUSTICE-CLER1K said the request was somewhat against the ordinary rule of Court, which, so far as he remembered, had only once been relaxed in a Glasgow case, In which no medical report had been prepared. The LORD ADVOCATE said that ia the circumstances ho would not press the application. Witness recalled.-When I went in deceased said, "I have been very unwell; leok what I have vomited." It was a greenish substance In appearance that he had thrown up. I said I thought it was bile. There was a great deal of it. It was about the thickness of gruel. I said, " Why did you not call upon me i" He said, " Onthe road coming home I was seized with a burning pain in my bowels and stomach, and when I was taking off my clothes I lay down on the carpet. I thought I should have died and no human eye seen me. I was not able to ring the belL If you please, make me a little tea, and I think I won't go out." To was now lying in bed. I emptied out what he vomited. I advised him to go to a doctor, and he said he would. He tookadsleep before getting up. Heoslept about an hour. I went back to him, when he said he had had a sleep, and he said he would get up and go out. Mr. Thuot, one of the other lodgers, Eaw him. He got up and went out between 10 and 11. He said he would go to his place of business, but would call at a doctor's first. He returned about 3. He said he had been at the doctor's, and had got a bottle. He took the medicine. He complained in the morning of being very thirsty, and when he returned at 3 he still complained of thirst, but not so much as before. He took the medicine. The ilness made a great change in his appearance. He looked yellow and dull,-not like what he used to be. Before that his complexion vms fresh. He became dark under the eyes, with the red of his cheeks broken. He complained of cold after he came in. He lay down on the sofa, and I put a railway rug over him. lIe got a little better, but never was the same after. I cannot tell what the date of this first illness was. I recollect a second illness about the 22d of February. The second illness was on a Monday morning. He called on me about 4 o'clock. I found him vomiting the samo kInd of stuff he had before-the same both in colour and in kind but there was not quite so much of it, He complained again of pain in the bowels and stomach, of thirst, and particularly of cold. I did not ask him where he had been the night before. I did not know he had been out. I put more blankets on him, got bottles of hot water to his feet, and made-tea, also toast-and-water, and lemon and water, because he was so thirsty. He got a little better and I left him and called in about 6. He was then somewhat better. he kept his bed till the forenoon. He had bought a piece of meat for soup from Stewart, the butcher, in George's-road, with whom he kept a passbook. It is the date of this purcase in the passbook that enables me to remember the date of his second illness. The beef was purchased on the Saturday, and I recollect he became ill on tho Monday morning alter. Dr. Thomson came to attend him on the Monday, I think. Thuot went for him. The doctor left a prescription for powders, for which I sent. L'Angelisr was about eight days in the house at that time, as far as I remember. I rememiber him taking one or two of the powders. He said they were not doing him the good that he expected. Hle said, "The doctor always says I am getting a little better, but I don't feel well. I don't feel I am getting better." He said that frequently to me. Some little time after this be left us, and went to Edinburgh. I think he was about eight daysaway, but I don't exactly remember. Irecellcthis coming bask. Itbinkit was on a Tuesday. r. Thuot told me he wras coming hack, and I got in some (read, butter, and other things for him, (Shown M. If, LA Telier's passbook with Chalmers, baker, St. George's-road. e breadI rgot is entered on the 17th of March. He returned that night about half-past 10. During the time he lived with me he was in the habit of getting a great many letters, but I did not observe that they were in a lady's hand. He received a great many from one hand, but I took it to be a gentleman's hand. The envelopes were sometimes yellow. (Shown envelope 87.) That is the writing he used to receive. (Shown envelope 97.) That is like the colour of the yellow envelopes, and I think it is the same haud; bat I aun not so sure of the handwriting as of the white. He never told me whom the letters were from. I remember seeing the photograph of a lady lying about his room. That is the photograph now shown me. I said once, "Is that your intended ?" He said, "Perhaps, some day." I never thought of the letters being those of a lady. I knew from him he expected to be married about the end of September, 1856: he wished a diningroom and bedroom provided. He told me he was to be married about the end of March, and he would like if I would take him in. I did not agree to do so. There was once during his illness I said, "It is a bad job if you6re badly and you are going to be married," when he said. "You'll not see that for some time." When he came home on the 17th of March he asked if I had any letter for himu. I said I had got none. He seemed disappointed. He came on the 17th, stayedover the 18th, and was away on the 19th. Before leaving he said I was to give any letters to Thuot, who would address them. He told me he was going to the Bridge of Alian. EHe left about 10 o'clock. A letter came fer him on the 19th, quite like those that had came beforo. I gave it to Mr. Thuot. I don't remember that any letter came on the Friday or Saturday. It was more !ike a lady's hand this timae. He had told me he would not be back till the Wednesday next week unless he got a letter, in which case he said, " Perhaps 'llbe home againto-day." The envelope.shownme (137) is like the one that came on the Saturday, but I cannot speak so well as to the other. I next saw M. L'Angelier on the Sabbath night about 8 o'clock. I was quite surprised to see him so soon, and he said, "The letter you sent brought me home." He told me he had walked 15 miles of the way home, but he did not say where he came from. I understood he had been at the Bridge of Allan. Hetoldme to cal him early in the morning, as he was going back with the first train. He was looking quite well when he arrived-more like what he used to be. He said, " I am a great deal better-I am almost welL'. HE went out about 9 o'clock. lHe asked for the pass-key, as he was not sure but he might be late. When I next saw him I think it was about half-past 4 in the morning. The bell rang with great violence. I rose and called, "Who's there?" He said, "It is I; open the door." When I did so he was standing with his arms across his stomach. He said, "Irm very bad- I'm going to have another vomiting of that bile. I thought I would never have got home, I was so badly on the way." Water was the first thing he askced for. I held up the tumbler, and he drank the whole of it. He wished a little tea. Before I got it, and before he was half undressed, he commenced vomiting very severely. It was the same kind of matter he had vomited before. I said "Have you not taken anything to disagree with your stomach ?" He said, " Oh, no; and I never had better health than when I was at the coast," meaning, as I understood, the Bride of Allan. I said, "You never took enough of medicine.' He said he never approved of medicine. He was chiUly and cold, and wished hot water to his feet and stomach. I got this for him. I got a jar of hot water to both. I threw three or four pairs of blankets and two mats over him. He became a little easier, but at 4 he got bad again. I proposed to go for the doctor. He said, "Thank you; but are you not afraid to go out ?" I said, " Oh, no; I'm not a bit afraid," but ho said he did not think I would find the place, and he said he was a little better, and I was not to go. About 5 he became very i again, and his bowels began to move. I told him 4rwoud go to the nearest doctor, and he said I might do so. I went for Dr. Steven. When I went for him he told me he was il and could not come so early. He told me to give him 25 drops of laudanum, and put a mustard blister on his stomach, and if he did not get better he would come. x L'Angelier said he could never take laudanum, and there was no use of mustard. About 7 o'clock he became black about the eyes. and I said I would go and get some doctor, at any rate. I went for Dr. Steven, who came shortly after I got home. I followed the doctor, who ordered mustard immediately. I left the doctor to get it. I did not hear what passed between them, but pointed to the doctor what he had vomited, when the doctor said "Take it away ; it is makin him faint." It had a very sour smelU. I got the mustard and the doctor put it on. He gave him, I think, a little morphia. The doctor stayed about half an hour. While he was there M. L'Angeier complained of pain in the forehead, hut the doctor said it must be an inward pain, as there was nothing outwardly wrong. I asked the dector if I could do anything else, and he said it was only time and quietness that was needed. I called out the doctor aside as he was leaving and asked what was wrong. The doctor asked if he tippled, on which I said, "Oh, no-quite the opposite." ie said it was just like what happened with people that tippled. I told the doctor this was the second time he had gone out weU and come home badly. The dootor said, " That will be an afterwards explanation." When I went baok the deoeased asked me what the doctor said. I told him he said he would get over it, when he said, " rm far worse than the doctor thinks." I went two or three times back, when he said if he could get a little sleep he would be better. I went in about 9 o'clock, and he looked very bad like. I said, " Is there no one you would like to see P" He said, "I would like to see Miss Perry, Renfield-street." I sent for her and she came, but not before his death. After this he said, "Oh, if you please draw the curtain; if I could get five minutes' seep l think I would be better." I left him, and was back in five or ten minutes. I came quietly out, thinking he was sleeping. The doctor caie in, and I told him he had only newly falen asleep. He wished to see him. He felt the pulse and raised the head. I said, "Is there anytbing wrong?' He said, "- Draw the curtains aside; the man is dead." I had no reason to know or suspect where he had been, but I knew he was in private correspondence with some lady, and I did not like to ask about it. Miss Perry came, but too late. I sent for several persons, who came. Mr. Stevenson, one of Huggins's young men, came also. I wished him to take charge of his effects, and he did so. They took a letter out of his pockets, and one of them said, " This explains all." I saw the letter. I said, " Thats the letter that came on Saturday." Cross-examined.-His first illness was greatly worse than the second. About the end of January hebad a sore thumb, and several boils broke out upon him. When ho became sick I said I thought it was bile, which I am troubled with myself, though my symptoms are not so violent, but what I have vomited was something like. He had also a good deal of purging as well as vomiting. He dined at home on the Sunday before his second illness. I remember his taking fresh herring that day, which I said I thought was not good forhim, astheherrings were out of season. Ionce told him that he used too many vegetables, when he said when he was at college he used a great many vegetables, and never was the worse for them. I cannot remember if he went out on the Sunday night, the 22d of February. I think I would have recoUected his going out by his asking for the check-key. As far as I recollect, he was not out that Sunday night. I do not remember his bringing in any medicine, except after his first illness. There were, however, eight bottles left on his mantelpiece, one of them being laudanum. The authorities got them away about a week after his death. On coming home on the Sunday night from the Bridge of AlUan he had a little tea and cold toast. I did not see him go out. I was aware of his being at the watereloset before going out. A great deal came off his stomach the morning he dhed. The chamberpot was quite full when the doctor told me to empty it. He was also purged a great deal After going for the doctor the first time I gave him a little hot water, which made him vomit more. He wanted to go to the watereloset. [ said, " Oh, no; I am a married person. I will bring another chamberpot, and we will keep what you have vomited tiU the doctor sees it." Among other things the doctor suggested was laudanum. There was some in his press, hut he refused to take it, " Besides" he said, "It's not good, it's been standing without a cork." After the doctor visited him the doctur, in answer to my inquiries, said, "H He'll get over it the same as before." I think I recollect his complaining of h s throat when the doctor was there. The doctor gave him water, which he complained was like to choke him. He was stretching out his arms all the morning, butIdonotrememberhis hands beingelinched. Tbe right hand was clinched when he died. Miss Perry, I think, came in the forenoon. When she came, I asked, " Are you the intended ?" She said, " Oh, no; I'm only her friend." I had supposed, on her being sent for, that she was his intended. I told her he was dead. She was much overwhelmed, and cried a great deal. I was qi surprised at her grief. I teok her in to see the cy, which as then laid out. When she told Dme she was not the intended I said how sorry the lady would be. Miss Perry kissed the forehead several times. Miss Perry said how sorry she was for his mother. hI. L'Angelier told me he had had an illness about the end of August. ile said his bowels had been very bad, and ho had not been in bed all night. I was from home for six weeks in August and September. In re-examination the witness was shown the clothes of the deceased, which she identified; also his portmanteau. When I said to Miss Perry " How sorry the lady will be" she told me not to say much about it, or anything about it. By the COURT.-When I asked whether he had taken anything at te Bridge o Allan to dia with h Ihad - ;A.. eoflanaM,,-. , ,ev. ~ ~-Ih noiea Of his having-taken anything tbat would do him ill after he had got back to Glasgow. He said "No, I took nothing to make me ill. I never felt better than when I was at the coast." I did not ask him where he had been, thinking he had been visiting his intended. My husband was from home during all the time deceased stayed with us. le only saw him once, at the New Year time. The witness was complimented by the Lord Jaustice Clerk for having given her evidence in a very clear and distinct manner. She had been nearly three hoers under examination. James Heggie, salesman to Mr. Chalmers, baker, and John Stewart, butcher, weTe called to prove the dates of the entries made in ,i. L'Angelier's passbooks on the two occasions referred to by Mrs. Jenkins. Other witnesses vwere examined to prove his having stayed in Edinburgh from the 10th to the 17th of March,and his again hurriedly visiting it on the 19th, lest any letter should have been sent to the post-office there for him. Mrs. Bain spoke to deceased arriving at Bridge of Allan on the evening oF the 19th (Thursday), and staying there tll Sanday afternoon, when he unexpectedly went awav Charles Rutherford, late postmaster of Bridge of llan, proved the stamp on a letter which M. L'Angeher had received on the Sunday nmorning, as re-addressed to him by M. Thuot. William Fairfoul, guard of the railway train that left Perth at 2 26 for tho south, deposed to deceased coming in at Stirling at 3 30 (there being no stoppage at Bridge of Allan), and going as far as Coatbridge, the nearest station to Glasgow, and eight miles distant therefrom (the railway communicatiug to Glasgow with the Scottish Central and Caledonian lines merely, the Edinburgh and Glasgow having no Sunday trains), Thomas Ross, auctioneer, Glasgow, who, was also proceeding from Stirling to Glasgow that Sunday, deposed to having walked in wvith deceased from Coatbridge, the latter being in good health and spirits, their walk in occupying little more than two hours-namely from a quarter past 5 to half-past 7. The last witness in croisg-pamiistion said,-lie told me ho had come from Allo that morning, and that he had walked thence to Stirling, a distance of eight miles. He said nothing about having been at the Bridge of Allan, that I remember. On our way we spoke of the scenery and other indifferent matters. He told me he had been in Stirling, that he had presented a check at the banl;, which they wonld not cash, he being a stranger. We went into no house on our way. He did not tell me who he was. William Stevenson deposed,-I am a warehouseman in the employment of Huggins and Co., Glasgow. The late X L'Angelier was in my department, under me. He had leave of absence for some time in the month of March. He I was to go to Edinburgh, and I understand he afterwards went to Bridge of Allan. I got a letter from him from the Bridge of Allan, in which he stated that he was much better. and was wvlling to return whenever he was called upon. I senthim an answer, stating that I wzas glad to hear he was getting better and enjoying himself. This letter was never received by the deceased, and was recovered by me at the post-office, Bridge of Allan, after his death. I was sent to Bridge of Allan to take possession of his property there, and I caled for this letter. He had been four years and a half in Messrs. Huggins's. I got notice of his death on the 23d. and sent for several persons to come. Drs. Thomson and Steven examined the body, and in consequence of what they said I gave information to the Procurator Fiscal. I did not expect M. L'Angelier to return to Glasgow so soon. A letter was found in the vest pocket of deceased. It was as follows:- Wy-, msy beloved, did you not come to me? Oh, beloved, are you Ill? Come to me, sweet one. I waited and waited for You, bat yeo came not. I shaU wait agaia on yon to-morrow night, same hour and arraugeneut. Do comn. sweet love-my own sweet love of a sweetheart. Come, beloved, and dasp me to yoar heart; come, and we shall be hapDy. Alkia, fond love. Adien, with tender embraces Ever beliove me to be your dear fond *- " nMI When I found that letter I said, "This letter explains why he was in Glasgow, and not at Bridge of Allan" I did not know who " Mini" was. Witness was further examined as to the memorandumbook of deceased, and some discussion took place as to whether its entries should be read, which the Court decided should not be received at this stage of the proceedings. The cross-examination of the witness was deferred tiU next day, and the Court adjourned at 6 o'clock tillMWednesday at 10. (BY xir;ecnu AD Ti i ATONA TEUGRAPH.) SECOND DAY. The trial of Madeleine Smith was resumed at Edinburgh yesterday (Wednesday) morning. William Stevenson was further cross-examined.- He deposed that there might be from 250 to 300 letters found in repositories of deceased. There was a large number of them in the handwriting of Miss Perry; probably one-third as many as those of Miss Smith. This witness's evidence showed there had been considerable irregularity on the part of the prosecution in the means taken for the attestation of the documents. Dr. Hugh Thomson had attended deceased on various occasions, and in particular about the end of February, when he had severe vomiting, which witness then ascribed to a bilious attack. After the death an examination of the body was made by witness and Dr. Steven. Their report stated that death might have arisen from irritant poison, or from internal congestion, caused by cold or fatigue. Dr. Steven gave the particulars of deceased's last illness, and corroborated some of the former evidence. Professor Penny, of Glasgow, had examined the stomach of deceased, and found it contained about 88 grains of arsenic. He had also found arsenic in some other organs of the body. Except one bottle, containing aconite, no poison was found to have been in possession of deceased, and if the bottle had been full it would not have been sufficient to destroy life. ie considered it very dangerous to use arsenic as a cosmetic. In cross-examinationwitness said a greater portion of the arsenic would be vomited offif administered in a solid than if in a liquid form. A lrge dose would necessarily exclude many vehicles through which it might be administered. He could not recall any case where so large a dose had been taken involuntarily. Professor Christison of Edinburgh, had ex amined soFne white pow'der given him by Professor Pi'enny, itisaving been found in the stomach of the deceased. He found it to be oxide of arsenic. The symptoms of L'Angelier's case as described by him were just what he would have expected in a case of pcisoning by arsenic. In cross-examiination, the Professor said that as large a quantity of the poison might have been vomited off as was found remaining in the body. An unusually large dose must have been taken in this case. In cases of suicide by arsenic the doses were generally very large, but there was often an excess of means used even in cases of murder, and this sometimes led to its detection. Amadee Thuot deposed to being with deceased on one occasion when he tapped at a window near Blythawood-square to hand in a letter. He afterwards pointed out the window to a policemau. He understood him to have secret correspondence with a lady. Auguste Vanvente de Mean, Chancellor to the French Consul in Glasgow, know of L'Angelier's intinmacywiith Miss Smith. Some weeks before his death witness told deceased of a report that she was to be married to some one else. L'Angelier said that must be false, but that he had documents in his possession which would at least forbid the banns. He saw Miss Smith shortly after deceased's death, when she denied having seen L'Angelier on the Sunday evening. He questioned her about the letter received by deceased at Bridge of Allan, on account of which he had come home, and asked her how she could explain it, she being engaged to another man? She said she had made the appointment for Satarday evening, which he did not keep,and her purpose in writingto hina was to try to get back her letters. In cross-examination witness stated that deceased had once become suddenly sick after taking a long walk with him at Helensburgh; that he had spokea of having had cholera; that he was in the habit of taking laudanumn, and had once had a conversation with witness as to the probability of taking arsenic without dangerous results. The Court adjourned till next morning (this day).
MILITARY AND NA-VAL INTELLIaENUE. The first detatchment of the 3d battalion Rifle Brigade, numbering eight officers and 126 men, under the command of Brevet Colonel Glynn, left Aldershott yesterday for Portsmouth, to embark for India. The other detachments will follow on the 9th, 22d, and 26th inst. On Tuesday morning 13 officers and 266 men, constituting the left wing of the 60th Regiment, left Dablin for Kings. town, where they embarked in the Medina transport for Colombo, Ceylon. The names of the officers were as folow: -Maor Hobbert, commanding; Captaias Barnes, Tupper, Bunbury, and Thompson; Lieutenants Lee, Leaeh, Meyer, and Edge, and Assist^nt.Surgeon Davies. The Captain Cook, transport, is at present lying in Kingstown harbour, and will this morning take on board the headquarters of the 50th, consisting of 18 officers and 384 men, two officers' wives and five children; and 28 soldiers' wives with 38 children will likewise take their passage in the same vesseL On Tuesday the Lord-Lieutenant, with a large military party, held an inspection of the 79th Regiment and of the battalion of the Rifle Brigade recently arrived. Among the dark ranks of the latter two men were conspicuous who had recently received the Victoria Cross for " valour" from the bands of their Sovereign, beside other well-won proofs of daring in the recent Crimean campaigns. The sailing three-deeked shipPrincess Charlotte, 104, Captain George St. Vincent King, which left Portsmouth on Friday last in tow of the steam frigate Leopard, for China, and whose progress, in consequence of the news from the East Indies, was suddenly arrested in the Channel on Snnday morning, left Plymonth finally yesterday morning at half-past 4 o'clock. She got under way on Tuesday afternoon, but the hawser by which she was attached to the Leopard having been snapped by a strong breeze from the south-west she was detained untilyesterday. The Princess Charlotte, while lying in the Sound, was inspected by Brigade-Major lbbetson, forthe purpose of ascertaining her capacity forl the conveyance of troops to India. There was ample space for 300 men, but tho lower dock ports being caulked it was impossble to secure sufficient ventilation, especially for the tropics. The Princess Charlotte is ordered to touch at Madeira for water, and to set up her rigging. After calling at the Cape of Good Hope she proceeds direct to Hongkong. She has the spars and rigging of a O0-gun frigate, and mounts only 12 guns. Her officers and crew are 490 in number. She has a large quantity of shells and ammunition for the army, and paints, oil, tar, machinery, &o., for the fleet, and it is supposed that on arrival sho wil! be converted into a barrack-ship. Vice-Admiral of the White Edward Harvey, C.B., &c. arrived at Sheerness on Tuesday evening, and yesterday his flag (white at the fore) was hoisted on board the Formidable, guardship of ordinary. The Victor, 6, screw steam gun vessel, Commander Alger non F. R. De Horsey, was paid off at Sheerness on Tues day. Lord Bloomfield, Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Berlin, went yesterday, accompanied by the Dowager Lady Bloomfield, Major hl611er, and a numerous party, to Woolwich garrison, and were present at a field-day of' the troops on the common. In anticipation of his Lordship's visit the squadron of Royal Horse Artillery, in command of Colonel Wood, C.B., and he remnant of the field battery corps, in command of Colonel Teesdale, were ordered to assemble in field-day order on the review ground. Major-General Sir W. F. Villimas resumed the cotnmand of the garrison for the oc. casion, and proceeded to the ground at half-past 12 o'clock, accompanied by his vaitors, and attended by Colonel Bloomfield, Aide-de-Camp to the Queen and Second Com. msndant of Woolwich, Brigade-Major Shaw, LieutenantColonel Teesdale, Aide-de-Camp to the General, and a nmnerous staff in undress uniform. On their arrival the band of the corps performed the national anthem, when the troops commenced marching past, retired to the left, and approaching the centre fired a volley, which was repeated with extraordinary rapidity several times. The rain induced the company to withdraw, when, after a few evo. lutions, the troops again wheeled put and retired to quarters. The visitors thence repaired to the gymnasium, after an inspection of which and vsiting the Institution. Museum, &c., appertaining to the establishment of the Royal Axtillery, the party (consisting of about 20 relatives and personal friends of Colonel Bloomfield) were entertained at a repast in the mess-room. They subeequently witnessed three rounds of mortar practice performed by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Fortesot's 6th company of the 11th battalion. 21 shells were fired at an elevation of 45 degrees over a range of 600 yards at the usual butt, a flag-staff erected on the common. The practice was prononnoed extremely successfuL The vistors left Woolwich at 5 o'clock, and retarned to London. A number of extra hands have been apnointed to complete the screw steamship Edgar, building at Woolwich, which is ordered to be completed for being launched iabout April next. A new steamship of similar dimensions or thereabouts, to be called the Anson, is ordered to be laid down in the same slip after the launchof the Edgar. The freight ship Liverpool, in the London Docks, is taken up by Government to embark military stores from Woolwich Arsenal for Hongkong. The freight ship Earrowby is likewise chartered by Government to convey Ordnance stores from Woolwich for Hobart Town. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty,- Commander Gabriel Johnston, to the Coast Guard servioe; Lieutenant G. T. H. Parker. to the Ganges; W. Dyer, to be Secretary to Vice-Admiral Earvey; Francis J. Davy, Assistant-Surgeon, to the Boscawen - David Porteons, Assis~tant reon, from the Impregnable, to Plymouth Hospital; J.w. Lesy, Assistant-Surgeon, to the Ganges; Simon Willis Assistant-Snrgeon, from the Victory flagship, for EIaslar Hospital; x. W. Cowan, to the Victory flagship; Thomas M.Ramsay, Paymaster, to the Boscawen; H. C. Lory, Assistant Clerk, to the Boscawen.
BOYAL SURREY GARDBNS. The 10 days'-expanded into 16 days'-festival having terminated, with a success that surpassed expectation, and M. Jullen having departed on his summer tour, a new attraction is now offered to the patrons of the Music-ball in the shape of tbe justly celebrated military band of Guides from Brussels, who have obtained a short leave of absence from His Mlajesty the King of the Belgians. Last night they made their fart pearance, underthedirection of their able and eperienced conductor, Mr. Bender, and performed a variety of compositions, to the great delight of an audience more enthusiastic than numerous. The weather was very unfavourable; but this did not prevent the concert from being one of unusual interest to the admirers of military orchestras and military music. The band of Guides, which is as old as the reign of King Leopold, upon whose accession to the Throne it was institated, has always been renowned among the regimental bands of Europe - and mnany eminent instrumentalists have been formed and perfected in its ranks, which they have only quitted on findmig more lucrative employment elsewhere. It is now in firstrate condition, boasting solo players of distinguished ability and a discipline that may fairly be pronounced unexcelled. On assembhng in the orchestra the foreign musicians were loudly cheered, and after performing our National Anthem the courtesy of the audience led to a call for that of Belgium-ia reply to which the Brabanronne was executed with equal success. The performances of the Guides included the overtures to Obeiton and auillaumc TeU, a " selection' from Verdi's opera of Terusaelm, arrangements of Weber's Invitation a la Valse and of the slow movement from Beethoven's Sonate Pathitique, Meyerbeer's Tordb March, and a melody composed by M. Bender, in which the talents of the chief solo performers wero effectively displayed. The execution of these pieces was admirable, and the applause bestowed upon one and all of the heartiest kind. The overture to Guillaume TeU-which we never heard more splendidly executed by a military band-was encored, and the last movements repeated. The Guides, in short, achieved a complete triumph, and will doubtless sustain, in the absence of hi. Jullien, the musical reputation of the Royal Surrey Gardens. The concert was agreeably varied by the singing of Madame Gassier, who, as usual, both surprised and gratified her hearers in Venzano's " Zingarella" and Rossini's "Una voce poco fa"-both being enthusiastically received-and further by the excellent choir attached to the establishment, which, under the direction of Mr. Land, gave Mendelwsohn's lovely part-song, "0 hiUls, 0 vales of pleasure," and Pearsail's madrigal, "0 who will o'er the Downs so free," with perfect style and undeviating intonation. Mr. Alfred Mclon conducted the vocal solos.
ONLY A RAILWA Y ACCIDENT. TO THE, EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-I was an eye-witness of the appaUing results of the collision which happened on the North Kent Railway last Sunday evening ; but I do not write to you now to Dresent to your readers' minds-woald to God I could banish them from my own !-the horrors of the three hours spent in endeavours to rescue my unfortunate fellow-travelers from the prolonged tortures to which those of the Inquisition alone afford a paralleL. Some of the eircumstanoes, however, of this shocking story, which might not otherwise be brought to notice, may be, through the medium of TI*e Times, of some value. The confosion from first to last was frightful, and the delay in procuring the mechanical contrivances which alone could have brought relief to the sufferers was sarely needlessly prolonged. Nothing could be done to extract the bodies of some of the sufferers without jacks and powerful pulleys, and levers-for the mass of one carriage had been hurled upon another, and had crushed and buried the wretched traveller4 in the lower carriage in the most complicated and hideous and apparently inextricable manner. To all our applications to the railway people for jacks we had for a reply that they had been sent for. Considerwhatthe exigencywas. There was one poor lady whose leg was jammed between the wheel of the upper carriage and the iron and woodwork of the lower, who was beseeching us to raise it only a little and she could be saved. I saw her thus fixed for more than an hour with an impending mass of splintered beams and ironwork threatening to crush her every moment. Close by her waS a poor fellow whose body hung down through the bottom of the carriage, but whose left leg was likewise in a vice by which he alone was supported, except when some of us were able by turns to hold up his head by creeping under the carriages. One great evil which we encountered in our efforts to extricate the sufferers was the thronging of the mob and the absence of control and organization. No doubt, we received assistanca, from the police in certain respects, for they brought more lamps-a thing of material importance, as there seemed at one time a chance of the medley of broken woodwork which enclosed the poor creatures being set on fire by the torches which were improvized. I can speak personaUy as to the use on this occasion of a little organization. I found on ranning up to the place where the screams and groans of agony were issuing two young men already at work. At the risk of being crushed and mangled by the dislocated heaps of iron, wood, and glass, they had crawled under the broken carriages, which were pressing alike on the dying and the dead, and witb indomitable courage, energy, and skill gave direction to one or iwo who could help how to apply our force. One of these, whose face I could not see, adoptedthe plan of communicatinz to the stranger who asisted .dm by a number. Ee had found a young woman hut little hurt, but almost hopelessly buried, and transfixed by her clothes in a most frightful position. By giving directions, and by the help of a clasp-knife, and by literally cutting and tearing her out of her clothes, we were able to extricate her from being erushed and suffocated-a fate which befell a poor woman next to her. I believe it was this latter who whispered to me as I supported her head, "Shall we be saved?' I begged her to keep up her courage, and assured her shewould be saved-for I then thought tha' in a few more minutes we should have had the screws and tackle which might have availed-but this was not to be Just before the carriage was thrown over on its side, which was the only mode at our command of getting at three people, jammed in a bopeless condition, I saw her dead and cold, her face quite black. The efforts o these noble fellows, who were thus working for upwards of two hours, were rendered all the more dangerous and frightful by the noise and folly of many who injudiciously were attempting to move the mass by pushing it over. It is clear that if this had been done those wbo were lending their aid inside would have probably'been killed also; but they risked this, and did, by what I may call their own heroism, and their skillin obtaining and organizing the assistance which they could obtain, much. Even all the noise and bluster and stupid bustle around could not prevent this. So foolishly and dangerously, indeed, were some of the 'mob acting that I had to leave my coadjutors on several occasions on the alarm being given that the carriages were about to be purposely upset, and crowbars and levers were being fatasy introduced into the massive and dislocated ruins of the carriages and the limbs of the wounded. I literally saw one loud-talking and stupid man about to use a crowbar so as to make the instep of a poor felow the fulcrum of the lever. The immediate neighbourhood of the accident ought to have been kept clear, and, though it is too much to expect themost able commander, or director, to be necessarily forthcoming on such an occasion from among the officials, still something may be expected of these people-perhaps to the extent of activity in obtaining the requisite mechanical appliances and free space for the operation of volunteers. I do not speak of the causes of the accident; these must be investigated. But Sunday's experience tells xmid. that when accidents of the kind in question do occur thWe best remedy is competent assistance in men and material. No doubt, the particular form of the accident on the North Kient Railway, which consisted of people being buried alive in a mangled state, WaS a very terrihle one to meet. I saw what some of my fellow-travellers did ander the circumstances, *ad I saw also what other people both did-and did not, Your obedient sorvant F. Temple, June 30.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. CEYLON. The report of Captain W. S. Moorsom on the Ceylon Government Railway states thatthe hill country of Ceylon in which Kandy is dtuated rises as a mass not less than 1,500 feet above the sea level, and Is enctrcled on its west and northern sides by mountains, of which none of the passes on those sides are less than from 1,500 to 2,400 feet above the sea. The intermediate ranges vary from 3,eoo to 6,000 feet, rising in peaks to more than 7,000 and in one case to more than 8,300 feet above the sea. The length and breadth of this tract may be about 60 miles each way. TIe general level of the low country is about 200 feet above the sea, extending from near Colombo eastwards some 30 miles from the shore, rising thence in ridges varying in altitude from 500 to about 1,300 feet above sea level, rendering the next 20 miles a mountainous country. After 50 milesfrom the coast thero is noescape fromtbemountains. The reportis very elaborate and g,ives a particular account of the survey of six lines between tolombo and Kandy. It states that No. 1 would be 79 miles in length, the rnlfnggradient 1 in 60. and hiave an inclined plane of 1 in 20; No. 2 would be 82 niles in length, the ruling gradient I in 50, and have an expensive tunnel; No. 3 would be 79 nilos in length, the rling gradient 1 in 60, a thort tunnel, and the summit level would be 1,780 feet; No. 4 would be 79 miles in length, the ruling gradient 1 in 50, and the summit level 1,7t70 feet. No. 5 would he 83 miles in length, the ruling gradient I in 45, and the summit level 1,800 feet. No. 6 would be 95 miles in length, the ruling gradients rerepeated frequently 1 in 60, and the summit levell,600feet. The cost of No. 1 would be 800,1501., and the estimated trafflc receipts 1,40OI. per mile per annum; of No. 2, 776,1751., traffic receipts 1,500L per mile, or 14 per cent. per annum on the cost; of No3,706,5571., traffic receipts 1,6001. per mile, or 15 per cent. on the cost- of No. 4, 736,9501., traffic receipts 1,6001. per mile; of No. 5, 752,0251., traffic receipts 1,1001. per mile, or 10 per cent. per annum on cost; and the cost of No. 6 would be 953,5001., and the estimated traffic receipts 1,0001. per mile, or about 10 per cent. on the cost. Captain Moorsom recommends the route No. 3, from Colombo to Kandy vid Parnepettia, as being that which combines the greatest amount oLpublicaccommoda. tion and-themost remunerative prospect. After minutely desribing the course of the line he states that it attains its summit level of 1,690 feet above the sea at the east end of a tunnel 750 yards in length, near the EIindoo temple of Wallapolla. he line then descends from the 64th mile. With regard tothe levels of theline, they undulate for the first 48 miles out of Colombo, and in no instance exceed 1 in 132 for that distance. After 50 miles from Colombo the rapid rise of the basin of the Maha Oya is met by a gradient of 1 in 70, steepening to 1 in 66, and runming up to Gordon's-bridge station (where every train must stop), with more than two miles rising 1 in 60. From Gordon's-bridge totbe summit, a distance of nearly lOA miles, the line is a continued ascent of 1 in 60. From the suamit at Walapolla the line descends with easier gradients to the Mahavilla, and rises thence to Kandy, nowhere exceeding an inclination of 1 in 132. He does not approve "large English capitalists" or a "first-rate English contractor" un ertakmng this railway, as it would put 150,0001. at least into the pocket of some person, who would appear to deserve that bonus because he would give timid seare holders and ignorant directors the assurance or guarantee that a fixed amount of expenditure would not be exceeded. But that guarantee would include, at the least, the above amount of bonus, and the company and the Ceylon Government are alike interested in saving this by organizing a jadi. cious system of moderately.sized contracts, suited to the means of those who are ready both in Ceylon and in India, as well as in Great Britain, to give in tenders for the execution of portions of the works. The estimate is for a railway18 feet wide, and with cuttings on the average sloping I to 1, and embankments sloping on the average 14 to L For a mile at each station the railway is to be formed 30 feet wide, and proper sidings in addition are estimated. It would be a single line, with a double line at stations. The land is estimated for 30 feet in width throughout, and an electric telegraph is estimated with three wires. Out of the 79 miles of railway to be formed about 50 miles are either side cutting or ditching, and the remainder alone will require waggoons and rails for takiDng the excavated material to embankment. The comp any must organize an efficient and well paid staff of skiful engineers, under a chief who can control and keep in perfect and harmonious action 5,000 or 6.000 people. The estimate of 856,5571. includes the purchaseof land, the workLng stock, and the cost of the accessory establishment during the execution of the works. He does not think it desirable to open any portion of the railway before the whole length is completed, andetimates the receiTts for the first year or two at aboutlll,5387 per annum, o icluding 86,0007. for goods; the working expanses at 53,0001., or48o per cent., leaving 58,5381., or about ni per cent on the eatimatedoost to meet the guarantee, and it Is supposed that the traffic dill afterwards go on in- REPORTS OF COMMrTEES ON RAIWAY BILLS.

MlEDICAL PROFESSION (No. 1) BILL. ir. HEADLsp M moved that this Bill be read a seconi thme. Mr. CRAUFIJRD, in moving that the Bil be read a second ime on that day six months, glanced at the history of former attempts at legislation on the subject of medical reform. In the course of last year, he said, his hon. and learned friend (Mrr. Headlam) introduced a measure, on which considerable labour had been bestowed, and which, to a great xtent eliited tho united support of the medical profession, more especially of the large body of practitioners constituting the Provincal Medical Assoolation. To secure the unanimity necessary to give a measure of that kind a fair chance of success, it was framed on the principle of a compromise. With the viow to carry out that spirit in the fullest sense, and to do justice to certain Universlities and other bodies concerned in the question, his noble friend (Lord Elcho) thought proper to bring forward a second Bill, when the whouse, having regard to the magnitude of the interests involved, and anxious to avoid hasty legislation, decided on reading both of the measures a second time, and then refering them to a select committee, The task entrusted to the committee was that of investigating the merits of the varous compromises uanggested by Soth o the Bills,- in order, if possible, to gather from them some means of settling a long dispute. Most of the gentlemen who composed the committee were members of the present Parliament; and though they entered upon their iquiry with the greatest discordance of opinion, yet, by dint of the most careful attention to the subject, together with an earnest determination to arrive at a practical result, their differences were gradually eliminated, and they ultimately came to an unanimous conclusion. The consequence was the framing of measure considerably modifying the one proposed by the hon. and learned nember for Newcastle, and assuming the form now presented to the House by the Medical Professdon (No. 3) Bi, introduced by the noble lord the mpembereforHaddingtoashire. In the shape in whih that Bill came down from the committee it almost entirely coincided with the measure proposed by the Przovincial Medical Association, though in some of its details it departed from it in order to conciliate the corpobations, which threatened to offer to it a streng opposition. Everything was in a fair trnain for the solution, in a manner satisfactory to all parties, of a very difficult and tangled question, when unfortunately the late period at which the conmimittee concluded their labours rendered it necessary that the matter should stand over till another session. Since then his bon. and learned fniend (Mr. Headlam) introduced a Bill last session, which he ;presumed was the samo as the Bil now under discussion, but which, owing to the dissolution early in the spring, was not printed. Now, it was certainly not a little extraordinary, after therc bad been a complete investigation of this subject by a committee, that his bon, and learned friend should almost wholly disregard the decision of that committee, and should again intreduce a BiU nearly identical with that brought in by him in the session of 1856. He regretted this exceedingly, because, when they had got so far on the road to a reform of the medical profession, it was hardly wise to take what appeared to him a retrog,rade course. What were the provisions of the Bille It completelyrcnsulted theninterests of the corporations, compelling every person who had passed an examination and who was to ab entitled to prac tise, to become a member of some one of these corporati, so and, what was more, it confirmed in perpe uthe to these bodiesdtheolargetfeeswhichmost people thought it sodesirable to abolish. Now, he (Mr. Craufurd) did not want to upset vested interests, hut he was certainly indisposed to perpetuate an expensive system like that now existing, and to continue these corporations in the possession of privileges which were no longer suited to the spirit of our times. Hlis noble friend (Lord Eleho) made no such proposal. Bill No. 3 dealt tenderly with vested interests; it did not sweep away the medical corporations, which had undoubtedly done m uch good in their time, and which might continue to ho beneficial to the profession if put on a sound basis;* but, on the other hand, it did not compel studentsbef ore they could be admitted to practise to lpay heavy fees to these bodies. It required that students should pass a preliminary and a professional examination, that there should be a minimum of qualification; it constituted a board of examiners from the corporatiens and the universities which now exercised tho privileges of admitting to practise, thus preserving the importance oF thee bodies; but it enacted that the title to practise shoUld no longer be absolutely given by them, but should be one subject to the approval of the examiners appointed; and lastly, it did not compel gentlemen to pay large fees. Another distinction between the Bill of the noble lord and the hon. and learned gentleman referred to the medical council. Last session he (Mr. Craufurd) confessed that he was much wedded to the principle of a representative body. He thought it very fair that the profession should regulate itself, and that if it were possible to concoct v workable council on the representative principle, that would be the proper course to pursue. He must say, however, that the discussion which had taken place in the commnittee upstairs, and the consideration of the evidenco brought before them, had induced him to change hi oninion Though in theory a representative council might be thought the best, he was now convinced that it would he impossible for such a body to work in a manner satisfactory to the profession; that from its size it would be unwieldy and unmanageable, and that though nominally basedon a system of representation, it would not have within itself that element which was essential to its proper working-namely, the element of responsibility. (Hear, bear.) On' the other hand, however objectionable in principle might be a council nominated by the Government, a body so constituted would certainly be responsible to the country tbrough Government; the head of the council would have a seat in that House; and thus you really carried out the principle of responsibility to the public; whereas by the BllR of the hon. and learned gentleman, though you got the shadow of responsibility, the substance would in reality evade you. These were the main features of difference between the two measures proposed on this ,ubject, For Jib own part, hs owned that he thought the Bill now more immediately under disecssion was in no way calcula.ted to advance the interests of the medical profession, though it would increase the privil-ges of certain corporations at the cost of the public. The Bill of his noble friend would reduce the expenses of students by requiring them cimply to pay a small fee on the first preliminary general examination, and a somewhat la. er fee on admission to the profession upon the second examination. These two comparatively small fees would replace the enormous ones now levied, and thus a great boon would be bestowed on the profession. He opposed the Bill of his hon. and learned friend, because he would not, by throwing this sop to the corporations, attempt to conciliate bodies which had hitberto stood very much in the way of medical reform; and he begged, therefore, to move that the Bil be read a second time that day six months. Mr. BLACK seconded the amendment. Viscount BURY, as a lover of representative institutions, could not but approve the Bill submitted by the hon. and. learned gentleman (Mr. Headlam) in preference to one based on the principle of Governmeut nomination. (Hear.) The bon. and learned member for Ayr (Mr. Craufurd) had pointed out the inexpediency of placing power in the hands of corporations which had already proved themselves incompetent to exercise it, but it should be remembered that though these licensing bodies might have failed, when acting singly, to use their power with good effect, that was no reason why they should fail when they were able to combine with one another for the advancement of the common object. (Hear.) The noble lord's Bill called upon the House to believe that the President of the Board of Health would send to the council better qualified persons than these licensing bodies, composed, as they were, of men who had devoted their whole lives to the study of their profession. He feared, too, lest this system of nomination should be made use of as a political engine: that when one partywas in power the most necessary qualification for members of the council would be that they should be good Whics, and so with the other side of the House. In one point he certainly loolked upon the Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman as superior to that of the noble lord, because it pro. vided no exclusion for what were called medical heresies. If such men as Jenner and Harvey had lived under such a Bill as that of the noble lord, he had no doubt that, owing to the jealousy which unfortunately always distinguished an exclusive profession, they would have been placed beyond the pale. The measure brought forward by his hon. and learned friend provided that there should be no such exclusion, and this, among other reasons, would determine him to veot in its favour. Colonel SYeES said there were parts of beth BiUs to wehich he objected. Each of them professed the same desire -namely, that of raising as high as possible the standard of qualification in the medical profession;* and each proposed urther thatiindividuals who passed certain examinations should be then entitled to practise throughout the British dominions without further imlediuent. The object of the Bilstherefore being the same, the question turned upon she difference in their machinlery. In the first place, he would express his entire concurrence in the principle of re- ,resentation as opposed to that of nomination by the grown. HIe thought, however, that the Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman unnecessarily multiplied examinations and fees, while the noble lord's measure accomplished the object in vew much more simply and cheaply. (EIear.) Then, again, the university element was ignored in the Bill of the hon. and learned member. It ap. peared to him that such a university as Marischal College should have its diplomas accepted with the utmost confidence throughout the British dominions. By Bil No.1 the Universities of Glasgow, St. Andrew's, and Aberdeen were to send one representative to the general council, and if they could not agree in their choice it was left to the Crown to select any one of the three names so sent up. Now, this was an Lidignity offered to the Scotch Universities which he thought quite sufficient to condemn the Bill of the hon. and learned member, which he should, therefore, feel bound to oppose, while he must also vote against the noble lord's measure because it was based on the objectionable principle of nomination. CAMBRIDGE ELECTION COMMITTEE. Mr. DEASY appeared at the bar with a report from this committee, to the effect that the Marquis of Blandford had not attended at its meeting that morning- and that he (Mr. Deasy) as chairman of the committee Lad received a letter, from which it appeared that the noble marqtuis's absence was caused by the alarming ilness of the Duke of Marlborough. Since then a communication had reached him from the Marquis of Blandford stating that his father's death had subsequentlytaken place. He (Mr. Deasy) begged to move that, under these circumstances, the Marquis of Blaudford should be discharged from further attendance on the committee. Mr. GROGAN inquired whether it would be competent for the election committee to proceed in the absence of one of their number? The SPEAXER said, the Act of Parliament distinctly provided that they might do so. The motion was agreed to. The debate on the Nedical Profession Bil was then resumed by Colonel FRENCII, who thought the amendments of the noble lord (Lord Eleho) might be introduced into the BiU of the hon. and learned gentleman when they went into committee. ("No l") The noble lord intimated his dissent, but hewasboundto rise and state his reasonswhythe House should now refuse to read this BiU a second time. The noble lord's name appeared on the noticepaper as the mover of an amendment against the Bin hut he had chosen to delegate this duty to another. It might be that he wished to have the last word, but it was only due to tbe House, after the notice he had given, that the noble lord should put himself into the front rank. Mr. W. BWART did not think the noble lord was oalled upon to answer the question just put to him. (Hear, hear.) With reference to the general principle of the two Bils, he acknowledged that there was somethiog very fascinating in the system of representation, but, after mature consideration, looking to that which was essential to the value of any measure-namely its workable character, he was inclined to support the Bill of the noble lord. Under its provisions there would be in this House a person who would represent more or less the mnedical bedy and who would be responsible to Parliament. The noble viscount (Bnry) had suggested that this nominated council would assume a political character, but he did not see that there was any objection in this argument which would not apply equally to the Board of Customs, the Board of Inland Revenue, r the Board of Trade. Of the two Bils he (Mr. Ewart) certainly preferred that of the noble lord, which was more rational in its character, which respected but did not obey the medical corporations, and which, he believed, was more consonant with the wishes and interests of the medical practitioners generally. Much, therefore, as he admired the theory of representation, he should feel bound to vote against that principle on the present occasion, and in favour of the Bill of the noble lord. Mr. MITCHELL thought the medical profession more than any other required to be governed by a representative system. The most eminent medical men had always been of at opinion. All writers on this subject agreed that those who intended to become medical practitioners ought to receive first a preliminary course of instruction, and next a strictly professional course ; and that there should be a system of registration of such men as were deemed competent to practise. He should therefore sunpport the Bill of the hon. and learned member for Newcastle-on.Tyne. The dis. tinction between surgeons and physicians, it was said, ought to be abolished, inasmuch as it was invidious; but he believed that it secured to the publio greater comipetency in each of those professions than there would be if the two professions were brought to one dead level, as was proposed by the Bill of the noble lord (Eleho.) It would be unwise to destroy those ancient institutions under which the medical profession had attained a position which was most creditablept tshe practitioners themselves and to this country. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BLACK beleved that the best test of a medical man's competency was the opinion of the public, and that, however rigid might be the system of medical examination, men incompetent to practise would succeed in obtaining eertifi. cates of competency from the examiners. Headmitted that before a man was allowed to practise as a surgeon or physician he ought to be examined as to his shill by competent persons; but why should he, after having obtained a certi- cate of hi competency, be called upon to enter into a corporation, to submit himself to its regulations, and to pay certain fees? There ought not to be any class distinctions in the medical profession. Those who had attained the higbest eminence in this country as consulting physicians probably started in their public career by attending to infantile diseases. From mere surgeons theyrose I their perseverance and the increased confidence of the pubic in their abilty to the position of distinguished physiians. He suggested that whatever was beneficial in this Bill should be engrafted on the No. 3 Bill, which he regarded as a beter "stock." That part of the Bill of the hon. and lea ed member for Newcastle-on-Tyne which provided that there should be a council of representation was unanimously opposed by a deputation of Scotch medical practitioners, and so strong was the feeling among the medical profession against that provision that the Secretary of State for the Home Department assured the deputations that waited upon him that, although the Government, generallyspekng were in favour of the Bill, they would oppose that part of it. He (Mr. Black) objected to the Bill, because it gave such immense power to the corporations of the profession (hear), aupaescrs cinuoisrwie Oneof itsclauses,-. proniied that in the c-a-s-eof a practitioner removnge from one part of the kingdom to another he should not be allowed to practise in the place towhich he had removed until the expiration of two years, so that he must remain perfectly idle for those two years. He (Mr. Black) had no desire to injure the ancient medical institutions; they had been of great service to the community, but he thought it should be optional with physicians or surgeons to enter them, and not compulsory. The majority of the profession would no doubt have the ambition to seek admission into them. No person was compelled to enrol himself a member of the Geographical or the Geological Society, and entrance into the medical corporations should be equally voluntary. It was not on the privileges which they might confer, but on his skill and good condnut that a practitioner ought to rely for his success. Mr. GROGAN said the singular feature of this debate was that all the members from the north side of the Tweed supported the Bill of the noble lord, Lord Elcho. -"No."1 while the members from the other side of the Irish ChanneI supported that of the hon. and learned member for Newcastle-on-Tyne. The hon. member who had just sat down wanted to have free trade in the medical profession as well as in manufactures, but all States had found it necessarv for the sake of the publio safety to prevent the care of the public health from being intrusted to incompetent men. (Hear, hear.) The Government could not dispense with a compulsory system of education as a preliminary to the practice of the medical profession. The BiU now under consideration was preferable to Bi No. 3 and he suMested that some of the provisions of the latter Bill mnigt be advantageously engrafted upon it. Almost the whole of the medical societies were unanimously in favour of it. The medical profession had attained high eminence without Government interference, and he hoped that that House would resist any attempt to place it under the control of a Government nominee. Mr, NJ3ATE deprecated the growing custom of under- valuing those ancient institutions which had done good ser-- vice to the State, and of turning them to purposes for which they were never intended. Free trade and unrestrictod competition were very good in but very bad out of their place. (Hear. Free trade was a very good servant, but a very bad master. It was to monopoly that much of£our p,rogress in arts and sciences was due. That zemark applied to the medical more than to any other learned profession. Did the House wish to see free trade extended to the legal profession or to the church? The noblelord (Elcho)asked them to enter upon anew course entirely at variance with that which had been pursued for many generations, and which had raised the medical and other learned professions to a degrec of eminence, dignity, andusefulness which they had not attained in any other country. He was speaking, however, as if the Bill of his hon. and learned friend would sanction a monopoly, but it would do nothing of the kind. It would admit everybody without distinction to qualify himself for the medical profession, but itwould alsorequire, as it ought to do, that those who had been long connected vith that profession should ascertain whether he had in fact so qualified himself beforo he was permitted to practise. The College of Physicians was, no doubt, for a time actuated byanspirit ofsel6shness andelusiveness, butithadrenounced that spirit, and was determined to meet, as far as possible, the requirements of the present state of society. (Hfear.lj It was for the interest of the State at large to maintain in some shape or another professional aristocracies, for if they were destroyed the only other aristocracy which remained -that of wealth and position-would be placed in a more isolated and insecure position than before. (Hear, hear.) Mr. VANCE supported the Bill of the hon. wrember for Newcastle on the ground that it was a measure for the reform of the medical profession, while the Bill of the noble lord was one of entire reconstruction, and in some cases of entire destruction, of existing rigqts and privileges. He thooght that the different degrees of the profession recognized by the Bil were of Irat importance; but the hon. member for Ayr had described the bodies who were to conduct the examinations as being beyond the spirit of the age -as being, in fact, obsolete bodies. When it was considered, however, of whom those bodies were composed, he thought that that observation could not be maintained. He regretted that the Bil No. 1 did not deal fairly with the apothec^ries of Ireland. That bill, however, properly provided for existing and constituted rights, while the Bill of the noble lord destroyed them altogether. It appeared to him, moreover, that the BiU of the noble lord did not provide sufficiently for the preliminary education of the practitioners. He thought that the House should pursue the constitutional course in this matter, and reform existing institutions rather than destroy them. Mr. T. DUNCOMBE said, that there were no fewer than five Bils connected with tho medical profession upon the notice paper of the day. They only wanted the Poison Bill, which was blundering its way through another place, to complete the list, which was, to a certain extent, brought to a close in that House bythesecondreading of the Burials Bill. (A laugh.) In al these Bills he saw no provision whatever made for the interests of the public. We had already State religion and State education, and it was proposed now that we should have State physic. To that he objected. He objected both to BiU No. 1, and to Bill No. 3, and as No. 3 Bill was opposed to No. 1, he should vote for No. 3 as against No. 1, and he should return the compliment by voting for No. 1 as against No. 3. (A laugh.) What the public required upon the subject was that aU medical practitioners who underwent a fair examination should se puaced upon an equal footing; but the examinaion should not be altogether conducted either by a council composed of professional men or of nominees of the Crown. It was notorious that the chartered bodies had always stood in the way of improvement. The first man who introduced the tourniquet had been persecuted for it; the German practitioner who introduced cantharides as a cure for dropsv was incarcerated in Newgate at the instance of the head 6f the College of Physicians. In the words of Sir Authony Carlyle, physic after all was an art founded on conjecture and improved by murder, and instead of appointing a council, therefore, composed of the chartered bodies, he would say "1 leave the Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons, the one to prescribe for and the other to operate upon the Murb.i,and it the Apothecaries Company drench them intoduc(A laugh.) Be was opposed to the system of renistraton, and thought that nothinm could be more humiliatinr to the professioun tha to reoister and number them like the drivers of hack cabs. Mr. BLARSE supported the Bil ono. 3) which had been introduced by the noble lord the member for Haddingtonshire, and believed that the majority of the members for Ireland would be found to take the same view of the case on the ground among others that the other Bill inflicted a great inJustice upon the apothecaries. lvr. BRISCOn supported the second reading of Bill No. 1lon account of the composition of the counciL. Under this measure the councii would consist of 17 representative members and of siX nominated by the Crown. Ame six were to benominated membersthere would be no difficulty iu having one of them a member of that House, whie the 17 representative members would insure the confidence of the profession and of the public. So far from agreeing, there. fore, with his hon. friend the member for Finssuryt he be. ieved that in voting for the second reading of this Bill, he was honestly and conscientiously consulting the hest interest s of the public. Lord ELCHO said, thattle hon. member for Roscommon had described the course which he (LorddElcho) hadpursued in this matter as an extraordinary one. Feeling that to a certaiu extent he was so, and admitting the justice of thnt remark, he must ask the kind indulgence of theHousec while he endeavoured to showv that it was by a sense of public duty alone that he had been actuated in the course which he had taken. (liear.) It was the more necessary that be should do so because his motives had been subjected to misconstruction both byon the professon the pubeec out of doors, and it had been stated freely that his only object was either to obotruct medical reform or to rival his hon. friend the member for Newcastle as a medical reformer. tow, with respect to obstructing medical reform, he assured the House that he was much too sensible of the necessity ofE some measure of reform with reference to the medical profession to throw any impediment in the way of it. The anomalies at present were so great and sO injurious that he had long felt it to be desirable that some measure of reform should be carried into operation. He would just mention to the House three of the anomalies of the present system In the city of Edinburgh there was a distinguished profes. sionalman, Professor Simpson,who was, perhaps, as eminent a man in his branch of the profession as any one in the kingdom. He was physician to Her Majesty in Scotland; but, tunder the present state of the law, if he were to be called to London in consaltation with any of Her Majesty's physicians on the subject of Ier Majesty's health, he would be liable to be prosecuted for practising within seven miles of London. Surh of the population as resided within seven miles of the metropolis were the property of the hoyal College of Physicdans of London-that ras their hunting ground; and H any medical man from Dubln or E dinburgh came to attenda gentleman inuLondonwith who-e constituhon he was acquainted he would be lihle to be prosecuted. (HZear.) Again, the degree of the London University was considered one of the highest medical testimonials in the world; and a London University graduate might practise in any part of Great Britain except within seven miles of the very place where was situated the university f ro which he obtained his degree. (Hear.) The third anomaly was that the Archbishop of Canterbury possessed the nower of granting medical degrees without examination. (tearI. Theahon. member for Finswury had quoted the analogy of the hackney cabmen with respect to registration. He (ord Elcho) wvould follow up the figtre, and he mid that the present state of the law with regard to the medic::l profession was as absurd as if the cabmen in Palace-yard, with certain badges round their necks, could only convey gentlemen to Belgrave square, and that those who asked to go to Hanover. square must procure a cab from some other quarter (tio, hear.) So far from wishing to rival his hon. friend as a med cal reformer, it would be sufficient to state that when his hon. friend gave notce of his Bill he (Lord bEcho) asked him if it were the samenas that whichhad been recommended by the select committee on which they had both sat last session, stating that if it were so any sort of assitance which he could give him was at his service;and it was only upon fninng that his hon. friend's Bill ws not the amended Bill of the committee, but the very same Bill, with the excepion of some alteration in the conssti tion of the council, which his hon. friend had brought in at f t commencement of 18r6, that he determined to oppvee it. He did not pretend to be a more practicalmanuthaa others, hut he ventured to think that if they wishedito pas a good measure of medical reform the practical course woald be to take up the Bill in the amended state in which it had been left by the committee at the end of 1856, and not to take it up as it had been introduced at the begintning of 1856. (Elear, hear.) He (Lord Elcho) stood by the Bill of the committee, and he asked the House to reject the Bill of his hon. friend, with the view of substituting in its place the Bill of the select committee; because, whatever the fate of the committee's Bill might be, he ventured to predict tat te Bill of his hon. friend could not pass into a law. No less than three pgs of the Parliamentary votes were; filled with notices of amendments upon the BiU of his hon. friend as originaly introduced. Altogether there were 51 amendments on the paper, and inasmuch as every principle of that Bill which was objected to at the timewas to be found if possible in a more aggravated form, in the present Bilt, he left the House to judge what chance it would ever have of passing into a law. He wished to discuss this question upon some broad and intelligible principle, because it appeareT to him that that was the rule which they ought to lay down for themselves upon the second reading of a measure, in preference to dealing too much with matters of detaiL But first let him read to the House the names of the members who composed the select committee of last session. The members were Ur. Cowper (in the chair), Mr. Headlam, M.. Brady, Mr. Craufurd, Sir W. Heathcote, Mr. Napier, Lord R. Grosvenor, Mr. Black, Colonel Dunne, Mr. Bell, Mr. Strutt (the present Lord Belper), Mr. A. Hastie, Mr. Percy, Mr. Howard, and Lord Elcho. He considered that committee to have been fairly constituted. Upon it wero the three members whose names were ou the back of the Bill of his hon friend, and altogether he believed that there was no improper element in it. He had nevs r sat upon a more unanimous committee. Indeed, so unauimous had they been "upstairs," that he had ventured to express a hope that their proceedings in the House upon the subject of medical reform would be charaoterized by equal unanimity; and, with the exception of Colonel Danne, who was no longer a member of the House, they aU agreed to support one another upon the guestion. To return nowv to the question of principle. The principle of the Billof his hon. friend was that of giving a monopoly on thesubjeot of medical education to the medical corporations. Upon that ground he (Lord Elcho) was opposed to the BiU now; upon that ground he had been opposed to it last year; and upon that ground he should continue to be opposed to it so long as it contained the principle in question. At the present moment ere were 21 licensing bodies in the united ukingdom. Of hose,, 11 were uiversities, and nine were corporations, the 21st being the archbishop of Canterbury. (A laugh.) His bon, faend in his BiU gavc the wh-ole licnsing power to the corporations, and to the corporations alone. It was true that in tho council he gave a certain amount of power to the univeraities, bat evea in the council the proportion given to the universities was not fair in comparison with the num. ber given to the corporations. By the Bill of his hon. friend also every member of aununiversity was compelled, before he could be recognized. to be examined by one of those corporations. Moreover, he was compelled to join one of those corporations, and there was an extraordinary clause in the Bill which obliged every gentleman who had passed the necessary examination to reside two years in one country before he could- be registered in another. The only reason for that, so far as he had been able to ascertain it, was this. There had always existed a certain degree of jealousy of Scotchmen and Scotch doctors, and even the cheers of that House when expressions of a dopreciatory character with respect to Scotchmen were made use of evidenced that the feeling still existed. It had been shown by Smollett in BodeeriK Random, for Roderick Random when he went up for examination hefore the College of Surgeons in London was asked where ho came from. " From Scotland," was the reply. " Of coursenone but Scotchmen come here-you Scotchmen overspread us as the locusts did Egypt." (A laugh.) And he (Lord Elcho) well remembered that the late Dr. Buckland in his lectures at Oxford related as a curious fact that the footprints of the palaeontological tortoise invariably tended southwards, and that there was no instance of their footprints tending northwards-a remarkable illustration of the tendency of Scotchmen to go south and never to returan! (Laughter.) To justify the principle of his hon. friend, that the whole power should be given to the corporations and taken from the universi. ties, his hon. friend should show, as the hon. member for Oxford had endeavoured to do, that monopoly would work well for the public. The hon. member for Oxford stated that he did not see why the medical profession should hot regulate itself in the same way as the clerical and legal professions did. He (Lord Eleho) wasnot aware that the medical profession held the doctrine of apostolical succession, unless, perhaps, those members did so who had received their degree from the Archbishop of Canterbury (a laugh); and as regarded the legal analogy, he made bold to say, even in the presence of so many luminaries of the law, that the opiniou had long prevailed, among laymen at all events, that distinguished as that profession was, still it might have been improved if admirdon to its ranks had been obtained, not by the payment of fees only, and by the aptitude of the stomach to digest a certain number of dinners, but by somne system of practical examination upon the practice and theory of the law in its different branches. (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman the member for D Ublin University was so sensible of the objecton to the manner in which the legal societies admitted members to the legal profession, in consequence of having eaten so many dinners in hall that he moved for the appointment of a Royal Commission on the subject. They had not to do in that clause with theory, but with practice. They found the practice of licensing to be in existence on the part of the universities. It existed in the case of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and it practically existed in the case of the Scotch and Dablin Universities, and in the case of the Qaeen's Colleges. This right on the part of the former universities dated from ancient times, and they had a recent instance of the recognition of that right in a Bill which in 1854 passed through that House, for the purpose of extending to Iondon gradnates in the unfortunate position he had referred to the same rights and privileges which were extended to those of theUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was an extraordinary fact, too, that among the warmest supporters of that Bill sanctioning the principle that university degrees licensed for practice was the hon, member for Newcastle himself, who supported an amendment to the effect that the University of Darham should be put on the same footing. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, he repeated that, as regards this country, the prindple was recognized by old charters, and was sanctioned by a Bill in 1854 that universities might grant licenses for practice. What was the state of things on the continent? In France the sole licensing power was the University of Paris; in Germany it was not the profession, but a Government board which licensed; and in Italy the same rule held good. The right of the Scotch Universities to granS medical degrees originated in bulls of the Popes, in which it was stated that the same rights, privileges, and immunities were conceded as were held.by the Universities of Paris and Bologna. If, then, this had been the practice both at home and abroad, he thought some strong ground should be shown why, when it was attempted to remedy the defects of the medical profession in these liberal and anti-monopoly days, a monopoly should not only be perpetuated, but that the holders of that monopoly should have privileges given them which they had not heretofore possessed. Head this practice worked badly, aud were theuniversity medical degrees so inferior those given by the medical coporations ? On this poant he would read a letter sent by Dr. Reid, the Examiner of the Uiniversity of St. Andrew's, to the comnmittee which satiunIS47. Professor Lawrence, a d istinguished member of the College of Surgeons, had stat,ed that the Scotch degrees were valueless, and that he would not trust the smallest union to the charge of a medical offlcer who only held a Scotch degree. Dr. Reid thereupon wrote to the committee a letter in which he stated, speaking of St. Andrew's medical degrees:- "No degree is granted without a regular and stringent examination, in accordance with regulations in force since 1826. In 1840 there were 30 candidates, of whom sin were rejected; of the six rejected one possessed no diploma, four were members of the Royal College of Surgeons of London, and one was a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In three years previous to 1845 there were 71 candidates, of whom 12 were rejected; of the 12 rejected, six, or one-half, were members of the Royal College of Surgeons of London; some of them also held the diploma of the Apothecaries' Company. In 1846, out of five licentiates of the Royal College of Surgeons of BEinburgh who presented themselves, three were remitted to their studies. In 1847 there were 49 candidates, of whom 11 were rejected; of the rejectedseven were members of the Royal College of Surgeons of London, one licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, one licentiate of the Dublin Apothecaries' Company; some of them like wise were licentiates of the London Anothecaries' Company." What, he asked, were these medicat corporations ? They were merely medi.eval guilds like those of the grocers, shoemakers, and other municipal institutions dating from the same time; but the existence of old charters giving the universities the right of licensing showed clearly thae they possessed the right long before these medical corporations. At that time all learning, whether legal or medical, was centred in the universities, the members being ecclesiastics. In 1163 a law was passed which forbade the shedding of blood by ecclesiastics, and in conseuence of that law the ecclesiastics selected the barbers who staved their heads to bleed for them, and that was the origin of the Barber-Surgeons' Corporation. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Hon. gentlemen in their walks, not at the Westend hut in out-of-the-way parts of London, had perhaps seen over a barber's shop a pole painted in various colours, but might not be aware what it was intended to represent. The pole represented the wand formerly held by a patient when undergoing the operation of bleeding, and the stripes round the pole represented the ribands by which the patient's arm was bound up. (Hear.) The connexion between the barbers and the surgeons was particunlrly exemplified by the shield of the Edinburgh Royal College of 13urgeons, which up to last year bore on it the emblems of shaving,razors,and so forth. On turningtothe Eucyclopccdia he found that in the time of Henry VI i. the physicians, and also the Barber-surgeons of London, were incorporatpd, and those two bodies overstepped theirjurisdiction by prosecuting those who did not belong to either, so that it became necessary to pass an Act in 1543 for the protection of the irregular practitioners. In 1606 James L incorporated the apothecaries, uniting with them the grocers (laughter), and they saso began to proseente as soon as they had obtained their privileges. He had now shown the House the origin of these medical corporations, and their true character was to be found in the Act of Henry VIIL, which enacted *- " Whereas it was enacted that no person within the city of London, nor within seven miles of the same, should take upon him to exercise and occupy as a physician or surgeon, except he be first examined, approved, and admitted by the Bishop of London and others; sithence the making of which said Act the Company and FeUowship of Surgeons of London, minding only their own lucres and nothing the profit or ease of the diseased or patient, have sued, troubled, and vexed divers honest persons (as weU men as women) whom God hath endued with the knowledge of the nature, kind, and operation of certain herbs, roots, and waters, and yet the same persons have not taken anything for their pains or cunning, but have ministered the same for God's sake and charity; and it is now well known that surgeoas admitted will do no cure to any person but where they shal know to be rewarded with a greater sum than the cure extendeth unto, for, in case they would minister their cunning to sore people unrewarded, there should not so many rot and perish to death as daily do for lack of surgeons ;" as well as in the preamble of the hon. gentleman's Bill. Now, he asked hon. members whether in 1857 they found old corporations, such as the city of London for instance, managing the affairs with which they were intrusted so well that they would grant to these medical corporations, the relies of ancient guilds, powers which they had not heretofore possessed ? It was asked, not that they should have a fair share of power-to which he should not object-but that they should have a completemonopoly. It was on these grounds that he asked the House to reject the Bill of his hon. and learned friend. (Hear.) As it might be for the convenience of the House to have but one discus- sion on both the medical Bills standing on the orders of the day he should now say something in support of that Bill which he asked the Hlouse to substitute for the Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman. The reasons which induced him to bring that Bill forward he had aleady stated to the House. Mr. T. DUNCOMBE rose to order. He thought it irregular to discuss during the consideration of one Bill the merits of another standing in the business of the day. The SPEAKER said, that as in the course of the dis. cussion that day there had been a constant referenco to both of the BiUls, it was rathor too late now to interpose to prevent the noble lord entering on the statement he was about to make. Lord ELCHO said that, fortified by the decision of the Speaker, and also by the example of the hon. member for Finabury, who had himself referred to both Bills (a laugh), he should proceed to point out to which Bill the preference ought to be given; and he here would observe tbat he felt the full force of what had fallen from the hon. member for Finsbury,to the effectthattheyshould be asliberal as possible and not restrainthe profession by needless restrictions. The Bill of the committee of 185S, which he proposed should be adopted, proceeded to effect its object in a totally different way from the Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman. The main objection raised against the BiU of the committee by those who were opposed to it rested on the constitation of the council. They urged that the council ought to be representative and not nominated by the Crown. He did not consider that provision in the Bill to form the principle of the measure, the important question being whether the House would give a monopoly to these corporations or not. That was the principle involved in the Bill, and the constitution of the councl was a matter for consideration in committee. This form of council was adopted by the committee of 1856, not to give irresponsible power to the Crown, but because they considered it offered the best gnarantee for the constitutdio of a good counQil, It waS thought that if the council were nominated 'by the corporations the members would go to it as mere delegates of those corporations, whilo a good council might be nominated by the Crown. Nevertheless, as objections were still raised to the nomination of the council by theCrown, the committee of 1856 made, as a check on any irresponsible exercise of power, a responsible Minister in that House the bead of the council. At that time the President of the Board of Health, who was now in a moribund state, was in ful existence, and that officer was accordingly taken as -he natural head of the medical council, which would to a certain extent have to act as a board of health. Now that that office was nearly abolished the H ome Secretary or some other public official in that House might be substituted. However, this point, as he had said before, was matter for consideration in committee, bat the question whether ai monopoly should be given to the medical corporations was not matter for consideration in comsjittee. The noble lord then referred to the payment of fees under Mr. Headlam's Bill, and intimated that the object was to get as much money as possible for the corporations out of the pockets of the profesidon, while the Bill of the committee of 1856 did not take that view, for aU the fees for examination were to be paid into a common fund, and the council was to distribute that fond for the expenses of registration, the payment of examiners, and in aid of museums. He had stated generally the difference between the two Bills, but he did not wish the House to take the character of the Bil he advocated from any description of his, for it might be said that he was a Scotch jobber. Let the House take the testimony, not of any interested party, but of the medical corporations themselves. He held mhis hand a petition from the Dublin Corporation of Apothecaries, and it stated that the amended Bill of last Eession " is characterized by an equitable adjustment of the vested rights of all parties, and at the same time contains adequate security for a suitable education, preliminary and professional ;" and the petitioners prayed that the amended BUl might be passed into law. (Hear, hear.) That was the opinion of one corporation in Ireland. and he would now a8ls state what was the opinion of the Edinburgh Colege of Physicians. When the Bill came out of commitree last year that body drew up a paper, in which they stated - " The amended Medical Bill has appeared to the College of Physicians worthy of support, and they earnestly trust that it will be passed in the present session of Parliament, because it wiU put an end to the constant agitation which has prevailed in the profession on the subject of medical reform for many years past. It will secure in the fulest ossble manner that equality of priviege which has long Deen contended for; it wiUl secure a good minimum standard of education; it will not interfere with the higher grades of the profession, but will leave colleges and univers ties unfettered in elevating the standard of qualificatiou for those honours which they are entitled to bestow ; it will, for the first time, render imperative a proper preliminary examination; it will save those practitioners whose position merely requires the lowest qualification the necessity of passng more than one examination, by combining the representatives of several into one efficient examining board; it will provide an authorized register, which wil at once show who are legally qualified practitioners, and what are the qualifications which they possess; it wiUl provide for such of the museums and other adjuncts of the existing incorporations as are of real public benefit, without rendering them dependent, as heretofore, on the fees of those whom that particular body may pass; it wiU for the first time introduce some sort of government in place of the present anomalous state of the profession by means of a council, which, if judiciously chosen, may succeed in harmonizing the various conilicting medical incorporations and universities which have never yet been, nor are ever likely to be, able to adiust their several claims for regulating the profession. While, in our opinion, it wiU inflict no real inJury on the incorporations, it will give great satisfac. tion to that large section of the profession who are unconnected with these bodies." Now, let him adduce the opinion of the British Medical Association as given last year in reference to the amended BilL There was first a meeting of the committee, from which resolutions were submitted to the whole association, and passed. Those resolutions were to the effect that the provisions of the amended BiUl carried out the principles which the association had always contended for, and the association stated that they were desirous of seeing the BiU at once passed into a law. It was Madame de StalE, he thought, who said that the opinion of foreigners was the same as the judgment of posterity, because it was removed from prejudice; ant he might here observe that he had receivedaletter from amedicalman inJersey stating that the profession there were most anxious that his Bill should bh extended to the Channel Islands. (Hear, hear.) Ho should not trouble the House with any more arguments in favour of the Bill, but would proceed to meet some of the objections urged against the constitution of the council, because it was nominated by the Crown. He repeated that he did not hold that part of the Bil to constitute the principle of the measure, but he wished to sbow that other persons beside the committee of 1856 considered the constitution of the council not objectionable. A gentleman, whose name could never bo mentioned without honour, had drawn up a most able analysis of the two Bills. Mr. Warburton, the gentleman he referred to, said, on the part of the senate of the University of London, that that oody greatly preferred the constitution of Lord Elcho's council with its committees, to the constitution of MIr. Headlam's general council and branch councils. Again, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh last year suggested- " Whether there is not a danger that delegates sent directly by the corporations, or by any public bodies, would notbeholikely to lean too much to the interests of those bodies, and therefore the less to those of the publio and the' profession in general 7" and therefore proposed-- " Thatthe number of the council should not exceed 12. That the President of the General Board of Health shonld be the chairman of the medical council." So, after having followed the opinion of these corporations, the members of the committee of 1856 found the corporations now coming forward and denouncing the Bil as astrong interference with their rights. Such inconsistency was monstrous. The Xoyal College of Surgeons was active in its opposition to his BiU in the present year, although last year a petition from that body to th.e House of Commons stated * "That your petitionets are of oplnion that a medical council or central authority of some kind might be instituted with advantage to the public, in order to establish and enforce education and examinations of equal value as a foundation for reciprodty of practice in the three kingdoms. They believe that a council nominated by the Crown, not exceeding five or seven in number, including two non- medical members, might usefuly regulate the course of A education so as to secure the harmonious co-operation and efficiency of the several schools and licensin bhodies. The more immediate connexion with the State thus established would create an interest on the part of Government in the affairs of the profession, would insure the personal competency and responsibility of the council, and raise the profession in the estimation of the public." He trusted, therefore, that the Honse would hear no more of the injustice and degradation endeavoured to be heaped upon these corporations by means of a council nominated by the Crown. (Hear, hear.) He now came to what was called the " one portal system." 1For whom, he asked, were they legislating ? For tho people of England, and not for the rich merely. The rich had it in their power by means of their guineas to summon to their bedsides in time of illness Sir BenJamin This or That; butthe House had to take care that the generalpractitoners, who were charged withthe care of the poor, were not incompetent. In his Bil security was iaken that the name of no man not qualified in the opinion of a competent authority should be on the register When a man was on the register, the corporations and uni versities would then compete together to induce himito goto one or the other. They would erant titular distinctions, and the public would of course form their own opinion as to the comparative value of these particular distinctions. The Edinburgh CoUege of Physicians made the followin statement with reference to the proposal to abolish all the existing examining boards and to set up in their places one chosen jointly by the universities and the incorporations:- " Although some of these bodies have undoubtedy faithfully discharged their duties others have been most remiss, and, from the obviousdifflcultyof preferring oneto another, it seems better to establish one common portal through which the profession must be entered. While men continue to be actuated, as they at present are, by honourable ambition, and while the competition in our profession remains as it is, there is little fear of this engendering a dead level in medical acquirement; all will, indeed, enter by one portal, but most wiUl seek the higher honours which universitiesandcolleges wil bestow. There has been no want hitherto of a strenuous competition for the mere honorary distinctions in the profession, and this is not likely to be arrested by the BilL" Mr.Fergusson, the eminent surgeon, expressed the foUowing opinion in a letter to a friend with regard to his (Lord Eleho's) Bill :- " In so far as I am myself concerned, I have no objection thatmypreferencetoLordElcho'sBillshould beknown. Ihave for nearny 30 years advocated a main feature in thatBill-the one portal system. There is in my opinion no single feature in what is called medical reform of greater importance than this. In other respects there seems a simplicity of arran&ement in Lord Elcho's BiU which induces me to look Ear more favourably upon it than that of Mr. Headlam." The views entertained on the subject of the one portal system by the Edinburgh CoUege of Pbysicians and by Mr. Fergusson were strongly advocated 30) years ago by Dr. Thomson, the celebrated professor of medicine in the Universit of Edinburgh. Dr. Thomson, in his Life of Dr. CuUen, thus expresses his opinion:- " If it be desirable, for the interests of society, that there should exist a separate class of medical praotitioners, under the title of physicians, the Legislature would surely confer a greater benefit on the public by fixing a course of preliminary and professional education. and providing for the strict examination of those who desire to be licensed to practice in this capacity, and then leaving them at liberty to exercise their profession when they please, than by indulging particular corporations in the exercise of a narrow and exclusive system of monopoly, the only conceivable operation of which is to engender arrogance and presumnption, and consequently ignorance and rashness, in the minds of those who are admitted wirhin its pale, and jealousy and rancour in those who ar- kept without it." Similar views were maintained by Dr. Carpenter, of the London University, in his Mhcatize on Physiology, published some 30 years ago. He (Lord Eleho) now came to the charge that he was endeavouring to carry out what was called ,a Scotch Job." He had been charged with jobbery because he had advocated the 25-inch scale for the Scotch survey, and now, because he was anxious to destroy monopoly and to benefit the publie, he was accused of being engaged in a Scotch job. He believed that his proposal would bh advantageous to Scotland, but others would be equal gainers, as, for instance, the London University and University College, He must say, however, that he had had little commnnication with the Scotch Universities with reference to his measure, which he had broughtforward simply for public interests. It had been further said that the greatest unanimity prevailed among the medical profession on this subject, and that he (Lord Elcho) was merely throwing down an apple of discord. By some-hocus pocus the names of two hon. gentlemen opposite, the hen, member for the University of Oxford (Sir W.Ueathcote), and the right hon. member for Dublin University (lMr. Napier), who had last year fought the httle of the universities against the monopolists, ap. ef ared t'is year on the back of the Bil introduced by tBE Lon. and leatned member for Newcastle-on-Tyne. He gave that hon. and learned gentleman full credit for thos diplomatic tact which had led him to get the names of those. two hon. members placed upon the back of his BilL Lestyear the anmues of the hon. member for Ayr (Mr. Craufurd) and the hon. member for Lsitrim *Mr. Brys apteared upon the hon. gentleman'sBill, and it might natura ylave, been supposed that when the hon. member for Newcastleon-Tyne introduced this session anotber measure of medicali reforu, he wou.d have consulted the hon. gentlemen whopreviously backed him, and would again have placed theirnames upon the BilL His hon. and learned friend (Mr. Headlam), however, had not zaid a word on the subject toone of these gentlemen, but went over to the enemy, audf enticed from their ranks-by what bribe he (Lord Elcho>. knew not-the two hen. gentlemen opposite whoso name&. now appeared upon the back of his Bill. This seemedrather sharp practice, and consequently he (Lord Elcho) asked the hen. members for Air and Leitrim (Mr. Craufurj4 and Mr. Brady) to allow their names to be placed upon the Bill which he introduced. They unhesitatingly consented, and he obtained leave to bring in the MedicaL Profession No. 2 Bill. The next day he met the hon. member for Leitrim (Mr. Brady), who requested him, as a personal favour, to take his name off the Bill, statingZ that, from, pecuiar circcmstanc connected with his po.ition in Ireand, he did not wish to meddle any more with medicall reform. ("Hear," and a laugh.) He (Lord Elcho) c-. ceded to the hon. gentleman's request, but the consequences was, that he had to get the order for the Bill discharged, an to obtain leave to introduce the Medical ProfeEsion No. 3 Bill, which stood next upon the orders of the day. He, wishe to say a few words with reference to a documentr which had been circulated amnong hon. members, and which, denounced him for disturbing the unanimity of the medical, profession on this subject. That paper was written by a. member of the College of Physicians of London, and ho. doubted whether the oldest member of the House had everknown so extraordinary a production addressed to members. of Farliament. The paper was headed, "Remarks on Mr. Headlam's 'Medical Profession Bill' aud Lord Eleho's opposition." The first sentence ran thus6- "Surprise not uinmixed with indignation is tho generala feeling of the medical profession of the three kingdoms onm finding that Lord Elcho, as the advocate of the Scotch Universities, should have come forward to oppose the Medical Bill which was read a first time last Wednesday by 31r. Headlam." The Bill was not his (Lord Elcho's) Bill, nor was it the Bill of the Scotch Universities, but it was the Bil of a selecti committee, whose names afforded a sufficient guarantee thafSno "job" could be contemplated. He did not know whetherthe writer of this paper spoke in the name of the CoUege of Physicians, but at all events he belongzed to their body, and. ho proceeded to say:_ '1t is scarcely likely that any select committee of the* Honse of Commons should be in a position to comprehenc6 the complex bearings of this difficult subject, still less t;>. amend a decision arrived at with so much knowledge and so" much care." There was a compliment to the mental and judicial qualifications of committees of the House of Commons l The cream. of this document was, however, contained in its concluding: eentence : '- The whole profession, therefore, are determined to regulate the laws by which they are to be governed, and they aredecided not to allow any member of the House, however popular he may be, to come forward, partially instructed, and biassed, as it would seem, by a small and mercenary interest, to interfere with what they believe to be wise,. just, and prudent legislation." (Laughter.) Such a declaration emanating from the College, of Ph3sicians,expressingtheirdeterninationnot to allow` any member of the House of Commons to interfere with. what they in their wisdom conceived to be " wise, just, and prudent legislation," was really so alarming that hefelt some. esitation in inviting the House to attempt to deal with. this question. If they did so, they might have Dr.Mayo, atthe head of the College of Physicians, marching down to. the House ef Commons and ordering that " bauble" (pointing to the mace upon the table) to be taken away. ("Hear,' and laughter.) He (Lord Elcho) thou ht that smnce the, memorable declaration of the Grand Ionarque, "L'1tat; c'est moi," this production of the College of Physicians had; not been surpassed. (A laugh.) He (Lord Elcho) mustdeny, however, that the unanimity which was alleged tco prevail among members of the medical profession with respect to this uestion reay eh isted. The Medical pf ssoiation of EdiuDurgh, the Universities, the London University, and many of the corporations, were dissatisfied with, the Bill of the hon. memberforNewcastle-on-Tyne, aud he. (Lord Blcho) thought, therefore, there was no chance of its, becoming law. The hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Headlam) would doubtless lay great stress upon the petitions. in favour of his measure, but he (Lord Elcho) contended that they ought to have no weight, and he would tell theHouse why. He foand in the oediccl Journar4 the organ. of the British Medical Association, a report of a meeting, at vhich it was resolved that petitions should be' forwarded to Parliament in favour of Er. Headlam's Bill, and the following recommendation was given on the subject- "It is trusted that each member will write out and sign. a petition, and at once forward it to a member of the House' of Commons. The number of petitions is greatly mrore itanportant than the number of signatures to a single petition; therefore no time should be wasted in endeavouringtoobtain numerously signed petitions." (Laughter.) "Numerously signed petitions" meant, or course, numerous petitions each signed by an individaal. ("Hear," and a laugh.)! e believed he might state that, although among the deputation who waited upon Lordi Palmerston on this subject the delegates of the Medical Association of Great Britain were mentioned, the committee of that association had not authorized any member of their body to attend. Among the deputation were also delegates. from the College of Surgeons of London, but the next daya letter appeared in The Timet, signed by a member of the' College of Surgeons, who said that the gentlemen who pro° fessed to represent the College of Surgeons in the deputation had no more right to speak in the name of the 12,000 surgeons of England than would any three members of that House be entitled to go to the. Government as representatives of the House of Comons. He (Lord Elcho) maintained, then, that the una nimity which was alleged to prevail among the urofessioa did not in reality exist. Indeed the interests of the universities and of the governing bodies were so discordant that it; was impossible to establish anything like unanimity. He, hoped, therefore, that the House, instead of assenting tithe Bill of the hon. member for Newcastle-upon.Tyne would, adopt the Bill drawn up by the committee to whom they had referred the considerajion of the subject. It was absurdl to endeavour to obtain the consent of all the various bodies whose interests would be affected by such a measure-, If Parliament had waited until the consent of the legal profession had been obtained to improvements of the law. what efficient legal reforms could have been effcIted? If they had waited for the consent of the owners of rotten. boroughs when would the measures of Parliaentrp Reform have been carried? If they had waiteL for the consent of the farmers, and had been influenced by their petitions, when would free trade in corn have been established ? (Hear, hear.) He called upon the, House, then, to act with justice in this case, regardless of the profession. He was aware of the Quixotic nature of' the enterprise he had undertaken in endeavouring to induce' the House to oppose an organized agitation which extended, throughout tho three kingdoms. He knew what inflaence' mustnecessarily be exercised bymen of intellgent and highly cultivated minds, whose profession it was to heal the sick. tc' relieve the suffering, and to smooth the pillow of the dying. Their mission was indeed high, and no one could wonder a- their influence. It must be remembered, however, that physicians were but men, and that the House was now called upon to deal with men not in their individual but in theircorporate capacity. (Hear, hear.) If hon. gentlemen, setting aside allthe influence of private feehngsand of personal predilection, would view this question dispassionatelyand upon itS merits alone he had little fear of the result, and, he confidently anticipated that they wvould reject the, monopolizing Bill of the corporations and would substitute. in itS place the Bill of the select committee. (Loud1. Mr. NA PIER supported the Bill of the hon. and learned, gentleman (Air. Hieadlam), which was in entire accordausew with his own deliberate convictions. The noble lord had. asked why the medical profession should not be treated in. the same munner as the legal profession. He would showthe noble lord that he was endeavouring to place the medical profession upon a similar footing with his own profession_ In the case of the law university education was preparatory, and the Inns of Court stood in the same relation to the legal profession as the College of Surgeons did to the medical profeseion, occupying an intermediate position between university education and actual practice. He had not asked, that the Inns of Court might be destroyed, that their property might be taken away, and that they might. be placed under the control of a body nominated entirefly by the Crown ; hut on his proposalsa commission,. consisting of judges and lawyers, had been appointed, and. had unanimously advised that the universities should con. fine themselves to the preparatory and enlightened edaca.. tion necessary to fit men for aU prefessions, and should not. trouble themselves aboat any special preparations for prac. tice at the bar, hut that the Inns of Court should adopt one' uniform system, and admit no man to the bar until he had, andergone the ordeal of that system. Ee noun g was more valuable, or better fitted men to attain distion in any profession, and to render benefits to society, than that enlightened liberal education which was obtained in common in the universities. He considered that the great fault of legal, military, and medical education. was the maintenance of systems of narrow and exclusive, training, instead of providing a system of general enlightened education in schools and universities open to all, and then. having separate establishments for subsequent military, or legal, or medical instruction. Hs anxiety was that the House, in dealing with a question of this nature, should pro- eed upon enlghtened educational principles. (Hear, hear.)j The subJect now under consideration had been referred to a select comnittee of which he was a member, and the chie f, difficulty experienced by that committee vas in bringing into. harmony and co-operation the great bodies connected witha she medical profession which were at variance. He repretented bodies whose interests conflicted, for there were ivhe University of Dublin schools of medicine and surzery, and there were also the College of SuLrgeons and the Colege., of Physicians of Ireland. It was most important that aC . enlightened system of medical education should be estsblished, but that object could only be effected by concessionsg on beth sides. The bodies to which he had referred met iiz conference; they considered the measure which was pre- sented to them; and after various meetings and discussiong. they at length arrived at something like common agree. ment. That was the reason that hia name appeared on the. back of this Bill as representing the University of Dablin. The question was whether the principles embodied in this. mneasure were suchi as the HIouse ought to repudiate or to adop. Undoubtedly this Bill and that of the noble member- for Haddingtonshire (Lord Elcho) were utterly irrecondile. able. The noble lord proposed the establshment of a coun. oil, to be nominated by the Crown; the President of the Board of Health was to be chairman of that council; andu the whole medical body would thus be placed under the. direct influence of the Crown. The Bill of the hon. mem. ber for Newcastle (Mr. Headlam) proposed that the Genera Council of Medical Education should consist of rersiaP thosen by the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and the A&pothecaries Society of England, the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London. and Durham; the CoUeges of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh, the College of the Taculty of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, the 2?dedical Colleges, the Universit7 of Dublin, and the Queen' s University in Ireland; the Universities of Scotland (Glasfow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrew's) being grouped together. e considered that Ireland had just cazson to be mgroud of its medical and surgical schools, but who were the .Iersons who objected to the BiU of his hon. and learned nriend? Were they persons who had a ttained the highest .standard of medical education ? He did not wish to say -anxthing disre.pectful of Scotland, but although he adsnitted t at her universities had produced eminenlt men, it sn,ust be allowed that the; reputation of the Scotch degrees dIad been greatly depreciated. He knew that ilishmen who -were unable to pass for degrees in their own country went -over to Scotland in order to obtain theni. The Scotch Universities did not require degrees in arts before degrees in medi-cine were conferred, and he had himself met with a Scotch .*raduate who had never heard of lomuer. Now, tho BiU of his hon. and learned friend maintained the high grade of -the medical profession by requiring that before a man was lieenEed as a physician he should have taken a degree in 'arts and medicines in eome university. The Bill of his .oble sfrierd would, on the contrary, reduce all medical men -to the common level of the general practitioner, and would onl require the minimum of education. The moble lor maintained the right of the universities to grant licenses to practise, but he (Mr. Napier) thought the function of the universities should be to 'affoxd a sound preliminary and preparatory training, lebving to other bodies who were better competent to judge of qualifications for ptactice the duty of licensing. flis noble friend had referred to the University of LDndoa, s end the opinion of that university on this subject was ex.ireseed in these words :-" At the same tiule the Senate Ihave no desire to see conferred on this university any gene. xal or uncontrolled authority to grant licenses to its graduates to practise ; nor do they desire to secure special limmunities for the University of London in particular." "The University of London agreed, tben, that the right prinviple was that no monopolv should be given to the universities. What the noble lord wanted was that the Scotch universities should grant degrees in medicine without reqUiling previous degrees in arts. He (Mr. Napier) .u.ust say that be had met graduates in medicine fromi Scotland whose ignorance was quite astounding. *le contended they ought to take the very bighest standard <,f education, and the question was how that was to be pro*vidtd. They had in the Bill of his hon. and learned friend (4Ar. Headlam) provision made for a general council formed of the representatives of all the medical bodies, and that council had the power of insisting on a good general educatioDn, and a special education in medicine and surgery. If they wished to bave medical practitioners a more ealightened and better educated class they must call upon the aniversities to provide a hetter education. They must refer lIor their standard of general education to the best university, .and take their licensing power from the best professional body. Then the Bill of his hon. and learned friend (Ur. 3Readlam) made provision for a register which stated the qualifications conferred on practitioners in every instance, sond on wbich the publio could always rely for infonration of that kind. But it was said there were several corporations olpposed to the B3U of his hon. and learned friend, and mlong others the apothecaries of Ireland. With regard to She apothecaries of Ireland he (Ir. Napier) thought that uody had quite misunderstood the ciet wvhich the measure -was likely to have upon their interests, and he denied that it took away from them any privilege they already possessed. It was often said that assa body the members of the medical profession were not equally well educated with the bar nd the clurch. He thought the reason was that the eiducation of the medical practitioner had heretofore been nmuch too exclusive, and did not embrace that prelimuinary and good general education which it was one of the main objects of the Bill of his hon. and learned fuiend to enforce. tH1sar, hear.) That Bill, too, would secure what would be a manifest desideratum-namely, a common standard of Education for the medical profession of the whole united 3iL gdom. Where could they have that education so weU carried out as in the colleges enumerated in the BiU of his hon. and learned friend? The efficiency of that education vould be indicated and proved by the licence to practise -ihich would be given only after examinations conducted by the most competent men and controlled by the general council. With that strictly professional education the universities ought not to interfere, as it did not come within their functions. By the Bil of his hon. and learned friend the student intended for the medical profession, after an educsation at a university, would be taken up by the erminent n-en who attended the various hospitals and prepared by them to practise. The subsequent examninations would secure the requisite amount of competency, and there would also be the advantage of one uniform license. He trusted, therefore, the House would not give way to the suggestions n ade by the opponents of the Bill of his hon. and learned Ir-eid, enmanating, as those suggestions did, from quarters where at present nothing like an adequate amount of _ducation was given, and where the governing bodies .vranted to have tho power of giving degrees in medicine with degrees in arts, and, in fact, to dispose of an inferior articlo in the market. He thought the medical profession had not been fairly treated in this country. He oould not doubt that it ought to rank almost as high as the theological profession. for a man could be the rriest of his own family, but he could not be the Dhysician of his own family. It had, however, never been held in anything like equal esteem with the profession either of tht ology or of the law. He could not understand why that should be, seeing how intimately our moral and physical qualities were blended together, and how delicate and important in the lost degree were the functions which medical ;practitionera were constantly called on to discharge. Be- ibeving that the Bil of his hon. and learned friend would have the effect of iusuring to them a higher amount of general and professional education, and of elevating their In ofession generaUy, and knowing that it had the approval of his constituents, than whom there was no body of men more capable of appreciating its merits or of forming correct opinions on the subjects with which it dealt, he gave it his most cordial support. (Hear, hear.) AMr. COWPER said he thought it required all the ability of tho hon. and learned gentleman who had last addressed the House to justify the deprivation, contemplated in certain cases by the Bill of the hon. and learned member for New castle of the power of licensing medical practitioners now nested in the universities. Re hardly expected that tho lion. and learned gentleman, who represented a university in that House, would have taken the course he had on this occasion. Th1e Bill of the hon. and learned n-eiber for Newcastle took from the universities the llltr which they possessed by law of giving licenses to amcdical practitioners; and what was the equivalent they -Nere to receive in return '' By the Bill No. 3 they would i ceive what ho (Mr. Cowper) thought was a proper equivaI. int-namely, tbat they would have the power of nomina1ing the e.raminers v,ho wvere to examine in arts and the cik nces connected with medicine, while the medical corporations would nominate the examiners who were to examine with a view to practise. When the hon. and learned e.entleman (Mr. Napier) found fault with the education .iven at the universities he must have alluded to places "hivre the educationi given was of aas inferior description; 1 ut he would ask the hon. and learned gentleman to ]ook not mierely to those universities, but also to the uni-versities of London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, which were :netdical schools, and especially to that of Edinburgh, ss lese the theory of medicine was not merely taught, hit also the practice in the most eminent and superhItive degree. (Hear, hear.) The House had heard a great dpal said *bout unanimity during this debate. The subject of nsedical reform occupied a singular position with regard 1-, the question of ullanimity. WVhile they had, on the one I aidl, body against l,ody, reformer against reformer, and lIe moat conilicting views to take inito consideration, every on1:e who came forward to legislate on the subject nIvays betan by stating that he haL succeeded in attainil g unanillmity. The hon. and learned member (Hr. JI d-lan1) stated when he sought to introduce his Billof last ear that it had received theunaniiuous . ssent of the general i ody of the mnedical profession; but vhen the House went 'wso commBnuitteo upou it no less than 51 aienudmzients were su¢gestedto the measure so unanimiously recommended, and, i.,eed, the opposition to the Bill from every (quarter of the lluute was so manifest that the hon. and learned member I',urnd it out of the question toattempttocarry the measure lfurther, aud he took the very wise course of anreeing to a -ne gestion to refer it to a select committee. WVhen it was referred to a select committee there was really unanimity, I ecause the only division of importance that arose was on :. umotion as to the constitution of the council, which was a arriei by a majority of 8 to 2. As to the constitution of the council he (Air. Cowper) would mnuch rather see the reprez. ntative principle adopted- but be still thought the kifx -nco of the Crown ought to be felt in that body ; and if the enimination of the Crown was not to be recognized there nibht to be a provision by which the decrees and resolutions a f that council should not come into effrct unless they had ihie approval of Her Mbjesty by the advice of the Privy ('ounciL By that means the responsibility in the council would be divided between the advisers of the Crown and tbe representative principle. The question, however, now hbefore the House was not the constitution of the council. That was. a matter of detail which n:ight be settled in a variety of ways. The -real ,rinciple of the Bill of the hon. and learned gentle*man was that it decided who was to be hereafter a reaUy gusalfied practitioner, and how the requisite amount of qualification was to be keDt up. Those were matters of great importance to every individual in this country who at.ight require to have recourse to a legally qualified practitioner. He should be sorry to interfere with a class of practitioners to whom reference had been umade by the hon. aetnber for Finsbury (HMr. Duncombe), or to throw any .bindrance which night be uncalled-for by the interests of -lhe public in the way of quacks ; but he contended that the -public ought to have every facility afforded them for ascertaining which of those quacks had had a d roper medical education, and *which of thenm had mot. (Hear, hear.) One great defect under tho ,,resent system was the want of proper qualification among a large numnber of persons who were yet held to be qualified by law. Several hon. gentlemen had assumed that the preeent state of the law in respect to qualification was all That could he required, but he, on the contrary, believed it es-as very imperfect, and that the Bill of the hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Headlam), instead of providing au 4adequate remedy, rather aggravated the evil than otherwise. l:e should have been ready to support the biU if he could -bave done so, but believing that its effect would be to lower instead of raising the standard of qualification, he should be .compelled to vote against the second reading. [The right ton. gentlemau was proceeding to point out in detail what le considered the dofects of the Bill of Mir. Hleadlam, bht ,the impatience of the House for a division was such that he -weas obliged to dealst.] Adverting to the repeated cries of Divide," the right hon. gentleman said if he were to leave -cM speaking someo other member would probably claim to 'isserciso his right to he heard, and he did not see what they 'would gain by his resuming his seat.

'[ME SCOTCii DrEEB FORESTS.-Tho reports from the deer forests are even more favourable than the accounts we are able to supply as to the moors. Last winter was by no means severe, and, tho breeding season being excellent, the herds have thriven extremely well. As one correspondent observes, " there never was a better sward of grass among the mountains at such an early period of the year. The deer, therefore, must soon be as fat as pigs." In the DaLke of Richmond's forests of Glenfiddich and Blackwater, says a correspondent, " the deer were never more promising for a good season. Tley are showing fine heads and cleaning off the old hair very fast. The graFs is very good, and if the fine weather continue they should be in excellent condition by the middle of August. The early favwns look stron " Anothercorrespondent, writing of the sameforest, says, " ahe young fawns are so thriving and so far forward that they are runring in front of the herds-leading the van." A correspondent, writing of the Mortlach shootings, says, "Theplan. tations in that district appear pretty well stocked with roe deer." AStrathavon correspondentsays "TheGlenavonforest, which lies between Tomintoul and the Cairngorm range this year abounds with deer. It is, in fact, covered with both stags and hinds, with few if any barren hinds to be seen. The stags are fast getting into good condition, and beginning to take to the high grounds. I have no doubt but by the time Lord H. Benitinck visits his shootinquarters he will find his forest all that he could wish." X correspondent, writing from Dathil, with reference to the shootings occupied by the sportsmen who reside at Carrbridge, says, " They have a large park of the forest enclosed, where there are a great number of roe deer in first-rate condition, and some red deer have found their way into it. Wo expect there will soon be a stock of both in the park. Present prospects promise good sport." Equally gratifying accounts reach us from Rlossshire. A gentleman having frequent opportunitiesof learning the state of the leading forests west of LIverness towards Strathglass and Glen. Urquhart, says, " The deer are in excellent condition.

ELECTION COMMITTEES. CAMRR irnia At the sitting of the committee yesterday morning one of its members, the Marquis of Blandford, was absent, in consequence of the death of his father, the Dake of Marlborough. After some discussion among the learned counsel on either side and the committee with regard to the proper course to be pursued under these circumstances, the committee adjourned for an hour, in order to make a report to the House and receive instructions as to its future proceedings. At about a quarter after 1 the committee resumed, and The CnAmiRAN announced that the House had given him leave to dispense with the attendance of the Marquis of Blandford. The learned counsel for the petitioner then proceeded with the cases of non-residence. The first case was that of the Rev. G. Maddison. After hearing evidence, The Co srxll=rrs held that the allegation of non-residence had not been proved, and the vote was retained. Two other votes were struck out. Mr. PFoAV}' then applied for leave to reopen Maddison's case, hut The COasaIrraEm refused to accede to the application. The vote of John Gaylor was also struck out, leaving tbe petitioner in a majority of one, and the committee adjourned. MAYO (COUNTY). The examination ofMr. M'Laughlin was resumed at the sitting of the comruittee. He said that on Sunday, the 22d of 31arch, Father Ryan from the altar of his chapel said that the little baronet (meaning Sir R. O'Donnell) was out on his canvass, and he hr ped the parishioners wonld hunt him with their dogs, and shut their doora in his face. On Suanday, the 29th of March, he was again at mass at the chapel at Rilmena, when Father Ryan said the curse of God would come on any one who voted against his country and for Higgins. He also said that he would not give the rites of the church to any one who so voted; that he would neither give them confession nor the sacrament, but they should go to the bishop. He added that it was the bishop's own parish, and the bishop expected them to do their duty. e further desired that the parishioners generally would keep their eyes on the freeholders, and said that he would brand the voters of Higgins, and he hoped the congregation would not speak to them. On the following Sunday, the 5th of April, the day before the pollieg, Father Ryan asked the congregation whether the Derby priest [i. e., one of the Plymouth brethren) had given mass to Higgins's voters who had been taken to Newport, and caled upon the wives and daughters of those voters to go and bring them back. After the service a number of the congregation, between 100 and 200, went away svith Ryan to Newport. During the polling he was at West Port and at Castlebar. Father Ryan was at Castlebar; he stood at the booth and shook his hand at Higgins's voters as they went up to pOl, and called tbem "traitors." On the Sunday after the election Father Ryan desired those black sheep who had voted for Higgins not to dare to give him any Eastor dues. (Laughter.) Oa the folowing Sunday ho mentioned the name of a voter who had supported Higgins, and sd he shotuld not attend that mass-house. On Sunday, June 14, he said also in the chapel that there were three spies, orjackdaws, watching him, and taking down everything he said, and that some one had been served with a Speaker's warrant to give evidence against him. He cautioned the people against committing perjury, adding that he was afraid any one going such a distance would not stop at an oath; but he was outt of their power, having said nothing of any consequence before the election. On cross-examination the witness said he had gone to the chapel on every Sunday from the 15th of March until the time of his leaving Ireland. He rented land from Mr. Jennings. He plumped for Higgins. He had made notes of what he had heard at the chapel. Sir R. O'Donnell. Lord Sligo, and the Earl of Lucan were among the principal landowners in the neighbourhood of Kilmena. The Law Life Company also owned land there. Their tenantry voted for Higgins and Palmer. Sir R. O'Donnell was an active supporter of Higgins. Mir. Andrew Montgomery, a stipendiary magistrate, who had been stationed at Castlebar during the election, said that on Thursday, the 2d of April, he saw a priest named Curly, with a book in his hand, walking in procession at the head of a large number of people opposite Moore and Palmer's committee-rooms. Witness was asked to grant a warrant against Curly, but he refused, fearing to increase the excitement of the people. Father Ryan called Higgins's voters " traitors" as they were going to the poll. Hliggins's voters were obliged to have an escort. He vas sent to Castlebar by the Government. The high sheriff went to Westport with an escort to fetch some voters who were detained in a house. John Gannon, a Roman Catholic freeholder, living near Castlebar, stated that the Rev. Mr. Cahill, the priest of his parish, had canvassed him for Moore and Palmer. Witness said he would follow his landlord. Father Cahill said he had the interest of his landlord. Witness afterwards went to Castlebar to ascortain what side his landlord took, and stayed) at Pat Barrett's publichouse. While at Castlebar he saw Father Green and other priests. One day, when he refused to vote for Moore and Palmer, and said he should vote for Higgins, Father Cahill and another priest named Hosty told him that if he did they would " call him out at the four chapels and announce him at the altars of God." He told them that if they took away his character in that way he would "take an action against them." Father CahiU said that if witnes voted forHiggins he would make an example of him. Casy and Feeny were present at the time. Casy was drunk, and witness told him so. There was another man present-a fishwoman. (Langhter.) She was well able to scold, and she began to abuse him. He was taken to the Court-house by the police, and he plumped for Higgins, and was then escorted home. 'rhe day after the election as he was going to pay his rent he met Cahill and another priest, Father Hosty, and Cahill told him that he had the devil in his countenance. He had not been to mass since the election. He sent his Easter offering, 2s. 6d., to Father Cahill, but it was sent back to him. Cross-examined.-Before the election he was a regular attendant at mass. Pather Cahill had not spoken to him on account of his treatment of his wife. He had quarreUed with his father-in-law about a "fortune " which his fatherin-law had promised him (laughter), and he had separated from his wife, and the priest reconciled them. Father CahiU never threatened to speak to him from the altar on account of the life he was leading-he had no occasion, and (to the learned counsel) " You know it as well as I do." (Laughter.) The fishwoman who scoldedahimnwas not out of her senses. How could she be inad if she sold fish? (Laughter.) Was he frightened at what the priest said to him ? Faith! if ho was he'd be dead by this time. (Laughter.) Mr. Sharkie, who had rcted as deputy-sheriff for the barony of Kilmaine during the election, stated that on Sunday, the 5th of April, he attended mass at Castlebar, when the officiating priest, Father CahiUl, addressed the people in reference to the election, and said that in the esti.nation of the] bishops and clergy Colonel EHiggins had been found wanting, and the interest of God and of religion required them to vote for Aoore and Palmer. As he was goieg to Ballinrobe he met people who attempted to stop him, but bis driver told them be had no interest in the election, and they then let him pass on. The witness then deFcribedavarious cases of interference with voters which he bad seen during his stay at the hotel engaged by iloore and Palmer in BaUinrobe. The priests, he continued, took a very active part in the election in favour of Moore and Palmer, and he was obliged to remonstrate with several of tbemn. Application had been made to him to issue a warrant against Conway. He did not think he had jurisdiction to arrest Conway, but he sent for him and told him he would give him until the following morning to answer the charges brought against him. He did not aft.rwards see rConwa at Ballinrobe. On theAmlodayheh bad consulted with the magiitrate about taking Conway into custody. Conway had entered into conversation with him, and told him that Higgins had brought all this upon hi nself, and he would have had no trouble if he had waited on the archbishop before the election. Witness adjourned the poll between 1 and 2 on the Tuesday, in consequence of the affidavit of a voter. Two previous applications for adjournment had been niade to him. On the Wednesday after the close of the poll he drovethrougha mob which was beingaddressed byMx. AMoore, accompanied by an escort. Mr. Moore pointed to him and said something which he could not hear. The mob then commenced hooting and yeling and threatening him. He said as he passed, " Mr. Moore. I bear the poll-books, and I call on you, in the name of Her Majesty, to protect me." Mr. Aloore said lie hoped he would not tamper with the pollbooks. Witness then drove on, and the mob threwv stones after him. Cross-examined.-Hfe was not connected in any way with the county Mayo. He was taken there by the High Sheriff, Captain Higgins, the Colonel's fatner. He wvas a great friend of Colonel Eliggins. The supporters of Colonel Higgins were on the bench, by the side of the High Sheriff, at the nomination. He put up at Moore and Palmer's hotel because he was driven there. (The witness, at the request of the learned counsel, then read a memuorandum of the speech he had made to the people at the opening of the poll, requesting thom to behave in an orderly and proper manner during the election.] He was sorry that the speech did not produce the effect he had anticipated. On the Tuesday night the waiter came to him while he was in bed at the hotel, and told hian that the agent of Moore and Palmer required him to leave the house immediately. He said to the waiter, " TeU the agent to go about his business." Witness then opened his window and called in some policemen, with whom eame a stipendiary magistrate, and iwo police men remained in the hotel to guard him the rest of the night. Witness was a Roman Catholic. At the close of this witness's examination the committee adjourned until this day. WAREHAM. At the conclusion of the scrutiny, the result of which was a majority of one for Mr. Calcraft, the committee entered into the question of agency. Mr. Caloraft was examined, in order to ascertain whether Mr. Pike, a merchant of the borough, who was alleged to have been guilty of acts of bribery and intimidation, had been anthorized to act as his agent; and he denied that Mr. Pike had any authority to act in that capacity. The comimittee got up by Mr. Pike was not, he said, his committee. The learned counsel on either side having addressed the committee upon the evidence The committee adjourned, before they had come to a decision, until this day. ROCHDALE. The committeo reassembled yesterday morning, all its members being present. M1r. MoNE informed the committee thatsincethe adjournmrent on Tuesday afternoon he and his learned friend had considered the resolutions to which the committee had come, especially within the last two days. The effemct of those dscisions was to exclude a great deal of evidence with which they were prepared, and they had therefore determined to close their case. Mr. VAUGHrAN then proceeded to sum up the case for the petitioners. Having dwelt upon the importance of this case to the public interests, and more especially to the borough of Rochdale, into the elections for which corruption had for the first time been introduced, the learned counsel zqfd*Ad comraented upon the most material part3 of the tvIdence, both as to bribery and agency, upon which he submitted that the committee must dcide that the peti,ioners' case was made out, that this election had been gained by bibery and corruption, and that, therefore, the sIttDig member was not duly elected. At the conclusion of Mr. Vaughan's address the room was c7eared, and the committee consulted for about 35 minutes. On the readmission of the parties, The CHAIRMAN stated that the committee had agreed to the foUowing resolutions .- "*rhat Sir Atexander Ramnsy is duly eleoted to sit In this present Parliament. " The committee are also of opinion that there has beem no proof o: the agency of the partles charged with bribery." When this decision was announced there was an attempt at applause, but it was immediately suppressed,

THE PALACE OF ESTAINSTEBR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Public attention having by a recent discussion in Parliament been directed to the condition of the iron roofs and the stone of the New Palace at Westminster, the fol;owing information respecting them may not be unacceptable to your readers, and may serve to remove any misapprehension that may exist on the subject. Metal roofs were not contemplated in the original desiuzn. They were resorted to upon the adoption by the Government of Dr. Reid's plans for warming, ventilating, &c., by which they were required to contain, as they now d s the main smoke flues of the building, and therefore it tecame necessary that they should be constracte1 entirely of fireproof materials. A coating of zinc in preference to paint for the external plates was adopted, upon the strongest testimonials from the French Government and other sources as to its long and successful use in France, where it still continues to be employed extensively, particularly in the dockyards of that conntry. Since its adoption at the New Palace at Westminster it has also been extensively used both inpublic and private works in this country, and is still being used by the Government in our own dockyards. Experience, however, has proved that it is not capable of offering a long resistance to the deleterious effects of a smoky and impure atmosphere, and the roofs of the New Palace at Westminster have consequently become partially covered with an oxide of iron, or rust. As re gards their stability and weatber-proof qualities, however, they are none the vworse on that account. No difficalty, moreover, exists in resisting allJfurther oxidation, by coveriihg them with one of the anti-oxide compositions now in use, which may be done at a very moderate cost. Several of these compositions have been in conrse of trial in -arions parts of the roofs for some tine past, and I have reason to believe that I have discovered one that may be said to be almost imperishable. The choice of the stone adopted was the result of the labours of a commission consisting of two of the most eminent geologists of the day, an intelligent mason, ani the architect, who in the year 1838 visited every quarry and locality in the kingdom likely to furnish building stone. The stone at Anston, in Yorkshire, was selected and adopted by the Government, and every precaution has been taken to obtain a supply from the best beds of it. Upon the whole, it bas turned out to be at least as good as any stone hitherta employed in London; portions of it, in particular situa. lions, and under peculiar conditions, have doubtless yielded to the deleterious effects of a London atmosphere, but the proportion of the parts affected to those which are perfectly sound is infinitesimally small, and it is remarkable that the decomposition is alnmost exclusively confined to the plain faces, the moulded and carved portions of the work being generally as sharp and perfect as when first executed. To say, therefore, as has been recklessly asserted, that tbe stone is perishing in all directions, conveys a most unfair and exaggerated impression relative to its accurate condition. Various economical means, however, are available for arresting all further decom position of the parts affected, and experiments have been in course of trialfor years, with a view to determine upon the most effectual and unobjection. able process to be employed, and it is hoped, therefore, that ere long all further decomposition wiU be successfally arrested. * I am, Sir, your obedient servant. CHARLES BA1UFyv I Qld Palaewyard, June 30,
THE DIVORCE BILL. PROTESTS. Dissentient,- 1. Because the effect of rejecting this amnendment will be to confine the dissolution of marriage upon the adultery of the husband to the four cases stated in the Bill, which we consider to be not only inexpedient, but, as contrasted with the relief upon the adultery of the wife, partial and 2. Because, as the clause is framed, although the husband shouldi be living in the most open and notorious adultery, ani should even bring his mistress into the family residence, i bulting the wife by her presence, and should endeavour by ill usage to compel her to submit to this disgrace, such a case tv uld not coine within its provisions. 3. Because the adultery of the husband, accompanied w th the commission of the greatest crimes, and even the anist infamous vices, would not entitle the wife to relief uuder this clause. 4. Because the adultery of the husband, although coupled with his condemnation to penal servitude, even for life, and the consequent degradation and misery of the wife wou)ld not, under the provisions of this Bill, enable her to' obtain a dissolution of the marriage. 5. Because many other cases of similar injustice and hardship are excluded from relief under this clause. 6. Because to allow a divorce for the adultery of the wife, and to refuse it in these and other cases of adultery by the husband, coupled with acts of deep injury inflicted upon the wife, is manifestly unjust. 7. Because, although the adultery of the wife may lead to the imposing a spurious offspring on the husband, and entitle him to a dvorce for a reason which would not apply to the case of adultery by the huisband, other circumstances may, and frequently do, occur in connexion with the adultery of the husband, giving the wife an equal claim to this remedy. 8. Because no distinction is mnade in Scripture between the case of the man and of the woman in the commission of adultery. The sin is the same in both-both are included under the same prohibition. 9. Because the whole tendency and spirit of the Christian religion is manifestly calculated to raise women to equal rights and equal responsibilities with men. " It has," in the w tords of an eminent writer on general law (Chief Justice Stery) "1elevated womarn to the rank and dignity of an equal, instead of being an humble companion or a devoted slave of her husband;" and accordingly we find that as Christianity extended itself, and its influence was brought to bear upon social and civil affairs, so the condition of woman was improved, and her rights to protection and redress were acknowledged. With respect to marriage and divorce the rule of the Roman Catholic Church applies to both sexes equally, while all Protestant Legislatures (except our own), in declaring that marriage may be dissolved for the cause of adultery, havo accorded to the wife the same rights and remedies as to the husband. 10. Because by our ecclesiastical law (the only law at present applicable to this subject), the samo judgment is pro. nounced in the case of adultery, whetherthe crimo be committed by the husband or wife. And there appears to us no reason why, in extending the remedy, the principle slould be changed. 11. Because as to the objection that the extension of the law to cases of adultery by the husband will give occasion to a reat numnber of suits for divorce, we think such apprehension is altogether groundless. The proceedings can originate only with the wife, and she has, both as to feeling and interest, so much at stake, so much to relinguish which must be most dear to her, that we think there is little fear of her resorting to this remedy, except in extreme cases, and after all hope of amendment has ceased. 12. Because by the law of Scotland the adultery of the husband with respect to divorce is placed on the same footing with the adultery of the wife. This law is found to be attended with no inconvenience. The evidence on the sub. ject is above all exception, and we deem it most desirable that laws which so deeply affect the social and moral condition of the people sbould, in contiguous parts of the same empire, be in accordance with each other. HUTCHINSON. HABR.RINGTON. LYNDFIURST. TALBOT DE MALARIDE. BE1AIORE. Dissentient,- 1. Because the contract of marriage is the most solemn engagement into which a man can enter, and in which he promises to love, comfort, and honour the woman, and keep her under all circumstances of sickness or of health, and adhere to her as long as they shall both live. 2. Because the purposes of this engagement, as deduced from Scripture, are of the deepest interest andimportanceviz., for the birth of children to be brought up in tho love and fear of God, for a remedy against sin, and for mutual scciebv, help, and comfort, both in prosperity and adversity. 3. Because by wilful desertion not only is this sacred promise impiously violated, but all the purposes for which thiB ordinance of God was instituted are wholly frustrated. Even in the most ordinary contract the breach of it on the one side puts an end to the obligation on the otber, and we see no reason why a different rule should be applied to the contract of marriage, and more especially in a case destructive of the entire objects of the union. It appears to us to be contrary to all principle, and most unjust, that the husband sbould be permitted to set at naught au engagement followed, as it must be, by such consequences, and that the woman should continue to be bound by it. 4. Because we feel strongly the extreme cruelty of such conduct towards the deserted wife, in the utter disappointment of all her confident expectations of bappiness from the ronsed love, comfort, and society of her husband, and eaving herwithouthopeto the contemplation of a long, dreary, and desolatefuture, 5. Because divorce from this cause is justified as Scriptural by the highest ecclesiastical authorities. It is well known that at the Reformation the subject was anxiously and carefully considered by prelates and divines eminent for learning and piety, and that they came to the conclusion that wilful desertion was a scriptural ground for divorce. We find the names of Archbishop Cranmer, of the Bishops of London, Winchester, Ely, Exeter, and others; df Latimer, Parker, &c. ; of Peter Martyr, Martin Bucer, Beza, Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, &c., among those who maintained this opinion, and which was adopted by the whole body of Protestantson the continent of Europe. Accordingly, this has been the acknowledged doctrine of all their churches to the present day. We find the same doctrine expressly stated and adopted in the 8th Article on Divorce in the ReformatioeLegum c&dese,tcoarun, compiled under the authority of Henry VIIL and Edward VL, which body of laws, although it did not receive the confirmation of the Crown, in consequence of the earlyandunexpeced death of KingEdward,has always,as the Commissioners on the Law of Divorce, in theirreport, justly observe, been considered of great authority. We also find that at a more recent period a riaht rev. prelate, eminent for learning and talents (Cozens, Bishop of Durham), in his celebrated argument delivered in this House, in the case of Lord Roos, n.aintained the same opinion. His words are these:-" The prowise of constancy in the marriage ceremony does not extend to tolerating adultery or malicious desertion, which dissolve the marriage." 6. Because, by the law of Scotland, wilful desertion, as isi all the Protestant churches on the continent. is considered to be a Scriptural ground for divorce, and the law in this respect is regarded by all the first authorities in that country not only to be free from inconvenience, but as just and highly beneficial. We further deem it to be most desirable that upon such a subject as marriage and divorce, affecting as it does the whole social system, the sanie law should, as far as practicable, prevail in both parts of the kingdom, and the more so as continued experience has snown the great inconvenience occasioned by the difference and anomalies of the tswo systems. 7. Because, as to the objections to the proposed extension of this measure on the ground of its tendency to demoralize society, this is not only disproved by the example of Scotland, but a careful examination of thea state of society in Rloman Catholic cluntries will, we think, lead to the conclusion that the principle of the indissolubility of marriage is far less favourable to morality than the opposite doctrine, accompanied with a cautious exercise of the power of divorce in such extreme cases as those of adultery and malicious desertion. S. Because, as to what is urged with reference to the law of our ecclesiastical courts, -we answer that the object of the present Bill throughout is to amend that law, and to render it sore consistent with reason and justice; and, wi'th respect to the church of England, we will merely repeat what we find stated in the argument of the learned Proate to -which we have already referred-viz., that "We cannot Fee why tbey are to he styled the Church of England who join with the Council of Trent, rather than those who join with all the reformed cburches, and plead against the canon of the Church of Rome, which hath laid ananathema upon us if we do not agree with them."

SUPPLY OF GUANO.-Instructions were given by the Government in 1844, 1852, and 18.53 to naval officers on various foreign stations, directing them to take everv opportunity of ascertaining wbere any large suipplies of gnano existed, or were likely to he discovered. The reports of the naval officers in reply have just been published in the form of a Parliamentary paper. The localities wbence guano tas hitherto been imported are Peru and Bolivia, where the guano is ammoniacal, Chili, and Ichaboe, where it is " inter-iediate," and Saldanha Bay, Algoa Day, Patagonia, P.wssesion, and Bird's Island, and Australia (Sbarkls Bay) wTexo the guanoo are phosphatic. The value of gnano as manure is mnainly dependent upon its containing two snbstances, the phosphate of linme and compounds of ammonia, or animal matters the decomposition of wbich will generate that invaluable alkali. The amnmonia is of course, far snore, valuable than the phosphate of lime. The Kooria Moodia Islands, five in rumber, situate on tie south coast of Arabia, betwixt the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, are now rnpidly rising into importance as storehouses of guano under the manage. ment of Nlessrs. Ord, Hindson, and Hayes, to whom the exclusive right of esnorting any guano that may be found on three of the isles has been granted. MIr. IE. Osborne, the Secretary to the Admiralty, addressed a circul.r oni the .5th nlt, to the Commanders-in-Chief in the East Indies, the Paci6c, the south-east coast of America, the Cape, the west coast of Africa, and Australia, apprising those officers that the question of obtaining supplies of guano bad recently assumed greater importance than heretofore, and desiring themn to call the attention of their subordinate naval officers to the subject, acd to instruct them not to onmit any opportunity of searching for guano on any islands or places where it nmight be likely to be found. .IISII PROBATES AND LETTEBS oF ADnrN5-isTB.ATioN BILL-A Bill bas been brought in by 3ra Attorney-General for Ireland and hir.

THE FRIGIrTur, ACCIDEN? ON TH. NO1TR KIENT BAILWAY. )!esterday morning Thomas Perry, 29, enginedriver, and Edward Whiffen,stoker, in the service of the South-Easterm Pdilway Company, were brought up on remand before Mr. TRAiLL at the Greenwich Police-court, charged with *' neglect of their duty in driving an engine and train of passengers past the danger signal at the Lewisham station. on the North Kent Railway, whereby 11 persons were killed and several others seriously injured, in the parish of Lewis. ham." Mr. Rees, solicitor to the South-Eastern Railway Company, was present, Mr. Burgon attending for the prio Soners. The first witness called was Mr. John P. Knight, Superintendent of the South. Eastern Railway. He deposed,-I have control over aU stationmasters and outdoor officers in the employ of the company. The North Kent line is worked by two separate signals,-the semaphore and distance signals, and the telegraph, arms being used by day, and discs or lamps by night. I now produce a copy of the signals. The red light indicates " Danger-stop;" the green light " Cautioa -go slowly;" and the white light " All right-go on." The electric signals are used by the stationmasters, and the eemaphore signals are for the use of the drivers and guards and other outdoor servants. The person on duty at the Etation receives the telegraph signals, and communicates them to the guardThe person in charge of the train is not supposed to know of such signals being received. A copy of the rules of signals is given to every officer of the company, the 16th generdi rule requiring each person, to make himself fully acquainted with the regulations. By rule 15 the enginedriver is directed in all cases to keep a good look-out, and, before starting, to satisfy himself that tho proper signal has been given, which he receives from the guard, who hold out his arnL The 20th regulation requires the fireman to ride on the tender, and not on the engine; to 'keep the break at command, and to keep a good look-out on the line and train when not attending to his other duties. By rule 31 the enginedriver and fireman must pay strict attention to signals, even if unnecessary. By the 32d rule, if from fog or other cause the signals are not seen before entering any station, or passing any junction where signals are sitnateI the engine is to be immediately stopped. Rule 33 directs that the enginedriver shaU hava a zed light placed in the frontand at the end of the train. The 55th rule directs that when any driver sees tte red signal or any other signal to stop he is to bring bis engine to a standstiU close to the signal, and on no account to pass it. On the 21st of April last rules for anew code of electric signals were issued for that part of the North Kent line between London and Woolwioh a copy of which was sent to each stationmaster and exhibited in every signal-box. For the purpose of working these signals the line was divided into sections, whicS might contain three or four signal stations. The place where the accident happened is comprised in section No. 7, which comprises Lewisham 'unction and Lewisham station Lewlsham station and Blackheath, Blackheath and Anerstein junction, and Charlton. At each of these junctions and stations there is an electric telegraph instrument. At all places and stations there is a code,consisting of adifferaLt nunmber of beats from a gong or bell-the gong being used for a down and the bell for an up train. The sounds are easily distinguished. The syst-em is sanctioned by the Board of Trade, and was first used by the SouthEastern Railway Company. The directions for the signalling are as follows:-No. 5. Before an up-train leaves or as it passes a station the station in advaace is to receive notice by sounding a bell slowly and distinctly. Section 6 directs that the signal is to be acknowledged by the station in advance sounding a gong at the rear station; at the same time back stations are warned "to stop ai up," thereby blocking the line. Section 7 directs that, this signal being acknowledged, the train is to proceed. Rule o directs tbat, as soon as an up-train is clear of a station, the signal "All clear up" is to he sent to the station in the rear. The cede also states by this particular section that two beats on the bell are to be given to the station in advance. If the person in charge of the telegraph signal-for instance, at Blackheath and Lewisham-attends to the instructions mentioned in this code no train can leave Blackheath for Lewishain until Lewisham has signaUed to Black-heath that the last preceding train has passed lewisham. Having heard the evidence thatthe train of which the prisoners had charge had run into another train at the Lewisham station, I am satisfied there must have been somethirg wrong in the telegraphic communication between those stations. The train ran into had been brought up at the Lewisham station by the distance signal being at " Stop aU up," although it was not a station where the train ought to have stopped. A message having been sent, the person in charge of the instrument has no power to alter the poiltian of the needle without giving a signal, and the signal given at one station must necessarily show itself on the instrument at the other. The instrument does not record a message, but indicates what the message is for the time only. A person going into the signalbox at Lewisham would be able to see what the last msessage sent to Blackheath was, but not the time it was sent. The time at which miessages are sent is recorded in the book I now produce, which is the train signal.hook for the Lewisham station. I also produce the blackheath station-book, and that of the Lewisham junction. The Lewisham and the Blackheath booL-s record the time at which the signal is received and sent. The accuracy of these books depends upon the correctness of the signalman appointed for that peculiar purpose in making the signaL The books also record the arrival and departure of trains from each station. It is the duty of the stationmaster to report any omission or inattention to signals. In the Blackheath stationbook now produced I find an entry of the 9.15 train havmg been signalled back from Lewishata to Blackheath as " All clear" at 10.48. If that signal had been sent the Lewisbam hook ought to contain a record that it had been sent. On referring to the Lewisham book I find no such entry. I wws on the spot shortly after the accident; from the position of the break van on the third-class carriage I cannot say at what rate the engine rulming nto it was travelling. When the stationmaster is himself on the platform it is his duty to give the signal to the guard, it being his duty, before giving the signal, to satisfy hinmself from the electric signalman that the "l lU clear" signal bas been received f7om the station in advance. Both of the signalmen at the Blackheath and Lewisham stations have been in the company's employ several years. They are sober men, and I have'never had any complaints of them. By Mr. Burgon.-After the telegraphic signal is given the semaphore is used. Both signals are worked by one man. There ought to have been a signal sent from the Black-heath statson to Levnsham of the departure of the 9.30 train by two beats of the hel. Tbat signal would have to be givea as the train left. the station. When the Blackheath signalman saw the 9.30 train advancing towards the station it would not be his duty to make any signal. When he signalsthe train out of the station he ought to record the time. There is such an entry in the Blackheath -book-" 10.53."; According to the previous entry of 10.4S the signal "All clear" from Levisham of the 9.15 train had been received. The man at Blackheath woald keep the semaphore signal at " danger" until he received the signal " All clear" from Bewisham, and would then alter it to "All right." The 9.30 train was to stop at Blackheath, and all other stations; the 9.30 train would not start until the semaphore was " All rigbt,h but from the position of the semaphore it could not be seen at the station. Mr. TRAILL said on leaving Blackheath the prisoners were all correct; the question was, their conduct after leavin g the station. By Mr. Burgon.-The distance signals have been placed as an additional protection to the semaphore. The driver uses a discretion in passing the distance signal, if he sees the line beyond clear; but would not go beyond the semaphore under any circumstances. If at night, the driver would not be allowed to pass a yard beyond the distance signdl. Mr. TRAiLL here said it would be impossible for him to hear more evidence that day, as he had to attend at the Wcolwich Police-court. He should therefore adjourn the furtber hearing until the next day. MIr. Burgon again applied for bail to be taken for the prisoners'appearance, but Mr. TMAILL refused the application.

LONDON, THURSDAY, JULy 2, 17. In the House of Commons yesterday, Mr. HEArr,Ar moved the second reading of the Medical Profession (No. 1) Bil. The main feature of this Bill which distingaished it from Lord Elcho's with the same title (the next upon the orders of the day) was the institution of a General Council of Medical Education and ]Registration, to consist of persons chosen by the medical and surgical colleges of the united kingdom, certain medical societies, and the Universities, with six persons to be named by the Queen; the regulations of this council in resnect to examination of candidates and registration to be carried out by branch councils. Mr. CRAuFuRuD moved to defer the second reading for six months. He contended that this Bill aCrificed too much to the interests of the medical corporations, perpetuating an objectionable system; and that it was impossible that the proposed General Council could work satisfactorily. Lord ELCHO's Bill (which proposed to establish a Medical Council, to consist of the President of the General Board of Health and 12 members to be nominated by the CRowwforaterm)didnotsweepawaythecorporations, but provided that the giving a title to practise should not De confinedto these bodies, and that the candidates should be subject to approval by examiners nominated by the Medical Board; the framework of this Bill being similar in other respects to Mr. HMMAIIr's Bill. The debate which ensued turned chiefly upon the comparative merits of what were considered to be the principles of the two BiUls,-the one proposing a representative, the other a nominee council. Mr. H&DLWar's Bill was preferred by Lord BuBy, Mr. HArEnTa1, Mr. GRoGAw, Mr. NEArz, Mr. VAcE, and Mr. BBRscoz; Lord ELo's by Mr. EWART, Mr. BLAcx, and Mr. BLAKE; while Colonel Svxas and Mr. T. DuNco3mE opposed both Bills. Lord EonHo, after pointing out various anomalies under the existing law, which showed the necessity of some change, argued that the proper course was to take up the question in the position in which it was left by the select committee of 1856; whereas Mr. HEADiWsS Bill, with the exception of a slight alteration in the constitution of the council, was the same as the unamended Bil of last session, and he opposed it on the ground that it gave a practical monopoly to the medical corporations. He then defended his own Bill, which was, he said, the BilU of the select committee. The real principle in question he contended was whether or not a monopoly should be given to the corporations. the constitution of the council being a matter of detail, to be considered in a committee on the BilS Mr. NAPIsa, whose name was on the back of Mr. HEADLAies Bill, supported the motion for its second reading. His object, he said, was that the House should proceed upon enlightened educational principles, and the question was whether this Bil embodied such principles. Lord ELoHO'a Bill would place the whole medical body under the control of the C,towx, whereas this Bill gave to the Universities the educational power, as teachers ;the licensing autho'ity residing in the medical bodies, represented in the General CounciL The other Bill would not secure a sound and sufficient education for the profession. Mr. CowrPE, after briefly noticing some parts of Mlr. NAPSrU'S argument, adverted to the difficulty of leg,islating upon a subject on which there was such a conflict of opinions; for, although there had been allegations of unanimity, there was no real concurrence of sentiment in the profession. He preferred the Bill which had emanated from the select committee, and thought that the influence of the CRowa ought to be felt over the medical body; but the principle of the Bill was not the constitution of the council, which was a matter of detail; its real principle was as to what should be the legal qualification of medical practitioners, the standard of which was not improved. For this and other reasons, which he detailed amid symptoms of impatience, he could not assent to the second reading of the Bill. Mr. HEADLAX, in replying to objections, and stating the reasons why his Bill should be preferred to the other, complained that by Lord ELcHo's Bill the whole organization of the medical profession was destroyed, and that those clauses whereby the profession was placed under the arbitrary dominion of a council nominated by the Ciowiq, and presided over by the President of the Board of Health, had been proposed and introduced into the BiU in the committee by the chairman, Mr. COWPEa himself. Upon a division the second reading was carried by 225 to 78. The Bill was then read a second time, and Lord ELono withdrew his Bill. In the course of the debate Mr. DEASY, th chairman of the Cambridge Election Committee reported that the Marquis of BLANFORD had been absent from the committee on accotnt of the illne s of his father, whose death was jnst announced; anl, upon the motion of Mr. D"AY, the Marquis (now Duke of MARLanotouGo) was discharged from further attendance. The report of the committee on the Rochdale election waa brought up. The other orders were disposed of, and the House adjsurned about five minutes before 6 o'clock.
The Ottoman Empire may fairly be considered to have taken its place among civilized States when we find it adopting the newest fashions indiplomacy, and dismissing a Foreign Minister, just as Spain or. the United States might do. By the last mail from Constantinople we learn that M. BLONDEEL VAi ESSELEBtUCK, the Representative of Belgium, has received his passports, and has been informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Suniz PoRTE wiU hold no further relations with him. It is intimated that the displeasure of the Turkish Government is confined to the personal acts of M. BLONDEEL, and that on his departure it will freely communicate with the Charg6 d'Affaires of the Mission. That this incident will make a stir in Europe is very improbable. Belgium is a small State on the opposite side of Europe to the Turkish Empire; the latter Power is strong with the passive strength which bas brought it through so many dangers, and there is consequently no reason to believe that the PoitTE is likely to retract the step it has taken. Furthermore, we cannot doubt that in this case the SuLTAEs Government has acted under the advice of one or more of the great Ambassa. dors. The conduct of M. BLoNDBEL, which was the immediate cause of the rupture, must have been deeply offensive both to the British Ambassador andto the Austrian Internuncio. The PoRTE will, no doubt, have the support of both of these powerful functionaries, even though its present act may prove a heavy blow to the system which invests them with such large authority. The nature of the relations between Christian diplomacy and native government at Constantinople is now pretty well understood. The timidity of the PoRTE of late years has had the same result as its contemptuous indifference in the day of its power. The four great States, England, France, Austria, and Russia, have been represented from time immemorial by a series of Ministers of the highest class, and possessed of far more than the average of ability. Neither chiefs nor subordinates have been chosen, as a general rule, for those graceful qualities which gain men appointments on the banks of the Seine or the Arno. It has always been felt that work was to be done which could be intrusted only to the firmest and most energetic members of the craft, and consequently the Turkish capital has for years been the battle-field on which the rival Embassies have bearded each other, and united only in enforcing on the PORTE obedience to their high will and pleasure. Now, of course, it is only the Representative of a first-class Power who can hope to turn out Pashas and reject protocols. The Ministers of smal States are of no account in Stamboul, and it is the height of folly for Naples or Belgium to attempt rivalry with the great diplomatic tetrarchy. M. BLoNDMr would have done well to confine himself to his social duties in the Levantine salons, and to the extension of his £egis over any bootmaker or pastrycook of his country who might have settled in the Turkish capital. But in an unfortunate hour the Belgian Minister took himself and his office seriously. Some four years ago, when events occurred which now seem to belong to a past age, K. BLoNDEEr thought fit to express his opinions openly and strongly. These opinions were certainly not such as might have been expected from the Representative of a Western State, with a free constitution, and bound not less by gratitute than by interest to uphold the principles for which France and England were contending. We caunot but trust that the Minister represented no Belgian but himself when he took the side of Prince MENscorFF, denbounced the presumption of the Western Powers, and predicted the failure of their exertions for Turkish independence. It is certainly allowable for any man to discuss the ability of one race to uphold its supremacy over another, and to speculate on the results of military movements; but we believe that X BLoNDEEL passea the bounds of decorum in his vaticinations of ill-success, and did not conceal that in the judgment he had formed the wish was father to the thought. In a place where every European Representative is an oracle, and everything he says is supposed to have an esoteric meaning, the conversation of the Minister was of course repeated, probably with many perversions, and seems to have given risetosome uneasiness at thePoRTE. It isquite possible that M. BLONDnEL in what he said had at first no intention of doing harm; as a man of sense he must have known that the course of events could not be changed by the action of a third-rate State; as a good Catholic he could have no sympathy with Greeks and Russians, and he probably was influenced chiefly by the desire, congenial to some minds, of showing superior wisdom by differing from the general opinion of those about him. But it was not long before his Excellency was led to interfere actively in matters which all the world looked upon as too high for him. In the spring of 1854 the Greek Minister at Constantinople was dismissed or withdrew, and M. BLONDEBL accepted the protectorate of the Hellenic subjects during the suspension of relations. In the affair of the expulsion of the Eellenes and the retirement of General BARAGUAY D'HIEEs the Belgian Minister made his voice heard loudly against the conduct of the PORTE and of Lord STRATFODID DE REDCLIFFr. It is probable that these offences have never been forgiven either by the POBTE or the Ambassador. The Turks have certainly remembered to repay many a slight cast on them during their hour of trial, and the dismissal of M. BLONDEEL may probably have been thought of, if not resolved upon, long since. However, for three years the Belgian Minister remained at his post, aud, the war being finished with his predictions still unfulfilled, he would, if a prudent man, have returned to the quiet routine of his duties. But it would seem that in diplomatists the taste for distiuction, when once acquired, demands constant satisfaction. The question of the Principalities is one of the most delicate which has arisen of late years-so delicate that even men with no official position, and with strong opinions on the subject, have refrained from saying anything which could add rancour to the dispute. France and England are divided, and almost pledged to opposite courses. England finds herself on the side of Austria, with whom she has carried on a war of mutual reviling for the best part of a generation. France and Russia are united for the moment, and Turkey, though with very decided views, c-ndeavours to avoid giving offence to any of the Powers which profess themselves friendly. While the principal statesmen of Europe are pondering how to settle this troublesome matter, what is the course taken by this Belgian functionary, the Representative of a State which is no party to the Treaty of 1856, and whose own interference as an individual has neither been asked nor expected? We learn that he has lately made a tour in the Principalities, and there commenced an agitation in favour of the Union, assuring the people that the Earopean Powers were agreed upon its expediency, and were meditating the establishment of a monarchy under a Belgian Prince! What can have been his object in this foolish crusade it is impossible to tell; the sympathies of the Belgian people are not likely to be in favour of the establishment of a semi-Russian State, even though one of their own Royal family were to have the right of purchasing its crown by apostacy from his faith. The only solution that we can give is, that the vanity of M. BLONDEEL, encouraged for their own purposes by the French and Russian Embassies, has urged him to this escapade; and we regret that the Government at Brussels did not satisfy the legitimate requirements of the PoRTE by re- calling him or addreming to him an offlcial rebuke. The Turks are, no doubt, glad to have the opportunity of asserting their own independence and getting rid of an objectionable diplo. nmatist by the same act. Whatever may be the future extent of Ambassadorial influence in the East, we cannot regret that such excesses as we have described should meet a check. The vigour with which the PorTE has acted on this occasion will, no doubt, have the bebt effect on the forthcoming deliberations at Bucharest and Jassy. It is well that the world should know that the independence whlich Europe has so solemnly recognized is something more than a phrase or a formality.
We invite attention to two distinct protests on the part of Peers, whose signatures are affixed, against the Divorce Bill as it has been sent down from the Lords to the Commons. The first of these protests may be considered as a declaration of the great principle that in Divorce there should be perfect reciprocity between the sexes. In the second, Lords LYNDHURST and HUrcuINsox (DONOUGHImOnE) maintain that wilful desertion on the part of the husband should entitle the wife, not merely to a legal and recognized "separation," but to an absolute Divorce. In the course of the last week we have published other protests in an adverse sense from other Peers and from Bishops, who are of opinion that the Bill as it stands errs on the side of laxity, that it weakens the sanctity of the marriage tie, and that it unfairly imposes a burden upon the consciences of the clergy. Now, in a matter so deeply interesting to the feelings of the community as this is, we had rather bear for a while longer with evils to which EngliSh society has accommodated itself than attempt to jump at once at a perfect settlement when the probable result of such an attempt would be defeat, and the indefinite adjournment of the discussion. We feel the sanctity of the marriage bond as deeply as the Bishop of OXFORD can feel it; we acknowvledge as entirely as Lord LYNDRUEST could desire that the wife is very hardly used under the present, and will be so even under the amended Law of Divorce; but we say that if this battle is to be won it must be won by degrees. Nothing would be simpler than to write a tissue of hysterical declamation about the injuries inflicted upon women, and the injustice which has been done to them under the former state of the law; but the result of such a proceeding would be the rejection of the Bill. On the other hand, it is not difficult to write a tolerably efficient invective against the sin and wickedness of the adulterer; but it does not follow that Parliament would sanction a proposition for making him amenable to the enactments of the criminal law. On the whole, let us be content with what we have got. Don't let us just yet lock up the guilty pair. Don't let us just yet contend for precise parity of rights between husband and wife with regard to the total dissolution of the contract. The Bill, in its amended form, was delivered to us last night, and before it is brought under discussion in the Commons we would briefly state once more what our view of the subject has been throughout. From the beginning, then, of this discussion, this is the position we have endeavoured to maintain :-" Let us have no alteration in the princi"ples upon which marriages are dissolved, either "on the side of relaxation or of stringency. "Let the foundations of the Marriage Law of "England remain undisturbed. Make what changes "you will in the forms of procedure. Sweep "from the practice of our courts any parti"cular form of action which may appear "to have been adapted to another state of society, or to be discreditable to our administration "of justice, or pregnant with dishonour even "to the unfortumate who is compelled to have "recourse to it by reason of the exigencies of "the law. On the other hand, introduce no "fresh severities-no fresh opprobrium-no new "evidence of the obvious consequence of "nuptial guilt-that is, misery and shame. Do "not alter the trim of the balance by one "hair's breadth, lest you let in discussion; and "of discussion it would be difficult to foretell "the result." In fact, if one party sighs for the elastic and transitory unions of Northern Germany, another longs with CnowvEjIAsN fervour for such a Marriage Law as a Puritan Elder would have contrived, and a Puritan congregation would have enforced. Every disputant who has already entered the lists upon this most important contention should remember that if he attempts to bring the marriage customs of England more into consonance with what he believes to be the inspired dictates of the Divine law, he immediatelyinvitesopposite interpretations of this very law, and he may chance to land upon a shore on which he had little thought to set foot. We would not have these islands frighted from their propriety by a suggestion that marriages are to be henceforward regarded by the law as merely nugatory arrangements, to be cast aside at the pleasure of the parties. We know what the marriage customs of England-as far as Divorce is concerned-have been for the last two centuries, and to these we desire to adhere. The only modification we ask, if modification it can be called, is that the facilities for the dissolution of the marriage tie in extreme cases, which have hitherto been confined to the rich, shall be extended to the poor. Step but one inch across this line-introduce any important innovation, and a controversy begins of which the end is not so clear. We regard as quite apart from the question under discussion those minor, but highly salutary, provisions of the present measure which merely deal with " separation," as opposed to " Divorce," with the protection of the property of married women, and other matters of the like kind. All such points are freely open to discussion,-let them be regulated upon the grounds of general policy, and of the most anxious solicitude for the interests of those who can so little defend themselves, and who are so cruelly misused under the existing state of the law. We are speaking of Divorce proper, of Divorce a vincudo-of the rupture of the most important contract into which human beings can enter, even according to the opinion of those who regard marriage as a civil contract-of putting asunder those whom GOD has joined together. Now, the law and custom of England, conjoined, for the last two centuries have produced this result. A man may put away his wife for the cause of adultery. He may recover pecuniary damages, as for a civil injury, from the adulterer. The adulteress and her paramour may, and by the custom of the country do, intermarry when the Act of Divorce has been passed. So it is for the best, as we and our fathers before us have hitherto judged. There has been no further punishment inflicted upon the guilty pair-they have been left to their shame and their dishonourable estate. With regard to the criminal husband the law and custom have been otherwise. Divorce has not been granted at the suit of the wife unless the conduct of the husband has been such as to render cohabitation impossible. All short of an actual dissolution of the nuptial tie the wife may obtain, but at that point we have hitherto stopped short. The results have been obtained by the employment of the clumsiest machinery which was everbrought into play for such a purpose iu any civilized country. That which should have been the judicial decree of a Court has been the legislative act of a Parliament.* The clause permitting the marripsge of the guilty pair has been formally struck out at one stage of the proceedings, and at another as formally restored. The action for damages has been generally esteemed a disgrace to the English administration of justice, and has, no doubt, been constantly used for purposes of collusion. The character of a woman unrepre. sented before the Court might be at any time blasted by this most iniquitous form of proceeding. She was without defender or remedy. Finally, the cost of the whole process was so great that it practically amounted to a denial of relief to all persons save those who were in affluent circumstances. We will now, in a few words, state the result of the proceedings in the House of Lords, which were brought last week to a conclusion upon the points named. Firat, the absurd substitution of a legislative for a judicial process has been abolished, and henceforward we are to have a Court of competent jurisdiction, which will administer justice freely and indiscriminately upon this matter to all the QUEmes subjects alike. Next, the grounds upon which alone Divorce has hitherto been granted have been maintained. Then, the suit for damages in a civil court has been swept away, and in place of it the new tribunal is to have power of fine, but happily not of imprisonment. This point was carried by the LORD CHANCELOR last week; and, if any one should entertain a doubt concerning the sound policy of adhering to our old practice in this matter, let him read the report of the trial of "A MTrGE v. " MADONALD," recently tried in the Common Pleas. Therein will be found a narrative of one of the most startling trials which have ever been reported in the columns of this journal. An attorney had married a young Scotchwoman ten years ago, but had never lived with her nor cohabited -with her-she, in fact, positively refusing to have anything to say to him. Under an assumed name-that of Mrs. SrTx --she wandered about the world, and, among other men, became acquainted with Colonel MAcDoNALD, who is not proved to have known anything of the husband. To this husband the defendant was compelled to pay a fine of 1001. If this Court had possessed the power of imprisonment, what would have been Colonel M AoDow 's fate ? This point, however, is settled by the Lords according to the principles of common sense, and no doubt the Commons will not disturb their verdict. The marriage of the guilty parties after sentence passed is also permitted, so that the Bill comes down to the Commons in a very respectable form. It introduces no serious innovation on our old practice, and, as such, will, we truat, meet with the acquiescence of the Lower House and give satisfaction to the country.
The Civil Service Superannuation question, introduced on two successive nights into the House of Commons, and still left in suspense by the postponement of the discussion, is one of. which the difficulties, as we have already remarked, have arisen entirely from errors of procedure. The case involves no dispute about principle at aL At first sight it might possibly be considered that if the civil servants of the State were recompensed with fitting salaries they might be left to provide for their own superannuation by the ordinary processes of thrift and selfdeniaL This view of the case, indeed, was actually taken by authorities of some eminence 20 or 30 years ago, but the CHfcsimon of the ExcnMqtr= avowed his dissent from it, and the arguments for an opposite policy appear to us entirely conclusive. As a practical result, it is perfectly clear that the State would find itself charged with burdens of this description, whether it under. took them or not. Sir JAmES GRAHAM observed before one of the Committees intrasted with the investigation of this question, that however the case might standas to formal contract, instances of "such " extraordinary hardship would present themselves " on the part of faithful servants, worn out in the " public service, that the claim for a pension upon " retirement would be irresistible." There can be no doubt about the truth of this estimate, and the last Commissioners very sensibly remark that, under such circumstances, it is better economy to assume at once a liability which is certain to be incurred, and allow the assumption to exercise its proper influence upon the scale of remuneration assigned to active service. Here, therefore, are the principles of our public policy in this respect distinctly laid down. The civil servants of the State are to receive certain salaries, and to be entitled on superannuation-i. e., on becoming past their work-to certain pensions. In putting such principles into execution no great difficalty would seem to be obvious, and yet it is at this point that the embarrassments in question have arisen. The speech of Lord NAAs and the reply of the CHNczaxox of the E XCHEQuER contained the history of the case in a very perspicuous form, and tended entirely to the justification of our own remark, that the mistake has been one of procedure only. No person would deny that the assurance of a pension ought to render a smaller amount of salary acceptable than would have been expected without such a prospect, and to this advantage the nation is fairly entitled in the adjustment of its bargains. Unfortunately,however, there was no fair startingpoint from which a system could begin-no period of time at which all salaries could be fixed on the condition that all should carry pensions too. First, the retirement of public servants was managed through the instrumentality of sinecures ; then the cost of superannuation was thrown on the revenue; then this charge, representing a dead-weight, became as obnoxious as charges of that nature usually do; and then, though the arrangement could only be partially adopted, and large classes were excluded from its operation, it was determined to make the salaries provide for the pensions by means of a reduction or abatement from their specified amount. This was the point at which a confusion was created between the salary stipulated and the salary paid. A clerk thought himself entitled to his pensidn in pursuance of known policy and notorious practice. But he also held himself entitled to his salary, and, although it is perfectly true, as Sir G. LEwis declared and Mr. HAIXREY admitted, that the liability of this salary to abatement was thoroughly understood when his services were engaged, so that there could be no breach of contract, it was nevertheless natural that he should be discontented under the effect of the proceeding. At the moment that he was receiving 971. 10s. for his year's wages he knew that he was considered to be in receipt of 100t., and that 1001. had, in fact, been voted by the House of Commons for this very purpose. The deduction therefore operated like a tax, and was felt as a tax, all the more keenly for being se partial in its incidence, that, as Lord NAAS stated, out of 56,740 Civfl servants I 5,311 paid it, and 41,429 did not. Had the clerk engaged himself in the service of the State at a yearly salary of 971. l Os. aR would have been well, and possibly tbis amount, in consideration of the pension to follow, might have been as high as the case required. Again, had it been determined, in accordance with approved reasons, to reduce salaries of 1001. to salaries of 971. IOs., the course would have been clear, and no remonstrance could have been made, or restoration alIiad for,1 E except on grounds admitting ot very easy

SECOND EDITION., THE TrAfESOFFIOR, ThursdaWy Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m.:- General Cavaignac is now officially announced in the Sicle, as also M. Emile Ollivier and M. Darimon, as candidates of the Opposition in the third, fourth, and seventh districts of Paris for the second elections, which will be held on Sunday and Monday next. The Government nominees are the same as before-MIM. Thibaut, Varin, and Lanquetier. It was doubted for some time whether General Cavaignac would again come forward, and whether he would not remain contented with the relative advantage he obtained at the frat trial. I believe he hesitated to the last, and even now, though his name is before the public formally, it is perhaps more out of deference to his fiiends than to any very ardent desire on his part. As to the result nothing can be affirmed. His friends seem to think that the chances are decidedly in his favour, and that many who abstained the last time, either from indifference or apprehension, will take courage from the example of their neighbours, and now record their votes. They calculate a good deal on the tendency of people to side with one who hps already won, and who, though not obtaining the absolute majority required by law, had, at any rate, some hundreds more than his competitor. Though six deputies-three for Paris, and the others for the departments of the Maine-et-Loire, Magenne, and the Somme-have to be elected on the 5th and 6th, the attention of the public is exclusively directed to Paris, as in the provinces the struggle merely lies between persons who profess to be supporters of the Government, and who, doubtless, will also be candidates for its favours. The Pays labours with much zeal to diminish the effect produced on the authorities and on the public by the fact of 98,000 votes having been given for the Opposition candidates. It says:- " In Apil1, 1848, the candidates of the Republlcan Oppo sition, the same who have now come forward, obtained the following anunber oEf votes respectively:- Garnier-Pagds ... - ... ... 240,890 Caiot ...19 ... ... ... ... 195,608 Bethmont ... ... ... ... ... 189,252 De Lasteyrie ... ... ... ... 165,156 Vaw-in ..... ... ... ... ... 151,103 Cavaignac ... ... ... ... ... 144,187 Bastide ... ... ... ... ... 110,228 "There is a great difference between these numbers and the 98,000 collected with much difficulty in 1857. We should like to counpare exactly the numrbers who then voted with that of the registered electors of 1857. This, however, is not possible, the Provisional Government not havin3 thought proper to publish the particulars of the returns at the hotel de Ville in the first days of Mday. All that we learn, from a brief noto inserted in the Monileur, is that the number of voters was about 270,000-vi., 210,000 in Paris, and 60,000 in the arrondissements of Sceaux and St. Denis. In 1857 the number of voters is 215,000. It will be seen, then, that the holders back-if any there be-are very few, even compared to the amount in 1848. It is a matter of regret that the Democrats, who talk constantly or the genuineness of the elections, should have thought it unnecessary to inform us of the number of electors regis. tered in April, 1848. In June of the same year they amounted to 407,000, of whom about 2-50,000 voted, while in 1857 we have had 215,000 out of 356,000 registered elec. tors. So much for the abstention of the Parisian electors Also in 1848, the Democrats obtained, in the person of AL Garnier-Pagis 241,000 out of 270,000 votes, or more thp x eight-tenths. In 1857 they have had 98,000 out of 215,000, or four-tenths. Such is the exact account of their situationnamely, a loss of 100 per cent." The Gazette de France attacks -M. Thiers with violence and with injustice in its leading article of this day. It accuses him of having planned the "electoral fusion" between the Dgbats and the Si&le-which, so far as the candidates or the former are concerned, has failed-" with the object," it says, "of making the world believe that Orleanism was the necessary and accepted form of the notions of liberty which are not ,ealized under the present rigime." It describes 'he plan of M. Thiers as odious in a moral point of view, though admirable as a work of art. " To make the unfortunate princes enter into that hope of fusion with the revolution; to induce them to write letters in which all honourable aspirations, all the regards due to their position, all sentiments of family, and even all truth as to facts, are disregarded and violated; to separate them thus from all that is honourable and worthy of consideration among the ancient servants of their house ; to induce a Princess, blind to the interests of her son, to give to him as a Fdndlon, a man whose political notoiiety is found in a page of anarchy serving as a preface to a civil war ; to force the Journal des Debats to exalt the revolutionary mediocrities, whom it had combated, to sacrifice its position by lending the name of one of its editors to the mirage of a eoalition-all this shows great skill in intrig'ie." I havereason to believe that these charges against M. Thiers ae entirely unfounded. Whatever may be thought of the temporary coalition between the Si&-le and the Dlbats whether it be for good or for bad, I think I can safely affirm that M. Tbiers had nothing to do with it. Before the elections commenced I mentioned the only facts which brought M. Thiers' name in brief connexion with them. That connexion did not extend further than the advice given to the sons (.f M. de PRemusat in the absence of their father, to decline the advances of the coalition, and that advice vas given only v'hen it was asked for. Further than this I am assured that M. Thiers did not interfere, xnd his interference was of quite an opposite character to that stated by the Gazet de France. A despatch has been received this morning at the War-office from Algeria, announcing that General Renault, the result of whose movement was anxiously awaited, had completely succeeded. Therumour of General 'NMahon's death eirculated at Algiers. It is, however, unfounded: the General was not wounded in the affair, though three or four bullets pierced his greatcoat and cap. There were 25 officers hors de combat, and a General-officer and a Colonel of a regiment had their horses killcd under them. The Kabyles defended their position admirably. Their defences were formed of the roots of palm trees and eartb, and were so strongly and skilfully put together as to take several hours' cannonading before they were stormed. PrinceNapoleon will leave, it is said, for England, on the 3d or 5th inst. The Reine Hortense steam corvette has been placed at his disposal. The captain has received orders from the.

" MADRID, Jusz 30. "The Duke de Rivas has received his credenti2ls, and will proceed to Paris as AmbaEsador oh the 15th July. " Two resolutions relative to the law on the press have been presented." Marshal Vailant, the Minister of War, has just received froin the Governor-General of Algeria a report from General de Montauban, commanding the division of Oran, giving an account of the operations accomplished during parx of the mnonth of June by the light columns which had beern charged. to repress the incursions of the hostile wandering tribes of the south-west. The following are the principal points touchcd on:- I After detailing at some length the force of the different columns which had been organized for this service, the line of march pointed out to them, and other details, the report goes on to state that, on the 15th June, Commandant Bachelier, after making a forced march by night, came suddenly on the Donazs of several tribes who had assembled together. The Arabs at farst attempted to make a resistance, but were soon after put to night with the loss of 20 ldlled and about 30 wounded. The French troops also gained possession of 30,000 sheep and nearly 400 camels. The total loss of the French was four men wounded and five horses killed. Commandant Bachelier, after putting his booty in a place of safety, effected a junction with the column of Lieutenant-Colonel Niqueux. Onx the 17th an ostrichhunter announced to the commanding officer the presence of a large caravan from Morocco near Oghat-el-Aticha. A force of 200 cavalry was sent in that deetlon, and they soon came up with the caravan, which was under the direction of the Marabout El-Hadj-Mustapha-Ben Taieb. It was composed of 101 men, 11 women, and 134 camels loaded with different kinds of merchandise. Among the latter were 230 kilogrammes of powder, which was pur. chased by the Frenoh goums in order that it might not get into the possession of hostile tribes, and the caravan was then allowed to proceed, as the officer in command of the French detachment did not consider he had any right to detain it. On the 19th, Captain Colomb, who commanded another of the columns, came up with the Ouled DJerirsI another of the rebel tribes, when a rather sharp engagement took place, but the enemy were compelled to take to flight, abandoning 5,000 sheep, 125 camels, 61 mules, and a considerable booty of different lkinds. Five of 3the Arabs were killed, and it is supposcd that several were wounded. The French had two kiled and six wounded. On the 24th, another caravan, this time belonging to hostile tribes, was fallen in with, also coming from Morocco-105 camels laden with barley were seizci, and proved a welcome supply to the goums. The report concludes by stating that the columns, havsing thus effected with complete success the objcct for which they had been organized, returned to their respective quarters."

The Sultan has at last undertaken his long talked of tour in the Sea of Marmora. Eveiy one thought that he bad given up the idea, or at any rate deferred it until the festivities of the circumcision were over, when, all of a sudden, on Saturday last at noon the Grand Vizier received a notice that on Sunday (that is, yesterday), at 1 p.m., HLis Majesty would start, and wished the Grand Vizier, and his two brothersin-law (Ahmed Fethi, Director-General of the Ordnance, and Mehmed Ali, the Capudan Pasha,) to accompany him. The party, with the exception of Fethi Ahmed, who is ill, started yesterday at the appointed hour. The Sultan will not be absent for more than three, or at the utmost four days; nor has he at present the intention of landing anywhere; he will merely pass down the Gulf of Ismid, and, without stopping, proceed on the Asiatic side as far as Guemlik, the port from which the main road leads to Broussa, and then retrace his steps. These are the present plans; whether they will be adhered to is another questien. As you know, the voyage has been projected for more than a month, and was to have been extended to tbe Archipelago. The Pasha of Egypt, having heard of this project, came up in one of his steamers to meet the Sultan, visiting Smyrna on the way. As the idea of the voyage, however, seemed abandoned, he returned. This trip of the Sultan, ordered and counterordered as it was, is, as every other movement in the palace, brought in connexion with cheuges in the Government, and speculation is so much the more busy as already once a change of air for the health of the Sultan was followed by a change in the Ministry. It is a strange thing with these changes. Since the beginning of the Ottoman history there never has been a reign during which so many changes have taken place as under the present. In 18 years as many as 17 different Govern. ments have been formed, which gives almost one for every year-nay,if we calculate that Redschid Pasha bas been twice in power for several years,we shallfind that there are almost two for each of the remaining years. This is so much the more curious as these frequent changes fall just in an epoch when Turkey is supposed to have abandoned the old system of favouritism under which the Sultan's whims were law, and to have established fixed rules according to which the government of the Empire is to be carried on. The explanation of this apparent contradiction seems to lie in the difference between the forms and the spirit of a Goveximent. Anciently, perhaps, the forms were not so well defined as now, but the same spirit pervaded not only the reign of one, but often of a succession of Sovereigns, while now everything gets more and more shut in by a circle of lifeless forms in which it would be vain to meek for any other spirit but that of intrigue. Thus we see from the beginning of the dynasty of Osman up to the time of Sultan Suleyman the Great, or about 300 years, during which a family of shepherd chieftains became the Sovereigns of a mighty empire, all the Grand Viziers almost invariably chosen out of four families, who often transmitted this dignity from father to son, and carried out systematically that mighty policy to which the empire owes its grandeur. Sure of theirposition, they devotedtheir whole thoughts and energiestotheState, aud,identiying themselves with its weal and woe, they endeavoured to erect a struc- ture which has lasted for centuries. How different, ~iAt now! A Grand Vizi=s is scarcely installed in; -4'sii place when he can already trace a thri3ad ofin-. Zigues which is sure ultimately to pull him lown f on his placQ, Th%,_pteat part of bis er,vgy 1q is obliged to waste in keeping in his position. Woe to him if he forgets for one moment his preca. rious position in order to devote all his thoughts and strength to the welfare of the State. He wilt soon perceive that he has lost ground which he can never recover. How can he build for the future if he is not sure that the very moment he lays down the basis of a new reform another may step in and spoil the whole? He must become like a political Ot6tver, who lives from hand to mouth, careless of the future, because he can have no control over it. He must often sacrifice the best measures in order to carry others; he has to yield against his better convietions, and yet bear the whole responsibility of a failure. When Redsebid Pasha became Grand Vizier the whole State machinery was at a standstill, and several of the pending questions seemed involved in hopeless confusion. His diplomatic skill contributed greatly to the solution of the Bolgrad question; the question of the Principalities soon assumed a brighter aspect through his management. "he whole number of industrial schemes which had been lying at the Porte for months were terminated -a project of a thorough administrative andjudicial reform in the provinces was discussed, and obtained the Sultan'ssanction. Therevenue was considerably increased by putting a stop to the abuses in the farming of the Customs, and various other improvements of aless prominent charactermade ; audduring all this time he had to look about in a continual dread, for no man has more secret enemies. Fabi. tual ingratitude is one of the prominent features of Turkish dignitaries, and most of the men who are so active against the Grand Vizier have been brought forward and raised by him to their respective positions. The European Commission in the Danubian Principalities has constituted itself on the 30th of last month, and has had since that time several sittings, the object of which 'was to inquire into the grievances which have been brought forward against the Kaimalkan of Moldavia, and which, as you will remember, have given rise to a conference of the Ambassadors here. He is accused of having exerted undue influence to facilitate the election of non-Unionists and impede that of their adversaries, and a number of petitions and representations have beenpresented from different employis who havebeen dismissed for their Unionist sympathies,from magistrates who have been threatened withthe same if they did not exert all their influence against the union, and from other persons who complain of the undue influence of the local Government. Of the existence of aU these petitions addressed to the Commission there is no doubt, and several of them proceed from persons of high standing-among them the Metropolitan of MIoldavia bimself; but I am afraid it would be impossible in most cases to make out the exact truth. The consequence is, the Unionists believe everytbing and the Non-unioDists nothing, while, very likely, both are iu an extreme. In spite of the wording of the firman which strictly forbids all interference in or pressure on the elections of the local authorities-nay, even with the best will not to do it-it is almost impossible that what might be termed undue influence should not be exercised by the Goveinment, wbich is known t be against the Union, but there is a great difference between this natural pressure, which must weigh on the opinion of all those who hope something from the Government, and any ovelt act of violence against the opinion of empIyis. Whatever our ideas about the Union may be, it is not a matter of opinion, but a duty to all the Powers who signed the treaty to consult the populations on their wishes, and not to allow anything which might prevent or hinder the expression of these wishes. It ought always to be kept in mind that those wishes, as their vety name indicates;v will not alone decide about the final organization of the Principalities; this WiU be in the hands of a European Congress, and in it, besides the wishes of the Moldo-Wallacbienu, the Interests of Turkey as we]1 as those of Europe will be consulted and weighed. Unfortunately, all those who have made up their minds for or against the Union seem to forget this, and instead of leaving this expression of the wishes oE the population to its natural process, they have both enters1 the field of political agitation, in -which each party 13usng all the arms which it can lay hold of. Wit'i the politioal agitation violent party, and a not lezq sensitive personal, feeling is aroused, which caunob fail to complicate the whole question. The electoral! lists for Moldavia were pul. lished on the 9th and the foltowing days, so that if no other obstacle should come in the way the elections may take place the same days next month, the fiaman requiring 30 clear days from the publication of the electoral lists. Her MIajesty's ship Medina, Captain T. Spratt, left this on Wednesday last for the Danube, where she will be of the greatest service to the Commission of the Danube Navigation. The Medina was up in those parts last year, and all the tb-ee branches of the river have been minutely surveyed and sounded by Lieutenant Wilkinson, under Captain Spratt's supeiintendence, who has drawn up a report on the subject. I shall have to speak of this report at zome other time. I wish only to remark here that these are the first reliable sarveys ever made of that country, and that they nwll, together with the practical suggestions of Captain Spratt, considerably facilitate the work of the Commiesion. On her way from Malta to this place the 3Iedina has made soundings between the foumer island and Candia,wbich has given rome veiy interesting results. The bottom betwveen the two islands appears to be one large valley or basin, with very steep sides, so that at SO to 40 miles from the shores the depth rapidly increases overl,O00fatboms, Showing at the deepest poiat explored as much as 2,000 and odd fathoms. By an ingenlious contrivance Captain Spratt has succeeded in getting up a considerable quantity of peifectly dry and hard yellowish soil from that depth, the examination of which wiU throw considerable light on the foimation of the whole basin of the Mediterranean. According to an announcement of the Messageries Imp6riales, the direct boats of that Companay will leave this from the 1st of July on Wednesdays instead of Mondays. THtE B:R AZILS.

FOBBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. VkrOx 0UR OWN CORRMONDENT.) (Me following appeared in our second edition of yes. kerday :-1 PARIS, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 6 P.Y. The second elections for the Paris districts where the candidates had not obtained the absolute majority will take place on Sunday next, the 5th of July. It is very probable that General Cavaignac will again present himself to the electors, though his determination is not, I believe, as yet irrevocably fixed. He has hesitated a good deal, and so have his friends. They think the experiment that has already been made is stdlicient for present purposes, and that it would not be prudent to risk a second trial, where every means will be employed against him, and where failure would be a far greater check than in the provinces. Of his success we can say nothing. In ofticial regions his defeat is spoken of as certain; whether it is really thought so is another question, but some of his supporters speak of it with doubt. It is all but certain that neither he nor his colleagues will take the oaths to the Emperor; they will content themselves with this evidence of their existence as a party, and they may not go further even in the way of manifestation. M. Goudchaux was from the beginning indisposed to come forward, and he yielded with some difficulty to the entreaties of his friends. However lightly the Government may affect to speak of the success of the Opposition candidates in the capital, it is cortain that it views it with much dissatisfaction. The Emperor, who had constantly been told that the working classes were for him to a man, is disappointed with those on whose attachmenthe counted, and irritated with those whose tinidity or whose sycophancy led him into error. It is not, then, true that the vote of the adverse districts is a matter of such complete indifference as the Mlinisterial organs would lead us to suppose. Previous to the elections those organs directed all their eloquence agvainst the Opposition candidates, aud urged in strong language the importance of rejecting them; and from the importance which they attached to the results it waS clear that the success of General Cavaignac and his fellow-candidates was looled upon as a. check of a very serious character indeed. Their fears probably exaggerated that event, but the attempt now made to diminish it deceives no one. On the other hand, the Republicans, at least the maoderate portion of them, feel much elated at the success, however partial, they have obtained in Paris and elsewhere, and, if we are to beheve them, that success has surpassed their expectations. It wil no longer be asserted, they say, that their party has ceased to exist, that it has pasned from the memory of man, that it has yielded to despair, or that, from a consciousness of utter helplessness, it has rallied to the new r@gi me. It is true that in Paris, which public opinion, or prejudioe if you wiUl, has long regarded as the oentre of political life in France, the Government has obtained 110,000 votes; but it is equaUy true that in the same city, under the eye of the Government, and within the grasp of its agency, the Republicans, disheartened and disorganized as they were thought, have found from 96,000 to 98,000 voices in their favour. The men who have come forward to dispute the victorywith the Government are several of them known to Europe; they have rendered good service in their day, and they are convinced that in case of any great emergency it is to them that even the &ntrgeoism of Paris would look as their safeguard against the excesses of Socialism. It is as well, they say, that these names should come now and then before the public. Such is the reasoning of the party; they form perhaps an exaggerated estimate of the feeling in their favour, but it is certain that such is their estimate. On the question of the Republican candidates taking their seats in the Legislative Body, I believe that -were they more numerous, 1I or 20 for instance, they .would arrange the matter with their consciences, and submit to the preliminary order of the oath. They arc, however, as yet too few to make it worth their while to do so; they will probably content themselves with what they have done, and wait for another and a better occasion. It is now a question with many whether, under such circumstances, the Emperor will modify his polcy, or give additional force to his authority. 'Wil he take the initiative in the introduction of a more liberal system; or wiiU he impose still further restrictions on the little liberty that exists ? Will he narrow the basis on which his fame rests, by pruning down " universal suffrage," and render his government less popudar-that is, less absolute, by courting the support and sympathy of the intelligent and educated classes, rather than of the masses? These are questions frequently asked since the elections. Time only can answer them.

Taix DsVOxccE BILL.-Tho fir9t case under the n.-ove law has been the divorce, owing to differences of temper as sell as circulation, of the A/or.inq HeralcJ and the Standard. The divorce is menad et 7on-y. The Standard is already wedded to Liberalism. The separation took place even before the law had passed, but it eras well known that the parties in question were always in advance of their age. The property was not very large, but it was equalli divided. It is understood that the A-orninq, Berid-still keeps possession of the "American Sea Serpent," while th9 Standard is to be allowed the exclusive run of the "Enormous Gooseberry." There was some dispute about the "Shobwer of Frogp," but a division (or a difierence rather) was happily avoided by its being undestood that the lot was to be split in two-onohalf of the frogs to go to the Herald, and the other half to faU to theS.indard.

The Havannah correzpondent of the Neto Yerlc Times asserts that General Concha had been recalled. to Spain, and says,- " The cause of this sudden change of fortune against him is that the English Ambassador at Madrid has demanded his. recall for openly conniving at the slave trade, and accompanied the accusation with such powerful evidence that; Narvaez has had no other choice than to consent to the' necessity. This fact has affected Concha deeply, as he has. always been ambitions to merit the good reputation ascribed to him by the English press. Be has no one to blame but, himself, for $50,000 per annum ought to place a man beyond the influence of gold. That he has participated in thebribes lavihly expended by the slavedealersnoonehere pretends to deny, and be has been so negligent in this respect; that even his friends have been obliged to confess that theslave trade has been more active since the year 1856 than. was ever known before. At least 20 expeditions have been. fitted out at this port to my owvn knowledge, and there is no. way of finding out the exact number of the cargoes successsully landed.

THE PERSIAN EXPEDITION. (FBO3M OUR OYs CORPMSPONDT.) xMoaAMERAIH, -AY 17. Yesterday thbe 23d Native Infantry, and all the odds and ends of our force, were embarked, and Mohanmerah was entirely abandoned, Sir James Outrara and his Staff remaining on shore tiU every mnan, hord;e, and mule had been safely put oa board. I do not know how these matters are generally muanaged4 but it appears to me that in this instance the embarcation of about 5,000 men, 800horses, 700 aunles, besides camp followers, camp equipages, and wwt6riel, has been effected with surprising despatch. No preparations to that end were begun before the 9th inst., when Sir James returned from Bw,bhire, and on the 17th scarcely a vestige remain.ed of our occupation. Much credit is due to Commander 2Rennie, Acting Commodore of the Indian Navy, whose unwearied personal esertions are beyond all praise. I understand he is to be recommended for a G.B. and a Victoria Cross, and certainly if any man deserves such distinctions he does, as wel for his valuable services generally throughout the expedition as for his indomitable bravery in having constructed and planted the mortar-battery under the Persian forts the night before the attack- upon Ioh:ammerah. The admirable corresponding arrangements on shore are all due, under Sir James, to BrigadierGeneral Lugard, Chief of the Staff, and it is to be hoped that his valuable services will not go unrewarded. I presume it is not generally known, but we all of the force know it right well, that all the credit for the admirable military dispositions taken at Kooshab after Sir James had been disabled was -due to him, and no one felt this more, or would more readily have acknowledged it, than the late General Stalker, second in command on that occasion. Indeed, not only at Kooshab, but throughout this campaign, General Lugard's management of all the details of his office has called forth the admiration as well of the General commuanding as of the Staff and regimental officers aenerally. By his courteous demeanour he has won the esteem and regard of all, and his coolness and decision on the batEle-field prove that he possesses in a high degree the qualifications of a brave soldier and an accomplished commander. Ve trust, indeed, that no feeling of jealousy will restrain the Court of Directors from urging his claims to honorary distinction most warmly. Such tunworthy feelings would be singular in the history of the Persian expedition, for it is acknowledged by all that unanimity between the two services has been nmost perfect throughout this campaign. It could hardly be otherwise with a chief like Sir James (Jutram and a Chief of the Staff like BrigadierLugard. Our occupation of Mohammerah has lasted for six weeks, and during that time we have been on the best terms with the resident and surrounding Arabs. Not one complaint has been made against our soldiers or Sepoys, and the natives were extremely sorry at our departure. The town was made over on the 1lth to Ali Rhan, Sheikh Jaber's nephew, who brought with him a garrison of 120 musketeers to maintain order there and in the surrounding districts. The arrangement made is that the Arabs (Persian subjects nominally) are to hold the place, and to carry on the civil administration conjointly with any agents tbe Persians may choose to depute for that purpose; but no Persian troops are to approach the town until the terms of the treaty are fulfilled. In the meantime our continued occupation will be maintained by two sloops of war, the Clive and the Falkland, which will be anchored, one in the Karoon, and the other in the Shatt-ool Arab. The good understanding which has been kept up throughout with the Perso-Arab tribes,-their neutrality during the late contest-and the readiness -with which they have furnished our force with supplies, are mainly due to the tact and exertions of Captain Kemball, Political Resident at Bagdad, aided and supported by the Rev. Mr. Badger, Sir James Outram's Arabic Interpreter. On these two gentlemen, without the co-operation of any native agency whatever, devolved the task of corresponding -with the chiefs, receiving their visits, settling their intestine quarrels, making arrangements for supplies, and governing them during our occupation of the country. In addition to this, owing, to the dearth of interpreters, every departinent, from the Commissariat downwards, was obliged to refer to them, and the work which thus devolved on Captain Kiemball was immense. Captain Kemball was present at the attack upon Mohammerah, and accompanied the expeditior to Ahwaz, where his services proved most valuable, and in any distribution of rewards his name should stand among the first. It is much to be regretted that the Court of Directors do not hold out greater facilities to the officers of their service to study Arabic. There was abundant work during the late short campaign for at least 15 duly qualified interpreters, whereas there was only one in the whole force who could act in that capacity. No little inconvenience and great difficulties and delays were consequently experienced, especiaUy by the Land Transport and Commissariat Department, -whose agents, scattered over the country, where Arabic is the only language spoken, were comparatively helpless. In Persian we were somewhat better off; but, even in this respect, there did not appear to be an officer present with the force who could indite a proper Persian letter without the aid of a native moonshee. This state of things, especially during a war, when it is frequently of the greatest moment to keep correspondence secret, is much to be deprecated; and it is accordivgly to be hoped that steps will be taken to secure higher qualifications in our officers who pass in Persian, and who should be entirely independent of all native co-operation. Sir James Outram starts to-day in the Planet for Bagdad, in order, as we understand, to confer with the Hon. Mr. Murray respecting a conimission to be dlespatched to Herat to see that the conditions of the treaty with regard to the evacuation of that place by thePersian troops are effectually carried out. I am happy to state that the General appears in excellent health and spirits, and continues to enjoy the devotion and love of the troops under his cominand. Never was a chief more beloved by all ranks, and had the war been protracted they would have signalized their attachment by many a bold and dashing affair. As it is, they have bebaved bravely and nobly, and deserve the highest praise which the country can confer upon them. What the Queen or the home authorities may do to evince their appreciation of Sir James Outram's merits remains to be seen; but if perfect success has any claim to national distinction, that distinction, I trust, will not be withheld from one whose rapid movements and their attendant victories were mainly instrumental in obtaining the immrediate acceptance of the treaty, and thereby putting an end to the Persian war. BAGDAD, ?av 25. Sir James Outram and part of his Staff arrived here in the Planet the day before yesterday, and landed at the Residency under the salute due to his rank, wrhich was immediately returned by the garrison. The highest Turkish military authority, Khairi Pasha, met him as he disembarked, charged with the respects and congratulations of the Governor, Resheed Pasba, and to-day Sir James pays ia -visit ot ceremony at the Serai. Irmmnse crowds of people tbronged the banks of the river to see the renowned English General. The Hon. Mr. Murray and his suite are stiU here, waiting the arrival of the Persian official charged -with the apologies stipulated for, and comnMisioned to accompany his Excellency to Teheran. The officer is a Sarteep, or Brigadier, and is expected to arrive here in a few days. Accounts received from the Persian capital represent the Shah as having been dreadfully excited on receiving the intelligence of the capture of Mohammerah. The treaty had reached him the day previous, and he lost no time in affixing his signature to it, giving special directions himself for its immediate despatch to Bagdad. Had the terms been tenfold more stringent, there is little doubt but that His Majestv would have aocopted them witholut scruple, despite the opposing influence of certain parties at Teheran. However, by insisting upon so little beyond the independence of Herat and Affghanistan, the Hoome Ministry have displayed their wisdom and prudence; for, if we are sineero in our expressed desire to uphold Persia, and to strengthen it as an indepen- dent monarchy (which is undoubtedly our best volfey), it is obvious that the less we humble ler the better for our future relations with that country. This war over, it is to be hoped that the time is far distant before we shall be called upon to treat Persia as an enemy. As you observed in one of your late articles, much will depend upon the tact and bearing of the Minister who hall repreoewt Great Britain at the Court of the Shah for the next few years whether we attach Persia to us or throw her into the arms of )Russia. Do the antecedonts of the Bon. Mr. Murray at Teheran hold out any reasonable hope that he is the man to cement a real and cordial friendship between Persia and England ? I think not; neither, as far as T am aware, have we many men available for so important and delicate an appointment. Could the Foreign-office lay aside for once the impression that such positions can only be held suitably by members of the aristocracy, they could not do better than promote Captain Kemball from Bagdad to Teheran. I would gladly stake a fortune, were such atmnydisposal,upontheresult, feeling perfectly convinced that hiis character would carry such weight, and his calm, temperate, deliberate, and conciliatory deportment win such generaL attachment, that British influence would eoon predominate in the councfis of the Shah.
T.HB SCHOOL AND TRE CUPBOARD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir,-In a late leading article on the Education Conference you brought Mrs. Hubbard and her son Bill forward in aid of your most true arguments on the Bubject. There is no one historical character whose name you could have more properly ursed for your purpose. The period at which village boys wil be removed from the village school is simply a matter of cupboard; Mother Hubbard in her family economy will only allow Bi to draw rations from her cupboard free up to that period of life at which he can begin to earnr, or to learn how to earn, bread to put into it. She has each week to count the maouths which consume against the hands which can produce; she will seize the earliest moment to convert a consumer into a producer. The very poorest of dogs plead to her for a bone in vain ; but little meat ever finds its way into her cupboard, and of that the " Bills" have the bones. Mrs. R. will tell the parson or his wife, with much truth, "that boys get soft like when kept too long at larning; the pen and the book be all right for the poor things, but they hands of BiU's must get a bit hard afore he can hold plough or handle fork. She don't hold to keeping children too long in-doors who have to get their bread in the fields." I confess, Sir, I agree with Mrs. Hubbard. I feel that the necessity laid upon a labourer's child to earn his own bread at the earliest moment is one which I cannot contest. I know that in order to stand exposure to all kinds of weather-the lot of out-door labour-it is -well for a boy to be early inured to it. I am quite convinced he will be no happier in the particular field of labour which is his destiny for that amount of schooling I see so many desirous to give him. In any good school a cbild can be taught to read with ease, to write a fair, legible hand, and to do all the arithmetic necessary for the common purposes of life by the time he is 10 years of age; in addition to this he can by that time have been well grounded in the truths of revealed religion, and should have acquired habits of obedience and propriety which will go far to form his future character. The use of machinery in agriculture has supplanted in a great degree the call for adult human muscle and sinew; it has at the same time created a demand for the labour of the very young. Where large families used to be considered as objectionable parochial burdens I now see them regarded as valuable auxiliaries to the employers of the parish. Emigration has given the call for more mechanical appliance, each successive mechanical invention calls more of early life to early labour. I cannot regret this, for I see the people living better, better clothed, more constantly employed, and somewhat better housed than they were 10 years ago. I never knew thera more patient and contented with their lot, and it is often a hard one. I know there is a great call among them for cheap but good books, and that they read them. I know the dull monotony of the field of labour to which they are destined. I have grave doubts as to whether much intellectual training would not discontent them with that field. I am sure it would not conduce to their contentment, and therefore must be opposed to their happiness. As to the " crime"' question, it is not a year or two's more schooling which will affect that in any appreciable degree. The poor are more often detected in crime than the rich, because they are more constantly watched, and the crimes to which they are tempted are just those easiest to detect. But this I say in justice to them as a class, compare those who can read, write, and sum but a little with those who have had the greatest educational privileges, and I believe you would find that in this our day, before Gxod, the former are the purest in life, the most honest, the most tempted, the most loyal -yes, and the most Christian. The number of acquaintances and friends I have had through life probably may have been in amount about the same as the population of the village in which I have now lived nearly 16 years. I think through life I have been most fortunate as to the society I have enjoyed; and yet, I say it without one shadow of doubt, I cannot on the whole claim a higher moral status for the friends of past and present life than I can for my villagers, few of whom remained at school after they could earn the smallest amount of bread. I must further be understood as including under the head of " friends and acquaintances" men of every rank and profession, some few Cabinet Ministers, and a fair proportion of bishops. There is an evil of too prolonged schooling to wbich I have as yet seen no allusion-viz., its tendency to relieve the parents too much of their proper share in the rearing of their children. Who has not heard the excuse from the parent for a child's sin,-" I can't tell how it is, I can't; I sent her to school as soon as she could walk, and kept her there till she went to service." What say the aged women? " Ah, Sir, to see how the young married folk carry on; the infant school takes them when amost babies; t'other school takes all the rest; 'tis but the getting them up, putting them to bed, and the putting out the vittles; they ha'n't the trouble with a family as we hacl in our day." In my poor opinion we run some risk of maaking our schools mere nurseries for young mothers, who never at home saw anything of a mother's real duty. I am quite sure we are making marriage very easy, the road to single, useful " service" very difEcult. People complain they cannot get female servants. Do they think years passed in an educational machine, the cramming the head, and fitting the hand to nothing but pen, pencil, and needlework, a promising process for the production of "maids" of any work? Where, where has common sense fled to S. G. OSBO}RE.

MAJES2LTS JbISIT T M a I (FROM 0U OWN CORERSPONDENT.) c MANCHESTER, J'uxr. L It would be difficult to imagine any greater contrast than the scene wbich presented itself to visitors going to the Arts Treasures Exhibition before the Queen's arrival on Tuesday and thatj which they witnessed on their return. .& route toI the building everything was brilliant and cheerful; literally hmndreds of thousands of people were| abroad, and the handsome decorations of almost every house were new and untarnished. But during the greater part of the time that Her Majesty's visit lasted the rain fell in torrents, a keen easterly wind sprang up, and the aspect of everything was utterly changed. The roads were deep with the softeat and most penetrating mud, the outdoor portion of the audience were more or less cold and wet, and the devices had undergone all the changes which an unlimited supply of the pure element naturally works on tinselled and coloured draperies. The banners, which in the morning had been refulgent with loyal mottoes, were soaked with rainor, tangled round their staffis, looked like bundles of particoloured rags. Rosettes had disappeared, garlands were beaten out of shape, tinsel could only be known by its faint, discoloured gleams, and the gilt letters of inscriptions were washed away, leaving only a mutilated consonant here and there to puzzle the spectators into guessing what the sentence had originally been. Nevertheless, the people of Manchester put the beat face upon the matter, and half an hour after the rain had ceased every street and footway was as densely thronged as in the morning. St. Anne'ssquare was particularly crowded, and resembled a kind of muddy Arcadia, of which only a favourable view could be obtained from the surrounding windows. There was no attempt at a general illumination, though on the whole there was a fair show of transparencies and devices in gas and coloured lamps sufficient to keep the people in the streets til near midnight. HIer M£ajesty and the Royal family and suite quitted Worsley-hall this morning at 9 o'clock, escorted by a detachment of the 4th Dragoons, and arrived at the Art Treasures a little before 11. A we have already said, the visit on this occasion was most strictly private-only the members of the executive committee, Mr. Deane, its indefatigable General Commissioner, and the heads of the departments being present. So rigidly was this rule adhered to that we believe a list of the names of those gentlemen whose duties required their attendance on this occasion was made out and submitted for the approval of Her Majesty, and beyond these none entered the building. His Excellency the Prussian Minister and the Countess Bernstorf' were of course invited to attend. The Royal party remained in the building nearly four hours, and the whole of this time wras devoted to minutely inspecting the various objects of interest in the collection. The picture galleries formed, of course, the principal attraction. During the visit the executive committee had the honour of presenting for the inspection and acceptance of Her Majesty some most beautiful photographs, selected from Messrs. Agnew and Colnaghi's work, of the principal art treasures of the collection. A few minutes after 2 the visit terminated and Her Majesty, accompanied by the Princess iRoyal and Princess Alice, returned to Worsley-hall, by Salford and Peel-park, at a rapid rate. Aconsiderable number of spectators had collected to witness her departure, and received her with the usual hearty demonstrations. It had been publicly announced that the Queen, after her private visit to the Exhibition, would avail herself of the opportunity of seeing the newly-erected statue of herself in the Peel-park, which she must pass on her return to Worsley. The statue is a colossal figure of the Queen, in white marble, by Mr. Noble, and was raised il commemoration of Her Majesty's visit to the Peel-park on the 10th of October, 1851, when she was received by an assemblage of 80,000 Sunday scholars and teachers. It was inaugurated by Prince Albert on the day after the opening of the Art Treasures Exhibition. To witness the Queen's presence for the second time in a place which a succession of popular events during several years past has rendered one of much interest there were assembled this morning, for some hours before the expected arrival, many hundreds of well-dressed people, most of them ladies, besides the members of the corporation of Salford. The company were admitted only by ticket, and there was consequently no inconvenient crowd. ing, and as the spectators lined each side of a circuitous promenade along which the Royal carriage was to pass thosel present might have a more than usually confident assurance of seeing the Queen herself. The hope was, perhaps, in no instance disappointed. Her Majesty arrived at the park in an open carriage, about 25 minutes past 2 o'clock, and, the weather being fair, every one might have a full view of the Sovereign, as well as of the Princess Royal, the Princess Alice, and the Duchess of Satherland, who were in the same vehicle. The Royal carriage, followed by others containing the suite, and accompanied by a vey small escort of Dragoons, stopped only for a minute or two in front of the statue, where Her Majesty, who did not alight, exchanged a few words with the Mayor of Salford, and seemed very much pleased with the memorial, vhich has already received a good share of public admiration. The carriages then proceeded out of the park, the visit to which only occupied about five minutes, and thence direct to Worsley. The road outside the park gates was exceedingly thronged with people, and the Queen was heartily cheered. Ris Royal Highness the Prince of Prassia did nob return direct to Worsley, but, accompanied by their llighnesses the Prince Consort, the Prince of Wales, and Prince Alfred, and attended by the Prussian Minister, Coun' Moltke, and several members of the suite, proceededto the Town-hall for the purpose of receiving a congrrtulatory address from the Mayor and Corporation of the city of Manchester. Considerable interest was evinced to witness the proceedings on this occasion, and, though it was quite uncertain at what hour the illustrious visitor would arrive, and quite certain that he could not come before 2 o'clock, yet the hall was crowded with the elite of Manchester long before that time arrived. The building was decorated with considerable taste both inside and out. At the upper end of the hall a dais was erected, on which was a srall canopied seat of honour or throne, the background of the principal seat being filled with a silk banner, emblazoned with the Black Eagle of Prussia. The artist had evidently been unable to embody his conception of this noble bird, for the result was something black, not unlike the pictures of the bottle imp or those mediEeval armchairs so suai gestive of anything but sitting i-1. What the Prince of Prussia must have thought of such an ornithological caricature it is impossible to say, unless, indeed, he regarded it as contribuling largely to the general hilarity and festivity of the proceedings, which it certainly did. The corporate arms of the city were displayed on banners round the walls and dome of the hall, and either side of the dais wvas draped with variously coloured flags, which produced a striking and most brilliant eff^ect. The interior of the build- mg, however, was much too small to permit of any really effective display being made. The illustrious party arrived at the Town-hall at 20 minutes past 2 o'clock. An immense concourse had collected outside, who madethe street ring again with continued and deafening cheers. A guard of honour from the 25th Reginent received the co,ge with the usual Royal salute. On entering the hall the audience rose in a body and received their Royal Highnesses with the most enthusiastio demonstrations of applause, which were again and again renewed. Prince Frederick seemed both surprised and moved at his reception, and continued to bow his acknowledgmecnts till silence was gradually restored. Sir James Watts then advanced at the head of the aldermen and members of the town-council, and Mfr. Heron, the town-clerk, read the address, as follows:- "To es RoYgA HiGmxss PpmCF FnXnIicK WiL. LrAS or Pujsss&. "M May it please your Royal Highness, " We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and dtizens of the city of Manchester, approach your Royal Highness to offer our most sincere and cordial welcome upon the occasion of your visit to this city. " As the representatives of the great community by which we are surrounded, we hail with satisfaction the presence among us of your Royal Highners, who in all probabilit, will hreafteor be called upon to zrle over a great nation which has been long closely allied with this contry; and that a; opportunity is thus afforded to your Royal Hilhness of becoming acquainted with those vast and important interests connected with commerce and manufacture;, o! which Manchester is the centre, and upon the success of which the wealth and prosperity of this country so largely depend. " We rejoice that the occasion of the visit of your Royal Highness to this city, with Her Most (racions AMajesty, has aflorded us the opportunity of thus publicly presentiog our wann and hearty congratulations to your Royal Highness upon tho intended alliance between your Royal Highness and the Princess Royal of England. " We offer these congratulations in the full and confident belief that by such auspicious union the happiness of the Princess Royal will be secured, and the fondest wishes of our beloved Qaeen in her behalf bo realized, while the friendly feeling wrhich has happily so long sabsisted between :England and Prussia will be thereby strengthened and perpetuated, and as the conseqaence great advantages Will result to the people of both countries. " Given nmder the common seal of the Corporation this l7th day of June, l857'. His Royal Highness then, receiving his reply from Count Miiltke, proceeded to read it in a clear and very loud tone of voice, so as to be distinctly audible to every person throughout the hall. His Royal Highness spoke with only a slight German accent. On that part of his reply which referred to his intention to d O all in his Power to secure the happiness of the Princess Royal he laid marked and emphatic stress, and elicited applause which lasted some time. His -.eply was aS follows: "It is with the greatest satisfaction that I receive the expressions of sincere and cordial welcome which the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of the city of Manchester have addressed me on the occasion of this my first visit to this town. "I am happy to be able to gratify on this occasion the desire which I have long felt to visit in person a town and district which is of such great imnportance to this land, and the influence of which on the progress of industry is as well-known and appreciated in my own country as irn England. (Applause.) " I beg now to thank you for the hearty congratulations you express to me upon my intended alliance with her Royal Hlghness the Princess Royal. I hope that God's blessing may rest upon this union, in which to secure the happiness of the Pincess Royal will bo the dearest duty of my lfe. (loud cheers.) " I sincerely rejoice with you in the prospect of this union drawing still closer for the future the ties of friendship happily existing between Prussia and this great nation." (Cheers.) rmmediately after the reply was delivered to Sir James Watts their Royal Highnesses quitted the hall, the whole proceedings having lasted less than ten minutes. A magnificent collation was' prepared in the Mayor's parlour, of which their Royal Highnesses partook, and took their departure from the Town. ball at half-past 3 precisely. After the terzmination of the Royal visit yesterday there was a great rush of shilling aightseeers into the building, swelling the total number of those who passed in during the course of the day to upwards of 14,000. The Royal visit to Manchester terminates tomtorrow nrtorning. Her Majesty will leave Woraleyhall at 9 o'clock for the Patricroft station, from which tbe Royal train will start at half-past 9 precisely, arriving in London at 3 20.
DEBAT of t7e DUKE of MARLBOROUGR. We have to announce to our readers that his CGrace the Duke of Marlborough died yesterday at his princely seat of Blenheim, after a very short illness, in the 64th year of his age. George Spencer-Churchill, fifth Duke of Marlborough, Marquis of Blandford, Earl of Sunderland, BaronSpencer, of Wormleighton, Baron Churchill, of Sandridge, and a Prince of the Holy Romau Empire, was the eldest son of George, fourth Duke of Marlborough, by Susan, daughter of John, seventh Earl of Galloway, in the Scottish Peerage, and wa% born at Bill Hill, in the parish of Sunning, Berks on the 27th of December, 1793. He received his early education at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and first entered upon public life as Marqxus of Blandford in the summer of 1826, when he was elected as one of the members for his father's pocket borough of Woodstock, whichhe continued to represent down to the dissolution consequent on passing the Reform Bill, in December 1832. On the retirement of Captain Peyton, in 1838, he was again elected for WMoodatock, and continued to hold a seat in the Bower House for that borough until the month of March, 1840, when the death of his father caused him to be summoned to the House of Peers. In 1845 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commanding the Oxfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry, and succeeded the late Earl of Macclesfield as Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotuloruna of the county of Oxford in 1842. His Grace was also patron of no less than 11 livings in the established church. The title of MIarlborough (the only counterpart of Welington that is to be found on the roll of the Elnglish Peerage) was conferred, as our readers are aware, in 1702, upon John Churchil, the most celebrated captain of the age in which he lived, if not the first general in the military annals of England. Hlis Grace married Sarah Jennings, daughter and co-heiress of Richard Jenuings, Esq., o Sandridge, county Herts, by whom he had (besides an only son, who died early) four daughters, who were married respectively to the Earls of Godolphin and Sunderland, and the Dukes of Bridgewater and Montagu. Having no prospect of heirs maleafter the early death of his son, and desiring to see his honours and estates settled on his posterity, he obtained in 1706 an Act of Parliament for that purpose, andin the following year a pension of 5,0001. a-year was settled in perpetuity on himself and his descendants. His titles had been already conferred with remainder on all the Duke's heirs whether male or female. The Emperor Leopold at the same time created his Grace a Prince of the Empire, and his sr.ccessor, the Emperor Joseph, bestowed on him as a stiU more solid reward the principality of Mindelheim, in Swabia. The Great Duke died in 1722, and was succeeded in the dukedombyhis eldest daughter, the Countess of Godolphin, on whose death in 1733 the title and estates passed to her nephew, Charles Spencer, fifth Earl of Sunderland, who became second Dake, but whose ancestors had sat in the Hiouse of Lords since 1603 as Lords Spencer, of Wormleighton.* By his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Lord Trevor, his Grace had three sons and two daughters. He was a Brigadier-General in the army, and commanded a brigade of F?ootgusrds at the battle of Dettingen, and was ultimately Commanlder-in-Chief of the British forces intended to serve in Germany under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. His eldest son, George, third Duke, by his wife Lady Caroline Russell, daughter of John, fourth Duke of Bedford, had issue, besides several daughters, two sons, of whom the younger was created Lord Churchhill in ]815, and the elder was the father of the Duke so recently deceased. He was called to the Upper House during his father's lifetime as Barou Spencer, and died, as we have already stated, in 1840. The last Duke was three times married-first, in 1819, to his cousin Lady Jane Stewart, eldest daughter of the eighth Earl of GaUloway, who died _ i 1844; second, in 1846, to the Hon. Charlotte I Augusta Flower, daughter of Viscount Ashbrook,a -who died in 1850; and thirdly, in 1851, to Mliss Jane Frances Clinton Stewart, daug,hter of the H Non. Ed ward Richard Stewart, who aurvives him. His Grace has surviving issue by each of his 4 marriages, and is succeeded in his title by his eldest son by his first wife, John Winston, Marquis of Blandford, who has sat for Woodstock for several years, and unsuccessfully contested Mddlesex in 1852, and who has now become sixth Duke of Marlborough. His Grace was born in 1822, and married, in 18483, the Lady Jane Frances Anne Vane, daughter of the late and halfsister of the present Marquis of Londonderry, by whom he has a youthful family of three sons and three daughters. As a member of the Lower House of the Legislature his Grace has been distinguished for the introduction of many useful measures"for the reform and extension of the established church both at home and abroad, and we doubt not that he will prove a valuable addition to the councils of the Upper House. It may not be uninteresting to our readers to be reminded here of the terms upon which the Dukes of Marlborough hold Blenheim from the nation. It was enacted in 1704 that "On every 4th day of August, the anniversary of the victory of Blenheimn, the inheritors of the Duke's honours and titles shall render at Windsor unto Her Majesty, her heirs, and successors, one standard of colours, with three leurs ds lis painted thereon, in acquittance of all manner of rents, suits, and services due to the Crown of England." It is by a similar tenure that the Duke of Wellington holds the mansion of Strathfseldsaye, and ia each case the acknowledgment of the Royal or national favour is annually paid down to the present time. * The Earl Speneer to the present day represents a branch of this noble family.
IRELAND. (Flom OUR OWN COIRRSPOYDET.) DUBLIN, WFWEDNDAY MORNING. TIBE MURDER OF MIR. IlTLE. Nothing very material has transpired up to this morning. The adjourned investigation will be held at II o'clock in the forenoon, but it is still uncertain whether any new evidence will be produced to sustain the case for the Crown. In the event of none being offered the inforrnations will be read over to the prisoner, and a formal application made for his committal on the capital charge. The folowing is from the Freeman of this morning:- "1 The police, under the direction of Mr. Superintendent Guy, have been indefatigable in collecting evidence against the prisoner Spollen aince the time he was remanded on Saturday last, when a general search was commenced for everything that could tend in anyway to strengthenr the case for the Crown. In this search one ot the canvass bags wbich contained a portion of the money stolen from the cash-office of Mr. Little on She night of his murder was found on Monday last by Constablo Dor,nelly under a heap of stones near the hydraulic ram adjoining the privy, where the painter's tub was fotnd, which contained the 67O. 5s. in silver. Thisbag is all torn, and it is believed that it was concealed where it was found by the person who hid the money in the privy, and it is also believed that that person was in the habit of taking money out of the booty he had hidden whenever he required it, and that this bag was concealed when all the money it contained had been expended. The pl9es of timber, sleepers, and iron rails in the neighbourhood of the cottage where the prisoner resided were all turned overand carefully examined by the police yesterday, but nothing was found. The chimney, in which it is stated the prisoner placed the bucket containing the money on the night of the murder was also examined,whenit wasfounnd that at abonui18inches from its top, on theinside, there was the impress of the basket on the soot, and also the sign of the holdfast in the masonry, on which Mrs. SpoUen stated her husband had rested the bucket when he ascended the chimney on the night of the murder. It was determined on that the canal in front of the terminus and the harbour should be drained for the purPOse of trying to get the still missing key of the cash-offimce. he work of drainiDg commenced yesterday, and the bed of the canal and harbour will be so far free from water this day that the search can be carried fully ont. To make this course as effective as possible a large number of police will be placed on duty to prevent any person comning near or in any way interfering with the debris of the canal which will be throwvn on the banks for thorough searching. Although this portion of the canal had been searched by the police it is suspected the person who wished to conceal the key could not select a better place of concealment than the canal after the water was readrnitted, as there was little probability of its being again drained and searched. If the person who made a present of a razor to the prisoner identifies it he will be brought up as a witness at the examination to take place this day in Capel-street Police office. When the child Lucy Spollen -was giving her evipence on Saturday last she said, when identifying the piece of cloth in whiich a part of the money was found wrapped up, that her father said to her,-'Say you don't know if any person asks you did you ever see this piece of cloth or chamois before.' It 'was not then understood what the child meantby the piece of chamois. It is now stated that the prisoner had mnade a case for one of his razors out of a piece of chamois, and that it was to that he referred when cantinning the hild. The police had not decided yesterday on bring,tng up the prisoner's son to give evidence against him on this day, and, in aQl probability, he will not be produced unless the magistrates are of opinion that additional testimony will be necessary to justify them ia committing the prisoner for trial." ACTION AGAINST A RAILWAY COMPANY. Dr. White, late Inspactor-General of Lunatic Asylums, has brought an action against the directora of the Waterford and Kilkenny Railway for inju-ies sustained by the accident which occurred in the month of November last, and by which five or six lives were lost, and several persons, including Dr. WVhite, more or less injured. The case was opened on Monday in the Court of Queen's Bench and closed yesterday, the jury finding a verdict for the plaintiff with 2,5001. damages and 6d. costs. TEE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

The prisoner Spollen was again brought up today to Capel-street Poliee-office, when the depositions taken on Saturday were verified, but no new evidence of importance was offered. fir. Corballis, on the part of the Crown, applied to the magistrates to commit the prisoner for trial. AMr. Curran objected, and called on the counsel for the Crown to state whether or not they had any other evidence; when Mr. Corballis said, the distinct answer to that is that there is. Under these circumstances the magistrates refused to commit finally, and the prisoner was remanded to Thursday, the 9th inst.
THE INDIAN At UTZ". TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Much as we may deplore the bloodshed and disorganization resulting from the recent mutinies in India, no partial observer of the progress of native society can fail to rejoice that the moment has arrived when the Government must yield to the suggestion frequently offered, that it is expedient greatly to redace the nativo army and substitute for the disbanded a smaller but more reliable European force. The diseases of society, like the disorders incidental to the human frame, always seein to require a crisis before the curative agencies can be rendered efficacious. Heaven knows how long the gross imperfections of our own army would have continued to floarish like evil weeds, had notthe Crimean warbrought them toaculminatingpointand forced remedial measures upon our attention. The Indian mutiny, though perhaps of less importance to the European eye than a war with Russia, is, nevertheless, in its way a very instructive catastrophe, and I venture to call uponyon, as the great pioneer of all our social reforms, to afford your powerful aid in contribating to the only remedy for the evils which affect us in India, and the only sure protection against dmilar calamities in the future. Many of the raost distirguished officers of the Indian army have held high opinions of the bravery and fidelity of the native troops. Malcolm, Adams, Ochterlony, Nott, and others were loud in their praise, because they had on several occasions displayed great daring, self-denial, and an ardent attachment to the British Government. Granting their morit, it must still be admitted that the pernicious consequences of their caprice and the limited character of their utility more than counterbalance their pretensions to be regarded as a force worthy of respect andretention. The Indian army is, at best, but a local police, possibly ueeful, under Earopeark example, in protecting the frontier against external foes (wvhen we have not any to the North), but anything but reliable as a protection against internal discord, and quite effete as an auxiliary in European wars. A country like England, irn forming an army, should have in view its adaptation to aU our wants foreign, domestio, and colonial. The facilities of intercourse established all over the world admit of the rapid removal of troops to any point where their services may be requireda Their suitableness for general employrment should therefore 'se the first consideration in their formation. This important point has been overlooked in creating the Indian army, and we consequently experienced the mortification of know. ing during the late war with Russia that we were paying upwards of 250,000 men whose services were not available in the greatest struggle in which we were ever engaged. This alone is an argument against the retention of a dis. affected force upon its present scale; but others seggest themselves, irrespective of the inapplicability of the army to general parposes and tho pervading mutinons spirit. The proximity of England to our Indian Empire, which admits of the rapid despatch of reinforcements; the establishment of the railway system in India, which enables us to dispense with the Sepoysas treasure escorts, provision and store convoys, &c. ; the introduction of the electric telegraph and the extinction of alt frontier foes vith whom it were difficult to fight an even battle, constitute irresistible ar. guments in favour of early and extensive reductions. We may, perhaps, be exposed to the bare chances of an irruption of Affghans or Nepaulese, but, inasmuch as the Sepoys demonstrated in the last wat with the former and with the Sikhs, how incapable they are of competing with hardy mountaineers or organized troops, our sole relianoe must be on the Europeaus. From these general reasons against the continuance of the employment of the native troops we may go to the causes immediately in hand-the disposition to mutiny which the Sepoy has manifested during the last 80 years, and espe. cially at the commencement of any campaign. He has nerer been at a loss for a pretext for disaffection. In those mo. ments he contrives to forget that he Is a " Nimul walla.? The salt of the East Indian Company has then lost its savour. He either discovers that he will lose his caste if he goes from the Indian sbores by sea, or he wants extra batta, or he needs carriage, or he wishes to take his family with him, each of these being so many grounds of extortion. In peace time bis discontent finds vent in his affected attacbment to his religion-sometimes leather has been his abhorrence, and now he has found arutinous allyirmu"tiQi fat. I say deliberately his "affected attachment,"p bi Cause the instances are not rare in which the Sepoy ,Ag readily adopted usages which are incompatible with the strict injunctions of caste. These may, in the minds of dispassionate men; ap. Pear to be valid reasons why we should take advantage of the present crisis to work out an organic change in the constltation of onr Indian army, and I conjure you not to relax in your efforts to achieve so very important an object. In theopiDionsheroexpressedIpresent the result of 20 years' experieneeof India and anintitnate acquaintance with the army of our Mastern territories. They are probably opposed to those of the East India Company's Government and the offlcers in their smploy, but they lose, I submit, but little of their cogency on that account. The constitution of the Court of Directors disQualifes it from the candid and impartial consideration of the subject at imue. The intimate relations of the majority of that body to the civil and military services, the vast patronage whic! the continuance of the present system concentrates in their hands, and the dslike which settled Governmerts entertain to great inno. vations which inrvolve trouble and igrore their claims to pre-eminent wisdom, form strong grounds fortbeir resistance to the sweeping change which recent circumstauces so power. fully recommend. A national pressure is therefore indispensable, and as the British House of Commons is either too much occupied with matters of far less consequence at home or nearer home, andhas a fashion of countingitself oukt when Indian themes are brought upon the tapis, I repeat my entreaty that 2TW Times will become the organof the resulti of experience. India, I repeat, has nothing to fear from foreign invasion. The great bugbear Russia broke downinherattemptinl840 and her army was destroyed before it reached Khiva by famine, cold, and pestilence, and she hasfurnished us recently with a far more memorable and decided proof of her inability to maintain armies at any distanco from her centres in the celebrated siege of SebastopoL It Russia be unable to support an army in her own territory, in one of the most formidable strongholds in the world, what possibility is there of her marching an army over deserts and impracticable roads, removed from her own territory and supplies by vast distances, to encounter in the Bolan or the Khyber Passesplaces of great natural strength-a British force in its own territory, amply supplied, with all theresources of India as its back, and with railways concentrating troops on all and every point necessary? But, if invasion were ever possible, it can only be met and resisted successfully by European troops. If it were being attempted at this moment we might find our native army flocking to the standard of our foes, and deranging and disorganizing all the plans of our wisest and best generals. India has only to dread the Sepoys whom we enlist and pay -the population are quiet and peaceable deprived of the Arms of strength and the nuclecs for organized and armed revolt which we create in our 250,000 Sepoys. Less than 15,000 Europeans iu Bengal will have successfully put dowvn these deeply organized mutinies, although with more courage and determination on the part of the mutineers, and less energy and decision on ours, all Bengal might now be in the hand of the native army and the disaffected population If such a forco should accomplish this in the face of such difficulties, bow comparatively eas will it b4 for uis to hold Bengal wrhen none of these elements of weakless and disaffection exist ? The remedy is simple and should be promptly applied. 1. Disband every regiment of the Bengal army that did not manifest in the late mutiny shrong feelings of loyalty. 2. Cease recruiting in the remaining regiments of the Line. 3. Increase vour Irregulars from the Ghoorkas, Slkhs, and Beloochees. 4. In addition to the 14,000 men now being despatched to India let your China force follow on when they have cornm pleted their work in China. 5. Cease recruiting for the native army in the three Presidencies until It has fallen to such a numerical strength as, including Irregulars, will not exceed 80,000 men. 6. Contemporaneously with this augment your European force, until in the three Presidencies they reach 80,000 men. This may be the work of a few years, but should ba the plan nowr initiated and steadily pursued. 7. Your entire force, European and native, would thus be reduced from upwards of 300,000 men to 160,000; they would be maintained at reduced cost, they would be infinitely more efficient and trustworthy than your present force, and on the completion or part completion of your system of railways you could detach from India to Europe on the occasion of hostilities, a seasoned, practical, and efficlent army of from 30,000 to 40,000 men, to be replaced by recruits from this side, instead of recruiting, as in the case of the Crimea, for the seene of action with such hazardous and doubtful results. The reserve force in India would be nearly as available for continental warfare as troops in this countrv ; you would be enabled to reduceyour force and camps here, and economy and efficiency to India and this country would be secured Yours obediently, House of Commons, July L 2r. P. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES. Sir,-Among the many s rmises as to the causes of the recent outbreak in the Bengal army I do not observe any allusion made to the late stringent orders issued to medir- committees annually assembled for the purpose of inva. liding native commissioned, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of that army. I have not these at hand to refer to. but, their purport and effect being very clearly impressed upon my memory, with your p:rinission I shall endeavour to state them as concisely as possible, in the hope that through your powerful aid the ventilation of the subject may induce the cancelling of orders which, in my humble opinion inflict great injustice on all ranks of the native soliery of Bengal, who, as is their woont, have only, I think, been waiting for a colourable pretext to show their teeth. I conceive the existence of such orders quite sufficient to account for the sulk-y, indifferent kinEd of feeling which for some years past has been observed in the native army. The invaliding orders I have referred to were, I think, first issued in 1853. They were, I knovv, in full operation in 1854 when I rejoined my regimert. Their purport was that anj native soldier of whatever rank or length of service who. though incapable of field service, was thought equal to cantonment duty should on no account be invalided-that is be allowed to return to his home on a monthly stipend, varyingaccording to his rankorleongtl of service, beirgliable for no further duty. In my own regiment we have havil. dars (sergeants) of 40 years' Eervice; and the last mnster roll I signed the strength of my connpar,y bore upon it, I think, five full privates of 20 years eervmce. To show the effecb of buch orders I will give you the case of one of these havildars. How hard they hit all ranks vwill be clear to every one, soldier or civilian, without my entering into a long detaiL The case is no exceptional one, further than that the individual was very far superior in intelligence to the g'neral run of our men. This man was a pay-sergeant when r first joined myregniment, sotne 20 years ago, a first-rate drill, and of first-rate character and conduct-a 3ajpootby birth. A fter an absence of some years I returned to mv regiment, when, as is customary, a ntmber of native officeis aiud mnen came to see me. I remarked the absence of this man, but said nothing. Shortly afterwards I met hima on the load. " Holloa, So-and-So ! vhy did not you come and see me this morning with the others; and what have you teen about that you are still a havildar ?" The tears came into tbe poor old fellow's eyes. " What can I do, Sir? Disgraced a,d passed over for promotion, how could I come and p%y my respects to you *' In a conversation too long to write I first learned the facts. He had been sent before the Invaliding Committee, his surgeon, his adjutant, and his commanding-officer signing and entering upon his roU that he wos lame, worn out, and unfit for further service. The committee, following these *rderm returned him as fit for cantonment duty. His turn for promotion shortly arrived. The commauding officer did notfeel himnselfjustified in promoting a jemadar, a man whom a short time before he had retured as lame, worn out, and unfit for service. Hinc ilcc, &c. The burden of the poor old boy's plea was, "If I am fit for service, promote me; if not, pension me, as thousands of others bave been before me. Why should I be disgraced when every sabib in the reginient knows what I am and have been ' That there are many cases in every regiment as bad as the above I do not doubt, cud any one wvith half an eye can see what a fruitful source of discontent and disgust such an order must be, and how impossible it is for even that hroad.shouldered scapegoat the regimental officer to deal with such cases in a manner ikely to preserve the character of his Government for justice, and his own for common sense and feelingtowards his men, SOOKH0 SuNJ.
THE LIrVnPooL ToNw' Cou-CIn, xWD THIE A:Ey CONISERVAN;CY BILL.-LiVBRPOOL July 1.-The monthly meeting of the council was held this morning, ldr. F. Shand, the mayor, presiding. Mr. Woodruff, one of the members, asked for some information as to the state of affairs before the Parliamentary committee on the KIersey Conservancy BilL He did not a for the parps of oforcin a discassion, but was aware that certain changes were abcat to be made which woluld deprive the council of a largo amount of income (100,0001. ayear), in a manner unconstitutional and unjust. The lMayor observed that the state of mnattere before the committee had been already made publio by the newspapers, and he did not consider it desirable at this juncture to go beyond that. He observed, however, that he had received a telegraphic notice frorn the town-dcerk (Tr. Shattleworth) stating that they had themselvea withdrawn froma the further consideration of the commltteo in the matter, and that they could not interfere in the furtherproceedins in the House of Commons in any;way to prejudice thel ture conuse in the Upper House. The town-clerk had fuarther stated that certain proceedings, negotations, or arrange. ments had beea suggested in a particular quarter. ani had req,uested that tbe Birkenhead conunittee of the council wonld proceed to London inmmediately to tak;e the lnatter into consideration, The council aeona afterwards abrnUDty adjourned, in order that the commjitee might proree! tc
JiONBY-MARBKBTaad CITY INTGLLWGBNOC. Wednesday Evening. The expectation that the first elleut of the Indian expenditure consequent upon the mutiny would be in favour of the Lundon mnouey-snarket rather than against it has been confirmed, the India-house having to-day lowered their rate for dratights on the several Presidencies. The reduction at present is limited to 1 per cent., but if this should fail to iaduce remitters to purchase bilis instead of sending s Iver, a further alteration will doubtless soon tollow. The vigorous measures adopted by the Company will necessitate large disbursements here, which in the absence of any extraordinary means ! can be provided for only in this marner. The English funds opened heavily this morning, but remained without increased depression until near the termination of business, when bad accounts from the Paris Bourse led to several speculative sales. Consols for the 9th inst. were first quoted 92j to S, and the last transactions were at 92g to i. Money was in fair supply on Government securities at 6 per cent., and in the dibcount-market and at the Bank there was an absence of pressure. :Bank Stock closed at 212r to 214; Reduced, 92ff to i ; New Three per Cents., 92i to j; Exchequer Bonds, 98 to 7s; India Bonds, 10s. to Us. discount; and Exchequer-bills, Us. to 2s. discount. Foreign securities were generally firm, but the recent advance in Peruvian was not fully supported. The various operatiouis comprised-Danish Three per Cents, 85i ; ditto Five per Cents., 102; Granada, 23; Peruvian, S0O, 7 9i; ditto Three per Cents., 55-, 54.; Russian loiur-and-a-Half per C'ents., 96; S'ardinian, S9Q, i, 90, 89-j; Spanish, 4Thj; ditto l)eferred, al5~; ditto Certificates, 6 ; Turkish, 95k, i, #, and 96; Dutch Two-and-aHalf per Cents., G4; and the Foar per Cents., 98i and 9)8. The corn-nmarket this morning was without alteration. The uninterrupted depression on the Paris Bourse is beginning to 'excite uneasiness, from the supposition that there must be some cause for it beyond what appears upon the surface. Under ordinary circumstances the idea would arise that a fresh loan is contemplated, but the positive statement of the Finance Minister that no such aid would be required this year, and the fact that the Bank of France is pledged to supply 4,000,0001. in 1858 or 1859, seem to preclude that solution. This evening the final quotations of the Three per Cents. were GOf. 95c. for money, and OOf. 80c. for the present account, showing a further fall of five-eighths percent. Probably in the arrangement of the liouidation a large number of weak holders have been obliged to close their transactions, in 'which case au early rebound may be expected. Prices are now at their lowvest point since the beginning of the year. This state of things having occurred when the prospects of the grain harvest and the vintoge surpass all recent experience it is not difficult to form a conjecture of the crisis that =nust have been witnessed if ia these respects there had been another failure. The probability of an immediate further reduction in the Bank rate of discount was discussed today, the total of bullion being now about equal to that held when the rate was reduced, to 5 per cent. in Mty, 1856. On the Stock-Exchange the expectatiou seemed to be that no chaDge would take place, at all events for another week, but out of doors the fact of the discount-houses having refused to receive six months' deposits, for which a few days back they were willitng to allow 5- per cent., at a higher rate than 5 per cent., created a contrary impression. Only a trifling amount of foreign gold was sold to the Bank to-day, but it is stated that sovereigns continue to be sent from Scotland. The Vanderbilt, from New York to-day, has brought 170,0001., a considerable portion of which is oa French account. The Atlantic has also arrived with 225,0001. There was continued depression in the stock-market. Erie had fallen to S01, and Reading to 71k. Illinois Central stood at 32z pm. The cotton and grain markets were unchanged. The West India steanier Magdalena to-morrow will take out 35,2761., chiefly iu gold. The Cape steamer Armenian carries 60,0001. on Govermment account. At a meeting of the Eastern Steamship Company to-day it was announced that the vessel may be laumched in September, but that the trial trip to Portland, Maine, will be deferred to the April following. Her total cost will amount, including all contingencies, to 597,1951., of which 190,0001. remains to be met. Of this 92,0001. will be provided by calls at present in arrear, and to supply the balance of 98,0001. the directors were empowered by the meeting to borrow 100,0001. upon debentures. The Peninsular and Oriental Company have notified to-day tbat a deduction of 25 per cent. will be made in their rates of passage money for aU oflicers on unexpired furlough compelled to return to India during the next two months. It is said that the number on furlotugh is 800. Joint-stock dishonesty seems to be zuiversal. Canada has now contributed her share to the general disclosures, and it is fully equal to the French, American, and English specimens. For some years a variety of intrigues have been notoriously in progress to bring about certain railway combinations, in which the Great Western of Canada line had a primary interest ; and at length they have exploded in a way that bas spread universal scandal. A Parliamentary committee has been sitting at Toronto upon one of the cases, which is said to be nothing more than a sample of the whole, and their report exhibits practices on the part of some of the gentlemen who have claimed to take the lead in these undertakings on the very score of personal character, which may well awakern doubts as to the safety of any speculative secutities depending upon the integrity of the class of which they have been prominent meembers. The NVoodstock and Lake Erie . Railwav and Harbour Company was projected in 1847, with a capital of 250,0001., but it remained dormant till 1852. In that year the directors resolved to obtain the co-operation of some of the principal municipalities connected with the route, and employed two agents for the purpose. To induce loans and subscriptions, these agents were charged to represent that the whole of the stock had been taken bytresponsible persons, who were willing to admit the municipalities to a participation; that no moneys the municipalities might furnish would be expended until aU the means for completing the works were in hand; and that a contract had been 3nade with Mr. Zimmerman which fully secured that end. The municipalities, deceived by these representations, which were accompanied by the usual flourish " that the position, character, and standing of the board of directors furnished the best guarantee for the honourable discharge of their duties," readily advanced the sum of 145,0001. From that time to the present, however, little progress has been made, and, suspicions having been aroused, a 'committee of the louse of Assembly was obtained, who last month delivered' a report, ehowing a course of mendacity rarely paralleled, deploring that its perpetrators are individuals wvho " have hitherto occupied high and honourable positions in society and in public station," and expressing a hope, like that entertained here in the case of the Royal British Bank, that the law as it stands may be found sufficient by the legal advisers of the Crown to enable punishment to be inflicted, and that, under any circumstances, measures may be adopted to prevent similar d-elinquencies for the future. It appears that, instead of a large subscription having been made for the stock, not a single shilling had been taken beyond some amounts barely sufficient to qualify the directors, and that upon these not more than 501. had ever been paid by any of the parties. Sham holders, however, were created, and the directors actually caused not only their own election to be made On these fictitious votes, but when a quarrel subsequently took place among them each party fought against the other with these pretended weapons, both apparently consenting to recognize them as valid. Their dissensions were also followed by Chancery suits, the whole expenses of which were paid out of the 145,0001. contributed by t1he unfortunate municipalities, the com.j t having from the first been wholly de6ti) of any other funds. In one case a municipal officer, baving doubts as to Ihe good faith of the directors-, hesitated to give them the necessary papers to enablethem to obtain the Government debentures which were to represent the subscription of his township, To this personage 2001. was eentin sealed envelopes, and his scruples were quieted. One of the directors, Mr. Eenry De Blaquiere, for his inluence-and exertions in obtaining the contraot for Zimmeirman and Co. is, accordin8 to the report of the committee, " distinctly proved to have received a bxibW1O,O9 .," while it als Appe U*t waw to be a secret partner, and to get a fifth of the profits. This contract, however, was only partially carried out. After 70,0U00. had bern paid to Zimumerman and Co. for works which it seems had been executed by sub-contractors for 32,0001. the whole undertaking came to a stand. Notice was then given that the charter for the enterprise had passed Pato the hands of Mr. Isaac Buchanan and others, c)aiming to be directors. Mr. Buchanan had forrmerly been a great opponent of the road, but upon his examination by the comrmittee the secret of his change of position was revealed. lir motive was to obtain the control of it for the Great Western of Canada, and his mode of EeCUring that result, although singularly successful, the committee trust, "for the honour of public men and the sake of morality, is one seldom resorted to." It simply consisted in giving a bribe of 20,0001. to obtain the removal of three of the directors, and the substitution of nominees of his own. Mr. De Blaquiere again is one of the principal persons who figmre in this transaction, and a "M Mr. Vanvoorhies, as negotiator between the parties, received for his services an undertaking that he should have a preference contract of 35 miles of road." Even these new arrangements, however, resulted in nothing beyond the specified division of spoil, and the murnicipalities therefore appear to have had little left to look to, except the satisfaction of a judicial exposure. It is to be hoped that the benefit of that exposure will be properly appreciated on this side. It is for the London market that all the debentures, preference shares, and other securities that are to float these concerns are manufactured, and the ambition of a large number of the " honourables" of the province is that they may be selected for a mission to oLor capitalists with a pocket full of them. In the present case, among the claims of Mr. Buchanan on the road is one of 3,0001., being, in the words of the committee, "for law and C]hancery costs, and expenses of trips of himself and others to England." At any given moment there are always probably fifty or a hundred of such negotiators from Canada or the States actively at work tbroughout the country. They are almost all honourables-that is to say, members of Congress or Assembly-and vith equal uniformity are among the first financiers of the place whence they are accredited. They come with prodigal orders to ironmasters contingent upon their bonds being disposed of, and are therefore not without English help. Commissions of 10, 20,or even 30 per cent. on all the money they may obtain reward them for their zeal, and for the past 10 years the trade has been a distinguished and prosperou5 one. The results to the investors form at this moment part of the private sorrows of many an English family. lNevertheless the occupation is far from having been extinguished. Hence the desirableness of calling attention to the above details. They may meet the eye of country gentlemen just about to close an eager purchase of 7 per cent. bonds, redeemable ten years hence, with all kind% of wonderful options, and perhaps interpose a salutary check. In most cases, however, it will probably be at the cost of some pain, in disturbing an enthusiastic conviction, forced upon them by the eminent orator "who happens to be on a tour through Europe, and who has taken charge of this little affair on his way," that the projected line traced on the map before them would inevitably form a chief link of every other line already in existence, and absorb all the lake traffic from Ontario to Superior.

RAILWAY AND MINING SRARBS. Wednesday Evening, The railway-market was steady to-day, and such slight alterations as occurred in the English descriptions were mostly in a favourable direction. French were heavy, and were generally qu6ted at a further decline. In East Indian there was no fresh alteration, and miscellaneous were likewise without movement. On the whole, the market is remarkably free from signs of weakness, and but for the Indiau news and the persistent fall on the Paris Bourse a decided improvement, especially in guaranteed descriptions, would most probably have been witnessed during the past week.

WIND CHLATs.-We recommencd to all shipowners the purchase of the charts lately prepared by Government, slhowing the prevailing winds of the great oceans. A sbort time only is necessary to snake any intelligent shipmaster familisn with the mode of applying the information they contain, which may be the means of shortening very much the duration of extended voyages, such as to India, Australia, &c. The principle adopted is very simple though much trouble and a careful examination of ships' Elegs was necessay before the results could be arrived at. Our readers will better understand these charts by a short explanation being given. Suppose a point taken on the Atlantio Ocean, the next process is, bymeans of all the records to be met with, to ascertain the direction of the wind at this point during the year; this being ascertained, a line is drawn which not only shows the direction, but the duration and the months in which it prevails. Other winds are taken in like manner, until a star is formed on the chart, a glance at which onables the mariner to ascertain that, on an average of years, at certain periods, tho wind blows in one are tor a certain period. The chart bein- covered with such stars, it is only necessary to find out t'he point where the proper wind Is to be met with to enable a mastertomake an almost certain passage at any season. In the case of avessel doubling the Cape of Good Hope the chart at onoe, according to the season, shows the very Ime in which the fair wind may be expected; so that if there be two vessels, the one furnished with a chaxt and the other depending on the chance of a wind, it will occr that while the one is becalmed, or baffled by a head wind, the other, by keeping a little more north or south, as instructed by the wind chart, may not require to alter a sail for days at a time. We earnestly re. commlend our ahipowners in the foreign trade to furnish their ships wdit these charts, which, we have no doubt, will bo found tocoause snch * saving of timeuwill insrease th8 relative profit on the freights.-Belfat Jficrcentile Jous-u.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY. LicoLNs-INm. JULy 1. GORDON V. T.OWIV (Before the LORD CHAIxLLOi.) This was an appeal from an order of the 3Master of the Rolls overrnling oertain exceptions to the Ilaster's report. The point raised for the decision of the Court was whether am executor, who had Paid to hig own father a sum of money due to him on the balance of account of a partnership between him and the testator, was entitled to his discharge pro taeto out of the testator's agsets, the estate being a defI. cient one. The Master, in tuking the accounts, allowed the discharge, and the Master of the Rolls overruled the excel. tions to his fnding. The question was of no general interest. Mr. lAoya and Mr. Mnrtineau were for the appellnts; Mr. R. Palmer and Mlr. Renshaw for some of the respondents, and Misr. Selwyn and Mr. Terrell for the remaina.r. The LOBD CuAeCExLOR dismissed the appeal, but, in consequence of some peculiarities in the case, without costs. (Before the LoRDs JusTicEs or APP.) BUSTES OF THE COURT. Lord Justice ENIGRsT BRUcE said that it might be con. venient to the bar to know that the Lords Justices would not be able to sit on Saturday, as they would be engaged at the Judicial Committee of the Privy CounciL They would, however, sit in this court all next week and the earlier part of the following week; after whicb, for a few days, the business of the Judicial Committee would be resumed. I1N LDFACY. Their Iordships disposed of a somewhat unusually long list of 13 lunatic petitions, none of which require nolcoe excepting W; RE UOBLYN. Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Humphrey appeared in support of this petition, which was presented for the parpose of obtaining the issue of a comtnisalon ee luucatico engeeuireado against r. Deoeble Peter Hoblyn, a gentleman of independenb pro, perty in the county of CornwalL. The evidence for and against the application is conflicting, and as the case is not concluded it seems more proper to defer a report. The Attorney-General, Mr. Cairns, and Mr. Amphlett appear in opposition to the petition. The argumentKs will be resumued to-morrow (thisi day).
t VICE-CHANCEI3jORS' COURTS. JtULY L WALLIS V. MELL. (Before Vwtce*OkanceMor Sir Jom STUArT.) the principal questions in this case were whether under the circumstances proeyd Wiliam Canning, the son of the testatrix Athaliah Canning, was to be presumed to be dead, and if so, at what time his death was to be presumed to have taken place, and also whether he was to be presnmed to have died without i-gne. It appeared in evidence at the orginal hearing of the cause in 1T5, that in August, 1841 Williar Canning, being then a bachelor, left England for New Orleans, in Americas, and that since that period he had not returned to this country, nor had any communication been received from him; and the Court directed an ino whether he was living or dead, and if dead, wheni he ai and whether he left any issue. The chief clerk, by his certiScate which was novw before the Court, certi6ed that various advertisements had been inserted in public papers circulated in different parts of America, requiring William CaDnin or his child, children, or issue (if any), living at his deata (if dead), and the legal personal representative and representatives of such of them (if any) as were dead, by a day therein named, and long since, to come in. No person had come in under these advertisements. Beyond that, no evidence further than that adduced at the hearing was now brought before the Court. MIr. %hebbeare appeared for the plaintiff, and lIr. Hardy for the defendant. The Vrcx-CAxcRiLint declared that William Canning was to be presumed to be dead, and without leaving isse but declined to fix the period at which his death was to be presumed to have taken place.

COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH GUIrDnLILL. JULY L DACEY V. THE SOlMT-EASTlN tATLWATY COMPANV- (Sittings at Niist Prius. before Lord OAAsPrRLL.I -Lms was an acctiol t which the plpintiff, a boy aged 12 Years, by his next friend, sued the South-Eastern Railway Company to recover damages for an injury of a permanent nature which be had sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendants' carmen in driving a van up a narrow street narned Middlesex-street, In WhitechapeL The jury, after being locked up for several hours last night, found a verdict for the defendants, as stated in our report of the caae which appeared in Thc Tinmes this morming, At the Sitting of the Court this day, Lord CAMPBRnELL read a paper which the jury had handed in to the officer of the Court, and which ran thus:- "Yor the defendants.-the evidence not clealy showing that the elal5utid was knocked down by the vaggon; but the Jury desir to erpes their opinion that the moet culpable negilgence was shown by the carmen In charge. " The jnry also consider It desirable that Mddlesex-stect shla not be vaaRed through by such ponderous vehleles." HiS LosiDsup observed that if the jury had simply found their verdict for the defendants he should not have interfered, as the question was entirely for the jury, and whatever might have been his (Lord Campbell's) own cpinion, he could not have said the jury were wrong. But as the jury, in inding their verdict for the defendants, had expressed their opinion that "the moat culpable negligence was shown by the carmen in charge," his Lordship directed that execu- ion should he stayed, andthat the matter should be broueht befoxe the Coulrt. With respect to the suggestion that Md. dlesex-street ahould not be passed through by such ponderous vehicles, his Lordship thought the sentiment expressed by the jury wiaS most unexceptionable. Mfr. Serisant BA rAu'nux, the counsel for the pliSntif subsequently entered the court, and applied to be allowed to takre a copy of the verdict. Lord CAni'EL.-O1m, certainly. EL=XS V. MURFHY. Mfr. IL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Hannen, appeaed for the plaintiff; and Mr. H. Hill, Q.C., and Mr. J. Brown for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, Edward Eldins, was an attorney, who sued the defendant, George Murphy, a tax collector and house agent, in St. Pancras, to recover damages for a breach of warranty. The defendant denied that he had given any warranty, aid he also pleaded that he was authorized to give it. It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that on the 21th of February, 1853, he was induced to enter into a contract with the defendant to purchase a house, No. 21, Glocesterroad, Regent's Park,upon receiving a distinct assurance that he was authorized by the proprietor, Mr. Toleman, to sell the house for the sum of 2,050. It turned out that Mr. Toleman repudiated the act of his agent, the defendant, and had sold the house at an earler hour on the same day for 2,1001. to Mr.Roxburghe, a Chancery barrister, who had a lease of the house. The plaintiff upon this filed a bill in Chancery against Mr. Tolemrn for the specific performance of the agreement, and, by direction of the Master of the Rols, an action was afterwards tried in this courtto asceraLin whether or not the present defendant had Toleman's authority to enter into the agreement on his behalf. Toleman denied that he had given the defendant any authority to sell the property without reference to him, and certainly not for a less amount than 2,1001. The jury found their verdict in favour of Toleman, and thus negatived the defendant's authority. The present action was then brought, and the plaintiff now sought to recover asdamagesthecoststo which he had been put in endeavouring to compel Toleman to complete the contract which the defendant had entered into in his name. Mr. Toleman was examined in support of the plaintiff's case and repeated the evidence given on the former Mr. HILr said the defence was, first, that Mr. Toleman had authorized the defendant to drop the price from 2,1001. to 2,0501.; and secondly, that he (the defendant) had been induced by the plaintiff to sign the agreement by the assurance, after an explanation of all the circumstances, that he (the defendant) had authorlty, and that he could come to no harm by Bigie. Mr. CHAmE cs caged evienco in reply-to the defendant's case, and contended that the evidence which the defendant had given in Chancery contradicted that which he had given to-day. Lord CAMPBELL, in summing up the evidence, said he thought that the jury would probably be of opinion that the former Jury and tho Vice-Chancellor had properly decided that Mr. Toleman had not given the defendant absolute authority to sell the house for 2,0501. However, the jury must decide that question, and they must also decide upon the evidence whether or not tho defendant told the plaintiff that he had Toleman's authority to sell the property for that amount. His Lordship particularly called their attention to the affidavit made by the defendant in Chancery, in which he had sworn to that effect. His lordship Eaid that if the plaintiff had bonu fideX incurred the costs of the suit in Chancery on the representation made by the defendant that he had such authority, he was entitled to recover them in this action. The jury retired to consider theirnverdict; and upon their return into court, at 5 o'clock, they stated tHat they could not agree, and there was no probability of their doing so. Lordl CA bPe LL again explained to them the two questions which they had to determine, and said they muast nain retire to consider their verdict. The foreman of the jury said that, in order tobethere in time this morning, he had left his home at Hampstead without his breafast; nd he thought it very hard that he should be detained any longer, more especially as the jury had fully considered the questions,and there was not the least probability of their COmiDg to an agreement. After some further discussion, Lord CAIrxPBE. said that if both parties would agree, he would discharge the jury. llr. Han, on the part of the defendant, consented to this proposal, but the plaintiff would not consent. Lord CAPBZLL said he had no powrerto relieve the jury; hut ultimately his Lordship, with the consent of the parlies, fordehred tthat, they should be allowed to have " moderate refreshment."~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~re The jury were then locked up for the night. DlPF V. DBLAisOTIu AND OTHERS. M1r. H. Hill, Q.C,, and Air. Blaiae appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. AXL Smith, QC., and Mr. T. Jones for the defendants. This wasan action in which the plaintiff songhtto rooover damages for the infriungement of his copywright in a work entitled Practice of Jotography, written by the plaintiff, but published with the name of " Philip H. Delamotte" as author.; B consent of the parties the cause was tried by Lord Campbell without a jury; but as his Lordship, after hearing the evidence, said he would tke the documents home with him for perusal before giving his decision, we defer our report. } ~~SECOND COUIRT. (Bcforc Mfr. Justtce Em:= and Common .Turws.) PINNIS V. THE COLONIAL FBItE COMPANY. Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., and Mr. Malcolm were counsel for the plaintiff; the Hon. G. Denman appeared for *e defendants. Tbe plaintiff is a provision merchant, at 58, Fenchich- street, and the action was brought to recover half-a-year'i rent up to Lady-day of offices occupied in his house by the defendants. It appeared that in Junte, 1855, the _plintiff's attention was attracted by an advertisement for offices for. publiccompany. Hecomnuniatedwith Mr. Shaipe, whowas secretary and promoter of the company, and they eventuay took possession of the offices. At Mlchaelmas, 1856, three. quarters' rent was due. The plaintiff vwas forced to take legal proceedings to recover it. The roney was at length paid, bUt 8barpe insisted on obtaining a receipt in his own Dame. For the defence it was contended that Sharpe was alone responsible, and he had no authority to bind the company. The charter, dated the 10th of July, 1856, incorporate. Sharpe and such other persons as should take shares as a. comnpany for the purchase of estates in Jamaica and Britieh Guiana, and the cultivation and purchase of Sbrous plants, and obtaining therefrom the valuable fibres which they contain, and for convertingthe sahe into certaiu mnarketable products. No shares had ever been xUotted, but several apno plications had been received. Mr. G. B. Young. Mlr. Cowan, and some other gentlmen were ads'ewtised as directors. Mr. Justice EnrzsLaaid he would hold that fromn the times the charter ws granted to Sharpe he had authority to bind. the company, but there was no evidence to showv that any of .he gentlemuen named wrere members of it when Sharpe toole thrtcifo plaintiff,-Damages, 731. iSs. BROWN V. DAVIS. Mr. awkins and Mr. Barnard were couael for the plain. tia, and MIr. D. D. Keane appearedfor the defendant. This was an action for breach of a warranty of a horse. The plaintiff is a money-dealer and chymical manure manufacturer, residing at laling, having a office in the city. The defendant is a pablican and horse-dealer at Peterboxough. In January Irathe was in London with some horse The plaintiff was introduced to him, and offered to purchase a hay mare if defendant would take some hops in exchange. The defendant consented, and it was arranged he should get 601. worth of hops for the horso and 141. in cash. The receipt warranted the mare " sound and quiet to ride and drive." About four days after plaintiff drove the mare np to London, and sent her back to Baling by his groom. When the man got to Acton Bottom he found the mare wr- dead lame. She was taken to a veterinary surgeon and found to have sprung a eurb and to have an enlarged hock. The defendant refused to take her back. She was sold at Tattersal',, and only fetched 20 guineas. The plaintiff stated that when his attention was called to the mare by his groom he found the hock was much en^ larged, and there was the .ark of an old blister on the r,pot. Cross-examlned.-The defendant offered to take back the horse and retam the hos if he would give him 51. or 101. in addition to the 141. There were 28 owt. of hops. They were hope of 1855. The plaintiff's groom stated that when he sav the mare the first evening she came he remarked an enlargemeDt of the hock. Mr. Field, veterinary surgeon in Oxford-street, stated, when he examined the mare, on the 7th of February, sah had a curb of the near hock, and an enlargement of the spavin place of the near hock, and that the curb was not of a recent date, but was at least of three or four weeks standing. The defence was that the mare was perfectbly sound when sold, and that the curb was produced by some shockreceivecl when under the care of the groom, which might easily have occurred. The defendant stated he had got the mare from a French dealer named Dumage the day before he sold her to the plaintiff. Ho examined her, and she had no sign of a curb, nor any blemishe3. She had been fresh clipped, and any mark would have been visible. When he saw the plaintiff some days after he told him a curb was a matter which might occur at any moment, but if the mare was pronounced unsound he was quite ready to take her back and return the hops. Augustus Dunage stated that when he exchanged the mare with defendant she had no curb nor blemish. Hle had bought her in London about a fortnight before. Bo had paid 201. for her. John MSason, assistant to Dumage, declared that when sold. to defendant she had no symptoms of a curb. JohnSivers, foreman to Mr. Dyer, stated he had exanined the mare, as his master was anxious to buy. She had no sign of a curb. It was further proved that the mare had since been sold. for 30 guineas to a M. Johnson, a surgeon. She has got a mark of a curb, but works very welL. Er. Jusice EuRIZ having summed up, The jury found a verdict for t~he defendant.

Upon searching the prisoners' apartment he found a checkbook belonging to the london Joint-Stock Bank with some of the checks taken out.

Abrawham Mfeldola, chymnlst and druggist, of Leman-street, Whitechapel, appeared before Mr. SELFE to answer a summons taken out by Mir. Samuel Jessop Bureb, the resident medical officer of the London Hospital, and which charged tho defendant with seling to the late fildiam B ash four ounces of arsenic, the same not being miced with soot or indigo in the proportion specified in the ld section of an Act for egulatmig the sale of arsenic, the 1ath of Victoria, chap. 13. -ca. alrch wished to state that a man, who gave the name of Wiliam Bush, was brought tothe London Hositala few days ago poisoned by arsenic, from the effect of which he die a few minutes after his awdmission. The attention of the hospital anthorities had been most particularly calledsto that case and they, thought great blame attached to the defendant, rho had sold four ounces of arsenic to the deceased without the preeence of a witness, and without complying with any of the forms prescribed by law. The hospital authorities q3 ad no vindictive feeling to gratify, and had no wish that the full penaty of 20a . should be iundicted on the defendant. Mr. S amuel RLyan , surge on, o f Lem an -stre et, White.- chapel, said he was called upon to atteod a mnan named tiatiane Bush, at 96, Leman-street, on the 20th of Jane, and found him labouting under the efifets of poison. The patient saud he had been en two large tablespoonfuos of arsenie. Mr. Burch eaid the deceased Bush was brought to the f ondon Hospital at the time in question, and died a few minutes afterwards. His sudden death was caused by arsenic, of which he had taken very nearly, if not quite, an ounce The paper now produced by MOr. Ryan contained three ounces of solid arsenic. It was uncoloured. The defendant stated at the inquest held upon the body of the deceased that he had sold a quater of apound ofwhite oarsenic to him. The defendant also pleaded ignorance, and said that although ho had beon in business 40 years he was not aware of the existence oE an Act regulating the sale of arsenic, and '}hot sooner than such a thing should happen again he would destroy a-ll the poisons in his shop. Ir. hleldola.-Which I have done, MIr. SXsa-n fined the defendant -lOs. and costs. The penalty was instantly paid. SouD i CARk-RichardtCotterand William Jones, two smart-looking young fellows, well-known housebreakers, werecharged with breakinghinto th odwellinghouso of trs. a1argaret Richardson, at No. 59l, Bland-stteet, Great Dover road, and stealing therefrom a writinrg-desk and ceUaret. Jones was also charged with committing an outrageous assaulteupon Mre. Richardson, and threatening to murder herand her servant. The case having been proved, The Mlagistrate asked what was known of the prisoners ? Dennis Clarzk, 108 Hf, said that Cotter was tried at the 'Westminster Sessions in April, 1856, for housebreaking, and sentenced to 12 months' hard labour; Jones was ttied for and acquitted of burglary in May last; and they were both connected with a desperate gang of burglars. The prisoners, who did not deny the charge or the officer's statement, were fully comlnitted for trial, and all the witnesses were bound over to prosecute.
Tssx LONDON REFORSIATORY.-The annual meeting of this society was held yesterday, at Willis's Rooms, KRing street, St. James's. The Earl of Shaftesbary presided. The report embraced a period of two years. The building of the society was re-opened (after imdergoing works of enlargement) on the 11th of February, 1856. It is caloulated to accommodate 100 inmates; having workshops for the instruction of its recipients in carpentering, shoemaking, tailoring, and printing, and 10 rooms for solitary probation. The institute is for the reception of adulb male criminals. The object of the institution being to reform the criminal, great care is taken to ascertain whether there exists a desire to reform. A probationary period is applied to test the sincerity of the applicant; he remains in a smaU room alone, on bread and water diet, for 10 days. He may leave at any time; but if he stands the 10 dayes' test he is admitted into the institution. Emigration is the ultimate object; and the inmate having shown by his good conduct during 12 months that he may he trusted, he is sent out as an emigrant. Previously to tho reopening of the institution 174 were sent out as emigrants and 130 provided for in some other way. There were in the institution on the 31st of March, 1857, 79; 20 of whom were ticket-of-leave men, whose behaviour bad been very good. But the following table, showing how oftea each of the 180 who had been admittod since the reopening of the institution had been in prison, told a melancholy tale. Those committed once wvere 51 ; twice, 35; thrice, 14; four times, 24 * five ditto, 12 ; six ditto, 12; seven ditto, 5; eight ditto, 6; nine ditto, 5 ; ten ditto, 3; eleven ditto, 3; twelve ditto, 2; thirteen ditto, 1; fourteen ditto, 2 ; fifteen ditto, 1 ; seventeen ditto, 1 ; twenty ditto, 1 ; above ditto, 2. The society had received letters from several of the emigrants, giving a most gratifying account of their advancement in society, and expressing their deep sense of the essential benefits they had received from the institution. The following resolution was tben moved by Mr. John M'CGregor, seconded by Mtr. J. C. Wood, and carried unanimously: -"That this meeting regrets to learn that an institution so weU adapted for its object of reforming adult male criminals on their discharge from gaol should be suffering from want of funds." A second resolution was also adopted on the motion of the Rev. Mr. Minton, seconded by the Hon. F. Eyng, in these terms-"That the absence of pecuniary help from the Government (whose rules at present confine them to making grants to reformatory institutions for the young) aives the London Reformatory a peculiar claim on the voluntary liberality of the Christian public. After a few observations from the noble chairman in furtherance of the objects which the society sought to achieve, the meeting separated. TALO;vcHANDL,ERS' BEEVOoLENT SocIT9y.-O The anniversary festival of this society, established in th .ear 1843 with the object of relieving indigent and incapaci tated taUoowohandlers, their widows, and others connecteji with the trade, was celebrated last evening under most favourable auspices at the London Tavern, Lord John Russell presiding, supported by Mr. Sheriff Mechi, Mr. Whatman, M.P., Captain James, &c. There were also many ladies present. Upwards of 100 members of the trade sat down to an excellent dinner provided by Messrs. Chater and Co., the new proprietors. After the usual loyal toasts the noble chairman proposed " Prosperity and perpetuity to the Tallowehandlera' Benevolent Society," and stated that there had been elected upon the funds of the institutioa 97 persons, who had received among them no less a sum than 4,3801. 8s., showing an average distribution of 3271. annually since the formation of the society. At the present time there were upon the funds 28 men and 24 women, and he hoped that the increased contributions of the trade and the public would enable the trumtees of the charity considerably to extend tbe sphere of their usef.alness. "The health of the Chairman" was then proposed by Mr. Sheriff Meehi, and with the toast of "TRhe House of Commons" was associated the name of Mr. Whatman, ALP. Mr. lTorth, the hon. treasurer, announced subscriptions to the amount of DEATH Or LoRD FRANCIS GORDon .-WAe regret to learn that Lord Francis Arthur Gordon, while on his return home from the south of France, died on Friday last on the Continent.

IloYAx BoTA.rrc SocrISY.-Anotber exhibition of this society took place yesterday in their grounds in the Regent's Park.
