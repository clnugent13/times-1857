Eden, Commandant of the Garrison, acting for General Sir John F. Burgoyne, G.C.B. Inspector-Genenl of Fortifications. T1ha troops having been drawn u p in the barrack-square Colonel Eden inspected their clothing and necessaries, after 'which he minutely examined Brompton Barracks, the huts at Prince Henry's bastion, the barrack library, and the various offices In the afternoon the entire corps marched to Chatham lines, where they went through the manceuvres of a field-day in the prence of a large number of spectators The result of the inspectiou was very satisfactory. Aidischarge of troops to the number of 40 non-commis. cioned officer and men took place at Chatham yesterday. The Wincheeter, 50, vOaptain T. Wllson, late flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir MichaelSeymour, KO.B., on the China station, was paid off at Chatham yesterday, having been in commission upwards of five years, during the whole of which time she was stationed in the East Indies and Chins, until relieved by the Calcutts, 84, Captain W. K. Halls G.B. The Winchester brought home the crew of Her Majesty's sloop Bittern, 12, and also 89 sick and wounded invalids; 28 deatbs occurred on board during the passage home from Hongkong, which she left on the 13th of December. On the crew being paid off yesterday two silver medals, with gratuities of 151., awarded by the Admiralty for good conduct and meritorious service, were distributed to James Ramuplin, gunner's mate, and John Cornss quar termaster. The Admiralty also awarded gratnities for good conduct to Horatio. Wilson, captain's coxswain; Wi)liam Blake, chief boatswain's mate; and William Horn, coxswain of the barge. A few day s previously to tho vessel being paid oft Captain Wilson distributed about 200 medals to those men belonging to the Winchester and Bittern who were engaged in the attack on Rangoon. Letters from Her Mjestys steam troopship Transit were received at Portsmouth yesterday morning, one of which was immediately handed to our correspondent for publication. The last he published was said by its critics Lo have been written by a soldier " frightened at sea's alarms," and was stigmatized in various quarters as an "exaggerated" deacription of the ships voyage from Spithead and her condition on putting into Corunna, which "cuckoo cry" was re-echoed by the irst Lord of the Admiralty in the House of Commons this day week. The following is an extract fronm the letter of an experienced "blue jacket" of 20 years' servioe in varions parts of the world:- " Her Majesty's ship Transit, Cornnna, Apill 19. "Wecametoananchorhere this morning fromsheernecessity. From the time we left Spithead until this morning our ship has been one Fsene of misery-rolling awfully, Pitching tremerdously, the trcops' deck afloat all day and night, the decks not properly caulked, and expecting every moment to see the masts go over the side from the loose manner in which the rigging is fitted. They are now setting up rigging, and we shaU most likely get to sea to-night. We have met with heavy weather." By the Brazil mail, delivered yesterday, it would appear that the " unfortunate Transit " had crept as far as St. Vincent's by the 28th ult. The sailing three-decker Princess Charlotte, 104, Captain G. St. Vincent King, C.B., was taken out of dock at Portsmouth yesterday afternoo n and past under the sheara to be masted. Her rigging is ready for going over her mastheads. The M elville, 72, hospital ship for China, Commander Trollope, va taken into the steam lsin on Tuesday evening to ascertain if the leakage before reported was stopped; but as it proved unabated she was redocked on Wednesday for further examination. The Volcano ste anivessel, fitted as a seagoing smithery, Master-Commander Hockings, having been made ready for proceeding to China, is now reported to be in want of new boilers. The Beaver, 2, steam gunboat, Lieutenant Hewett, V.C., KLIA.., was taken into dock at Portsmouth yesterday to have defects repaired. The Agamemnon, 91, Commander Noddal (Master R.N.), commencedtakingin coal in the steam basin at Portsmouth yesterday, preparatory to proceeding to the Thames to ship her portion of the Atlantic Telegraph cable. The Malacca, 17, steam corvette, Captain Farquhar, does not go to Plymouth, but to Sheerness, to be paid off. She left Spithead yesterday. The Adventure, iron screw steam troopship, Commander Lacy, went out of Portsmouth harbour yesterday to test her machinery, &c. She will take in her portion of the troops for China next Wednesday. At the monthly examination of officers to qualify for promotion, and ofcaudidates for entry into the navy, which terminated yesterday at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth the following passed and received certificates:- Mates, R _.L, for Lieutenants, Messrs. F. R. Blackburne W. IL Heatoin, G. C. B. Wither. 0. Mitchell, J. M Stenart, JohS Liddwt; 0. H. Carpenter, L. ML Mallet, J. B. Waren and C. N. Streatfield. Second-Masters, R-., for Masters, Mesaa's C.

The 'Urgent arrived at Fayal, April 29, and was detained two days to perform quarantine. Since that time she has experienced strong easterly winds. Captain Scott, R.A, and family, have come home passengers in her. Corporal John Fowlern of the 67th, died at sea of consumption, April 26. The Urgent's engines were built for the Russian Govern. ment about three years ago, and are in a very defective state. The bearings become so much heated as to require a continuous and plentiful supply of water. 'Under full steam, in ordinary weather, her speed averages sight to eight and a-half knots per hour. The frigate Eurydice, 26, Captain Tarleton, appointed to Jeave Barbadoes on the 8th of April, the day after the 'Urgent, was spoken on Wednesday off Plymouth, 35 days ont, proceeding up Channel. The Cackoo, 3 gans, paddlewheel steamveseel, Lieutenant Commander Augustus G.

An Admiralty order was yesterday morning issued in Woolwich Dockyard to the effect that all applicants for admission as naval engineers, whether serving in the dockyard or factories, are to be examined by the surgeon of the flagship Fisgard or the surgeon authorized by the Commodore. The examination to take place 'after the candidate has bcen returned qualified in all other respects for appointment. The shafting and other, machinery for the screw steam corvette Challenger being built at Woolwich are ordered to be in readiness, as the vessel is in i forward state towards completion. The paddlewheel steam vessel Bastler, on service at Woolwich as tender to the Fisgard, is ordered to be admitted into basin to be supplied with a new boiler.

TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I venture, through your columns, to call the attention of the legal profeuion and of the public to a decision of the Court for Crown Cases Ieserved, reported in yoar impression of Tuesday last, which Ithink, and many others think with me, is no less opposed to the plain letter of the law than it is injurious to the maintenance of commnercial morality. The case was shortly this :-The defendant had offered somo spoons in pledge to a paivnbroker, representing to him that they were of the bet uality of plated spoons, "equal to Bikington's t A,"-a description importing that they were thickly coated with silver, and so had a com- I meremal value well known in the trade,belonging to the article so designated, and he had thereby obtained from the pawnbroker an advance of money the amount of which was calculated according to that description. In fact, the spoons were, to the defendant's knowledge, merely washed with silver and almost worthless. On this state of facts ten Juagesagainsttwe-thedimntientsbeingMr.Justice Wiles and Baron Bramwell, who protested in very energetic terms against the decision-held that the defendant had not committed any offence against the law under which hewas indicted-the 53d section of the IarcenyAct, the 7th and 8th of George IV., chap. 29. That la-w is inL these terms:-. Whereas a failure of Utice frequently aises from the subtle distinction betweea larceny and fraud, be it enacted, that if any person shall bY any false pretence obtsin from any other person ary chattel, money, or valuable security, 'With intent to chest or defraud any person of tbe same he shall be gailty of a misdemeanour, &ad punishable a3 therein mentioned." Can a plain man, not applying to the subject any faculty save that of endeavouring to understand plain words, doubt that alU the terms of this enactment were satisfied in the case referred to? The intent to defraud was clear, and was found by the -jury and admitted by the Court. Is it less clear that there was a fase pretence of an existing fact, namely, of the fact that the spoons were of a certain sptcified and recognized quality and composition ? Lord Campbell and his brethren of the majority say that it was "a mere representation, during the bargaining for the purchase of a commodity, of the quality of that commodity," and that "it never could have been intended by the Legislature to make ib an indictable offence for the seller to exaggerate the quality of the goods, any more than it could be made an indictable offence for the purchaser during the bargaining to depreciate the quality of the goods." This is merely playing with language. The Legislature has said, plainly enough, that he who fraudulently obtains money or goods by a false pretence-that is to say, by a wilfullyfalse statement as to an esisting fact-is an offender against this statute. In another case, decided the same day, the judges held unanw'.ously; and- without difficulty, that a man who sold 14 cwt. of coals, falsely representing them to be 18 cwt., and got tF-e price of 18 owt., was guilty of the offence derounced by this statute. Yet ten Judges the next moment hold that a m,.u who sells or pledges worthless metal, falsely representing it to be metal of a specaic quality and of far greater value, and so obtains a far greater sum than he would have obtained if he had told the truth, is not guilty of this offence. Mr. Justice Willes rightly said, that he could rot find in the statute any qualification of its terms in favour of commercial trickery ; and he aptly quoted an observation on this same subject of the late Lord Chief Justice Jereis-than whom no more honest and fearles3, as well as learned and able judge, had adorned the bench for many a day-that the habits and dealings of tradesmen ought to be made to bend to the law, and not the law to the habits and dealings of tradesmen. I also, Sir, protest respectfully against this decision, as being an unauthorized emasculation of aplain Act of Parliament; as holding out a premium to commercial immorality-which at present, Heaven knows, requires no such encouragemnent; and as tending to depreciate the character and authority of the Bench, who admit such considerations as el&menis of their judgments in the interpretation of a law framed for the safet of society against practices of the most mischievous character, and of the most lamentable frequency. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. A L&WYER I Templo, May 14.
C&PruRp or & SLAvER AT NEw Yore.-On Fridaymorning we briefly announced that the schooner Merchant had been seized, while putting out to sea, and biou3ht back to the city, on a chae of fitting out as a slaver. We have since learnt the particulars of the affair, from which it w.uld appear that the major hare of the story of this achievementis due to Captain Rynders,thenew United States' Marshal. Ever sinco his accession to offica he has not been slow to Inform all who exhibited the least inquisitiveness on the subject that he intended to discherge the obligations of his marsh-lship in the most impartial manner. In his own langna3e, he " was agoing to break up the slave trade In this port, sure; but althou%h he should catch slavers, and slaves too, whcuever it was bis duty to do it, he hoped that of the latter he should have as few cases as possible." About a week ago he obtained anopportunity to test the sincerity of his professions. Learnfg that a slaver was fitting out at pier 48, foot of Clinton-street, East River, he set about compassig her capture and condemnation. The suspected vessel proved to be the Echooner Merchant, Captain Strom, a Baltimore clipper, formerly employed in the coasting trade between New York and Richmond. TheMarshal and his nephew(oneof the deputies) kept her coastantly in view, watching her by turns night and day, and saw her take in a cargo of 140 casks, some of vwhich were filled with fresh, the rest with salt wa'er, besides beef, pork, rice, beans, flour, and Ilmber for a slave deck. To bettercarry out his plans, he dis,uised himself as a countryman on Wednesday night, and strolled on board a ship in the vicinity of the schooner. His supposod verdancy afforded much amusement to the ship's people. who laughed and joked considerably at his expense. After they bad somewbat tired of the fun, he carefuly inquired about the vessels lying around. They told him some pretty big yarns, but presently, pointing to a little schooner, said, - That feUow is a blackbird." "Sho, you can't come over me, yoa know; rm fly," said the Marshal. "I know blackbirds too well for that-have plenty whar I come from." They explained that they meant bim to urderstand by blackbird that this vessel was a slaver, about to depart for the cost to get a cargo of slaves. They then related to the supposed countryman a number of circumstances in relation to the schooner, many of which he knew from previous information to be true, and regaled him with some marvell-nstales about the slave trade. The Merchant cleared on Wednesday for Corsica, Africa, and the Mrrshal, procuring the necessary warrants, chartered the steamtag Satellite and put on board some of his deputies to assib Captain Faunce and his men in maldng the capture. He expected that she would sail on Thursday about 10 o'clock, and intended to join in the pur. suit, but during his teniporary absenoe she put off in tow of the steamer George Birkbeck, and of course the Satellite had to follow her without delay, leaving the Marshal beh-ud. The slaver was towed down near therevenue cutter, passing within a few rds, apparentl for the pmfposeof ascertaining whether a,e was suwpected. Everything, however, was 'aet on the cutter, and, seeing no prepartions to follow, re went on unsuspectingly. At Sandy Hook the steamer cas' off the schooner and returned towards the city, but no sooner had she left her than another tug, the Jolin Birkbeck, made for her and took her in iow. Steam was then crowded on the Satellite, and as she came within a short distance of the schooner the second steam-tnu cut off from her and steered away in a south-easterly direction. The schooner was speedilv overhauled and boarded 10 miles outside of Sandy Hook. The people on board instatlysub. mitted to their fate, and, leaving Captain Faunae in charge of the prize, Lieutenant Sanford took the Satellite ana wint in pursuit of the fugitive saeam-tug. After a smart chase he overhauled and seized her. Both vesselsgwere then brought up to the city and anchored under the guns of the revenue cutter Wsshington.-New York Triblaze. MURDER BY A Boy.-Yesterdav evening Mr. Myers, coroner, Preston, was to resume'an inquest at Kirkham-in-the-Fylde, about nine miles from Preston, upon the body of Betsy Titterington, aged 14, the diaghter of Jonathan Titterington. labourer, Kirkham. The girl had died from a wound inflicted with a knife by John Howell, aged 15, whose parents live in the samo village. The youth and the deceased were playing in the village street, with other children, about 7o clock on Tuesday evening, when a quarrel arose between two girls who had been fetching some water. One of them threw a stone, and according to the report, the lad HoweUw was annoyed. At that moment he was enaged incuttin t.-y called a " gineapig" or "cat," with a clasp kni4es and he suddenly turned round and struck Titterington. who was nearest to him, on the left side of the neck, inflicting a wound an inch and a-half in length, which bled profusely. He instantly decamped. The poor girl walked towards home-and sbe was then not far from it-untila she fainted, and she was then carried. She died almost immediately on reaching the house, without having given any account of the affair herself. Indeed, she never spoke after xa¢clog the house. Theinquest was onened on Wednesday evening. The mother was the only witness examined. She said that half an hour before the ocurrenoe she had seen her daughter getting her supper, in good health, laughing and The inquest ws aa(ourned for a postmortem examination; but it is the opimon of the surgeon who has been called in that death resulted from hemorrhagi.. The lad was searched for in vain by the police until 1 o'clock on the following (Wednesday) morning, when he gave him. self up and confessed that he had been in the fields all night.

PAIRLIA3ENTARY INTELLIGENCE, I HOUSE POF LORDS, THL-RsDAy, MkY 14. The LnxD CHAXCELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 6 o'clock. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH presented a Petition from the civil servants employed in the General legistry and Record-office for Seamen in favour of an alteration and amendment ofthe Superannuation Act. There was noth-tg in the petition, observed the noble ear], to distinguish it from those presented on previous occasions except that the first signature was that of Lieutenant Brown, the RegistrarGeneral of Seamen and Shipping, who was one of the ablest, most inteligent, and most zealous public servants he had ever had the good fortune to meet. He trusted the time was far distant when that gentleman would have occasion to apply for superannuation, but he felt satisfied that whatever retiring allowance mieht hereafter ba given to him it would not exceed the great value of his public services. Petitions to the same effect were presented by the Duke of NORFOLK and other peers. TE1E OPIU3f TRADE. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY recalled to the recollection of their lordships that at the close of the last Parliament he brought under their notice a series of questions relating to the opium trade, and the mode in which it was carried on by the East India Company. The result of the discussion upon that occasion was that the question of the legality of the traffic was referred to the law officers of the Crown, and he now wished to ask the noble and learned lord on the woolsack what progress had been made in the inquiry by those functionaries?' The LORID CHANCELLOR replied that, in coasequence of what passed when this subject was last before their lordships, he immediately communicated to his colleagues, and particularly to the President of the Board of Control, the questions snbmitted by the noble earl. As soon as the elections were over the President of the Board of Control lost no time in directing the proper officer connected with his department to draw up a case, stating the facts, that it might be submitted to the law officers of the Crown. That was done; but there was some difficulty arising from the circumstance that it was all-important that the facts should be stated accurately,-a task by no means so easy as might at first sight appear. The case, however, was drawn up, and it had now been transmitted by the President of the Board of Control to the COurt of Directors, in order that they might see whether, in their view, the facts were correctly given. It was at present in theirhands - but he believed thatl in the course of a few days it would be laid before the law offices of the Crown, for there was no reason to apprehend that the facts were inaccurately stated. THE CASE OF BEAWA.NNY L&LLAH. The Marquis of CL UN1RICARDE, in pursuance of notice, moved for the following papers :-Return of the anpointmnents held by Mr. Thomas in the civil service of the East India Company in the month of September, 1854, and of the appointments he may have since held up to the date of the latest accounts, distinguishing judicial frorm other apEointuients; also, copies of any correspondence that may bave taken place between the Governor or other superior authorities at Madras and Mr. Thomas relative to the case of " Bhawanny Lallah v. Thomas," and to the judgment dehivexed thereupon in the Supreme Court of Madras by Chief Justice Sir Cbristopher Xawlinson. The noble marquis Paid he bad to bring before their Lordships a case of injustice which if passed over without notice would be a di-grace to the British Crown, the British Parliament, and the Bsitieh nation. He knew nothing oi the gentlemanwho had such grave cause of complaint, but he know that this was not an isolated instance, and that the magisterial system of India, by placing despotic power in the hands of non-professional and unlearned men, subjectedthe natives of that country to tyranny and oppression unknown under any other Government in the world. The facts were briefly these :--3Mr. Thomas was a district collector and magistrate, and Bhawanny Lallah was a wealthy merchant and trader in the Eame district. On the 26th of September, 1854, Mr. Thomas sent a note desiring him to wait upon him next day; but, as Bhawanny Lallab would have had to go 60 miles and back again, he paid no attention to the note. During the absence of Mr. Thomas for two months justice was administered by two other magistrates, and no accusation was brought for non-compliance with Mr. Thomas's request. On the 14th of December Mr. Thomas returned. On the 22d of December notice was sent to Bhawanny Lallah to attend the court next day. He attended, and was told the case could not be heard then; he must come again next day. For 14 days the same thing occurred, and each day this gentleman was marched backwards and forwards, under the care of constables, without any charge being made against him. On the 6th of January there was an examination, of which no very exact account could be found, but the charge was then made of his being instrmmental in colecting a mob on the 3d of September, on the occasion of some Hindoo ceremony. Bhawamny Lallah denled that he was present in the town on the day when the mob was said to have been collected. On the 7th of January the depositions of the witnesses were read over, and a statement of what the accused had said, which he was asked to sign. He objected that he had not been allowed to put questions or examine witnesses, and refused to sian the statement, on the ground that it did not present a true account of what he had said. On his refusal he was taken to gaol and locked uP aU ilight without food. Next day on his iterated refusa1, he was told he would be sent bacs to prison for 20 hours'more solitary confinement, without food. Under the threat of starvation he consented to sign the paper, and was then told he was convioted and must pay a fine of 100 (or 200) rupees-101. (or 201.) His friends cffered to give security, The magistrate refused, and for 17 days and 18 nights the accused was kept in gaol, at theend of which time he was admitted to bail, the bail being only for 101. BhawannyLaUah brought the matter before the Supreme Court. HE was awarded 1,000 rupees, but a point which had been reserved on the trial was subsequently heard in the fuU court, and the result was that this man was left without any redress whatever, and was so until this day. Now, he (the :Marquis of Clanricardo) would ask their lordships if that was a state of thinsu becoming the British Crown or the BritishParliament? If this had been an isolated case it would not perhaps have been worth while to notice the aberrations of one man; but he bad good reason to believe it was only one of a large number of instances of great hardship spxinging from the same canse. He (tile Marquis of Clanricarde) would probably be told that a commission had been Sitting, and that the result would lead to some great improvernent in the administration of justice in India. With regard to the proposed changes in that respect he trnsted in somo points they would prove to be beneficial, but he feared tbat in others they would not be so. He believed It was recommended, for examplo, that magistrates appointed in the same way were to be continued throughouit the Country. The consequence of that would be that the European residents with one accord would object to be subjested to the jurisdiction of tribunals so constituted. It was far otherwise with the Supreme Court. There the law was administered by lawyers trained in this country, and the tribunal enjoyed the full confidence as well of the natives as of all the Europeans in the country; but it was said that that Supreme Court, notwithstanding its high character, was to be abolished, and a mixed court substituted for it. He feared the result of such an arrangement would te that the new tribunal would be presided over by men dependent upon the East India Company, and with little or none of that independence which now distinguished the judges of the Supreme Court. In one respect there would be a blessed change, for it was proposed (as we -understood) that all persons In India should be sub- .eted to the jurisdiction of the same tribunals. st state must that country be in where there was one klno of justice for the natives and another for Europeans, and where Englishmen claimed to have a separate lurisdiction for themselves? Re held in his hand published statements of Europeans resident in India, who complained with the deepest mdignation of being subjected to the whims, the prejudices, and the blunders of the officials in the subordinate courts, and they asked how long such a stateof things was to continue. Hle believed that before long no European would remain in the country and invest capital in it if he was to continue amenable to the jurisdiction of those inferior courts. Would their Lordshps believe it possible that at this time of da there was one portion of the servauts of the British Crown who claimed exemption from the jurisdiction of courts to which they were ready to subject every other c]ass of their fellow-subjects ? Were the civil strvalts of the East India Company to be exempted from a jurisdiction to which other subjects of the English Crown wero amenable? Was that the even-handed justice of Eng- I land? Surely, as was said inthe pamphlet to which he had just referred, the proverb applied to this case, " That what was sauce for the goese was sauce for the gander." He submitted that this was part of a system which required complete revision, and that it was impossible that those subordinate courts could be continued in their present state. If they were to be allowed to exist, their operation must be piided by. Englishmen who had received a legal education, if such tribunals were to command the respect of the suitors. They had a judicial committee sitting in Leadenhall-street. He should be lad to know what that bommittee did; and on that point be should shortly submit a motion to their lordslups. which he hoped would have the effect of eliciting some information which it was desirable the public should possess. He would only further say that he trusted if any papers were in the hands of the Government relating to the subject w hich he had brought under the consideration of the House they wou d be forthwith laid upon the table Earl GRANVILLESaid h, could not quite agreeswith the noble marquis in the assumption that discussions upon Indian subjects were aiwaysunpalatableto that House. From time to time, on the contrary, very interesting and important debates on such subjecta took place before their lordships; and certainly the clear and able manner in which -the noble marquis addressed himself to those questions was not likely to make their lordships less attentive to them. The noble marquis had received later information on the mnatter he had just brought under the notice of the House than be (Earl Granville) had been able to obtain. The case, as stated by the noble marquis, appeared to be one of in. competeence, if not something worse, in the proceedings of .Kr-. Thomas on the occasion in question; but when upon that case alone an extensive charge was brought against the administration of justice in India he (Earl Gran-vinlle) must say such a charge was not borne out by the facts stated by the noble marquis. Ho (Earl Gran. ville) was not avare until that eveniDg of the second chargo which the noble marquis had brought against Mr. Thomas. It was not mentioned in the offiCial papers as yet received by the Government on the subject. Be had only to say that an application had been made to the Governmentto proceed against the magistrates in this matter, but they declined to do that, and left the aggrieved party to seek his remedy in his own way. The Government, at the aXme time, declined to shield Mr. Thomas in any manner- and as respected the aggrieved party they contented tlemselves with doing what was usual in such casesnamely, advancing money to enable him to proceed with his own defence, reservingto tbemselves fulR discretion as to the course they should take after the proceedings were closed. Bsyond this he was not aware of wbat hWd taken place, or that any subsequent decision on that point had been given. The correspondence to which the noble marquis had alluded had not yet been received in this country, but it would probably arrive in a very short time. There was no reason to doubtthat, as soon as the correspondence was concluded, Lord Earris would forward it to the Home Government, and the question was ono with regard to which they would require a full explanation of all the circumstances. The noble marquis had referred to certain changes which had already been effected, and had expressed his disapproval ot one alteration which had been made in the con8titutlon of the Supreme Court, that alteration having, as he (Earl Granville) believed, been recommended in the strongest manner before the committee by most competent witnesses. Eemust remind their lordships that it woald be almost, if not utterly, impossible to carry on the Government of India satisfactorily without entrusting to some individuals more I arbitrary powers-not using that phrase in its strongest 1 sense (hear, hear)-than were necessary for the government I of Her Majesty's subjects at home. At the same time it was, undoubtedly, of the utmost importance that the exercise of such authority should sometimes be checked, and that auy abuse of it should be patished. Indeed, great care should be taken not to confide such serious powers to the hands of persons who were not likely to exercise them with pro er discretion, and he thought the noble marquis had not been sufficientfy mindful of the changes which had recently taken place, and of the arrangements which had been made to insure the appointment of duly qualiuied persons to the important office of judges. He could assure thecr lordships that, aft-er receiving the correspondence, tho Government would require information and explanations as to the whole proceedings connected with this subject. Under the circumstances it would be premature to agree to the resolution of the noble marquis, who, no doubt, would consent to postpone it to a future period. Lord CAMPBELL was unacquainted with the circumstances of this case, and was therefore unprepared to pro, nounce an opinion upon it, bat he felt it his duty to ex. press his deep regret that no effective measures had been taken for improvmng the administration of justioe in our Indian possessions. As the noble marquis had stated, jutics was mostsatisfactorilyadministered inwhat were termed the Queen's courts-the supreme courts at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay; but in vwhat were called the Mofussil courts, existing throughout the extensive area of our Indian possessions, the administration of justice was most defec. tive, for the simple reason that the judges had received no proper legal training. Indeed, many of the judges were young men who were first appointed police-magistrates, and who were soon afterwards placed as judges upon the bench. The consequence was that serious complaints were made of the manner in which justice was administered. With regard to criminal law, all Europeans were under the exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme courts, and when they entered into civil contracts they generaly made it a condition that the supreme courts alone should determine any disputes which might arise under such contracts. The great mass of the population, however, comprising many millions of people, were subjected to the jurisdiction of such magistrates and judges as he had described. The pressure of the evil had been so great that a commission had been appointed to consider the best mean of improving the administration of justice in India, and that commission included some of the most eminent jurists of whom this country could boast, either among the judges in Westminster-hall or among those who had occupied seats on the judicial benches of the supreme courts in India. His learned friend the late Cbief Justice Sir John Jervis had devoted the utmost attention to the subject, and Sir E. Ryan bad been indefatigable in his labours. The commission framed a code which it was believed would greatly improve the administration of tho laws in India, but up to the present moment that eode was a dead letter. It seemed as if no reformation could be effected either in India or in England, for there was simply an oscilation of schemes between England and India, and meanwhile the native vopulation remained in the most unfortunato position. T'he native populatlon were most anxious to be placed under the juris dction of the English courts, and he thought that prompt and efficient measures should be taken to ameliorate in this respect the condition of our fellow-subjects in India. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE said that, after the statement of the noble earl (Granville), he would withdraw bis motion. The motion was accordingly withdrawn, and their lord. ships adjourned at 6 o'clock.

BRAZIL. Mr. ROEBUCK gave notice that on that day fortnight he would call the attention of the House to the subject of our relations with Brazil, and move for a select committee to inquire into the nature of those relations. MISSIONARIES AT BENGAL. Mr. KINNAIRD gave notice that on the l1th of June be would call the attention of the House to the petition of the Protestant missionaries at Bengal, presented on the 19th of February, and would move for an address to the Crown on the subject. BOARD OF ADMIRALTY. Sir C. NAPIER gave notice that on that day fortnight he would move for a committee to inquire into the constitution of the Board of Adnsiralty, with a view to rendering it more efficient, and better adapted to the public service. LAND-TAX. Mr. MACKINNON gave notice that on that day fortnight he would move for a committee to consider the expediency of a more equitab'e adjustment of the land-tax, and also to consider whether by any means it could be made more pro- REFORMATORY SCHOOLS. Sir G..GREY intimated that he would postpone his motion on reformatory schools, which stood for to-morrow, in older that time might be given to receive such suggestions as memb-rs might wish to make for improving the measure. In answerto Ur. CoGAw, Mr. J. FITZGERALD stated that the Government contemplated the purchase of land in: Dublin on which to erect an Encumbered Estates Court, a Record Court, and other such buildings, from time to time, as necessity might arise. A sum of 10,0001. vwould be asked for in the estimates with which to commence the undertaking. CLIFFORD'S APPARATU3S. Colonel SYKES asked whether Clifford's method for lowering ship boats while a vessel was at speed had been adopted in the navy. Sir C. WOOD was understood to say that Clifford's Istem had been adopted in some of the ships belonging to tne navy, and was well thought of. Colonel SYKES asked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether any alteration in the Mercaitile Marine Ac; was contemplated; and whether, in case of alteration, the use of Clifford's method for lowering ships' boats while the vessel is at speed would be made compulsory. lr. LOWE was not aware of any contemplated alteration in the Mercantile Marine Act, and if such alteration should take place he hoped it would not be proposed to render compulsory on merchant ships any particular mode of lowering their boats. (Hear, hear.) HERRING FISHERY. Colonel SYKES asked the Secretary of the Treasury whether the commissioners' report upon the Government "brand" in the herring fishery on the shores of the northeast of Scotland was to be acted on, and whether It was contemp)lated to afford the means of shelter to shipping and the fishing beats on that coast by improving the harbour of Wick, orbDy erecting piers or breakwaters on certain points of the coast. M{r.WILSON said the commissioners a ppointed to ingumro into the Scotch fisheries were divided in opinion. One portion of them recommended that the " brand" should be continued, lint paid f or and rendered slelf-supporting the otber commLssioners recommended that the Secbranclo shouldbdfhedsontinued. Those two courses were now under the consideration of the Government.

Mr. DUNwaP calle the attention of the Secreta of State for the Colonies to the fact that while the emigrat _ion officer atooni3ong had refead to grant a certificate for nore than 81 elinee coolies being taken toeme by the John Calvin, bound for Havannab, that vessel carried away 297 such paessengers, of whom no perished on the voyage by suicide and diseose, and 23 more in quaatino and hospital at Havannao o inquiring whether this was a violation of the Chinese Passengers Act of 1855; if so, whether instrutions had been given to enforce the penalties; or whether, if itJw not, it was in. tended to propose a aendmentof theAct. Also, whther any communication bad been hade to hisdepartment of any explanation having been demanded or received from the British Consul-Geneal in Ceba of the statement, so far as regardedl the John Calvin, contained in his report on the hases of that vessel and the Dbke of Portland, that he had minutely inquired into them, andl that there was no blame whatever attached to the masters of either vesseLm Mr s. LABOnUCHERE replied that, unfortunately, owing to the retirement of the emigration officer at Honglcong, the Government had not received as ful information regarding this matter as they would otherwise have obtained. The fact, however, was that the John Calvin left Hongkong with a cargo of Chinese coolies. The niumber of coolies on board was less tohan she was authorized to carry in relation to her sie, but the emigration offocer at Hong. kong, whose duty it was to ascertan that these wero voluntory emigrants, did not license the vessel to carry more than Sa. That seemed to be in accordance with the spuit, hut there was a doubt as to whether it wss also according to the letter of the law. He would commnunicate with the law officers of the Crowi on the subject to se whether a prosecution could be raised against the parties; anad, if so, he couldo assure the hon. gentlem an that such prosecution wouldbeinstitutedby the Govern ment. On the otherhand if it was found that proceedings could not be taken, then it wolsd be necessary to make some alteration in the state of the law, which could be done by a Acoloni regulation. As to the Consul-Genera he did not thinko that any blame could justly be attributed to him. He was quite warranted in saying that the passelners on board bad been treated with humanity, an lthat t e general regulations applicable to the vessel had been carried out.

(Hear, hbear.) THE LORD RAGLAN TROOP SEHIP. Mr. LAURIE asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether it was decided that LOOO troop-, with officers and women, were about to leave Kingston for the Mauritius on board the ship Lord Raglan; and whether a vesse of such tonnage was capable of containing so large a number with any comfort or safety? Sir C. WOOD said, the nubnber of men about to bo sent out in the Lord Raglan was not 1,000, -but 727 with officers and women-in all, 904, including 20 children. As she had on a former occasion carfied 984 souls, there was no doubt about her having ample accommodation for 904. THIE CATTLE MURRAIN. Lord NAAS asked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether Her Majesty's Government had received any. communications relative to the murraiu said to be ragin among the cattle on the continent and whether he would lay such communications on the ale of the Hosea? Mr. LOWE said, he had no objection to lay the communications which had been received on this sub ject on the table, hut a report which had 'been made bs y Dr. Greenbough, under the directions of the Board of Trade, would in the course of a day or two be laid on the table ; and as it would contain all the interesting information contained in those c nicati pehaps the nobile lord would walt unti he sa otheureport. fsr, owe ver, on seeing it th noble lord was not satisfied, there would be no objection to the production of the original documents. GUANO. Mr. BAXTER asked the First Lord of the Admiralfy whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to send out a few snall vessels of war for the purpot ctf southearchingstherain coast of Africaa, and ott P promising RnerLocali fora supplieas ofguno; whth nrobabtany negotiationsohad-beenPenteredointoswith the BraeiliantGovernment for securing aright to remove nitrate of soda from the deoisltl icvrdnear Pernambuco. Sir C, WOOD said, there was no intention of sending out any special vessels to the district referred to by the hon. inember. Instructions had been sent out in 18 a in 1852, and again ia 1853, to naval officers on various stations, ineluding officers on the West Coast of Africa, directing them to take every opportunity of ascertaining where any large suppees of guano existed or were likely to bteaiscovered on any part of the coast. Various reports had been received from naval officers on the subject, but notbing very satisfactory in the way of actual information as to the existence of guano. Before sitting down he would answer a question, of which notice had been given by another hon. gentleman (Mr. Caird), as to whether a search for guano formed partusthe instructions to Her Majesty's officers at present engaged in the sUrveys of the coast of Egypt, the south-east coast of Africa, the South-West Pacific, and the River La Plata. There was not much probability of guano being discovered on the low lands of t coast of Egypt or on the banks of the La Plata; the survey of the south-easa coast of Africa was a mere land survey, but with regard to the South-West Pacific orders had been gicen to the surveying officers to ascertain the probability of the existence of guano. ue was not aware that there were any negotiations going orn with Brazi for the purpose of obtaining the right to remove nitrate of sods from the deposits lately discovered near Pernambuco. WILLIAM CUFFEY. Mx. T. DUNCOMBE asked the Secretary of State for the Rome Department why Williaa Cuffey had Rot participated in the general amnesty granted in the spring of last year by Her Majesty to all political prisoners.? It would b in the recollection of the House that, on the declaration of peace, a general amnesty was issued under which aU political prisoners were set free. Somne 28 prisoners obtained their freedom, and some of them returned to this countryc; bt for someorieas,on orwotherWilliam CHsb y hd t not yet been set at lIberty.

NoDanswer had been received to that despatih, nor had any despatch been received respecting an absolute pardon. Cioffey's conduct had been good." He was sure that there must have been some omission or negligence on the part of the authorities at home, or Cuffey 'would have received his pardonwith the other prisoners. Sir G. GREY said, thereo a been no difference inade between Cuffey and any other of the political prisoners. A pardon was passed under the Great Seal to alepolitical prisoners,d a list of them was transmitted to the colonial auathorities, on which list was the name of William Cuffey. It was quite possible that there might have been some delay in restoring him to freedom, in consequence of a necessary reference to the law officers as to the form in which the pardons ought to be made out, and it might be possible that the despatech containing their decision had not arrived at the colony at the date referred to by the hon. gentleman. The delay, however, would apply equally to all the prisoners, for no difference had been made, and as Cuffey's name was on the list he would receive his pardon at the same time as the others THE SOUND DUES.

Due notice would be given as to the day when the subject of the convention would be brought before the House. EDUCATION. In answer to Mr. SLx&EY, Sir J. PAIINGTON said, that he did not intend to move for leave to introduce any Education Blt this session, as he thought it would be quite useless for any private member to attempt independent legislation this session. THE URGENT AND THE MEGERA. Admiral WALCOTT said, he wished to put a question to the First Lord of the Admialty in reference to a statement made by him on a previous evening, when stating the cir. cunistances under which the ship Urgent had put into Corunna. It was of the highest importance that statements made by a Minister of the Crown on matters of this description should be unimpeachable, and he was sure therefore, that the right hon. gentleman would be obliged to him for calling his attention to a letter in The Times newspaper, in which his statement that the Urgent had entered Corunnain consequence of .having met with severe gales and heavy seas was directly contradicted, and it was asserted that she went in in smooth water and calm weather. (Cries of "Order ! i) If he were out of order, he would conclude by a motion that the Rouse do adiourn - but he was sure that the right hon. gentleman would be able to give a satisfactory explanation. (Hear, hear.) Sir C. WOOD said, he was very much obliged to the gallant Admiral for having given him an opportunity of setting himself right with the House after the attack which had been made on his veracity. He had been accused of having deceived the House by a false statement; but the only foundation for that charge was obtained by putting that into his mouth which he had never said. HE was accused of having said that the Urgent had been driven into Coranna by bad weather, but he had never said any such thing. On the contrary. he had read to the House a letter, in which it was stated that she steamed into CorunnA, in smooth water and fine weather. It was of the Megsra that he had said that she had been driven to enter Coranna by bad weather. and he had stated that a large merchantman which had been out in the same gale had been driven back, and had eatered Plymoath under a jurymast. That statement applied to tho tegiera, and not to tho Urgent. Before sitting dlown the House would be glad to hear that he had received a letter from the commander of the Transit, written off the Cape de Verd islands, in which he stated that the performance of tho vessel under steam was of the most satisfactory description, and that the health of the crew and of the men was most satisfactory. (Hear, hear.) POSTAL COhMUNICATION BETWEEN LONDON AND DUBLIN. In reply to Mr. GRoGA&, Mr. WILSON stated that the eminent engineer, Mr. Rcndall, was at present engaged at Holyhead in making arrangements for facilitating the shipment and landing of themasil and passengers for Ireland at that port. THE NAVAL ESTIMATES. Sir C. WOOD seated that he would lay the naval estimates upon the table this evening, and gave notice that he should move the votes in committee of supply on Monday LIFE INSURANCE OFFICES. M1r. WILSON had upon the paper a notice that he would ask leave to introduce a Bil for the regulation of life insurance offices, but, as some doubt had arisen as to the form in which the measure should be framed, he postponed its introduction until this day (Friday) week. THE PROPERTY AND EARNIGS OF MARRIED WOMEN. Sir E. PERRY rose to move for leave to introduce a Bill to amend the law with respect to the property of smarried women and their separate earnings. In consequence of the observations which were made by the present Chief-Jusice of the Common Pleas, then Attorney-General, last year, he had anticipated that this sabject would havo been taken up by the Government; but there had been si little discussion upon it that they were, perhaps, not justified inr esorting to sny speedy legislation. All that could be expeote,i by those who took an interest in the matter was that they should have an opportunity of fully discussing the principles on which reform oughtto proceed. During thelast session nearly 25,OOO petitioners, including some persons of the greatest eminence in literature, art, and science, addressed the House, complaining of the present state of the law, and mentioning examples of its injustice which had come within their own experience. Measures had been introduced into another place for the purpose of facilitating divorce. His opinion was that such measures were not desired by the people of England, who had not petitioned for them, and that all existing grievances might be removed by the enactment of a wise and comprehensive measure as to the enjoy. ment of property between husband and wife. A hasband requiredtoberelievedfrompecuniry obligationscontractedbya guilty wife; while an innocent wife needed that her earning',, or any property which might come from her famiy, should be secured from the interference of a profligate husband. A wise and comprehensive law upon this subject, with something hke a compulsory separation in cases of gross ill-treatment, would, he believed, render unnecessary any alteration of the law of divorce. The objections which were made to the present state of the law were that the common law of England was unjust in principle, that it differed from the law of all other civilized countries, that it even departed from its own principles, and was grievous in its operation. He would not dwell at length upon these points, because he understood that no objection wonld be made to the introduction of this Bil. At present a married woman had no right to hold property apart from her husband ; she could not without his concurrenme obtain the protection of our courtsof justice, and whenever a question hadarisen between husband and wife the enactments of the Legislature and the decisions of the courts had been against the wife, and in favour of the husband. Thus if a man had an equitable right in land a woman was alUowed no dower - but the courts would support the interest of a husband in land, Sith respect to which a woman had only equitable rights. Soalso the right of a woman to a third part of her husband's personal property was left entirely at the mercy of the man, who might, if he pleased, will away aU his property without regard to this right. Yet with all these provisions of our ilaw and decisions of our courts Sir wMiam Blackstone laid it down that women were great favourites of the law of England! By the Roman law the woman was treated with respect to her property precisely in the same way as the man, and was subject to the same oblgations. So aiso the German law, and the law prevailing over the greater part of the continent gave to the wife an indefeasible share in the common stock, which in the Roman law was caUed communio bonorum. He was justified, therefore, in saying that the English law differed from that of other civilized countries, and not only was that the case, but it also had departed fromits own principlss. The early English law did not take from the wife her landed property; aU that it did was to give to her husband after her death a life interest in it provided that a child had been born of the marriage, and in return it gave to the wife one-third of her husband's property after his death, whether a child was born or not. nThe same right of the wife existed with regard to personality also, but that right had imperceptibly been destroyed. If, then, the law in itself was anomalous, English jurists should be called upoea to defend that anomaly; h ba' that the case? Why, it was very rarely indeed that any member of the legal profession put forward any defence for the law as it at present stood. There was at one time a distingaished judge who differed from his views upon this subject, and who maintained the position, that as the law cast upon the husband the maintenance of his wife and children and the education of the latter, so it was only just that the husband should take aU the personal property in order to enable him to carry out his obligations. ow the conclusion appeared to him tobe a wide one. In the first place there might be no children at alL Then, again, the common law of England did not compel a man to maintain and educate his children, ho was only compelled by the Poor Law to eee that they did not become chargeable to the parBh, and he was not compelled to educate them at all. The lw was content to leave the education of the children to the parental feeling, bat sarelv that was as strong in the mother as in the father; and, therefore, the education of the chldren afforded no reason for taking the property of the mother away from her. He would not occupy the time of the House by relating instances of injustice which the existing system had produced, bht he wished to refer to one instanee narrated in a late number of the Edinburgh&eview A yoang lady, who possessed a great deal of money in the Ba, wlopedwith ayoung officer. A solicitor was asked to endeavour to stop the marriage. He arrived before the marriage was solemnized, but the young lady being of age he had no control over the proceedings. He succeeded, however, in obtaining a postponement for 24 hours, and during that period articles of settlement were prepared and executed. The solicitor wisely put a distriinas upon the lady's stock, and it was fortunate that he had done so, for shortly after the marriage the husband demanded a transfer of the stock of his wife to his own name, which but for the distr-ingas would have been made, and the lady would have lost all right to her own property. Cases of hardship under the present system were most numerous, and if any inquiry should take place before a committee of the House he would undertake to prove that some legislationupon the subjectwas necessary. Ho might be asked what remedy he sought to apply. In tho first place he would lay down the principle as a fundamental one, that persons should be allowed before marriage to make what settlements they pleased. That was at present the case among the richer classes, but the great difficulty was felt in legislating for the.humbler elasses. A learned society, however, -the Law Amendment Society-had almost unanimously agreed that the best method of improving the present law would be to leave to the husband and wife the power each of enjoying their own property as far as it was not affected by any settlement before marriage, a recommendation which was in accordance with the Roman law. In the United States also a similar principle was in force, and had been found extremely beneficial. The society to which he had just adverted had addressed a communieation to America, to Mr. D. Dudley Field, who was well known in this country, and he should read to the House the letter which that gentleman had written in reply. It was as follows " New York, Jan. 29. Gentlemen,-I now give you a copy of the statutes of New York at present in force relating to divorces and the property of married women, and a copy or extract of the statutes of theotherStatesrelating to the latter subjectupto 1854.. The sabject is difficult and requires delicate handling. We know that what is wanted for the protection of married women is to secure their persons, property, and earnings aqainst abuse by improvident or ill-disposed husbands. If a'law could be framed for these cases of abuse there would bono need of disturbingthe present legal relations of the sexes in other cases, But this would be obviously impracticable. Whatever law is passed must be generaL relating to al wives and all husbands, and securing to aU wives thosenrights which only the unhappy need assert. The changes 'which thus far have been made in this State nave proved in their operation as beteficial as any reasonable friend could have expected. Of course there are cavilless, as there are against every change, but no one imagines that an effort to repeal the laws wMold be successful. This is the bost test of the operation of a measure according to the judgment of the people upon whom it operates. An attempt to restore the old laws of marital rights would have as ittlechance of success here as an attempt to restore the Com Laws in England.-I am, &c, DAVID DUDLEY Now, if the right of being able to possess property to bcr separate use were given to a married woman, the question then arose in what her liabilities were to consist f Upon that point he had no hesitation in ssying that with the right of property its liabilities shold ccrue. The 'wife shonld be made to answer for her own contracts entered into before as weU as after her marriage, and it would follow, if that principle were adopted, that the anomaly which at | present existed in our law of making the husband responsible for the debts to any am ount which his wife might have contracted urevious to her marriage would be obviated, But the hnsSand was also liable for all the acts of his wife by which damage was occasioned to another party, even though the injury should be done in direct opposition to his wish. A woman might slander her neigh. beur, and upon her husband would rest the cnus of paying. for thedamagewhich her tongue had inflicted. If, however, the wife were allowed to possess property to her separate use, she should be made to bear the pecuniary loss which might be the result of her conduct. From that responsibility he did not believe that the women of England were desirous to shrink. (Hear, hear.) Many of them had petitioned that House upon the subject, and were prepared for the consequences which their uncontrolled acts might entail. The House ws well aware that, even as the law now stood, the upper clsses of society were enabled to protect themseles gainst its operation. They had at their disposal solicitors, as well as the Cort Of Chancery withnall its expensive machinery, to aid theml iP. the matter, and aUl he aimed at effecting as to give to the middle and indus. triousclasses the adrantages in that rspect which their more wealthy felow-subjet anjoyed Inconclusiou, he begged to niovefor leave to brng an a Bill to amend the law of proerty as it affected mrined womel and, their separate earnings. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DRUMMOND said, the hem and learned gentleman had asked him sinee he had entered the House to seoord his motion, and he felt great leere in complying with that request. He was convinoee that the oppresion occasioned in the case of married women by the operation of the existing law was exceedingly unjustandsevere. Heentertainedcon. siderable donbt, however, whether his hon. and learned friend would be able toaomplish the object -which he had in view without taking a prior step and giving greator facility for obtaining divorces a mensd et thoro. (Hlear, hear.) He had hoped that a Bil upon that sLbject would have come down from the other House in time to afford them an opportunity of dealing with the question before tho measure under their notice had been introduczd; and he might add that the point one upon which he felt so strongly that he had intnded to bring in a Bill himself with regard to it, and he should have done so had he not learned from experience the itter inutility of pranttmpt to carry such a BiU through its various stes upon the paut of ant ody exept some greet man connected itoh the Government. (hear, hoar, and a ladugh.) The ATTORNEYu GENEReL said that in rising to tate that hu would not oppose the motion ohich the hon. and learned gentleman the member for Devonport hadVjust made he wras by no means desirous of preventing dcussion UpTh the subject with which his Bill proposed to deal. On the contrary, he should bo very glad that hon. membiers generally should give to tat subject their anxious attention, inasmuchas thoy must be prepared to take it into Con' sideration hen the Divorce Bill, wvhich might confidently bo expected to come donwn fron the louse of Lords; came under thoir notihe. The psroposition of the hon. and learned member 0as one of a, character very different from the ordinary schemes of law reform. Tho laws affecting the property of married women, and their thus in respect of that property, were intBmately bound up vith our social institutions, and it was by no means a light matter to attenpt to introduce into a system of jurisprudence such alterations-as must involve a material change in the social institutions of a nation. (Hear, haar.) The hon, and learned gentleman therefore had taken upon himself a very difficult nd onerous task, and if his Bill contained no other provisions than these to which he had referred in the course of his speech ho must not anticipate that it nould be received wlith very genera favour. Indeed, so far as ho (th EeAttorneyaGener.l) coulid gather from tho observations of the hon. and learned gentleman, the operation of his Bill seemed to ho confined to the creation of a communie bonvoaum, to the placing of the women of England in a strong-minded and idependent position e huear, hear, andta laugh),t hioh position the hen, and learned gentleman had described as consisting in the rendering them accountable for eveoything which they might fy or do. Now, he (tho AttorneyGeneral), for one, did net think that was a position which the best and most amiable of the women of England were anxious to occupy. (Eear, hear.) He was at the same time undoubtedly desirous that the law of this country upon the subject of the property of married women should ho made consistent with itself, aud in the expression of his indi vidual opinions he should endeavour to point out how far he was predisposed to go in the advocacy of a measure of reform upon that headL Tho hon. and learned gentleman had correctly observed that there existed. a remarkable difference betwoeen the efect of the contract for marriage upon real as compared with personal property. The House was well awvare that during the early nstory of the laws of Enland personal property had been greatly disregarded. Such, however, had not beenlthe casewith real property, andr hen ahmarriage took pLace she law gave to tho husband, not unqualified ownersthp over sucn property, but asright to receiv the rents and profits u gout of it during the period of cover ture. He could make during that period no alienation of it which would operate as an effectual sale, without the consen hs wie. But how absurd did it appear that while 500b. per annum arising out of real property could not pass into the uncontrolled possession of the husband :n rieht of the mrrriage contract, 20,0001. in the funds would be placed completely at his disposal?9 (Hear, hear.) He should feel by no means indisposed to allow the husband the rieht to enoy the diidends only upon that sum, unless, indeed, the wife, subsequent to the muazrrage, taking advantage of the safe uards which the law at present threwd around er in the case of real property, should consent to transfer her personal property herself. He should, he repeated, alldw the dividends to go to the husband, as was now the case under the existing law, subject to tho condition of maintaining, protecting, and guarding his wife; and if that duty were not duly disebargedhe should propose that the property should remain intact, and that the rifh interest of the husband in it should revert to the whe, in case she had been deserted orobrutally treated. The next subject to which the hon. and learned member had alluded was the property ( hich a married woman might have acquired by her latour in any trade or business caried on without the co-operation of her husband. Now, with respect to that descrption of property, equity recognized he rght of a separante income in the infe*vand he should therefore give ais consent tothe proposition that the exclusive earninas of a wife during covertwe should become her separate property. (Hear.) He might also state his opiuion in relerence to any acquisitions of the wife in the shape of gift made to her afoer the coverture. The common law was at variance with equity on this subject, and the variance led to great inconvenience. If a married woman who had made no settlement had a cum of money or other property beqneathed to her fterthe coverture she hada right to come into a court of equityandrequire a settlement to be made. A certain portion of the princpal was then taken awiay and set apart for her use, with remainder to the children of the marriage. Bet this could only be done in ascourt of equity, and even this interposiion was limited by the amount of tho property in question. Such a right ought to h tossmessed bya married vwoman without the necessity tifor applying to apcourt o Justice at all, and it was cruel to throw upon her the obligation to come into so costly a tribunal as a court of equity for such a purpcose. (Hear, hear.) He should propose to give the husband a life interest only in the subsequent acqusltions of the wife, subject to the oHligation, or course, of maintaining and protecting her. He only spoLe for himelf, for he did not kneow how far those members of the Government who had considered this subject were prepared to go. He did not know any subject more diwomlt5 or that ought to he approached and handled with more anxiety and care than anythingthhat dealt with the existing established relations between husband and wifeh Hear, hear.) Sir J. PAtiNGTON hoped that the hon. and learned member for Plymouth, in draning this bil, would very much follow the course recommended by the Attorney. General. He saw no reason why a married woman should not enjoy the same protection and security in regard to persenal property thatwas given to real property. Cases of great hardship sometimes arose where a separatiOn had taken place, and where parties were not living as husband and wife but without a divorc.e An wld-conduotid hsband inould frequently in such cases seize the earningsof his wife, and appropriate them to his own use. re believed that the law did not at present protect a woman so situated. [The Attorey-General intimated his assent to the proposition.) If such cwaere the lawg amor pressing and important case for legislatiAe interference was made out than in the relations of husband and wife during coverture. [The AttorneysGeneraL-A foerathe there is a stronger case during separation.] This was an injustice which it would be easy to correct; for there would be no difference in opinion as to the necessity of applying a remedy in such cases. (Riear, hear.) Ae thaunked the hen, and learead gentleman the member for Plymouth for the course he was pursing, ut he would actwisely in follongthe jdicios advice of the Attordey-General. The House could not procfd haith too much eantion in legislating on this subject. 3r. ROPE said that the speech of the Attorney-General WaS the best answver to the rather extravagant demands of the large and manly body of 'estrong-mbinded women" whose advocate the hon. and learned member for Plymouth had constituted himselE. (A laugh.) Hitherto there had been free trade in the pecuniary relations of husbaud and wife, and to revert to a system of protection required rather delicate handling. No doubt the law of husband and wife was in an anomalous state in many respects, but the Attorney-General had done wisely in remoi ng the subject from those QueStions of abstract women's rights wehich were sometimes advocated by young ladies in pamphlets,; and further developed by Margaret Feller, afterwvards Countess Ossoli, and in the pages of Aurorac Leigh. The hardest cases of grievance were found when drunken and profligate husbands wrenched from their hardworking wives the few pencue they had just earned by the sweat of their brow. But how could any legislation meet such cases? If the law declared that these penoe should be her own, how could it save her when the brutal husband - #ame u- so wrestthem ro he hnd She mih go toa camae to wrest them from her hand? She might go to a magistrate, but wvhat could a magistrate do? He might make an order upon the husband to refund the money, but that would be already spent; and if the magistrate sent the husband to prison, he would, perhaps, only leave the wifo to beg in the streets. Such a law, to give effectual protection to the woman, would require a more expensive machinery than he at present saw his way to constitute, Then, if Parliament recognized a separate right in the wife to property and earnings, would it not in some sort encourage a bad husband to say to his wife, "Go and earn your own bread, as the Act of Parliament you, and I wash my hands of your support 1" He should not oppose the introduction of the BilL Doubtless there were many anomalies in the law which ought to e corrected, but let them consider the whole coniugal question inrits undivided berings.

The question was about to be put, when Mr. STAFFORD, without resisting the introduttion o! tho Bil, called upon tho Govern=mnt opinionsupon it. to .declare thelt Lord PALUMB TON,in aalY, d,--Sir, I took theoppotuit lstseson, when my hon. friend brought thia. subject before the Hota, to stte that the GovernmentV after full consideration of the matter, were prepared t- c-onur with his motion. (Hear, hiear.) Some of the details. of the Bill may posibly Tequire alteration, but its principle we are ready to support. Mr. DISRAELL-I understand the principle of the Bil is the abolition of Ministers money, and it has always beero opposed by every Government within my resollection. Lor4d ohn Russell's Government opposed it- the AberdeMese XMistr,, opposed it; as did also the noble ford himself, thoeven ' it 3a prniple of confiacion. (Hear.) However,' thig iS not *, fittEnf okportunity So enter into the diecidon of the principle o th1i Bil. The best time for doing that is. when we are prepared to aivide; for when leave is asked tointroduce a measure, andi the requlredycrmussoio is cian. cded by the Government, the period Is not a convenient. one for canvas ing its mrits. 7Btt there is one observa.. tion on a Bil of this kind which I canot naow re-. frain from making. The importance of its ]ricidecanot be exaggrated. In fact, if sationed,it will strike. at the veryroot_of allChurch 0ProprtY. (Hear,hear.) The. Bill, it seems, is approved an wil be supported by the, Government. Underthesecircumstances, is it not much, better, when a meaosure involving a principle of sucht gravity isto be brought in, that it should be introduced gr the Uovernment itself? (Hear, hear.) And if Her Kalesat. Ministers have deemed it consistent with their duty to permit a private member to bring forward aBill on a subject of this magnitude, they are bound infairness to this Hcuse ana: the country to take care that, its princple having been ap.- proved by them as hinisers, this House should have an. earlyopportunityofexpressingitsopinionuponit. (Hear. If a me re of this kind be left to private meubero5 thls louse, the chances, - we have been told by the bon. memnber for Surrey, are greatly aganst it ever being brought. before the House for a definitive decison. I thini, therefore, after the frank aclknowledent of the noble lord that- he approves the principle of t4Weasureof the hon. memher for Cork, and that his Oovd~eut intends to spport it, the noble lord is bound tomiesuch arrangements that it. shouldbe b.-ought speedily to a second readingin orderthat. the House m ay have an opportunity of expressingritself upon its policy. (Hear, bear.} Imyself shall certainlyS give to itan earnestbopposition. (Hea, hear.) Sir G. GRECY.-I agree with the right hon. gentlemanthat it would be inconvenient to discuss this meau atpresent, and that it would be better to do so on the seoondZ reading. I will therefore not follow the right hon. gentle. man inthe observation whie'hhe has made in opposition to the Bill. rI ill only say that we propose to dothat which was stated by the right hon. gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland at the close of last session,-namely, to act in accordance with the recommendation of a comnhttee of thi& House which sat in !8W. That committee reported that the collection of these funds from house to house in the towns in which it is levied is eo difficult that it would be prudent to discontinue it. I will merely add with regard tothe introduction of this Bill that it is a measure whscli hasL been frequently brought before the House, and it would, have been somewhat ungracious to take it out of the hon_ Inember'shands after he d given notice of it. (tear.) Witlc respect to the delay -whichi it is said is lik-ely to occurthrough the measure being left to a private member, I can onl* say that, looking at the character of the Government. busmess which is, or which shortly will be, before theHouse, and the time which may be occupied with the eon. sideration of the estimates, I believe the House will bes called upon mnuch sooner to pronounce an opinion upon thisBill by its being fixed for a Wednesday-a day which is. open for the progress of Bils brought in by private mnem. bers-thn if it were postponed to a Government day. Mr. NAPIR.-I think that Wednesday is the moat inconvenient day that could have have been fixed pon, for the discussion of a measure of so much importance. I do not know whether-the Secretary for Ireland made, at the end of last session the statement which is reported; to have been made by him; but I believe that. the accuray of that reported statement has been admitted by the righthon. gentleman himself. I am so informed from a commnnication which I have had with the Ecclesiastical Commni . sionersX, who say they have been told that the right hon. gentleman is prepared to admit in his place in the House of Commons the accurY of that reported statement, At all' events, when the discussion comes on, I shall be prepared to show that that statement is inaccurate in anits parts, a- reported. The right hon. baronet the Secretaryof Stato forthe Home Department upon two occasions, and while heheld under Lord John Russell the office 'Which he, *now holds, opposed the abolition of ministers' money. (Hear, hear.) The committee of 1848 did not report in favour of its abolition. It reported that a sub. stitute should be provided when the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners should have so increased as to produce a margin applicable for the liquidation of this demand. The whole question is of deep importance It involves a deep principle. (Hear, hear.) It affects the Churh oP Ireland, and consequently the United Church of England and Ireland - but I shall reserve my observations tifl the second readmg, on which oecasion I think I shaU be able to show a sufficient case for its entire rejection.- (Hear, hear.) Mr. HORSMAN.-WhatI said was this-that the report. of the statement which I made was correct in all its parts, but that if any ono impugned the accuracy of what I sad. ar4 could show me in what respect I was inaccurate, I should be happy to rceive his information, and to ackmoW* ledge my error in my place in Parliament. Mr. NAPIER.-One of the inaccuracies of the right hon gentleman is this-that he stated the margin of the Eccle siastical Commissioners' funds to be 2Z,000. more than it really is. MIr. EENLEY having briefly urged upon Lord Palmer. ston the great Inconvenience of a Bill involving such im. portant principles being discussed on a Wednesday, Leave was granted, and the BiU was brought in and read a first time. REGISTRATION OF VOTERS (SCOTLADID). The LORD-ADVOCATE moved for leave to bring in W Bil to amend the law for tho registration of persons entitled to vote in the election of members to serve in Parliament for counties in Scotland. Mfr. BLACCKBURN had hoped that as Her MajesWs. Government had promised to introduce a Parliamentay Reform Bill next session, the Lord-Advocate woulda not have asked the House to consider this Bill, which wa oonsidered by the last Parliament and was found to be in manyr respects very objectionable. Mr. G. DUNDAS should feel it to be his duty to take the, same course this, as he did last year with regard to this, Bill. He greatly regretted that the Lord-Advocate should have attempted at so late a period, and so long after those S meetings which were held in Scotland for the discusson of measures of public importance, to urge on his meare,which had already caused so much dissatisfaction and expense in those Scotch burghs to which its princiole had ben applied. Scotland was already over-taxed, and this Bil would add unnecessarilyto her burdens He advisedtheLordAdvocate to withdraw his motion until the noble lord at the, head of the Government introduced what the hon. member for Surrey called the "liodge-podge" of next session. Mr. KINNAIRD rejoiced that the Lord-Advocate in. tended to persevere with his Bill of last session, becauee he. believed that wherever its principle had been put into one ration in the burghs of Scotland it had worked admiraby (Hear, hear.) M.CIIFE)br etmn otestsatr p Mr. CRAUEURD boro testimOny to the satisfactoryop ration of the principle of the measure in the Scotc burghs, and said he believed that the extension of the rin. ciple to Scotch oounties would be a great boon. It ought to. be recollected at this time, when all were anxious to see the, franchise extended, that before it was lowered care shouldc be taken to enable all those who were already entitled tot the franchise to exercise it. The expense at present connected with placing a Scotch county voter on the regist was so great that many men were deterred from apflying for the enrolment of their names on the regitry. BIe hoped, therefore, that the Lord-Advocate would press forward thle measure The LORD-ADVOCATE, having promised to give on. the occasion of the second reading a full explanation of the measure, and to defend it against the observations of Mr. Blackburn and Mr. Dundas, Leave was given and the Bill was brought in and read a first time. On the motion of Colonel BOLDraRO returns were ordered of the number of huts supplied to the Ordnance or War Departments during the years 18545 and 145-6; the appro. priation of the same, together with the stations, and Una. tities sent to each; andof the names of the several con=rtors, amount of each contract, and prioe per but. withl dimensions; the present extent of hut accommodation in England and Ireland, and the number of troops hutted oxs the lst of April, 1857.

!I f o F-MABKBTanCITYINTBLLIGEN 0. Thursday Evening. The English funds maintain their recent improvement. They opened steadily to-day at the closing prices of last evening, and, although there was subsequently a fall, consequent upon an increased demand for loans, the marilet recovered before the close. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 94 to i, and in the middle of the day they went to 93i, but the last official prices were again 94 to J for money, and 94i to i for the 4th of June. After regular hours there was less firmness, and some operations took place at a decline of an eighth. In many cases 7 per cent. -was paid for advances on Government securities. This renewed pressure was attributed partly to transactions in connexion with the adjustment of the half-monthly account in the foreign and share markets, and partly to some realizations of stock by the public. The disposition of the speculators throughout the day was to effect purchases. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214 - Reduced, 92 to -; New Three per Cents., 924 to ;; India Stock, 220 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98- to i; and India-bonds, 7s. to 3s. discount. The Government brokers made a further purchas o of 30,0001. Exchequer-bills, paying 2s. premium2 for the June, and 4s. for the March descriptions. The final quotations were (June), par to 2s, premium; (March), Is. to 5s. premium. There was an active demand for discount to-day, but the market has a satisfactory appearance. A further advance took place in Turkish Six per Cents., and other securities also showed a tendency to improvement. Mexican, Portuguese, and Spanish were firm, with an increased business. Turkish Six per Cents., for money, wvere negotiated at 05; for the account, 95, 95g, 9o, and 95g. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions for money were at 100 , and for the account at 101i and 4. Brazilian Five per Cents., 1001 and 99i; the I ive per Cents., New, 99* and i; Mexican, for the account, 23k; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 54k; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45; Russian Four-and-a-Waif per Cents., 96k; Sardinian Five per Cents., 911 and As; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 42; the New Deferred, for the account, 256 ; and Spanish Certificates, 61 and 7W. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were G9f. 30c. for money and 69f. 55c. for the end of the month, showing a dul market, but no general alteration. The shares of the Bank of France continue to improve. The continental exchanges continue firm at all points. A furthor sum of nearly 20,0001. in gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The Ellenborough has arrived from Sydney with 30,000 severeisgn. The Irene is also reported from Adelaide, but she is not believed to have brought any gold. The gradual but steady influx of gold which seems during the last week or two to have set in from most quarters is beginning to lead to discussion as to the probability of an early return to the rate of 6 per cent. by the Bank of England. The delay in publishing the weekly Gazette statements deprives the public of the most important materials for forming an opinion on the point ; but, judging from those issued up to the 2d inst., and supposing that the increase in the bullion since that date may have been about 300,0001., so as to raise the total to 9,850,0001. a further improveinent to the extent of about half a million will still most probably be required before any alteration can be looked for. This, however, may now take place at any moment. The change of wind gives a prospect of the speedy arrival from Australia of about 700,0001. ; each weekly packet from New York will bring a considerable sum; about 50,000 sovereigns are on their way from Constantinople; and to-dav some bills on London of large amount, drawn fromr St. Petersburg against gold shipped, have made their appearance-the aggregate expected thence being at least 200,0001. or 300,0001. It was at about this date last year that a sudden and strong, although only temporary, revival from a long period of depression took place. On the 17th of May, 1856, the bullion stood at 9,800,0001., and in the succeeding week it reached 10,550,0001., the Bank meanwhile having reduced their rates, which for the past half-year had been at 6 and 7 per cent., according to the term of the paper, to 6 per cent. for all descriptions. By the 31st of May a further augmentation had occurred to 11,380,0001., the rate having two days previously been lowered to 5 per cent. UTp to the end of June the favourable movement continued without interruption, until the bullion had reached 13,070,0001. and the rate of discount was put at 4i per cent. The tide then again turned, and from that period to the present, an interval of nearly 11 months, with very few exceptions, each weekly statement has shown a falling off. The signs of reaction, therefore, have not arrived before the time at which, froni all past expelience, it might fairly have been expected. It is to be hoped that it will not be as rapid and delusive as that of last year; but it is upon the discretion of the public with regard to foreign undertakings that this will in a great degree depend, although the progress of the silk crop and the prospects of the European grain harvest must for the next three months constitute the main considerations. The susyension was announced to-day of Messrs. E:dwvard J. Hambro and Co., general merchants. Their trade was rather extensive, and it is supposed their liabilities may be considerable. It is understood that Messrs. Coutts and Co. have lately notified their willingness to allow interest on any large sums deposited with them for fixed periods, thus assimilating their practice to that of the jointstock banks. The measure is a new one on the part of private bankers, but it involves a nominal rather than a real alteration of system, the practice hitherto of all the London houses having been to take sums to employ on behalf of their customers according to such agreement as might seem mutually desirable. Messrs. Coutts and Co. having now placed this description of business on a fixed footing, most of the other private banks will probably take a similar course. At a meeting of the National Provincial Bank of England, held to-day, Mr. J. F. Laurie presiding, a dividend at the rate of S percent. per annum, together with a bonus of 10 per cent., was declared, and the report was unanimously adopted. The Chairman, in alluding to the progress of business during 1856, referred to the healthy and prosperous condition of commercial and agricultural affairs, notwithstanding the high value of money. The late failures of private and joint-stock banks have caused some apprehension among the public, but it was contended that the majority of the joint-stock banks are entitled to cr-edit for their general management and the assistance they have afforded towards carrying out the present extensive operations of the country. In the case of the iational Provincial Bank of England every safeguard has been adopted to prevent any improper advantage being taken of the funds. The result of the late increase of capital by the issue of 15,000 shares, 2,500 having been allotted to customers at 101. premium has been satisfactory, and the 25,0001. profit is to form the nucleus of a buildingfund to meet the ex- pencuutLre necessary in improving the London establishment and several of the branches. The announcement of a bonus of 10 per cent. having been given to the officers on their salaries at the close of the year was approved. One of the shareholders although fully satisfied with the report, desired information with respect to the examination of securities and the payments of calls by directors. In answer it was stated that bills and all kinds of securities are regularly examined daily, and that a report is made weekly to the court, every precaution being used to insure regular and correct management. The directors calls have been punctually paid. The following is an abstract of the report:- " The directors experience gratification in presenting the annual report, exhibiting, as it does, evidence of increasing prosperity. The proprictors'will recollect that at the last annual general meeting a proposition (submitted by the directors) for au increase in the bauk's capita!, by the issue of 15,000 shares of 201. each, was adopted. Of this number of shares 12,500 have been taken up and paid for by existing shareholders, in accordance with the principle of distribution agreed upon, and the remainder of the shares (2,5 0 have been allotted to customers of the company's branches at 10l. premium. These shares also have all been taken up by the allottees. The paid-up capital of the bank now stands at 525,0001., and when the remaining call of 61. per share, payable on the 31st of July next, is received it will amount to 600,000l. The premium received upon the 2,500 shares, amounting to 25,0001., itisproposedto set apart for the purposes of a building fund. The expenditure of this sum'will be the subject of future report to the proprietors. In glancing at the characteristics of the past year the cir. ounatance which first claims notice is the unconditional acceptance in January by Russia of the terms of peace offored by the alied Powers, Tho announcement of peace once more unfettered the springs of enterprise, and Imparted a powerful stimulus to the trading and adustrial interests. The most intreating and striking feature in the history of .°56 was the existenceof a state of great commercial prosperity, contemporaneous with severe financial pressure. Notwithstanding that the value of money ruled unusually bigh, the price of manufactured goods and of every article of gener consumption advanced-the operations of trade, both internal and external, were active and upon an extended scale, and the year happily wonnd up without any adverse change in markets, or serious drawbacks upon the profits realized. To this prosperity of the commercial interests the condition of agricultural affairs did not form en exception; all descriptions of agricultural produce brought remunerative prices, and, although some damage was sustained during the concluding operations of the harvest, yet in England the principal crops, the directors believe, proved fully an average. The directors have to add that during the past year a considerable increase has taken place in the deposits of the bank, as well as in its general transactions. This accession of business, combined vwith the high rate of interest which, with the exception of a short interval, prevailed throughout the year, has enabled the directors to place the following favoarable statement of account before the meeting:- 1856. £ s.d, Jan .-Itest, or undivided proflus, at 3Lst Dsecember, 1855, as exhibited at a.nual mesting in May, .8i ... .......... 211,195 6 5 Lz:ss.

After pay nient of the bonus the reserve fund will stand at 185,. In conclusion, the directors have to state that a bonus of 10 per cent. was given to the officers on their salaries at the close of the year, of which they have no doubt the proprietors wll approve." True bills were yesterday found by the Grand Jury, at the Central Criminal Court, against the parties charged wvith conspiring-to injure and defame the Bank of London. A writ has since been granted to the prosecutors, authorizing the removal of the indictment by certrai into the Court of Queen's 3ench, in order that it may be tried before a commsercial jUry. The followring relates to the National Brazilian A ssociation: "The committee of the National BraelSau Mining Association have received advices from Captain IHitchens to the 5th of April last. They are altogether satisfactory. Mx. Hitchens is now in possession of the whole of the properties and has also recovered the Cocaes and Cuiaba books of accounts and other documents and papers relating to the nines. The statements of account which accompany these despatches show a large balance in favour of the association from Mr. E. Oxenford. Small quantities of gold were being extracted from the d6bris of the Cocaes mine; but Mr. Hitchens expected to renew effective operations at the mine in a few days, as he was in expectation of the arrival of pumping apparatus from Rio de Janeiro, which would enable him to drain that part of the mine which has hitherto yielded considerable quantities of gold. He was also turning his attention to a developement of the Rotulo estate, consisting of 270 square miles of land, now increasing in value owing to the anticipated opening of the navigation of the river San Francisco." With regard to the failure mentioned yesterday of Messrs. Barker and Co., of Southwark, it is stated that, although they were described as timber and stave merchants, they have not been in that trade for more than two years past, their business having been then purchased by Messrs. H. and R. Fowler. Messrs. Barker's liabilities, it appears, amount to 70,0001.

TuREE RivErEs SETT,LE-T.-This vast tract of country-50,000 square miles-is destined at DO remote period to become of paramount importance, not only to the lumber merchant, but to the settler. A map of this hitl erto terra incognita is being engraved for the Crown Lands Department, and the world will then be better able to judge of its magnitude. One feature of this tract of country is its numerous lakes. When the lumberman ascends a tree to " prospect " his eye is dazzled with the glitter aU aound, and in some localities he may count from one int of vew as many as 50 lakes. Theee lakes are fiUed with the finest fish, irom the perch to the musslnonge ordi. narly weighing 50 pounds. Besides the above black bass, dorey, white fish, and salmon trout abound; of the latter sort I have seen some sold in theThreeRiverg market, which have been caught only 40 miles north from this place, weighing 341b. These fishare taken by theline and hook, generally baited with a young chub or pieco of fat pork. When the arms of the fisherman grow weary of hauling out his prey, he adopts a plan for his rolief which, I question, never entered the brain of Izaak Walton. He bends down a young sapling, either beech or maple, which he finds growing near the water's brink, and, attaching his line to the topmost branch, throws out his baited hook, which no sooner touches the surface than It is soized upon by some hungry cruiser; the sapling is allowed to rebound, and the captive is landed with a jerk.-Three Rivers Correspondent fo the Qana4ianm AWes.

PORTSMOUTH. The adjourned half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Great George-street, Westminster; Mr. Mangles in the chair. Mr. HORsy., the secretary, read the report, which stated that the cutting at Haslemere is the measure of tho time for the completion of the line, and about one-fourth of its contents remain still to be removed. The contractor has been enabled to make more rapid progress vith this cutting since he has been able to place a locomotive engine on the line, which has been the case for the past three months. A second locomotive engine has within the last few days been placed upon the 'vorks. Satisfactory progress is beino made with the only twvo other heavy works upon the line remaining to be comapleted-namely, the cuttings at Whitley and on Liss Commnon. The construction of the line is aiso being pushed at all material points, the contractor being at work at between 20 and 30 different places-. The whole may be completed by the end of the present year. Almost the *hole of the land for the line has been purchased and paid for. The issue of debentures to the amount authorized by the company's Acts-namely, 133,0001., and the other available means of the company will be more than sufficient to complete the whole of the company's undertaking. The refusal of the directors of the London and South-Western Railway Company to work the five miles of line between Godalming and Whitley has deterred the directors from puching on the works between those places to completion. The company have now, therefore, the choice of two alernatives, either to complete the Shalford extension, and thus connect the line with the Reading, Gnildford, and Reigate Railway, or to arrange terms with the Sonth-Western Company to work the line when it is completed to Petersfield or Havant. Since the last meeting the arrears due at that date have .ince been reduced by the sum of 68,0851., and proper measures have been taken for the recovery of theremaiRder. ThA directors bave found parties willing to take up the wbole of the unissued shares,-namely, 1,65S, and a portion of the forfeited shares as 5 per cent. preference shares, redeemable atpar within twro years. The directors and sotne of their friends have agreed to take upthe remainder of the forfeited shares as ordinary sbares, without loss to the company, but in this case sbareholders applying to the secretary within a n,onth from this date muay obtain their rateable proportion. The directors thought it right to give the holders of the forfeited shares another chance of redeeming them, and they have been informed by circular that it is still in their power to do so before they are re-issued to the parties who are prepared to take them, which option will remain open for one month from this date. The Bil before Parliament contains provisions which will enable the company to carryoutthe above financial arrangescents. The power to create preference shares will be liiated to oO,000I., to he raised on the abovo terms. When these arrangements have been carried out the company will be ina position to meet with ease the whole of its existing engagements, and as the directors trust, to brlng tho undertaking to a successful issue. The report of the engineets, Messrs Locke and Errington, states that 10 miles of permanent way have been laid, and materials are on the ground for laying seven more. Upwards. of 1,100 men and 150 horses are at present employed on the works. With due exertion on the part of the contractor the works may he finished by the end of this year, so as to open the line early next spring, The capital account to the 28th of February showed that 222,0521. had been received, and 213,870l'. expended, leaving a balance of 11,1821. at the banker's. TNhe QginTAIi, in mo*aifi be aoptioA QE to >poS stated that the directoys, theoir relatives, and friends -je1d very large suiii in the uadertaking, and therefore thatfr i,terests were idenitical withi those of the shareholders, 11 explained that iii thie present position of the eowmpay it might be injurious to their interests to answer every quLes. tion. that might be asked, and thereforo he hoped they vwould refrain froim pressing such questions at prefet.L In reply to Mr. Mowatt and other sbareholders it was stated that those clauses in the Bill now before Parliamaent for new lines, or matters likely to be opposed, would be withidrawn, so that it may be an unopposed Bill, n3ierely enabling theim to carry out their financial arrangements. would be subtmitted for their approval under the standing order of the House of Lords, at a special meeting convened for the purpose. It was intended in the re-isgue of the forfeited shares aLs ordinary shares of the company to appropriate the suins which bad b-en paid upon tbem as a kind of niscount, so that those who took those forfeitedt shares would havo to pay up the difference bBtween that amount and theo noxtinal amount of the share. Tile company would therefore receive the full amount onx each share. Resolutions were passea adooting the report;, confirming the forfeiture of certain shares; and n..thorizing the directors to raise 133, 000?. on debentitres, Art. Lacy was re.eIectedl auditor, and a vote of thanks to the chairmian and directors concluded the proceedings. E&ST KENT EXTENSION. A meeting of the inhabitants of Doyer was held on Wednesday in the 2l~ew Town-hall to consider the propriety of supporting the proposed extension line from Strood to St. 31ary Cray. The Mayor of Dover presided. The CuAmiriusAN stated that the meeting was convened b~ requisition, and he had great leaure~in complying w.Itf the wishes of-requisitionistp. Lord Sondes and other direc-. tors of the East Kent Company were present, and w'oulcl explin he dvanage ofthe ropsedlino, which, if *ganctiond b Paliaent,woud gve heman independent Iine, from overto te meropois. e wa hapy tosay 'thar, theMayr o Caaiswaspreentwit a iewtorepresent theintret tkeninthesuces ofthendrtainbytheir neigbors on the other side of the wtr lr.CM. LusHINGTON, a director, explained the difficulty the hd experienced from the state of the moneymoarket i proceeding with the works on the East Kent line, but he was happy to say that the first section of it froma Strood to Faversham would be opened for traffic in -Septembcr- next ; the remaining portion to Canterbury wouldl be opened snon after. The works on a, portion of the line from Canterbury to Dover were in progress, as could be seenL by the tunnel into Dover, the drift, way of which had beea opened from end to end, a distance of fiO yards. This was a matter of gpeat interest to ~over, and the promotersmnownasked their approval of a line fom Strood to St. Mary Cray, which would bring' them in connexion with a west-enid terminus in the met'ropolis, and enable them to reduce, the fares from L-ondon to Paris. The measure would be of the utmost importance to the t-own and harbour of Dover. Mlr. E. R. RICE moved a resolution to the effect that the meeting were deeply impressed with the importance of the proposed line fromi Strood to St. Mary Cray, as it -wouLId complete an independent railway commnunication from the metropolis8to the town and harbour of Dover. He believed it wvould -form the most direct route vid Calais t-o Paris and the north of Eiurope. Mr. FuN.Nis seconded the motion. The Mayor of C,%sAias said he was :happy to assuire them of the good feeling of the town he repre-sented towardis the undertaking. Their interests in this respect were mutual. He thought that a great mistake had been made in'the rojection of the lines destined to connect London and Paris., 'he longest instead of the shortest routes were selected; he trusted that that defect would soonibe remedied. Tie Emperor had recently ordered a line to be made from Calais to Boulogne, by which they would gain 45 miles ianthe distance betweent Calais and Paris. The works would be comranenced wyithin two months, and the line muist be finished in two yer,so they wouldl be ready for the new line to Dover. heecould be nao doubt that the proposed line from St. Mary Cray to Strood would, in connexion with the westend hnre,'form pert of the shortest and quickest routei between London and Paris. The people of Calais would giv them every assistance in their power, and he trusted that thie alliance between France and England would be of lon; duration. He had great confidence in the succeAs of their undertak-ing because liI. Crampton was connected ,with it. He had been deeply impressed with that genitleman's beautiful invention, by whilch he Perfected the sabmarine telegraph between England and, France Ile-had also facilitated the communication: by railway to Paris by means of his locomotive en0ies. The resolution wvas unanimously adopted. Sir B. DlEeiG, MYP., moved a resolution to the effect that iia consequence of the large traffic on the North. Kent line the proposed line was rendered necessary for the conveyance of the traffic to and from the .East Kent line. Mr. DENTi second'ed the motion, and, in doing so,. said that the line from the West-end of London to St. Mary Cray would be completed by the end of tl'is year. Air. T. I. CsAa.spTox, C.E., said that he hadl been engaged for the last ten years in improving and facilitating the mesans of communication between London and Eais Hfe had proved by the success of his engines on the Northern, of France line that high speeds were attainable on the narrow gauge. Ever since 1848 the whole of the expres service bad been performed by his engines on the NoTrthern of France line. His services in respect of establishing the submarine telegraph between Calais and Dover had 'beenL acknowledged in the most handsome maanner by a public dinner given to him at Calais. He was most anxious to c-)mplete what he had undertaken-namely, the shortest. and quickest route between London andl Paris. To iiisure high speed and safety they must have a clear road under their control, and he had no doubt that by that means, aud the cordial co-operation of the Northern. of France Railway, they would be enabled to reduce the time of transit between London and Paris to nine or ten hours. The resolution was then carried unanimously. Mr. B. OsnonNEs, M.?., advocated the testoration of the natural route between London and Paris tvi4 Dover and Calais. The trade of Dover had fallen ofl and that of Folkestone had vastly increased. He believed the Customs dues paid at Folk-estone were now ten times more than those at Dover. By a reduction of rates and increased speed they wrould bring a very large traffi to Dover. He would give the Bill every support in his, power, Other tresolations Wrere then passed in favour of the proposed route, and a petition to Parliament was unanimousmly approved and handed round for signature. Votes of thanks were passed to the Mayors of Calais and Dover, and the meeting separated, to visit the tuninel entrance of the new line into the town. TRtAFFIC RETURNS. Miles Pas- Mer- TotA, Total.

lZONDOB, FBIDAY, MA Y 15, 1857. In the House of Lords, last nightt The Earl of SHAFESBURY asked the LoRD C1ANCELLOR what progress had been made by the law officers of the CROWN in the inquiry into the legality of the opium trade in India? The LORD CHAi'cELLOr replied that a case had been drawn uip by the legal advisers of the Board of Control, which was about to be submitted to the law officers of the CRows. A discussion then arose on a motion made by lord CxAMoCARDE for papers connected with the ease of JIr. THouAs and BHAWAXNY LALLAI, which motion was withdrawn on an assurance given by Lord GRANvIu.e that the matter was not at present ripe for discussion. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Coxmmons, among a great variety of inquiries made of members of the Giovernment, was aw question put by Admiral WAxconrr respecting the troop steamvessel Transit, which elicited a further explanation from Sir C. WVoOD, who stated +hat his former explanation had been misappreheDded. Sir E. PBRRY moved for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the law of property as it affects married women and their separate earnings, observing that it was intended to apply a practical remedy for a g-rievance complained of,-a wife by the common Taw of England having no property whatever. In this respect our law was unlike the law of all other civilized nations, and ithad even departed from its own principles. He challenged English jurists to defend this anomaly, coatending that the pleas gererally put forward to justify it were untenable. He admitted the difficulty of legislating wisely upon this subject; the only effectual remedy was, as he proposed, to leave to husband and wife the entire enjoyment of their respective property so far as it was not affected by settlement befure marriage ; and it followed that, with the rights of property, all liabilities should accrue. The mot-on was seconded by Mr. DnummroxD, who, however, expressed a doubt whether the measure would be effectual without giving greater facilities for divorce a menwd et thoro. The ATTorNEY-GENERAL said, looking at the social aspect of the question, Sir ERSKiNE had taken upon himself a difficalt and onerous task, and he did not think a measure would receive much favour which went to create between husband and wife a comm nio bonorum, making each an independent person, and the women of England accountable for all their acts and responsible for all they said and did. Avowing a desire, however, that the law of this country should be made consistent with itself, he pointed out how far he was disposed to go in a measure of reform in this branch of the law. Sir J. PAxiNGToir hoped after what had been stated by the ATToarEY-GENEiAL that Sir E. PERRy would withdraw his Bil. After a few remarks by Mr. HoPr, Mr. M MmNis, and Mr. MALixs leave was given to bring in the Bill. Colonel BoLDEmo moved for a Select Comnmittee to inquire into the principle adopted for making contracts for the public departments, and the effect which the present system has upon the expenditure of public money. The motion was agreed to. Mr. FAGAN moved for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Act 17th and 18thVictoria, chap. 11, with a view to the abolition of ministers' money in Ireland. In reply to Mr. STAFFORD, Lord PALMERSTON said, as far as regarded the principle of this Bill, the Government were prepared to concur with it. Mr. DIsRAELI observed that the principle struck at the root of all church property, and if this principle were approved by the Government the measure should be brought forward, not by a private member, but by the Government, who were bound in fairness to take care that the House should have an eerly opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the subject. After some further discussion leave was given to introduce the Bill. The LoRD-ADvoCATs moved for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the law for the registration of persons entitled to vote in the election of members to serve in Parliament for counties in Scotland. A few remarks were made by Mr. BLAcBnuBN, Mr. G. DUNDAs, Mr. KnrNANu, and Mr. CRAuFURD, and the motion was agreed to. Mr. MASSEY obtained leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Burial Acts, and Lord ELono a Bil to alter and amend the laws regulating the medical profession. Captain MAaA_N moved the second reading of the Grand Juries (Ireland) Act (1836) Amendmaent Bill. After a brief conversation the Bill was read a second time. The House adjourned at 20 minutes to 7 o'clock.
It has been remarked that in war a victory is often but the beginning of difficulties. To take advantage of the triumph, and to rise to the level of new opportunities, is the test of generalship. The present position of the British force in Persia requires the highest qualities in the commander, and we fully believe that the skill and resolution of Sir JAmxs OUTRAM will not be found wanting. It is rather an argument against those Indian enthusiasts who urge the annexation of the Gulf shores to the British empire that at this moment of victory and successful negotiation the necessity of occupying those shores for a few months of hot weather should cause alarm to every one connected with the administration of the army. Their position may be explained in a few words. The little inland sea called the Persian Gulf is notorious for a clima%e which tries the health even of those who have withstood all the influences of Caleatta or Rangoon. Shut in as it is by desert tracts, every wvind is a sirocco, and, wherever the coast is low, fevers in the most malignant forms prevail. Bushire and Karrack are said to be insupportable after April, and European troops landed on the coast must necessarily advance into the interior, and encamp on as high and healthy ground as can be obtained. But now we are in a most embarrassing position. The treaty signed at Paris stipulated an armistice pending the ratification at Teheran. The news of this treaty reached the British camp near Mohammerah on the 4+h of April. From that day it will have been impossible for Sir JAMES OUTRAM to advance into the interior, and to take up a position on I any spot where a show of occupation is made by the enemy. It will be against the terms of the treaty to drive in a single Persian outpost. The same rule wili hold good at Bushire. There was an intention that immediately after the capture of Mohauamerah one, or more regiments should be sent back to Bushire, an advance made from the coast, and the Persian army driven beyond the passes. But on both points we are now compelled to inactivity. If the armistice be carried out to the letter we have only the ground we stand upon. The enemy may approach and hold p3sitionz within sight of our army; and it will be against the text of the treaty for us to go beyond their lines even for provisions or forage. Now, when the news of the affair of Mohammerah was received, it was hoped by those conversant with the locality that the General would at once occupy the country through which the Karoon flows. The intblligence that a corps had been directed against Ahwaz and had driven off a Persian army of overwhelming numbers was considered as a prelude to the further news. that the whole British force had advanced into the interior and taken up positions on some healthy spot more easily supplied with necessaries than Mohammerah itself. But, unfortunately, the British corps returned from Ahwaz after having seen the Persians flying towards the northward, and, if we may trust succeeding information, the enemy has again taken eourage and reoccupied the country. There, according to the literal terms of the treaty, they have a right to remain; and thus, after having fought three actions and possessed ourselves of two importaut bases of operation, we may find ourselves confined by a beaten enemy to the narrow circuit of our own camps, and exposed to all the e-vils of a torrid climate, a low unhealtly situation, and the want of many necessaries which can only be supplied by the country itself. This is the difficulty which the military authorities will have to confront. With respect to the moral influence of the recent operations there cannot be a doubt. Buahire and Mohammerah were both fortified with all the skill Persia could afford, and they were defended by troops of fair determination. Yet the first capitulated to the fire of a steam equadron,whilebIohammerah,though the garrison Btood to their gans for five hours and a half, was taken with a heavy loss to the defenders, and the Persian army outside was so demoralized ; that, though 14,000 strong, it retreated before a few hundred British troops. The Government of Teheran may consequently have learnt a lesson, Iand, if the truth can reach a despotic ear, the SHAY, rmay feel convinced that this country is at any time able to threaten him with the loss of important and highly-valued provinces. But we can hardly be zaid to have reaped the full fruits of victory. Although we moat heartily agree with the policy which has determined that no acquisition of territory should be made on the Gulf, yet we must regret that there have been no express stipulations as to the rights of the occupying army pending the ratification of the treaty and the evacuation of Herat. The British have a right to hold their positions, but no express permission is given them to establish themselves in convenient and healthy spots. It must, therefore, be left to the sklil and tact of the General to negotiate this affair with the Persian authorities. Evidently the moral right is on our side. The treaty declares that the British forces shall not quit the country until certain stipulations are carried out. Now, the right of occupation involves the right of doing that which will make the occupation possible. The British force is, in fact, legaly and by the consent of both nations retained in Persia; it has, therefore, as much right there as the soldiers of the SnAH, and, as the latter have the power of choosing their summer quarters, there seems no reason why Sir JA3ms OUTRAN should not insist on being allowed to take up a position some miles in the interior, on condition o' respecting the sovereign rights of the Persian Government, and giving fair remuneration for services or supplies. We trust that no excess of punctilio will prevent the British General from providing for the health and wellbeing of his troops. Such. a deplorable event as the double suicide of General STALKER, and Commodore ETun:mRDGE shows the necessity of seeking at once for a refuge from the dangers of the climate. There can be lit'le doubt that each of these unhappy ac:s was the result of mental alienation, induced by a fevered brain. Low fever and marsh fever are known to act in thbis manner on the sufferer, who is excited to fury by any untoward circumstance, or reduced to melancholy and despair by delay or discouragement. Responsibility and the necessity of taking a resolution then become too great a burden for human nature to bear. To withdraw k s forces from influences which have already proved so calamitous is a necessary duty, and the diplomatic skill and intimate knowledge of theEasterr character wbich are possessed by Sir JNrms OumTRA will, no doubt, be well employed on this occasion. Thou,gh we rejoice in the conclusion of the war, and are not disposed to quarrel with the Treaty of Paris, we certainly could have wished a larger discretion had been left to the British General, and that he had not been, as it were, struck motionless by the news of peace,-forbidden to advance, and yet not permitted to retire. In case of any subterfuge or delay on the part of the Persiars we trust Sir JrAns OUTRAns will take to himself full liberty of action. If the ratification be delayed, or alterations in the treaty demanded,-if Tartars are to come and go during three or four months between Teheran and London, the British Commander should not be compelled to hold his ground merely on the sufferance of a barbarian army, which he has already thrice driven before him. Sir JAMEs OuTRAW was furnished with fullU powers to negotiate on his own accourt, and, if the exercise of these powers bas been anticipated by diplomatic action in Europe, they are yet still in existence. We may therefore hope that our Government will justify the General in dealing boldly and firmly with the difficulties of his position.
Of course it is very hard to wait. No matter whether you have to wa;t in certainty or in doubt ; whether for the fulfilment of a promise or the arrival of a <'shipload of money," waiting is tedious, and one feels that patience is a virtue. Young ROPEFUL cannot wait for dinner, and spoils his appetite and digestion with apples and bread and butter. Older grown, he cannot wait for his majority, and borrows. Tell people to wait, and they answer that life is all waiting; that they have waited long enough, and waiting makes fools. Yet waiting is the school of moral strength. The grandest achievements have to be waited for. Small minds are always fizzing and leaking; so when the time comes they are found either stale or empty. Even eloquence, to be effective, requires intervals of suppression during which the speaker " coils himself up," as a great master expresses it, and reserves himself for the climax. So we do but observe the universal law, which applies with the greatest force to the greatest things, when we suggest to our Parliamentary Reformers " Wait!" Wait a little, Lord R. GRosvFyoR; wait a little, Mlr. LooWE EING. Why in such a hurry to anticipate the Reform BiU which we have all made up our minds for next Session? It is mere political incontinence, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Pray consider that the Reform Bill, when it comes, will contain a good many disagreeables; it will be too much for the weaker brethren, too little for the stronger; too rich, or too insipid. If, then, there does happen to be any point which hits the general taste, that ought to be reserved, in order to carry off the rest. We want a Reform Bill as comprehensive, as large, as full of good provisions, as we can make it; and here ere two members already at work robbing it by anticipation, trying to pick out its plums, to prove what good boys they are. Lord ROBERT GBosvENOR's proposal is good enough, and he has every right to make it, when the time comes. There can be no doubt that any allowance for election expenses is contrary to the spirit of the Reform Bill, and does virtually defeat its intention in the metropolitan and other large constituencies. When it comes to several thousand electors poor enough and mean enough, and politically indifferent enough, to expect to be carried to the poll, money of course carries the day, and both the Chartist'and the Country Gentleman must give wayto the uan who happens to abound iii that article. But there is no reason* in this little island of ours why everybody should ilot have a polling-place within a walk, and why invalids and aged men should not have their votes taken, if necewsary, at home. These are mere mattera of arrangement. Every union, every perish, supplies the organization for the purpose, and it is mere barbarism and stapidity to drag a voter even 10 mniles off to do what can be done next door, or at his own door. Multipl; the polling-places, or extend the system of polling, but save the candidates from the cost, nuisance, and ambiguity of " travelling expenses." It will often happen that the best man to represent the coanty may not have a couple of thousands to spere, simply because he is in the habit of applying his thousands to some better purpose than an indirect form of bribery. But there is something ridiculous in a burly farmer, who comes to market every week and is always on the move, driving to the polling-place in his cart or his gig, and expecting an allowance for " travelling expenses." No doubt, then, this o-aght to be Btopped as a rule, and whether there should be any exception made in favour of votera actually distant and incapable of paying their own way to the poD is a matter of no great consideration. So, again, the property qualification, which Mr. LocxK Kixc proposes to Iabolish, is afarce, and as a farce ought not to bo retained in a serious, practical constitution, liko ours. But the stronger the case for these two I measures, the stronger also the case for leaving I them to the Reform Bill that is to be. What we say is, " Expect that Reform Bill. Recognize its "approacb. Therefore, wait for it, and do nothing "to diminish its attractions." In the jndgment of any ordinary man these minor questions merge in the greater one of the Second Reform Bil. If a man is indifferent to that measure, if he does not really expect it, and doubts the sincerity of Government on the subject, or if he has made up his mind that the battle of Parliamentary Reform must be fought in detail, step by step>, then, of course, it is quite consistent to lose no time, a-ed do a little bit by bit Reform even in this small Session. They who proceed on this supposition are likely to have plcnty of support, for the hard-headed Conservatives know well enough that bit by bit concession i6 the right way, and the only way, to spoil the public appetite for a comprehensive and effectual measure. It is not as if these two questions about travelling expenses and the property qualification were practically very important. The first may not actually affect half-a-dozen returns; that is, a general election may puss without halfa-dozen likely candidates having been deterred by the prospect of travelling expenses or crippled in the contest. The second measure is nmuch more one of decorum than of practical consequence, as probably not a single man was prevented from offering himself at the last election by the want of a formal qualification. It is plainly unreasonable, then, that reorms likely to affect only half-a-dozen returns or so should be allowed to preoccupy the ground and blunt the edge of appetite on the eve of a general measure which is expected to take away some fifty seats and give them to worthier populations, besides changes that must inevitably tell on tBe returns. It was commonly said that the Reform Bill of 1832 was precipitated and even aggravated by the fatal obstinacy with which our high Tory and military statesmen set themselves aga;nst every smaller demand. If this supposition be correct, then it follows that tffo or three petty reforms every Session would have staved off the Reform Bill, and the middle of t: e century would have found us still haggling about the Hundred of Bassetlaw or the delinquencies of a Sir MAxNAssEH LopEz. Fortunately, the Duke of WRTWGTON was i;solved there should be no reform, and accordingly we had it. For the present, and with a view to the same result, we recommend the same course to Lord RoBERT GRosvEwon and Mr. Locxr iNG. Let us have no Reform now, and we shall all the sooner and surer have a real Reform Bill.
That Mrs. BACoN, being at the time insane, destroyed her two children, and that the father was free from al blood-guiltiness, no rational person can doubt who reads even the evidence for the prosecution taken on Wednesday at the Central Criminal Court. Guilty, no doubt, the man ws of uttering a tissue of clumsy falsehoods to screen himself from suspicion when he thought that suspicion was dogging his heels; but then that is a very different matter. We heartiy rejoice, for the honour of human nature, that this terrible affair has been so far explained, for, tragical as it was in the acting and in the result, there is a wide difference between the case Of a maniac who takes the lives of her children in a fit of frenzy and that of a father who, in full possession of his reaon, plans and executes the murder of his young children. The unfortunate woman is an object of the deepest compassion. Hsppily, in this instance we cannot entertsin a mcoment's hesitation as to the condition of ber mind at the t;me the fatal act was committed. We know that she was actually mad during a portion of last ye2r-having, in fact, only been discharged from St. Lake's Asylum in October last, and she is mad now. We are not, therefore, dealing with one of those cases in which the madness of the criminal is iu'erred from the very enormity of the crime. We are travellir!! from mania to crime-not from crime to mania. In was, in fact, no mother's hand wh:ch did this blooay work; all that constitated the wretched creature a woman and mother had disappeared. There was the outward form of humanity indeed, but the informing spirit had fled. The story, now thrt we have got at the truth of it, is not a very long, nor a very complEcated one. TnOMAS Furznn BACON, described as a smith, is 32 years of age; MARTHA BACON, his wife, is in her 27th year. It appears that he was in receip- of good wages and in full employment until the time of the tragical occurrence of which we are about to speak. They had been married about seven years, and had two children. .A fter the birth of her last child M's. BACON was " very strange in " her manrer." She was under delusions, and had threatered to destroy the lives of her dearest relatives. The end of all this sorrow was, that she was confined in St. Luke's Asylum from the month of June until the I 7th of October of last year. She then came back to her family. When in her right mind, accordinlg to the testimony of witnesses at the trial, she was a most kind and affectionate mother. THoxAs BACON, however, the husband, seems to have been very uneasy about her, and this uneasiness was openly expressed just before the 28th of last December, the date of the tragedy. They lived at that time at 4, Four Acre-street, Lambeth. On the 28th, which was a Sunday, the two prisonera had gone on a visit to the house of a relative, and it was there anranged that a woman named HARRET MUiNRo sbould go to their house on the following day, to remain with Mrs. BACON while her husband was absent on some job of work at Reigate. On the Monday early he quitted his home, and, as we can now have-no doubt,'Mrs. BACON was left with the living' children. The same day, according to appointment, HAaxrnr MurN;o, the person of whom we have spoken above, -went to the house in Four Acre-street. about 4 or' 5 oblock in the afternoon. She knocked,sheknockled repeated4y-and, arclding to ber own account, lingered about the entrance to the pre|mises for two or three hours. At this time-it must have been very dark at that season of the year-the wretched maniac was cowering somewhere within the house. She had kIlled one of her children on the groumd floor and another in the room above. Fire or candle would have betrayed her presence.. At half-past 9 at night ImanRIET MxNRO returned, but still could get no answer. The next day, Tuesday, accompanied by her mother, she went back to Four Acre-street, and at the corner of the street they met MAnTHA BACON with a halfsovereign and a book in her hand. At first she was quiet, and said, in reply to a question, that she had been at home throughout the previous night, but then suddenly burst out with, " Some one " had got into the house by the back-window, and "a man had killed the two children and had cut "her throat, and she was going to pay her rent "and tell her landlord what had happened." The two women instantly accompanied her backc to the house, and they found that as far as one of the children was concerned her statement was too true, whoever the murderer might have been. Upon going into the back room oa the groundfloor they saw the little boy-he was about three or four years old-sitting on a chair, his head resting on a table, and with his throat cut. They were so shocked at this dismal spectacle that they do not appear to have carried their search further. Subsequently a police constable was fetched, and then the body of the little girl was found lying upstairs on the floor. Her throat, too, was cut, and she was quite dead. A surgeon was soon summoned, and he gave it as his opinion before the Court that the children when he saw them had been dead about twenty-four hoiurs. BACON, the father, had been considerably more than twenty-four hours away from home. The wretched woman then repeated her statement, that the man who had got in through the back window had attempted to cut her throat, and showed a few trifling scratches as evidence of the violence to which she had been subjected. They were obviously the work of her own hands. She had also twisted a piece of cord or string round her throat, in order, as she supposed, to produce the external appearances of strangulation, but the trick was so shallow that it could not for a moment deceive a practised eye. When the wretebed woman was searcbed at the police-station in Kennington-lane her underclothing was found to be stained with blood, but there were no blood-marks upon her outward garments. There were, too, upon her hands bloodstains, which had been only partially washed off. There were two bloody knives on the table in the room where the dead boy lay, and an apron stained with blood. The appearances presented by the back window entirely negatived the hypothesis that it had been violently burst open, and that somebody had entered the premises by this way from without. There was dast on the window-sill, which had not been disturbed in the slightest manner, and there were no marks of footsteps on the soft ground outside the window. The tale, in point of fact, was a pure fable, not worbhy of one moment's serious discussion. How, it may be asked, under such a state of facts as we have described, came THomss BACON to be mixed up v,;th the charge at all ? He had displayed considerable agitation while at his work on the Monday at Reigate, but surely not more than legitima'e anxiety for the precarious condition of his wife might bave warranted. Then the poor mad creature, in her frenzy, had written a letter to the magistrate, charging her husband with the murder. Then, when he found suspicion was thickening around his path, he was guilty of the indescribable folly of telling a parcel of lies in order to favour the supposition that the bloody deed was in reality the work of burglars, who had entered the house, and, after they had killed the children, had carried off some clothing, money, a watch, &c. Then, when he was questioned as to a cut on his finger, he said at first that he had cut himself when he was carving some meat; then that he had met with the accident while whittling a piece of wood. Many other such ridiculous prevarications and falselhoods there were, which are replly unworthy of repetition, as they only proved, in the aggregate, that a stupid fellow had tried in a very clumsy manner to lie his way out of a difficulty. There was not a tittle of real esidence to connect him with tbe murder, and he was very properly acquitted. There could not, on the other hand, exist the shadow of a doubt that his wretched wife had in a fit of madneEs destroyed the two children. She has been sentenced accordingly to be detained during the pleasure of the CROwN. It is at least satisfactory that the mystery which hung over this tragical occurrence has been so completely cleared up.
Mr. Commissioner HOLROY.D is entitled to the public gratitude for the admirable judgment which he pronounced yesterday in the affair of the Royal British Bank. Ee is about to direct that copies of the examinations talken under the bankruptcy shall be transmitted to the ATToR=yNBGENErAl2 'with a view to the institution o' criminal proceedings. "I do not," said the learned Commissioner, " believe that a scane of " greater reckesse, fraxud, and criminality of " conduct in the managemeit of a banking "establishment was ever exhibited in a court of " justice than is disclosed by the examinations "taken in this court under the adjudication of "bankruptcy against the Royal British Bank, and I "mayobserve that theseexaminationswillbe admis"sible against the parties, in case of a prosecution." Why, then, should Sir RiCHARD BETE hesitate for one single moment on such a matter ? We are confident that we are but giving utterance to the expressed opinions of the ablest criminal lawyers in the country when we say that a prosezution of these great criminals cau be conducted to a successful issue. Yesterday, at the Old Bailey, the BAcoNs were on their trial,-that was wel enough. The New Court, however, umder the auspices of the RECORDEB, was occupied with the trial of a wretched creature who had stolen six pairs of boots. The Third Court, presided over by the Co2NMo-N-SEnJnT, expended its powers upon a lad who had, as it was said, wrongfuUy given a receipt for 71. 1s. 8d. It turned out that he had done nothing of the sort. All this while the ESDAILES, and STAPLETON?S, and CAIERONS, and COAuruRDs, and Bnowxs, and PzwArTs, whose conduct, as the Commissioner tells us, has been tainted with such gross " recklessness, fraud, and criminality," are walking about the streets. One of them, indeed, occupies a seat in Parliament for the town of Berwick. Sir RIcHARD BxTuELL, we repeat it, will be himself guilty of a heinous neglect of duty if he does not t3ke the most instant and effectual measures to carry into effect the recommendations of Mfr Commissioner HoLroYD. We should fail in giving full expression to public feeling with regard to this matter if we did not add that Mr. LINKLATIE has earned the higbeat approbation by the spirit and intelligence he has displayed in the conduct of the recent inquiry.

The majority of the Select Committee of the Senate of Pennsylvania on the resolutions in the Dred Scott case had made a lengthy and able report, accompanied by resolutions declaring that the opinion of the Supreme Court enounced principles in palpable opposition to the judicial and legislative history of the Union, and in viohlaionof the plain provisions of the constitution of the United States; that the opinion, except on the question of jurisdictiop, being delivered in a case over which the Court admuittedit had no jurisdiction, may be justly regarded as obita dicta and inoperative as lawv; that the five Juldges who concurred in the same opinion made a wanton attack enO the sovereignty of the Free States and an impotent attempt to nullify the established laws of the country, and, by extrajudicial action, caused unnecessary excitement in the public mindin regard tD the subject of slavery, and had thereby forfeited the confidence and respect due to their exalted station. At Kansas a Pro-Slavery Convention to nominate a candidate for delegate to Congress is to be held on July 2.

THE WAR WITH PERSIA. We have received the following telegraphic de-apatch from our Vienna correspondent:- " VIENNA, THURSDAY EVENING, MAY 14.

MR. TY. RUSSELL'S LECTURBS. Yesterday evening, in the presence of an audience as slumerous as on Monday, Mr. W. Russell resumed the narraldve of his Eastern expedition, beginning at the pause, or, -us he calls it, the "settled btillness," that followed the battle of the Alma, and ending with the affair of Balaklava, As he had now entered completely upon his important topic, there was less of light introductory matter than in tho first lecture, and his desoription of the grave events of which he was a witness left littlo room for the details of his 0ivn personal inconveniences. An encomium on the mnagnanimity of the English to their lZallen foes was followed by a lamentation that the advan. &age gained by the victory of the Alma was not more 8peedily foUowed up. MIr. Russell would not venture Ao throw blamue on any party, but asserted that future historians would decide through whose fault so brilliant a victory led to no result, and the ecattered masses of the Russiaus were allowed to collect and renew their opposition to the alies. Delay-procrastination had, he said, been the characteristio of the war from the beginning to the end, and was always reappearing in some new form. The depardure from the AIma afforded opportuuity for a harrowing description of the masses of dead and " acres" of wounded left behind, while something of the ludicrous was mingled 'with his accou at of the condition in which a viUage on the Eatcha had been found, after it had been demolished by the Cossacks. Once it might have been compared to some gashionable watering-place in the south of England, now it was a aotley mass of ruins and articles of luxury, heaped ilogether ia grotesque disorder. A broken grand piano on 'which an English officer played "God save the Queen,') beneath a picture of the Russian Emperor, into whose suouth some one had irreverently thrust a cabbage stump, 'was an excellent little Hogarthian episode in the general *picture. Unfortunatel,, fruit was plentiful and accessible' ns well as upholstery, in this melancholy place, and a re ipp,earance of the cholera in the army was the result of an imprudent pa rticipation in the bounties -of nature. It was in the neighbourhood of 'the Katcha that Mr. Rusell was himself taken i11, and he touchingly adverted to the emotions he eaxperienced when, lying on the ground exhausted, he saw the troops march past him without any one stopping to offer yLim assistance, til a benevolent drummer proved an honour. -able exception ,o the rest. To the common belief that war ievelopes Ithe finest feelings of our nature he was by no :means dispostd to give his assent. The first sight of Sebas-topol as the axmy approached the Tohernayn on its way from -the Alma was made especiaDy impressive by the coun 4enancoof the Tartar who pointed it out, and denoted by -his awe-stricken manner that yonder was the stronghold of 4he Russian oppressor. The story of the march to Balaklava was enlivened by a variety of amusing anecdotes; but the most important remark was to the effect that the English were "jockeyed" by the French through the whole of the movenent, the lutter always keeping to the right of the former, and being, therefore, always guarded by the sea and the feet. lNor vwas it In this respect only that the French had -the advantage. When the landing of the artillery began 4hey were tho first, and they always, in fact, "gave -time" to their allies. As for the artllery which was nsed in the siege, Mr. Russell admuitLed that it was con. siderable for Woolwich and for a people in which a fac'ion was opposed to the military defences of the country, but that measured by the strength of Sebastopol its deficiency was positively disgraceful. In the aiege 'opsrations Mr. Russell considered that the English -showed -their superiority to the French; indeed, they apparently taught the French how to construct magazines proof against the shells of the enemy. The charge of the ,cavalry at Balaklava was descri'ed with singular animation, und the lectarer, conquering a certain nervousness which aiad from time to timae been apparent in the earlier part of his course, followed the moveuments of the English with all -the fluency of enthusiasm, and communicated his own feelings to his hearers. The " Light Brigade," he contended, 'was not lost, but would live for ever in the memory of Britons as a noble monument of that high sense of duty that *disrgards even the first law of natnre-selt-preservation. To-morrow (Saturday) Mr. Russell will bring his narzative to a conclusion.
TNz RO}AL MATERW1TY CHAItyrY.-The cen-texary anniversary festival of the Rvyal Maternity Charity wm celebrated on Wednesday evening by a banquet at the JLondon Tavern. Tbe Duke of Argyll K1.T., took the ch,ir ,on the occasioP, And the liSt of stwaids included the natoes of Lord B1. Grosvenor. M.P., Sir J. W. Lubbock, Bart.. Dr. W. Cotton, Dr. Blundell, Dr. Griffith, Dr. Davis, Dr. -Croft, and other eminent and influential personames. T'he X oyal Materrity Charity having now endured a century and so stood the test of time, hardly needs to be further commended to the favour of the public. It has afforded .esnntial medical relief to nearly 400,000 necessitous married women at their own hounes (a very admirable geature of the institution), and 3,297 poor families were -thus asisted last year. The average number of patients .annually relieved of late years appears to be about 3 00, {he number hlavlug been simply reduced by the opening of ,stmilsr charities for the relief of indigent married wonmen. 'The noble chairman, in advocating the clains of the charity to public support, dwelt upon its perfect organi7ation, and txpatiated in tho warmest terms upon its nierits and useful.ness. Tho appeal of the noble Duke was responded to by a subscription of 5501., including a donation of 501. from the ,Queen. The dinner was served in the usual style of the tendon Tavern, under the 3managenment of Mr. Bathe and Mr. Funge. Mr. Barker officiated as toastmaster.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. I (FRObOM OtiT OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Trhe following a.ppeared in our second edition of yesterday :-l k'AAt.i WEDNESDAXY, aAY TS, 5 P.M. By a fiction w,ich] great personaes find now and then very convenient, the Grand Duke Constantine will be supposed to quit Paris two days before he bodily turns his back on it. An apartment has been taken at the fotel du Louvre for him and two or three of his attendants for that time, and, like Jupiter when bent on a private excursion earthward, hu will lay aside his splendour for 48 hours in order to run ab..ut Paris unencumbered by state. He anticipates a good deal of amusement, and doubtless of instruction, by thus descending to private life. He wiU prob4bly visit during that short holyday the theatres of the 13oulevards, may dine at a 40soUS resta7?URant, or, seated among bonns, tourlourow, and moaulards, enjoy a laugh at the pleasantries of Gringalet, or sympathize with the domestic sorrows of Guignol. In a word, the Grand Dluke enters private life for a space, and he is determined to make the most of his liberty. So far as the people at large are concerned, it is undeniable that the visit of the Russian Prince is a failure. It is probable that among the great personages of tho day the case is different. By thiem be may be admired and courted and bepraised; and, in return, the Moniteur may soon contain a column or two of announcements that the Emperor has been pleased to permit General This, Count That, and Baron Other, and other people of merit, to accept the St. Andrew's, St. Miebael's, and other orders granted to certain of the Emperor's subjects by the Czar on the demand of the Grand Duke. Sic itur ad astra! What unoccupi:d cormer will be found on breasts which even now resemble a house overinsured, so covered are they with stars and crosses, it is difficult to inmagn. The masses, however, on whom no ray falls of all this starry glory, and who can only look from a distance at the galaxy, think otherwise. They think of the sons, the brothers, and the friends who fell before the waUs of Sebastopol, or were frozen to death in the trenches, or who perished miserably by disease or privation. They feel little sympatby or enthusiasm at the sight of a Russian Grand Duke, and the reports which vary the amusenents of Fontainebleau, or the high jinks of Villeneuve l'Etang, may by this time have informed the, Court that the majority of Parisians think the pressing invitations to the Russian PrincB4 to visit France came rather too soon after these terrible campaigns, and that but little regard has been paid to their feelings in the matter. There is no animosity towards an enemy who is no longer hostile, but they say that it is hardly consistent with decorum to show all this homase at a moment when the memory of all that happened in the Crimea is still fresh in their minds. These are the remarks you now and then hear among the crowd, and it is not certain that the dis- play of Russian stars and crosses on the breasts of a few dozendignitaries will diminish their bitterness. The Emperor has committed a fault, and it is probable that by this time he is aware of it. The followig particulars of the stag-hunt at Pontainebleau are taken from Galignani's Messenger:- " The grand stag-hunt, which inaugurated the residence of bhe Court at this Imperial Palace, was of a most inter. eating description. The weather was delightful, and the appearance of the forest most pioturesque, with its light green covering just assuming the strength and beauty of summer foliage. The sun was not too bright, and a gentle breeze fanned the air; in fact, a more propitious day could not be wished for. The place of rendezvous was the Carrefour de la Croix de St. HEreim, situated on the road from Fontainebleau to Nemours. At 11 o'clock a number of carriages of all kinds arrived from every quarters and took up their station at each side of tho road nea the Carrefour. Admirably mounted horsemen came in every instant, apparently the cavaliers of the fashionably-dressed ladies in the carriages. This constant series of rrivals con- stunted a scene of the greatest animation, and the excitement was increased when, at a little after 12, there were seen advancing a number of hounds led in leashes by three of the Imperial grooms on foot, accompanied bytwo mounted huntsmen. These men were all dressed in the Emperor's hunting livery-green coat trimmed with silver-bce, red un. mentionables, and laced hat. The huntsmen had each his born suspended from the shoulder, and the hunting-banger vras suspended on the left side. At a quarter-past 1 the Imperial party made their appearance from the Palace, which they leftby tbeCourdo Chev i Blano. The cort6ge was composed of several chars-a-bane and open carriages. In thefirst char a--banc were the Emperor and Empre rs, occupying thefront seast, with the G rand Duke Constantine andthe Prince of Nassau behind, their Majosties and the Princes being in the Court hunting costume, consisting of a green coat with gold lace, the waistcoat red, the lower part of the dress being white, with high hunting boots. The hat Louis XV., a hanger, and a whip completed the ostume. As soon as their Majesties arrived at the Carrefour de St. Herem they and their more immediate party got on horsebacl, grooms having brought horses to the spot a few minutes before. A eonsiderable number of the guests fol. lowed the example of their Majesties, horses being provided for all; and, as the Empress thought fit to follow the ehase on horseback, of course it was the fashion for the ladies to follow the example, and ae ordingly a considerable number of them appeared on h orseback, and all in uniform. The laddies costume was exactly of the same oharacter as that of the gentlemen, the habit being green, with crimson waistcoat, hat and feather, and gold lace. The Empress's horse 'was a most beautiful animal, romarkable for spirit, but Her Majesty sat him fearlessly, and proved herself a most accomplished horsewoman. When all the guests had got on horse. bask, every ono in the eostume prescribed by etiquette, the sight was an exeedingly striking one; and the eager bay. ing of the hounds, the impatiene of the horses, the animation of the riders, and the noble forest for the back scene, wore in themselves worth coming 20 leagues to see, But no great time was afforded for admiring the scone, as the Emperor at once gave the signal, and the chase commenced. The Imperial party took what is known by the name of the Route Ronde, and almost immediately the stag was roused at no great distance from the trysting p llace . The Emperor, Empress, Grand Duke, and Prince of Nassau were in the first line, etiquette as wrell as politeness interdic ing their being headed at the commencement of the hunt; af erwvards, when the incidents might become more uultiplied, why, whyrs com'e calras. Near the Epperor's party rode Marshal Magnau, the grand huntsnman, on an imilienselY Powerful horFe, which seemed quite up to his gi eat weiglit on the turf, though it might be a very different *hing were the gallant Marshal in Leicestershire. General N'ey, first bintanran, wvac also in close attendance on their Majesties. Behind came the other personson horseback, and laswt of all a numbei of chars-d-banc, containing such 'mu mnbers of the Imperial party as loved better to trust their liibs to steel springs and strong wheels than to tle wild cUrVrting s of somounruly steed. Atfirstonlytheprivilered persons were allowed to pass along the wide alleys of the forest in the im mediate neighbosmrhood of the place of reedezvous; but afterwards, when the hunt stretched nut in the distance, all attempts at hindrance were nseleFs, s ad whtn at last all advanced some few were fortunate enough to hit on a side path, bringing them nearthat the s-tag had taken. It was generally thought that the stag would make at once for the Mare aux B Bcufs, and then stand at bay; and accordingly we all made for that POint. But we soon learned that the animal had gone straight forward in the direction of the Carrefour of the Croix de Souvray. There we met with another disappoint. niemet, for one of the Piqueurs informed us that the stag had wade a etotur, end doubled back towards the spot from which it started. It was then about 3 o'clock. The staw on approaohing its lair, finding itself rather clorely pres sed by the dogs, again made for the open forest at greater speed than previously, and tut beth horses and riders ot their mettle. At last the whole hunt became more or less dispersed, but as tb h animal had returned to Its startingplace the greater number of thn riders hri degrees arrived at the Ca rrefourrde St. Herein, and at about 4 o'clock the Emperor an d his party made their appearance in the distance. Presently they drew nearer, an. while the Empress, the Gran d Duke, and the Prince of' Nassal continued the chase in the direti iof the Croix du Grand Maitre- H is Majest' came and gave an account to the persons a ambleddfr-iwhat had taken place. The run, it seeeed, had been a splendid one, and the stag wasetha to al appearancefresher anc&. stronger than at starting, and no one could sAy wjiea theaanimal wouldbbe forced,' as the phrase is, orif that nmosmt desirable event would take place at all. But to the heated crowd of fashionables a roun d the stag was not at that moment of so much importance as a drink of wine and water. The day had become ex- ceedingly wasin, anid the exertion rendered any pot s abole resreshment most desirable. Fortunately a fourgoea tas near, and in a moment every one was attacklug the contents of a hamper flied with wine, and sLnoter containing beer. Again and again they drank, and to teek parche' VIsp the gla's of weak wine and water seem'A like iatotar. At last the party turnedl their horses' 'heads towards the Palace, 'while the Emperor, accomPpi'ie4l by Mlarshal Matnan, galloped off towards the Goore aux Lonips in the honpe of falling in with the chi%se. The stag and dogs had, however, long dashed beyoixhlg.°-spot, and it wvas iuseless to think of going further -onk mzee chance. So the Eniperor returned to the Palace, , there the Empreas and her party had already arrived, at a' Jout 5 o'clock. At the moment I write no one can sr.y that the stag has not been forred, but, if so, the cureie, or breaking-up of the animal, will take place to-night in t .e coult of the Palace.'' It is said that the Minister v'j Marine has decided that, notwithsttading. the success attending the building of the frigates A udacieuse, Impetueuse, Souve'.'ain,% 1wd,TX1b.m a, Re EuEgenie (frigates of 69. guns), in ftituro none but small frigates shall be coliltructed, capable of navigating shaUow waters. | The Papal Government iS at present occupied with a new organization of the Catholic dioceses in China. This measure is to be followed by the organizatior, on new bases of the Catholic missions in the extreme east. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has received by the Clyde, which arrived at Marseilles on Sunday last, despatcbes from M. Gobineau, French Charge dAffaires at Teheran. They are dated the 3d of April, and consequently before the arrival at Teheran of the treaty of peace signed in Paris. They leave no doubt, however, of the intention of the Shah to terminate the war with Great Britain as quickly as possible. Despatches have been received from M. deCourcy, the French Charge d'Affaires in China. These despatches did not arrive by the ordinary channel. The Government has decided that until the establishment of a penal colony in New Caledonia, which cannot be accomplished in less than two years, convicts shall continue to be transported to Cayenne. The following are the amended provisions of the Bill for imposing a Duty on Transferable Securities, as given in the budget for 1858:- " Jndependently of the duties established by the law of 5th June, 1850, every transfer of shares, promise of shares, or bonds, in any company or undertaking whatsoever, v'ill be subjected from the 1st July next to a transfer duty of 20 centimes per 100L of the value negotiated. Shares to bearer, and those the transfdr of which can be effected without any entry being made In the books of the company, are to be liable to an annual and obligatory duty of 12 centimes per l00f. of the capital of the said securities,. caloulated on the average price during the preceding year. The duty on nominative securities which cannot be negotiated 'without an entry In the books of the company-wiU be payable at the moment of transfer. All securities liable to the annual duty are to pay the amount quarterly, and at the end of each quarter the companies are bound to give an account of the said receipts. In companies which admit. the conversion of securities to bearer into nominative ones. rnd vwee ersa, the transfer duty is to be paid on the said conversion, but thab act may be effected without charge for the space of three months from the date of the present law.

VIENNA, MBY 1L The Agricultural Eixhibition (Lax,dwirthschaftliche Ausstellung), which began the day before yesterday, far surpasses anything of the kind that has ever been seen in this part of the world. The place of exhibition is the Augarten, a fine large public garden in the Leopoldstadt suburb, and the arrangements made in it are such that they equally satisfy the exhibitors and the public. The larger animals are in separate stalls,under spacious and lofty sheds, the sheep and swine in pens and styes; the larger machines, such as loco-noXiies, mowing, reaping, and thrashing machines, in the open air; the smaller agricultural tools in sheds, open only on one side; and the agricultural produce in a large building, which, when the Augarten was a fashionable resort, served as a summer residence for some member of the Imperial family. On the whole, the horned cattle are inferior to what we are accustomed to seein England, but still there are some animals of the Swiss, Tyrolese, and Styrian races, which are greatly admired by the numerous connoisseurs who have come from all parts of Europe. There are some fat oxen and heifers of great size, and a Hungarian ox, which was bred on one of the estates of Baron Sina, is a truly gigantic animaL The show of horses is very poor, and the foreign public is greatly disappointed that there are no specimens of the trae Polish, Hungarian, and Transylvanian races. There are some few half-bred horses, in which the cross between the English and indigenous races has succeeded, but it is evident that the Austrians have not yet learned how to employ the foreign blood to advantage. In general, the half-breeds are either deficient in bone and substance, or clumsy " chuck-headed"' animals, which it is positively disagreeable to look at. The best cross appears to be between the English and Bohemian or Moravian races, and the worst that between the English and Styrian. The Styrian draught horses would afford great satisfaction to the London brewers, and omnibus proprietors would not object to the produce of stallions belonging to the Imperial studs and Austrian and Bohemian mares. The sheep excite the admiration of all foreigners, and the Austrian agriculturists have exhibited specimens which have wool of a length, closeness, and fineness of which few British agriculturists have any idea. Almost all the swine are of the Yorksliire, Suflolk, and Essex races, but there is one of pure Austrian descent which is a most remarkable animal. It is two years and a half old, has been fatted for more than a year, and weighs no less than 7 1-5 cwt. Messrs. Clayton, Shutcleworth, and Co., Messrs. Garrett and Son, Messrs Boward, of Bedford, and 21 other English firms have sent various kinds of machines and tools, and greatly annoyed they must be to find that the Austrian manufacturers had already imitatedsomewhat coarsely and clumsily it is true-their newest inventions. The ploughs and harrows of iesers. Howard are much admired by the Austriaa agriculturists; and it is not surprising that such is the case, for those exhibited by the Vienna makers are very clumsy and unwieldy machines. One agdcultural tool used in Austria that deserves to be intrcduced into England is a peculiar kind of wooden fo-lk tipped with steeL It is here employed for lifting barley, heavy kinds of clover, &c. Baron Ward, who was formerly Minister of State in Parma, and is now a kind of Austrian Mechi, has invented a mowing machine, of which eQhas sluch a high opinion that he offers to bet 1,000Q. tlhat no one can bring anything into the field to equal it. The productions of the Austriau woods ard forests excite general and well-deserved admiration. There are specimens of oak timber 72 French feet in length, which were taken from the virgin forests in Slavonia and CrOatia. As soon as t'cere is railway communicationbetween the forests in question and the port of Fiume Euitish shipbu lders wrill do well to make the neazer acquaint- ante of their proprietors. During thelast two days the Viennese have been so much occupiedi withtheir Exhibition and Mr. Murphy, the gtantthat they have hardly observed that the.CreditBBsuk shares ' f which the majority of. them are holders, have lieen from 22611. to 249fi.

CLOSE OF THE CHAMBERS. The session of the Prussian Chambers was closed on the 12th inst. by a Royal message read by D$ de ManteuffeL The message enumerates the various measures adopted during the session; it mentions likewise the measures which have not passed; it alludes to the bill relative to the prohibition of payments in foreign notes, and expresse the hope that a general understanding on that measure wMil be come to with other States. The message expresses satisfaction at the conclusion of the negotiations for the settlement of the Sound Dues. The Royal message does not make any allusion to foreign politics. We learn by telegraph that the festivities at Berlin in honour of Prince Napoleon were continued. The King and Queen honoured with their presence the ball given in the Prince's honour by Baron de Moustier, the French Ambassador. A grand military review was held on the 12th. The Prince of Prussia gave a grand gala banquet to the French Prince on the 13th. Prince Napoleon was to leave on Thursday, the 14th, for Dresden. Her Majesty the Queen of Prussia left Berlin on the 13th for the Castle of Pillnitz, near Dresden. NAPLES. (FROM OUR owN COIRRPONDENT.) NAPLES, MAY 7. All the ceremonies connected with the miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius have ended. They were performed last Saturday, and the King and all the Royal Family went in state on Tuesday morning ".to venerate," so says the official journal, "the miraculous relics of our most glorious patron." Illuminations for three nights were enforced by the police and clergy, and flowerpots ordered by the same authorities to be taken in from the balconies of the streets through which the King had to pass. There is an old order of the police to this effect, not always rigidly enforced, but 1 have been informed of some houses where the police gave specific directions for that purpose. His Majesty, who came in from Caserta in the morning, accompanied by a squadron of cavalry, returned in the evening, having first received a visit from the exKing of Bavaria, and returned it. The secret press of the Neapolitan Government is unusually active, and the members of the police distribute its works. There are three " Mementoes" in circulation: one specially directed against Lord Palmerston, in most abusive terms; another crying up the financial condition, which is full of;palpable falsehoods; the third is creating an immense sensation. It contains a fierce attack on the Pope for baptizing the Imperial Prince of France and forming a compact with the enemies of his country, who keep him a prisoner in the Quirinai. The French Government and people are the most given to lies of any in Europe-enemies of religion; the Sovereign of England is the Queen of the schism of the faith, and the English are insular barbarians. The Pope is then exhorted to fly to Gaeta, as the Aventine of the Churcb. Cavour is the special object of the writer's indignation. He is the ecourge of Italy, who has sacrificed his country to English Jews, and borrowed money and religion of barbarous islanders. A paraUel is then drawn between Ferdinand II. and Victor Emmanuel. The former has laboured for the independence of Italy, has created a vast army and a vast fleet, and wishes to see al foreigners driven from Italy; the latter has sold himself to the allies. Victor Emmanuel is then called upon to bind himself in strict alliance with the Pope-to visit Naples, which will save him; and, on the first attempt of the foreigner to destroy the independence of Naples, to march on Milan; but the first step is to drive out Cavour, and take Manin and Iamianii as counciUlors. The spirit of the pamphlet is therefore " Ferdinand It. the Intrepid;the Italians against theworld." "Italyforthe Italians" is the cry. Such is tlhe tone of this ex'raordinary production, of which it is only neessary to say that it is circulated by authority in a country which byitsSovereigns had been kept in suibjection to Austria, aud whose troops, reluctantly sent forth, were almost immediately recalled from the war of independence in 1848. We may regard this as the latest, but most superficial ruse of the Government of the Two Sicilies. The officials are hard at work in studying Morse's telegraphic machine, one of which has already arrived, and it is hoped that in a month we may be able to communicate with London in 20 minutes. The telegraph line to Reggio is completed, but not yet open to the public. From Reggio to Mesaina the lines are not yet laid down. The Government required guarantees for the safety of the line for a year, which M. de Norman was unwiling to give, but it will be laid down in a short time, I think. It is rumoured that an offer has been made to the Government to lay down a line from Sicily to Malta, which would be of great European importance, but no reply has been given. Of railways little is to be said-of the Brindisi line for the present I do sot speak. M. Bayard is here, with the intention of selling his interest in the CasteHlamare line. M. Tagliacet wil be the probable purchaser. He brings with him, too, a French engineer to survey the concession made to D'Agiout of a line from Salerno to Taranto. The line to Ceprano, on the Roman frontier, goes on slowly, though men were working at four points. That to Avellino, a military line, pro'ressea rapidly. In short, there is a vast deal of ta&, but very little done, as might be expected in a country were miracles are almost of daily occurrence. The Financial "Memento" makes it a boast that King Ferdinand has made the country independent of the foreigner by creating a manufactory at Pietrarsa. flails are made there for the Government lines at an expense of 271. the ton: they might be imported for 131. The Neapolitan military engineers make fortunes at the expense of the nation. I regret to say that the medical report of the English gentleman who was assaulted last week is that he was in extremity last night. Hle had recovered from the blow on the head (from a bludgeon or a knife, but is now suffering from inflammation of the bowels, caused probably by being kicked or jumped upon. Since this event a French gentleman and his wife have been stopped on the Strada Maria Teresa, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening. They were assaulted by two men, one of whom presented a knife. Those here who denounce publicity, who are for maklng things pleasant, and painting everything co.esw de rose, say that, after all, worse things occur in London. There is a vast difference in the cases. ln London we nave a population of neanty 3,000,000 of people, enjoying the very excess. of liberty; here we have not one-eighth of th population, and tbey are in- a state of slaver3.. The ews of violence in Lonon occlr in spit.of.awell-paid, respectable, respecd, and active jody.of men.. Such cases occur in Naples in conaequence of an ill-paid, illselected body, who as:e ever ready to take a bribe and elose their eyes,, and whoso mission is less to ptotect~ persoig and ;uoperty tha o sy upon thoie .whoare obnoxious bo GXovemuaent.~ Jnlndon we have the utmost ;ublicity given to every fact; in Naples none. Bare wre have a poice perlect for political espionap, but a nulity for everything else, and. whi politicl prisoners are rotting in. prln, codemned or uncondemned, or not even ; nterrogated, criminals are pardoned and thrown upon the streets to commemorate the birtl of a Bourbon Prnce. My latest report Of 'the health of Mr. Blandford, the gentleman w,io was assaulted, is, that he is dying. The ComraiNwary of Police employed to investigate the affai: reports that 40 men had been arrested at differont quarters, as capable of committing a similar aggression; but that, as Mr. Blandford has been unable to make any deposition, it will be difficult to 1bAd the criminals. Under the circumstances, the authorities are doing the best that can be done. Mr. Barber, ouir Consul-General, has demanded of the Prefect of Police that a rewazd be offered publicly for the apprehension of the guilty parties, and a free pardon to any one who will give evidence. The Centaur has just left Naples on another cruise. P.S. At the last momeu I have to communicate that AU. Blandforcl ha& iu died,
XarIBITION OF ART TREASURES AT MANCHESTEB. (Continued from l&c Ti2me of Monday, May 11.) It is an obvious advantage of the chronolocal arrangement which has been adopted in the n- cheater galleries that it enables the eye to take in at a glance .he broad distinguishing characteristics of successive p eriods and shools of art. From perception of these distinctivo characters to appreciation of the influences of schoolsc upon each other is a ateDp which cannot be taken by help of the eye alone. But even for this sucha chronological arrangement is most helpful. Down to Masaccio we have seen the Byzantine influence still dominantinspite of the large infusion of naturalism and independent invention due to Giotto and his pupils. The art of the painter up to the end of the fourteenth century may be said to bave been all but exclusively dedicated to devotional purposes. But portraiture was resorted to by Giotto in his religious compositions and in the few civil and political allegories painted above the magistrats's seat or in the civic council-room, on which, as work nearly akin to relgious the painter of the 14th century was; not uinfrequentiy employed. Besides this we know Giotto paintcd independent portraits, as those of his great contemporaries, vante, Guido Cavalcante, and Bunetto Latini, which it has been the fortune of our century to recover under the whitewash of the Bargello at Florence. But of portraitare on moveable panels we know of no example earlier than Masaccio and his school, and during the whole of the 15th century, though portraits are not uncommon, the spectmens of art which have, survived are chiefly those appropriated to the direct service of religion. This in apparent on a survey of the Tuscan and Umbrian pictures which occupy the wall of Saloon A to the point where the Panshanger Raphaels and the great Fra Bartolommeo, from the same collection, tell us that we have reached the third of the great Epochs of painting. Up to this point the application of an increasingly truthful representation to the early types and traditional subjects of sacred pictures has not served to overpower the spirituality of sentimeat which stiU breathes a pure and holy air round virgin and saint and martyr. It has only rendered that spirituality less and less ascetic and mystical, and more and more human. The altar-piece of Cosimo Roselli (62) in the seraphic beauty of the angels who surround its central figure, in the graceful sway of their floating form, and in the rapt reverence of St. John and St. Dominic, St. Peter and St. Jerome, wbo fiU the foreground, shows how much scope there was at this time for the painter's art in its noblest resources for devotional expression. The picture3 of Sandro Boticelli (52, 53, 58) are pervaded by one type of female beauty, the source of which was no doubt that fair Simonetta of whom there is alovelyportraitfrom this painter's hand in the possession of Colonel Anthony Sterling. Here we already see the painter transferring to the Virgin Mother the beauties of an earthly faceone, perhaps, with admiration for which his own heart was ftlled. The transition was easy and inevitable from this employment of a lovely woman as the model of the Virgin to painting the Virgin for the sake of the loveliness that could be represented under her image. Individual dispositions might react against this general tendency of art. A pure mystic like Fra Beato might stiUl resort to his imagination, lifted up by prayer into pious ecstacy, for the angel faces with which he has peopled his " Paradise" (36), or the meek and modest loveliness of his Madonna sitting on her throne, and girt by cherubim and seraphim (37). But in every school there are sure to be more Fra Filippos than Fra Beatos-more in whom the flesh rules the spirit than in whom the spirit puts the flesh under its yoke. Even Perugino, whom critics have been accustomed to qvo e as a master of devotional expression, and whose exquisite series of Predella pictures here shown (74 et seq.) seem to be bathed in the very atmosphere of purity and Christian tenderness, was accused af impiety-indeed of Atheism. And it was against the art of this century, religious as we are used to consider it, and religious as it seems in this exhibition of its works, that -avonarola preached his stern crusade in 1497, and lighted the bonfires in the market-place of Florence, at which many of the most excellent works of hlorentine artists in painting and sculpture, i"cluding the busts and portraits of many beautiful Florentine women, were committed to the flames. It is clear, in fact, that by the side of the religious art there was a secular or sensual art, of which but for this destruction more extensive remains might have survived. But besides the art employed on pictures, devotional or secular, it must not be forgotten that the artist and the artificer at this period were separated by no distinct line of dewarcation. The statutes of the " Arti de Dipintori" or Companyof St. Luke, at Florence, in 1386, show that the brotherhood admitted, besides painters, trunkmai;ers, gilders, varnishers, swddlers, and cutle-s. A painting by Pollajuolo in this exhibition (49) of "David with his sling," on a wedge-shaped leathern shield, may help to show how the painter's art was connected with such handicrafts. fhe goldsmith's craft especially has furnished to the history of painting the best known names of this century, as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Orcagna, Ghirlandajo, Pollajuolo, Botticeli, Verrochio, and Francis, and manyothers. The painter, besides his work in the church, was employed to decorate the huge and richly carved chests, in which the trousseaux of the bride or the sumptuous wardrobes of the noble orcitizen were stored away. The bedstead and the standing cupboard, the jewel casket, and the lute, the saddleframe and the knightly banner, were all ornamented with pictures. There was art in design, and painting as an embellishment of design, but there was no art for mere sake. And this brings us to the fundamental distinction between those times and our own, in their relation to the painter and his work. His work, in a word, had then a purpo.e. It might be used, while books were few and reading a rare accomplishment, to tell some story out of Holy Writ, which all who saw might understand, or to lift up the heart^ of the faithful in an altarpiece, to record some pious vow,or to adorna family burial-place, or the meeting-room of a religious aEsociation, or to depict some scene of warning against unrighteous judgment or false witness in a hall of justice, or to clothe some place of devotion from the vignette over the porch to the vaulting of the apse with type and anti-type, vwith the history of the Saviour from the cradle to the cross, with the miracles of the founder of an order, the rapt beauty of virgin Saints, the enduring courage of martyrs, the unearthly glories of the blessed, or the ghostly penalties of the condemned. These were the noblest uses of arb. Then, for humbler service it was called in to adorn every article of household use, to hang the outside of houses with heraldic devices, garlands, pictured histories, or patron saints, to paint the,bamner for the church procession, to devise or deorate the-pageauts for a trade company, to emblazon tbhe. device on a knight's shield, or to colour the achievement on his surc0at. The artist rorked, like: the. a]tificr in his bottcg--his shop; as yet studis were not. In that shop a hirlandajo or a Veroechiewas ready for any job, down to the paintise of bucket-hoops. In short, art was part and parcel of daily lte, and artists were employed to make the useful also beautiful. It is intgresting inthecollectionof taphael's works here co1lected tegether to trawe the painter through his various sttagesofdevelopment. We seehimstillp, lealmer in the aehoj of Perugin-o in the great " Cruci. zion'>(152), from the Feseh eollectibn.$ contributQ,a by ord.Ward, which bjears dzte 1500, when l:phaul was it y.easaold, four years before his 'aot visir to Flonnce. Here we still see immaturity and weakness in all the mere difflcult parts of the -a,rk, especially in the extremnitied;wbie in the "l*gend af the MintoLa." (9}) we may trace the joint -.eork of the Raphael of 21, and of his friend 'Fra Baolomeo, by that time returned to his art 1'toa the Dominin cells at Prato. The advancjv in this noble work on the feebleness of the Pet hcc "Crucifixion" is very marked. There is notl.ing finer in al here attributed to Raphael than the rapt faoe and ecstatic action of the St. Francis in. this picture, as he watebes the ascending Virytn, who drops her girdle to St. Thomas. Nor have we seen anything from the hand of Fr Bartolommeo which leads us to believe him capable of having painted this picture singlehanded. The picture ivas originally in the Cathedral of Pisa, and is contributed to the ibition by the Earl of Warwick. We may tri the progress of Raphael another step forward in the larger Paushanger Madonna, which bears the date 1508, the year its painter was first surmsoued to Rome by JTulin tI, This picture is of undoubted authenticita- n is iwl kiern fr the engraving; but for exiression we must confeu it .appears to us inferior'to the smaller ap-a undabtl picture of the same subject froin the same ollection In the former of the two there ix something at 1one overcharged and commonplace in the infantine joy of the child, which has nothing raysteriout or superhuman in it. The mother's expreaion, thougt pure, suggests nothing. You cannot read her thoughts through her eyes. But in the smaller picture, if the child bWa mere, earthly babe, the mother's face at least wears a perfect expression of dreamy maternal teiiderneu. You feel her intense enjoyment of the pr.ure of the infant fingers upon her neck, of the slight weight of the soft little foot upon her hand. Ineffable motherly content looks out of her quiet eyesr and irradiates her serene smile. There is no supernaturalism in either picture. In the Virgi -we wer none of ihat brooding and perplexed awe which lies like a cloud around the' eyes of the Mdonna di San Siato; in the Divine Child none of the self-dependence which gives sternness to theface, and dignity to the attitude of the infant God in the, same-picture. This is the work of the young Raphael, for whose serene spirit, as yet purs of Roman passion or R2oman intrigue and jealousy, religion is still summed up in love; and the Madonna is rather the ideal of maternal affectionm than the central figure of a theological system. The large composition of the Madonna with the infant Christ and St. John, by Fra Bartolommec (92), though it has suffered sad ravage frona the cleaners, is a noble example of the broad and free handling off the master, and reveals to us the source of that fuller colour and bolder treatment which we trace in the works of ERaphael between 1504 and 1508. Of Leonardo, that great master who, with Raphael and Michael Angelo, carried paillting to ita third great stage, we have here at leait two works which may with some confidence be pronounced genuine-a study for the head of the "Vierge aux Rochers" and a "S t. Jerome." This last is hung too high _ar inspectiow of the date, but surely 1465 must be a misprint in the catalogue. If this date be genuine and correctly printed, the picture cannot be Loe6nardo's, for he was born in 1452. Be this as it may, the picture has the characteristics of the master, his roundness, his deicately graduated but strongly marked light and shade, and it has dsakened in tone throughout, as Leonardo's genuine works are unfortunatelv apt to do, from the under-paintingVcoming through. The study for the "lierge aux Rocherse is very interesting, as showing a genuine work in lprogres& The head is laid inin brown, on an asphalte ground, which is used for the half tint, the lights, being worked into this in pare white. The glazing colours would come over this under-painting. Step by step as we go on woe may see naturalias encroaching upon spiritualism. Alreadly, bythe influence of Fra Bartolommeo, the yoing Raphaelhaa passed for ever from the mannerism of his Perugian masters; is boldly introducing purely human expressions into his holiest acenes; is painting his Christ as like a real infant ag he can, in limb3 action, and lookl; is bringing down the nother of the Godhead as near as he can to the type of mere lovely youithful maternity. ComAre his treatment of the theme with Crivelli's for example, or Fra. Angelico's. In the hands of Leonardo the expression of solidity, by means of chiaroscuro, is evidently beconing a more important object than the' expression of any religioussentimentwhatevee; and even the Last Supper itself is treated rather as the most dramatic incident of a familiar cycle than as the foundationL of the greatest mystery of the Church. This exhibition is lucky enough to poess what themost competent critics seem agreed there is every reason to consider a genuine example of Michael Angelo (100). The picture was bought as a Gbirlandajo, but it is certain that no, existing 'work of that master indicates any such commaand of large and dignified ideal forms as appears in this unfinished work,which represents a Eoly amHil witk four angels holding acrolls. The under-painting of the flesh is pure terra-verte, and its. effiects. on the finished Sigures are apuparent in the reddening of the shadows. Tlhe strongest argu.- rent for thhose wo cau feel thee characteristiforms of masters is the difficulty of finding any othername but MichaelAngelo7sbibanswerto thequestion who, of Ghirlandajo's timer coul have painted these two angels ? But grand as the forms of this work are, we can trace no spirituality in its expressions. Of the scholars of Leonardo there are several excellent examples, some attributed to the masterhimaselM Of course, in haDging the pictures and in compiling the cdtalogue the coimmittee- liave considered themselves bound to adopt the names- nder which pictures fare forwarded by their owners. Luclily, we are restrained by no such courtesy. Wecan feel no hesitation, for- example, in givng to Andrea Solario that sweet,. golden-haire& head (82) which claims rank as- a Leonardo. There is only need to oompare it with the' head of- Herodias, correctly ascribedl to Solaio, which hangs in the fint vestibule. There-are several Luinis, one quite worthy: to. take its place by the side of the fine work of that master-in our Wational Gallery-and a characteristicM Baco DOggione. There are, besides, two. so calle examples o£ that rare Lombard master, Gaudeuio.Fermri though we. do not feel the same confidence in-their authenticityas we do in that o. the luin i lust referd& to.

COURT OF COMMON COU.CIL. .SYR WILLIAM MAGNAY. Thze following is an abstract of the proceedings which took Pace, cat the Court,of Common coanill on Thursaday, the 7th inst., and which were concluded Yesterday, upon the dis. cussion of the following motion, whicht was submiitted to the CGotrt by Mr. Blake:- "That this Coturt has le3in"d with astonl3lhmrent and regret thLat by a decree of the Court of Appeal Of Brussels. dated 27th February, is5t9 isir Willilam Maceaq. b3ronet an alderman and magistrate of this city. bs. teen adjudged o' Aefault guilty of fraud, and con. d.r.amoo tothree Years insprisosnnent and a tine of 3 Coot. Thai this Coart has learned from its law ofuocers with equai astori'hsxeot and re5ret that the London Corporation Act, 1849, 12th and J.-th Of Victoria, c1p. 94. fre, ed with the especial view of seenring thle pe.rit' of Ihis corr-orti.i, by decl 'ing any of it-s members disqualified elso sitall be consited of fra"ld. is ine list case inoperative, because thle coniviction has beo by a for eign Court. "That iSir. William Magnap net having taken any steps fos- the no cation of the judgment against tios, this Court feels bound to ex reos its opinion that he ought nto longer to occupy the position of an a~dcr. ment of this city, and to rcquestlttat he wal relinqs4sh that office."1 Mr. Ross.-Before the discussion comnmences I should fike the 94th section of the 12th end 13th of Victoria read. Mr. Woodthorpe : "1And be it enact,ed, that If anoy peron holding the Office of alder. m=aulo common councilresn fer the city of London shall deoctos him. sel& or shall he decl'red bankrupt or insolvent, or shall apply to take or take the benefit of a,,y Act for the relief of insolvent debtors, or strol make moy composition with his creditors. or shall altogether absenit himself from his dsuty for moeer than Dix calendar months con. secatively, suulees Prevenited by ilUnee.s, or other reasonable cause, or shall be convicted of fraud, or of any crlime, then end In every or any snob camseirtch person shalt thereupon immediately become disqualifled, cod eball cease to bold the offc of alderman or commnon councilmen as the case may be, and the Courl of Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London shall thereupon forthwith adjudge the maid office to be vacant." Mlr. lRos.s.-The subject-matt-er of the motion now about to beo brought before the Court having been referred to the law officers, and they having stated that a conviction by a foreign Court is not within the meaning of that statute, I want to ask whetber it is competent for any member to bring forward a motioni imputing fraud or anything else affecting the private charaoter of any other member of this Court. The LORD MAYOIt.-No doubt it is competent for the Court to enter upon this quiestion, and they are quite in a situation to ask Sir William Magnay to resign the office (f alderman if they think proper. Mr. BLAK~E said that in 1849 the Court had had occasion to apply to Parliamient respecting the extension Of their isuffrage ; andl with a view of entitling themrselvesl to as large a shore of the public respect as possible they sought to hedge round the qualification of members for a seat in that assembly by every precautionary maeasure that could securo the honour and respectability of their body, On the 12th of Mdarch a copy of the MAfornn Chrsonsicle was placedi in his bands, which contained a paragraph to the effect that Sir William Magnay and two other gentlemen had been tried in tlheir absence by the Court of Appeal in Brussels on a charge of fraud, and hating been found guiltby wvere sentenced to imprisonment and fine. UPon his motion the statement conatained in the newspaper in question -was referred to the law officers, who ha r_ eported that the section of the Act -which had just been read did not apply to a conviction by a foreign Court. Mr. Blake then proceeded to read copious extracts from statements made in the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Com-mon Council by Sir WiIliamA Magnay, in which the latter gave his reasons for not attending to take his trial upon the hearing of the appeal which had been instituted after acquittal. Sir William Mao-nay had stated that the reason for his not appearing to take his second trial was that one of his codirectors in the Great Luxembourg Rlaiway Company had, notwithstanding the assurance of one Of the Belgiasi officers ,who had visited this country that he might proceed to Brussels with safety, boon arrested on crosing the frontier, and detained 13 weeks in prisosi previously to being tried, and he (Sir W. hiagna6y) had stated that had he proceeded thither himself he would, in all probability, have experienced similar treatment. It had been thought necessary that the City Solicitor, for the purpose of ascertaininig the real state of circumstances, should put himself in communication with a professional gentleman of high position and reputation in Brussels, who was unconnected with the Great Luxembourg Raalway, or with aniy of the parties against whomn proceed. ings had been instituted. Mr. Blake proceeded to read clocumients from the professional gentleman at Brussels, detailing t'se charges upon which Sir William Magnisy, with others, had been tried; one of the communications statinag that the observations attributed to Sir Willia Magnay as having been made in the Court of Aldermen upont the subject of the treatment experienced by Mr. Ash. ,well -wile. in prison were not correct, and that had ho proceeded to Brussels to take his second trial he would have had every facUlty affordaedahim of producing any wvitnesses ho thought proper for the purpose of clearing himself of the offence with which he was charged. He then read tlhe legal docu ments having reference to the charge -which had ben preferred against Sir William Mlagnay,tIlie substance of whiceh has already appeared in our columns in the discussions which have taken place upon the subject in the Courts of Aldermen and Comamon Counoil. Sir IV,illiamd Magnay had weighed his reputation against his liberty. He hadL secured his liberty, and now ho would endeavour to sustain his reputation as best he could, not whero he coald have done so writh faGllity, hut in this country, where be was surrounded with every difficulty. Sir Wiliam Masnay had filled the office of chief magistrate of tlse city, and had received honours fromn his Sovereigni, not on account of any peculiar merit of his own, but out of compliment to the corporation. (Hear, hear.) lIt beboved him, therefore, knowing that the very enjoyment of those lionours gave him the means of doing acts of which he had been convicted b y a foreign tribunal-it was his bounden duty, when he could noflonger reflect honour upon the corporation, in retuirn for that which he had purchaDed by his connexion with themn, to separate hiniseif- froin thetii. (Hear, hear,) Mr. Blake Concluded by esldag the Court to agree with hiis motion, Mr. BESI.EY seconded the motion. Mr. J. J. MILLARD proposed the following amendiment "Thatillsrepugant o th tow nd uage fths c0untrytin the case of aBriishhornsubectresientin aglad t upoldthe sentenice of a foeigncrimnal ouriimpl becuse t isa jugmeoandtherei)y to abrogatethe righ of inqiry mb te cIrcustances, moeeseialy as regars a Belgan judgent, undr whichit may aebe ob"That the judgment by default in question was given on the public poceutor's aPPealg agatiAs one of acquittal from charges which ha'S ben revionsly ignored by two successive trbunals, which acqulittal had teen gained notwirbstsndlsg that the evidence on the Past of the tro3scution bad been Precused by the arrest of one of the defendants (in violation, of an authorized assurance of safety), and under the followiDg circrusmtance3: "On PoassIng lbs Belgian frontier In April, 1855, his luggage was, reized his papers and poersn were searched, and himself remaoved to a criminal pirison.

TIhe 29th article of the Code Napoleon enractedl-" That when a party condemned by contumacy shall appear voluntarily at any timie within five,years, to be computed from the date of the executionk of the judgnseist, or when he shall have been seized and taken prisoner during that interval, the judgnenit shall be quashed as of full right, the accuised shall he restored to the possession of his property, he shall ha tried afresh, and if by the niew judgisient he shall be condermned to the same penalty, or to a different one carrying with it equally a civil death, it shall only reckon from the day of tho executson of the new judgnsent."

Lord Louglsborough had said that" enal laws of foreign cuntries ae strictl local, ad affect nothing more than they can reach and can be seized byvirtue of their authoity."Agai, r.Justie Euer ha laiddown "it is geerl pincpl tbt he ena lws f oe ouns- cannot be tak-en notioe of in another." Martins, the eminent jurist, maintained the same position as an axiom of the law of nations, saying that " A sentence against any one in a foreign country is not held to involve even his honour in his own country." So far from this countr being disposed to regard the dica of foreign Courts as binding here, they bad m some instances suppressed by treaty both the jurisdiction of foreign Courts and the terms of the foreign law evon in foreign countries. Thus, in Turkev the only Courts holding any Jurisdiction over British subJCCtS inthat country -were the British Consular Courts, and the only laws those of Great Britain. He submitted tlat maxims of law as to penal statutes must be construed strictly. In providing disabilities on conviction the Legislature must at least restrict their application to a conviction founded on principles of national equity, and analogous in al essential characteristics to the prnciples which govern criminal proceedings in this country. The Legislature must upholD its own judicial principles, and it could not contemplato any recognition of convictions based on evidence inadmissible by the law of England, inasmuch as that recognition would be tantamount to the introduction into this country of foreign principles of justice in direct cenflict with those which prevailed under our own laws. He submitted that according to the language of the authorities he had quoted the Court of Common Council had nothing whatever to do with the conviction of Sir W. llasay bya foroign court, and that, be it remembered, after he ad been previously tried and acquitted Mr. Millard, after quoting extracts from a printed statement of Mr. Ashwell, detailing the ill-treatment he had experienced while in confinement in Brussels, as a justification for Sir W. Magnay's not trasting himself a second time in tho hands of the Belgian authorities, ooncluded by asking thu Court to support his amendment. (Hear, hcar.) Mr. A?mmtTowf said he had pleasure in seconding the racuedmeut, wvhich he trusted the Court would unanimously ado0pt. Heo asked, was Sir W. hlaguay now having a fairtrial? One wvould snppose that forom the course the piroccedingq had -takeni they vere about to convictb him without heX1% him., (Hear, bear.) The pislntl proceedinog hadbeen otted n 00so c-e of a statement Ina newspaper that SirT y1naejoin ad been guilty of a frauulet mncevrein rspet t a antof 58,0001., and that the acoLt f hescopect toad been fra(unl~y mnade up. In 1852 he (Mr. AnIerton) was aPPointedl an nuditor of the Grea Luxembour.g IallwaY ComPanY, and he was so still. I[n 18&3 his name appeared to the bssUance.shieet -which was then presented to the shareholders and puablished, and if any fraud existed in respect to that balance-sheet he was answerable for that as well as for every account that had been submitted to the E.hareholders from that timne to the present. He contended, however, that no fraud had been perpetrated by any of the dlirectors of the company. That there had been a wanton exPenditure of money, and that proTer precatutions in respect to loans had not been taken, hie did not deny. Butt where were to be found railroad companies that had not comnmitted similar faults ? (Heax, hear.) In regard to the sum of 58, OCOI. alleged to have been miisappropriatedhby the direct-ors, Sir W. Megnay being one of them, he (Mr. An. derton) held in his hand the original report siged by himself and two other auditors-men as resp ectable as any in that court-which certified that the bala nce-sheet was correct. Re contended that if anY Parties wero ag. grie,ved it was the shareholders, and it restedI wihthem to institute proceedings against the directors if they thought proper to do so. kHe believed Sir W. Magnay to be perfectly innocent of the charges made agaist him. M. FRYv.-In the event Of Mr. Milard's motion being lost I shall give notice of the following motion : "That it be referred to a select coDMmittee to exaMine into the 3nature sant) truth ot the charges brought against sir Willis,alraga -i,d to report to this Ooast to what extent toose eharges, if true, affect bla moral cbaracter, and whether in consequence it has becomie necessary that be should be caUled upon to resign hIs gown as an lder- (Rlear, hear.) Mr. ABR.aAHAM said he hoped the Court would e Dress its disapprobation of the psition in which Sir WMRiam Magnay had placed himsef and until they had done that they would not have discharged their duty. Mr. BERN AL said that the proper course for Sir-W. Magnay to have adopted uponL the present Occasion would have been to move an amaendment the very reverse of the motion of Mr. Blake. (Hear, hear.) The amendment, instead of seeking to exonerate Sir W. Magnay from blamne, entire.ly avoided the question at issue, and it did not relieve the Court from the necessity of pronouncing an opinion as to the honour or dishonour of certain practices of which SirW. 2dlagnay was alleged to have been guilty. He was in favour of the motion of Mr. Blake. Mr. ROwE said he thought the Court had nothing whatever to do with the legal question, bat they had to consider whether, under the circutmstances in which Sir W. Malway had placed himnself, he had acted as a gentleman, a mnan Of honour~,eanbd an innocent mnan. Was there a gentleman in that assmby who could lay his hand upon his heart and say that he was acting an honourable part in spending money for a particular purpose, and putting it down in a, Prinited balance-sheet to be submittedl to the shareholders as having been applied to a PurPose other than that for uicih it had been expended ? According to the report of the directors of 'the comipany it appeared that sums of mioney which had heen expended as "secret service mloney " had been charged in the balance-sheet as "land comnpensation, law expenses, and engineering.") He -was in favour of the motion of Mr. Blake. Sir W. MAGWAY said it was difficult for him to follow the various speakers, much that they had stated having reference to fOreign communications altogether new to himi; but at the same time he would endeavour to answer, as far as his memorandia would allow him, the points which appeared to bins to hear strongly upon the matter before the Court. He need hardly say that if he did not standl there alnd face them all as en honest man-if he could not account for all his actions, he should not have placedI himself in the sainful position in which. he stood. (ir W. Magnay Wad, lere witch affected.) However painfulandl distressing his situation, was, he had felt that, circumstanced as he was, it was his duty to hold his ground until the whole matter had been investigated, and then to adopt that course which the reut wOuld dictate to him. He denied that he had had a tria, or that 'any fairnes ha been shown t-'vazds the Paltiqa who had been tried at Brussels, and he would undertake to show the Court that the whole proceedings there had been of the maost disgace. ful description, and -such as he never before that day eard any individual say would have justified his appearance in that country. (Ilear, hear.) Ee admitted to the Belgian functionary who visited him in this country that a portion of the sum of 58, 0001. bad been disposed of as "-secret servics money ;" and when that funetiona, quitted him, neither he (Sir W. Magnay) nor Mr. Ashnwel had the least notion that Preceedilngs would have been institut-ed against them by the Belgian Governmnent. MTr. Ashiwell, indeed, asked the .juge when hero whether any difficulty existed with regard to his going to Brussels, and the answver heo received was that he might do so with perfect safety, as there was nothing whatever against him.' Mr. Ashwell, in the Pierfect confidence that he was safe, and having engagements of a very important nature in that country to attend to, proceeded there, and wvithout having received any notice at all that an action had been brOught against him'was seized the moment he crossed the frontier and thrown into prison; anid it was certain from what afterwards appeared that not only had a warrant for his apprehension bieen issued several wveeks before the declaration of the 9'uge that he might pro. ceed there with safety, but that instruction ha ensn to the frontier for his arrest the moment he made his appearance there. Now, after such a declaration as that, after siuch a falsehood, after such a deception, he did not think that any person would charge himn with impropriety in not fohlOwing.Mr. Ashwell to Brussels for the purpose of taking his trial there. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Ashwell, havinc, been apprehended upon warrant, was detained in pri'son' without the opportunity being afforded him of consulting any legal adviser as to the course he should purse. The first charge brought against Mr. Ashwell wras that of bribery. Before that charge was laid before what was called a grand jury in this counitry he had been imprisoned U1 weeks, without even being maade acquainated with the charges that would be preferred against him. He was treated as a convicted prisoner; his solicitor was denied access to him, andI he was subjected only to the forced examinations of the juige and his clerk. The first charge was declared by the grand jury to be untenable. They rejected the bill. Mx. Ashwell was then entitled to his liberty, when a second charge was brought against him-namely, that of robbery. That bill was also ignored. He was then again entitled to his liberty, and he did not receive notice of any charge against him until he was brouight to trial for the minor offence of mirideamenour after the lapse of six weeks from his last acquittaL. It had. been said that witnesses on the part of Mr. Ashwell might have proceeded without fear of arrest. When Mr. Ashwell was inade acquainted with the nature of the charges brought against him he looked around him for witnesses, and was advised by counsel that in the event of his taking them to Brussels they wOuld be arrested as accomplices, and imprisoned and tried with himself. A:ffidavits were confequently drawn UP in this couantry and sent to Brussels with a view to dispense with personal aPPearance - but the 'pineties of the Court before which Mr. swl a tred did nt permit wpritten testimaony to be used as evidence; the consequence of which was that he was tried withOut a single witness being called, or testimonv Of anY kind being adduced ini his favour. He, however, 'was acquitted. After this acquittal, again one would have suipposed that he would hiave beenL set at liberty - but such was not the case. Rle was confined in prison id or 12 days loniger, when he received his discharge and was allowed to leave the country. Any inhabitant of Belgium simnilarly charged would have been admitted to bail. 'Mr. Ashwell offered ball to the amount of 5,0001.-in point of fact, to any amount, but was refused. After Mr. AshweRlls first acquittal he (Sir W. Mdagnay) 'was written to by his freds ho strongly urged him not to trust himself in Brusls sthey had every reason to believe that fresh instructions had been sent to the frontier townis to arrest him, aind he would doubtless then have been subjected tol silnilar treatment to that adooted to r Ahwel LTnder all these circumstances h&el hMsel justfied i wvithholding his appearance from the Belgian Courts. He bad already appealed to the Court of Aldermen to institute ani inquiry into his condluct in connexion with the affairs of the Great Luxembourg Hailway Company, and had stated that by the decision of that tribunal he would be regulated;but lie submitted that the present course of proceedinig was' not the way to try a question affecting a man's character. He was prepared to justify his conduct before any comnpetent tribunal, and was ready to submit to its decision. Ile had been charged wvith having, in conjunction with Mr. Master. man, abstracted 58,0001.- from the funds of the Great Lux. einbourg Ra-ilwaY ComupanY. It had been stated by the Belgian Attorney-General that when questioned upon the sbject they at once admitted that no French party was in existen'ce, and that the money had been lost by a priVate "peclation of their own, A grosser, a more foul, a more libellous. insinuation had never been made. Re held in his hand letters ;fromn the parties to whomt the advances were madle, sh~owing ini the most inotsal manner that the transation -was a ieua ndcproertbl one-whether a judicious one or not heguwas anot groing to say ; but there wasaz aty aost rewspnontbl aondg mochsted,iluntd P&atY-in -insfor whom the shares were purchased, and that Mr. Mastermau was no mAore than the agen in he atter. HeID ~-A~weegvnhm that notParel to Fauve,i t 'wee gvenhin, hatnobony was the transaction a bsaa lide one, but that it was one, under the circumstanes of the case, which was most justifiable, and which 'would have been moat advantageous fOr the companY itself had, It been carried out. Shares of the value of 16,0001 had been expended in the service of the company, which theyhad been the means of saving from utter destretron. ota s-ingle particle of deception had been practised in the matter. The transaction didl not originate with the directors themselves, and when it was concluded explanations were offered to the then shareholders of the .company,-first, at a committee of the principal shareholders, and, secondly, at a general meeting of shareholders, when the whole matter was freely and fairly discussed. it had been said that the directors had no right to put certain expenditure under a different head, They had to do with their shareholders, and if the shareholders were satisfied the directors had nothing more to do than to let them understand that money had been so expended and so accounted for. Sir William Magnay proceeded to read extracts from affldavits and other papers, the effect of which was to show that the conduct of the directors of the company with regard to the expenditure of the 58,0001. had been approved by the shareholders. He also read anumber of letters, for the purpose of showing that a 6osd jide and inf'nential party actually existed in Paris at the time that the directors of the Great Luxembourg Company were mixed up in monetary transactions with the Paris and Strasburg Company. He next referred to original doeuments, for the purpose of proving that various sums composing the 58,0001. had been zrom time to time regularly passed through bankers' hands, and found their way to their destination. The directors had agreed to advance sums of money to the Paris and Stras[hourt Company,for the purpose of gaining advantages which they su p oed would accrue to the Great Luxembourg Company, and ifhe result they had in viewbhad not beeni realized, h(SrW Maaywano osible for their act.Hewsnteemuodn e time that some of h an m that the reference empower those gentee og notemrt fthe ease, be had bcen prfectly ready and wiling to submit his conduct to a Eib%nal which should fairly and fully gB intheotrhatter, nd he aked that Court to afford him a similar opportunity cf explaiing the part he had taken in theaffairs of the Great Luxembourg Railway .Company. (Hear, hear.) He was not draid to meet charges ot any kind that could be brought aanst him; on the contrary he was most anzious for an Investigation into his conduct; i1a'r he could not stand tlero and be charged with having improperly dealt with the money of that company vithout declarimg that charge to be ultterly groundless; and he now declared before God that he hawdnever had a sixpence o' their money. At this stage of the proceedings the discussion was adjourned. Yesterday the Court again met, when the discussion was resumed by MIr. DE JERsRy, who, at the conclusion of a lengthened address, expressed himself strongly in favour of the original motion. Mr. GRESHAM, Mr. Ross, and Mr. JoNxS addressed the Court, urging strongly the necessity of appointing a conimittee to investigate the charges brought against Sir W. Mr. Deputy HAmxrsOw and mr. BEsLEy supported th3 orginal motion. Mr. BxLAYx having replied, the amendment was put, and lost by a large majority. Mr. T. H. FRY then moved, as a further amendment, " Thatitbereferredto a special committee to examine into the nature and truth of the charges broughtagainst Sir William Mag1I, an the Belgian court, on which judgment by defasut has been pro' rouneed, and to reyort to this Court towhat extent those charge, if true, saueet his moral character, and whether in consequence is ha bBcome necessary that he should be called upon to reign bis gown as an alderman of this city."l - Mr. Ross seconded the amendment, which was put and carried. 'Upon a division being called for, there appeared- For the affirmative ... ... ... 39 For the negative ... ... ... 39 Mr. T. PARKm,-I beg to ask whether Sir W.

The LORD MAYOR.-I shall certainly vote for the inquiry. (Loud cheers.) The amendment was consequently carried by the casting vote of the Lord Mayor. The original motion of Mr. Blake was negatived by a ma. jority of If A committee, consisting of Mr. Alderman Cubitt, Sir J. Muegrove, and a commoner selected from each ward, wav then appointed to institute an investigation in accordance with the terms of MIr. Fry's amendment.

THE SUICIDES IN TE PEHRSii EXpErxoUr._ The intelligence which we published on Tuesday, of the self-destruction of General Stalker and Commodore Etheridge,is fully confirmed by a subsequent telegraphic despatob. The temporary insanity during which, according to the verdlicts of tho jurors, each of the melancholy events occurred, is attributed in both cases to excessive anxiety respecting the onerous duties which these officers had to discharge. The effect of this anxiety upon tbe nervous system was in all probability heightened by the influences of so trying a climate. Inthecaseof GereralStalkerthereseemsto bave been some feeling of disappointment with respect to his military position. It will be recollected that the landing of the troops and the taking of Bushire was effected under his orders, and that subsequently General Outram arrived and assumed the supreme co'inmand, a brigade being allotted to General Stalker. It has been represented that this was the original arrangement; but, if a statement which appears elsewhere is correct, the chief command was definitively bestowed by the Bombay Government, and then taken away by the aithorities at home. On this point further information is needed. It does not yet appear whether General Stalker left any statement upon the subject; but he was heard to express disappointment that the command of the 3rd Cavalry had not been given to him. It appears, how. ever, that he was much concerned for the health of the troops during the approaching hot season, and it is obvious that there was reason enough for the greatest anxiety on this subject. The date of these suicides is not given, but they appear to have taken place aboutthe end of March. Shortly after that time of year the heat in the Persian Gulf becomes so gret as to be most dangerous to Europeans;* and some of our readers may recollect that in a letter we published at the commencement of the war, from a writer familiar with the climate, it was asserted that if our troops remained until April they would "die like flies." We hope that, long before this, they have been removed to safer quarters. The people of England will highly honour the memory of a commander whose anxiety for his men contrasted so nobly with the cold indifference manifested in some quarters during the protracted horrors of the Crimean campaign and will deeply regret that two gallant officers should hare thus come to an untimely end, when none of those short. comings for which certain individuals engaged in the Russian war appear so incapable of shame could be imputed to them, but when, on the contrary, nothing but what redounded much to their honour had occurred.-Leeds Murcury. SAvNGs-BANKs.-We may take it as a general rale, in the present condition of legislahon, that any institution which bas half*a-dozen acts of Parliament to regulate and protect it has its affairs in a muddle, and rests upon an insecure foundation. The existing system under which savings-banks are placed is an example of this. We nee i not waste time in debating the poHly of legislative interference with them, for it seems pretty generally conceded that the two opposite goals to which the provident aai needy among the poor classes are led-viz., the savings-bank and the pawnshop-must be exempted from the operatioa of those ordinary rules which allow a man to conduct his affairs according to his own rules of profit or periL To invest or borrow 4,0001. are matters of A B C compare i with similar transactions with respect to 4s. 6d. Therd may be a dozen methods of arranging the former, and a: many persons anxious to compete for the business; but fo - the latter the two establishments which we have mentionei alone are open. The law has, therefore, taken saving - banks under its wing, but it has not done very much for them. It may be, and probably is, popularly believed that Government is responsible for every sixpence that is deposited in these useful institutions, and on a cursory glance at the laws which bear upon the subject this view appears to be a correct one. It is also very generally imagined that there is a remedy against the trustees in case of defalcation; and where those holding that office are known to be honourable and wealthy men great confidence is of course inspired. The Chancellor of the Exche uer, however, in his speech in the House of Com. mons on M onday last, upon reintroaucing his measure of last session with regardto savings-banks, states very plainly that Government is only liable for as much of the funds of the banks as are transferred to it by the trustees. Furthermore, MIr. Sotheron Estcourt-no mean authority in sueh matters-declares that the trustees are withoutany responsibility at all.

I GENTRAL CRIMIJNATZ COUBT, May 1. I TRIAL OF BACON AND HIS WIFE FOR THE I - MURDER OF THEIR CIMDRPhD The proceedings in the above trial were resumed to-day. The prisoners, Thomag FaUller Bacon and Martha Bacon, were placed at the bar at 10 o'clock. The jury, who hat been during the night at the Londoa Coffeehouse in charge of the officers of the Court, were brought in shortly before 10. Lord Chief Justice Campbel and Mr. Justice Cres3weli having taken their seats on the bench the trial proceeded. Mr.Bodkin and Mr.Clark appeared on behalf of the prosecution; Mr. Sleigh and Mr. Lawrence were counsel for Martha Bacon; Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Poland appeared for the male prisoner. The prisoners, as on the previous day, were seated in the dock during the proceedings. They sat a considerablo distance apart from each other, and did not hold the least communication during the whole time. Bacon seemed to exhibit a rather more confident demeanour than on the previous day; but his wife exhibited the same indifferent and careless appearance that has characterized herthroughout the whole proceedings. hlr. SLXion first proceeded to address the jury on behalf of the female prisoner. He said it was a satisfaction to him to feel that he should not consider it necessary to occupy their attention for more than a very few minutes, as he and his learned friend had come to the conclusion that it was quite unnecessary to address them at any great length on her behalf. The first question they had to decide was whether the prisoner had any share in the act of destroying the lives of her children, and he need hardly say that they would not come to a conclusion unfavourable to her upon that point upon any speculation or surmise, bnt upon positive and certain evidence. If they came to the conclusion that it was made out that she had destroyed, or assisted to destroy the lives of her children then another most important question wouald have to be considered by them; which was, whether the prisoner was in such a state of mind as to render her responsible for her acions; and he need hardly saythat,if they thought she was not in a sound state of mind, the'law of England and the laws of civilization and nature required them to say that she was not responsible and ought to be acquitted on that ground. What was the condition of the prisoner as establshed by the evidence for the prosecution ? Why, it had been proved that after being delvored of her last child, she was in such a state of mind as not to know her nearest and dearest relations; that she threatened them with personal violence, and that it was found necessary to remove her to a lunatic asylum, where she remained until shortly before this fatal occurrence took place. What was the conduct of the prisoner when her tvo unhappy children were lying bathed in their blood ? Why she had coolly gone out with her rentbook and a half-sovereign ia her hand to pay her rent, and did not evince the slightest emotion at the dreadful event that had taken place. Cpon these facts, and calling to the recollection of thejury that the medical gentlemen who had been examined as witnesses for the prosecution had distinctly stated it to be their. opinion that the unhappy woman was decidedly of unsoand mind, he said, he thought it would be an idle waste of their time to make any lengthened address to them on her behalf, as he felt assured that supposing they were satisfied it was by her hand the unhappy deceased child met its death-and he was afraid that it would not be possible for them, under the circumstances, to come to any other conclusion-that they would at the samo time have no doubt that at the time the act was committed the prisoner was not in a condition of mind to distingush between right and wrong, and that they would acquit heron that ground. Mr. MLJrcAnLFE then addressed the jury on bebalf of the male prisoner. He said that he could not deny that he felt imprezsed deeply with the responsibility of his position and the fearful issue which depended upon the verdict that would be prononnced by them, but he nevertheless entertained a coofident opinion that when the jury considered the facts of this case they would be of opinion that the evidence was very far indeed from establishing the guilt of the prisoner. The difficulty of his position was very considerably increased by the manner in which the case had been placed before the public by the press; and although he was one of the last who would, desire to see the power of the press curtailed in any manner, and believed that the perfect liberty of the press was one of the most important privileges possessed by this country yet he did complain that the great power possessed by it sbould have been exercised to prejudice the public against the unhappy man at the bar, and that before he was condemned by the jury he should have bees held up to the world as a murderer of the worst description, and every possible eplthet of opprobrium thrown upon him. HIe was happy to be enabled to hear his testimony to the fact that a very different course had been pursued on the present occasion, and to express his thanks to his learned friend, Mr. Bodkin, for the very fair and impartial mauner in which he had conducted the case for the orosecution and he was proud that a gentleman of the Baglsh bar standing in the position of Mr. Bodkin, should feel that he was doing what was right in rendering every fair assistance to the prisoner that was not inconsistent with his duty to the pubNic. He would now ask the jury to consider what the case really was that was sought to be made out against the prisoner? His learned friend had told them in the first instance that it was a difficult case, and if he understood what was the suggestion on the part of the prosecution it was tbat the hushandandwife,who were provedto have been fond of their children, and to have always treated them with the utmost kindness and affection, had, without any assignable motive, concocted a plan to destroy them. Now, was this,to begin with, a reasonable suggestion ? It was admitted that the woman was insane, and the man being aware of that fact was said to have agreed with her to commit this dreadful deed. There did not appear to be any evidence to show at what time the crime was committed, but, if there had been any such plan of murder as had been suggested, surely in that case some steps would have been taken to mislead the police; but nothing of the sort appeared to have been done, and the proceedings that were taken were perfectly absurd. One child was placed in the lower room with its throat cut, and a number of toys on a table before it, and the other was placed in the room utairs * and this was the condition in which they were found; and it appeared to him that there was notasingle circumstanceto support the theory thatthehusbandand wife. concocted this murder. Luckily for the prisoner, one fact, according to hisview of thematter, was quite conclusive of his innocence, and this was that it appeared that onthe day before the murders were committed he had gone to Mrs. Payne, accompanied by his poor insane wife, and requested that she would allow her daughter to be with his wife during his absence, because he thought she was not fit to be trusted alone on account of her previous insanity. The prisoner appeared to have boen most anxious that Mrs. Mttnro should go to his house at an early hour on the following morning, and, if the suggestion on the part of the prosecution was the true one, he could have had no other object than to fix the crime upon himself. If, however, she had gone at the time he wisbed he had no doubt that she would have been the means of preventing this dreadful occurrence and of saving the prisoner from being placed in his present painful position. It was evident that the anxiety of the prisoner was to protect his wife and children *and if he had just before committed the murder, or was just abounnto commit it. was it likely that he should have gone to Mrs. Payne and endeavoured to procure some one to be with his v ife during his absence in the country ? Was it not extremely more probable that, after the prisoner had left his wife, as he said, comfortably in bed, when she found herself alone, this unfortunate delusion came upon her, and insanity prevailed, and she destroyed her unfortunate children? What could possibly tend more to show that this was so than the position in which the unhappy child was found, sitting with its throat cut by a table, and toys before it ? Could it be believed for a moment that if the husband had been concerned in the murderhe would have placed the child in such a position ? He submitted to them that it was clearly an act of insanity, and was one that could not be committed by any sane person. In the course of the trial he had asked a good many questions relating to the appearance ofthe house and to the stains of blood that wre observed. The jury might not, perhaps, have seen the effect of them at the moment, but his objectwas to show tbat every circumstance in the case tended to show conclusively that the act of murder was committed by the poor insane woman at the bar and to negative the presumption that the husband had anything to do with it. They had heard the evidence that there was blood in front of the drawers on which the bookingglass was placed, and it appeared to him that this showed almost conclusively that Mrrs. Bacon had stood before the lookinaglass, and then inflicted the injuries that appeared on herthroat, and that the blood had so fallen from her neck upon the floor. The marks that appeared upon the door were such aswould clearly have been caused by the bloody dress of a woman brushing against it, and he asked them, with great confidence, whether there was any evidence whatever to show that a man or, indeed, anyother person except the female prisoner and her children, were in the house at all at this timae? As to the story told by the prisoner when she was first apprehended, it was clear that was false, and, indeed his learned friend had felt that it was impossible to deny that it was by her hand that the unhappy children met their- death; and he denied that there was a tittle of evidence to show that the male prisoner was at all concernei in the act. His learned fiend who conducted thoprosecution had toldthem that, although the male prisoner might not have been pre. sent when the deed was committed, yet that if they should be of opinion he was aware what was going to be done by his wife, and counselled and sanctioned the proceediig, he would be equally guilty in the eye of the law as an accessory. He was ready to admit that his learned friend was quite right in his statement of the law, but where was the evidence to show that the male 1prisoner had so aoted 2 He should not, perhaps, be justified m asking the jury to stop the case, because the prisoner had told a number of lies, and he ought, perhaps, to give some explanation upon the subject. He should not for a moment attempt to deny that the prisoner had told a great many lies relating to the alleged los of the watch and money and other propeit y - but the jury would not forget that he did not say a of the kind until after Mrs. P ayne had told him that the story told by his nifo could not be credited, as no property had been stolen, and if any smtanger had committed the crime the obectmustthav b een plunder; but the very next day he made the representation to the police inspector about the house having been robbead, and his making this repreeentation was the only reason why the prisoner now stoodat the bar charged with murder.- What, however, was clearly the motive of the prisoner when he lmae these statements t Why, it was eidently his intention to protect his wife, and to support herstatement that a stanger had come in sand committed the dreadful deed, and by so doing he had laid himself open to the present horrible charge. iWas it done to screen himself? Why, at this time no one suspected himn,-the officers were saisfed that he had exhibited the most genuine grief and adfiction at the sad event that had taken place, and there wag not the plighteet suspicion that he had bad anything to do with tha murders. Agood deal ot evideoo had beet gvn in tr eDce tothe manner In which the prisoner was auppoaed to have dealt with -ome wAtches, and for his own put he realy could hardly say what was the effect of that evl dence or what was the object of it; but, EupPoning that the prisoner had endeavoured for somo purpose or other to hide a watch in the cellar, what could that possibly prove in referencetothe present eharge? Itwas evidentthathe was in great distress of mind-he had lost both his children-he was afraidhe should lose his wife also, and under these cir. cumstances he did a number of absurd things to scrten her, and this appeared to havo been the object of all his proceedings. Another circ umstance that appeared to be relied-upon as showing the guilt of the prisoner was the evidence that blood was upon his clothes, and with reference to this he would ask them in the first place whether it was made out to their satisfaction that it reaDy was blood that was upon the prisoner's clothes. But, supposing itwas wbat didit amount to ? It was clear that tht prioner had vwom the trousers upon which the stains of blood were sup. posed to be for several days in the presence of the polic% and if he had thought there had been anything wrong, he asked the jury whether it was likely that he would have so worn them? If they vwere reallystains of blood thatweronpon the tronsrtm it was very easy forthe blood to have come there when the prisoner went into the rooms where the dead bodies were, and in which there were pools of blood in various places. With regard to the confession, as it had been termed, or statement made by the female prisoner in which she alleged that the crime was committed by her husband, he said it was clear that before she made that statement she had been talked to by several women, and that something was said to the effect that she would have to mount the gallows if she did not clear herself, and, being from the condition of her mind liable to be easily deluded, she was in consequence induced to make the statement in question, which on the face of it was utterly untrue, as the manner in which she represented the murders to have been com. mitted was totally opposed to the facts of the case. Some expresdons that were alleged to have been made use of by the prisoner had also been brought forwarrd as evidenceaga inst him; but he felt convinced the jury would not tlink them of the slightest importance when they remembered that some of them were not mentioned until a considerable time after they were alleged to have been made use of, and that the changing of a single word might have entirely altered the effect of such expressions. The learned counsel next referred to the evidence of the conduct of the prisoner at Reigate, aud said it appeared to him that it was the sort of evidence that would ba expected from a lot of old women, and that it really amounted to nothing at all, as the prisoner was an entire stranger to the witnesses, and they kneownothing whatever of his ordinary demeanor. He then called the attention of the jurv to the evidence of what took place at Stamford, and he said fhat what the prisoner did there was with the same object of getting his wife out of trouble and having her restored to him - and he coheluded by stating that he believed he had eterred to all the circumstances that were relied upon as showing the guilt of the prisoner, and had given a satisfactory explanation respecting them. He should leave the casein their hands, with a strong conviction that no jury of Englishmen would find a man guilty of a crime that would consign him to the scaffold unless upon clear and conclusive evidence, and it was for them to say whether there was any such evidence in this case. Lord Chief Justice CArNBErL then proceeded to sum up the case to the jury. He said that a most anxious duty devolved' upon him to sum up the evidence in this most distressing cas. He and they of course could have no object but to arrive at the trath, and ho Was sure that he need not ask them to dismiss from their minds all that they had heard or read In reference to the case, and that they would be guided by the evidence that would be laid before them on oath, and by that alone. The two prisoners at the bar were jointly charged with the crime of murder, and the circumstances of the case were certainly very intricate and required serious consideration; but, with regard to the female prisoner, it appeared to him that they would have very little difficulty in coming to a conclusion. They would of course form their own opinion, but it appeared to him that the evidence was overwhelming to show that she was concerned in taking away the lives of the children; the blood on her clothes, her demeanour when the murders were discovered, and her own statement as to the manner ia which the offencel was committed, were all ci-cumstances which, as it appeared to him, left no doubt that the female prisoner had committed the crime, and if the jury should be of the same opinion the question would then arise, what was the state of her mind at the time ? The learned gentleman who defended the prisoner had frequently made use of the term homicidal monomania,.and he must say that he never heard. that sort of defence set up that it did not cause him alarm. Homicidal monomania meant a desire to destroy, and this was a feeling that the law was bound to repress; and if any person having such a desire took no means to control it, and destroyed life, he would undoubtedly be amenable to the law, if he was aware at the time that what he was doing was contrary to the law of God and man. In the present case, however, this question would not arise, because it appeared to him to be clearly established that the unfortunate womaan at the bar had, by the act of God, been deprived of her reason. It appeared that after her confinement with her last child her mind was affected, that she attempted violence upon her own relations, and it was found necessaryto confino her, and she remained in a hospital for lunatics for several months, and the evidence would tend to show that she was not cured when she was removed, but that she still retained a dangerous propensity for violence, and that her husband con. sequently took the precaution, when he was going into the country to work, to get some one to be with her. All the witnesses, the medical men among them, concurred in opinion that on the Tuesday the prisoner was of unsound mind; and so far as she was concerned, therefore, he thought the jury would entertain no doubt that they should acquit her on the ground of insanity; and she would then be detained until it should please God to restore her nmind. With regard to the other prisoner, Thomas Bacon, the case was very different, aud it would be for the jury to docide whether upon the evidence they Would be justified in say_ ing that he was guilty of the crime of which he was accused He felt it his duty in the first instance to caU the attention of the jury to the extreme improbability that the prisoner should have committed such an act, from tho fact that he was proved to have been tenderly attached to the children whom he was charged with destroying. There were cases, unhappily, where parents through distress, and being unable to provide for their offspring, destroyed them, but nothing of this kind existed in the present case, and there was no such motive for the commission of the crime. The prisoner and his wife appeared to possess all the uecessaries and comforts of life according to their statlon, and the prisoner was earning money, and was at the time engaged on a job, and there did not appear to be any motive for the commission of the offence. The learned gentleman who conducted the case for the prosecution, as he did every one in which be was engaged, in a most exemplary manner, was bound to admit that he could not show any motive or any probability that the prisoner Thomas Bacon committed The act, or that he was even present, and he was obliged to resort to the supposition that the murder had been concocted between the prisoner and his wife, and that he arranged that the murder should be committed by her. What evidence was there of this? Was it likely that the prisoner, who must have been aware of the state of his wife's mind, should have made an arrangement of such a kind with her and have left her to execute it while he went away to his work? It appeared to him that it was most improbable. In many cases circumstantial evidence was most satisfactory and coaclusive, but in the present cae the jury would say whether the circumstances that had been laid I efore them were such as led them to the irresistible conclusionthatthe prisonerwas guilty of the crimeof whichhe was accused, and that they were altogether inconsistent with his innocence. His Lordship then read over all the material portions of the evidence, and concluded by leaving the case in the hands of the jury. The jury retired at 20 minutes past 1 o'clock to consider their verdict, and in about 10 minutes they returned into court and gavo a verdict of N'ot Guity as regarded Thomas Fuller Bacon, and AcqujUed Martha Bacon on the ground of insanity. Lord Chief Justice CAmPBELL, when the jury had de- livered their verdict, said, that he entirely concurred in it, and he then stated that he thought it right to inform them that since the female prisoner had been confined in Newgate she had stated to the ordinary that she alone committed the murder. The prisoners were then charged, upon the second indictment, with the wilful murder of Sarah Anne Bacon. Mr. B6DEni said that, after the decision that had been come to by the jary, he should of oourse offer no evidenco upon the second indictment. The jury consequently returned a verdict of ZNot Guilt,.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, 'Bghal-treet, May 14. IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. (Before Mr. OmmiMe6o HOLROYyn.) Hig Ho,oum. gave judgment in this cass. He said,-Mr.! Linklater, the solicitor for the assigaees, having a few days since intimated to the Court that he had, at least for the present. closed the examinations in the matter of the Royal British Bank, with the exception of some formal depositions and some documentary evidence, I have considered what course it is the daty of the Court to take with reference to the case as it now stands. According to the Act of Parlia. mnent under which this inquiry has been conduoted, the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 111, wo. 2b, areport of theacu of tshe failure of the company is to be made by this Court to the Board of Trade, and the Court is to be at liberty to state any special circmastances relating to the formation or management of the affairs of the company; but by the terms of the Act this report is to be made to the Board of Trade after the company have passed their last examination. Now, the last examination has been adjourned to tho 24th of June; but, nevertheless, notwithstanding the provision in the Act to which I have referred, I think that the Court, in a CaeS calling for its interposition, ought at once, exsc ero motu, to direct copies of any examinations taken under the bankruptcy to be transmitted to Her Majesty's AttorneyGeneral, so that the Government may be advised by the avw ofiicers of the Crown as to instituting criminal proceedings. To wait until the passing of the last examination of the company might tend to occasion inconvenience, if not to defeat the ends of justice. I think this is not a case for farther delay. I do not bolieve that a scene of greater recklessness, fraud, and criminality of conduct in the management of a banking establishment was ever oxhibited in a court of justice than is disclosed by the examinations taken inthiscourtunderthe adjudication of bankruptcyagainst the Royal British Bank; and I may observe that these exa. minations wiUl be admissible in evidence against the parties in case of a prozecution-see " Reg. v. Scott" (1 D and B, Cr. Ca., 47); gReg. v. Haggett" (1 D, Cr. Ca., 656). It -wiU be necessary to a correct anderstanding of the remarks which I am about to make to refer shortly to the Act for the regulation of joint-stock banks in England and to the charter of the company, and to some of the most material provisions in the deed of constitution of the companyviz., the 1st, 2d, 3d, 18th, 33d, 34th, 36th, 44th, 45th, 47th, 60th, 63d, 64th, 65th, and 71st. By the statute 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 113, after providing for the mode and form of petitioning the CrownL for a 'harter or letters patent by a joint-stock banking company for the carrying on the business of bankers in England, it is enacted that the deed of partnership of the company shall be prepared according to a form tolbe approved by the Board of Trade; and shall, in addition to any other provisions to be contained therein, contain certain specific provisions for the following purposes, that is to say :-L. For holding ordinary general meetings of the company once a year, 2- For holding extraordinary general meetings upon a certain requisition, &c. 3. For the management of the affairs of the company, and the election and qualification of directors4. For the retirement of at least one-fourth of the directors yearly, and for preventina' the re-eleotion of the retiring directors for at least 12 calendar months. 6. For preventing the company from purchasing any sh;ares or making advances to any person on the security of as share. 6. For the publication of the assets and liabilities of the company once at least in every calendar month. 7. For the yearly audits of the accounts of the company by two or more auditors chosen at a general meeting of the shareholders, and not being directors at the time. 8. For the yearly communication of the auditors' reports, and of a balance-sheet and profit and loss account to every shareholder. 9. For the appointment of a maniager or other officer to perform the duties of manager, and that the provisions of the deed, with such others as to Her Majes8t shall seem fit, shall be set forth in the letters patent. It Is then provided that it shall not be lawful for any company to commence business until the deed has been duly execated and all the shares subscribed for and at least halt the amount of each share has been paid up, and it shallU not be lawful for the eompany to repay any part of the sum so paid up without leave of the Board of Trade. Next followvs the provision authorizing Her Majesty, by letters patent, to incorporate the company for the parpose of carrying on the banking business. The material articles in the deed of constitution of the company wiiU be found to this effect .-The parties to the deed were to fornm a public joint-stock banking co pany, and the capital of the company was to consist of 100,0001. in 1,000 shares of 1001. each, to be increased if need were. The business of the company was to consist in receiving deposits of money and keeping customers' accounts, aud transacting every kid of usual banking business, and in advancing or lending money on realor personal and other kind of securities enumerated in the deed; and the court of directors might give credit, either with or without security, upon cash accounts to any of the proprietors or to any other person, to such amount, at such rate of interest, and upon such terms as such court should thank proper, agreeably to the bylaws for the regulation of advances; the cash credits to he in the discretion of the directors, but no director was to vote on any motion for an advance or discount to himself; and any part of the capital or funds of tho company not required for the immediate purposes or business thereof was to be invested by tho court of directors in or upon any public or private real or personal securities as the court should think proper; and the company were prohibitedfrom purchasing their own sharesor making advances of money to any person on the security of shares (see articles 1, 2, 3, and 33). Article 18 is to this effeet:-That athe general affairs, business, and concerns of the company shall be umder the management, superintendence, and control of the court of directors, as thereinafter mentiosed; and that they shall have the entire, sole, and exclusive control, management, and disposal of the property and revenues of the company, and shall regulate and determine the mode and terms of carrying on the business thereof; and the court shaU have power to nominate and appointunder such conditions and on such terms as they shall think proper one of their own number, or any other person, to be general manager, for conducting, under their superintendence and control, the basinees and affairs of the company, with such salary as the court shall see fit; and the general manager, if of their own number, shaU ceaso to be a eirctor. Then, by article 36, which provides for the keeping all necessary and proper books of account, the court of directors once at least in every month are to settle and adjust and balance the said books, and make out, declare, and ublish,in such manner as the court shall think pro r, a ft,true, and explicit statement and balance-s et, exhibitng the assets and liabilities of the company, and the armount and nature of the capital and property thereof, and the then fair estimated value thoreof, and the amount of the company's negotiable obligations then in circulation, and the profits and losses of the company, and all other matters and things requisite for fully, truly, and explicitly ; manifesting the actual state and position of the affairs thereof. Article 44 provides for the eeneral yearly meeting of the proprietors in the month of September, and by the next artice (45) the court of directors, if they think it expedient, may hold a second general meeting, to be called a general half-yearly meeting of proprietors; and if a half-yearly meeting be not called the court is to prepare and furnish to every proprietor at the end of each half-year for which no such meeting is called such a printed report of the progress and proceedings of the company and the state of the profits and fund, assets, and liabilities thereof as the court shaUl think proper be made known; and a balance sheet, and profit and loss uccount, and also a report on the accounts by the auditors are, in the month of September in every year to be sent by the post to every proprietor. By article 47 the court of directors at every general meeting of proprietors shall exhibit a true and accurate balance-sheet and report of the profits and accumulations of the joint stock or capital from the commencement of the business, or the end of the ieriod included in the last preceeding report. Then, as to decaaring dividends, articles 60 and 63 are to the foliowing effect:- That at the end of the first six months of every year, and also at the end of every second six months of every year, except as thereinafter mentioned, the court of directors shall determine upon, appoint, and declare such dividend for the period then elapsed, out of the clear profits of the company then actuaUy accrued and reduced into possession, as they should think fit; and if the court of directors shall think proper they are not to make any dividend of the profits dunrig the first year of business, and such profits shal form part of the " surplus or reserved fund," and in each succeeaing year the net profits, after making deduction and allowance for bad and doubtful debts, shall, after setting a&art such proportion of profits as the directors shaU lthink requisite for the surplus fund, be divided among the proprietors; but no proportion of profits is to be set apart for the surplus fund, if by reason thereof the dividend will te reduced below 4 per cent.; and the surplus fund for the time being Is to be added to the capital, and never to be considered part of the profits. By article 64 at every annual general meeting the proprietors are to appoint two or three persons, not being directors, to be aditors for the year ensuing;, for the purpose of examining and auditng the accounts of the directors; and the auditors are to sign such accouAnts_if found tO be correct; but if anv errors or misstatements 'shall_ -appear upo the eainU ation of such accounts the auditors are aiuthorised to cail a sial general meeting of the proprietors, and to report to the meeting the result of the examination, or to lay the same before tho next general meeting; and the auditors, are empowered to require the production of the books, vouchers, writings, and documents relating to the said accounts, and to require the assistance of the general and other managers, accountants, clerks, and officers of the company, or such of them as they shall think proper in the investigation of such accounts. The 65th article provides' for petitioning the Crown for leave to increase the capital of the company by supplemental charter, and that the holders of new shares are to be bound by the terns of the deed, and subject to the same liabilities as the original shareholders, and that one-half of the amount of such shares is to be paid up before issuing the certificate thereof, and that it shall not be lawful for the company to repay the sum so Paid up, or any part tbereof, without the consent of the Board of Trade, And by article 71, if at any time the court of directors shall find that the losses of the company have exhausted all the "strplus or reserved fund," and also one-fourth of the capital actuaUy paid up, they shaU as cooa as possible call a speacal neeting of the proprietors, and submit to such meeting a full statement of the afairs of the company ; and if it shaU appear at such meetingand bo declared by a resolution of the majority of the proprietors present that the losses of he cmpany have exhausted the said fund, and also onefourth of the then paid-up capital, the chairman shall declare the company dissolved, and the same shall be dissolved accordingly, except for the purpose of finaUy closing and widlng.up the affairs of the company. Then, by the harter or Itters patent incorporating the company, it is decl asd that the several regulations contained in the deed of constitution, or in any by law or supplemental di cd to be made in pursuance thereof, shal be the existing reulations of the corporation, and it is thereby doclared that the corporation shall not commence business untit it shall have ben certified to the President of the Board of Trade, byIat three of the directors of the corporation; that all h hav been subscribed for and that the deed of constitution has been executed personxally or by power of attorney by the holders, of al of the shares in the business, and that a sum of not less than one-half of the amount of each share has been paid up in respect of each share as directed by the Aut of 50,00KM. at the leost, being half of the capital of the said corporation, is to be paid tip within 12 calendar months from the date of the charter. Now, nothing can be more clear and explicit than the pro. visions in the charter as to the duties of the directors and other officers of the company, and I may here remark that where a duty is thrown on a body consisting of several per. sons each is individually liable for a breach of duty, as well for acts of commission asofomission,-that is, each individual of the body who does not do what in him lies to discharge his public duty contracts by his negligence individual eutit (see "Rex v. Hollanld," 5, T. B., page 607', and where parties are!required by law to certify as toa particular fact it is not necessary to showv that they knew at the tire that the contents of the certificate were false. In order to sup. port an indictment for conspiraoy to obstruct the course of justice by producing a false certficate, it was beld suffilcient that thepersoncertifyingthe facts as trueagreedto do so without knowing that it was true (see "Rex v. Maubly," 6, T. R., 619). It is not necessary on the present,occasion to go in detail into the facts brought to light during this most painful inquiry, or to single out any particular persons as delinquents; that wiU be for elsewhere and hereafter ; butbhaving regard to the course pursued in the management of the affs of the Rtoyal British Bank, in defiance of the Act of Parliament to regulate joint-stock banks, and of the provisions in the charter, I thinLk that the directors and general managers of the bank are open to some one or more of the following charges :-1st, commencing business before all the shares were subscribed for, and at least half the amount paid up, and repaying parb of the smm paid up without leave Of the Board of Trade, contra"v to the form of the statute (7th and 8th Vict., cap. 113, section 5), and the terms of the charter, page 53. 2d, making, declaring, and publishing false statements and balance-sheets of the assets and liabilities of the bank, and of the amounts and nature of the capital and property and value thereof, and of the profits and losses of the company, thereby concealtng the actual state and position of the affairs of the corporation, and giving a semblanco of solvency where the reality had ceased to exist, and sending false reports and balance-sheets and profit and loss accounts to the proprietors in violation of the articles 36 and 45 of the deed of constitution in the charter, as required by the statute 7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 113, sec. 4. 3d, declaring dividends when no profits had been made, but on the contrary, when the affairs of the corporation were greatly embarrassed and large losses had been incurred, and when, according to the ter-s of the charter, not a single farthing ought to have been allowed for dividend (see articles 60 and t3; and see P. Lord Campbell, in "Barnes v. Pennell," 2 House of Lords Cases, pp. 509 and 524-5). 4th, conspiring to raise the price of the shares of the company by illegsl means and with a criminal view. To give a fictitious price to the shares of a company (which are a vendible commodity in the market) by means of false reports and publications, or by declaring dividends when there are no profits, or by the company buying their own shares is a fraud levelled against the public (see " Rex v. De Beranger," 3 M and S. 6 ; and see P. Lord Cambell in " Barnes v. Pennell," 2 Houee of LordaC ases, 524-5; and see proviso to article 3 in the charter). 5th, conspiring when in astateof insolvenev, and when the losses of the company had exhausted the "surplus or reserve fund" and one-fourth part of the paid-up capital-I say, when in such a state, conspiring to obtain a supplemental charter from the Crown by false representations and by false reports and balance-sheets, and making dividends when not justified in so doing, and thereupon issuing new shares or obtaining deposits for new shares at a premium, with intent to cheat the public and in contempt of the prerogative of the Crown. Gth, maaking such repeated gross misapplications of the funds of the bank by large loans to some of the directors and other persons on terms of the utmost risk, in total dis. regard of the discretion vested in the directors by the charter, with consequent serious loss to the corporation; emnbarking in a hazardous speculation by laying out large sums of the bank money upon an undertaking quite forein to the business of banking-I refer particularly to the Welsh mines-and thereby also incurring heavy losses; not exercsing proper superintendence and control over the general manager in conducting the business and affairs of the company; and though the directors found that the losses of the company had exhausted all the " surplus or reserved fund," and also one-fourth of the capital actually paid Tp, failing to call a special general meeting of the proprietors and to submit to the meeting a statement of the affairs of the company as directed by the 71st article of the deed of constitution, all which ceveral instances of misconduct under the sixth head were in direct violation of the terms of the charter. (See articles 3, 33, 34, and 71.) I may here add that the petition to the Crown for the original charter contained false representations as to the payment of the deposit on shares. With respect to the auditors of the company it appears that they ne, ected the duty which they owed to the proprietors of properly exanmining and auditing the accounts of the court of direotors, for without examination of the books, vouchers, and documents relating to such accounts they signed them as correct, when, in fact, the accounts wxere fallacious, and concealed the real financial state of the bank at the time. The auditors were in a situation to know the falsehood of that which they signed as correct, but negleoted to avail themselves of the means of knowledge within their power. Now comes the question as to the criminal responsibilitv of the directors and other officers of the corporation. Upon this point no doubt can be entertained. It must be remembered that the Royal British Bank was a public company, incorporated by charter or letters patent from the Crown under the provisions of the statute to regulate joint-stock banks in England, for the purpose of carrying on the business of banking,-a business we known to the aw, forming, in fact, a part of the "law Merchant," of which our courts take notice, and in the right conduct of which business, at least by an incorporated publio company with transferable shares, which, subject to the proviions in the deed, might be freely bought and sold in the market, I think it may be said the public have an interest. The management of the businees of such a company is,in truth. a matter of general and public concern. Agan, certain duties are imposed on the company, its directors and other officers, by the Act of Parliament and the charter granted under the Act; and the provisions of the deed of constitution of the company which are specified in the Act, together with such others as to Her Majesty shall seem fit, are required by the Act to be set forth in the letters patent. Well, then it is laid down that a corporation may e indicted for a nonfeasance in not carrying ont the provisions either of their constituting statute or of their charter, or for a misfeasance consisting of an offence at common law, not being treasonable, felonious, or attended with violence, or for an offence against a statute, or against a presoriptive or chartered duty; aud where the corporation may be indicted the individuals who commit the offence may be indicted likewise (see Grant on Corporations, p. 284 - and see " Reg. v. Scott," 3 Q. B., 547; " Reg. v. Great iorth of England Rallway Company," 9 Q.B. 315- "Mayor of Lyme Regis v. Henley,' 2 01. and Fin., 331; and "BXex v Brizac and another," 4 East, 164). If a statlte forbids the doing a thing the doing it wilfully, although without any corrupt motive, is indictable (see "Rex v. Sainsbury," 4 T. R., 457); and if a statute enjoin an act to be done, without pointing out any mode of punishment in case of default, an indictment wiUl lie for disobeying the injunction of the Legislature (" Rex v. Davis," Say., 133). And, lastly, it is clear that an officer may subject himself to a criminal prosecution for breach of a public duty (see " Bryce v. Belcher," 4 0. B., 8G6). I am aware that where a public Act regulates rights which are merely private an indictment wiU not lie for the infringement of those rights. But I consider that an incorporated public banking company is a corporation of a public character, and that the directors of the company are public officers, holding their office under the Queen's letters patent, or derivatively from such authority; and any infringement of the Act of Parliament, or charter founded on the Act, and under which such a company is established, affects the public generally, inasmuch as any of the public may buy shares in the company. The directors, therefore, of such a company ought to be, and I think it will be found that they are, amenable to the law for their conduct as directors, and obnoxious topunishment for not faithfully dischargin their duty. It may, however, perhaps be contended that, althiough the Act to regulate joint-stock banks directs that the deed of the company is to prepared according to a form to be approved by the Board of Trade, and, in addition to any other provisions which may be contained therein, shall contaiu speci a provisions for the purposes specified in the Act, there are no vindicatory enactments with reference to those provisions, and the only prohibitory enactment in the statute is that contained in the 5th section, which provides that it shall not be lawful for the company to commence business until the deed has been duly executed and all the shares subscribed for, and at least half the amount pai up - c .i- Tlil thsma1ail-eaconedfr &c p,s. I thilnk th'is may easily be accountedfor. It might be questionable whether a violation of a provision as to the time of commencing business, though contrary to the terms of tbe charter, would per se be illegal or punishable, unless made so by Act of Parliament. There is no doubt it was a very prudent condition requiring half the amount of the capitat to be paid up befote commencino business ; still it would be difficult to say that the breach of suoh a condition, without showing a corrupt motive, would be indictable, independently of legislative enactment. But with respect to the provisions which the statute requires to be set forth in the letters patent it seems by implication to enjoin a compliance with those provisions, and whether that be so or not Ithink that an infrngement by the directors or any of the other public officers of the corporation, where such infringement did or might operate to the prejudice of such persons as purchased or might wish to purchase shares in the company, would be to the nuisance of the community at large, and therefore indictable at common law. In conclusion, let me observe that while public confidence in the directors and officers of public joint-stock banks is essential to the stability of such establishments, on the other hand One cannot contemplate the mischief, misery, and rau which is produced by the sudden stoppage of a bank, without being sensAble that it is equatly essential that the directors and other public officers should everrememberthat public confidence can only be insured bor prudent manage- ment on their part, and that they should feel that vriminal responsibeity and severe punishment will attach to any nviolation of the Provisions of the charter of tbeir a and that the law is strong enough to reach suhe offences. It has been remarked that if perseverance in wrong often appertains to individuals it mt'ach maore frequently appertains to Pubolic bodies, in which the dsligrace of error or even criminality of conduct belongg t6 so many that no one is ashamed of the patt which belonigs to hiim. self. I think that the mnembers of the gaverning body of the Royal British Batik must have reposed too much on a delusive belief that responsibility becomes infinitesimal by division. For the reasons which I have given I feel it to be a duty incumbent on the Couru to direct that the proceed. iags under the ban'kruptcy bo forthwith brought to the special notice of Her Majesty's Government in the way which I have already pointed out r.LuniR Tml. ir, on the part of the assignees I am aesired to express their deep sense of the obligtion they feel for the very prompt manner in which your lonour hus been pleased to repare your report, andi it is to be hioped that its effect wInsur punishment for those who have entailed so mauch misery to thousands. Mr. FssRs-WDU.-.Sir, on the part of one of the gentlemen whose examination will be forwarded to the Board of Trade (Mr. Stapleton) I may perhaps be allowed to saY two words. I have only had five minutesa notice to attend here to hear your Honour deliver judgment, or I should have communicated with Mr. Stapleton, who wished to make some observations. I havo merely to observe that his examination has been confined to questions that have boen asked him. Hedeaired to give as ful and true answers as poessible, but the answers to the questions do not conveY a correct representation of his conduct as a director in this bank; and that conduct would only have been elicited by others being examined who were in the banklong ante cedent to his connexion with it, oficers of the bank who were in it from its commencement, who had the power of making communication to him; and without their examiunation, as the matter now stands, it does not convey a correct representation of his conduct. He would bave wished personally to explain that and much more, but he is not hero today, and therefore has not the opportunity. The ComSioNER.-I have already said I do not think it my duty to select any one in particular. Mr. FRESHPIELD.-I aw aware of that, Sir; but he would have wished to have been present to add that to his examination. Mr. LiNms&TER.-The less Mr. Stapleton provokes discussion in reference to his conduct the better. Mr. FstEsHpIaiD.-Mr. Stapleton is afraid of no disonssion; and if more had been elicited the more clear would his conduct in the matter have pppeared. Mr. IaNKLATm-He will have an opportunity of saying that hereafter.
I INSOLVBNT DEBTORS' COURT, AMay 14. I - - I1N RE %VILTTAT GIBSON. I (Before Mr. Comrnjsiouer PHaLLIPs.i 'xns case was nleard a few days since, and was reported in T7he Timee. Upon the last occasion Mr. Brtton, the vocalist, complasned that he had been induced by the insolvent to advance 1001. upon the deposit of a lease of a certain house, but that after he had parted with his money he was handed a lease relating to a different house, of much less value than that originally offered. The insolvent denied that there had been anv variation from the original agreement, although he admitted he had the lease of the house which had been mentioned by Mr. Bruton. Mr. Gee, a solicitor, was examined to-day, and stated that he held the lease of the last mentioned honse as security for an advance of 701. Ulltimately the case was adjoued for further evidence.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Thursday, dfay 14. The sittings of the Court for the May General Sessions were resumed this morning at the Gnildhall, Westminster, before Mr. Pashley, Q. C., Assistant-Judge, and a bench of magistrates. There were 110 prisoners for trial, 96 charged with felony and 14 with misdemeanour. The ASSISTAhT-JuDGE briefly charged the Grand Jury. William Hutton, 48, was indicted for having stolen two soles and two mackerel, the property of Thomas Charles, his master. He pleaded guilty. Theprosecutor was a fshmonger, and the prisoner had been some timo in his employment, at good wages. The prosecutor recommended him to mercy, and stated that he was a widower, with two grown-up daughters, one of whom was a cripple, and he possessed a very comfortable home. The AssiSTAN-T-JuDGE said it was a very sad case. The prisoner was sentenced to six months' hard labour. Thomas Vincent Banfield, 17, was indicted for having stolen the sum of 61., the money of Thomas Banfield, his father. He pleaded "Guilty." The prosecutor, a respectable-looking elderly man, stated that the prisoner had been a very bad boy for the last four years, and, having professed a great inclination for a seafaring life, he endeavoured to procure him a ship, and BuCceeded; but the prisoner then Preferred idling his time and spending what money he could get possession of on shore, and he used to go homo occasionally under various pretexts, such as the captain havimg given bim leave, and so on, and told such lies about the ship that he (the father) could not find out where she was lying. On one of these occasions he stole 61., and, having spent it, he gave himself up to the police. The prisoner wanted to get on a man-of-war, and he took hinm down to Portsmouth and tried to get him on board the Victory, but they would not take such boys then, and he put him with a merchant captain, with whom he went a voyage to South Shields, but he would have gone out to Alexandria if he had behaved himself properly. The AssIssvAT-JTPGE said he would take a little time to consider before he passed sentence. Thomas Kelly, 18, and Henry Ray, 17, were indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwellinghouse of Richard Mann and stealing therein some gaspipes, his pro- The evidence proved the case against the prisoners, and they were found Guilty. They were proved to be regular thieves, and both had been previouSly convicted. The COUET sentenced each of them to four years' penal servtude. Charles Alsop, 19, Cornelius Davis, 20, and Michael MuUoy, 20, were indicted for having stolen a quantity of lead pipes fixed to a building, the property of Mary Aun Taylor. TAhey ere found k uil,y, and, previous convictions having been wproved against pulloy and Davis, they piere seotenced to four years' penal servitude each. AlIsop to 1a months' bard labour. (BeJore Mi-. Csssasw.) Alfred Wilkes, 19, was indicted for stealing five coatz, seven waistcoats, three pairs of trousers, three pieces oft cloth, and other articles, value 151., the property of Simon Winkeim and another, his masters. He pleaded "Guilty." Thomas Wilkes, 21, was indicted for having feloniously received p art of the same, knowing it to have been stolen. He pleaded Not Guilty." The prosecutors were tailors in Regent-street, and Mr. Winkem caused some amusement in court by the manner in which hs narrated the discovery of thetheft. Theyounger prisoner had been in their service as porter, but was discharged, and a paper was placed in the window stating that a porter was wanted. The other prisoner presented himself as an applicant for the situation, and being a likely-loolemg young fellow, Mr. Winkeim asked him some questions, and looked him " up and down," as he said, to see what he was made of, when a peculiarity in the design of the waist. coat he was wearing caught his eye, and on furtherinspection he was satisfed that it was one which had been stolen from their stock a short time before. He asked him where he got it from. He repied that he bought a dupl.. cate of a boy in the street, and got it out of pawn; that his own name was Thomas Haines, but he did not know the boy he had the ticket from, and could not identify him even if he were to see him. Not satisfied with this he asked him to step into an inner room, and as he was about to enter he noticed that the trousers he was wearing were also his; and on turning down the upperpart he found the name of the firm written upon the waistband. The name was also under the collar of the waistcoat. Mr. Winkeim was then curious enough to examine the coat he bad on, and he immediately found their name and private mark upon that, As these very articles were missing from the stock, and had not been sold, he gave the prisoner into eustody. On looking him intently in the face Mr. Winkeim thought he detected some resemblance to the discharged porter, and asked him if he did not know ono AlfredWilke_. He said he did not; he had never heardof the name; but the prosecutor told him he did not believe him, and called in a policeman. The prisoner then avowed that he did know Alfred Wilkes, that he was his brother, and that he was the person of whom he purchased the ticket. He voluntarily took Mr. Winkeim and the officer to a place where he and his brother lodged, and on a search being made there duplicates relating to other property which had been stolen from the prosecutors were found, and the brother was then charged with the robbery, which he confessed. At the I a g a savinigs-bank book, in the name of Thomas Wikegs, was found, the amount entered in it beimg 341. Ik was subsequently ascertained that the prisoner Thomas had sold a duplicate of a suit of clothes to a young man in th-i service of a watchmaker, in Regent-street, for 8s., and that suit of clothes proved also to be part of the property stolen by the younger prisoner. The defence set up by Thomas ws that he innocently bought the duplicates of his brother, and did not suspect in the least degree that the articles had been improperly come by. The jury found him GuiRy. Alfred was sentenced to six months' and Thomas to eight months' hard labour. A small sum of money which was foind upon Thomas was ordered to be given no to the prosecutor. Mr. CREASY said he could make no order with respect to the hank-book. No defended cases were taken to-day.

Hannen appeared for the plainti'; and Mr. Francis for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action sought to reer damags for the conversion of about 24 loads of old bricks. It aorred that the plaintiff had purchased soUie old houses at Shoreditch, and employed the defen&Ast, who wAs a carman, to carry the bricks (about 56 loads) from Shoreditch to Stratford, where they were used up in the erection of some new bouses The plaintiff was sued by the defendant in the County Coort for the arag and set up as a defence that the bricks had not all been delivered. The defendant, however, recovered for the amount claimed, and this action was then bronght to recover the value of the hbicks which, it was alleged, the defendant had converted to his own use. The plaintiff said he did not miss any bricks when they were delivered, but having since caused the buildings to bo mneasured, it was found that *a many as 24 cartloads were deficlent. Evidence wva also given to show that a heap of old bricks lying on the land of a Mr. Dodaley on the ne of road had considerably inoreased during the week the defendant was employedin removing the bricks to Stratford, and that the defendanVa cart was on more than-one occasion seen returning to Shoreditch empty without having been to Stratford. ThesUggeStlon was that the plaintiffFs bricks had been stolen and deposited in Dodley's field. Mr. FRANcis, for the defendant, said e shobuld call all the defendant's men, who would distinctly deny tho imnpu tation cast upon them and the defendant; and ho woud also caU Dodayey, who would show that the bricks in his field were his own bricks, and how he became possewed of them. As soon as the first witness ws called, and before he was examined, the plaintiff consented to withdraw all imputation on the defendant's character, and by consent a juror was withdrawn.

Lindsay and Co., ship and insurance brokers, in Austinfriars and they sued the defendant, J. G. Macfarlane, a shlporoker and owner, at Glasgow, to recover the sum of 691. 13s. 3d., due for commission. The only question was, whether the plaintiffs were entitled to charge the defendant commission at the rate of 5L per cent. for obtaining a charter on two of the defendant's ships, named the " William Watson" and the Gertrude," or only at the rate of 2'1 per cent, as the defendant aIlegd The plaintiff, Mr. W.2S. Lindsay, M.P., said that, at tee end of 1855, be had made an arrangement with the defendant to divide the comnission of 51. percent. , but the arrangement was prospective, and had no application to the transactionsinquestion,whichtook placeinDecember. 1854, and January, 1855. It ws also shown that in 1855 the plaintiffs had sent in their accounts, charging the defendant 51. per cent., but he nade no obaection *t he time: and he afterwards, in June. 1855. went through and balanced the accounts at the plaintiffs office, and acknowledged their The defendant was called to prove his case, and stated that the interview with Mr. LImdsay Itook place, not as stated by him, at the end of 1855, but at the end of 1854 or beginning of 1855, while the business was in hand; and that there was a distmnt engagement made to divide the commisson. He said he had never admitted his liability to pay the 5?. per cent., but only that the items in the account were correct, and that it was time enough to object to the debit of 5. per cent. when he was called upon for payment. The defendant also stated that in Scotland shipowners were always shipbrokers, as this enabled them to get half the commission from the English brokers, A correspondence also was put in, which each side contended told in his favour.

Mr. Edwin James, Q,C., and Mr. Hawdkis appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Lush for the defendants. This action was brought torecoverthesum of 491. 12s.6d., being the amount of certain premiums of insurance which the defendants had undertaken to pay on a policy effected on the life of the defendant, J. Beaumont, the younger. Both the defendants had executed a deed to the plaintiff, whereby they acknowledged themselves jointly indebted to him in the sum of 2,0021. 6s. 8d., *ndto secure the debt they had covenanted to insure the life of the younger defendant and to pay the premiums. They subsequently became bankrupt, and the plaintiff proved under the bankruptey for their debt, after deducting the value of the life polcy. The plaintiff having paid the premiums, now sought to recover th.em from the defendants under the covenant. The defendants contended that as the plaintiff had proved for his debt, he was in equity restrained from suing. Mr. Justice WIoHTrLN directed a vedict for the plain. tiff for the amount claimed, but gave the defendants leave to move the Court. HHIEsEY V. EARLE AN'D OTH S. Mr. Grove, Q.C., and Mr. Henderson appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. H. Hil, QC., and Mr. W. Murray for the ~efendants This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover the sum of 187. Is. 4d., being the value of a uantity of hemp sold by him to a ropemaker at Sunderland, named Home, but which, it was alleged, had been improperly taken and sold by the defendants. who were Horne's assignees. The goods had been ordered by Home, and were to be delvered " at Sunderland." As soon as Horne heard that the goods had arrived, finding that he was obliged to stop business, he gave orders to his man to go to the wharf and prevent the delivery of the goods; but before this could be done, one cartload of hemp was brought into the ropery and delivered. Home expressed his displeasLre at this, and sent word by the man not to deliver the remainder; but it was too late, and the goods were delivered, notwithstanding 8orne's wishes and directions. As the weather was snowy the hemp was put under cover, where it was kept forsome days. Hone immediately wrote to theplain. tiff, expressing that the goods were delivered contraryto his wishes and directions; and it appeared that he was advsed by his attorney that, as they had been delivered, ho would not be justified in sending tbe goods back toethe wharf. A few days afterwards he assigned his property and gave up the key of the premises to his assignees, the defendants, and they took possession of the hemp and sold it. On the part of the plaintiff it was contended that as there was no acceptance of the goods by Home, the property did not pass to his assignees, while the latter contended that the contract was completed when the goods were delivered "at Sunderland,$, and that no acceptauce by ,Home was It was arranged that the jury should find averdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, and that the question of law should be argued in the court above, upona nrle to enfterra neosnit or a verdic, the Court having power to draw

Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff; the defendant had no counsel, hut appear-d in person.

On the 26th of December last, bein a holyday, the plaintiff and his friend, a fellow clerk named Beauniont, determined on a pedestrian excuirsion together, and they accordingly walked to Crayford, intending to retnrn by railway from Dartford. On arriving at Crayford at about 6 o'clock they went into the de7end. ant's inn, and called for some refresbment, having partaken of which the plaintiff tendered a new shilling and a new sirpence in payment, and the plaintiff and his friend then left the house. They had proceeded about a mile towards the Dartford station when they were overtaken by the defendant who was accompanied by another man, a blacksmith, biut who was represented to be a constable, when the defendant said to the plaintiff, " You have been passing bad money at my house; you must go back, and, if you don't do so voluntarily, I have a constable ready." The laintiff and his friend were then compelled to return with be defendant to his house. The plaintiff, before going, said, "lWe are gentlemen, and incapable of committing such an offence as you charge us with," and laughed at the defendant, offering him his card of address. The defendant replied, " It is aU very wel mnaking a laugh about it; I know what you are." The plaintiff's friend, Mr. Beaumont, then inquired whether the plaintiff thought they looked like men who went about the country passing bad money? The defendant, making some comment on the moustaches worn by the plaintiff and his friend, replied" Yes; you are just the sort of men to do it." On arriving at the defendant's a policeman wagsentfor. They were asked to change the money, and said they could not, as all they had about them was of the same kind. They were then searched, and a bag containing 18 new shillings, all from the same die, was found upon them. This money they said they had obtained as change from CoutWas bak. The policeman, with the ordinary bias of policemen looking at the ls. 6d. in new money paid to the defendant and at the 18 now shillings found upon them, was satisDed they were all counterfeit, and, on the defendant's charge, took them both to the station-house, surrounded by a mob of boys, who pointed at them as tbieves and " smashers." The sergeant at the station having heard their account of themselvoe, and of the manner in which they became possessed of the new money, had doubts about the co'rectness of the charge, and sent all the money to the house of Mr. Aldridge. in the neighbourhood, wnoiscashier to the Bank of England, with a request that he would examine it and see if it was good. This gentleman returned the money with an intimation that it was all genuine. The plaintiff and his friend were then liberated, but too late to save the train; and had to walk home, finishing their pedestrian adventnre by ariving at their homes at midnight in a sato of mind whichzesulted in each of them bringing an action against the defendant for the Ialase acusation and imprisomnent.

The collector of taxes for the district also peroved that, bythe desire of thillipe, the namneof Ottoyhnad been adaed to that ofPhiDipsin his beoks, and the traveller of a wino-derch nt proved that Phillips had stated that he had taken Ottoy, who was a free vintner, int his house, in order tat he might carry on the wine business in addition to that of a beerhouse, which ho could not otherawse do without a license fro c the magistrates. This witness also added that he had afterwdards made out a numbor of invoices relatingtopror transactions in the joint names on the appiEcation of Philips, hio stated that Ottey had reresente thed necsst wofl suc areseted inore toe avoyids . difficulty"^ with thoeFree Vintaners CPompany.Thesei wivoes had beensgiven to Ottey, who had carried them apay wnthhm Uo n these facts hee plaintiff rested his case, alleoing that the defendant Phillips wtas lable for the acceptance of Ottsy as his partner, MrhJoe s for the defendant Phillips, said that in all his experience of bil transactions he had nover met with so gross a fraud as would be presented to the jury by his witnesses inauswr tothe wok ptiff` fcie case of the pantiff. Who he was he did not know; but, as ho understood he was in court, perhaps the july woald see him, and learn something of his eonnexion with this lreat house of Freewin and Co., and of the manner in which he had become possessed of these biDs In whatlver manner, howfver, thow n had cometo the plaintiff's hands, thedrefendant, Mr. Phillips, entirely domed al liability aud knowledge of them, and it woaldbe for the jury to say whether they were not concocted by Ottey, with certain other parties in connexion vwith one Seresby, who was the only member of the firm of Frewin and Co. whom their agent Captain Lungridge had professed any personal knowvledge of, but who was not nowr in court to gnve his own history and that of these bills. As for the unfortunate connexion of Mr. Philips with the other defendant, it was this,-Mr. Phillips was a respectable, honest, hardworking publican, who, being anxious to add the wine business to,tant ofseDingbeer,wasinformedbyoneChambers that he might do so without a license if he could secure the name and services of a member of the Vintner's Company and with this view that worthy introduced Mr. Ottey to him. The defendant then engaged Ottey, and gave him nper week for te use of his name, and 16s. mere for his sercsas a barman. In order to carry out this arrangement the name of Ottey was added to that of Phillips as spoken to by the plainWtfs witnesses; bt there never was any partnership, end tha wehol matter was fully osplained to the traveller, so thatthere could not bo said to have been anyholding out of Ottey as a partner. So matters went on till one snight Mr. Phillips was served by a lawyer's clerk with a writ in this action, that being the first time he had ever heard of these bhis, or of the plaintiff, or of the draner, who wuas, by-the-by, a tated to be now at Boston UnitedStt busa very convenient place for such an indendual, nO donbt. ur. Phillips caled ine httey hd o professed that the whole affair wras a mystery to him also, and they both went off to see the attorney of the plaintiff. He was out, howveovr, and an appointment was made for the next day, but after that MIr. Ottey never came near the defendant Phillips, and up to this time he had no notion where this supposed partner was, for whose acceptances he was now sought to be made liable. As for the plaintiff, he realy did not know who he was; but as for Seresby and his companions, thoy must have risen to wealth and respectability verysuddenly, for he would show that a very short time back Seresby and one of them were sued for a debt of 301., incurred on tho purchase of the stock of a paltry tobacco-shop, and could nowhere be found, though andetective offic~er had been set to work to discover them. In support of this statement several witnesses wre examined, and amon them Mr. Philips, who denied all kniowledge of the b ; when. The ury evinced a desire to stop the case in his favour. The learned C'ouNsEr for the plainti£ however, in3sisted on proceeding, and called Mr. Dales, who stated that he was a large builder and contractor; that he had built the Wellington Barracks, and was now building the Kensington Barracks; and-.that he hadbtaken the bills from Frewin and Co.,-or, rather, from Seresb y as representmg that firm-without inquirv and on the faith of their respectability, and that the consideration was a debt of 1,200. ow'm to him, which had been recently reduoed to about goof Captain Longridgeowas also recalled, and he stated that Frewm and Co. was a veracious firm; that Frewin lived in Oxford, though he had never seen him, as we understood, but that Seresby he knew very weD and had seen this morning at the -place of business in Finsbury, and who he believed was now at the Docks. The solicitor to the plaintiff was also calledat the sugges tion of the Chief Baron, and he stated that the parties connected with the bill were known to him professionally; that he had beenengagedi for Seresby and another in the action for the purchase of the hop, but did not know whether they had -paid the money; and also for Seresby, who had been sued on hisI O U for 10. in the Lorl WMayor's Court. this rty having been givn by him on his bori that sum w.hen speulating in Turkish stock (Laughter.w MIr.

It wtoeared from the evidence given on the part of the plainti that the deceaed, Mr. Griffiths, hd lodged for many yearswith theplaintiff'slather, ad bad become mauch attlchecl tothe children. Afewdays before his deth, whilo lying on his death-bed, he caled the father to his bedsid, and tolda him to tke out the.money which wa inhistrowses-pocket, andtogiveittohisdaugter Jen, saying atthe m time that v'en he got betterJhe would make it equal to what he had left her brother. .He had made aproviion for the brother to the amount of 500L TLwo or three days aften the ister oE Mr. Griffiths, who hadnever visteolhim before, came to see him, andgSott, the father, banded over to her the 15?2. he had taken from the trowserspocket of the deceased, telling her that hee brother had desired that it sholda be given to the plainti9; Mum Griffiths took the money, and a demand being =de for it after the death of 31r. Griffiths, it was refued, aad this action was brought for its recovery. The most mateial facts of the ease were stated by Mr. John Scott, who was examined by Mr. JAxes. He said,-I na the fath rof: the plaintiff. I have known Mr. Grifrithz about 12 years; he boarded and lodged at my house. Ho was very fond of my children. In1853 he met with an accident and broke one of his ribs, and after that he took his meals with us. None of his relatives ever visiLd him. He often went down to the place where IL sister, Miim Grilffliths, lived. One Suda eveniuag, abot a week before be dlied, he in. quired"Where is Jennty?* Mrs. Scott told him shei gone to bed. He then asked, "Where is Mr. Scott?' I was thensitting at the foot of the bed. He then taid, "What money there is in my trowsers pocket take for JTenny." His trowwr wre under his pillow, and he raied himself up for me to take them. There wu m the trowmers' pocket 152. 2s 7d. One sovereign he ordered to be given to my daughter for her immedihte use, and one eoverei was to meet sme expenses -which had been incurred an Es account. Next day a comudn of his, Mr. Rutter, came to see him, and I told him what had occurred, and offered to hand the money over to him, but he rfused to take it, and said I had better hand it over to Miss Griffita, Mr. Griffithe' sister. She came to see her brother next day, and I told her of it, and I also told her that her brother owed me for three years and a-hf hoard and lodnng. Ihanded the money over to Mis Grifiths about two days before her brother died. Cross-examined by Mr. OVnENaD.-Mr, Griffiths was an old bachelor of 70 years of age. He used to walk about the streets agood deal, having no oocupation. He used to lend me money. I paid it back beforo 'be died. He bad pre. viously made provision for my ion in his vill to the amount of SOl, and in a eodicilmado on his deathbed he gave 1961. to my wife. The eonversation about my danhter took plaoethe:Sundaybeforehedied Itwasintheevening and my wife and he were taling about "burying." She asked him where he would like to be buried. (Iaughter.) Ken. sal-green she said was a nice plae. He said thtitw w, but that Highbgate was a nioe place too. Before the oonclusion of the plaintiff's case a consults. tion took place between the lIned counsel on either side, which ended in an Nreement that a juror should be -withdrawn; that the legaces mentioned in the will should be paid; and that another action pending between the same parties should not be brought to trial. The learned JTuGI expressed his approvalof this arrangement.

POLICE. GuIn AILu-Jamea Neal, an elderly man, was charged with burglariously brealing into the premises of Mr Townaend, wholesle hosier, of.No. 1, Cripplegat-buildings, Fore-stret. MIr. Charles Harding said,-I am as schoolmaster, and oCCupy the upper part of the premises at No. l, Cripple. gate- lildings. I eft home yesterday with my son ibout 12 o'clock, andwas returning about half-past 10 o'clock at night, when I saw two men come from my door, and, feeling satisfied they had no businea there, as every one with the exception ox my own family had left, I asked them what they wanted there, upon which they both hurried away. I approached the prisoner for the purpose of detaining him, whenheturnedroundanddashed the dark lantern produced in my face. It struck me on the mouth, and caused me grt pun at they were desperate characters and had been doing some unlawful act, I followed them to the end of Philip-lane, where they aea rated, and I thenpursued the prisoner until he was captured in Three Tun-oourt. Inam sure he is the man who threw the lantern in my face, for I was not more than two yards from him from the time I firt saw him till his apprehension. After charging the prisoner at the station I returned home and examined the premises, when I found that Mr. Townsend's warehouse door had been broken open. I found inside the warehouse door a piece of wood which had evidently been used as a purchase wedge, and at the head of the cellar shirs four empty bags. On returning from the examination of the warehouse Ifound the small crowbar or "jemm" produced behind the street door. Mr. Townsend's warehouse is separated from the part of the house I occupy, and it is locked up safel every night. Charles fardinc, jun., corroborated all that his father stated, and the prisoner was then remaaded. Samuel Sleep, the driver of a cab, No. 2,260, was summoned for unlawftully demanding and tSaing more than his fare. Mr. Charles Pearson, the City Solicitor, having been sworn, said,-I hired the defendant's cab on the 6th of the present month at the Waterloo Railway Station. He took meupat 25 minutes past 8 in the morning, and, after driving me to Grafton-street, Piccadilly, Park.street, West. minster, and Lincoln's-inn-fields, he put me down at Guildhall at 20 mnmutes past 12 o'clock, occupying in all about four hours, of which about 80 minutes were taken unin travelling the distance and delays through the obstruction of the thoroughfare. He demanded lls, which I paid him, and gave m a summons at the saMe time. Alderman THTAm-What have you to say in answer to this complaint? Defendaut.-I waited at Graftonstreet 32 minutes, and at Park-street 2 hours and 20 minutes. Mr. PearsoL-Then we do not disagree upon the facts. Defendant.-I waited three hours ad three-quarers, and the rest of the time was occupied in going the distance, which I think is over six miles. ir. Pearson.-How can that be possible, for it leaves only 10 minutes to do seven miles in ? Defendant.-I could not do that distance in 10 minutes, certainly; but I was under the improssion that I ws occupied m all about five hours. Mr. Martin, the chief clerk.-The defendant is wrong in his demand, both as regards time and distance. Mr. Pearson.-He was about 80 minutes doing the distance, and he was foolish to demand so much when be bad such a good fare. Defendant.-But you never objected to it, Sir. If you had I would have taken less. If you had given me half a sovereign I should have been satisfied. Alderman HALs-Thatis just what Mr. Person complans of. You had no right to demand more than your fare, forthereare many gentlemeu would pay it rather than haveadispute. You have given r. Pearson a del of trouble by your conduct, and Itherefore fine you106., and order yenta return the amount of overcharge. The defendant paid the fine, hich, with the costs and overcharge, amounted to 1&s. Bow-snmur.-An important quesUon, affecting tse recently conceded privilege of drirvng through St. Jsaess Park, arose out of one of the night charges heard before Mr. J&nnDLz. The defendant, Mr. Felix O'Hamlin, a commercial traveller residing at Pimlico, appeared on bail to answer the charge of having caused an obstruction at the Marlborough. gate entranco to the park by attempting to pasn throug with an improper vehicle. It appeared that about 6 o'clock in the evening the defendant rove up to the gate in a dogert, intending to pM from Palace-yard to Buckinghanm-gate, A. cousable on duty (A 621) and one of the park-keepers (Ford) interfered to prevent him, tel:ing hima that, according to the zew regulations, none but pvatecarriaes and cabs wer allowed to go through. The defendant said he had a right to pa and had frequently exercised that right without moletaUtion. A mob gathiered very speiy, and severa carriages were obtructmed by the dee t who pserd in remainng there. Eventally the cobleethdefendant's horse back, and begged of him to go ay, but he returned to the gate, insisting en his right b enter,; offered to give the oonsable a ride throuhh the prk if le would jump up at the back. Fin t a pe un avaling, the offioer took the defendant into etedy,an t his horse and vehicle to the gresnyad. Mr. JA=Dm-n inquired if defedaut was sober? The Constable. believe he wanot.

THE GROWTH OF COTTON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,--My attention has been drawn to this subject by the report in your journal of the meeting of the Society of Arts, held yesterday, and the paper then read by Mr. J. B. Smith, MY. In a letter you did me the honour to insert last month on the subject of " Morocco" I there stated, but cursorily only, that the cotton plant was indigenous to that connt, y; but as this subject is now becoming one of national importance, and there appeer many diiliculties in the way of procuring a sufficient supply of cotton for our consumption, and new fields adapted for its cultivation and easy of access are being sought tor, I beg to lay before your readers interested in the subject the few following observations. Tho cotton plant grows wild, in great abundance, in North Africa (only a few days' sal from England), which has been pronounced by competent judges to be of a superior quality - it is of a silky texture, and easily separated from the seed by mere manual labour, and vast quantities might be obtained from that country if its growth was encouraged. The points for consideration that necessarily arise are as to the quantity of cotton that could be grown and the facilities for cultivating it. Thereare extensive districts of rich land, totaUy uncultivated (free, under the terms of the late treaty, concluded by Mr. Hay, from any imDpost, for agricultural purposes), the fertility of which may be esti-nated from the fact of twvo crops being generally produced in the same year off the cultivated parts adjoining. Labour is to he procured in abr'ndance and at a cheap rate, and the -natives are a class of men who work well, being anxious to earn money to enable themi to acquire their own cattle and corow their ow n crops, and at the same time, consequently, -nnprovc their social position, and they would readiUy cultivate the cotton planb, if they knew they shoald find a market for it. There is an ample supply of moisture all the year round, independent of irrigation, -which could be cheaply effected, as the natives in some places carry the water for nearly half a mile through cork troughs for their corn crops. Although the system of agriculture adopted by the MIcors is of a very primitive character, it is amply sufficient to produce good crops, owing to the natural facilities that exist in the richness of the soil and a genial climate. They also have their men of talent as agriculturists in their small way, some being considered clever at sowing broadcast, others at ploughing, ;c. The Mloor simply sOews his seed and then leaves it to nature to become mature; neither is he disappointed, for never is mnanure, and but rarely irrigation, required. It appears evident, from the statements made at the meeting by gentlemen possessing local knowledge, that great alterations must necessarily be effected and existing difficulties overcome,-the work, indeed, of years,---before cotton could he produced in India sufflci. ntly cheap and in any quantity. T£he various difficulties commented on by hM-. Smith in his able paper, and those referred to by other geotlelnen present, are, in point of fact, the actual facilities presented by INorth Africa-viz,, rich laud, a favourable tenure, proximity to the coast, and most favourable climate, in addition to which labour iB both plentiful and cheap. I fear that as great difficulties exist as yel as regards Western Africa-viz., thediatance inland, wfant of roads, hostile tribes of natives, and uubealthy climate. 'Trnating that these fewF remarks may not ba-unaceptable, ~ Iam Sir, your obedient aervauL F. BOWDEN. I", xNew LnSWou.COfrt, Lwcon's-inn, May 14.

MUUBDEP BY AMANRAC. WOKINGH&IKf TnURSDAY. A man named John Blackwell, about 25, a shSemnaker, residing with his grandfather, in Rose stre.t% in this tow,. has committed a murder, under the influence of mental delusion upon religious matters. It appears that during the war in the Crlmea Bla'kwell enrolled himself in the Berkshire militia, v,lulnteered for foreign service, and went out with the regiment to Corfu, where he remained until after the termination of the war The regiment was recalled, and he returned to England, from wbich time he has resided in W1;kingham, and obtained subsistenoe by ocossionally working at his trade. He has been of a strongly religions turn of nind, snd has diligently applied himself to the study of Sariptare. It became apparent that his mind was gradually giving way, and ao mar'ted of late had been the change in his conduct that it-was feared. he would-either lay -violent hands. upor bimself or doinjo7to persons near wbom he was reiding. Tno p h aithoriticg had be made -tcquainted with the fact of theeisentilterangsenetf Blackell, and; though they had not placed him under restraint, they caused him to be watche, untit the necessary forms had been gone thro=gh to obtain an order from the magistrates for his removal as a pauper lunatic to the asyluL at Littlemore, near Osxford. In consequence of his being in such a disordered stato of mind it was arranged that thomas'Rance should sleep With Blacka-el on ~a inesday nii ht, and he arrived at the houseofBlazkwells grandatberabout 10 o'clock. There were two men, named Mllfs and White, in the house at the Iime, and when Rance entered the door Blackwell asked him, if he was come to sleep with him, and he answered. *Yes, I am." As White lived in the house on one side of old Blackwell's cottage, and Mills on the other, Rance told them on the:r leaving that if anything happaned in ihe night he would knock loudly against the waU. Soon after midnight MBils and his wife, owcupying the adjoining cottage, were aroused by a loud noise as of some one calling. He hastened down slairs, and looked out of doors, but could not ascertain whence the roise came. In a little time he heard a Lteffling noise round the corner o' the next house, by Blackwell's backdoor, and on hastening thither he saw Blackwell standing over Raee, -who was lying on the bricks, quite dead, and he said "There, I've nturacred my conqueror." Bo3h Blackwell and Rance wore onlv a shirt, |and were besmeared with blood The wild and lerocions manner of Blackwell so much alarmed MGIls that he ran hack into his house and fastened the door, for fear of mischief laiD" done him by the maniac. He had scarcely made his doorse'ure wvhen BlackweUfarrived, and asked tobe letin, calling Out loudly. ' ve killed the Devil ; T'm the King of Kings" Blackwcll after a time walLed away, and Mills, having dressed himself, went out of doors, and with a man named Patey proceeded to the back of Blackwoell's house. A man named Frankam had been attracted to the spot in the meantime by the noise, and saw Blackwell in his shirt, with something round his neck. Blackwell, when he saw Francum, exclaimed, "I am the conqueror-I have killed the Devil, and there he lies bleeding in his gore; now I shall go to glory." Frankam then put his hand on Blackwell's shoulder and said, " Wlo bave you been serving so-' and the answer he gave was, "The Devil, the Devil i" Blackwell then walked away, having only his shirt on, and returned after a long absence. He came and knelt down fin ront of the house, and began praying in a very incoherent rmnner. The body of the unfortunate man IRance was removed, and near where it was found was picked up a large knife, with which the deed had been perpetrated. Two police-officers were made acquainted, with the fact a little before 1 o'clock this morning, but wben thev went to the house they could not find BlackwelL Th,y made a minute examination of the place, and it appeared tha' Blackwell aud his unforDunate keeper slept together in the zoom on the ground-floor facing the street; here it was evident the struggle commenced, for spots of blood were found on the bed and on the floor leading to the back kitchen, the door of whichRancesucceededin opening,when he rxceived a blow which struck him to the ground and rendered him pwerless. Immediately afterwards Blackwell settled the fe of his victim by making a wound across the nieck about two incbes long, and passing through the superficial and deep muscles to the spine of the vertebrm. He appeared to have died without further struggle. The polce officers continued to wait in the house, and a little before 3 'clock, a noise being heard in the Btreet, they went out and found Blackwell kneeling on the ground and praying. He was then secured, and after he was dressed he was removed to the police station by Superintendent Bostock, of the Berks constabulary. When he was told the natare of the charge ho said, *' I could kill you aU, but I have done enougb." He was removed to a cell, and when visited an hour or more afterwards by the superintendent, be said, "Sir, rm no murderer. God has told me gaciously, in answer to prayer, that when I struck Rance I was not conscious at the time." At a later psrt of the day the prisoner Blackwell was 1aken before Mr. D£ley. the chief magistrate of the town, and underwent an examination. Four persons were ex- nsm;ued, and their evidence was a confirmation of the facts above related. At the conclusion of the examination of witnesses Blackwell, who appeared very wild and excited, said, " I am charged with wilful murder. I thank ay Lord the Ring of igs and founder of the world, whom I have served, that Hfe has freed my conscience from any guilt. He (meaning Rance) volunteered to sleep with me a me to sleep on. When I bad certain evidences inmy mind that etermt.y was ColiDg' what, thought I, ileep on I I got out of bed once oi twice. and he pulled me in. He said, ' Don't you feel warm ? I said, 'I don't feel everlastingly warm.' I got out of bed, and could scarcely forbear striking him. I said, ' You Devil.' I had had that presentiment on my mind that he was a Dev l on earth. I thought he was lying in the presence of the ' Prince of Peace and the Son of Righteousnese' -that isin Jeremiah. Well, I struck him a blow which almost levelled him to the ground, and the second did quite. I then got a knife and ran after him, and caught him just as he got open the back door, and I then struck him in the neck. The knife did not cut, and I managedto hag and jag away at it until I done the job." The prisoner was then committed for trial at the assizeg.
bOcIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THE GoSPEL -Yesterday afternoon the annual general meetinzi of the St. Jamess branch of this society was held at Willissrooms, King-street, St. James's. His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury presided, and there were also present the Bishops of London, Durham, Oxford, Chichester, Carliale, Llandaff, Bath and WeDs, Hereford, St. Asapb, Salisbury, Lichfield,Kentucky,Victoria,Antigua, Jamaica, andRupert's Land, the Earl or Carnarvon, Rev. Lord J. Thynne, the Rev. M. Caldwell, of Madras, theVery Rev.Dean Newman, of Cape Town, the Deans of Westminster and Canterbury, Canon Wordsworth, the Master of the Temple, Mr. Justice Coleridge, and many of the chief metropolitan clergy. The proceedings having been opened with prayer the most rev. Chairman briefly addressed the meeting, urging npon its Ferious consideration the eternal importance of the great labour in which the Eociety was engaged, aud called upon all to take their part in the 3^issionary work which was spreading the name and gospel of the Lord through(ut the land. The Earl of Carnarvon moved the first resolution, which besought the church at large for new and increased efforts, to sustain the missionary operations of the society, and enable it to meet an annual loss of 10,0001.. which the discontinuance of the collection under the Queen's letters had occasioned to it. The Bishop of London seconded the resolution, and said he quite agreed with the expectations of thenoble lord that no great evil would arise to the efficiency of the society by the withdrawal of the sum gained from the Queen's letters. It but required tbat the society should throw itself openly end withoat reserve upon the good feelings of the members of the chureh of England-unfold the great field of its labours be.ore them-and they would gain a far larger sum in voluntary aid than they had ever gamned from the instructions of a Royal letter. \*t them look to the general mass of the church of Endland-the people ia whose hearts he was sure the church was daily taking a deeper root, and in them the society would find its strength to carry out and extend still further its missionary operations through the heathen dependencies of Great Britain. The resolution having been carried ,cm. com, the Bishop of Oxford proposed tbe second, pledging the meeting to support and further the efforts for the spre? i of the gospel in India and the E-sb, where a large and immediate increase in the number of missionary labourers was sorely needed. The right rev. prelate spoke at some length, and with great eloquence and power, urging the responsibilities of our position as governors of India, where we had a population of upvards of 184,000,000 under the government of the Crown, with an additionsl lO,000,000under its protection, asit was termned. Itwashigh timo that something 'was done with these souls. In 1814 the see of Calcutta was founded; but what a see was it? A. see larger than the whole of the united kingdom, with a population of 136,000,000 intrusted to the overlerloo=ing of one man, who, having a conscience, called loudly for assistance and a subdivision of his diocess. -Situated as he was now he was the bishop of a diocess, half of which he could never see, of a clergy he could not .dvis$, of a flockto wlhom he could pot preacb. To speak'of that is the iee of Cicuttawasatojpigs olfa fraud upon the pious seasibllities of the English people. Let them have more bishops in India, bishops in the north as wel as the south, and he was glad and happy to beHeve that in a brief time Agra would be formed into a see, with a bishop of its own. Once they got bishops they would soon get clergy, and with clergy came aU the means of grace which so many of the natives wished for, and under the shadows of which they longed to sit in quiet. The Rev. R Caldwell, of Madras, seconded the reso!ation, bearing high testimony to the happy results of the society's labours in the East. Ho instanced Tinuevelly, in which province Christian congregations had been established in no lesa than 627 villages, and 42,000 men, women, and children converted, of whom 4,900 were communicants, and 10 Eindoos bad also been admitted by ordination to the ministry. This happy result-much of which was due to the efforts of the Church Missionary Society-was, however, by no means a solitary instance of tho spread of the gospel in the East. The resolution was carried unanimously. Other speakers also addressed the meeting in support of its objects, and the proceedings terminated with theusualformalities, and acordial vote of thanks to the most re r. chairsman, which was carried by acclamation. A collection in aid of the funds of the society was made at the doors, which appeared to be liberally responded to.

MWRDzR AND SUICIDE A2 BRADXT?RD. A dreidful tragedy ha occiorred at'Bradford, Yorkahllro. Hannah Holroyd, a vidow, 42 year Of age, was zurderd at ;iMdnight on Monday, and immediatel, after the perk*tr&. tion of -he awful crime Samuel Charlton, the nluraerer, cominitted suicide by drowning. The rash acts are the result of jealousy. Cbarlton was an assistant-bailiff and A, dealer in waste, aged 58, sad resided at Lidget-green, a 6uburb of the borough, about two miles from the oentre of tbe oa Howas a widower witiefour chiLdren; hi victim had a family of five in number, and supported them by keeping a small ghop opuosite Charlton's regidence. For anMe length of time pat shLrIton had. paid his addreses to 1l1lroyd, but as he bore A very indifferent character her friendx disiaded her from the matcb, aud latterly she seenms tohave favoured the advances ofa yo uger man, Luke Nornmington, Charlton's rival. Becently Charlton, who had been a man of unsteady babits, professedhimself a teetotaller, etnd on'honday eveninghe weuttoateinperauce meeting at .whfcb Jlolroyd was present. At itg termina.tion Holroyd called at- a nefghboeo's houge - on her- wAr hone, whUe Chrlton walked on and awaited her arrival, which took place at half-past 11 o'clock. In the meanwhile her daughter Martha, tired of sitting up so late, went out to ascertain if she was ready to return home, and thea saw Luke Normington in conversation with ber. The girl left Charlton, and her mother sat at the fireside as usual and retired to rest She awoke Fbortly before I o'clock, heard the outer door closed, and recognized Charlton's step as he left the house She went down to lock the door, and discovered her unfortunate parent with her throat dreadfutly cnt; in fact, the head was almost severed from her body and lying in a quantity of blood. The door was locked on the outside. The police were attracted to the spot Sy the girrs shrieks, and on visiting Charlton's house learnt that he had left after bida;ng his children a last farewell. A razor, stained with blood, was found in the coal. cellar. A search was instituted for the murderer, and at 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning his body was found in the New Mitler's Dam, a large reservoir a mile distat from the scene of the murder. Mr. G. Dyson, the district coroner, opened an inquest on the body of Hannah Holroyd on Wednesday afternoon, at the Second West York Yeomanry Inn. Lidget-green. Martha Eolroyd, daughter of the decemsed, said,-I am 19 years of age. My father, Joshua Holroyd, died five years ago. He was a quarryman. There are five of us in family. Samuel Charlton had kept my mother company about a year. et had no trade, but was a sort of bailiff. I do. not know wbether he was going to marry my mother. He has beeninthehabit of coming to sit inthe house. They ad quarrelled for some weeks past - she had desired him tq stop away, but he said be would stil come, for if he did not have her nobody else should. He has never, in my hearingv threatened to do her any mischief. About half-past 7 o'clock on Monday evenin my mother went to the teetotal meeting. She.returned about half-pat ll o'clock, having called at a neighbour's house op"osite on her way home. Charlton came in direct.from the reeting long before her, I should think quite an hour previously to her arrival. He did not speak;he appeared quite sober. When myaothercame in she sat down at the fireside, and I went to bed. When I left my mother satin front of tbe fire,. and Charlton sat on a stool at the fireside, My mother appeared as chrerful as usual. It would be about 20 minutes to 12 when I went to sleep. I had heard no quarrelling whatever then; indeed, I ha not heard them speak at all. When I awoke, at about a-quarter to 1 obclock,1 saw the light was burning downstairs, and when I listened I heard Charlton come to the door and look in. He went away directly; I heard him shut the door behindhim. In three minutes I thought I would go down and sce if he had left my mother aseep, and, if so. lock the door. I found the door loceled on the outside. I saw my mother laid on the floor, with her feet towards the fireplace, and her head in. the midst of a great deal of blood. I made an alarmn, and people came in directly. The key was on the outside of the door. Abr&ham Pearson, Henry Jowett, the constable, and Binns, the policeman, came in. LuLke lN.=ormington had kept company with my mother when he could. She rather leaned to Luke Normington, and he caught hold of her when she left the neighbour's house to come home. I went out to see if she wascodminghome thaLt Imight go to bed, and saw Normieg. By theJury.-When I went downsthirs my mother was very nearly undressed. Normington has been in our house two or three times, Police-constable Biuns, of the Horton division of the Bradford police force, said,-At a quarter to 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning last I was on duty at Lidget-green, hiDd heard a scream of "emurder." I went to Holod' house, anclnd found the door locked on the out- ce. s I turned the key, went into the house, and saw Mrs. Folroyd's daughter, who was screaming dreadfully. On tlGe foor was the body of the woman, quite dead, and weltering in blood which proceeded from a gash in the throat. I lifted her up and saw that her throat had been dreadfully cut. I askedI the daughter who bad last been in the homue with her mother. She said she left Samuel Charlton and hermother sitting together atthe fireside. The deceased woman was partly dre3sed. I went to Charltonrs house, and his daughter told me that her father had been in the houEe a short tine previously and bid them goodbye, as he said they would never see him again alive. I learnt that Charlton had thrown something down the cellar grating. I went into the cellar and found a razor covered with blood. The body of Charlton was found in the reservoir, three- tuacters of a mile distant, at 4 o'clock in the morning. had known Charlton 20 years. He never bore a very good character. I saw Normington run away when I heard the scream, and he told me that-he was afraid that he mig4ki he blamed foranythingthat had taken place. After some other evidence and a brief address from the Coroner, the jury returned a verdict of " Wilful Murder" Pgainst Samuel Charlton. The Coroner then proceeded to the New Miller'sDam Inn, Thornton-road, Bradford, a mile distant, and held anin quest on the body of Samuel Charlton. The deceased was a stout-built man, 58 years of age. Police-sergeant Knowles.-I mi sergeant of the Horton division of the Bradford police force. From information I received, I searched through the fields on School-moor for the murderer. After two hours' search I was joined by Mr. Burniston, superintendent of the night police, and we went to New Miller's Dam. At the dam aide about 4 o'clock in the momning I saw a hat floating on the water; I took it out and found it to be the hat, with crape round it, worn by the deceased. We went along the dam side 100 or 150 yards, and saw the body of Charlton standing perpendicularly in the water,four or five yards from the side. I obtained a boat-hook, drew out the body, and conveyed it to theNew Miller's Dam public-bouse. The body had no marks about it, and looked quite fresh, as though it had not been in the water many minutes. I have had Charlton in custody for felony, and recently he was committed to Wakefield House of Correction for a month, under the Worsted Act for embezzlement. IIs charac-er wasgenerallybad. I have known that hekeptcompany with Hannah Holroyd, snd that he frequently stayed in her houEe all night, I have no doubt that he was of perfectly sound mind. Henry Jowett, a Court Leet constable, said he had known Charlton for 20 or 30 years He was a man of vesy bad character. He was generally considered of sound mind, aud no alteration had been observed in him. The jury, after considerahle opposition by one juryman returned a verdict of "Feo de sey" The Coroner remarked that this was the first instance, among 3,000 inquests that he had held, of a verdict of fcEo de se aving been returned. It is required in the case of flo de se that the body of the deceased shall be interred within 24 hours of the verdict being returned, and between tho hours of 9 o'clock and midnight. The proceedings at the second inquest did not termiate until after 5 o'clock on xWednesday evening.

GovERiaLwT SAVYGs-BAzms Bcrz.-Yesterday afternoon a deputation, consisting of Mr. Paget, M.P., Mr. Pritchard, M.P., Mr. Whateley, Q.C., Mr. C. B. Lewis, and othor gentlemen, waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Downing-street on the subject of the Government Savings-Banks BilL The Rev. Mr. Bowen, Mr. ewis, and other gentlemen explained their objections to the Bill. Tho Chancellor of tle Exchequer said there appeared to be some misunderstanding on tho part of the publio in reference to the Bill. It seemed to bo the impression that Governu ent was asking for groat powers, and that they intended to interfere with the position of- managers and tra*eesL Nolbiog was further from tho fast than 'that the Government were desirous of encroa hing ipon skvfigs-bahics, and if 'tliy consalted their own feelings and interests thoy would probably leave them as they were. But theopresent state of things was untisfactory to the public interest, for the reason that an opinion generally prevailed that Government was liable for deposits, and whenever there were any defalcations applications wero made to Government to repay the losses. That was an inconvenient state of things f'r the Government and the public, which he thought the proposed Bill would provide against. It was not to be exnectsd that Government wbald make themselves responsible without some sufficient guarantee that the trust ehould not be abused. There was no intention to interfere with toe privileges of trustees and managers. A long discussion then ensned upon the details, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who bad the assistance of Sir Alexander S ean, contending that the Bill was not liable to the charges which had been preferred against it. The deputation then withdrew. ACCOMatODATION FOR TRY STEAm Tr-ADE AT LIVERPOOI-LIVERPOOL, My 14-To-day, at the meeting of the Dock Committee, a long communication was real from Mr. Charles M'Iver, agent at Liverpool for the Cnand Company and for the Australiam Mail Steamship Company, in reply to observations made during the diecussion which followed the reading of Messrs. Bibby and Sone' application for increased accommodation for their. steamers at a previous meeting. Mr. M'Iver reterred to the varios branches of trade in which the vessels of bis firm were engaged, and to the dock accommodation afforded to them, for tbe purpo6q of disproving a statement to the effect that his firm had greater accommodation, in proportion to their requirements, than other owners of steamships in the port. In order to show the numerous character of his particular trades Mr. ]WIver stated that during the four montbs of the present year their outwArd tonnage amounted to 44,514 tons, or at the rate of 13;342 tons a-year;. and their inwardtQnnage to43,744 tons, or at the rate of 131,232 tons a-year. In addition to this their coasting trade was very large, and their coal tonnage alone from South Wales engrossed about 1,000 tons of shippingper annum. It ivas elicted during the conversation which followed that Mr. M'Iver did not really get as miuch accommodation, in proportion to the extensive tharacter of his trade, as mazy pri. vate firms L the portk

I hamb frequently so4 s tbem tgether during that period-almost daily, I may say. Last night I saw Fox about a jnarter pAstS o'cock, near bhe Queen'sArnus, nearly oppo te-myownreidA6ee, Isakehim what -was the matter. He said, "I Am deeived, Gurney." I asked him in what. He replied, -"In-ME. Hadley," m eaning thedeceased. He then asked meunoe - my oathifIcouldkeepasecret. I naid, "Yes." Hether. tookaLpistol from his right-band pocket loaded.-with. acap. on it. . It was a single-barrel pistol. It was one ofthepistols now produced (gmall pocket pistols). He said, " There, it is loaded with a bulle' " He at the same timetook fronm his pocket a small bag, contiining four smabullets (prod aced) and said they were the remainder of them,. He added, "If this won't do for iss Hladley. the other four shall before I go to bed this night." I then said to. him " Don't do that, but come home with me to my house. while I have a wash." He did so. I told him then thaw we would go to the Cambride aArms, to this room. WhilUhe was there I told my wife to go and tell 3Mir Hadley what hua taken place. Fox and myself then-came to thfnroom and had Eome refrsahment, Fom haing & bottl oEC ler-bner, and myself a pint of porter. While we worep it I said to him, "What ashocking thing it,' woulde for you to take the yonng woman's life a*ay, for w you would be sure to get hung for it." Eereplied donotcaread-about being hun ponrscrffld, y morethan I do of shooting her." Mrs. Hadley (the deoesse& mother) and her aunt came here. I wentto the door to herand told her that he had two pistols with him. She then left. Shortly afterwards Fox and myelf went from here, sandhekept walling upanddownbythefront of lAdleS. house for about 10 minutes or so. He also got over er b2ck gate leading to the premises of the father of the des ceased. Ms Hadley went and tapped at her window, when he went through tho house and let her in. Shesaid "What, Steve, are you here?' I afterwards saw hiii walking about the streets, between 11 and 12 o'clock. Mrs., Hadley went to the station-house for the police to take him.. into custody. About half-past 10 Inspector Parker and the. man on the beat came. Fox ran away, but I saw him after that. The deceased slept with my wife last night, in ccnsequence of the conduct of Fox. I went to bed about 12 o'clock. This morning Igot up about5 o'clock, andwalke&L about, but could not see anything of Fox. About 7 o'clock I accompanied the deceased towerds Vauxhall, where- she vas going to work. Just as we reached the last ¶at-' of the cavalry barracks Fox rushed out from a lane o by, and presented two pistols-one at me, and the otherat the deceased-at the same time saying, "If yon, Gurney, come one step further I wiU blow your brainspout." I stood still, but the deceased crossed towards- the.- hedge to get by him. He was in the centre of the road. Herr..n across the road after her, and fired both pistols at her. Having done it, ho tried to run away, but I followed-him, took the pistols from him, and then, with assistanop,'toolk: bim to the station-house at once. I saw the deceased fall. I saw the men take her aw*y. While going tothe stationbouseFox said, "I am on]ysorryIhadnotmoreofthoethings, or a revolver, and you would not have got away, as E- did not mean to be taken-" I gave the pistolsto-poioe-. constable Epps at the Eame time that Idehvered ox intohis custody. Harriet Hadley (the mother of the deceased) was nextexamined. She deposed,-Tbe deceased is my daughter, rrd was 25 years oE age. Stephen Fox has been keeping company with her for the lat 18 months.. He used to come down nearly every night. He-- came to my house about 9 o'clock yesterday' morning, anc remained there till about a quarter past 12, when he left to- go home to dinner. The deceased was not at home at that.- time. While ho vas at my house he said he wished to se Mary Ann (the deceased) again that night, and it wouldthea-t be all right. I said, " No, Stephen, you are quito mistaken; she does not intend to have anything more tosay to you, although I have had nothing to do withi breakng this off; but you know that I never liked you, nor none of my family, for wve did not like your bohaviour and the character which you have. She haw. beard so muchtbatbhe is-determined sbe willnothaveanything moreto do with you." lfydaughter camohomeabonu.. G last evenine. and remained there until she left to sleep at MSr. Gurntes, About 7 oselock Fox camo to my houee, and inquired if the deceased was at home. As she did not, wish to seo bim, I told a story, and sarid she was not. Heleft directly. I afterwards went to the Cambridge Arms. (this house) and saw Fox in the company of Gurney. r ,poke to hIm, but I can't say now what I saidto him. About 9 o'olock, or a little after, I saw Fox agai, nearGurney's house. I said, "You can't see Mary Ain. and itis of no use your waiting." He replied, " I will by fairmeans or fou'L" I then said, " If you wil1 you must go tothe other end of the town to see her." I went and saw thepoiceman on duty, who advised me to go to the staonhouse and inform Mr. Clements what had taken place. I went to the station-house and I told him that I eonsidered my dangher's life indanger. I told himaFox ha pistols w ith him. I made a charge of the conduct of ox, and Mr. Clements sent a man with ume. That was a. little after 10. At Broad-street ve met another policeman, who also accompanied us. Betwreen Newr Iutthrgton-lanea3nd Union-streei w e met Fox. I said to him, "Ngowr, youz sayyou want two more words with Mary Ann-Yes orNo. If you ill allow these policemen to search you yoa_ sball seo her." He replied, "No, I will come in the morning." I said, " You shan't come in the morning; you. shan't cometormyhouse anyimore." He replied. "Verr well, I will not." One of theb llien said, ' What haveyou got heror' Fox said, " it is a cigar case," at the sametune pulling something out of his pocket. One of thapolicemen said, ' "We cam't take him without you give hirm in charge." I then said, " Then, I do give him in charge." Fox said, "What have I been doing?' The policeman. said, " You be off; and if you are here again, we will takeyou." Fox then left, and so did the police. By the Jury.-Last Tuesday a letter was sent by the. deceased to Fox. She told me what the letter contained. The following letter was then putin and read, it havingbeen taksen by Constable Epps from the prisoner Fox'& pocket:- Sir,-Your oonduct or late has been anything bht what it sboulL he when a rounn man considecs himself eneajise.

Police-constable Eppsdeposed,-About 7 o'clock this mor-. ning Stephen Fox was brought to the station-house chargL I with shooting Mary Ann Eadley. I asked If she was dead_ They sad they did not know. On searching the prisoner L found the four bullets, powder flask, some caps, and the. letter produced in his pocket. While I was searching him, Gurney said, " This is a bad job, Stephen." Fox replied,. "There were six bullets, but I hope the other two havea gone tbrough her." While Fox was in my custody he said he wmas happy and comfortable, and he was ready to meeb. his fate, as she had brought it on herself. They went tochapel together on Sunday last, and they had made it. their habit to do so twice every Sunday. lie had worked Ibard to et things together, and they were going out for s& June, Ie was to have seen her the next day, but he did not, which exasperated hiEn. On Tuesdar evening he sawv her about 10 'clock, but did not eeO heragain t;ill this morning. It was very hard to his feelings, as he had worked hard toha>ve everything ready forthem.

The prisoner w'-s examuined beforo the magistrates yester. day afternoon. The evidence was similar to that given at.- tho inquest. When it was concluded the prisoner was aske& what he had to say in answer to the charge. He replied," Of course, the reason why I did it was because she deceived me. I had promised her marriage, and sho consented. I went to her house on Monday evening, but she was not afhome. I left about 9 o'clock. I went again on Taesday at. 6o'cloclk.andshevwsnotathomethen.
