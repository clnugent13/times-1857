OUB -)rLA TIONS WITH BP.AZ. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE Tl1Eg. Sir,-To the juste and true wisdom of the moral jyo draw from last igfts debe I cn ad no force. I cnhn myself to the expreasion of ahope that you wil cont>ltn. to interest your ournal in this really important subje. My object in again intuding on you is simply to point out that Lord John Russell mistales the post hoc for the, pirpter hoc. Because the law of Brazil againsb the Atria= slave trade bears date after the notificatiou which Admrai! Reynolds issued, under Lord Palmerston's instruction of April 22, 1l50, to British craisers, Lord John Russell infure that the law was the consequence of the instructions, This is a complete mistke. The law in quesoion was introduced into the Chambers in 1849, and was under discussion and had been nearly enacted before Admiral Hey. nolds's notification was issued. The debates on the laq turned, not upon the Act of 1845, or on the additional vio^ lence which had been ordered by Lord Palmerston, but oc domestic considerations entirely; and the reasons for itz enactment willbe found in an extract from the speech oe Senhor Euebio, then Minister of Justice, given at page 163s appendix A to the Report of the Commons Committee u our Slave Trade Treaties, 1853. I entreat you to eaed it. Lord John appears to think that, between the imae o} Admr--l Reynolds'3 notification, June 22, 1850, and the date of the law, September 4, 1850, the lose of the slavtrades under the notification were so great that the trade became wholly Inprofitable. Lord John is again mistaken. Althlugh the orders ti, violate the teritoril waters of the empire very naturalil produced grt indignation in Brazil, they produced verp few captures in those water Lord Aberdeen's Act passea in 1S45. In 1847,45,173 Africans were imported into Brazil, Lord John Russaell being in office in that year; in 184S, 60.0Oo, ixn 49> 54,000; in 1850, nersly as may. In 1851 the Brazilia law came into full play, and the importations dropped at ozce to 3,287, and in 1852 to 700. Lord John Russe wa, out of office in 1852, and if thepost hoclropter hoc style oF rasoning be of aDy avil I might as well argue that the. falling off in the importations was the consequence of his. being out ooffice, as he to contend that the Brazilianlair was the consequence of the orders of his Cabinet On the 27th of April, 1852, lord Derbfs Cabinet revoke& those orders, not on any agreement with the Braziia:!, Government, but because that Government-to quote Lo,rj Malmesbury's language- have used sincere and effctuaj exertions for the suppression of the slave trade." If, as Lord John argaes, the suppression of the trade w3a the result of the orders of his Cabinet, on their revocatioM its revival to some extent might have been anticipated. The reversO has been the case. From April, 1853, dowi to the present time, only 23 Africans have been importe& into BraziL Why? l'ot beamuse of the Act of lM45; forijt operation, says lord Palmerston, has been suspended Th%, reason is in the Brazilian lav of 1850 and in the effective. manner in which it was carried out. But, argues Lord Palmerston, although the Emperor is ti earest, though the Government is active, though the Chambes are honest, though the Brazilian squadron ij_ efficient, there is still a "proneness" in Brazil towards the African slave trade. In the last four years we only knovr of tro slave Tentures in Brazil, and both were from theUnited States. One asthe case of the waryE. Smith. She twice attempte& to land her cargo, and twice the inhabitants of the spotk where she made the attempts repulsed her, and she w.s beating about in want of water and in distress when she was taken in the bay of St. Matthew by a Braeilian cruime. The other case occurred at Scrinhaem. In it there is a- dispute as to the fats, the Brazilian Government censuring and prosecuting for complicity in the affair one of its fuse. tionaries, whom the British Govemment insisted on thank. ing for his exertions. But of one thing there is no dispute; that the Brazilian police have recovered all but 23 Aficas on board the vesael, and restored those they did reoover to freedom. This "pronenes is, therefore, rather an apprehensio, in L rd almerston's mind than an actuality warranted by facts. The Act of 1845 has now become a point of honour. Lora John Russe and Lord aimerston insst that their orders. of the 22d of April, 185, have "done it all," that their_ is the merit, that theirs ought to be the applause. The. Brazilian Government, as I think with greater truth ana justioe, deny that they yielded to foreign coercion.

These supposed cass have been submitted for examina& tion to an offioer whose duty requires exct and technic knowledge in matters affecting theintrcate subject of army. pay, and he pronounces them to be cases which must in.- evitably arise in the course of the working of the w,ant of January 16a It can never have been inEtnded to frame an order whicW seemsto give a private an interest to a certain extent i, avoidng promotion to the grade of sergeant, and whicbb even admits of sergeants at one time reduced to privates for misconduct, but re-promoted, being in a better position thba old sergeants of 20 years' service, wno never incurred disgrace. The remedy is very simple. It is this :-Every sergeant, being-virtually a good-conduct man, ougnt injustice to receive the additional good conduct ring every dive years, aw if he were a well-conducted private, besides having his. good-conduct pay. I sendyon an extract from a letter from another sergeant,. explaining the grievance I have the honour to be, Sir, your obadient servant. J. S. TREL&wNy.

4fONRY-MARKBTaCITdYIINTEBLIGBNaOB. MondAy Evening. T'he funds opened this aorning at the closing 1a-ices of Saturday, and Bubsequently experienced an improvement of an eighth, although there was mot much appearance of animation. Consols for unoney were first quoted 93n to i, from which -ley advanced until there were buyers at 94, and tlbe final prices were 93i to 94 for money and 94i ,to (or 93 to i ex. dividend) for the 9th of July. Mhe principal transactions of the day consisted of epeculatve purobases for the account. Money was :csrce at 6e per cent. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 214; educed, 92_ to @; Nevr Three per Cents., 92i to i; India Stock, 221 to 223; India :onds, 8a. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds 981 -to i; and Exchequer bills, June, par to 3s. pm.; afrcb, 2s. to 6s. premium. In the diecount-market and at the Bank of England to-day there was an increased demand, which is likely to be maintained until Thursday, when the <Consol settlement will have to be provided for in *ddition to the customary requirements of the 4th -of the month. Foreign securities have not been largely dealt in, but Tturkish was firmer, with an increased amount .uf busines. The Six per Cents., for the account, -were negotiated at 95* and 95, and the Four per Cents. guaranteed, for money, at 101 and '. The * general transactions comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., for the account, 10O*; Rothsehild's Five per <Cents., 97 ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per CentB., 7P'7i ; and the Small, 97i ; Sardinian Five per ¢Cents., for the account, 89j and 89; Spanish New 3)eferred, for the account, 25k; Belgian Four-and-aHIalf per Cents., 96i ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 656; the Four per Cents., Certifcates, for ononey, 97i; and for the account, 97. In the corn-market this morning the advance of Ibetween Is. and 2s. realized on Friday last was *ustained. The final quotation of the French Three per <Cents. on the Paria Bourse this evening was 69f. 30c. for the present account, showing a fractional -decline.

Erie were quoted 41 to i; New York Central, 86#; Reading, 79 to A; Panama, 94 ; and Illinois Central, 39 premium-the Bonds, 100. Notwithstanding the large exports of specie by the last two or three packets, the supply Iheld by the New York banks had slightly increased, the drain having besn fully met by the receipts from the interior and from California, together -with the disbursements from the Federal Treasury, whicb, until the new tariff should -come into operation on the 1st of July, were likely to continue larger than tha collections. The arrivals .rf sugar had lately been very heavy, owing to the iigh prices attained. Estimates of the results of the {rade of the UJnited States for the fiscal year which 'will close on the 30th inst. had been put forth, and -they show the value of the importations of goods 'o have been 72,000,0001., or 10,000,0001. in excess -of the 12 months ending June, 1856. Of specie the importations are stated at 3,000,0001., against 2,150,0001. last year, while the export of Californian gold has been 12,000,0001., ag,ainst 9,000,0001. The latest news from California was satisfactory with regard to mining operations, the yield being now alleged tobeasgreatasatanyperiod. InCaliforniaStateSeven 'per Cents. a further rapid rise had taken place, and the latest transactions were at 566. This was owing -to the fact of a Bill having been introduced into the ,Californian Legislature to provide for the payment -of the interest due in July and January next, which bad been passed by the Senate, and was before the MHouse of Assembly. It proposes to levy a tax of 30 cents on each $100 worth of taxable property, 'which will yield a revenue of $300,000 a-year, and leave leave $27,0010 annualy as a sinking fund for the liquidation of the principal in 1876. the claim .of the State against the Federal Government, ;amounting to nearly $3,000,000, being the moneys -collected for duties at the Californian ports prior to {he admission of the State into the Union, is also to be devoted to the debt. The measure, horever, 'will have no effect unless sanctioned by a -general vote of the people of the State, which -will be taken in September next. From Casnada it is stated that the Relief Act for the ,Grand Trunk Railway passed the House of Assembly 'on the 13th of May by a majority of 13, and that it was to go before the Legislative Council on the 19th, -where it was certain of approval. The Bill dismenBes with Government directors, and prov ides that the management of the company shall be vested entirely in those appointed by the sbareholders. The company are to render lalf-yearly an attested balance-sheet, and the <Gevernment may at any time order an exaanination by the Board of Audit. The Government -forego all interest on their claim against the company, except in any year when there shall be a surplus profit of more than 6 per cent. on the share capital, and an additional year is granted for the completion of the works beyond the period men-honed in the Act of 1856. Thze Montreal City Corporation Bonds, which fell due sore weeks ago, and 'which it was feared had not been provided for, have -been paid in full. The trade reports for the past week a'low con-tinued inactivity at Manchester andthe surrounding towns, prices exhibiting a degree of weakness likely bto lead to an extended adoption of the short time mnovement. The Birmingham accounts describe steadiness in the iron-market, and an average home .and foreign business in the other manufactures of the place. In the woollen districts the increased -firmness observable last week has been maintained, and the Irish linen-mnrkets are without alteration. The commercial accounts from India to-day are catisfactorv. At Bombay, although the transac'lions had 6en limited, the demand was healthv, ;and prices had been well supported. At Calcutta -the advices of the state of trade in the interior had led to considerable purchases, and in some cases an cadvance bad been realized. From Shanghai, also, it is mentioned that a good business had taken place .at xather improved rates. The Alnwick Castle has arrived from Sydney with acvices to the 14th of March, being four days later -ban those previously received. A proposal had Nbeen made by the Chamber of Commerce for altering the usance of exchange on England from 30 to '90 days' sight. The Orinoco steamer for the West Indies and 'Mexico wfil take out 31,750-viz., 11,7501. gold, and the remainder silver. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the week have comprised eight vessels-three to Port Phillip, two to Sydney, -two to Launceston, and one to Adelaide-with an -aggregate capacity of 5,672 tons. The rates of -freight show no material variation. In the general business of the port of London .during the past week there bas been considerable activity. The number of ships reported inward was 241, being 62 below the large total in the previous account. Those included 65 with cargoes of wheat, zrice, oats, &c.; 25 with cargoes of sugar, and one cargo of tea and silk. The number of vessels -cleared outward was 125, including 15 in ballast, showing an increase of 22. At a meeting on Friday of the Shipwrecked alarmers Society it was resolved to appropriate 15,0001. of its funded property to bead a subscription for an institution to be called the Royal Hospital -for worn-out and disabled merchant seamen, Eng*and, it is said, notwithstanding her pre-eminent interests, having hitherto in this respect been behind most other countries. A public meeting is wproposed to be called at an early date at the Man:aion-house in aid of the work thus commenced, and the co-operation of the Board of Trade is relied -upon. The annexed account of the Manchester markets ,during the past month is from Messrs. Robert 13arbour and Brother:- "7lihe busine-s transactions of the month in this market .have been on a verv limited scale. Stocks in coisequentce have increased, and the tendency of pries haa been downwards. The reduction in values will now amount to about 72 to 5 per cent. since March, and it would doubtless have Vbeen grter did not the majority of spinners and manufacturers Bnd it ruinous to yield further. Most of them have litberto kept their machinery running the usual number -of hours veeldy on acoount of the great los and inoonvemienco of working a short time,' but now the market value -uf yarns, and more especially of manufactured goods, is so mnuch under the cost that a general movement his commnenced to workonly'four da7s a-week; mnny miib wMill bs closed entirely during next week, though it is only usasl to atop two or three dids at Wintsenth, We gezt to S attQ tbhat several failurealive taken place, arising from the uaremuaerative state of the trade for some time paat. "In the Liverpool eatton-masket the quotations for the curreut qualities of American have been folly supported, and iA Eome cases a smali advance has beea obtained. The stock, as usual at this seagon, has been considerably inwear; prices are, however, 14d. to lid. per lb. higher. It is expected the imports will now considerably fall off. as there are at sea only 40,200 bales of American and 106,000 Surats, against 149,600 American and 56,700 Surats same time last year." On the silk-market Messrs. Waithman and Co. report as followvvs " The silk-market has been quiet during the past month, buyers generally waiting with anxiety some certain information as to the result of the European crop. Early in the month, notwithstanding the inclement weather which ther prevailed, the news from all the silk-producing districts was decidedly favourable, and sanguine hopes were entertained that the crop would prove to he a fair average one* soon, however, rumounr of disaster began to arinve, totwlschat first but little attention Was paid; ltterly the accounts from all quarters have been so very unfavourable that all ex pectation of a good ore p is entirely dispelled. *-The China letters delivered this morning brig dates from Shanghai to the 6th of ^ rl The settlements for the month had amounted to 5,000 hales, makig the total settlerDents to dates 79,000 bales; the shipments wvere 75,800 bales, in addition to which about 2,400 bales were on boardi ships in port. Stock on the maket 5,000 bales. Prices had fluctuated considerably during the month, and, although the closing quotations in dollars were sli3htly lower than those of the previous mail, the cost of silk had been enhanced by the great advance in exrchange to 7s. 5d." The annexed is from the United Mexican Mining Aesociation - iExtracts of a Despatch from the Commnissoners dated Guanaxuato, April 13, and received vi0 the United States. ]Dajor Farrell writes,- ' Jesus Maria y Jose.-This mine has continued, with very little deviation, in its favourable results since my last advice. The southern section of the mine is now the most productive. There the ore shown in the frentes (north and south) of Dolores, the pozo and crosscut adjaoent, measures 24 yvams In the length of the vein, with a width of 4 varms, and height about 6 varas. I The extraction fo. the'week ending thel4th inat.was of picked or clean ore 760 cargas, and for the week ending the 11th inst. 366 cargas (average ley from 9 to 10 mares per monton, with an increased proportion of gold). This diminished extraction was only attributable to a week of holydays, the miners workiog only three days in the holy week. The sale of ore on the lst inst., to which I made allusion by anticipation in my previous letter, consisted of 996 cargas, and realized $4,758-the largest amount we have yet had. The first sale (as will be seen by reference to my letter of the 26th of January) produced for a smilar amount of carg- only $i2,600-a very evident proof, were other wanting, that the ore has improved in value and is in greater request. Independently of the carga sold the haciendas, including Mr. Furber's 12 arra_tres, have been fully supplied."' The payment of the interest has been advertised on the New South Wales Government debentures due the 1st of July, and on those of tihe Melbourne Gas Company__

Tnx ATr Ina TFLGRIAH OABLE.-We learn that Her Majesty's ship Agamemnon left Sheerness at 5 20 a.m. on Friday, for Liverpool, and may therefore be expected here hourly. She has been specially fitted for carrying and laying the Atlantic Telegraph cable, and is ss well suited for the purpose as If she had been expressly built with that object. Her engines being situated nearer toithe ster than is usual enables the cable to be stowed almost amid-ships, so aS to preserve the trim of the vesseL A large hold, capable of receiving tho cable in one coil, of the form which has been found by experience to be the best, has been cleared out, and a flooring lid over the kelson. The size of tha division of the hold, fitted, for the cable Is about 50 ft. square, and the coil of 1,250 miles of cable will be about 11 ft. high. At present she draws only 19 ft. of water, her armament and super. fluous stores having been removed; when the cable is on board this will be increased to 25 feet. A guard, or cage, of wrought-iron has been placed over the propeller, so as to avoid any chance of the cable getting foul of it. The machinery for paying out the cable, which is being made at Manchester, is ;f the most complete character, providing for every possible emergency; tho precise atrain borne by the cable, the exact amount delivered, the rate at which it is payed off, and other important particulars, being indicated during the whole process. The peculiar arrangement of the apparatus is such as to provide for every contingency which experience haa pointed out as possible to occur in the paying out- of either light or heavy cables. Frigates' masts have been fitted to the Agamemmnon, in place of the heavier gear usually carried by her, to render ber more suitable for the operaticn. -Her engines, which are by Penn, ar consldered to be equal, if not superior, to aiything afloat. They are nominally of 800-horse power, but have been worked up to 2,250. This power will not be needed in this case, for it is now to be expected that the cable will be laid at more than four to five knots per hour. 1,100 miles of the cable have now been completed by Messrs. Nevvall and Co., at Birkenhad, out of the 1,250 miles to be made there. This is laid in four coils, of about 25 feet diameter, and will be shipped in suitable vessel3 and coiled into the Agamemnon, in the Sloyne. Much as it is to be regretted that Liveool bhas not been favoured with the anticipated visit of the United States' steamer Niagara, originally intended to take on board the cable at Birkenhead, it will be seen from the foregoing that the sudden derangement of the plan previously designed is not likely to cause delayin carrying out this great enterpris, through the meaures which are being so Yromptly taken by the Government to provide an addionat ship to compensate for the very great disappointment -which has been so generany felt at the peculiar constructien of the Niagara unfitting her for this particular service, although so splendid a ien of naval architecturoein other ways; z:t Cha r right, the engineer of this great undertaking, has been in Liverpool during the last week making the necmry arrgements for coiling the cable on board of the Agamemnon. Fhi will lie in the Sloyne, in consequence of her breadth not allowing her to enter the Birkenhead Dock, and the cable will he carried to her in other veels. Mr. Bright expeota that hisplans will allow of the Agamnmnon-leaving here outhe ISth of July, to meet the other ships at Cork on the 18th, so tbat we may expect the cable to be laid in the firsteek in August, which is the period of the year. most free, on the average. from wnnd and fog, amd therefoie besd calculad for the comple. tion of the underta1dng.- etVr4o4 AThW.

The receipts of English wheat were 6,791 quarters; of fore:gn (chiefly Russian and from the Baltic), l9,503 quarte's.

In malt there was no change. - There was a good supply of oats-viz., 37,828 qulzters, eoosisting of 845 quarters E- ngis, 1,000 quarters Irish, and the remainder foreign, of which. 21,000 quarters were front .Russia. The number of sampleson show somewhat checkedi the steadiness of s3ie, but the previous rates were maintained. There were 423 quarters English beans and 1,013 quarters foreign.

VOT7q1 CA YOUB ON SIB a PRBL. In t'he zIttn]gof the Sardiniau Senateof t123ti xlt. Count Cavour made DoMO very just observatinsepoicy of the late Sir Roecrt I lel. The y of Egland having beea quoted as an mple for the gdual introduction of free hade mneasures, Count Cavour said,- " Before concluding I must reply to an obeervatioa made yesterday by ML Sclopis and Galina. They quoted the example of England anc tTe authority of Sir B. PeeL ?,T* Seopis expreased his astonishment that I had not followed tbeexanp!e of theillustrioustatemznof whom I have often spolken with great respect, whenIdeclared that I entertained the highest opinion of English institutions, of the empl given to us by thoe English people in political and economical reform. In fact, I more thn once mentioned Sir Robert reel as one of the greatest and most illustriousr e formers of our century. I have no 'wsh to retrc the princioles I have often professed before you; bat, while I consider it advisable for statesmeen of ever country, especiaUly for the statesmen of Piedmont, tostuay the institutions of EDnglad, it is because I tink they may learn much to profit by, and also how to avoid many errors committd by Englishmen. EngIand. was -th first to advance in the'path of eonomil reforms, and - for thatveryresonsshe was obliged to advanoo cautioudy. But, gentlemen, when the refcur was accomplished, do you think that those who opposed it dcled that it war wel to have advanced cautioudy ? lo, gentlemen; andSir EoS-ert Peel himself, when he said free trade had calbned the crisis of 1S47, expressae his regret that ise- sai nothad the comrage to propose it 20 years earlier to Dre. vent the crisis of 1824. I therefore think that it woeljd bha a folly not only to follow the example of England in fthe reforms realized, but also in the manner of aocompliabinz them. Let us learby the experience of others; let us ba warned by the errors of othernations not to commit slmiltr errors ourselves, and when we behold those nations who have attained great prospity proclaim certain princples in an absolute manner, let us adopt them, and apply them to as full an extent asitisinourpowertodo. Kanyofbth reform3 whieh we have boldly adopted were only acmplished gradually ia England. The Corn Law Bill only passed after a straggle of 25 or 30 year The struggle commenced in 1817, and lasted till 184I, when Sir Bobert Peei caused the Bill to pass. And here, while following in the steps of Envglnd, we havs yet adoptad free trade ae once; we have even gone a-head of E1ngland, for she maintains still a duty-slight, it is tre -while we have abolished it altogether. And now I must reply to the quotation of Sir BRoert Peel as an authority I repeat it, I entertain the highest aamirationforthat states. man; I believe thatfew menhave rendered greater aervioesto nkiLnd thanhehas. YetIdo not believethatSirRobert Peel vws always infallible in his political career. It is my opinion that Sir R. Peel would have lefta much more iustrious name behind him it, instead of having been coint pelled by circumstances to introduce reforms, he himslf had originated them. I think that Sir Robert Peet would have left behind him a fame unequalled in history if, instead of proposing the emancipation of the Catholies in 1829, he had proposed it in 1825; I think that his nanme would have eclipsed all those of ancient and 3modern statesmen if the reform of the corn laws had baen initiated in 1840-a good harvest year-instead of being paesed in consequence of the famine which desolated Ireland, and instead of being in some measure a consequence of the potato disease. En fact, if Sir Robert Peel had been the originator of reforms, he would at his death have left to his friends a political inberitance far different from that which he bequeathedt them. If SirR. Peel had associated his naame and his vhole career with successive reforms, there would be no need of recording at the present time a strange fact which has tak;en place in England-namely, thata party consisting of eminent men, including the most eloquent speaksr in Parliament, and the most able legilators, has been completely routed at the late elections. And this, gentlemen, is the fate of parties vho allow themselves to be led by public opinion, and who wait to the last moment to carry out reforms which they have not the couxage to introduce. I trust that the Senate, convinced of this truth, wil give its support to the present Government, which, while followlng the exanmple of Sir Robert Peel, nevertheless deviates from the course he adopted by making itself the originator of reforms, not wishing to grsat them to any popular pressure, nor to the pressure of unforesesa circumstances."
THE GERMAN LRGIO1. TO T}E EDITO. OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The remasrs proceeding from several members of Parliament relating to the German Legion are so illiberAl and, at the same time, so at variance with the trabt, that f beg to offer you the following facts for pabli-cation, should )ou thin fit. Mr. Bebow was in error when he stated that the men of the legion were anxious to remain in the service and pay oF England; the very reverse was the case. Short as their period of service was, they were already heartily tired of and disgusted with it. The reasons are obvious At the time these regimeats were being formed the urgenuc of'the moment and the miserable provisions nade by the Act for officers on their final disbandment compellod Baron Stttterheim to accept the services of menx who haa previoasly left other arnies under circumstances not very much to their credit, and I regret to say ib required the fall energy of commanding officers to procure the men their dues. In fact, with few exceptions, the only officers to be d&pended upon were thosa geLtlamen, Euglish and German. vho had thrown up their commissions in other armies in order to serve under colours which their fathers had nor disgraced, and who are all now suffering for their folly. Add to this the prejudice with which these regiments were viewed at Aldershott and elsewhere, and you will easily conceive that the service became as unpopular to the men of the legion themselves, as it was to the majorit7 of Englishmen. To speak the truth, these "petted Germans" were not so muchto be envied asisgenorallysupposed. The "agree_ able trip to the Bosphorus and back"' was enlivened by v orking at the pumps of the renowned Transit for five days aLd nights in the Bay, the cholera and typhus at Scutazi and encamping on the heights of KElolea daring the winter months, where the sight of a Rlias, would have been a godsend to one and all. After their return to England, ab. the very time they were amusing "Alr. liebow and tha nurseryinaids of Essex," they were daily and in vaini etitioning to be at once disbanded, end the failure of the Caps scheme was no secret to any officer really acquainted with the feelings of the men long before the con. ditions appeared. Of the 2,000 and odd men who at last, by dint of all sorts of persuasion, consented to go to the Cape, two-thirds went agaist their will; hence the different disturbances whicb, occurred at Browndown previous to their embarcation. As regards the possible service of those men now at tho Cape, Sir George Grey will undoubtedly find them useful at the present moment, small as their number is, and the only fear of their fraternizing with the Boers would be the jealous and petty feeling which prompted the remarks ix the House if extended to the Colonial Government. Had the expectations of Government been realizse, and 8,000 aen proceeded to the Cape as was expected, under properly selected officers, I have littlo doubt myself that the scheme would have proved completely successful from. the well-known fact that Germans are peculiarly adapted to colonizatiou, added to which there was a degree of intelli6ence among these men which was superior to ny I have yet met with in the ranks of other armies. But, Sir, the men viewed the total absenco of any real interest in their services with distrust, and were quite as anxious to take of£ the red coat as Enaland was to get rid of them. Let-members blame Government for the misapplicatiom cf public fonds at their discretion, but not base the force of ,heir argument on the abuse of mne of a nation which has-lways supplied ths deficiencies of our ownr military s3stem duxing European wars at the moment of need, and thata with a gallantry and military worth to which manyn veteran. of the Peninsularsampigns will bear full and ample testimony. I enclose my card, and, apologing for the length of my letter, remain, Sir, Your obedient servant. A LATE OFFICER OF THE LEGION. Bly 29.

LON7DON, TUESDAY, JUNE 2, is57. There is a certain point in all important inquiries not always attained to, simply because the inquinrr e worn out oranother generation has comeintotheir 1plac aud is treading in their footsteps, but never: theles a point which ought to be amived at soon or late. It is when people begin to ask themuelvea why they have inquired so long and to so li;tle purpose. Perhaps there preftnp itelf the iill graver question, whetier they have been really inquiring at all, and whether they have not been obstinately following the -thread of their own ideas, without giving a thought to the facts of the question. For a whole generation, to our certain knowledge, there has been a great deal of so-called inquiry on the Education of the Working Classes at that interesting age when boys and girls are no longer boys and girls and not yet men and women. In villages hundreds of evening schools have been started, and generally found failures. In towns we have had evening classes, adult classes, readingrooms, lectures, and all sorts of devices by which learIing is made as agreeable, and voluntary, and easy, and, of course, as good for nothing, as learning can be made. We believe that in all these cases, from the half-dozen lads got together by the attraction of roof, fire, and candle, to spell a chapter in the New Testament and do a sum in compound addition up to the more ambitious attempts made by enterprising philanthropists to teach apprentices and errandboys harmony, perspective, and the Nineveh antiquities, much good has been done. Some of the seed falls upon good soil. Curiosity has been roused, ideas have been implanted, sentiments have been inspired that have tended to elevate the mind, and made it use more ordinary means of instruction. Such attempts are not to be condemned for the preponderance of failures. Nor are they condemned. Zeal, however, fails with disappointment, and at this moment there is a deep sense of disappointment on this subject. With all our prodigious and costly school systemcostly to the nation or the parent, we discover that the first use our scholars generally make of their liberty is to give up learning and reading of any profitable character. Employers on all sides are complaining of the stupidity and ignorance of their young servants. Boys and girls, it is even alleged, are not so clever and handy as they were. They learnt more when they had to pick up their education any how; and boys were better educated, we have heard it said, when they went to the "commercial academy" kept by the surveyor, appraiser, and accountant-general of the district,-when, after revelling in the mysteries of " practice," they learnt to measure odd-shaped fields and crooked timber, than now when they learn everything. They have now read so much, heard of so many thing, and seen so many pictures of everything under the sun, that they don't care to learn. They have run through SOLOMON'S career at the age of 15-at least, the literary part of it-and are ready to exclaim, " Vanity of "Vanities I All is vanity and vexation of spirit. "There is nothing new under the sun." Just at the time, too, when this inquiry is approaching the stage of extreme perplexity and incipient despair, it so happens that the subjects of it, the young men and young women, have in one respect taken the law into their own hands, and rescued a good deal of the day from the dominion of labour. The early closing movement, the general rise of wages, the fresh openings now offering themselves to the enterprising or discontented, and the liberal ideas now current about labour, rest, and amusement, have contributed to shorten the daily task and release a great part of our population at an earlier hour. Indeed, now in summer, long before sunset, London looks almost like Sunday, but for the working-day clothes and the carriages going to the theatres. Old-fashioned tradesmen complain bitterly that when they are pressed to make up an order for some country customer, who thinks a day of importance, all their hands are off; it is a point of pride not to work after the closing hour. Then, so many live in the country, 'bumses and trains wait for no man, nor will tea and toast. This would be very pleasant, and we might afford to laugh at the old-fashioned tradesman and his country customer, but for a certain dark side of the picture, which philanthropy itself, with aU its enthusiasm and wilfulness, cannot quite shut its eyes to. Of late years, and particularly during the very period of this movement in favour of our shopmen and other workpeople, there has been a most lamentable but undeniable increase of questionable places of resort and unquestionable scandal. No one who is familiar with all parts of this metropolis can deny that certain vices, at least their public demonstrations, are immensely on the increase. For the ostentatious openness of these evils London-with, we believe, the single exception of Hamburg-has not a parallel in Europe. The reality may be worse elsewhere, but the show is less, the nuisance more suppressed. But this is the temptation, these the snares and pitfalls, of the very class which our modern education complains that it cannot grasp or recall-the very class that now quits the shop or the warehouse at an earlier hour. Benevolence in these days knows how to set free, but not how to catch again. It can break the fetter and snap the bar; force the prison door, and break down the walls; fill our colonies or our metropolis with liberty boys and girls, and so far restore the world to the semblance of happier times; but when the cage is thrown open, and the birds are fled, it may be to crime, to privation, and to suffering, it has not the art to call them back, or teach them how to use their liberty. No doubt, while philanthropy has in this instance rendered a very doubtful service to education, strangers and interlopers have reaped the harvest of freedom. As the Educationists are painfully aware of the difficulty, and appear to have arrived at that point of the inquiry when they have to ask why former efforts and former inquiries have failed, we will venture to offer a word of advice for their consideration at the Great Congress which is to be opened under the PRiNcx CowsonT on the 22d inst. On that day they are to meet and consider the early age at which children of the working classes are taken from school; and on the following day they propose to divide themselves for the consideration of various expedients to meet the alleged evil,-such as a strenuous effort to keep children longer at school, or to make a compromise with the employer. They expect to be able to report on these points the very day after, rhen it is evident they will only have had time to hear and either approve or condemn some papers already prepared before the 22d. Considering that this professes to be an inquiry, and an inquiry of a grave and diffioult character, coming upon many other unsuccessful inquiries, we cannot help r9garding such a mode of conducting it as little better than a farce, intending tobiss, and therefore stifie, inquiry rather than to promote it. So the word of advice we have to offer is, that they should set about their inquiry in the method. found so useful in physical sCience. Let them just inquire into the facts of the case. The conductors of our great educational institutions ought to have, more command of facts[than other people, anld on no subject are the facts so accessible as on Education. Inlead of three days let them give the whole summer to the inquiry. Let them follow oit the career of those young people who have been at their schools within a limited period; let them find out where those young people are, what they are doings how they. are getting on in life, in what " favour with GoD and man," and how they ar foUowing up the modicum of instruction received at the schools. Let them inquire also into the exsting resorts of the young, for good, or for bad, or for indifferent' purpo.. Let'them fn iwhat attendance is givea St MechaIs inti. -tutions, at lectures, classes, and other means of instruction, public or private. They may, rerchance, find some young people educating themselves, after a fashion, or congregated under teacbers who teach all the better for taking neither money nor advice from the State. But, at all events, we are strongly of opinion that something more than a three days' conference by old educational boards, by the names that have been before us twenty or thirty years, and something more than a mere hearing and receiving of well written reports, will be required before the public will sanction any further schemes for postponing, or shortening, or dividing that daily toil by which it is the lot of man to live. Labour is the great fact of human life, and we hesitate to interfere with its sacred obligations unless with the plainest necessity and in behalf of those who cannot help themselves. We should like to know how the newly acquired -leisure and the increased wages of our working population are employed now before we take, another step in this easy and pleasant, but perhaps downward direction.
Such laws as the Act for* the Regulation of Common Lodging-houses, passed six years agoj form a marked feature of this age. It may be said that we have traversed the great phase of constitutional legislation. The rights of the subject, the position of the various institutions of the country, the limit of Sovereign and Ministerial power, have all been settled by a long series of enactments after a long series of conflicts. The Constitution as it exists is now taken for granted by every one, and even a new Reform Bill finds people indifferent to a degree that scandalizes many veteran politioians. The country, in its heart, desires but one thing of its rulersAdrwinistration. With all our liberty, with all our exciting and ennobling political struggles, with our deep-founded securities for just government, and free opinion, we yet feel that in numberless practical matters we are behind continental neigh- I bours who have never had a constitution, or I have had one only to destroy it. While gazing on the immortal lights that stud the political; firmament we have fallen into very dangerous I or dirty pitfalls beneath us. An uneducated lower class, ill-built, ill-drained cities for them to live in, a river of sewage, and a labyrinth of choked thoroughfares, are some of the institutions which have grown up side by side with the fabric of civil and religious liberty. With the fall of the last fortresses of injustice and monopoly attention has been turned to these less regarded but still troublesome and inveterate evils. If all Englishmen are free, and in many respects equal, let them at least be clean. If the Palace of Westminster is the classic home of liberty and eloquence, let it not be hidden from admiration by smoke and soot. If Free Trade has brought the commerce of the world to the bosom of the Thames, let us be able to look upon this result of a wise policy without being offended by the odours of a thousaid sewers. Every one feels these things, and politicians who want a name are consequently sinking the patriot in the practical improver. Though the thing may one day be overdone, there certainly seems at present plenty of work for sound sense and honest purpose. As a proof of what can be done in an apparently hopeless field, we may give some details from a Report on the operation of the Lodging-house Act, which has just been presented to Parliament. Probably the most tcrrible, the most dispiriting sight in the world to a man of feeling, is a low London street of decaying houses, with a ginshop at one end and a pawnbroker's at the other. What is inside the crazy tenements may weU be judged by the sights, the sounds, and the smells which prevail outside. To introduce decency into those dens of mingled misery and indulgence, to cleanse those squalid rooms, and to thin that crowded and festering population might certainly seem impossible; yet a few years of determination and activity have sufficed to put an end to the evil in one of its worst forms, and to effect changes which must add greatly to the health and morality of town populations. In 1851 the Act was passed. " Before this "enactment," says the Report, " the evils existing "in the Lodging-houses of the poor were beyond "description. Crowded and filthy, without water "or ventilation, without the least regard to "cleanliness or decency, they were hotbeds of "disease, misery, and crime. Under the operation "of the Act the evils attending such houses have "been in a great degree removed or abated." The machinery by which the Act worlks is a system of registration and regulation enforced by domiciliary visits. Every person who keeps a common Lodging-house, which, we presume, means a house where persona may lodge for a single night, may be served with a notice warning him to register. Now, to obtain a register certain regulations must be complied with. On the certificate of the inspecting officer the register is granted; but if the house is not put into a proper state the register is refused, and then a night visit is made and evidence obtained on which to base proceedings before a magistrate. In every registered house there must be " clean beds and bedding, well ven"tilated and limewashed sleeping-rooms, well "cleaned kitchens, plenty of water for all pur"' poses," as well as other conveniences. That such accommodation can be afforded at a charge varying from 2d. to 6d. a-night shows how cheaply the poor can be sheltered with a little management, and what gains must have been made formerly by the keepers of these establishments. A few instances will show the change that has been wrought, and what kinds of houses have been proceeded against in order to effect it. At one house "in a room ten feet square, where only "three persons would be now allowed, there were "found seven men, nine women, and one child "huddled together in the most filthy state; the "bedding dirty beyond description, no partitions "or ventilation, and a few minutes before the "visit of the officer one of the women had been " confined." In this case the keeper was summoned on the 24th of October, 1854, to Bowstreet Police-court, and fined 41., or six weeks' imprisonment. We need not give any details of other cases mentioned in the Report and presenting similar features. It is not to be wondered at that in such dens and holes typhus and smallpox were ever at work, and that moral degradation followed dirt and discomfort. It is said that when the Act was passed there exised places so noisome and pestilential that the officers were more than once made ill by their visits, when they not unfrequently found the entire floor of a room covered thickly with human beings. According to the Report most of this has ceased 'within the last few years, and now the majority of the poor in Londonare decently lodged. How great are the interests involved wil be seen by the number of houses wbich are let out in this way. No less than 14,570 Lodging-house keepers have been served with notices to register, while 6,292 of the houses have been examined and measured to accommodate 91,106 persons. "It is estimated that 103,444 persons wrere "lodged in them at the time of survey." So large a proportion of the population of Loudon is sheltered thus temporarily from night to night. It is probable that not less than a quarter of a million souls retire to sleep nightly in twopenny or sixpenny Lodging-house". For 42,370 of these accommodation has beeni provided in the reered houes. 6,725 houses, or partA of houses, have been given up, and 1,593 are now under supervision. The result of all this energy and labour is stated to be in the highes' degree satisfactory. To the return is added an appendix containing the opinions of a number of medical men connected with the various districts of the capital. The testimony of all these is to the success of the Act in diminishing disease, and, as far as can be observed, crime and immorality. T'his piece of legislation seems, in fact, to have gone to the sonrce of a great evil. However much some may talk of spiritual improvement and moral culture, there can be no doubt of one thinig,-that the bodily state of every man must be the basis of his mental state, and that habitual dirt and raisery will produce demoralization as certainly as an injured brain will produce idiocy or madness. At the bottom of all schemes for the improvement of the people must be placed the elevation of their physical condition. Without this all preaching and schooling are vain; -with it they will soon be demanded by the poor themselves. Health and comfort and general wellbeing urge a man upwards in the scale of morality and decency, but amid crowds, and stencb, and vermin, what place is there for human sympathies, not to say divine aspirations ? The fact that hundreds of thousands throughout the country are being rescued from filth and abasement by the action of one unassuming Act, shows how great a place a politician may attain by pursuing these byways of legislation, even though he should never soar to the regions of constitutional reform or financial organization.
Mr. DIsRAEI has stamped an entirely new question with the character of high national importance. It is so grave, he says, that it must ultimately, and perhaps speedily, be brought to some conclusion by the House of Commons. It does not concern the representation of the people, nor the diplomatic relations of the kingdom, nor the distribution of power between the two great parties, nor the Chinese quarrel, nor the Maynooth Grant, nor Popular Education, nor Church-rates. To none of these subjectsj notwithstanding its moment and its urgency, is it in any degree related. It arises entirely out of the manufacture of Smal Arms for the use of 11M MAJEsrY's forces, and even here is independent altogether of any principle involved in the actual equipment of the troops. The question, in short, is not whether our soldiers shall be armed with new rifles, but 'where and by whom these rifles shall be made. Our readers will recollect that some time ago a Government factory was established at Enfield for the construction of the new weapon, by which it was evident that the regulation musket nint be as soon as possible superseded. This estabelishment, we were assured in the Debate of Friday evening, had not up to March last turned out a single rifle, but it must at any rate have turned out a most influential model, for " the Enfield " rifle"-an improvement on the original Mini&-is now the title of the British weapon half over the world. However, be this as it may, the factory is evidently obnoxious and abominable in the eyes of the Warwickshire gunmakers, and Mr. SPOONER and Mr. NEFWDEGATE conveyed the wrath of their constituents to the ears of Government w.ithout suffering it to lose much in the passage. According to the Birmingham manufacturers, this is an establishment maintained out of the taxes to which they themselves contribute for the purpose of damaging their own position by its " competitive" operation. On the side of the Government it was declared that the factory was not " competitive" in the strict sense of the word; that it served particular ends, as was the case in other departments, and that it was of great utility to the public. We think the last of these arguments will be the safest one to rely upon. It is of no use splitting hairs in attempting to define the precise conditions which would give any establishment a " competitive" character in its relations to another. In substance, the Warwickshire manufacturers are, no doubt, right; indeed, to suppose otherwise would simply be to assume that the wearer cannot tell where the shoe pinches. If the good folks of Birmingham did not feel the pressure they would certainly not complain of it. Lord PAIMERSTON argued that to prove competition it would be necessary to consider the Eafield establishment as working against private factories for the sake of better profits, just as opposition shops do. This, of course, is not the case; but, although theEnfield people mayhave no design of underselling the Birmingham makers in open market, the latter are undoubtedly kept dov n in their terms and up in their -.ork through the instrumentality of the former, and this is pretty much the essence of competition. At Enfield the Government authorities can not only investigate with patience and accuracy every successive improvement suggested in the construction of the rifle, but can determine by their own productions the proper standard of quality and the fair amount of price. The result furnishes an effective cneck upon the price and quality rulina in other markets, andtheproducers for these markets are proportionately incensed at an annoyance createdas they urge by way of gravamen-out of the taxes contributed from their own pockets to the service of the State. Moreover, the Government factory is certainly intended to' turn out rifles, and, we should hope, in considerable numbers; it would also, as a matter of course, be appealed to in the first instance for any supplies that were needed, so that, if there were not a great many rifles required at once, this national shop might monopolize the best part of the custom, and take away so much trade from the old manufacturing districts. We do not see, therefore, how it can be denied that the Enfield factory does operate as a " comcc petitive"' establishment in most of the essentials of competition. If it were not for this factory the Birmingham gunsmiths would certainly have more guns to make, and would probably be able to make them at a somewhat less expense and a somnewhat greater profit. But to admit this much is not to admit that the manufacturers in question are entitled to these advantages, or that there is any error of policy in the establishment at Enfield. On the contrary, it appears to result directly from the arguments employed that 'the publio service gains materially by ,the arrangement, since, in so far as' the Army is supplied from the open trade market, it is supplied better and more cheaply; and, as <Mr.' DI)Oumom tersely remarked, " There was one thing which was even "more important than commercial and economical "principles, and that was that the country should "be supplied with the best article." Neither have the manufacturers themselves any true ground of complaint respecting the employment of public money for the purposes referred to. It is not as gunmakers, but simply as citizens, that they contribute to the Imperial Exchequer, and as citizens they have a commnon interest with all other classes in the objects proposed. If the Enfield factory has really the effect of cheapening the annual vote for ".Small Arms," the country at large gets the benefit, and. taxea will be so much ]ighter in Birmingham, as well as everywhere else. The duty of Government is to consider the advantage of the whole nation, not of any particular class, and when all classes' thus forego their particular interests the aggregate gain becomes the property. of the entire community. All this is so very plain and rudimentary that it scardely res -propounding, but' Mr. .DiazRA and Ids friends unay undoubtedly quir it to be shown that the conditions on which the, argumnent is based are actually fulfilled-in other words, that the Enfield factory can really take the lead and set the example in the construction of first-rate articles at low prices. Lord PAxasrodelivered certain doctrines upon this point in very comprehensive terms. " It was a "mistake," he said, "to suppose that public " works of this description were conducted on so "expensive a plan as to make the articles pro"duced more expensive than could be purchased "from the private trader. Take, for example, "Lancaster shells. He had seen at Woolwich "the manufacture of those sheUs, and he found "that they were not only better than those "supplied by the trade, but that they "were manufactured at about one-third of the price. So it would be in all t1hings." If this is the fact we can only say that " all things" ought to be supplied from Government establisiments; but we confess to considerable doubts in the matter, and suspect that his Lordship took safer ground when he described the advantages of Enfield as consisting in a good " standard of quality" and a certain amount of supply. The sum total of the expenditare upon the Enfield factory is presently to be printed nder a single heading, and then, perhaps, we can arrive at a more accurate estimate on this point; but, though Government works may possess superiority in particular respects, they are not usuaDy distinguished for economy. It was said, with perfect truth, that if the Enfield factory was a competitive establishment as regarded the Birmingham houses, so the national dockyards would be competitive establishments as regarded the shipbuilding trade; but, though Portsmouth and Plymouth may turn out better men-of-war than the yards on the Thames or the Clyde, we doubt if they have much to show on the score of frugality or thrift. In fact, it would be rather difficult in a Government establishment so to bring every outlay to book as to get at a true result. To make a long story short, we believe that if all the expenses of the Enfield establishmeent from its verybeginning werefairly reckoned, andcharged, as they should be, to the account of the weapons now producible from the factory, it -would not be found that the Enfield rifle was exactly a cheap article, or so cheap, in fact, as might have been procured by open contract at first. But we believe also that the pattern at length approved is of a superior quality, and that the standard thus obtained is decidedly higher than it would otherwise have been. Very possibly, too, if the cost of machinery and experiments bs set aside as incurred and satisfied once and for all, the actual weapon may now be turned out at less expense than would be involved in a pzivate factory where no such capital had beesn sunk, and, as a matter of course, the country may as well get the benefit of these facilities, as far as practicable. As a general rule, private enterpre is better than Govermment undertakings, but there are some cases where the infallibiy of supply and the absolute certainty of excellence are of such importance as to counterbalance extraordinary expenditure. Among these eases the manufacture of Small Arms for the use of our troops may deserve in some degree to be reckoned, but the experience of the last few years shows that anything like pressure will inevitably distribute the demand, not only over all Enland, but over foreign countries too.

| TEBE BBELAIAN UTRAMONTAArFS. TO THE :EDI)TOR OF TIME IRIES. Sir,-Amid the din and bustle of your general elections events have occurred in Belgium whih, though hitherto disre.garded in England, are calcalatedto exercise a momentons influence on the future of that country. hn order that your readirs may understand the nature of the present cisis let me recur for a moment to the occuiences of 1848. Prior to the French Revolution of February parties were pretty equally balanced in the Belgiau Legislative Assembly, the Liberals samd Ultramontanes having alternately a small majority, rarely exceeding six or eight. The Revolution found Bel- gium in po-session of a Liberal Ministry, and,-g thanls to the wrisdom of the King, the prudence of the Government, and the lovalty of the people, the country passed safely through the storm whicL levelled nearly every other continental Government. Then came the reaction in France and elsewhere-a, reaction of 'which the Ultramontane part was not -low to.avail itself. The franchise being en a most extended scale, the great majority of voten in the villages and country districts, more partiealrly in the Flemish provinces, are profouLdly ignorant and completely under the domination of the priests. Called on to exercise the elective franchise they are driTen by the ctre- in locks, hlke sheep, to the pol in the full belief that Liberals, Freemasons, and A theists are synonomousterms, for so are thev taught bebdomad211y. Theintelligentpopulationsof Brussehl, Antwerp, Lidge, and Verviera have struggle in vain against this priestly domination, and aom'two or three years ago the Ultramontane party obtained a decided majority in the Legislative Assembly The King,whothorougblunderstands his position as a constitutional monarch, was compelled to form a Government the opinions of which were il accordance with those of the Parliamentary majority. The Liberal ministry was dismtssed, and that of ML de Decker, a mere tool of the priests, appointed in its place. No sooner was this triumph gained than intolerance and bigotry assumed new developments. The most able organs of the press protested in vain. The bisbops replied by excommunicating their readers- Pastoral letters were issued warming parents of the fate which awaited those who did not patronize the Jesuit College of Louvain, and the State Universities of Ghent and Liege were put under episcopal ban. At length the pear seemed ripe, and about to months back the Government introduced the Bill upon Charitable Institutions, whieh was the immediate cause of last weekls riotiNg. The administration of charity in Belgium since lS30 has been completely secularized and concentrated inthe hands of the civil power. Religiouscongregations and members of the clergy of every denomunation are legally incapable of receiving or distributi'g alms and bequests destined for tbe poor. This distribution is madeby two institutionsspeciallappointed for the purpose-the Admrnistratio,fs BereliEres and the Buz-enux de Bwifaisawe. Ali bequests to religious congregations are null ancd void, and all donations in favour of the poor are rermitted to the abovenamed institutions. It will thus be seen that Belgium enjoys a lawn more limited in its application thau our Law of Mortmain, bat still affording a protection against the priest to the dying citizen and his family. The Mlinisterial Bill proposes that the C-overbmeat shall have the power, by a simple dectee under the King's hand, of conferring on religious congregations the rights of citizens, with all the privileges attaching thereto, including those of possessing, inheriting, and receiving all donations and legacks. given or bequeathed to them. On t.he other hand, hey who nwish to dispose of their fortune in favourw of the poor, or for charitable purpcoses, wvill have the right to name special administrators of such property as t.hey shall devote to that end. In fact, the proposed Bill practically repeals the eisting laws, a-d withdrawrs all protection from the dying man, whom it leaves in the hands and at the mercy of his spiritual attendant. But, this is not all. It is fraught with danger to the CrQwn, for a family disinhernted in favour of a convent will bear no goodvill towards the Kang who has signed the decree. whereby that convent is rendered capable of inheriting, and whereby they are ruined. "1 Wlre have liberty of speech," say the blinisters and the priests,"libertyof the press,liberty of meeting; let us, then, have liberty of charity " However, the Bill was brought in, and the discussions were regarded with the greatest anxiety by the public, who crowded the Tribunes laily. The uebates lasted upwards of a month, and on the 19th ult. the principle of the bill was aneimed bya majority of 60 to 44, one member dedining to vote, and five only beiug absent. A noble stand was made during the whole discussion by Messrs. Rogier, Verhaegen, Orts, Tesch, and F?re-rban, who fought the ground inch by inch, shivered the feeble arguments of their opponents, and were beaten only by force of numbers. The principle of the Bill being carried the Opposition proposed amendment after amendment. Contimuay defeated, they were ever at their post, supported by the great mass of the country's intelligence. The applause wherewith their speeches -were greeted from the tribunes roused the ire of the Ministerialists, who declared that the Assembly was deliberating under du;resse, ancd three times during the debates were the tribunes cleared by force. At length, on Weduesday last., ML Frere-Orban, having declared that the Government were playing an " ifadigno canmdie" before the Chamber and the country, was called ito order by the President. He at once replied by accsing the IPrsident of partiality, the word " infamre" having been applied to himn by a member on a previous occasion, and pasmed uncensured hby the President. This sally was reasived with i7tmense applause in the tribunes, and the President ordered them to boe cleared forth"with. Amid the groans asd yells of the occupants this task waa slowly effected by the gendarmes. The crowd thi rushed outside the Chamber and kooted the P Ae'B Nuncio. They yelled at the Ministers, cheered the Opposition members, and in t'e evening paraded the town in groups of 50 or 60. Next evening they broke the windows of the FEmancipoiit ofice, a journal specially devoted to the priest panty, and likewise those of the Jesuita and other xeligious establishments. The troops were kept in readiness, artillery was stationed on fie. Grande Pisee, and great excitement prevailed. On Friday to Burgomaster issued a -proclamation forbidding groups of more than fiveto assemble, and in the evening the mounted genda2mes diapensedsaoserwhoedeavoured to evade its effect. Yesterday the King published a decree pro.roguing the CShumber sinle t6,, and, in all probability, t~he lMiiiistaria Bill -s beard of no more. Meanwhile riots hn.ve occurred at Mons and at Antwerp, at Ghent, ;nd at LiAget. Tlhe old spirit is roused among the 'veerhers, nxai they seem deter!mined to resist any further aJaS t at prieest domination. -The resolution 3dopb by the Ling Js Egte wiest that could be tahke, under the- cir;istances It will probably rwsDor peae and o04m, by giv.ing the G4overn mentazospotnty of qtlylt4 *,dropping their4obnoxioususeasre writhout tO- ap. i pesance of yia£diug to pmal,liocamour.

TBR WEST INDIA, MBXrAY, AND PACIFIC MAILS (BY RLE=rRIC AND INTERNiATIONAL THLEGRATE.) SOUTHAMPTON, MONDAY NIGHT. The Royal Mail Company's steamship Paramn, sCaptain Bevis, has arrived with the West India, .iexican, and Pacific mails, aud dates from Vera ,Cruz to May 6(; Havannah, 10th; Greytown, 6tn; -Jamaica, 12th; Porto Rico, 16th; Demerara, 10Oh; Grenada, 11th; Trinidad, 11th ; Barbadoes, 12th; St. Vincents, lth; Antigua, 12th; Colon, 9th; Carthagena, 11th; Tobago, lOth ; and St. Thomas's, 17th. This steamer brings 297 passengers, and on freight -specie, value $3,161,860, and pearls, value $4,35o. Hier cargo inclides 69 serons cochiueal, 469 serons 'bark, 55 sorons jalap, 140 cases cigars, 386 bales -tobacco, 33 casks coffee, 49 bales satparilla, 78 bags cocoa, 48 packages vanilla, and 175 packages -nmudries. The squadron was leaving Carthagena when the -Dee arrived. Her Majesty's ships Arachne and Falcon were at Vera Cruz. Yellow fever is again appearing at St. Thomas's, and there have been a few cases among the Royal mail steamers stationed intercolonially. The Parana *on her homeward voyage has also suffered from yellow fever, and a few cases have terminated fatally. Lieutenant Pearson, R.N., expired'on board ,on the 23d of May of disease of the heart. M. de La Massue, passenger from Martinique, died from rup-ture of a bloodvessel on the 22d of May. At Barbadoes the Road Bill had passed the Coluncil. Mlr. James Walker had left for St. Vincent's toundertake the administrationof the Governinent there. Crop operations were not so forward as they '4ought to be on account of irregular winds. Great -activity prevailed in the produce markets. Sugar -and molasses were greatly in demand, and prices had advanced. Latest quotations were, sugars, $7J to 17i per 1001b. ; molasses, 40c. to 41c. the gallon. The stock of breadstuffs on hand had larggely increased, and the depression in the market consequently continued. The health of the island was ,generally good. There wau a lull in local politics at Grenada. The sugar crop proceeded with uninterrupted success, mnd the canes were yielding satisfactorily. A shock of earthquake was felt for about 30 seconds on the -30th of April, which, with distant thunder, drizzling 3ra;n and other symptoms, indicated an approaching ~change of weather. The health of the island was .good. From Trinidad we have favourable accounts of sugar-making. The weather had been of the best, -and the canes were yielding a fair quantity of very sweet juice. The crop was nearly taken off all over the country. A shock of earthquake was felt on the same day as at Grenada. The young canes were springing satisfactorily. A favourable change of weather had taken place at St. Lucia. The bark Enterprise sailed for London on the 4th of May -with produce. Her Majesty's brig of war Atalanta arrived on the 4th on a cruise, and sailed again on *the 6th. From Jamaica dates are to the 12th of May. The Africans captured by Her Majesty's ship Arab had not yet been distributed; the Jamaica Depcatc)b -of the 11th says:- "W We have it nowv pretty accurately ascertained that the -slave trade between the coast of Africa and Caba involves the export from Africa annually of from 40,000 to 50,000 slaves, of whom about 30,000 reach their destination alive. It is clear that the preventive service on the West Coast Is wholly unequal to the suppres. -sion of this trade. The extenslve seaboard, the numberless creeks and rivers which characterize the African coast, and the watchfulness of the parties engaged in the -trade, combine to render any attempt at effectual suppression wholly impracticable in that direction. If the trade is to be put dowvn- that is to say, if the British Government b he reaUy desirous of permanently suppressing the tra'iothe most effectual mode of doing so would be to remove the blockade from the African coast and to station -it on the coast of Caba. The slave trade with Brazil was .put down not by the African squadron, but by the rigid blockade of the few Brazilian ports at which alone the illicit cargoes could be landed. It would need a larger squadron to effect the same object in Cuba, but the end is equally attainable by the same means. At present and for -many years there has been, in fact, no preventive service whatever on the coast of Cuba. A few of the seven or eight vessels of war on this station have occasionally, nio d,,ubt, when not otherwise occupied, or when informationi has been received of an expected slaver, been ordered to cruise off the east end of Cuba in the hope of pickinig up a prize; -but no vessels whatever have been specifically allotted to this important service, nor has -there been any constant effort made to intercept a trade which for a munltitude of reasons is the most watchful in the world. What we would suggest is, that half,-dozen small steamners of light draught-sailing vessels are not adapted to the service-should be specially devoted by the Acdmiralty for the suppression of the slave trade on the coast of Cuba. For this purpose coaling dep6ts should be established at tho most accessible ports of the north side of Jamaica, where the steamers can also provision and water from time to time as may be requisite. Ports Antonio and Lucca are probably the best places that could be -selected for such a purpose, and,if three small steamers were stationed at these ports, two might be constantly at sea, while the third was taking in coals, water, and provisions. If these vessels wore on the constant look-out off the east end and along the south-eastern coast of Cuba, we venture to say that three out of every four cargoes of slaves destined for -that island would be captured." The weather was variable ; dry in some parts of the island and sliowery in others. A smart shock of earthquake was felt on the 10th. The Tamaica Despatch says,- "All the veesels of war at Greytown, with the exception of Her Majesty's ship Orion, had been ordered home The Orion remain on the station. We presune the difficulties with the new Grenadian Government have been satisfactorily anranged." Exchanges on London at Jamaica and colonial banks were quoted-90 days, i per cent. pm.; 60 -days, I per cent. pm.; 30 days, 1J per cent. pm.; private bills, par on New York; merchants' bills, 1J per cent. pm. Ordinary quality of coffee was worth 45s. per 1001b. Sales of flour at 38s. to 39s. per barrel, but held at 40s. No mess pork at market; prime mess .-held at 105s. Iice sales at 13s. 6d. Prices of rum had advanced. Pacific files of papers have not come to hand. There has been a great discovery of gold at Upata, in the province of Venezuela. The gold is ex-ceedingly pure, and the quantities realized are beyond belief. Two miners discovered iD one day 34 ounces. The gold found is principally in large sauggets of from 4 to 5 ounces.

INA UGURATIOY OF CALTHORPE-PARK AT BIRMINGHA . Yesterday was a great gpla day at Birmingham, for hIs PBoyal Hlighness the Duke of Cambridge, attended by a large party of distinguished viitors, inaugurated Lord Calthorpe's gift of a free park to the people of that borough. There are few, if any, of our great manufacturing towns which stand more in need of the gift of a park than Birmingham -the metropolis of labour, where smoke is indigenous and all vegetation exotic and rar. A short time since Mr. Adderley, XiP., mado the borough a present of about 30 acres of ground, situated tt the north side of the town. His was the first step towards ventilating the grimy manufacturing centre, vrith its streets of clanging workshops and firmament of smoko, amid which even 'he innumerable chimney tops are lost in obscusity. The example has been followed by Lo?d Calthorpe, wh.o in furnishing the townv with i. *w lung on the south side has outdone even n. Adderley. The piece of ground which his Lordship has presented, though not larger than the first gift, is on the whole a better piece of land, and one which, from its local position, is more likely to be popular and frequented. To the gift is attached a condition which none can object to-namely, if the park be not used by the people after a fair lapse of time the pro. perty will reaain under his Lordship's control; if, on the other hand, it become, as it undoubtedly wiU become, a source of amusement and healthful recreation to the towns. people, the land will be the property of the borough totally and for evermore. It was to inaugurate this liberal gift that the Dake of Cambridge visited the hardware metropolis yesterday, and went through a ceremony which has long been looked forward to by the townspeople, and which may now be remembered by them with feelings of unmixed satis. faction and pride. The day was observed as a strict holyday, not only in Birmingham, bat in the districts immediately around it; the weather was thoroughly favourable, and the whole ftte was one of uninterrupted enjoyment and success. As far as we could ascertain not a single accidert or contretemps occurred to diminish the fdnat with which it paesed off. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge arrived at the Snow-hil station of the Great Western Railway shortly after 12 o'clock. The interior of the terminus was decorated with considerable taste with evergreens, flowers, and banners; the platform was carpeted; and the refreshment rooms at either end were almost concealed under a profusion of wreaths and garlands, so that the whole effect was most striking. The Mayor of Birmingham (Mr. Rateliff), the ex-mayor, and senior aldermen of the corporation, were in waiting to receive his Royal Highness. There were also on the platform the Earl of Sihaftesbury, Lord Calthorpe, Lieutenaut-General Sir Harry Smith, Colonel Wilkie, Captain Rainey, Colonel Bamford, the Bishop of Worcestse, Colonel Gordon, R.E., Mr. Adderley, hLP., Mr. Newdegate, hLP., the Hon. and Rev. G. M. Yorke, Rural Dean, Mr. C. E. Bracebridge, and nearly 200 ladies and gentlemen, who were anxious to be among the first to welcome the Duke to Birmingham. On alighting his Royal Highness immediately pro'ceeded to an apartment which had been handsomely fitted up for his reception, where he changed his ordinary travelling dress for the full uniform of a GeneraL Colonel Tyrwhitt and Colonel Clifton, who were in attendance upon his Highness, also availed themselves of the opportunity to assume their respective uniforms. Immediately afterwards the Dake entered the Mayor's carriage, and, the members of the corporation, with the visitors, having also taken their different seats, the corttge moved slowly towards the Town-hael, escorted by a troop of the 10th Hussars. From as early as 9 o'clock in the morning the crowd had begun to assemble around the station, and by the time the Duke had arrived the concourse of spectators was far greater and more dense than on the occasion of the visit of Prince Alberb in 1855. The extreme fineness of the weather and it being Whit-Monday, and therefore a' holyday in Birmingham, will account for the immense number of spectators, though neither of these causes could have had much to do with the intense enthusiasm which was manifested as his Royal Highness issued from the terminus, and, indeed, throughout his route. The cheers were loud and incessant, and windows and housetops seemed in a perfect flutter of waving handerchiefs. Every house was crowded inside with groups of eager, hearty people, and outside with flags, banners, and pennants, till the ordinarily rather dark-coloured aspect of Birmingham edifices was quite conoealed under all the hues of the rainbow. The procession passed throagh Bull-street and High-street into New-street, and here the decorations were on such a scale as to defy description. Arches, garlands, wreaths, flags, trophies, andtransparencies met the eye in every direction. There is no town in the kingdom that displays such spirit in public decorations of all iinds, but yesterday Birmingham quite outdid itself. The flagsliterally covered the buildings, and in some parts the streets also, for they were stretched across the roads in large festoons from house to house, reaching almost to the ground. The sight of so many banners, of every hue and form, with the crowds of people cheering and waving hats and handkerchiefs, gave to the whole scene along the line of procession an appearance that was gay and beautiful in the extreme. Some of the displays, especially outside the larger firms, must have been most costly, and all were more or less appropriate. Hero and there of course were instances in which anxiety to produce an effective banner led to slight trespasses on what may be callecl international heraldry, and some buntings, on which the ambitious decorator had attempted to portray in one the flags of the four late allied Powers, wero singularly whimsical in their appearance, and unlike any standard that was, is now, or ever will be. So also now and then the Royal arms were quartered in a way that would have made the Heralds Colltgo shudder and been as blighting as Meda's head to Garter, York, or Clarencieus. One or two transparencies, too, were rather more noteworthy for orignality of desiga than skiU in exeoution, and attempts to portray his Royal Highness on horseback seemed ivariably to result in a kind of centaur in uniform, all hoofs in the air and smoke in the bhack. ground. But with these few exceptions, which, however, were by no mneaHs among the least striking of the many, the general effect was rich and glowing, and would have reflected credit on the first city of the kingdom. The procession arrivedat the Town-hall soon after 1 o'clock. In front of this fine building a detachment of the 10th Hussars was drawn up, with a squadron of the Warwilckshire Yeomanry, to keep the ground clear. In discharging this duty they found ample ocoupation for all their energies, for, though the people were most orderly and good-tempered, there was an immense crowd, which could scarcely find room within the prescribed rather limited boundaries. On arriving at the building his Royal Highness was conducted to the committee-room, where, in company with the Mayor, Sir Harry Smith, and one or two ef the principal visitors, he partook of luncheon. The repast concluded, the Duke was conducted back to the hall, which had its fine architectural beauties well set off with light and appropriate decoration. The side gaUeries were crowded with ladies and gentlemen, who gave a most warm and flattering reception to the Royal Duke as he walked to the dais erected at the upper end of the hall.

This reply was received with continued applause, which was renewed several times. An address was next presented by Lord Hatherton from the council of the Midland Institute, which was succeeded by one fron the military arms trade of Birmingham, presented by Mr. J. D. Goodman. The latter vwa as follows " lay it p'esee sour Royal Highness, On behalf of the miltary arms trade of Birmingham, I tender so your Royal Hioheesa the expreosion of our lively sense of the disetcgulsed honour conferred on the town by lour aupidous vit, iu whicb Xve graterally recogr.ze a kindly interest in the progress and well4teig of the manufacturing community of this midland metropolis.

" Sisned by the authority and on behalf of the Birmingham Smual Arms Manufacturers. "B irmingham, .Tune l. 1857." "J. D. GOODMAN, Caairman.' The Rev. Dr. Badham having also presented an aAdress from the masters of the proprietary school, and Mr. P. HoUins one from the Society of Artists, which werereceivei by his Royal Highness, the proceedings in the hail terminated with the National Anthem, which was sung by a number of children in the orchestra with good taste and really fine efifet. His Royal Highness, with the Mayor and the whole of the noblemen and gentlemen who had taken part in the proceed. ings then entered their carriages, and the procession moved slowly towards Calthorpe-park. The route traversed the greater part of one side of Birmingham, passing through New.-street, the Bull-ring, Digbeth, Smithfield-bars, Broomsgrove-street, Bristol-street, Bristol-road, and Speed. well-road; and alon, this line of two miles length his Royal Highness met with a continued ovation. Except upon the narrow space reserved for the procession all the road a'nd footway was thronged with thousands, who gave vent to such vociferous loyalty as to make one's ears ring again. Many of these streets lay through what may be called the poorer parts of Birmingham, but though the class of decorations showed a falling off, there was decidedly none whatever in their number. Literaly none seemed so poor as to be without a device of some kind-widely differing in character, though much the same in general effect. One house showed a monstrous hide, to which coloured ribands in vain strove to give a festive aspect, as it moved stifly to and fro like a dead bull. Its appearance was by no means aided by a pair of jackboots, inscribed with a motto, conveying delicately to his Highness the intimation that there was nothing like leather-a sentiment that seemed warmly appreoiated by the crowd, in spite of the dou bts which might have beeet their minds as to its present application. Near to this was a more pretentious banner, which, in addition to its material charms, had enlisted the grace of poetry. On it was worked in large letters- *Welcome brave warior! -whine valeor none surpased: "Who fougt hisn country's battles, "And has come to Brum at last" A little below this his Royal Highness, by a tender orthogra. phical mistake,washailed as "TheRoyalDuck." There were, of comuse, no end of "Cambridges for ever!" "The Dulke !" "1 Inkermann's Hero !" &c., mixed with laurels, evergreens, andwreatbsof immortelles. At every little streetorlane from which aview of everything butthe procession could be gained vague combinations of timber were thrown together, on which bystanders were ontreated to risk their lives at sums v.rying from 2d. upwards. Nevertheless, though nothing was to be seen from them, they seemed to let well, and would, we doubt not, have done s till better but that among the mnltitude discretion not only got the better of valour, but even of curiosity. All the win dows of the little housei were densely thronged, and even the few who could make no display with flags in varied calicoes, at least had boughs of trees, with ragged and very parti-coloured urchins seated along the ledges of the shop fronts. A little after 3 o'clock the corMgearrived at Calthorpe-park. It is a fine and level piece of ground of about 30 acres in extent, with a neat, smooth turf, crossed here and there with gravel walks. One side of it is bounded by the river Rea, which here at leash is a clear brisk stream and as unlike its lower portion near Birmingham as the Thames is unlike pure water. As a whole the ground is admirably adapted for a people's park, and, above all, as a place for manly, healthful recreation. May the people of Birmingham a ppreciate the gift as it deserves, and may Calthorpe-park long fulfil the purpose for which it was given, that of sweetening and enhancing th5 few leisure hours which fall to the lot of one of the most numerous and hardly worked townspeople in the kingdom. Yesterday the park was literally covered with a dense crowd of spectators, wvho, of course, made sad havoo on its hitherto well-kept turf. It is computed that between 60,000 and 70,000 rsons were in it when the Dake arrived. As is Poyal Highness entered the nark a salute was fired by a company of artillery, and the sound of the guns was responded to by deafening cheers. His Royal Highness proceeded at once to a large marquee which was erected for the accommodation of himself and the more distinguiLhed visitors. Here the ceremony of inaugurating the [park was gone through. We believe that when the programme was first arranged there was some little dif'dculty experienced in deciding upon the exact nature of the ceremony by which the inauguration should be effected. It was at length determined, as the most appropriate, that his Royal Highness, with Lord Calthorpe and the Mayor of the town, should each plant a tree. Three pretty little treos were accordingly placed near to the pavilion and the holes in which henceforth we hope they may grow and flourish. Tho ceremonial gardening was duly gone through, and the trees, meek-looking httle vegetablea with hard names, were replaced in their mother earth, tucked in with a shovel, and Calthorpe-park was inaungurated. HisRoyAL HIGQNYrSS then said,-" My Lord Calthorpe, Mr.Mayor, and Gentlemen,-I have the honour to announce that thas park is now opened for the use of the public." Games and sport s were to have followed the inauguration, but thepark was, we believe, much too crowded to permit of such an arrangement being carried out. At all events, the only athletic feats displayed were by those anxious to extricate tbemaselves fron themob as SOOn as posaible. Th,ceremony over, hia Royal Hitghness proceeded direct toWydrludton. the residence of the Mayor. 6ear Edlgbaston church a very bandsome triumphal arch was erected, similar in taste and beauty of design to thoge nuderwhich theprocession passed on entering the park. By the side of the arch the school children were drawnt up to welcomoe isa Royal Ei"hness. In the evening the Dake was entertained by the Mhyorat a magnificent banquet at Dee's Hotel, where 220 guests sat down to dinner. WVith a kindly desire that all classes should participate in the festivities of the day the Mayer also gave a free concert in the evening at the Town-hall, and a free ball took place at the Musio hall under the management of the ayor's Committee of rangement. The entire expenses of all these entertinments were defrayed by the Mayor himi. self. To-morrow the Duke will yiait the chief manufactures of Birmingham, and, after partaking of an almost public luncheon, will return to London in the evening.

H3 T IITEIOTN -t ART.TRASURs. Manchester is faull of visitors, who have come to Fpend the Whitsuntida. holydays there, the excursion trains which arrived on Saturday night and 11 qnday having mostly crowds of passengers ia themn. One of thesetrains, from London, consisteI of upwards of 30 carriages, and the trains from Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, and Sheffield brou,ght immense numbers. There were very fulltrains also from Yorkshire and the populous towns of Lancashire. The exhibition, however, has not been so crowded as might have been expected. The number that had paid the shilling admission up to 3 o'clock was about 8,000,which is a considerable increaseuponanypreviousday,thoughshortofwhathad been anticipated. The building waa at no time much more crowded than on previous days, season ticketholders having probably kept away to a great extent from, the fear of a crush, while many of the shilling visitors remaining only one to two hours in the exhibition, there was rather a succession of crowda than a great accumulation of people at any ene period of the day. This was probably owing to the limited time visitors had to spend in Manchester, and the many other attractions offering themselves in various parts of the town. The weatber was extremely fine and inviting, so that every part of the town presented a busy, gay, and animated appearance throughout the day. The only cheap trips byrailwvay y'esterday to the Art Treasures apecially wfere one from Crews and one from Shrews bury.___
HAYJAKEBT THEATRE. * Last night a drama, professedly original, but probably based upon some Prenci story, was brought out at this theatre with unequivocal success. It is entitled A Husband for an Hour, and the author is Mr. Falkoner, whose fiveact play, The Cagot, produced at the Lyceum, was one of the notabilities of last winter. The notion of the piece takes place during the reign of Louis XVL, at the time when the prejudices of the old aristocratic system had not been swept away by the revolution. Jalie, the young Countess de Clairville (Miss Reynolds), a reigning beauty, courted by the Mtarquis de Crivecocur (Mr. W. Fasrren), is residing with her mother (Ms. Poynter) at the family chateau in Dauphin&. Robert (Mr. Backstone) the head gardener, harbours an affection for his lovely mistress, but, of course, he keeps his feelings within his own bosom. Evea under liberal Institutions mnarriages between young ladies and their gardeners would not be regarded with a favourable eye, and among the nobility of unrevolutionized France an alliance of the sort would have 'oeen an abomination of the worst kind. However,while the Countesses, old and young, and the accepted Mlarquis, are seated comfortably at breakfast, Le Clerq IMsr. Rogers), a gentleman of the legal professon, pays them a visit and reveals the unsavory trath that Robert is not only a member of the family btut is the rightful owner of the chateau and the estate thereto appertaining, so that the fair Julie is no countems at alL "Prosperity makes friends and adversity tries them," says the old proverb, and accordingly, while R obert, now Count de Clairville is, anxious to forego the honours, which the discovery of his noble birth has thrust upon him, the less magnanimous Marquis astounds the objeot of his adorations, by changing his offer of marriage into proposals less honourable. Anxious for vengeance the lair Julie, now first acquainted wvith the love of Robert, consents to marry him at once, if, as soon as the ceremony is over, he will chaUenge the Marquis. The condition is joyfully acoepted. A chaplain performs the nnatrimonial rite between the refined lady and the loutish Counit; the Marquis is challenged according to contract, and running his adversary through the body leaves him for dead. Three years elapse, but are insufficient to clear the conscience of Juhe. From a mere desire of!revengeshe has sacrificed thelife of a generous and disinterested man, having first cajoled him into marriage without a particle of love, and reflection on this conduct nakes her exceedingly uncomfortable. Hence, while she is at Paris, residing at the hotel of her friend, the Countess d'Aubigny (Miss Ellen Sabine), she will not hear of such a thing as a new lover, and is especiaUy annoyed at the reappearance of the Marquis de Crsvecneur, whose offers, now she has again becomeaCousteas, are once more honoarable. However the attention of Lord Thornley, an Englishman, who shines above aU competition like another Alcibiades, awakens a kind of sympathy, more particularly as he protects her on one occasion from the intrusions of the Marquis, and disarms the latter in single combat. Possibly she might be happy with the noble Briton, but a speculations on this head are suddenly cut sbort by the resuscitation of the deceased Count Robert, who in his old rusticattire shockstheelegant guestsof the Hotel d'Aubigny. Ultimately she is relieved from her embarrassment by the revelation that Lord Thos-nley and Robert are one and the same person, the buulpkin of the first act having so cultivated is min3 during the three years that he becomes the fine gentleman of the second. To accept this plot it is necessar to swallovv the enormoxis improbability tkpt a mere change of dress (without h patch on the eye, or anything of the sort,) will so utterly destroy the identity of an individual that his most intimate friends will not be able to recognize him. However, Mr. Buckstone, who acts the peasant in his usual comic manner, but tames down his humour to represent the accomplished lord, does his best to lessen'thediffliculty, and greatly astonished are the audience to see their favourite comedian act a really sentimental part. Miss Reynolds as the high-born lady, subject to sudden aecesses of rage, and tr. W. Farren, as the cold-blooded seducer of the ancient school, both play exceedingly well, bat none of the characters admit of very forcible colouring or are thro,wn into very striking situations. A comic underplot is formed on the old principle of making the servants imitate the actions of their masters, and perhaps the scene that of aUl others created the niost amusement vwas the one in which Lord Thornley's man (Mr. Crompton), feigning to be a Briton, thrashes the Marquis's valet (Mr. Clarke) with boxing-gloves, while the Countess's maid (Mts. E. Fitzwilliam) jumps with delight upon the sofa at the contemplation of te practical "fun." At the fall of the curtain the applause was unmiversal, and, though the improbability alluded to was not compensated either by ingenuit,y of plot or brillinncy of dialog,ue, the democratic sentimerit that pervaded the wvhole seemed to touch the sympathies of the audience. To-morrow (Wednesday) Miss Reynolds, who bas contributed to the success of so many Haymarket pieces, will take her benefit, and, besides performing the characber of Julie in the new piece, will appear as Kate in Perfectior, the first character that introduced her to the London public.
dADELPHI THEATEB. Mladame Celeste will tqke her benefit to-morrow (Wed. nesday) night, when a new drama, entitled George DarviWe, will be produced.
WmvSUNnDri HOLYDAYS.-The various railway stations in the metronolis were yesterday literally besieged by tbousands of persoss anxious to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the several excursion trains to shake off the dust and bustle of city life and to seek amid the freshness of rural scenes that wholesome relaxation which It is in vain to look for amid the crowded thoro h- fares and the murky atmosphere of London. About 57,000 persons were conveyed by the London and Brighton Railway alone to the Crystal pialace, Croydon, Epsom, and the numerous other points of attraction upon the company's lines. The many public exhibitions of the metropolis also had their due share of visitors. Among others that of Madame Tussaud, in Baker-street ; the Great Globe, in Leicester-squlare; Burfords Panorama; and Mr. Gordon Cumming's Exhibition were numerously attended. ANGLO-bDIAN VIEW OF THE PBACE WITH PERSIA. -It is reported that a portion of our troops will be immediately withdrawn from Persia, hut we trust the rumour is without foundation. Not a single soldier should leave the shores of the Gulf until every condition of the treaty just signed at Paris has been ratified. Naturally base, and guided by the counspls of the unsecrupulous agents of the Czar, the Court of Teheran would have no scruple in violating the laws of nations, and seizing upon any opportunity which accident or good faith on ouI part might offer. The present Shah, we understand, is capricious and intractable to a degree, and it is not only possible, but extremely probable, that he-will refuse to ratify the treaty which has 3ust been signed in Paris. It is well known that Russia was under the impression that Ferak Khan might have secured much better terms, and the agents of the inmbassy, both in Paris and London, endeavoured as much as. lay in their power, to influence the envoy. Should the Shab, therefore, receive a hint from St. Petersbusg to temporize and not ratify the treaty, he will not hesitate for a moment about carrying on the war; or, at all events, retain possession of Heratfor a time, until he can show to tle rude nations -of Central Asia thit the,British hive been apparently driven f*om his shores and tbat the real object of the-war-the "key of India"-is still hanging at his girdle. It-would thereforebe little short of-insaaity to withdraw troops from Persi&at the present ovials. Although an armistice has been concluded, the war is not over. Already we have humbled Persia too mucb, but we hhve lost instead ot gained by the proceeding. We have coneietid her into an implaeable foe, which sceacely any concessions wil ever conciliate. Bushire and Karrack arm so be restered to the enemy, and at th2. very moment when our troops, flushed with victory, were ready to marcE upon the Shah's richest cities, ttesword is orsdered to be sheathed, and the defeated and dEs. organized arnies of the enemy allowed time to strengeun and recruit themsel-ee, so that they maybe enabled tocaTry on another campaign on the opening of the 5euaon. Whatever we gain by the sword we lose in diplomv ay. Thstreaty just concluded is quite on a level with tho n,,gotlativawbiu; rought the Oriasean war to a conclusion at the very noment when our victorious armies could have marched into the very heart of -the Russianempire withr,ut let or hindrance.

.I -I T -C . i ~ ~ FL RIO- . TATTERBSALIS. MoNDAv As usual, ordy a partl settlement of the Epson bets was efiected this afternoon. To-morrow, however, is, in accordance with custom,n the day for the final cdosing of accounts. The expectations of an mnsaSFtory Derby settling are likely to be most agreeably disappointed; money changed hands with a frequency which indicated extraor. dinary confidence, and certainly, so far as the Monday is concerned, "the winding-up act" on no former occasion worked so effectually. Even those persons whoseabssncewaihintedatas more than probable were amongthe fir to show, and many others who were reported severely "hit" evinoed, by the readiness to meet their liabilities, that they would on the Lst day be quite prepared to face their creditors. To prove the extent to which the settling vwas carried to-day, we may state that M. Davis, with that promptitude to dischuge all claims upon him for which he has ever been distinguished, entered the room with 20,000. in his pocket and qtitted it with 15 sovereigns ! . The debts of a Susser gentleman were bought up at Ts. 6d. and lOs in the pound, and those who know the trae state of his accounts entertain no fears of his being enabled, -vi& a little tiue, to settle in full Remarks of too confident a nature would, however, be premature until after to-morrow. I Time was so occupied by the comparing and settling of passed acounts that scarcely an opportunity was afforded for opening new ones. For the Ascot Cup 5 to 1 would have been taken freely abouttance. 600 to 100 was bookled about Skirlisher; and 8 to L, to 501., about Gemma di Vergy. KSxT A2D THE£ aEWARsr STAsrs, We have the authority of Admiral Eons for stating that Sent was declared not to start for the Newmarket Stakes at 20 minutes before the first race of the day, which was seo fcr 1 o'clock. T3-3 WLr,'xa or TFE DERBY. Blnk Bonny is a bay mare, atstding 15 hands 23 inches high, has a very neat lean head, rather wide ears, sud good length of neck; is very deep in the girth, and possesses beautiful oblique shoulders, immense ribs, powerful quarters, drooping a little towards the tail, which is a thin " switch, with very strong thighs, great bone, and large hocks and knees. She has a white blaze in the face running down towards the nose,and one white fore fetlock joint. Bertemperis remarkably docie, and her appearance generally conveys the idea of carrying with esse a great weight to hounds. All sorts of insinuations were thrown out respecting Blink Bonny during the winter, and her fluctuations in the betting at " the Corner" gave rise to the belief that she wms a "safe 'on." The true cause, however, we are assured by her owner, was an attack of fever, brought on by the mare cutting her teeth. After Doncaster, where she was known to be a little "off, " Blink Bonny began to thrive wonderfully, and Mr. IAnson left her as well as possible (under the care of his son Roobert, who has always looked after her, and on most occasions ridden her in public) when he started to the Liverpool Autumn Meeting last November, but on his return from Shrewsbury he found her amiss, and since that period she had been regularzy attended by two veterinary surgeons. Previous to being brought out at Newsmarket she could scarcely eat her corn, and, as a n atter of course, was in a thoroughly weak state ; bat, uishiingto keep faith with thepublic, and thinking her good enough to win the Thousand, even in that condition, Mr. 1'Anson started the mare-with what result our readers are vell acquainted. Since then ner teeth have been rasped twice, and she b as fed and done much better, but even no w cannot mnasticate a feed of corn without considerable ditticulty-BeWs Life.

The order of the symphonies should have been reversed not merely for the sake of avoiding an anachronism, bat because the effect would have been better. The first part was composed entirely of modern music; while in the second the only classicalpiece was Mozart's, which had thus to stand the test, both of what went before and what followed. The symphony in E flat (one of a series of three-the other two being the G minor and the so-called Jupiter-written within the space of a month) was intended for a limited orchestra. It was therefore impolitic to place it after such elaborately i.sstrumented pieces as the svmphony of Beethoven and the violin concerto of Mendelssjhn. Happily, however, genius is privileged, and such an audience of genuine amateurs as mually ssembilesat the Philharmonic concerts would hirdly, under any circumstances, be insensible to the exquisite beauties of Mozart. The symphony in E flat-finely executed from first to last, and with the orthodox indication of the times of each movement for which ProfessorBennett isdistinguished-wasthoroughly enjoyed; but it would, there is reason to believe, have beenheard withstillgreaterinterest at the beginning of the programme. If a convincing proof had been wanting of therecent progress of the Philharmonic band, the Pastoral Symphony wonld hare satisfied the most exacting connoisseur. We do not remember to have heard it played with greater clearness and precision. Both of these great works were listened to with undiminished attention and delight. 'The overture entitled Tie lVsiades is wel known to all who are familiar with the best instrumental compositions of the English school, though it is little to our credit that Slike other productions of the same pen) it should be much more frequently heard in Germany than here. TJhe Naiades (written upwards of 20 years ago-long before its composer dreamed of becoming "Doctor in Music," or professor at the University of Cambridge], besides being a work of cbarming fancy, is an example of ingenious contrivance fully deserving the epithet of masterly. It is something for the Philharmonic Society to be able to boast of a evaductor capable of inventing such admirable music, in vwhich genius and acquirements are equally manifest. Coming, too, immediately after the wonderfully briliant concerto of Mlendelssohn, the overture of Professor Bennett was exposed to a severe ordeal * but it passed triumphautly. Better executed it could not have been. The members of the Orchestra, to a man, showed the respect they entertained for their eminent compatriot by doing their utmost to give effect to his work; and their success was commensurate with their ambition. The applause at the end was enthusiastic; yet, while the unanimous desire was to hear the overture repeated, its composer, too modest to comply, was satisfied to return to the orchestra aud acknewledge the compliment. During the whole of last season only one of Professor Bennett's compositions was introduced at the Philharmonic concerts (his third pianoforte concerto performed by Miss A rabella Goddard); the genial weicome accorded to his beautiful overture list night will, however, it is to be hoped, en^ourage the directors to he lees timid on the subject. Mlodern art is not so rich inl masterpieces as to warrant such things as this, and others from the salme thand,nlofwunfortunately less productive, being laid upon Signor Sivori created an extraordinary sensation by his performance of Mendelssohn's concerto, which was in very many respeots splendid, but with which, nevertheless, we were not entire.y satisfied. The reading was Italian throughout; end, as the musio is solely end wholly German in spirit, this view of it did not alwrays fit. Signor Sivori's concestion of the first and second movements wiU be likely to fin defenders, whom to convince might possibly be a task more difficult than grateful; but the last movement is -to use a conventional word, for which our Language presents no equivalent-to all intents and purposes a "scherzo," and one of the most truly characteristic of its class. There are oertain peculiaritier in the Mendelssohnian schermo which cannot be overlooked by players desirous of interpreting conecientiously the meaning of their author. When Josepph Joachim (the first to play this violin-conoerto in Germany) asked how quick the last movement should be played, Mendeloh answered " As quick aa pe%ible-rt isa a clats-o." Signor Sivori (the first to perfosm it in England), appears to hold a di9irent opinion, since Iast night-as in 21T whea bheintroduced it at the Phuonic-be tool: the jinle as slow as possible -that s, as slow as yc e for a &se,-o. SMoreover, he endeayoured to tvrns the second theme into a singing phrase (5 ceNeWg"il' by inesting it rwith a. oertain expresaior out of beeping with music of ao impetaeus aad unrestrained a cha er.

The Prisoner had been convicted of the charge of stealing & pocket-handkerchief upon the evidence of "s& womanof the town," in whose possewion the handkerchief had Ieen fourd, and who swvore that it had been given toher by the prisoner. Hereceived,50lashes : A repetition of the experiments with Miartins shells was made in Voolwich laTsh on Saturday, over the usual range of 400 and 600 yards. The shells, filled with the ordina-ry amount of molten iron, 2S1b. each, were levelled at a balkhead, as on the former occasion, and the first shell which struck the object produced the desired effectof speedily ignitng. Fourteen similar shells were thrown insoceio, some of which pasqed completely through tze bulk-head ; four others fell wide of the mark, and the remainder proved to be as ssucessful as thefirt. Some additional experiments were likewise tried, -the objeot being to prove the solidity of sundry plates of steel and iron, the former 3 inches in thickness, and the latter 4A inches. The shot employedforthe tetwereof castiand wrought. iron, and were fired over the usual rsnge, 41 0 aOd 6w yards, from a 6S-pounder gum erected on a ewrlv invente ddwarf platform. The effect was clearlvvisible from the first shot, which passed through the entire -structure. Between 20 and 30 shots were fired with a smilar result. Major-General Lord H.

TO THB EDITOR OF TEE ZTIES. Sir,-Tn a letter which appears in your colamns this morning from a " Fellow of the Royal College of Snrgeons in England" the writer observes that he read with great srprise in your paper of the 30th ult. a statement of the President of the Xoyal College oftPhysicians to Sir George Grey, on the SAta, that the profession were -nanimous in their approbation of Mr. Headlasms Bill N0ow, turning to your paper of the 30th, I fnd myself cor rectly described as follows:-" Dr. Mayo introduced the deputation to Sir George Grsy, and in domg so said -e trusted that the pzofession at large had arrived at such an amount of unanimity as was possible, when it was considered into hor many seztions they were divided,-greater than had been obtained before." With this quotation I might leave the gentleman whom it answers to pursue his attack upon me as employing words which' I never used,-indeed, carefully avoided. But he is an admirer of Lord Elcho's medical Bill, as opposd to Mr. Headlam's; and on this point I wilL, with permission, state to him a few words which I did then use, in addition to those reported in The Times. I did state that whatever was good in Lord Elho's Bil was tobe found in Mr. Eleadlam's, vith a good deal more of an equally essential charcter; that Mr. Headlam's Bill provided for one system of education open to All, but that'it also provided for a more profound and more elevated educa. tion, and one requiring longer time, for those whose meins or who-e borourable ambition should enable them to engage in it. In this way Mr. Headlam's Bill provides for a progressive advance in practice and science, Lord Eicho's ofly for one minimum standard, which will itself, in the absence of eminent professors and teachers, be kept at alow level I also said that -Mr. Headlam's Bill contained a clafse allowing to the Crown the nomination of six membeis of the medical council, but that it did tend to discourage the profession or supersede its action in self-government, by making the whole council nominees of the Crown. This, I observed, would be the effect of Lord Eicho's Bill. I have the honour to be, Sir, yourobedient servant. THlR)fMAq RMAvn Juy e L Pres5dent of the Royal College of Physicinz.
THE DONALD 31'HAY AND LA HOGUE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of Saturday your Plymouth correspondent, while noticing the arrival of La Rogue, savs she sailed even days after the Donald M'Kay. This is a mistake, which we shal! feel obliged by your correcting, as the Donalda M ay did not sal until the 27-th of Febrary or seven days after La Hogue, instead ef seven days before. She landed some of her passengers at Crookhaven on the 2th ult., and we received our letters per La Rogue, and a letxter from the captain of the Donald .Kay by the same .ost, v;hich we think shows pretty clearly that the Donala ?d 'Kay has certainfly beaten La Rlogute siDC to seven days.

AT=PTEm I IrrtDEs.-An investigation was held 3 esterday by the coanty magistrates in Rochester with respect to a charge of attempted murder which had been preferred against a young man named George Parl,er, aged 21, wlo was accused of having discharged a pistol at a young woman named Mary Amr Taylor, residing at Percy-street. in the parish of Northfleet. The prosecut,ix, who is about 1S years of age, stated in the cnurse of her examination that she had known the prisoner, who was a hawker, about 9 months; that shehadmethim oa Saturday e euiDg last at the Roshcrrife Gardens, Gravesend, where he had a refreshment stallp that shahad lived withhiain, fur some time previously in the capacity ef servant, returning to her own residence each evening to sleep, and had determined to leave his service a few days before the present. occurrence had taken place, in cousequence of some differtnce which had arisen between them. She had accordingly. gone to the Rosherville Gardens on ihe evening in question, for the purpose of bringing away soeneaxtieles of dress which ehehad left at the prisoner's. Onseeinglhim she hadasked him for her Clothes, saying to him at the same time thatb she wantedi to have nothing to do with him or his place. The prisone-r had thereupon asked her vwetler sbe meant to. have himu or not, and she hacd statied in reply that she couldW not think of having him after his treatment of her on. the previous Thursday, whex he had struck .er. She had then proceeded upstairs to procure her clotbes anad had been fols lowed by tba prisor, who hadsuddenlypulled a itolont of his.peketasnd snapped it at her, sayng, "You shallh`ve. the oontents of this," She immediately ran oat of, thehouse, but on gaiunng the street te oDrisoner cane be- hinc her and stabbedher in the rig&t side with a lare clasp, tse. towansec,ed by some persons who wituessedIthe. trans"hon, and she was eonveyed home in a cab.

FOBEIGN INTBLLIaGNC&. FRAN= A portonof tbxe fo o gia ppe=zed in our £econdedition e: astard a |FROM OUR OWI? CO08 MPOLrDMT-.1 PARIS. StrNDAY, MA.Y 31, 6 P.!L The official lists of the Govermment candidatesxat the aDproaching elections were despatohed yesterday from the Home-office to the Prefects. These lists ame to be immediately made known to the population of each electoral district. This day's Moniteur contains a circular from the Minister to the Prefects on the same subject; it announce3 the wishes of the Emperor, indicates the candidates who are adopted by the Government, and points out to those fuanctionaries the line of conduct they are to observe under certain circumstances. I have already men- tioned that, with some exceptions, the same persons 1 who have shown tbem&elves so complying for the last five or six years, who, except in some rare imstances, vied with each other in the alacrity of their assent to the behests of the Emperor, and wvho so sedom and so faintly exhibited any sign of an independent wilfl, are now recompensed by berng recommended for re-election to the people. To the usveful qualities which the Government thus rewards-this "devotion of six ycars"-the Mcniteur attributes the preference of these candidates, and, as the Minister observes, " with some exceptions,required byspecial necessity, the Government has considered it just and politic to propose for re-election the whole of the members of an Assembly which has so well seconded the Emperor and served the country." Against whom in particular the black marks are made is not stated. The circular, moreover, announces that it is the will of the Emperor that at the elections universal suffrage shall be practised in all freedom and in all sincerity; that on ite day of election the voting shall be secret; that the ballot-bec be opened before the eyes of all, and that the truth and inde pendence of the suffage be guaranteed. Yet it adds,-" With that liberty insured to each, and 'while all-candidates and electorsmay proclaim their preference, the Government cannot be the only party to remain mute and indifferent. It wiL deolaretothe countrywhat are the names which possess its confidence and seem to it to merit that of the people; and, as it (the Government) proposes the laws to the Deputies, it will propose candidates to the electors, and these will then make their choice." Under such circumstancstho Government proposing the lawsa, and in reality naming the Deputies-the trouble of election seems to be altogether superfluous; and it w ould be a saving of timo, as of inconvenience to the electors, if the Emperor were at once to appoint the 261 "4epresontatives" without any appeal whatever to the people. The electors are informed that full freedom of choice is accorded to them, and that " Opposition candidates may be freely brought forward." The circular, however, adds:- " If the enevaies of pablic tranquillity think to find in tbis latitude the opportunity for a seditious protest agdinst our iastitutions, if they attempt to make of it an Instrument of trouble and of scandal, you know your duty, X. le Prefect, and justice will know how to fulfil its own duty as severely. Those excesses will not occur; but, If they do occur, their repression wlUl not prejudice the liberty of universal saff£age. Thrice sanctioned by it, the Emperor invokes it still with confidence." T have more than once aluded to the apprehension of the Government that the electors would, either from indifference or from the impossibility of a successful opposition to the official nominees, ab. dsain from exercising their rights. That apprehension is betrayed in the present circular; but it accounts for it in a manner very ftttering to the Imperial Government. " Invite them all to the ballot," the Minister odes; "they have made the Empire, they love it, and they wil know how to defend it in case of necessity. Full of confi. dence in the man of their choice, they completely rely on him, and would willingly abstain from taking part in the votes which the regular play of the Constitution periodioally demauds of thorm. Press them to come forward to naise their deputies, inform them that it is requisite to prove once more by the mass of their suffrages all the power of the Government which they have founded. The imperceptible minority of hostile parties, if it dare to come forward, vill be lost in that immense popular manifestation, and it will be for the world a grand and eloquent spectacle to see 9,000,000 electors, in a country not long ago so easy to convulse, coming peaceably forth at the voice of the :Emperor to intrust for six years more to their delegates the missaon of seconding him faithfuUy in his incessant efforts for the glory and prosperity of France." That the candidates named by the Government will be all, or nearly all, returned, there is little doubt. That the electors will flock in multitudes to the balloting urn, as desired, is by no means so certain. The Minister adds,- " When in 1851 and 1852 eight millions of suffrages gave to him (the Emperor) the crown and the destiies of the country, there was in that remarkable vote that love Mingled with pride which France felt in the depth of its heart towards the dynasty of the Napoleons ; there was between it and them a feeling of an indissoluble community in glory and misfortune; there was also the fear of anarchy and the hope of a Government strong and fiendly to the people. At this day the same popular prestige exists ln favour of the Bonapartes," &c. It is undoubtedly true that the Imperial Government enjoys as much prestige, perhaps more, among the masses of the people than any that has preceded it since the great Revolution; but neither the Emperor himself nor his warmest partisans ignore the fact, that authority in France depends rather on the ability and energy of the man who for the time possesses it than. on the affection and loyalty to any family on the part of the people. It could hardly be otherwise in a country which has been so often convulsed, and which has seen and accepted so many different forms of government. What Sovereign ever enjoyed more prestige, or was for the time more identified with the glory and enthusiasm of the people, than the first Napoleon ? To whom were more protestations of eternal attachment, of loyalty, of unshaken fidelity, offered than to him? And what monarch ever took more pains to lay the foundations of his authority deeper, and to perpetuate it, than he? Whose will was ever more universally obeyed than his ? Yet in the height of his power a madman, a silly old priest, and a young corporal projected the overthrow of that government ; and,what is still more strange, all but car-ried it into execution. Malet, with hardly any resources at his command, succeeded in arretingSavary, theMinister of Police, in his bed,and confined him anad Pasquler, his Prefeet, in the prison of La Force. He bribed the Colonel of the 10th Cohort, and made himself master of the Hotel de Ville, and had a strona militaryforcetoguard its approaches, and occupied with troops the Place Vendome. The Prefect of the Seine obeyed Malet without a murm^ur; they set about making arrangements for the formation of a provisional Government, anAd completely forgot, or disrecarded, the fact that the Empress and the Imperii] Prince were inA Paris. Tt is not necessary to repeat all the details of that extraordinary attempt on the part of an obscure and half crazy man to overthrow a system like that of Napoleon merely by circulating the report of the Emperors death. Not only the facility with which the first measures of the conspirator were carried out, but the total forgetfulness that the Emperor's son was in ex!Atence, produced the deepest and the most painful inpression on the mind of Napoleon. He saw how in that crisis the succession of the King of Rome soemed, as if by common consent, to be completely net aside. If he h ever before doubted it, he then, indeed, had the conviction that the Imperial power rested on himself alone, and that the wonderful deeds at home and abroad which had won it for him were no guarantee that it would descend bO Wis family. " All this," cried the Emperor despondingly, when he read the report of what had passed-" officers leading their regiments to force te l andI --A-make the hIghest authorities prisonets -the Amnister ot State shut up in prion-the Prefect of the capital pro gto forma new government-all this while the mpress is on the spot, while the King of Rome is alive, while my Ministers andi all the great officers of State are at hand I" No Minister, no General, nio friend could express more ardent devotion to the present ruler of France, or more readiness to rally round him and his family, than did thoe of the first Napoleon. What future changes are reserved for the country it ifs difficult to say, but I doubt whether the E1mperor himself feels any certainty that he or his would, in an emergency which I trust is far distant, fnd men much different from what they were on other occasions. Reveiting to the elections, I may say that the rumour which represented X. Drouyn de Lhuys a about to present himself a; a candidate is unfounded. I am informed that at a. meeting.of the epiulturista of the Seiae et Mu= on the 1 ^th M. Drouyn de Lhuys took the opportunity of de, claring to the electors who were present that the reasons which had, induced him to resiga his functions of Senator wouldt not allow him again to. enter public life.. If it be true that the 31inister of the Interior has given a decided awid as it would appear, a successful! opposition to the project of sending to the departments a certain number Iof Chamberlains and other persons attached to the Courtas candidates for the new Camber, it does him great credit. He is, no doubt, awa we witbtvwhat repugnance the electors would receive those persos, of whose nmes they are, for the most part, ignorant. The Moniteur publishes the reports of Generals Renault, M'Mahon, andYousaouf, who commnded the tbree divisions which, under the orders of Marshal Randon, attacked on the 24th of May the positions of the kabyles in the mountains of AitAkerma and Afenson with complete success. Their loss was 1 officer kdlled (Major Boyer, of the 54th Regiment of the Line) and 3 officers wounded, 61 privates killed and 414 woundel A aubsequent despateb, received by telegraph from Marshal Randon, dated from the camp of El-Hadj-Ali, the 26th of May, announces that the Beni-Raten were beginning to come.to terms. T he C7ansiutio#nW publishes a private letter from the Persian Gulf, received thr*ugh Bagdad, which announces that on the 21st of Api the Bfitish troops evacuated the town of Mohammerah, of which they had taken posaession at the latter end of Marob. The steainships Comet, Planet, and Assyria brought the British troops ba6k to Bushire. General Outrami continued to evacuate the Persian Gulf. The British troops were beginning to experience rather aevere losses by dizease. Letters from Teheran state that the Persian army on the frontiers of Affghanistan, was already evacuating the districts occupied by it. It had already quitted Furah, and would soon evacuate Herat. Marshal de Castellane has been sent by the Emperor from Lyons to Geneva to compliment the Dowager-Empress of Russia. BELGIUM. The King of the Belgians issued h Royal decree on Saturday, the 30th May, proroguing the sittings of the Chamber of Representatives and of the Senate for an indefinite period. The same excitement continues to prevail at Braseels, and similar scenes have been enacted at Antwerp, Mons, Liege, and Ghent. At Antwerp all the windows of the Jesuits' College have been smashed. The streets had to be cleared by the troops, but it does not appear that any collision took place. The people retire before the troops and then reassemble. A letterfrom Brussels, dated 8 o'clock onSaturday night, sayse- "De8pite the adjournment of the Cha-mbers and a heavy rain, which seemed likely to put a stop to assemblages, the fourth Legion of the Artillery of the Civic Gusrd was calUed out. "The Communal Council hs drawn up an addr. to the King." A despatch dated Brussels, Saturday, 9 p.m., says - "The city is trnquil. There are a few groups on the Grande Place. In consequeneo of the rain, the troops are not out. "1 It may be presrnmed that no disturbances we take piae during the night." Another despatch says " BKUSSELS, M&Y 31, 7 A.M. "The night has passed over without disturbance. " The town is resuming its usual peaceful appearance." Demonstrations have taken place at Bruges and Namur. AUSTRIA. (OSOM OUR OWN 0O0ararPOlDl) T.) VIENNA, X&y 29. A day or two since I sent you some statistical information which was taken from a State paper that circulates in high official circles, and subjoined is an analysis of the second part of the same document, wh-oh treats of the expenditure:- " During the 17 years between 1831 and 1847 the annual outlay for the Austrian army varied from 50,184,000P. as a minimum to 78,522,000dl. as a maximum. The average expenditure during the above-mentioned 17 years was 57,730,000f. a-year, or 173,190,09001 in three yea The ordinary and extraordinary outlay for the army during the three years 1854, 1855, 1856i amounted to 548,572,000D., and this enormous expenditure is thus acounted for. The political events of the last few years have compelled Austria to keep on foot in the interior of the empire a large army fully prepared for action, and also to place troops in Germany, non-Austrian Italy, and the Danubian Principalities. Although not engaged in the Oriental war, the armawnents which Austria was obliged to make were not much less expensive than they would have been if she had taken an active part in it. As is well known to the world the exertions and sacrifices of Austria materially contributed to the restoration of peace. The deterioration of the curecy greatly increased the expenditure, as the State was frequently obliged to make good the difference between silver and paper, although it was forced to take the deteriorated notes at their nominal value in payment of the taxes. As the paper money became less valuable the price of the necessaries of life rose, and the Government was therefore obliged to raise the pay of the common soldiers, lower employes, State servants, &o. During the year 1854 the premium on silver varied between 15 and 361 per cent., the average premium being rather above 25per cent.-sothat the outlay for the army in that year was in reality (in silve) 166,956,00011. The nominal outlay (in bank-notes) was 208,696,000Ji. During the last year-and-a-half the average premium on silver has been 5 per cent., so that the revenue in 1856 was fully 20 per cent. (the difference in the premium on silver) higher in value than it was in 1854. Since the year 1847 Austria has expended much more of her revenue for warlike purposes than the other first-rate militar Powers. The average expenditure of Austria for her army during the years 1854, 1855, and 1856 was 38 1i5 percent.; that of France, 31 1-12 per cent.; and that of Prussia, a frac. tion more than 29 per cent. The budget for the ordinary expenditure of the Austrian War Department during the year 1851 was 105,328,723d., but 9,200,322fL out of that sum was disbursed for fortifications, barracks, &e. In 1851 the stat of the army was 603,879 men and 77,540 horses; but itneed not beso lage in future, as the railroads 'will enable Governmuent to bring together its troops at any given point snould extraordinary events render a concentration necessary. In yeas of peace the future expenditure of the War Department ought to be below 100,000,0001., -which is 73 per cent. more than the average outlay during the 17 years between 1831 and 1847. The cause of the increase in the expenditure of the other departments is the complete change which has been made in the administration. The interest oL the national debt is much laer than it was nine years ago, and large sums have been expended for the emancipation of the soil, for the abolition of the 'patrimonial' jurisdictlon, for the formation of the Gendarmerie, regiments, &c." The inference drawn by the official writer from his statement of facts is that the deficit will ceae " if the ordinary receipts increase 32,579,000fl. during the next three years-that , 10,860,000fi. during each year-if the mazirnum of the outlay for the army is 100,000,0001. per annum, and if there ceases to be a premium on silver." Iii my opinion, it is neither probable that the revenue Will increase in the same ratio as it has done during the last three years, nor that the Minister of Finance will be able to reduce the total expenditure of the War Department to a hundred mioion of florins. Th:e foRowing is a summ&ry of newa eoncr--- the journey of their Majestiesin ungary. During their various progresses the Emperor and Empress have been continually enveloped in immense clouds of dust raised by the Banderia which have escorted them, but neither of them expreseed any disapprobation of the arrangements made by the provincial authorities. 3ler Majesty, who produes an ex- tremely favourable impresion on the Magyars won all heart at Jasz-Bereny by promising to begin to learn Hungarian as soon as she got back to Vienna. It attracted the attention of the Imperial travellers that some of the male dancers of the " Csardas" (national dance) wore two small looking-glases in their caps-the one in front and the otber behind.; but the use which was made of them by the girls whenever an Opportunit prebented itself rendered it unnecessary to ask why they were placed there.

The record of events passing at this capital during the spring season of the year is seldom more than a chronicle of the goings and comings of the Royal Family and their 'visitors. This day last week I announced to you what the movements of the former were to be during the following few days, and the only striking thing I have to state to-day is that those arrangements have been strictly adhered to. The King, Queen, and Prince of Prussia returned yesterday evening from Schwerin, whither they had proceeded, to be present at the inauguration of the new Grand Ducal Schloss; and to-day their Majesties will proceed toPotadam andspendWhitsun. tide there. To-morrow week isthe anniversary of the death of the late King, which is still observed by all the members of the Royal Family as a jday for pivate r6union and sad recollection. When that is past the King wilt set off for Marienbad, the Queen to Toplitz, the Prince of Prussia to Coblentz, and Prince Frederick William to pay a visit to our Court, where he is to stand godfather to the lastborn Princess. On his way thither he will stop a day or two with his mother, the Princess of Prassia, at Coblentz, who, as wrell as the Prince, is prevented fromn accompanying the young Prince to ERagland on this occasion by the approach of their daughter's (the GrandDuchess of Baden's) confinement; towards the end of Jnne the Princess will, on this account, proceed to Carlamube and make a somewhat lengthened stay there. The last steamer from St. Petepsburg broulght Count Nesselrode to Stettin. Re is at present staying at the Russian Embassy here, and in a few days he will proc-ed to Kissingen. The Russian Minister for Popular Enlightenment also, M. Noroff, was lately here, and visited various institutions connected with education, mediclne, &c. The spring parades, field-days, and exercises o' this garrison came to an end last Wednesday, and now there is nothingmore of the sort to be expected until the auumn Iuanceuvre take place. At one of these, the Kmig3 manbrre, to be held in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg in September, it W&S for some time reported that the Emperor Louis Napoleon would be present, and so give a meetiny to the Emperor Alexander II. in the territories of the King of Prussia; but this plan, although it was for zome time seriously sur It tapis, has been entirely given up. To judge from vatious Paris letters, it has been expected in that capital that the King of Pr-ussia would shortly pay the first visit there; but there seems at present no intention on this side to visit the French capital, and very possibly this is the reason why the other plan has not been realized. It nevertheless remains none the less probable that the King of Prussia and the Emperor Louis Napoleon will come together in the course of this autumn. The Emperor hu promised to return the King of Bavara's visit before the cone of the year, and on his account there is to be a very considerable camp at Augsbnrg. Either here or in Carlaruhe, when the Emaperor returns the visit paid to him lately by the Grand Duke of Baden, we may confidently expect the meeting to take place. One of the best results that will ensue from the escapade of the Neuchatel Royalists last September is the emigration of about 40 families from the canton of Neuehatel, who will continue to pursue their handieraft of malkng watohworks in this country. The Government had already some years back established a small manufactory for wateher at a place called lilhun, in Silesia, for the purpose of affording employment to the population of that province, which is now impoverished by the d,l,ne of hand-weaving; the little watchwork colony has already extended to 150 persons employed in the establishment, and it will now all at once receive a large augmentation from these Royalist emigrant. Berlin has been already materially enriched and improved by a colony of French emigrants, who setled. there after the revocation of the edict of Nantes; Potadam has also one or two Russian colonies; and now Silesia also will get its Swiss colony.

The steamer Teviot, from Southampton, arrived at Pernambuco on the lt of Iay. The political intellgence is unimportant. At Pernambuco large purchases of sugar had been made at 2,850 to 2,900 reis per arroba. A decline in prices was looked for in consequence of a scarcity of shipping. Cotton was quoted 7,500 to 7,700. Hides were selling at 346 reLe per lb. There wras a brisk demand for manufactured goods at remunerating prices. Money for discounting was sarce, the Rank rate being 10 per cent. per annum. Exchange on London to the extent of 30,0001. had taken place at 27Ld. for 90 days bills. Freights to the Channel. were 50s., and to the Continent 55s. to 60a., with 5 per cent. primage.

Better prices would have been obtained had it not unfortunately happened that the Provincial Acembly had notified to the bakers that the lai paeed two years ago, ordering all the bakers to remove their ovens to the suburbs of the cities, would be put into force on the 30th of June.

TEE UNIED STATES {Fnow OUR OWN 4 NEW YORK, X&Y 19. " Bleeding Kansas," after a thorough depletion, bids fair to bepronouiced convalescent even by the doctors who declared the disease mortaL Mr. Walker, formerly Secretary of the Treasury, has left with his staff for the territory to assume the position of Governor, and settle the difficulties, if possible. As Mtr. Walker. is an aspirant for the succession, and one whose past career and acknowledged abilities justify his aspirations, and as he has the fall confdence and support of the Administration, there is every reason to hope that peace will be restored, and an honest expression of the wishes of the settlers obtained. That this will result in the exclusion of slavery seems to be the belief among all parties. The Free State imien refuse to take part in the coming elections for delegates to the convention to form a State constitution. No effort has been spared to induce them to change their course of action in this respect, but withoat effect. To meet this contingency Governor Walker advises that the convention frame a constitution that shall be silent on the question of alavery, and leave the people at some subsequent time to settle it. Whether theae men, with the power in their hands, wil listen to counsels which, if adopted, must result m ta3cing it fromthem rems to be seen. Both Democrats'and Republicans in this part of the country seem to think that they wril. I will not hazard an opinionl on a matter so soon to be settled5 and about which I feel that one at this distance cannot take a correct view. General Walker holds out to the friends of slavery the hope of adrnitting the Indian territory (to the south of Kansas) into the Union as a Slave State, as an inducement to yield Kansas to the Free State party. The bait may take, but at what a sacrifice of national justice ! When the " Missouri Compromise" was enacted nearly the whole of what is now the best cotton planting country-the uplands of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi-was in the occupation of the aborigines, their possession guaranteed by treaty. The Creeles, to the number of about 20,000, occupied the eastern part of Alabama and the western part of Ilorida; the Cherokees, to the number of 12,000, a part of North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama; the Choctaws, to the number of 20,000, and the Chickasaws, to the number of 4,000, the State of Mississippi; and the Seminoles, tothe number of 4,000, the territory of Florida. The "manifest destiny," asit is caUed, of the white man, having first driven them across the Mississippi, now pursues them again, and threatens to drive them from the hunting grounds which a treaty of only a quarter of a century ago promised should be theirs for ever. The Indian, whether enervated by an attempt at imitating divilization, or exhasiated by the "11 ire-water" vhich the white man gives him in the savage state, is equally incapable of competing wvith the frontiersman (or border ruffian)-a bold reckless sceptic, who has faith in nothing but his rifle, his pluck, and his whisky bottle, is unsparing to his enemies, generous to his friends, and careless of himself. Central American affairs engross little public attention. The fate of the DalUas-Clarendon Treaty was much less than a nine days' wonder. The AngloSaxon states with a by-authority air that if Honduras ratifies the treaty between Great Britain and itself Lord Napier will lose no time in proposing to the Government of the United States to enter into negotiations at once, for the purpose of re-agreeing to the Dallas-Clarendon treaty at length, On the other hand, the Herad assures its readers that it has positive information from Honduras, that the treaty has been ratified by the Government there. Putting these two statements together, and assuming their truth, the logical conclusion would be that the treaty would soon be re-vivified. It is really not a matter of much consequence whether it be or benot revived. Central America has gone so far that it will very soon take care of itself without reference to either Government. But, ap'ropos of this adjustment, the official paperstill the Washintsm Union-is throwing out vague feelers for public opinion, to the effect that this country will take care of this continent, and will have no entangling alliances. Meanwhile the people on the Isthmus are taking matters into their own hands. Walker is, of course, in a critical situation according to one story, and on the high road of success accordin- to tho other. H3is friends represent him as nctorious in a great battle, wherein, like Joshua, he had surrounded the foe and annihilated them at the sound of the trumpet, without loss to himself. Others, who do not believe that such miracles are vouchsafed in these sinful days, say that he has fledthe country, and taken refuge beneath that universal safeguard, the cross of St. George. The latter rumour comes by way of New Orleans, and is not confirmed by the George Law, arriving at this port. Be the condition of the Transit Route what it may, however, the Government of Panama seem disposed to put the state of that route beyond question. The new Government have introduced and carried through the Chamber of Representatives a Bill authorizing the Executive to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain, France, the United States, and Sardinia, on the following bases: "1. The Isthmus of Pauama, at present an integral part of New Gransdz, shall horeafter be a sovereign and independent State, free for the commerce of all nations, under the gnarsntee and protection of the contracting Powers. "1 2. Limits the boandary lines to that lately made with Costa Rica, and that which, according to the law of 18f7, divides the province of Choco from the territory of Darion. 3 . The islands on both oceans, at present belonging to the State, shall be included, as also those of San Andres, lTew Providence, and others, forming the present canton of San Andres in the province of Carthagena. "14. The contractingPowers shall have liberty to transport their mails over the railroad or any other interoceanic route as follows :-New Granada, without paying anything either to the State or to the railroad company, England and the United States to pay $W,000 a-year each to the State. and France and Sardinia $25,000 each, beeide paying to the raUroad company l0c. a-pound for letters, and lc. a-pound for newspapers. The railroad company to pay also $50,000 a-year to the State of Panama. "- 5. The State of Panama shall not tax mails, &c. The railroad company may charge for mails of nations not parties to this treaty. " 6. The State of Panama shall acquire the rights and obligations of NTew Granada in regard to the raiload company, except those reseved by this law." The same steamer, the George Law, which brings us the account of the doings of the Government of Panama,lalso brings the agreeablesum of $1,700,000 in gold to relieve the market from the pressure of the spring shipments of specie, and the stil more agreeable newis of the alaerity displayed in California for meeting the debt which the Supreme Court had declared to be unconstitutionaL A Bill has been introduced into the Legislature to provide for the payment of the interest on the public debt due in July and January next; also another Bill " to provide for payina certain equitable claims against the State of Ca6fornia, and to contract a funded debt for that parpose." The latter Bill had passed the Senate and was be'ore the Aesembly. It proposed to levy a tax of 30 cents on each $100 of taxable property, yielding an annual revenue of $300,000, of which $27,000 was to go to form a sinking fund for the redemption of the principal in 1876. The claim of the State against the Federal Government, amounting to about $3,000,000, for duties collected by the United States' revenue officers before the admission of California into the Union, is also devoted by the Bill to the payment of the State's indebtednes The Bill proposes that a vote shall be taken in September next to ratify the doings of the Legislature. The San Francisco Buletin feels " confident that the verdict of her citizens will then retrieve California fiom the temporary stain of repudiation which has been cast upon her by illconsidered legislation." I sincerely hoDe that this may be so. I should be very sorry to see the new and vigorous State of Californa added to the list of repudiating States. Michigan, Flori2a, and Mississippi are, I believe, the only States that sank under the crash of 183>7 which have not made some effort to resume their places among solvent, paying, and respectable comnnunities. Al three of these States must before long meet the just demands of their creditors. Michigan lies between the lakes. Population hitherto has passed rath6r below her; bat the developement of the Canadian peninsula insures I her growth, and a3 population flovs in upon her she will be compelled to re-establish her, credit. Florida also begins to grow and to want I credit. She- has chartered an excellent system of railwiys,, witi-hand ba4es, to develope her cotton fields; but the companies find the bonds lumber on Iheir hands while the State is tainted with repudi,lion. 3ississippi is a harder cas-but even that State will be forced in the end to come right. I shall be much disappointed if California, although made up of such heterogeneous elements, ever joins the ranks of the repudiators. Governor Dramnond has arrived in Washington from Utab, and with him have come letters to the New York journgls from, to use an Americanism, "reliable sources." They picture a despotism com- wared with which John of Leyden stinding over Fides with a drawn dagger is an amiable gentleman. The general outlines of the pioture have reached us before, but here we have the filling up. The correspondent of the Daily Times tells us of a Federal Court terminated with the bowie knife and the revolver; of a Mormon prosecuting officer enterngnoUeprosequs against Mormon murderers of Gentiles; of a federal judge intimidated by pistols Dlaced at his head and dirks at his throat while sitting on the bench; and of what they call in Kentucky a "free fight " within the bar, while these exciting amuse. ments were going on upon the bench. The correspondent of the Tribune deals more in eocial matters. He tells how he heard a Mormon bishop-one Kimball-" in the presence of between 2,000 and 3,000 people deliver a discourse on the intercourse of the sexes, ia which he made use of language too obscene for the most degraded to utter, literally calling things by their right nmnes." He says that the Rabbi'and cniefs of the Sanhedrim accusewomen by name, in their public discourses, of being "prostitutes," to further their own lascivious purposes; and gives the name of a bishop who accused a married woman to her husband of infidelity to gain her to his own uses. He gives names and dates, also, for other outrages too horrible to be repeated. The circumstantiality of these narratives forbids us to disbelieve them. Public opinion loudly calls upon the Government to do something to check the tide of corraption and treason. It is understood that if the Texas Ranger to whom the post of Governor has been offered shaU decline, it wil be given to Judge Drummond, with a sufficient military force to enable him to put down the despotism of the fanatics, and protect all who wish to leave the superstition. Just at this juncture there is a report that the Mormons themselves have risen against their tyrant, and expelled him from their settement, and that he is now, if alive, a wanderer among the Indians. The rumour is not credited here. It is believed to be a lie, set on foot by his agents to prevent the Government from sending a force this year to restore order in the territory. Unless despatched at once, it will be impossible for any force to traverse the great plains between the settlements and the Rocky Mountains, and cross the high passes before winter. It is thought that these ramours are intended to impede the action of Government until a demonstration is impossible the present year. The contest for manicipal power in New York is rapidly coming to a head. The parties have made up a "case" for the Courts which will decide the question. Meanwhile the boundaries of the power of each are daily becoming well defined. Brooklyn submits to the Metropolitan Board, and there are strong signs of weakness in the reZiting New York parties. The taxpayers pray in the contest for anything that will give them a government and an effective police. The signs at Louisville and elsewhere of the failure of municipal power to preserve order and protect life in the midst of party excitement, political prejudice, or the prejudice of caste and colour, have induced thinking men to welcome any form of government which will insure a vigorous and reasonably honest administration of power. All great communities need protection against the lazy, the idle, the profligate, and the "rowdy"-nonemorethanNewYork. Themetropolis needs a police, independent of party organizations, and devoted solely to the preservation of order. The new laws propose to organize such a system, under a metropolitan commission. But 8o much has been said about the invasion of municipal rights and destruction of liberty (they must have bor rowed a leaf from some of the London metropolitan vestries) that it is doubtful whether the new laws will be enforced in their full rigour. The proprietors of the Daily Times offer $5,000 reward to whoever will discover evidence to convict the murderer of Dr. Burdell. Some of the other jounals who do not make an offer make fun of the proposition. The Evening Post offers 5,000 peanuts, and the Herald throws dollars to the winds in gratuities for the discovery of all the undiscovered murderers for the past 20 years. Mrs. Cunningham goes abroad, an acquitted woman, and Eckel is discharged on his own recognizance, his counsel grumbling because the Goverrnment prefer to bring him to trial six months hence. One more victim has fallen to the mysterious National-Hotel disease-a member of Congress, from Pennsylvania. I call it "mysterious" because some persons still insist upon catling it a case of poison, aimed at estimable Mr. Buchanan. The doctors all say the other way. They we all agreed that it was a case of malaria, arlsing from the bad condition of the sewers. The opening near the hotel for the escape of the gas from thenpublic sewers was closed, because so offensive to the passers-by. Tn consequence of this the fetid air was driven back into the hotel, and filled the pipes employed to supply fresh air, which the hot-air furnace was to warm and dischargethroughout the house. In this way the whole house was filled with the poison, and thus, say the doctors, we account for the deaths. The news from the south is not favourable for the cotton crop of this year. We have at this timo of the year regular accounts of the failure of the crop, but I am inclined to think that the accounts of a probably short crop are better founded than usual. The deficit in the crop of last year will not be much less than 500,000 bales. The depressed state of feelng still continues in financial circles, nor is it likely thattlhere will be a change for the better until the London moneymrarket is easier. The imports also greatly exceed the imports for the corresponding period of last year, and a drain of specie in the aututmn is feared. Money is comparatively easy, owing to the general wrant of activity int business. Loans on call, 7 per cent.; first-class paper, 8 per cent.; second-class, 9.

THE WOOLWICH ABTISANS. TO THE EDITOR OF T1E TIHES. Sir,-The appeal we lately made through your columns for assistanoe to relieve the great distress here has been answered in the House of Commons by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer,who not only demurs to the duty of Government to assist its discharged operatives, but denies that aay great distressexists. Iouly wishtherighthon.geatleman,and those who sharo his incredulity, would give me an opportunity of showing him a few of the cases which meet our eyes at every turn, and tempt us to ask if it be indeed true that " the powers that be re ordained of God." I woould introduce him to houses where not a jug was left to take home the offered soup, and wvhere children crouched at the approach of visitors to hide their very nakedness. I would show him women and children lying sickken bae boards idng only "a penny rollt-ptrated, as the doctor would tell him, simply by "the want of suffioient nourishment." He wouald hear men tell how, week after week, they had walked the surrounding country till their limbs ached and the shoes were worn from their feet, thinking themselves happy to find empIoyment far below the ordinary rate of wages. No less than six such persons have been at my door since I began this letter. Mr. Arthur hIurhy, one of oureommittee, was in Ireland at the time of the famine, and he solemnly dedlaes he never saw cases of greater distress there than have come under his notioe in his visits to these operatives. If the Chanoellor of the Exchequer still appealed to the Poor-law Statistics, I would point to the regation which requires all able-bodied men in this parish to earn their reliet by breaking stone. at the Union Workhouse, five miles off. and restricts the allowanoe to 3s. 6d, if sinzle, or if married 4s. 6d. a-week, and then ask him to jiule what amount of distrems a respectable mechanic -would undergo ere he submitted to become a pauper on such terms. I am orry Her Majesty's Ministers shoul&talk of etsblishing "a bad precedentI by interting themselves in the fate of their discharged operatives. Is a landed proprie for to be held up to public obloquy who recklesy evicts his tenants, and wiJI the Governmeat prodaim by its emple that a manufactur may at any moment rid himsef of is operatives without a thought for their future welfare ? It is infinitely more importnt for the country itat our great national workshops should set the right key. in the relations of employer and employed than that they ishould be models in activity aud invention. Yet, with a large acquaintance among our great manufacturers, I know not one who would have shown the same indifference to the moral and phyical welbeing of ls operatives as I have witnessed on-the part of Goernent during the four years of my present incumbency. - .

THR SLA YB. STATES OF AMBRIOA. (FROM OuR n mkrEqwmThwIA RICHMOND, VRGINIA, WAY 14. One of the few onifons of pary documents pub. liahed during the last Piesidential election was a map of the Federation in whih all the Slave States were coloured a deep blacik It was an impressie appeal to the eye instead of the ear, and probably had more effect than many stump speeches. The brightred and yellow tints of the North and Weit contrasted strongly with the " hue of darklem and eclipse" spread over the States of the South. The main inference intended to ba drawn from the huge blot was that slavery had increased, vas increasing (it was then threatening to absorb Kansas), and ought to be diminislied; it was also meant to denote that all covered by the sable tinge was under a kind of blight, moral and physical, by which real prosperity was chilled and destoyed. Whether the oont_amt is really as great and as sharply defined as the naIpmaker depicted it may be doubted; but certinly there is a difference, and contrast, too, betweeuL the Northern and the Southern States. They differ more from each other than any two nations of Europe. The rapid and continual progress of the North in wealth, population, and every ldnd of enterprise hascast a shadow over the Southern States; and on none does it rest so deeply as on Virginia, whicht lies nearest to the towering affuence whence so many younger communities look down on her. She is-described as effete, wornout, and deayed; and, unfortumately, it cannot be denied that Virginia has deucended from the placel she once held. The lapse of time has left her relatively less important than she was a century ago, for the change is rather relative than absolutie; she is no longer the wealthiest, or most populovs, or most caltivated of the American States, as in the days when she had few competitors and no rivals, and whea she represented to the European mind the whole of America. But the great relative change froim her former position is not absolute decay, though easily represented as such; Virginia is more widely cultivated now than when her fields were known as "the plantations," and she contains mora individual wealth now than in what are considered her best days; she probably owes in her State debt more money than the old tobacco planters ever dreamed of possesing, as property, and if she had been continually descending to the decay that ends in extinction she would never have been able to borrow it. In short, in America, where the race is to the swift, Virginia has been distanoed; but the people are proud of her past, and Governor Wise, to judge by his latest mnifesto, has an unbounded and glowing faith in her future; her present position, it is generally admitted, is not quite satisactory. For the better part of a century the " Old Dominion" has not been lucky; when the cultivation of tobacco had " scourged" and exhausted the eastern and seaboard plain her commercial prosperity declined; and the period of decline cofnmenced long before the era of railroads, which have in some degree revived it. For more than. half a century the finest portion of Virginia was shut oat from the markets; the whole State is unfortunate in its geographical position. It is an immense block of land without ready accss to the two great river systems of the continent; a double chain of mountains cuts off its sea-coast from the Ohio and the Mississippi, and the rivers and canals of the north carry the commerce of the growing north-west to Boston anad New York. The rivers of Virginia only open a part of her territory to the sea, ceasing to be navigable long before they reach the centre of the State; andall the soil they made acoessible to trade was beginning to be exhausted at the period of the Revolution. As long as the land he'ld out the produce was shipped with little difficulty; the Bristol shippers could sail quietly up the James and the Potomac, and take in their cargoes at the landing-places of the plantations themselves. When the culture of tobacco declined, the commerce of the eastern district decayed; for the produce of the settlements between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghauies went northward, while the country beyond the AUeghanies found its outlet far to the south. The trade of Virgmia created no great towns or depbts within its own borders. The natural separation of the State into three or four districts separated the people into as many communities with different interests, or different views of what was really the same in importance to a4 and internal improvements were long checked by these local feelings. It is only of late years that this obstacle has been partly overcome; and even in the direction it has given to the railways of the State it has had a mischievous influence. .AAs the State of Viuginia covers a surface about as large as England and Wales together, it will ba easily understood how these differences arose. Its geographical divisions are unfortunately complete and distinct, having better frontiers between each other than defend any part of the Prussian monarchy. The first district extends from the sea to the end of tide water in the rivers; the second from the head of the rivers to the foot of the Blue Ridge; the third is the great valley between this chain of mountains and the parallel chain of the Alleghanies, a country in itself; the fourth lies beyond the Alleghanies, extending to the Ohio. There has been little feeling of a common interest between the inhabitants of the sea-coast and those of the banks of the Ohio with the mountain ranges between them. It may also be said that the people of Virginia form three nations, or at least three States, and how difficult it is to conciliate the local feelings and prejudices of two States may be seen illustrated at thias moment in the violent quarrel between New York and New Jersey about a Eite for a quarantine station, the two cities having really the same interest in each others freedom from an epidemic as London and Southwark. It is the eastern or seaboard district of Virginia that is now threatened with an invasion of Northern free labour, organised by Er. Ei Thayer and a joint-stock oompany. The Vrginians are promised an improvementthat will go far to renovate the Old Dominion; but they do not appreciate the offer, "fearing the Greeksland the gift they bring with them." S.^ma reject the plan with scorn, declaring they would rather see the wharves of Eichmonj. and Norfolk rotting into the water, and the fields reverting to forest, than that they should be covered with produce and exports under the hands of the restless and acquisitive Yankee. Others spy, let them try it; if they bring only labour before thev can manure the land into fertility they will t-arve; and the appearance of much of the soil really lends the discouraging prediction a probabiity, of fulfilment. It they bring capital, it is added, they are much more likely to be converted into supporters of slavery than to shake the institution; the chief fear being that the movement is a cruse against alavery in disguise. 3eddes these opinion, there is a large amount of incredulity as to any result whatever. it is not beieved that the pro. posers of the plan are in eamrest and the proposals put forth are called "ga" The sum annoUnced as having been raised as the capital of tha new company is $200,000-not enough, sy themlcontents, to buy up one-fourth of the smallest county in the State. Sach istheloca opiniox of the schemie. Yet,while repelling an experiment inlthe iiretion of improvement, it is insited that the undeveloped wealth of the State is enormous, snaGoyernorwi,. lhas justpublihed= an estimate of it1hat is aluring

KINPlTR.xTV l This was an adjourned aummons from Chambers in the nature of an appeal, the chief clerk having placed Mr. W. 0. G. Tacker on the list of contributiores to this company, which was projected in 1855, failed in 1856, and was in course of winding-up. The question to be decided was whether Mr. Tucker, never having signed the deed of settle. menthand made a promise only (verbally) to take shares, but ving acted as a director in various ways, could be regarded as the holder of 100 shares, inasmuch as that was a necessary qualification to constitute a director. Ir. Glasse and Mr. Cole appeared for Mr. Tacker; Mr. Anderson and Mr. Fischer appeared for the official manager. Mr. GLASsR was heard in reply.

This was a bill by the Newry and Enniskillen Railway Company against the defendant WV. S. Spackman, who from January 1850 to October 1855 was one of the directors and chairman of the company, for an account of moneys received by him out of the funds of the company during the years 1853, 1864, ard 1855, and for obtaining payment to the company of,the balance which on the taking of such accounts might be found to be due to them from the defendant. The case occupied the Court the whole day, and is not yet concluded. Mr. Bacon and Mr. S peed are for the plaintiffs; M. AL D. Lewis for the defendant. (Before Vice-Chanaegor Sir W. P. WooD.) RUSHOnT V. TURNER, The object of this suit was to set aside a certain indenture of mortgage, purporting to have been executed by the plaintiff, as frauduleut and void, and to restrain an aotion commenced by the defendants against the plaintiff, upon the covenant contained in the mortgage deed. The plaintiff bad for man yers employed as his solicitor the defendant Cheslyn Hall, who became bankrupt in 1856, and has subsequently been struck off the Rolls. Large sums of money were from time to time received for the plaintiff by Hall, who was largely indebted to him at the time of his bankruptcy-to such an extent, indeed, that the plaintiff had proved for, and received a dividend upon, 40,0001. against Hall's estate in bankruptcy, a further debt of 12,0001. being left to meet costs alleged to be due from the plaintiff to Hall. In January, 1854, the title deeds of Cownham Farm, in Glocestershire, belonging to the plaintiff, were in the hands of Hall, together with the title-deeds of other property belongng to him. ?A mortgage of Cownham Farm had been made by the plaintiff to Hall in 1847, but this bad been paid off before 1854, though no reconveyance bad been executed. In January, 1854, the defendant Turner, who also employed Hall as his solicitor, entrusted him with a sum of 2,7001. of which he was a trustee, together with Hall, for the purpose of investment. Ealt represented to Turner that the plaintiff required an advance of this sum upon mortgage. A deed was prepared by him, dated the 21st of January, 1854, and purporting to be a mortgage from the plaintiff to the defendants of Cownham. Farm, forthesumof 2,6001., Hall being the only attesting witness to the deed. No part of this money was ever paid to the plaintiff, who executed the deed inignoranceof its naturo and effect from the great confidenoewhich be had always reposed in Cheslyn HalL In December, 1855, the plaintiff put up for sale Cownham Farm, believing that he was the absolute owner, free from any encuambrance, and an offer having been made the purchase was on the eve of completion, when it was discovered that Cheslyn Hall had fraudulently deposited the title deeds with his bankers. The first intimation received by the plaintiff of the existenoo of any mortgage u a the property was in Jnne, 1856, when the defendant CXr calUed upon the plaintiffs 'present solicitor and inquired about the mortgage secarity given to him sad Cheslyn Hall two or three Sears previously. The r ddhad been found among the papers of Hall aiterade bankruptcy, and the defendants had commenced an action against the plaintiff uw hthe covenant,i restraint of wvhich and to obtaianacancelltion of the deed the plaintiff had filed his bill Mr. ClLanSS and Mr. SuIutAus, for the plaintiff, contended that the defendant Turner could not rely upon the deed as against the plaintiff, who had never received the money in respect of which the action was now pending, and bad never the smallest intention of mortgaging his property to Hall at a time when all0 was indebted to him in the amount of nearly 50,0001. The whole transaction was affected by the fraud practised by Hall, while Turner was legally fixed with the knowledge that Hall, as his agent, ha never paid over the alleged mortgage money to the plaintiff. Mr. CAiNs and Mr. ELDERTOx, for the defendant Turner, contended that the plaintiff was estopped by his deed, and could not restrain tho exercise of a clear legal right to sue in respect of the covenant by showing that he had himself been negligent and that fraud had been prac. tised by Hall, in which Turner admittedly had no part. The VIcE-CiANcELLoR, without calling for a reply, said that this very unfortunate case had arisen entirely out of the scandalous fraud practised by Choeslyn HalL as to whom, as be had been struck off the 1olls, it was unnecessary to make any further observation. The defendant, Turner, his co-trustee, had been deceived byhis representationsas tohis desire of investing, and the plaintiffs desire of raising the particular amount upon moitgage. It was clear uDon the evidence that the plamntiffgave no authorityto Hall, and that there was no agency subsisting between them as to this mort. gage transaction. The defendant, Turner, entrusted the trust money to Hall upon this false representation before the deed was executed. all got possession of the money, which he had retained, nor was there any pretence for saying that the money had been advanced upon the execution of the mortgage deed. The security was obtained by fraud, and consequently it was no security and could not be enforced, It was to be observed that the only attesting witness to the receipt of the money endorsed upon the mortgage deed was HllU himself, one of the mortgagees-certainly a most unusual circumstance and sufficient to have excited suspicion. No man could be allowed to obtain a benefit by the fraud of another, and the only question in the case had been whether the defendant Turner had been so misled by the negligence of the plaintiff as to entitle him to stand upon th seurity. He was of opinion that there had been no such misleading, and there must be a decree for the plaintiff with cts.
COURT OF OTWAFN'R W RP.7Vt( Wm,,,w- - , THE OUXRT V T-TP .-iT,q'TrQ -P O T (&Uingt in Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and Justices COLnRxnaS, ERLE, and OR1rMPTON.) In this cane the Court had granted a rale callig upon the Justices of Glocsetershire to show cause why a mandamus should not Issue comnmanding them to order payment of certain fees to Mr. Gaisford, one of the coroners for the county. The application was made in order to try the question whether the justices were justified in refusing to pay the coroner his fees, as they had done in several c'ases whersquests had been, as they alleged, unnecessarily held. two caues only were relied upon when the rule was moved. In the firt case the coroner had travelled 16 miles to hold an inquest on a woman, aged 60, who had been found lying dead upon the floor of her own house. She had not been attended by any mo edical man, nor was she known to be suffering from any disesas previous to her death, and the jury found that she had died from nataral causes by the viitation of God. In the other case the coroner had travelled 11 miles to hold an inquest on a child, aged 16 raomths, which had been scaldedh to death, whenx the jury found that the child haa died by a " accidental salding." In both oases the coroner had received his information of the death from the constable. The maegtates in seesions, havn considered the matter, disallowed the coroner's fees in bohof these cases, but they allowed hinm his mileage and other disbursements, in accordance with a decision of this Court, in " Reg. v'. The Justices of Carmarthenshire "1(10 Q. B., 796), in which it had been held that the coroner was entitled to his expenses, even when the inquest had been unnecessarily held. Mr. Serjeant BYLEs and Mr. SKiNNER nowshowed cause against the rule, and contended that the justices had pro. perly disallowed the fee for these two inquests. By the statute the 25th oDf George IL, chap. 29, sec. 1, for every inquest which shall be "1duly taken" the coroner was entitled to a fee of 20s. and mileage; and by the 7th of William IV. and lst of Victoria, chap. 68, see. 8, be was entitled to a sum of 6s. Sd. for every inquest held by him, over and above all other fees and allowances to which by law he was entitled. It had been held by this Court, in "Rl~v. the Justime of Rent" (11 East, 229), that it was for the justices to decide whether the iniquest had been. duly taken ; and, as the justices ha examined the coroner, and were satisfied that there was no ground for holding thie inquest, they contended this Court would not review their decision. Sir F. THrsxGant and Mr. W. PAYNX supported the rule, and contended that, as the coroner had been set in raotion by the constable, he was bound to hold the inquests, and so was entitled to his fees ; and, wvith respect to the additiona allowanee of 6e. 3d., given by the 7th of William IV. and thre st of Victoria, they contended that by the words of that statutet the justices had no jurisdiction to disallow that pay. ment. The learned counsel pressd to bave the rule made absolute as to both the charges, as it was the wish of the partiles interested to raise the question as to whether 'he lustcechad he owerwhih thy nw exerciged of disallwin th fes. her wa a enealmovement going oni thrughut he ounry gaist oroers wih aview to the disalownce f fes, henIt ws fund hatthe parties LordC~asprs,nsai tht s fa asthe coroner's fee -of 8s d. -was concerned doubt enough was raised to justify tho Court in granting a mansdamnus. But as to the fee of 20s., that was awarded by the 25th of George IEL onlywhen the Inquest was "1duly taken," of which the Legisliture had mnade the justices the judges. It was the duty of the justics not imerely to see whether the inquest was taken accrding to the formns of law, but whether it had been " duly taken," -i. &, whether the coroner had exercised a~e dis- they ad ated airlyand onesly, hejad hel, it taki tht te cronr rceidkn propr recmpense where he perfectly discharged his dut ; but they would, at the sae time, take care to withhold the fee where they tbought he had gone beyond Wu duty, and held an inquest where there was no necessity. This had been solemnly decided 40years ago in the case of "L. v. the Justices of Rent" and so late as 1847, when the same point was raised, the Court, after taking time to cosider, unanimously gave judgment in which they adopted the rule laid dowu in " R. v. the Justices of Kent." With respect to the general question hb Lordship said it was the duty of the jus. taces to consider whether there was a reasonable ground for holding the incquest; and, unless the corcner had actod meM flde, hisLordshipthoughtthefee oughttobealowed. But there vere cases, suen as that refeired to in the argument, where a certain nobleman came to a lamentable end, in which the coroner must have known there was no reasonable ground for holding an inquest; and in such cases the justices would do well to withold the fee, and thus give a necessary check to charges which would otherwise occur. The btIer judges expressed themselves to the same effect Mr.Justice BELE added that he was not in the habit of giving praise where it was not due, but he thought the Court of Quarter Sessions wae a most satisfactory tribunal in a large majority of the cses -which came before it. TEH QUE17 V. SIR EDWAmD CONBROY, BART. in this case the Court had granted a rule calling upon Sir Edward Conroy, Bart., a magistrate for the county of Berks, to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against him. The rule was granted on the application of Mr. George Barker, who is a magistrate of the same county, residing at Hurst. After stating at consider. able length the circumstanoes out of which a difference had 5risen between him (Mr. Barker) and Sir Edward Conroy, Mr. Barker stated that on the 2Mst of April last he attended the petty sessions at Wokingham, and there met Sir Edward Conroy and several other magistrates. 31n the course of the business both Mr. Barker and Sir Edward Conroy signed an order of bastardy, after which Sir Edward Conrovleft the court in company with two of the magistrates. In about half an hour he returned, and while Mr. Barker and three other magistrates were titting on the bench holding the petty sessions there, and in the actual exercise of their offiee, Sir Edward Conroy, interrupting the business, asked to see the order which he had that day signed. On its being handed to him Sir Edward Conroy said, "Isee the signature of Mr. Barker to this order and my own and then, addressing himself to the other magistrates, he added, " Now, gentlemau, as I do not consider Mr. Barker a gentleman, I will not have may name attached to any order or paper with his name, or act with him in any way or matter whatever," or words to that effect. He said that the clerk, seeing the violence of Sir Edward Conroy's conduct, then desired the strangers to leave the justice-room, upon which Sir Edward Conroy said, " Mr. Barker is not a safe person to act within anything," and he then took a pen and erased his signature from the order. Major Court, the chairman of the petty sessions, also made an affidavit, in which he coufirmed Mr. Barker's statement that the magistrates were inthe actual exe;cise of their office and duties as magistrates, when Sir Edward Conroy returned and made the above statement; and he also added that he and his brother magistrates were very much astonished at the same, and endeavoured to calm Sir Edward Conroy, &c. The Court granted the rule upon the ground that if a stranger had made use of such words to a magistrate while in the discharge of his duty he would have been gauilty of a misdemeanour, and that it was not less a misdemeanour because tne words were used by a magistrate. Mr. H. ErLn, Q.C., and Mr. FoRsTscux now showeed cause against the rule, and produced an affidavit made by Eir Edward Conroy, in which he expressed his regret that he should have acted hastily and on the impulse of the moment, as he had done; but that he should not have said a single word if he had not believed that the business of the magistrates was over, and that the remainig magistrates were talking together merely as private gentlemen. They contended, secondly, that, whatever opinionlmight be formed of Sir Edward Conroy's conduct on that eocasion (the 21st of April), the prosecator was disentitled to the special interference of the Court, upon the ground that he had given great provocation, and at a vestry meeting, hela at Hurst on the 13th of the same month, had treated Sir Edward Conroy with great rudeness and insult, and had accused him of duplicity and falsehood. po.nthe first point Sir Edward Conroy in his affidavit used these words:-- I cannot undertake to wear to the pre!su e words I made e of. buIt s lI Intended to exress wwa that in consquence of Mr. Barker', conduet tho se. which I ooaIdered unlike that at a gfntiemau, and bis nisrepresentation of my woers and aemi,,,, and hits alfing ost I pesons only created in his own mind. I did not conshder him a safe man to adt with, and that theretmre I withrew my name omn the Paid order, and further directed %he paid Mr. Roberta (the cierk) not to bring any more Order fOr me to sign to which theEa d Mr. Basher's name was attachecd.' He aded. "I Pay that in so doing I acted thotily and on the impube of the moment, hot not violeatly or Pa'sionately, being perfectly cool, but oonoeiving each a step neces-. sar for toy own protecti, and without ay Premeditated intention of actin-' offensively to the said Mr. Burker. more especially while In the dir.ioars of his ftntclnos as magistrate; and that I swuld n c t have said a sngle word, had I not believed that all the baealnes of the meeting wa over, and that the emadtbnng magistrates prseet were onoterang together as private gentlemeon," 'eawnt on to state that, though snob was stil his belief, the had ever since deeply regretted the hasty step." Lord CA31PBELL.-That might be because he had got into a bad scrape. oMr. HILL proceeded to sate that Sir Edward Couroy rehvetted the hasty step he had taken IIunder feebing of avied beefowronged and insulted " and that bee tese K=.*dinD were commenced he had plcegd himself in the hns of Captain Leveson, Gower and two other moagis. trats, and authorized them to adopt whatever oour they thought proper on his behalf.

The learned counsel also read the affidavits of Mr. R. Gibson and p o r. J.TJ. Balkeley, two other justices who were present, to the same effect, and stating their belief that tho buiness was all over, and that the magistrates were talking together on ordinAry tn tBe caours of the discussion, Lord CAMaBFLL several times interposed, with a view to bnrng about some arrangement of the dispute between the parties, but without effect. His Lordship at this stage expressed an opinion that, as the justicesn were stir stting on the bench, it was, at all events, doubtful whether they rouno tobe considered as in the exercise of their Office. r HILL then proceeded to contend that Mr. Barker, by lis condluct and the provocation which he had g en to Sir Edward Conroy had disentitled himself to call Mor the interference of the Court, andl ought to be left to his remedy by inidictment. The learned counsel produced as many asq 19 amf. davitsin support of this part of his case. These affidavits wer made by peomns who were present at the vestry meeting held. at Hurst on the 13th of April. and they in substance m,tated that Mr. Barker contradicted what Sir Edward Con. roy had represented to have takeni place at Mr. J. Walter's, at BearwGod, on the Ist of February. The parties considered Mr. Barker's conduct and manner towards Sir Edward Conroy as "1rude and provoking," net so much so in direct words as in tone and manner; and thiey considered that Mr. Barker euadeavoured to make it appear to the meeting that Sir Edward Conroy had not confined himself to the trth as to what passed at the house of Mr. Walter.

It appeared from the affidavits on which the learned counsel moved that the applicant, Mr. Wm. Bedale, is the proprietor of two hackney carrages, and that recently the company has allowed certain cabs of Clarke to stand npon their station stand, to the exclusion of the applicant's carriges, Clarke p,ying 6001. a-year for the privilege. The learned counsel referred to the case of "Marriott v. the South-Western Railway Company," and to "Barker v. the Midland Railway Comany," as authorities for his appli- The COURT were of opinion that there was no ground for the application.

The defendant pleaded "nNot Gnuity," and that the van was not the property of the plaintiff. It appeared, from the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff, that he, being a carter and van proprietor, had entered into a contract with the defendant, a cart and van builder to the effect that the plaintiff was to have a van from th defendant, and pay 2. lOs. per month for 16 months, and at the end of that-period he was to pay a further sum of 41., when the van was to become his property.

It was proved that the prisoner had been in the habit of coDecting orders for advertisements, &e., receiving 8s. per week and a commi3sion. He was discharged a short time since, and on the 20th of May a young man, answering the prisoner's description, went to the Temple-bar branch of the 0ndon and Westminster Bank, and applied for "a new check-book for Mr. Barton," prGducing a vritten order for it, purporting to be in his late emplovers' handwriting. The check-book was handed to the applicant, hlr. Barton having an account at the bank, and from this tille a number of forged checks for various amounts were circulated amon the tradespeople having busianess with Mr. Barton. In each case the prisoner contrived to get a considerable amount of change, besides the article purchased with the check, and it was stated that 40 of these checks had been used; the remainder were found in the prisoner's possession when he was apprehended. the prisoner, instead of meeting the charge asinst him, lrocoecdato abuse his late employers and their mode of onducting bu3ines3, and, on being asked to account for his possesion of the b]ank check-book, said it was given to him byas btetting man" under circumtances which he should Mr. Exienr remanded him for further examination to Sarah Kennard, chared with stealing waterproof cape from M r.

It was clearly proved by several witnesses that the defendant was in the habit of attending daily at an alehou3e inaBisho0sgate-street, where, as alleged, on behalf of the landlord, he gave advice, received bets, and carried on this kind of business to such an extent that, as ona witnes alone stated, he saw no lesB than about 30 bets tendered and accepted by him within the space of two hours that he steod there. The Police Commissioners at length interposed to puta stop to the practice, and tle landlord and others having been secured, together with all the requiEsites for transacting matters of that ind, the landlord was fined heavily and paid the penalty, the others being discharged for want of evidence. A warrant was then issued for the apprehension of the defendant, who for sonm time could not be discovered by the police, bat he at length surrendered, was admitted to hail, and now, as above stated, appeared for sentence. Mr. Beard, who attended for the defence, made a srong appeal to the Bench on behalf of his client, whom he ze garded, in fact as an object of commiseration rather thn otherwise as not only had he been merely a subordinate agent in these transactions, not deriving the chief benefit himseLf from them, but he had been in some measue, it appeared, compelled to adopt them from having a wife and fivechildren entirely dependentuponhim, andhadforsome time past also been in snoh a wretched state of hedath to obI is becoming at ast an inmate of St. Mr. L Ticox ws willing to take these Circumstances into oonsideration as far as he could, but it must be upon the express stipulation thatthe defendsant enAtirely refrained f onX such prachices inj future, and uponA that bei2g agreed to (which both the defendant and his solli3tor at once did), he should mitgate thie penalty to 5L., or, in default, samointh'. imprisonment in the Hl4ouse of Correction, Cs.znvmx'oa-Jhol Symonds. a wood sawyer, wa placed at the bar before 3Mr. ConitiE, in the custody of Robert Lambert, 135 S, one of the warrant officers of the court, charged with brutally kicking and ilMtreating Sarah Ricketts. When the woman got into the witness-box her fce, which seemed almost beaten out of shape, and was one mass of braises and almost of every colour, togetur with her general appearance, excted great comussera tion. She stated that she lived with the prisonleT, and on Monday last, about half-past 8 oeclock in the evening, he came home about half-an-hour before his usual time, and because his supper was not edhe began to i'Muse her in the most brutalmanner.W, knocked her about the head and face till she almnost lost %te use of her eyes, but not content with this illtreatment when she was lying on the ground, he licked hler onoe ot twice. She had been so ill ever since that it was not until yesterday afternoon that she was weil enough to apply to this court. She had had two children by him, and two abe had yet alive by her late husband. The defendat bd before mllused her, but not to such an extent as now. Robert Lambert, 135 S, said that when he went to serve the warrant he found the defendant in bed drunk. The room was bespattered with blood in several places. Ue found that the prisoner, his wife, and the complainant, all resided together on the same floor. The wife of the prisoner had been ill for some considerable period, and the woman haddone the household duties, and had alsohad two children by him. Mr. CosRRi.-What I The man cohabit with the woman in the same room as his wife was lying ill I Defendant.-We aU lived together. The complainant was in the habit of getting drank. Mr. COrxE remarked that it was quite shocking to hear of such a state of immorality. Row many children were there? CompLainant.-I have twoalive by myformer husband, and two since I have cohabited with the defendant. His wife has been lll for a long period, and I have lived with them.

He was now very sorry, and said that nothing of the sort should occur again. Complainant.-I do not wish to hurt him; all that I want is for him to keep the peace. I have been struck by hisa before. Mr. ConnB said, that this case was very bad in every point of view. He could not be lenient, but must pas upon the defendant such a sentence as would be a terror to other evildoer He should send him to the House of Correction, with hard labour, for six calendar months. He would allow the woman 8s. per week for one month. He supposed the wife would have to go to the workhouse. The prisoner, who eemed rather surprised, was then removed.

Mr. Cornelius Delay, a bootmaker, living at No. 29, Butler's-buildings, Upper EAst Smithfield, was passiug along Ratdliff-highway, opposite Ship-alley, on Saturday evening, while the prisoner saddenly accosted him, struck him, and when he was staggeringfrom the effects of the blow snatie6d his watch from his wAstcoat pocket and broke the chain in doing so. The prisoner immediately fled with the watch, and was pursued by the prosecutor, who caUed out "Stop thief !" A polce-constable, No. 122 H, who heard the cry of "Stop thief v" wasabout to intercept the prisoner when another man stopped him aud gave him into the custody of a policeman. The prosecutor came up quite breathiess directly afterwards, and charged the prisoner with stealing his watch. The prisoner maid, "I have not got it; I am not the man. A girl named Mary Lynch, to whom the prisoner had given the watch in the course of the pursuit, came up with it and handed it to the constable. It was produced and identified by Mr. Delay, who said it was worth 61. The prisoner said he never had the watch, and never gave It to te girl Lynch.

NotToN, on a charge of burglariosly breaking into the dwelling-house of Miss Elizabeth Crow, 13, Crosby-row, Walworth-roaLd, and stealing therefrom three shawls and other valuable articles. Sergeant James Nightingale, 12 P, deposed, that at about 4 o'clock on that morning he stopped the prisoner in the Camberwell New-road, carrying the bundle of property he then produced, and, as he could not give a satisfactory account of its possession, nor even a proper description of the goods, he took him into custody, and soon after heard thata burglary and robbery had taken place at a house in the Walworth-road. On taldng the prisener from the station-house to the Comut on that morning he said they should soon come to the house from which the goods had been taken, and on reaching the house of the prosecutor he, witnes askedhim if that was it, and theprisoner replied that it was.

REGISTRATION OF TI.TL TO *AND.* lf the result ot the report on thie subject not, Vresented to Parliament affords anyeaccurate test of the difficulties attending the introduction of a plan for the Registration of Title to Land, the hesitation of sacce3swe Governments in maki-ng the attempt to produce one is completely justilied. In 1853 a select committee of the House of Commous wai appointed to investigate the matter, and the members of that committee reported, not only that it was not then possible for them " to present a scheme in an embodied form," but that they did not even " feel confident that they had ascertained all the diffieulties which might attend its practical operation," and they suggested the appointment of a coasie3ion. The suggestion was acted on; and Mr. Walpole, Mr. Napier, Sir A. Cockburn (Attorney-Gleneral% 1Sir R. E,ethell (Solicitor-General), T. E. Readlasa, Q.C., Vincent Scully, Q.C., Robert Lowe (Viee-President of the Board of Trade), W. D. Lewis, Henry Drummond, John Evelyn Denison (the present Speaker of the House of Commctns), R. Wilson, and WV. S. 'Cookson, Esqs., were isJanuary, 1854, appointed commissioners. Assuming-vwhich is, however, ldghly improbable (for Sir R. Bethell's name is s!gned to the report)-that neither the Attorney nor Solicitor-General took any active part in the lubours of the comnmission, there were still 10 gentlemen by whom the subject has been most carefuUy considered. And what is the result? A report occupying nearly 49 pages of a blue-book, which Mr. Wilson does not siga at all, and which, though signed by theother commissioners(the present Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas excepted), is accompanied by " memorandiuns" of dissent from no less than three of their number. And these dissents relate, as it will be seen, to no unimportant part. of the subject, but rather to one in which principle and detail are so mixed together that the memorandists can hardly be said to agree with their brother commissioners in anything beyond a zealous recommendation that there should be some registration. The commissioners began their investigation not wholly unfettered. The select committee, assuming that some system of registration was necessary, had proceeded on the principle contained in a " Bill for the Registration of Assurances," then before Parliament, which was that of " keeping the registered ownership wholly separate and apart from the ,equitable right or title." Why this separation was so earnestly recommended it is even now difficult to understand, but the committee when suggesting the appointment of a commission had declared the -opinion " that registration wiU be practicable and useful if effected upon this principle." The commissioners seem, therefore, to have fancied themselves bound to favour, if not actually to adopt, the principle which had thus received the approval of the committee. By the majority it has been adopted-by the minority it is considered at least inexpedient; and there seems good reason for believing that the opinion of the minority will be that which the publio will adopt. But before proceeding to criticize the report let us take some of its recommalendations and the reasonings in their favour. The report begins by affirming the advantages to be derived from registration of the ownership of land, and declares that " they have been for a Long time very generally admitted." It must be assumed, therefore, that difficulties of detail have alone prevented the country from enjoying the benefit of these advantages, the more especially as it is remarked that " in the earlier periods of our history publicity was considered essential in almost all dealings with landed property," and when that publicity came to be partially disregarded uncertainty of titles arose, and in the reign of Charles II. this uncertainty of titles was deemed to be " one cause of the decay of rents and value of lands." It does not appear, however, that registration has been wholly neglected in this country, and many persons will, doubtless, be surprised to find how many Acts have been passed enforcing in one matter or another the necessity for registration. The commissioners say:- "17. Various systems and methods of registration are found actually existing in practice for the protection of the title to landed and other property. The pebuliarities and incidents of these different systems we tnink it netessary to bear in mind in the investigation of the subject before us. " The various kinds of registry or modes of registration t-) which we refer differ materially in their objects and their extent, and may be distinguished as follows:- *1. A register of incumbrances and securities for debt; as, the registers of judgments (established in 1692 by the 4th and 5th of Williaia and bfary, chap. 20, and since varied and extended by the 1st and 2d of Victoria, chap. 110, and the 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 11, and the 18th and 19th of Victoria. chbp. 15) ; grants of annuities (established in 1777 by the 17th of George Ill., chap. 26, and varied and improved by the 53d of George III., chap. 141, subsequently repealed by the Act abolishing the laws relating to usury, the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 90, but restored in an amended form by the 18th and 19th of Victoria, chap. 1-5, sec. 12); 'warrants of attorney (established in 1822 by the 3d of Georgc IV., chap. 39, extended by the 6th and 7th of Victoria, c ap. 66)- crown debts and recognizances (established in 1839 by the 2d and 3d of Victoria, chap. 11, secs. 8 and9): and cases of Us pendeas (established ia 1839 by the 2d and 3.d of Victoria, chap. 11, sec. 7). " 2. A register or enrolment of particular classes of deeds, or deeds having particular objects-as, the enrolment of deeds of hargain and sale (established in 1535 by the statuto 27th of Henry VIIL, chap. 16); disentailing assurances. or deeds executed for barring estates tall (established in 1833 by the 3d and 4th of Willi.m IV., chap. 74, sec. 41); and bills of sale of personal chattels capable of delivery (established in 1854 by the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 86). "3. A regiser of memorials, or brief abstracts of deeds and insoruments-as, th registers of meamorials of deeds and wills affecting lands in Ireland (establiihed in 1707 by the Irish statute 6th of Anne, chap. 2), and in the counties of Middlesex (established as to the several ridings in the years 1703, 1707, and 1735 by the statutes 2d and 3d of Anne, chap. 4, statute 6th of Anne, chap. 35, and statutte 8th of George I., chap. 6), and York (established in the year 1708 by the statute 7th of Anne, chap. 20). " 4. An enrolment of the deeds themselves, or full copies of them. and extending to all deeds-as, the enrolment of deeds affecting lands in the Bedford level (established in f6,3 by the Act for draining the Bedford level, 15th of Charles II., chap. 17, sec. 8). 5o. A register of the title or actual ownership, independently of the past transactions or deeds by which it has been acquired. "Such is tbe register in the books of the Bank of England of the public stocks and funds." It has often been said, with reference to codifying the law, that the decisions of the courts furnish the materials for framing an easy and a simple code if there existed but the practical good sense to turn them to account, a saying with which we are much inclined to agree, believing that "vwhere there is a will" to fancy difficulties in the way of such a proce,ss, "there is sure to be away" of dscovering,if not creating, them, No walls are more easily stumbled against than those which men build for that especial purpose; and by some unfortunate accident thi, sort of process has been, in relation to schemes for Law Reform, going on for many years with many persons in this country, but especially with the Oriminal Law Commissions. To whose fault this is owing it is not now our business to inquire, but it is to be feared that their unfortunate example is spreading to other Commissioners. We are at present, however, dearmg with the registration of title to land, and, after this 8hort digression, we resume the strict course of our labours. It aeems, then, that we have long had registrations of matters which affected land, but not registration of title to land. The groundwork of a complete system has, therefore, beesi laid. Why is it that these parts of it have failed to give security to piurchasers and satisfaction to the country? Precisely becanse the great connecting link between form and usefulness sI wAnng A - ma osse saeA hr xvswer8 .........e familyg cAne ma osse estate A ; there vere family charges upol it, there were mortgages, tbere were unsatisfied judgments, but there were no means by which any one asked to advance money on this estate, or any one who had just recovered a judginenit against the owner, could exactly and eaaily know the amount oI liabilities to which that estate was aubject. Several places had to be searched to discover even that information which various statutes bad declared should be preserved for the use of purebasers or creditors, and the difficulty of identifying the estate of the owner (in the strictly legal sense of that word-that is, not merely the substantive property, but the logal interest therein) with the various encumbrances which affected it, was considerable. There eould be nothing satisfactory -where very little was to be known in an authorita- tive form, and when even that which was known might be seriously affeted by what was kept secret. For, beside3 this difficulty in discovering enrolled deeds or registered judgments, and of applying what was so discovered to the proper estate, the're were y matters as to which the law did not reqaire re- stration, and with regard to them the veil of pri's'y was often the cover for fraud. Money hasbeen lent, deeds exhibited, and on the face of them a fair security has appeared to be offered to the lender, yet when he has attempted to enforce payment of his often-delayed interest, and to obtain repayment of overdue principal, other deeis have been produced, coming apparently from the custody of third and innocent persons, and, produced avowedly for the purpose of protecting their interests, but which-entirely defeated the claimn of the cheated mortgag,ee. It was no consolation to him to know that after losing principal, interest, and costs, he might, by consenting to waste more money, perhaps successfully prosecute the borrower for a fraud, and revenge, thou he could not repay, himself. Tt v/as tbis sort of case which, frequently occurring, bev'ot at last an urgent demand for a re,gistration of tine to land, and of all | the ascertained liabilities to which the land so registered was subject. Why that demand has been resisted or evaded so long, and why it is not even now proposed to be granted in completeness, is a curious question of political metaphysics. The defective law has cost the landowner money enough to make him disaDprove it. yet he adheres to it. By the confession of the Commissionera it adds to the amount of the interest demanded for a loan, and aggravates the amount of costs in the solicitor's bill. Covenants for title, covenants for production of deeds (sometimnes utterly incapable of being performed), and other expedients, are adopted in order to satisfy the fears of a lender and the skilful scruples of his legal advisers, and, after all, the security may be incomplete. The Registration Commiasioners fill more than two whole pages of the Report with the bare enumeration of the " Evils of the present state of the Law," and the evidence of some of the witnesses and.the opinions of some of the writers on the subject would almost make the public believe that any remedy for these evils was impossible. Thus many solicitors and Lord St. Leonard's (in his pamphlet "Shall we Register our Deeds ?") agree in declaring that no registration of assurance is possible, since the accumulation of deeds and instraments to be kept, searched, and examined would be overwhelhnin, some persons thinking that the incregse would be at the rate of 300,000 annually, or 1,000 a-day for every working day. We doubt the amount of this increase and its value as a reason for preventing the complete and uniform registration which we believe to be necessary. We shaUl discuss that question presently. The Registration Commissioners seem, however, to have been alarmed by this testimony, and they do not recommend a registration of assurances as united with and forming part of a registration of title. Their reasons for abstaining from doing so we shaU examine on another occasion, but we now proceed to the various " plans" which the commissioners have considered. The first of these plans may be consiaered (especially with relation to " land debentures") as substantially the plan of Mr. Scully- "XXVL The first of these plans proposes the establishment of a Land Tribunal, to which owners of land (includinr tenants for life and in tail, as well as in fee) may apply to nave the land placed upon a public register, and declared to be registered land. The Tribunal is to inquire into the nature of the applicant's title to the land and its existing circumstances, so as to decide upon the expediency of simpiy admitting it upon the register. When the land has thus become registered no subsequent act.is to create any new estate less than a fee simple, except registered leases or easements; nor any new incumbrance, except registered debentures to a limited amount. "The plan also proposes that the owner of such registered land may further apply for a full investigation of title, and for an order declaring, in a conclusive form, all existing estates and incumbrances; and that after the making of such order the tribunal may give to each person so found to be intexested a certificate of his title. It is also suggested that, in order to obviate all chance of any injustice to third parties, the State may guarantee the title, upon payment of such small fees or premiums of insurance as will provide an indemnity fund to componsate persons whose prior rights might be superseded; bQt this guarantee is not an essential portion of the p lan. " The privileges considered to be incident to this plan are:- "1. A Parliamentary or indefeasible title, when conelusively declared by the TribunaL 2. A power to transfer by simple entry the registered " 3. A further power to obtain on its credit terminable land debentures, transferable either by simple entry like Government stock, or by simple delivery like bank-notes or bills of exchange. "'With a view to impart to these debentures an irmmediate marketable currency, and consequent increase in value. their amount is to be limiited-say, for example, to 10'times the annual value of the land; and they are to be for uniform sums, without priority inter se, and bearing a similar rate of interest. The leading object of these debentures is to avoid the existing complexity of encumbrances, and gradually to supersede all other kinds of charge, such as mortgages, legacies, famUy portions, quit-rents, tithe rentcharges, annuities, judgments, recoguisances, Crawn bonds, decrees, orders, and rules of court. "' As to family settlements and trusts, it is suggested that they might still be sufficiently effectuated (like settlements of Government stock or of railway shares) through personal confidences and the equitable jurisdiction of the land tribunal; also that equitable mortgages or loans from bankers might be eflected easUy and without expense. The plan further recommends that the new systemshould be mntroduced gradually and in a voluntary form; though, after some years' experience of its benefical working, it might be considered expedient to render its application universal as to all land not specially exempted from its operation. "The professed prinoiple of the whole plan is to facilitate the sale and transfer of land, through the most simple machinery for the registration of an absolute title, both to the land itself and to the charges upon land; with a subsequent capacity in the owner of any registered land or charge to transfer the former by entry, the latter by entry or delivery:' As to this plan, the commissioners pronounce against the institution of a land tribunal, with judicial powers, to decide conclusively upon all titles to land, and they distinguish between the case of Ireland, where an actual necessity had arisen for judicial interference and the creation of a new proprietary, and this country, where no such necessity exists. They consider, also, that this plan is defective in not providing sufficient protection to beneficial and equitable interests.. They do not think the creation of land debentures a matter within the scope of their inquiry, even if the means existed in England as in Ireland (which they do not) for satisfactorily ascertaining the value of land. They are not, however, wholly unfavourable to thewarrantyof title, althoughwemust confess that this appears to us to involve rmatters even more difficult of arrangement, and liable to even more serious objections in principle as well as in practice, than the permission (properly restricted) to create land debentures. The second plan, which may be considered that of Mr. Wilson (the Oommissioner who has entirely abstained from signing the report) is thus summel up - " XXXI. The second plan which has been submitted to us is founded on a principle which was brought to the notice of the Registration and Conveyaucing Commissioners. It has been described, in a word, as registration of the froehold. This plan proceeds on the hypothesis that possession is the root of title; bearing in mind that by possession the posses,ion of the freehold is meant, and by freehold a presumptive fee simple. Credit, therefore, is given to poasession until it is shown to, be wrongfuL Thelact that theproperty is held bv the person who is seen to bold it is presumed to be coincident with the right of property, until the oostrary appears. Acting on this hypothesis, the freeholder as thus defined is always to be entitled to have' his property registered. But since there may be other rights besides the freeholder's, these rights are to be dealt with as qualifications of the freeholder's presumptive title, for the possession is not necessarily the whole of the evidence upon which the title rests; it should rather be considered as the basis of the evidence, or, as it were, the starting point of the inquiry. When, therefore, other rights excist, protection is to be given to thelm, and they are to he capable of regstrtion under the heads of ',Charges and Notices.' Registration of chages and noticesias to consist, in effect, of the regisTation of written instruments or assurances ; but each instrument or assurance is to stand nupon the regiter in the nlame of a person responsible for its introduction int or retntlioni the registered title, and empowered to remove it at pleasure; and provision is to be made for its compulsory removal from the title as soon as its operation has ceased. The registration of the freehold is to be provisional in the first instance, that time may be allowed -say six years ordinarily, but a louger od perhaps 20 years, for those who are under divabitfies to interpose the registration of existing encumbrances or adverse titles. It is further proposed that a map of sl the land in the kin dom, divided into hapies or districh should be made by authority, on vwieclh each field or other materially defined portion of the surface of the country should be distinguished by a numerical symboL This map is to be made the basis of a book of ref ere coontaining the same numbers as those on the map, with the desription and contents of eaoh division, and the names and'addresee of the different freeholders. The register at the outset would be formed on the spot by an assistant registrar or commizs sioner-sext.down to the different parisbes for the purppo* of receiving claims - and the assistant registrar would in isub sauce follow tne practice prescribed by the iGenera In closure Act 8th and 9th Victorias chap. 118. a limited time being aCgowed for appeals, with an extension of time inz favour of persons undcer disabiitie" The Commissioners' objections to this plan. refer chiefly to practicalmattergs but ertainly matters of such importance as would render the plan, if the objctions are well founded at least yverydifficult o' execution. They also 8ay r ' dinf'cult ;. ' One serious objection is s&thenesaityof aending ~a 0cm. mission into Vz,ry district qasetanho axe -t be pu rtS eterZ ofrhe m its . fin that d tlc,aoi Kjeti principle of sach an inquiry. It would, in feat, involve a compulsory registration of title, for a landowner could not venture to remain passive, lest some one else shouldprocure registration to his prejudice. The presumptive competeness. attributed to the freehold title would also tend to stir up dorsipautclaimswwhichmightotherwi6e be settled byrmere lapse of time. In tha next place, the right which uuder such a syastem every freeholderiwould have to register his freeho.ld, as iu,plyig,ln the ats8nee of or subject to regis. eterd qualifications, a power to transfer the ree simple to a bend ide purchaser fcc ialuable consideration, wouldeconfer on apere;en vith alisuited interestap owcrwuhich hie does . notnd ought not to posses. .The consequence must be that claims without number would be sent in to the registrar; for the presumptive right which. the freeholdet might acquire would otherwise destroy the actual rights which the remainderinen, or those who have interests in the property are justly entUtled to. In the next place, the facility with wvhich claimls migh; he m ade and allowred would lead to the introduction of a m.ss nfdocuments-some real, some doubtful, some fictitious -whica would have to be searched for, examined, and got rid of, before a purchaser could be advised to accept the registered title." As to the maps, the expense inevitable to the construction of snaps sufficient for such a purpose decides them at once that the adoption of this plan cannot be recommended. While referring to this subject, it is not out of place to remark that the Commissioners declare that their ressoning, founded on . the insufficiency of existing maps and the great expense of constructing others fit for the purpose, applies to England only, for that in Ireland the Ordnance maps, being six; inches to the mile instead of one inch to the mile, have been found amply sufficient. Poor deserted, ill-used Ireland seems in this, as in not a few other things, to have been better taken care of than England, and while England is refused the trial of a plan very much upon the ground of the enormous expense that would attend the experiment, the same objection is found not at all to apply to the sister country. While, however, hesitating to recommend the construction of a map o. this kind for England, the Commissioners declare that they are 4 notinsensible to the numeroius advantages which a pictorial representation of property and its boundaries must always have as compared with a mere verbal description of it." Is it not possible that the difficulty and expense have been exaggerated, and that there are other and less easily understood reasons against it? It seems so. Mr. Joshua Williams, in his evidence, says that "' a map is a good servant but a bad master; very useful as an. auxiliary, but very mischievous if made indispensable." This is one of those fine sayings of the antithetical Ind lwhich (with due deference to the Commissioners who approve it) seems equally deficient in poetical allegory and in practical good sense. The third plan, which seems to be more particularly attributable to Air. Cookson, but not to be his exclusively, is thus described:- " The next plan which has been b.rought before us is that which was previously submitted to the select committee of the House of Commons. This plan is founded on the belief that the transfer of land may for many purpcses be assi-ailated to a transfer of stool Every person who, in respect of power or interest, hbs the absolute right of disposing of the fee simple of property in land would, according to this plan, be entitled to put the estate on the register, and to transfor the ownership thereof to any other person, s5h. ject to such rights and interests as were created befote and existed at the time when the registration of the pro. perty was effected. And inasmuch as this part of the plan would be slow in its operation, and for 50 or 60 years would involve an investigation of title anterior to the registry in every dealing with the land subsequent to the registry, it is proposed that the person seeking registration should be empowered to apply to the registrar to have the title duly investigated by a counsel and solicitor of his own selection; and then, if the title should be found in all respects to be perfectly marketable, the registrar is to be authorized to guarantee or warrant it against all claims that might be brought in respect of it. But since persons having lialited interests might be projudiciaUy affected by the acts of the registered owner, it is likewise proposed to enable such per. sons to protect themslves by the eatry of distringases, to be obtained and to operate in the same way as stop orders are now obtained and operate on the transfer or disposition of stock in the funds. A similar mode of registration is likewise provided, by means of a subordinate register for leaseholders. This plan does not provide for the registry of anything beyond the simpie transfer of the ostensible, ownerbhip in fee and leases. Dealings which concern partisl estates or equitable interests only will not be assisted orprotected by the register, except when (as agaiust an improper disposition by the registered owner) a distringas is put on. In fact, the purpose of this plan is to attach to each landed estate a formnal and ostensible poprietorshipj to which the right of sale and transfer tmat eitncidet, in cases where the whole fee simple is intended to edisposed of, and to remit those who in any eiTse atey have right to restrainis e sale or transfer, or to complain of it, or aire interested in its proceeds, to the pro. tecin of the dowtngaer or to their personal claim against tbe individual." The objections to thi8 plan are stated so briefly that it will he as well to give them ibe the very words of the comrissioners:- " The material objection to this plan is that transfers by the registered owner are stopped or prevented sot long as there are mortgages on the property protected by distringes, and that mortgsgeee must either be themselves placed on the register as owners in lieu of their mortAnother ormitbjecotn wih the protection of a distring,as. Another objection is that a general liberty of entering distringases on the oath of parties, stating that they have an interest in the land, and on an ex Parte order of the Coart of Chancery, may lead to complications, embarrassments, and litigation which ought to be avoided. Some further check may perhaps become necessary to prevent this liberty from being abused, and wn believe such check may be fonnd and provided. "It is also considered by some of the commissioners that the advantages to be derived from registration would under this plan be postponed to too retuote a period, unless some means could be devised of ascertaining and protecting on the register, within an early period, rtights in registered land created anterior to the registry. " The principal change in the law which this plan involves is that after the commencement of the registry no disposition by a registered owner will be allowed to pass any interest less than the whole fee simple, except leases. The transfer must vest an absolute proprietorship in the transferee, whether the parpose of the transfer be a sale, a mortgage, or a settlement." Several other plans were suggested, and the author of one of them, Ar. E. N. Ayrton, has very recently embodied his ideas upon the subject in a pamphlet entitled Suggestioas for an Act to give an inzdefes.siblc Titte in Land. They are all ser forth in the Appendix to the R neport, but are not mt le the subject of detailed observation by the comnmissioners. All these plans agree that, as to title, the entry in the register shall be the only manifestation of actual ownership for the purposes of transfer, and also that there should be some registration of titlewhat that is to be was the matter which the commissioners deemed it their duty to discover, and as to one point they all seem to entertain the same opinion-namely, that no good system of registration can be introduced without some changes being made in the law of real property itself. Their own statement of the problem they are called on to solve is this *- " By what means consistently with the preservation of existing rights can we now obtkia such a system of registration as will enable owners to deal with land in as simiple and easy a manner, as far as the title is concerned and the difference in the nature of the subject matter may pllowv as they now can deal with moveable chattels or stock I" The first question that here suggests itself is whether this problem can ever be satisfactorily solved so long as thecommnissioners fancy themselves bound to act only wthin the limits of that "principle" which the ielect committee of 1853- auggested. This diffiaMlty meets us as it met thera at every stage of the inquiiry. They say, however, that- "The objects in view are to form a register of title as distinguished from a register of the various deeds aad a-snrsnces under which the title has been derived; to form this register in such a manner that the retrospective inquiry into the former dealings and transactions, which on a trausfer is now necessary, may be avoided; to make this register iustrernetal in simplifying generally the title to land and the fora,s of -conveyance; and at the seine timne to continue,.as far as possible consistently writh a simaple register of title, tbhe,esting ysm of settle ments, and to avoid imnpairing unduly the security of settlements and trusts. These objects, moreover, we consider ought to be accomplished. if : posible in a manner wvhich will avoid the special abjections mcdehti Io a system of registration of assurances, bat at the same time will secure the particular benefits and atvantages which, as we have stated, belong to that system." Laying down these rules for their guidance in their task, they first coinsider whether registratioa shall be compulsory or not, aid the conclusion they come to is that, in the first instance, registration ,shall not be compulsory; secondly, thgy think that ajudicial title should not be a preliminary to registration, -which might be founded on ostensible or posessory ownership in the first instance; thirdly, '"though with' some difference of opinion," that interests created in land before the commencement of registration should not. be adversely bound or, taffected' by the mere registration as such,, but should be alUowed to be claimed, notwithatand- edg the registration within the period now fixed by the Statute of Limitations; foutrhly. they consider "wwhether registration of the legal ownerhip- will be cimEpatible with dtue 'pro'tection of the equitable or beneficial interests, in land" and thongh they do not give their sdlution of tins qtuestion ira form of words, ai their reason-' ing goes'to show tsatthey think the question might. beanswrered in the . i~ffirmative. ~ Th; - point w.ill assuredl form,the aut-debkteab]e' ground'of any! mneasure-fo le- on their tporte ai=d iu 11o0h.zt article we Bhall abstract the--Teasons for their opinionl, and then discus those reasons, The question of a central ofice, or numerous county offices, ie then debated, and the preference given in the fia8t instance to the former. - In time both may become necessary, but the metroDitan office as absoluteiy inevitable, lunless the Mettled habits of business of the country could at once be chanlged. * The leading -particulars of the registration recommended are thus stated: "LIL A land register and transfer office for England and Wales wiU be established in London under the snanasement of a Registrar-General, and branch offices will be also established in different districts throughout the kingdom. shbject to the orders and regulated by the authority of the Registrar-General. " LIIM The registration w-l extend to al corporeal hereditaments, except cop)holds, and to advowsons and rentcharges, except, perhaps, tithe rent-charges. " LIV. Af er the establishment of the ofiee all owners or proprietors of land who have the right of possessing or the power of disposing of it in fee simple wiU be at liberty to apply for the registration of the ownership thereof; so that such ownership, or the ti'le to the land which is the subject of the same, may thenceforth be manifested by the register alone. i1 Supposing this to be accomplished safely and with pradence, the effect of the register, when in complete operation, will be to rendor it unnecessary, in dealing with land -which has so been registered, to look beyond the las' ownezship appearing on the register. j LV. Registration of title is proposed to be twofold; one which shall at once enable the registered owner to transter Ihe estate with a present or immediate statntory title; the other registration of actual ownership, without the power to transfer an immediate statatory title. " LVIL In the second of these cases, that is, in the case of registration unattended with immediate statutory I ti;le, the parties applying will be required to produce I before the registrar a declaration on oath, stating that they are in the aotual enjoyment of the rents and proites, and that they believe themselves to be absolutely entitled to the land in fee simple free from all i incumbrances, or subject only to such incumbrances as are distinctly specified; and they wiU also be required to produce, where it can be done, the last instrument of con. veyance of the fee aisuple, or such other evidence as the registrar may fLd it necessary to require, with the view of excluding fraudulent claims. Powers also will be conferred on the registrar to give such public and other notices as he rmay deem necessary of the intention of the parties to havo the property registered, in order that they maynot wrong. fully procare a registration which may be detrimental to other persons. " sBut where the title to lands has been asertained by decree or Judgment of any court whose jurisdiction is com;patent to determine the right, there the production of such decree or judgment by the person in whose favour it may have been made, or the order of the Court consequent thereon,'will alone be sufficient to authorize the registrar to register the ownership of such person, subject to the necessity of making such declaration and serving such notices as above adverted to. "1 LVIL Registration with immedia'e statutory title will take place in those cases where the owner of land desires not only to obtain a title which, with regard to the futura, wil be manifested and esta- lished by the register alone, but a title which with regard to the past, cannot be disturbed. In this class of eases it will be lawful for the parties seeking registration with the benefits of a warranted ownership to apply to the registrar to have the title investigated vith that object. In such cases it will be right that the registrar !honld cause the title to be fully investigated, at the expense of the parties, by counsel and solicitors; and if he shall be sahsned on their advice that the title is a good one, then, I on the payment of a small premium, to be calculated by way I °f a percentage upon the estimated value of the property II question, he will register the ownersbip as a warranted I oi e, either in the name of the party applying, or, if the party applying shaU prefer it, then in the name of such p÷rrons as he may nominate for that purpose. Since the ;guarantee of the title wiU be given by a public efficer, the premiums payable by the party obti ining such guarantee will he paid into the i xehequer; and the Clonsoidated Fund will be liable to snake a fair and reasonable compensation to any person who nrray within the period allowed by law establish a claim in ! respect of the estate the title to which has thus been I registered with a warranted ownership. A similar provision I viU also be extended to those cases where land is sold under I the decree of a Court, subject to the pavment of similar 1 premiums, and to the title being examined and approved of m a similar ma tner "LVIII. Ia bath the above cases, for the convenience of parties, as evidence of their title to the property rezistered, and for other purposes, a certificate of the fact that it has ibeen registered will be delivered by the registrar to the party applying; and this certifcate, duly authenticated by the seal of the ofce, wll be a certificate either of warranted or unwarranted ownership, as the case may be. It will be advisable that this certificate should state on the face of it the name of the registered owner, the lands registered, and 1 the encumbrances (if any) to which they are subject. It wvill also contain a reference to the indexes which relate to the entry thereof in the books of the registry. " LIX. The general effect of the kind of registration here recommended-will be, that for the purposes of transfer, the registsred ownership wiU st atl tinies represent the fee simple of the property, and, as such, it will not be capable of any subdivision or modification into partial or limited estates or interests, except so far as charges and leases may also be admitted to the benefit of registration under the provisions which we shaU presently mention, " LX. The right to dispose of and transfer the ownershp of land in fee, including the right to charge and les t arme, 'inU belong and be incident to and In fact be taken as forming part of the registered ownership. " LXL When the registered ownership has not been warranted, it wil be subject to such rights and interests as existed in or were capable of attaching upon the pro! perty at the time of the first registration, but it wXll not be subject to any rights or interests arising or created at any period subsequent to the time when the first registry was effected, except charges and leases admitted to the register, and except interests protected by caveat or inhibition, asafterwards mentioned. Thenceforward the title to the property, for the purposes of transfer, will be manifested by the register, and by that i alone; and so eventually the only title to land which a pur- chaser need examine will be the last transfer as the same in recorded in the registrars hooks. At thecommencement indeed, the validity of the title of the first registered owner will still depend, as it does now, on the validitv of the party by whom the transfer has been made. but as time passes on this title will gradually strengthen itself, until it has reached a period which, under the operation of the Statute of Limitations, gwill make it complete, and mature it into an unimpeachable statutory title. Year by year the purchaser will be brought nearer and nearer to this result, and so the expenses which attend the retrospective investigationof title will be graduaDydiminished, un,til they reach their minimum point. " LXI. When the registered ownership is a warranted ownership, thespecial advantages to bederived fromthissystem of regisration will immediately follow. In such cases the Iegistered ownership wil be subject only to other registered Iights, and wiU be exempt at once fromn all latent claims and interests which may have been created previousivto the time when the property is registered. The registered owner will therefore, have, forthwith, for the purposes of tiansfer, a simple, complete, and indefeasible title. "LXIIL, The registered ownership. whetlher warranted or etherwise, will at alltimes represent. for the purposes of ransfer, what is usually known as the fee simple. subject to ,uch charges and lenses as may be ad,nitted to the register. Imd, in the case of ownership not warranted, to the title i,ntecedent to the first registration. In other words, the 2egister will be a substitute for the documentary or parchment title. But the registered ownership, whetber warranted or otherwise, wil remain subject, as the fee simple now is, Ist, to sueb other rights as are not usually included in the abstract of title, that is to say, those riohts which are incident to the property in a physical rather tian a legal sense, and those which are presumed to attach on all landed property ; and 2dly, also to siseb rights as may be ascertained by inspection on the land itself, or by inquiry of the occupier. Under the first of these heads we inclade al easements, such as rights of water, rights of way, rights of sporting, and rights to light, and those interests which are denominated in law profits 2 prendre, and tithe rentcharges, land-tax, and other taxes and rates of a general character; under the second we include short leases at rackrent where time lessee is in actual occupation of. the premises. -These are rights which are coiumonly evidenced by known usage or conJ,inped enjqynient, or may be ascertained on .the spot by i D,spectzon or inquiry; anid die title to thern is generally ag iudependent of th? documentary title to the pronerty to t teyr will necesatily form a partial exception' to that whichl will constitute the registered owisesship, whether " LXVI Where the parties to a settlement desire it, they ill have the power of registering the property in the names of two or more persons as registered owners, with a short'note (the words ' No survivorship' will be sufficient), intimating that in the case of death of either the iusa c- crescendi is not to have place. The effect of this will be. that if one of the registered owners die, no alteration of the ownership can be made until his place is filled up. And as the prevailing instances of fraudulent or iniproper alienation or stoci are taose where it has devolved npoi one trustee this simple provision (which will completely prevent the devolution of the registered owngemhip upon a smaUer nuEmber of persons than those first registered) will operate as an almost perfect protection to all parties who have or may have any kind of interest in the registered land under any settlement of which the registered owners are trustees. " LXVIL As a further protectioa, those parties who are entitled to any unregistered interest which, as the law now i tands, would render their concurrence necewssry in a sale c f the fee, will be at liberty to enter in the registry a caveat ar inhibition against the transfer of the registered ownership. The caveat or inhibition may and ought to be of vanous kinds, or various in its operation, so as to E dapt itself to the different circumstances under which it will be required. To prevent abuse it will be lodged at the register office, only under proper sanctions, such a the consent of the registered owner, or the ,rder of the Court of Chancery it the registered owner improperlyr efuse to give his consent; and to secure pro-. Ixeetion suited . to the various -conditions of settlements the caveat or iahibition wil be. allowed. to be so framed as to prohibit the transfer of the registered ownership either for a time, specified or during particular lives, or until the occurrence of a stated event, or without the concurrenoe of certain parties who for that purpose may be named or referred to s protecto or under any other condition conformahle to law which te rartles themselves mav think fit to impose. . . " LXIX. Where the registered owner shall be a person named such for the purpoaps of ny settleaes then, as between such registered ownaer. mnd thew beneficiaries interested under the settleme-nt, he will not be at libhrej'rto' retain ,the, registered fownezrfhip,, or to r@isSu on the irgier Fa rewepsi .pw for . 0 Repore of the Commiesioners appointed to consider the ubjedt af the Bpeistration of Titc v;ith rXferen,e to the Sate and Tnamfr of Land.

I" LXX. In order to keep up th chain of title, and to prevent the difficulty which might arise upon the death of any registered owner in obtaiuing a transfer, woetbiuk it' will be cenvenient that for t}e porposes of this measure, as well as for the purposes suggested by the Chancery Comrnissioners, a real representative should be appointed, upon whom the registered ownership shall devolve. This representative will be ordinarily the executor; but where an executor has not been named, or where he has died of renounced probate, power wiU be given to the parties interested to apply to the registrar or to a jadge to supply the place of the deceased registered owner, and to enter the name of some proper person in his stead. " tLXII. Registered tramsferees without valuablecoart sideration will be subject to thecbims of the persons interevted in the unregistered ownership in the same manner as their transferor would have been; but this can be so pro. vided for as not to affect registeredpurchaseis fromnvolaunteers, without fraud; and a further provision can be added that it shaU not be necessary to inquire whether the registered owner acouired his title am a purhaser or not. " I=L We propose that fraud in obtainiDg a transfer of the registered ownership shall defeat the title of the person who becomes registered owner by fraud, but that notice of unregistered rights shall not merely as notice have any sueh effect. We think that, though the purchaser in the course of his inquiries, or before he concludes the purchase, has notice of any claims upon the estate, it wll not be unjust to deprive the parties interested in suchclaims of their tights infavour of such purchser, if their rights are not protected upon the register." As to the mode of describing anld identifying lands on register the comumissioners saya " We re- ,omuiend, - "1. That the registrar shall have power to require the description of the registered lands to be stated and tet forth in such form and manner as he may deem to be best fitted for the purposes of registration. " 2. That at the time of registration it shall he lawfil for the registrar to require the parties applying to be registered as owners of anylandsto producea private map or plan of the lands proposed or intended to be registered; and that such map or plan shaU be made on such scale and contain such particulars for identifying the same with the property registered as the registrar by any generxal or special regulation may in that behalf require. " 3. That before. the registration of the ownerhip of any land, the private map or plan so produced by the applicant sh1U in every case be referred to in the description of the lands required to be entered on the registeritself. " 4. That the registrar shall also be empowered to require at the time of registration that the property proposed or intended to be registered shall contain a reference in the descri.ption given of it to some public map to be kept in the "5. That for that purpose he shall be at liberty to declare that the maps made under the direction of the MasterGeneral of the Ordnance, the tithe commutation maps, or any other maps of the accuracy of which be is satisfied, shall be deemed public maps for the purposes of registration; and if he thinksfit he shall cause copies or reprints of any parts thereof to be made, either on the existing or on an enlarged scale; and suobmaps as are directed to be used orthepurposesof registration shall be deposited in the registrar's office, and copies thereof published and sold in such manner and subject tosuch provisions as the registrar may direct. b 6. And that, as the main object of the public maps wiUl be to facilitate searches and references, the register shaU be empowerDed to adapt the maps to the districts created forthe purposes of registratson, or to form the districts with reference to the number, quality, and description of theavailable public maps, so that each district may have its own public map or maps to which the parties seeking for information w;ill be able to refer," fo The commissioners recommend a seprte registration of encumbrances. They say:- " LXXV. With regd to encumbrances we think that the benefits to be derived from registration should be extended to the owners of charges upon the fee of land as fully as to the owners of the fee itself. The registration of charges may properly be subjected to the following roles - "1. Every charge intended to be registered shaU so be entered on the register as to show the name of the owner thereof, the lands upon 'which the same is made, the amount of money secured thereby, the rate of interest payable thereon, and the date of the instrument by which it is created. "2. very such charge shall also be entered under some proper sanction, such as the consent of the registered owner to the registration thereof, or the order of a competent Court decreeing or directing the same to be registered. " 3. On the registratioa of such charge the registered ownership will be subject to the legal rights and powers incident to the charge, and either may be transferred independently of the other. "s4. A certificateof the chargewill begiven bytheregistrar to the party applying to register the same. " 5. The priorities of a1l charges shall be determined exclusively according to the dates of their respective registration. " 6. Unregistered charges shall only take effect as unregistered interests, but may be protected in like manner as unregistered interests." The Commissioners thus provide for the registration of leases - LXXVIL The benefit of registration will also be conferred on the owners of leases for the term of 21 years and npwards. The registration of leaseswvdll be subject to the following raises: "I Every lease intended to be registered shall so be entered as to show the name of the owner thereof, the leencgrthaof the term, the date of the lease, and the rent "2, Every such lease shall also be entered under some proper sanction, such as the consent of the registered owner or tne order of a competent conrt decreeing or directing the same to be registered. " 3. On registering such lease the registered ownership will be subject to the legal rights incident to the lease, and either may be transferred independently of the other. " 4. A certificate of the lease dll be given by the regis trar to the party applying for the registration of the same. "LXXVIIL The mode of transferring registered charges and registered leaseholdsowll e similar in all respects, lttis mutast ds, to the mode of transferring the registered ownership; and on the deabh of the registered osy ners thereof, their represeatatives will be entitled to beregistered in their place. "rLXXIX There are some cases in which provisions, in connexion with the proposed register, mavy be made to fad. litate the sale and transfer of land, though not provisions which can be said to be indispensable to the systemn as a | system of registration. It has been, suggested to us that means might be devised by which the conversion of land into money could be effected at once, with the concurrence only of the person having possession and enjoyment of the land, if care were taken to provide a safe independent plaoe of deposit for the money for division among the parcies having pecuniary claims oa it. Facilities, it is said, might be given in some cases to allow the transfer of the land to proceed, impoundingjUhe consideration for the transfer, and fixing it with tI3n4ities under notice. This, it is urged, svould be specially desirable in cases of pecuniary cdatms or charges on the land the title to wvhich charges muay be embarrassed. " We have adopted these views, and propose to vest in the Court of Chancery certain powers for the purpose suggested. " LXXX. A provision which it is most important to attend to is the mode of indexing the pro registered. This must be left to a great extent to the determination of the registrar. But, since there are three matters more or less distinct from each other, yet more or less connected together, which would have to be entered in different ways -namely, registered ownerships, registered charges, and registered leases-there must cealsothree sets of indexes corresponding therewith ;-namely, first, au index of regitered owners; secondly, an index of encumbrancers; and, thirdly, an index of lessees; and these indexes should so far refer to each other that the registered ownership should always show by a distinct reference whether such ownership was subject or not to any existing charge or lease, " LX.KXL With regard to seame misoellaneous questions as to the machinery of the proposed registry, we think that the title deeds should not be required to be delivered up to the registrar; thatthe registrar shcold have a generAl power of determining conflicting claims b,y consent, or of putting them in a course of judicial determination ; that no tenancy in common should be allowed In a registered ownership; that a general power should be given to the registrar of making necessary regelations, and that there should be a difference of fees for large Aud small transactions," We have now set forth a complete summary of the Report itself. The consideration of the reasons on which the Commaissioners have come to their final decision must be reserved for another paper.

BA.RODA.-ADC CNRAT.TYA The half-yearly meeting of this company was held eterday at the offices, Liverpool-street, Colonel French, p.,. int the cihair. -Mr. Kennedy, the secretry, read thb motice can the ineeting, and: affixed the sealto the register of p"opnetori. -The report, an abstract of which has appeaed in 27h,_ 2iVeS, was taken as read. A PaOmirOiRo siad, he perceived from the reprt thatgreas complaint had ben madeinrespect to the deayixterposed by the East India Company and the Home GovernInentin respect to the portion of their line between Forabay and Sunrat; and that the delay was calculated to seriouslyiDjue the property of the shareholders. It appeazed to,hum that the gist of the matter lay-m a mall cor and that the extent of the injury could be measuredbrthe> amount of interest wbich would acrns dnrlngtls delay, and hch they would have to repay the East India Comtpant.

The works wereat present going on between Surat and Ah medabad, and,; when these were approaching completion the delay in thew constrction of the line from Bombav to SraSt woulw tell heavily against the company. He aid not at- prueatW see how they could estimate the injury which .would naise.- from delayiingthe construction of that most important seG- - A DrEcToR stated that the board had not dieregraded the question of interest; forthey had represented theiatterto the authorities of the India-house% to the effect thb4 althoughtheyallowedthe company 5percent. on the amountpaid into the treasury, yet the company ought to have somecreditgiventhemfortbe ussof the large balaneo in hand, with a view to lessen the company's debt in respect of thew interest Allowed on the whole of the capital dtring eonstruction. They told them iu reply that the East IndiaCompany were entitled to any advantage th%t might resnlt from thebalanoein hand, becausethey ran the risk of thoe raiwaypayingthemubackthe5 per cent. Thequestionhad been mooted, and the other companies were in a similarposition. Colonel KEN-EDY remarked that tho balances-for lL1mouths in the hands of the East India Company averaged 2,787,0001. for all the railways; this amount incladed.' 175,9921. as the average balance for the 11 montbs of the,. Bombay,Baroda,and Central India Company; which at S percent. for the year would amonnt to 8,7 99., and would form - a debt to that amount against them. That, however, was. the least Dart of the injury. The chief loss would arise front the-delay in commencing the junction with Bombay, because the northern end of the line would. in all, probability, be unprofitable until the sonthern end was completed froma Surat to Bombay. They could' only keep down the -debt 'against them for interest-. by calling up as little money as possible. They could not complain of calls in some respects, although. the authorities had required a payment of 61. per share on. the naew capital. They did not at present want so much as they had in hand to pay current expenses. The COIAIELMAX, in moving the adoption of the report, explained that the directors had done everything ther could to give effuct to the memorial agreed to by the proprietors at the last meeting, for obtainingpernaision to construct the importamt section of their line from Srsat to Bombay. On the 1st of Mlay, 1856, the oompany obtained the firt portion of land for the railway, the monsoon commenced soon after and but little oould be done until the cold season. He hoped the last portion of thea section from Surat to Ahmedabad would be soon in coursef of constraction. With regard to the importance of con- stracting the railway between Surat and Bombay, it ap-. - peared from an official document that in the course of five years, from 1851 to 1856, the cost of conyeyance of cottonL alone from Surat to Bombay amounted to 33,500,000 rupees, or about 335,0001., being equal to the estimated cost of 56miles of the railway. All the local authorities were unani- mous as to the propriety of immediately constructing the line.- between Surat and Bimbay. Thedirectors woulddo all they could to bnug the matter under the consideration of the- Home Government, with a view to obtain their sanotion. ' (Hear, hear.) The report was then unanimously adopted. Mr. WIM said it would be recollected that at the last meeting of the proprietors they had agreed to forward a- memorial to the local authorities of India in resgeet to obtaining all the information that was requisite to enablethe, homeauthorities co come to a decision on the subject. They had responded to that memorial in so satisfactory a mannerthat it would be the duty of the shareholders tofoloow that up by a memorial to the Board of Control and the East IndiaCompanyto considerthequestion. HethenreadthememoriaL It called attention to the approval of the Governor in Council and the local authorities in Bombay in favour of' the line from the latter place to Surat. The -harbour of' Surat having a bar across it, and being inaccessible forseveral months in the year for vessels of sufficient size, could not admit of the trade to the upper portion of the railway being carried on by coasting vessels. The line' from Bombay wouldbelS.0milesinlength, and pat s through a very productive'and populous district, the railway bridges across the rivers could at a small additional expense be made available to the inh4bitants as a roadw*y for carriages, &c., where no sirch roads or bridges now exiat. The oonstraction of the 180 miles from Bombay to Surat would bring into profitable operation the 143 miles from SurattoAhmedabad, which wouldbe otherwise of butlittle. value; but, by making the section proposed, 323 miles oftrunk railway extending into the cotton district would be made available at the small average cost of 7,0001. per mile, provided the werks were commenced immediately. After a short discussion a resolution was unanimously passed approving the memorial, authorizing the chairmanto sign it on behalf of the company and present it to the Board of Control and the Hon. East India Company. The rehring directors, Mr. D. J. Bay and Mr. J T. acken&ie, were re-elected, as wras also Mr. Goodchap, therretiring auditor. It was 'sged to print and circulate copies of the memorial among thae shareholders, .The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to thechairman and directors. PUNJAB. It is stated that although this railway company, the Scinde Railway Company, and the Indus Flotilla Company are to be conducted under one management for the ourposeof economy, there is no intention of amalgamating the capitals of the three companies. Each capital will therefore be kept distinct. The recent discovery of coals near the upper terminus of the Scinde lRailway is expected to enuhence the value of the undertaking. GREAT WESTERN. This company's branch line from Twyford to Henley wasopened yesterday for public traffic. NEWPORT, ABERGAVEN,NY, AND HIEREFORD. The opening of the Crumlin viaduct on this company'sline took place yesterday, in the presence of many of the principal engineers in the county and a vast number of' spectators. Special trains ran from Hereford, Bristol, and other towns, and a considerable number of visitors from. London attended. The height of the viaduct is 200 feet, and beneath runs the WVestern Valley line of the Monmouthshire Railway Company. The viaduct is almost wholly constructed of iron. The centre piers are cnomposed of 140 cast-iron columns, cach 17 feet long and 12 inches in diameter, placed in tiers of 14. columns eacb. The heads of the columns are retained in their positions by cast-iron girders. The piers at base are 60 feet by 30, tapering to 24 feet by 16, the whole being laterally and vertically strengthened by a system of cross bracings. The top of each pier is surmounted by a frame of' cast-iron, upon which the ends of the main girders rest. The entire superstractmne consists of 10 sDans of 150 feeteach, which, with the approaches, make itS length one-third. of a mile. Over each span there are four main tirders, covered by a platform of 6-inch plalking, upon which thepermanent way is laid. The frst column was fixed in December, 1853. The entire work has been carried out to the satisfaction of every one concerned by Mr. T. W. Kennard. The engineers were Messrs. Liddell and Gordon, A. dinner to celebrate the event was given by the contractor. KILLARNEY JUNCTION. The half-yearly meeting of this company-was held in. Dablin on Satarday.
