MONBY-MARKETandOITYI.NTBLLIGENCE. Monday Evening. Owing to the largeness of the specie arrlvals during the past few days, the funds opened thls morning at an advance of a quarter per cent. upon the improved price of Saturday, but subsequently experienced a reaction. The first transactions in Console for money were at 90a to -1, whence, upn some realizations, a decline took place to 90i, at which they olosed. For the new acoount on the 14th of October the last quotation was 90k to 91. Money was in good supply on Government securities at 4i per cent.,-i but in the discount-manket the demand was active, and the Bank rates are in most Instances freely paid. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 217; Reduced, 90i to 9L; New Three per Cents., 9l1. tot; India Stock, 210 to 212; India Bonds, 20s. to 16s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. The transactions in foreign stocks have been rather more numerous, and the market wears a firmer appearance. Turkish closed at a further small advance. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 101I; Buenos Ayres, 85, 84, and 83k; Granada New Active, 22i; Peruvian Three per Cents. for the account; 551; Sardinian, 89Q; Spanish Deferred, for the account, 251; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 95 and 95i; and Datchl Four per Cents. Certificates, 99i and i. The corn-market this morning was scarcely so depressed as on Friday, but the tranmactions effected were at a decline of between 3a. and 4s. from the rates of this day week. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. this evening on the Paris Bourse were 66f. 95c. for money and 66f. 90c. for the present account, showing a further fractional decline. About 140,0001. in gold was sold to the Bank to-day. Of this 104,0004. was American, and 36,0001. Rusian. The specie brought by La Plata from the West Indies and Mexico is 445,0001., of which 340,0001. is silver. The commercial advices from New York by the Persia describe a renewed panic in the stock-market, which has caused an average fall of about 5 per cent. in all descriptions of speculative securities. Erie Railway had receded to 30 ; Reading, 69h; New York Central, 78; Panama, 92; and Iluolin Central, 114 to J. Michigan Southern had touched 30, being equal to a decline of 25i per cent, within a few days, upon a discovery that the company have been raising loans on certain amounts of reserve stock, and that its general finances are in a state of utter disorganization. It would be well for the commercial credit of the country if the report of the meeting of the Great Northern Railway Company held on Saturday could be expunged. For the first time, it is believed, in our city annals we have seen the chairman of one of the largest undertakings in Great Britain wind up a series of discreditable sophistries by venting at a section of his constituents an insolent oath from the chair in which it was his paramount duty to set an example of moderation and order. But it is not the personal conduct of Mr. Edmund Denison, M.P., that constitutes the disgrace. Mr. Denison's fame could receive no addition, whether he adopted the course of commiserating the helpless persons, "' widows and others," who are kept out of their dividends, or of boasting that his services to the railway and the public have been immeasurable, or of calling his constituents "blockheads," and of swearing that he is not going to be such a fool as to answer their questions. When Mr. Denison, in his pity for those who are kept out of their dividends, insinuates that the evil has arisen not from his giving to a notorious scoundrel the full command of the registration department of the company, but from the resistance of the preference shaeholders to an attempt at repudiation, he merely repeats his previous reasonings. As to his aervices to the railway, all that the shareholders know is that the intrinsic goodness of the line cannot be owing to Mr. Denison, that he has developed no new principle of any kind, that the company have been engaged in bitter contests with other undertakings, and are now entering upon a most serious one, that there has been no sufficient supervision up to the latest moment to prevent revenue charges from being carried to capital, and that the private control has been such as to admit of the uninterrupted progress through a period of nine years of almost the largest fraud ever perpetrated. Mr. D enison may therefore be left to exhibit himself in any aspect he pleases. The point now to be regretted is that there is hardly a single offence of mismanagement which may not hereafter be defended in any public company by citing the Judgment and example of the shareholders of an undertaking representing 8,000,0001. sterling of capital. At the meeting on Saturday the chairman and directors were rebuked by the majority present, and such was the impression created that even among the minority who sought to aid them by their votes, not a single individual could be found willing publicly to accept tbe responsibility of standing up in their defence. But an ample supply of proxies was in the pocket of the chairman, and by these the body of shareholders have become committed to a full approval of all that has passed. Let us recognize the results. Supposing it should transpire at any future time that the Government, the Bank of England, or any of our largest establishments having the regulation of millions of public money, had appointed a man who had already left one situation for robbing his employers, and who had also contrived in six months trading to swindle his creditors, paying them only Is. Od. in the pound, to one of the most responsible officts in their gift, how can any censure or punishment be inflicted when the shareholders of our public companies, representing the average honour, wealth, and intelligence of the country, not merely pass over such acts, but virtually, in the most emphatic manner express their sanction of them ? Again, if it is found that an office has been so conducted that during nine years the most sweeping frauds have been carried on, which the slightest watchfulness might have averted, and in the midst of circumstances of every kind calculated to beget distrust, where shal any condemnation fall ? Or if a secretary is proved to have signed dividend warrants in bundles without asking even their total amount, or to have habitually lefc the stamp representing his signature to be used at pleasure by aDy one around him, how can such au offlicer hereafter be reproved or dismissed without being entitled to gomplain that evenhanded justice does not prevail, and that he is made a victim where others have been rewarded? And if, moreover, in head-quarters this is to be the system, |if chairmen, directors, and secretaries are to receive under such conditions the tribute of unlimited confidence, what will be the feeling in aU the lower grades of service? Wbat will clerks, mechanics, and porters think of the justice of a company that confers an increase of honour upon those who thus violate superior duties, while it dismisses to starvation a poor offender with a dozen children who, jaded with over-work, may neglect the simplest point of daily routine? It is not too much to say that a more lamentable proe cedent was never set in a commercial community than that now furnished. It strikes at the root of our national reputation for dealing impartially with the high and the low, and is the more painful from the suspicion that out of all those who have been parties to it probably nine-tenths would have hesitated if, instead of adopting the convenient and comparatively secret process of sending up a proxy, they had been required openly to pronounce for it with their own lips. Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in the stoc'c and ahare-markets during August. The range of Consols has been 11 per cent., and the ;*sult of the operations of tho month has been to establish a fall of bj per oent., in addition to tLat of 1i wimWh occurred in July. At the same time the buller in thie Bazk has experien&ed. &Qduction of abot hat a-million, while the accounts of the Bank of France have also exhibited a falling off of 895,ooo0 . In railway shares, likerise, the general tendency has been towards reaction, although the movements have been varied,-some lines, such as the Caledonian and North-Eastern, showing great firmness, Vhile others have suffered rather severely, especially the &reat Western, the South-Eastern, SouthWestern, Brighton, and Great Northern. On the continental Bourses durng the month there has been nniversal inactivity land dulneas. At Paris the quotation of the French Three per Cents. was exactly the same at the beginning as at the close:- UOTUtAIONS IN THE STOCK AIM SHEARX MiRnM DVUpNG THx MoNT or AuGusr. 1857. mUe reports ot the trade of the manufacturing towns for the past week describe a rather active business at =anchester, although it has been moderate as compared with the excitement in the. Liverpool cotton-market. At Birmingham the demand for iron is well sustained, and large contracts are in hand. A further advance has occurred in copper. For the general manufactures of the place large orders have arrived from Australia, and employment is also increased by the requirements of the East India Company for arms and accoutrements. At Nottingham there has been an improved inquiry for lace, but the hosiery branches are still very dul1. Ia the woollen districts business is limited, but steady, and the Irish linen-markets are without alteration. At Glocester the failure has been announced of Mr. W.. Cassie, a railway contractor, for 80,0001. At a meeting of the British Telegraph Company this afternoon, the Hon. F. Cadogan in the chair, the report was unanimously adopted, and a dividend declared for the past half-year at the rate of 4 per cant. per annum free of income-tax. The result of the amalgamation of this undertaking with the Magnetic Telegraph has been highly satisfactory, an increased profit having been made simultaneously with a reduction of working expenses. The net receipt for the half-year is 15,3121., and after providing for the divdend of the Magnetic Telegraph Company and other charges a balance is carried forward of 1,0331. 2001. was votedfor the remuneration of the directors. At a meeting of the East India Coal Company today, Sir T. H. Maddock in the chair, a certificate was read from the mint master at Calcutta as to the quality of the coal tendered for a contract with the East India Company, which has been since accepted. The supply of coals will be largely increased when the new machinery is in full operation. The general business of the port of London during the past week has been moderately active, although the arrivals have been much less numerous. The total of ships reported inward was 210, being 170 less than in the previous week. These included 49 with cargoes of grain, flour, &c., the arrivalsofsugar beiDg also very large. The number of ships cleared outward was 145, including 19 in ballast, showing a decrease of 4. One vessel only cleAred direct for Shanghai. The followiDg is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders- " The committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated the 2d inst. The Eatandare (the official ournal of the capital) of the 13th of July last publishes the circular order of th3 Minister of Finanee, dated June 25, on the receipt of which by the Custom-houses the suspension of payments was to ceaee as regards the foreign bondholders and convention creditors, with a provlso, however, that the Government anticipations (to the amount, it was said, of about $205,000) still in hircmlation were to be satisfied out of the duties. According to this, the revenues of the dividend fand would again be at the disposal of the bondholders about the beginning of July last, burdened with a Labiity of about $51000, Ia Plata, however, brings no remittance yet, for which various reasons are given. Te k22,000 in the hands of the agents in Colima had arrived safely In Manzanillo for shipment to the Bank of England, vid Panama. The Republic was tranquil, and the difficulties with Spain appeared for the moment to be tho chief sub. ject of excitement there." Colonel Facio, the Mexican financial agent, also states:- "By the Royal West India steamer La Plata, just arrived, $22,000 have been received from Colima, vid Panama, for the MexiGan dividends. Besides the above sum 66.6761. 7s. lld. is already deposited in the Bank of England.1" __

RAILWAY AND MINING SARBES. Monday Eveng. The railway-market has been firm, and in some descriptions an advance has taken place. Lancater and Carlisle improved 51. Great Western were in goad demand for transfer, the speculative sales having exceeded the supply of the stock in the market. South-Eastern were 10s. lower. In the last issue of Great Northern Preference there was an advance of 11. Indian shares showed no alteration; Grand Trank of Canada were rather better. A *mall improvement occurred in Northern of France, Paris and Lyons, and Southern of France. In mines, East Bassett, Sortridge, Wheal Buller, and Wheal Edward advanced, and a reduction took place in Wheal Bassett. In miscellaneous seOurities South Australian Land closed II. higher.

ZONDON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1. 1857. The exertions incumbent upon every department of Government and every authority in the king.- dom to rescue with all possible despatch our countrymen in India from the traitorous miscreants athirst for their blood, and to re-establish our rule in the East by such a blow as even that country, in all its vicissitudes of conquest, has never yet felt, are so universally understood and accepted that no argument on that point is now required. Hra MAJESTY'S speech, in its expressions of svmpathy for the sufferers, of admiration for the heroism contending against such odds., and of resolution to re-assert the [supremacy of order, will find an echo in every breast throughout the land. If we revert to the subjwt it is less to insist with what we feel would be a super(uous urgency on the necessity of ceaseless efforts, than to place before the public a brief account of what has been actually done. The old maxim of war, that nothing should be considered accomplished while aught remains to be achieved, applies indeed with signal force to the occasion before us; but the exertions made by LQrd CA;ING in Calcutta, by the Government at home, and by the subordinate auithorities in all places, are really strikingenough both to carry some reassurance to an anxious nation and to invite the acknowledgments which good service merits. The Army Estimates for the present year provided for the maintenance in India of 24 regiments of infantry and four regiments of cavalry, comprising in the aggregate about 30,000 Europeans of all ranks. The actual numbers in India at the period of the outbrealk were, we believe, somethiug short of this amount ; but, in addition to the QuEns's troops, t4e Company itself maintained nine strong battal4ons of Europeans-three for each Presidency n its own military establishmIents. Altogether therefore, there might perhaps have been a ut 40,000 British soldiers in India. at the com4iencement of the mutinies, and Iof this force a very large proportion, probably not less than one-half, was stationed in the Presidency of Bengal. The lion's share, however, in the distribution fell to the single province of the Punjab. Owing partly to the vigilance exercised over our North-Western neighbours, and partly to the prescriptive demands of this recently acquired territory, the Punjab usually absorbed something like two-thirds of the whole European force of Bengal, leaving only a scanty remnant for the protection of the enormous districts between Unmballah and Calcutta. The result, it is true, has been advantageous enough as far as concerns the Punjab itself. This, in reality, has been the only province of India occupied and administered upon the system which our best soldiers and statesmen have thought desirable, and we now reap the benefit of the policy in such a state of its affairs as enables its rulers not only to preserve the authority of the Government, but to despatch succours to the army before Delhi. The circumstance, however, requires to be remembered in estimating the difficulties with which the Government of India had to contend at the explosion of this diabolical conspiracy. It is probable that the .vhole European force stationed in the North-Western Prorinces and Bengal Proper in the spring of the present year did not exceed some 5,000 or 6,000 men. Let us now look, in the first place, to what has been done 'oy Lord CANNING and the authorities of the other Presidencies. Since the terrible character of the mutiny was decideh Lord CANNING has collected at Calcutta, and despatched to the points where aid was most required, the 29tn, S5th, and 84th Regiments, aud the Fusileer6, from Madras and Burmab ; the 64th, the 78th, i and the Bombay Fusileiri,' from Bombay; the 5th, from the Mauritius ; and a wing of $h. 37th, with some Royal Artillery, from Ceylon. He has succeeded in intercepting from China, or will have done so as soon as the shipwreck !. of theTransit can be remedied, the 23d, the 82d, the 90th, and the 93d. A steam flotilla has also been despatched to the Cape for such reinforcements as can be spared; and it will be hard indeed if three strong and seasoned battalions at the least are not transferred from the eastern frontier of that colony to the plains of Hindostan. All these efforts, it will be o'oserved, and all these perform'nces are entirely independent of what, for the relief of our countrymen and the honour of our arms, we have been doing at home. The amount of this work we now proceed to show. It was on Saturday, the 2 7'th of June, that the curt and scarcely credible communications of 'the telegraph first announced to the country that the rnutiny of the Bengal Army had assumed the characteristics now but too well known. On Wednesday, the 1st of July, the stream of reinforcements from these shores to Calcustta set steadily out, and from that hour to the present it has flowed on so continuously and -with so sustained and even accelerated a current that we scarcely know where to look for any similar example. On a single day in July-the 21st-six vessels left these coasts, conveying 1,700 troops; and the whole number of ships despatched during that month was 29-all but two for every successive day. The month which terminated yesterday witnessed redoubled efforts, as the energies of the country rose promptly to the level of the exigencies which each mail announced. In the aggregate, we despatehed to the East in July about 9,000 troops; in August we sent upwards of 15,000, and in ships of greater size and swiftness than before. In the 29 vessels departing during July there was only a single steamer; in the 28 which followed in August there were no fewer than 17. Those readersand there will doubtless be many-whose interests will carry them through the details of these statistics will find the information very intelligibly tabulated in another columnn of our impression this morning. Some 25,000 soldiers, it will be seen, have left England for India since the 1st of July last, irrespectively of all those reinforcements which have been assembled at Calcutta from other parts of our Eastern dominions, or drawn from our other colonies or expeditions. If it is remembered that these efforts have been made -with a peace establishment, and immediately after a considerable reduction of our military resources, the result, we think-, wiU assume an aspect by no means unsatisfactory, and will show how very effective a counterpoise will shortly be provided for those mutinous battalions whose successive treasons we yesterday catalogued. When the first keel of this fleet enters the waters of the Hooghly our anxieties for the safety of our countrymen wiU be approaching their close, for the torrent of steel will tlien be setting in with an unbroken and irresistible I flood. If, indeed, between 60 and 70 days may possibly suffice, under favourable conditions, to carry a good ship from Portsmouth to Calcutta, the desired hour must even now be at hand; for since the Bucephalus and Barham led the van of the squadron two clear months have elapsed this very morning. Nor need too much thought be given to the distance which vill still intervene between the new comers and their comrades. It is a long way, no doubt, from Calcutta to Delhi, but the news will do almost as much for us as the arrival itself. In Asiatic countries intelligence travels from viUage to village with a celerity utterly mysterious. The knowledge of the army on its way to vengeance will reach as if by lightning every Sepoy in Hindostan, and the sanguinary miscreants will feel, to their despair, that behind the first advance, be it. ever so small, marches the force of outraged Britain. But there is no room yet for contentment or repose. Not only may the undiscernible exigercies of the future require even more than the array provided, but these very numbers exact commensurate reinforcements. The demands of an army in this respect are proportioned to its strength, and for every battalion we despatch it is indispensable that we should establish corresponding reserves. We do not, indeed, look for extraordinary casualties. We do not anticipate on our own territory of India any such losses as those in the Criiea. Our troops have hitherto supported the climate, even under trying service, with an impunity that some time ago would have been thought incredible, and the hot season is already passing awvay. Still, comnon sense calls for unremitting exertion, aDd with inexhaustible resources and a unanimous nation the work of Government should be easy. They have not been wanting to their task. Fifteen thousand men of the Militia will be immeediately called out, and fifteen second battalions of the Line wiiU be formed in the stead of the regiments which have embarked for India. Those regiments, moreover, wvhich are either at home or on colonial service will be raised from 840 to 1,000 men each as soon as the progress of recruiting permits. An additional force of Artillery will also be sent to India, so that there may be no doubt of our supremacy in that most essential arm. We have been surprised by assassins and traitors, there is no denying, and we must put up with such reproach as that event implies, but the reproach of leaving anything undone which can accelerate the rescue of our countrymen and the re-establishment of our power would be far more disgraceful and unendurable, and we feel sure the nation will not deserve it.
The Indian Mutiny is eminently a barbaric movemeiit. It is such as what we call civilized States have always been liable to from the ruder nations whom they held in subjection-such, for example, as the Romans had to encounter, and did encounter with success, a hundred times from Gauls, from Britons, from Germans, from various Asiatic nations, and even at an earlier date from some of their own Italians. But in the oldl sense of the word, which is a very true sense, and has much significance, the Asiatics were always especially barbaric, and they are now much what they were thousands of years ago. So the precedents of this rebellion are antique, rude, and fabulous. It is the rebellion of a pampered soldiery, the oldest incident of Asiatic history, and the worst feature of Rome when it declined into a barbaric empire. Its seat is Central Hindostan, and it endeavours, happily in vain, to enlarge itself towards the coasts. It is the rebellion of the land against the sea and those maritime powers and influences which now have the mastery of the world. Whenever it reaches within a certain distance of the sea, or to a certain distance from its centre, it withers at once. Benares, Nepaul, the Punjab, the Deccan, are unfavourable to it, and when the Bengalese mutineers happen to be stationed at a distance, instead of endeavouring to establish themselves wvhere they are, as they probably would if they had a chance, they converge and faU baek on Delhi. This was the old metropolis of India, and answered very well when fleets did not govern the world. That it should be a metropolis now is as absurd as the idea of giving laws to Asia Minor, holding the supremacy of theA3gean and the Mediterranean, and even conquering Greece, from Nineveh, Persepolis, or Susa. When DArivs in his extremity desired the cooperation of his Admirals, he found they were powerless, for their ships were manned by Greeks. Shbe crowing barbarism of this movement is the attempt to revive an effete dynuaty, and an empire that had long been dismembered even before we had to do with it. The power of the MoGum had long been restricted within the region of the present revolt, and the Proclamation now issued from Delhi invites the maritime and North-Western States of Hindostan to prostrate themselves to a tyranny which they had long repudiated, and which many never did obey. They need scarcely be invited to consider whether they would fnd themselves better off under a Government at Delhi than under one whose virtual weat is the ocean, and which is at home in every port and on every shore. If, too, the muitineers of Central India all flock for mutual aid and encouragement to Delhi, the maritime provinces, and those on the great navigable rivers, see what is thought of their danger if they should join the mutiny. The barbaric element is one of inevitable weakness, and is the very reason of our dominion in the East. A handful of u rule over those 200,000,000 subjects because we are open in our dealings, because we abstain from wanton cruelty and malicious vengeance, because we insult no religion, becaue we keep order,-because, in a word, and on the whole, we give these many nations and divers religions greater peace and toleration than they would be likely to obtain from one another. A moveinent -which exhibits the contrary of all these things must therefore be unpopular with aU those who do not happen themselves to expect pay or plunder under it. The great bulk of the rich and also of the poor are evidently and most naturally averse to it. After several generations of British rule, they woulld rather not return to massacros of women anwC children, to the violent abduction and sale of women, to open gaols, and general license of plunder and worse crimes; or even to what is more terrible than all,-a reign of treachery. We have been surprised, it must be confessed; we have been over-confident; but this over-confidence, of which the ambitious Mahomedan and the vain Brahmin have taken such an advantage, and which they found it so easy to flatter, is a more popular quality with the simpler elss than the arts employed against it. The mass of these 200,000,000 know what to expect from us, and they know also what they are to expect from men whose weapons are secrecy and dissimulation. It is the weak old Asiatic, the traitor and the slave, who has been played agaimst us. The men who went in a deputation to the officers in the fort of Allshabad, where they were taking refuge, and besought them with tears to show more confidence by returning, to the cantonments; and within twenty-four hours had massacred all but a fez, whom they were roasting over a slow fire, with other unutterable cruelties, are not the men to win credit with mankind anywhere, so long as that mankind may choose its rulers. They don't belong to a governing, race. There can be nothing noble or generous about them. Even their seeming gentleness is to be suspected. The sleeker, the softer, the smoother, the more dangerous. There are great varieties of races in Hindostan. Some of these are as honest and plainspoken as ourselves. Do they wish to be ruled by men whose embraces may be any moment an ambuscade t Thus far it is evident they do not. The barbaric nature always leans on the stronger element, because it knows itself, and distrusts those whom it knows to share its own weaLnesses. We have suppl-anted the Mahomedans in their dominion over the Hindoos, because the latter reaUy respect us more than they do the Mlahomedans. The type of the revolt is NuFN SAHr-B. He is the true barbaric ideal. It is he and his predecessors in the line of treachery wlo have kept Asia down since the beginning of the world, and made her the property and prey of any stronger race. Yet in a sense this man is Young Asia, and we see what we are to expect from communicating European arts and accomplishments toHindoos without our religion or our manly character. It is said that he is quite an accomplished gentleman; he speaks English fluently and well; he was a constant visitor at Cawnpore; a great friend of the officers; a companion in their field sports; often invited to their picnics. His alleged wrong we have already exposed. He has been entirely made by the British rule, and owes everything, his very existence, to us. Such is the man who, having indaced his old friends and companions, the officers at Cawnpore, to capitulate, as they did chiefly on account of the crowd of poor women and children they had in the fort at the point of starvation, massacred the whole, -no, not the whole immediately. Some of the women he sold openly in the bazaars to his soldiers. About thirty he kept for himself. All that is known of itheir subsequent fate is, that when this plmpered and petted Indian gentleman found himself on the point of being attacked by General HAvELoex he brought out these thirty Englishwomen to the front of his army and struck off their heads. There is the picture of Young India. This is the sort of man, not the wretched old puppet at Delhi, not the imbe- cile King of OUDE, who would step into the place I of Queen Vicroirra, should the MLutiny ever come to anything. In that case, we see in this man the India of the future. For our part, however, we trust to see in him the self-condeimation and early end of this movement. India has learnt something from us; it lknows the blessings of peace, order, and law; and it knows what it would be to fall into the hands of such men as NE.yA SAHTI.
Of the various Peerages which are about to be created, the public will regard v,ith most interest that which elevates MIr. MAC.AXLAY to the House of Lords. It is an honour which belongs peculiarly to the man, and which is a fitting, if not an adequate return, for a life spent in the public serice, and devoted to literary labours of the most dignified order. It is much to say that he is the most popular author of the day, but we have to say more. With a style that compels attention, with a calm wisdom that commands assent, he has interpreted English history to ourselves and to the world. To us the history which he has indicted is worth a score of charters and a cartload of laws; it is our Bill of Rights and our code of political duties. We know better wvhat we are, we know what our fathers fought for, we can sympathize with the aspirations of Whigs, we learn to respect the endeavours of Tories, we are less of partisans and more of patriots. To Europe that history is worth all the constitutions that have yet been devised. It has been translated into many languages and widely read over the continent. Who does not remember the appearance of these volumes in that year of revolution when all the peoples of Europe were maddening with fury about thrones that seemed to be tottering to their fall? It was with profound gratitude that, amid the universal wreck, Englishmen saw, as the h -orian described, how in their country liberty eame to be linked with order, and contentment and fraternity were made consistent with the inequalities of an aristocracy. If it was a lesson which we shall never forget, it was a lesson also which, we have little doubt, will one day bear fiuit in every kingdom of Eurore, making Sovereigns more wise, and mak-inc, sjevts tremble for that crisis shadowed forth by the hiitorian, in which " it msy be necessary to sacrifice even " liberty in order to save civilization." In this view, if we except Lord* PiLjsnsros, therjiX probably not an Etgliahinsn living who has *nor8 powerfully influenced the destinies of Earope tha. Mr. McAuLArY; ansd as for his influence upon ourselves, those who are fond of quoting the haokneyed nsying of FLGErazR of Saltouam would, have a stronger and more inteliJgible case if they would give the preference over the maker of laws,. not to the writer of baHlads, but to the philosophiC historian who leaves his mark as palpably as the great author whom HaR MA;EsTy is nowabout to honour. There can be no more welcome addition to the debates of the Upper House than the orationx which -we trust MIr. AciuL&Y wi occasionally contribute on the few great occasions by which the lSords every session vindicate th* position. Although at one time he took a prominent part in the discussions of the House of Commons, his tone of-thought and style of speaking were never quite suited to the bustling representatives of the people. It is in the Lower House that Cabinets rise and fall, that public moneys are disposed of, that the chief business of the country is transacted. The members are thus too strictly occupied with pasing affairx, too intent upon the result of a division aud the fall of a party, to care much for philosophy or history, even if the philosophy be adorned with all the eloquence of BuRiF, and the history be presented with all the brilliance of MBcAiLAy. But, while the Commons are all for the present, on the other hand, prescription is the vital air of the Peerage, and in the House of Lords our philosophic historian will find an appropriate audience for that stately eloquence which carries with it so much learning and so much wisdom. Especially at the present moment must we rejoice at his elevation, in the hope that when we have crushed this Indian mutiny, and the time comes to consider calmlythe future of our Eastern Empire, the views of one who has described in most glowing terms how England became possessed of that glorious prize, and who, in the preparation of a Code of Indian Law, has shown that he has most profoundly studied the wants of the Hindoo, wiMi be expressed as he alone of living speakcers can express them. Not only on our indian difficulty, but on all questions of high policy, there is not a man in the country whose opinions are entitled to more weight, and who will be more gladly heard. An historian is a statesman on his travels 5 and, while MÂ£r. 31&u.&uLAY will stil travel from century to century and from country to country, we may expect now to havze him sometimes at home with us, givinlg his advioce in the present need.

A Cabinet Council was held yesterday at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing-street. The Mniszters present were Vmscount Palmerston, Earl GranviDe, Sir George Grey, Lord Panmure, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tao Right Hon. Vernon Smith, and the Right Hon. M. T. Baines. The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of two Bank of England notes (83,40 3 and 61,832), value respectively 501. and 201., also of 71. lOs. in gold, in all ,71. lOs., for " unreckoned Income-tax," from "Double I," through "A. D." Rxn'r.SrATroKY OF GRwx-Wi Cl.-A va=cy in the representation of this borough is expected to take place almost immediitely, a petition in bankruptcy having been filed against Mr. Townsend. The only candidate at present is Mr. Alderman Salomons. who is very popular among the constituency, and who was eleoted by a Lage majority in Tan PRr5 FRYnDERICE: WVILLIAM STEAM PAc 'r.-TIn reference to an acount which appeared in 2he Time, of this vessel, and which stated that among other improvements 't had been furnished with "Sir William Snow Harris's compasses," we hbave received a letter from Messm. LiUey and Sons, the opticians, which dernies most positively that that vessel is now or haS ever been supplied with the compesses described. THe TRANSIT.-A letter received froom the agent of the Borneo Company at Singapore, dated July ISrh, ies news from Sarawak up to the 14th of that month. tas then oertain that the rich'field of coal diszove-ad some time eince at Sadong, would be made available for the usne of Her aslesty's troops and steamers in taat qu arter of the wrorld by Chritmas next. The quality of the coal is reported as very pood and its quantity almoit inexhaustible. The agenLt of the Borneo Comoany a.dds to this important aevs the information that he had that dsy chartered to the Government the Sir James Brooke steamer. Which Was to start on the neat dav (the I9;h of July) to prooeed to the wreck of the notorious Transit, in Banca Straits, to he employed as might be required. The Sir James Brooke is a fiue screwr steamer of 0tons, and 90-horse power, belongmo to the Borneo Company of London. After rendering "the las sad offEces" to the Transit, which now, for the first time sinee she was launched, is incapable of doing ndschiei, tbe Sir James Brooke will bo employed in taking 3 0 troops to CWlcut,a, as she is a f&sk clipper steamer, and weLl suited fox suta duties.
CHINTA -- (FrOM OUR SPECIA CORRESPONDENT.) HlONGKrONG,. TTrT . R :LOrd Elgin has arrived. 1 N V ULY 0. it was quite time that something should happen to break the dreary monotony of existence here. 'The last mail did not arrive, and we have only just learnt that the steamer was wrecked. The Shannaon, which brought Lord Elgin, brought Us no alews of any description, except that the Simoom was gone on to Calcutta with the troops from the IMauritius. The sickly season is doing its work. Of the 300 men who now form the strength of the 59th (a tegiment sent here some eight years ago) there are 150 in hospital. The proportion is still greater among the blue-jackets and marines up the river. :Eappily, howrever, the Hongkong fever has not reappeared in its old terrible malignity. Although lfever, dysentery, diarrho3a, and ague are rife, deaths sre not numerous. There is plenty of hospitalzoom, and the surgeons can hold every case well in -3hand. Precautions also are multiplied with a praiseworthy minuteness. Every sentry has sherry and bitters given himn to fortify his stomach against the might miasma; the ships are alternately moved down 4o the healthy islands at the Bogue; and the expulzioII of oUr old friend, the Mandarin of Chuenpee, fwas because hiz fort was wvanted for eanitary lpurposes. The -few wbo have escaped, and who are daring *enough to go out in the sun, try to escape from themselves by a voyage round the Sand or a trip to Macao. I have accomplished both these achievesnents. The voyageround the island was performed in a private pleasure steamer, and, no twithstanding the presence of a well-filled refrigerator, was the hottest thing I ever did in my life. Stanley, at the tack of the island, is a native village and an English barrack. It stands upon a pretty isthmus, with the ,Chinese Sea breathing its south-west monsoon into its face and a tranquil, landlocked bay, rippling against its heels. They say that bay is not large Nenough or deep enough for the fleet of merchantmen the China trade employs. It is now used as a 45athing-place for the troops, as the shelter of amall dishing craft, and as a resource of very hungry Mpirates, who at night or early dawn have sometime8 -dashed into the bay and attempted to carry off Â£shing boats under the eyes of the garrison. It is a -voyage of 40 miles round this little island. It is scarcly more to Macao, and, although the lfate of the Thistle and the Queen has rendered the ,perils of that passage more notorious, I doubt whether there are more pirates lurking in the archipelago between Victoria and Macao than in the islets at the back of Hongkong. While we gaily ~steamed along in our little toy steamer several times did some vicious looking junaks stand down towards -us, their large mat sails looking like the wings of a bird of prey, and heavy cannon frowning mischief ;rom their deck. But they always stood off again wheu Lhey found that we were a party of eight iEnglishmen with revolvers in our belts and rifles lying close at hand. We grow used to precautions ,in this land. Some days since I went to dinner at a house high up upon the hill, and, expreaing some ..surprise at seeing all the guests solemnly depositing 1their revolvers as they entered, was told that a few -weeks since a headless trunk was found in the ditch 'that passes by the wall of the garden. Seven days ago Mr. Chisholm Anstey, Her Majesty's AttorneyGeneral, was at Macao upon some professional busimness, and, going out to enjoy a swim before breakfast, took his comprador with him to guard his clothes. Coming back to the city, the comprador, who was a native of that neighbourhood, remarked that six fellows, of whose antecedents he had some knowledge, had posted themselves three on each -side of a narrow place which he and his master anust pass. This fact being communicated to Her Majesty's law officer, he drew his revolver and vwalked np to affront the danger. The scoundrels >retired precipitately, but -with many imprecations -upon their countryman, the comprador. But aeh, CJhung, and Chibg, and Wang, and Lin, had you but -known how rusty and unserviceable that pistol was, you would have come on boldly with your 15-foot -spears; tbe bag of dollars would have been your WVhy so faint-hearted ? *(?Qis desiderlo sit pudor aut modus *Td, caricapitis ?" That head was worth 500 dollars to you and Ieh. The passage boats to Macao are little armouries. There are cannon upon deck and revolvers in every belt. But s) it 'wars on board the Queen when the -cannon was turned round and fired into the cabin upon the passengers absorbed A in tiflin. Fur-ther precantions, however, are now taken. In the :Fei Ma the Chinese passengers are put down into the hold 12 feet deep, and the ladder is taken away. A sailor keeps guard over them witb ,a dra v.-n cutlass. One of the Yankee ships has an iron cage on deck, into which the Chineae passengers are invited to walk-, and are theu loked up. The Peninsular and Oriental boat has a better but muore costly precaution ; she carries no ,Chinese pa-sengers. Easy, cosy people at home, -who fear nothing but the gout or an easterly wind, .may laugh, or may even, perhap3, be very indig. naut at these precautions. But two boats out of fve have been already taken, and the pas3tngers p ut to death. Death at the hands of thosc simple sons .of civilization is not an easy transit. The Bustard gunboat unly a few days since, on taking a pirate, found two men nailed to planks, each with a stinkpot tied rouud his neck and slow matches burning. By -what t orments the prisoners taken in the Queen perished we do not know. She vfas carried up to that very Fatahan Creek where the battle of the Ist of June took place. P eces of machi- nery marked by fire were seen on a point near the fort; some revolvers were found in onot of the junks; and Captain Corbett obtained a Portu- guese flag from a Mandarin boat which afterwards iblew up. These circumstances do not absolutely prove, but they strongly suggest, that some scene of fLorr-rs was enacted in this spot, and that the fleet -we destroyed were spectators of the tortures. Every mana in that fleet has been a pirate, and there would Jbe no lack of proficients in the art of producing gony. Wbile T am upon this subject of piracy let me mention that an A merican, named Eli Boggs, was tried at Hongkong on Wednesday last for piracy aud murder. His name would do for a villain of the blackbeard class, but in form and feature he -was the hero of a sentimental novel; as he stood in ihe dock, bravely battling for his life, it seemed impossible that that handsome boy could be the pirate -w hose name had been for three years connected with the boldest and bloodiest acts of piracy. It was a -fce of ferninine beauty. Not a dcown upon the upper lip, large listrous eyes, a mouth the smile of which 2night woo coy maiden, affluent black hair not carelessly parted, hands so small and so delicately white -that they would create a sensation in Belgravia - such Was tho Hongkong pirate, Eli Borgs. He spoke for two hours in his defence, an d he spoke vwell-without a tremor, witbout an appeal for muercy, bilt trying to prove that his pro3ecution was -the rersult of a conspiracy wherein a Chinese buma- boat propr-ietor and a sub-official of the colony {both nof w hom he charged as being in league with all the pirates on the coast) were the chief conspirators. The defence was, of course, false. It had been proved that he had boardedajunk and destroyed by cannon, pistol, -nd sword fifteen men; and that havin g forced all the rest overboard he ha d fired at o ne of the victims, who haad clutched a rope and held on astern. No v itness, however, could prove that he saw a maan die from a blow or a shot struck or fired by the pirate. The jury, moved by his youth and courage, and straining hard their consciences, acquitted him. of the murder, but found himn guilty of piracy. He was sentenced to be transported for life. I record this trial, not because this young ruffian is a dandy as well as a cutthroat, but because the subject of piracy is of great importance while dealing with this country, and must form an article of our new treaty. WVhere I now write there are 200 junks lying in the harbour before me, and every one of them is armed with at least two heavy guns-some have 12. Probably one quarter of these are pirates, who live principally by piracy, and adopt the coasting trade only as a cover to their real profession; at leasit one other quarter are not proof against temptation and a weak victim. It requires great bharity or credulity to believe that all the junks that compose the other half are honest traders. The opinion here iz that an armed Chinese junk is aln ays a pirate when opportunity offers. This state of things cannot be tolerated. Every one of these vessels must be disarmed, and some arrangement must be made whereby the cruisers of the Chinese Government shall be distinguishable by, arnd be made to act in concert with, the cruisers of the European Powers. Every country is bound to protect its coasts. Although approached through four miles of shallow and tuirbid water, Macao looks well from the sea. A semicircle of large white houses glitters in the sunshine. Right and left two hills, crowned with forts and covered with foliage, prote^t either horn of the crescent; while from the dense city behind domes and cathedral towers rise. But it is the ipptarance of a past greatness. If we except the houses of the Praja, " fuit" is written upon every wall. This dwindling, dying city, has recently, how.-vt r, shown some signs of life. There are 60 vessels in the harbour; the rice for famishing Canton comes this way. Some of the Cantonese merchants have established themselves here, and every one of our commercial magnates of Hongkong has a bungalow within t e protection of the Portuguese guard. Round a point about four miles away lies the Raleigh, sunk now to her upper deck. The Nankin has succeeded in getting the ruasts out of her. In her yellow paint and her dismasted state she looks like one of the hulls at Sheerness. They have offered her for sale, but the sum bid for her ($5,200) was not worth the risk of keeping a ship of war upon an unsafe station at the typhoon season, and this precaution would be necessary to protect the purchaser. The present idea is to blow her up. Macso is open to the sea breeze, which Victoria is not. Macao possesses the grave of Camoens, which may be an important fact to some people. But I agree with the American poet, who has pencilled upon the tomb,- "I can't admir grat Camoens with ease, "Because I cant speak Portugnew-." Macao also has shady gardens and pleasant waUls and rides, and is the only place where the poor Hongkongian can go to change his atmosphere. There is a mandarin in the neighbourhood of this place who ought to be made to feel that England has a long arm. He has organized a system of coercion upon the Chinese of Hongkong. He keeps regular returns of their names and their gains, and he levies taxes upon them. Once he has withdrawn them altogether. He works upon them by means of their relations, many of whom reaide in his district. When something of the same sort was done by the mandarin at Cowloon Sir John Bowring sent a boat's crew and brought him to Hongkong, where he read him a long lecture and sent him back to behave better. This experiment ought to be repeated. If we cannot protect these people they will not respect us. Such, up to the 2d of this month, were our resources in the absence of news from England, and in our ignorance of the wreck of the Erin. With these rare exceptions we sit in a half torpid state upon our verandahs, or, if we have none, then on the club verandah, and wait till the sun goes down and the notables of the place come forth for their halfhour's exercise. The booming of guns gives token that General Ashburnham is exchanging civilities with the French and American navies. General Garrett appears on his Penang pony-strong nerved old man, who alone, of all the new comers, has affronted the first burst of the climate without suffering a day's ilness, who tells of Peninsular sieges aud Crimean battles just as an iron column would record them; their dates are written in lines upon its front, but it is tough and unworn as when first set up. Colonels Pakenham and Wetherall are walking together in very good preservation, and doubtless think this Chinese affair a very smal matter after the battles before Sebastopol. Colonel Lugard is mneditating deep things about mysteries wlhich I attempt not to fathom, for Colonel Lugard is the head of the Engineers. I wish he would think it necessary for some military purpose to drive a tunnel through this 17ictoria mountain and let in the south-west monsoon. Major Macdonald, who so promptly put Balaklava to rights, has been at his desk all day, and is stretching right away for a rapid walk. There are others whose names are scarcely less known to despatches, but qpes 9tlutC persc-ilbere lon gum est. The ladies of the colony are coming forth sparingly in palanquins or in pony chairs, and some of the residents are dashing by in light four-wheeled match carts, as though they could not get quick enough over their two mniles of ground. The portico of the club has its groups o' lookers-on, andin the haU there is a little crowd surrounding the ice pails-for ices at Hongkong must be eaten between 6 and 4 o'clock, or not at all. Suddenly from the mouth of the harbour comes the sound of guns. WVe have scarcely applied ourselves to count them when the Calcutta opens in reply, fires 19 times in measured succession; then, after a pause, seven more. There can be no doubt any longer-the great man has arrived. The sun is down and the weather has changed, the wind whistles and the rain descends; but most of us wait to catch a glimpse of the topmasts of the Shannon as she steams steadily into port and comes to anchor alongside of the flagship. Lord Elgin has arrived in perfect health. Two days were given to receptions on board. On the third he landed under salute from all the ships and from the fort, and the troops were turned out, and there was a gala day, and Sir John Bowring conducted him through a line of soldiers to Government-house, where he now remains a guest, and where dinner parties, levees, and ad. dresses are the order of the day. We have therefore a Plenipotentiary whom all yarties hope and believe to be the man for the occasion; and we have leaders who, if ordered to do so, would take 10,000 men through China from the Yellow Sea to the Himalaya, but we have not got the 10,000 men. It was very evident that Lord Elgin's position will not allow him to remain idle in Hongkong, and no one was surprised when the rumour spread that he was going northward. The favourite theory is that he is going to Japan, and it is not impossible that we may see the coasts of that mysterious island. The course really resolved upon, however, is this. A few days after this mail has been despatched the Calcutta, the Shannon, the Pearl, the Inflexible, the Hornet, znd two gunboats will proceed northwards, lba rendezvous at Shanghai, and to proceed thqe to the mouth of the River Pei-ho,-on which river Pekin, stands.; AsVived at the nearest poinu to the capital, Lord Elgin :will despatch to the authorities, for transmission to the Emperor, a letter requiring the Emperor within a specified time either to recognize or to repudiate the acts of his officers at Canton. If the Court of Pekinrepudiate Yehand pay compensation forpast injuriesand givesecurityagainsttheir recurrence-well. If, as is most probable, either no notice be taken of the letter or a disposition be shown to entangle the ambassador in questions of ceremonial, Lord Elgin will declare war and thus relieve the relations of the two Powers from their present anomalous position. Canton will then be occupied, the, trade of thenorthern ports will not be unmecessarilyinterfered with, but such further proceedings will be taken as may be necessary to bring the Court of Pekin to reason. Sach is, I believe, the. intended policy. Under other circumstances I should question it most hostilely. It is full of risks. It seems to give authority to the mischievous notion that a Power which refuses to be one of the comity of nations is entitled to all the courtesies and forms of intercourse which civilized nations maintain among themselves. It affords an opportunity for the exercise of diplomatic cunning, which may compel Lord Elgin either to fail in his mission or to adopt a tone of decision which may be readily represented as a rudeness. It affords a loophole for dscape from a position which will not recur. The answer to those considerations, however, is this :-We must do something, and we have not force to do what we ought to do. Lord Elgin, therefore, will either go direct to Pekin and conclude a treaty or he will come back and occupy Canton. In the interest of a durable peace all the Europeans here hope that the latter will be the course which events will take. Many people think that there could be no difficulty in carrying on our corrective measures in 'India and our wvar with China at the same time. Thereare doubtless Sepoy regiments which, although not openly in revolt, are not trustworthy in action against their co-religionists. Why not send them to China ? Sepoys have already been upon the heights above Canton and behaved admirably. The sun of China, under which our ruddy Engliesh recruits grow feeble, Rs flies in frost, would deal tenderly with the HIindoo. So it was .when Gough took Canton and Elliot sold his conquest. So it would be again. I believe the only objection to this obvious and ready expedient is the expense. If you bring Indian troops here you must put all the Queen's troops upon Indian allowances. Now, the difference between the pay of an Indian regiment and a regiment of Queen's troops is something under 4,0001. a-year-not the price of the freight of a cargo of useless shoes or the waste upon an idle transport-not enie-hundredth part the cost of the Transit and the Urgent. Set against this the fact that the rations of Eriglish troops here will cost the Government about 3s a-day, while the rice and curry of the Hindoo, even with the addition of the ration of mutton or goat's-flesh to the Mahommedan soldiers, cannot al erage above Is., and we shall soon find the apparent saving absorbed. Suppose we had 10 regiments in the field, and that 40,0001. was paid in extra pay-a most extravagant .uggestion-wbat is that sum in the general expenses of a war? I confe.s that I should feel some consolation under such an increase by the knowledge that the money would go, not into the pockets of meat preservers and hay preservers, shipowners, and contractors, but into 'he hands of the men who do the work, and who are certainly not at present overpaid for what lhey do. While I am upon this subject let me say a word about the withdrawal of the field allowance. Under existing regulations officers absent from England in localities where war is either pending or anticipated are allowed a small sum to cover their extra et. penses, their pony hire for baggage, their mess utensils and increased expenses, perhaps also the extra cost to which they are put for clothing to suit the hot or cold climate u which they may be placed. A subaltern get, Is. Gd. a-day extra, a captain half-a-crown. ThM is called field a'lowance, and here at Hongkong would be altogether inadequate to put an officer upon a par with his comrade in England. The vwithdrasval of this is a great injustice in a littla matter. I believe the disallowance is illegal, and can only be supported by altering the terms of the order. It is, moreover, in breach of Lord Pan inure's public promise. But, at any rate, it is an unworthy thing to do. Unfortunately, there are not a few officers in our army who have so narrow a margin between their income and their necessities that the loss of this small daily sum is a los of comforts hard to be resigned. I promised last mail to send you some description of Canton in a strategic point of view. There is now no prospect of an immediate attack upon this city, yet it is impossible to foresee what may happen before the expedition returns south. I send you, therefore, what, by personal observation and the examination of many British and Chinese, I have been able to obtain on this subject. People who have never seen an unadulterated Eastern city are apt to entertain very erroneous ideas upon the subject. When we are told of a city of a million of inhabitants we begin to think of the Rue Rivoli. or of Regent-street, or of the Corso, or f the French buildings and Mloorish palaces at Algiers, or, at least, of the great squares of Alexandria or the European quarter at Cairo. We must put European houses entirely out of the question when we thinik of the pure and uncontaminated city of Canton. With the exception of the pagodas there is not in the whole city an edifice as high as the lowest house in Holywell-street. The mass of babitations are about 15 feet high, and contain tlree rooms; they have one entrance, closed by a bamboo screen. Some of the shops have a low upper story, and thenthe house, roof and terrace altogether, may rise 25 feet from the street. Better houses there are, but they are not more lofty. They are detached, stand upon their own little piot of land, and are surrounded by a 12-foot wall. Then there are the palaces, residences of great officials and rich merchants, the " yamuns" of governors and generals, and judges. These are large, low, airy buildings, situated in gardens extensive enough to be called parks-excellent barracks and camping. ground for British Grenadiers. All these edifices are of the most fragile description, built of soft brick, wood, or mud; no hopeful shelter to the most desperate courage. They would be traversed by Mini6 baUs and pierced by grape; they would be knocked into ruins by half-spent round shot; they would be burst by shells. Heroes could not hold them against an advancing column C f English troops, annd as to Chinese, the first bullet that whistled down the street would be an intimation of an intended line oI march which soldier and eivilian would immediately respect. The whole circuit of the walled city is just six miles. It is necassary to bear in mind the character of the buildings of this place, or we shall find ourselves talking nonsense about " involving ourselves in the intricacies of a city of a million of people." Sevendials would be a strong military post; but Greenvich Fair would not offer great strategic opportunities of derence. General Gough made hiz attack with 2,600 fighting men, having left Hongkong protected only by a few native Indian troops. We have now in this island and in thess vateys about 4,000 sailors, 500 Mariea, ar& ASOI healthy goldiera of the -land Â£otce. Tli Bsnajsi4w.' whicth ls*;left \'inga. pore and is now m.omentarily expected, will bring us 500 more Marines. General Gough's attack took place in the hot rainy season-on the 18th of May-and if be had entered the city he would not have lost a man by disease. On the other hand, the recollections of General Gough's difficulties have led to the present war. The Cantonese remnember that while he was waiting for the black n;iail he was attacked by " patriotic volunteers," who surrounded part of his force and put it to great difficulties. They remember also that these " patriotic volunteers" were not svept away by barbarian cannon, but were coaxed away by. the Chinese autborities, who acted under threat of a bombardment of the city. This capital error in morals and in policy, this egregious mistake of that gallant, eager, wrong-headed little nan, Admiral Elliot; thisunworthy money-grasping, ransom-taking policy has produced the present war. Since that day the Cantonese look upon us as robbers and booty seekers whom it is right to exsterminate when they can; whom they could thrash if they pleased, but whom they can always get rid of by tossing to us a heap of. silver. So they pointed derisively at us whenever they saw us; they called out afteruB "Tah" ("beatthem),"and "Shft" ("behead them"); they encouraged each otherto acts of violence, and they wrought that intolerable condition of things which makes it necessary for us by more imposing force and by higher conduct to take an attitude of dignity-to show these Cantonese that we are not petty pirates and plunderers like themselves, but a mighty necessity for good and for evil which to them is irrq,istible as natural death. - We must do strong violence now, because we bave been weak aud foolish in time past. Bat what we do we must do throughly. A single reverse and we should have either to withdraw from these shores or to overrun half the empire. I am not resting a feather weight upon my owvn judgment when I affirm that with our present force we could take this city in six hours. But I cannot resist the weight of the authority which says that we could not hold it as we ought to hold it. Great genius might doubtless multiply small means. I have heard it said by men whose deeds give them light to talk, that 500 men relieved once a-fort. night ought to hold the city for six months. Perhaps the ships could find occasion for keeping the inhabitants of the 96 villages at home; it was they who attacked General Gough upon the heights, and the terrible threat of a bombardment is always open. Tbe probabilities are that after the first day the city would be as tranquil as this city of Victoria. The Chinese shopkeepers here say, " You catchee citee; we open shop balf hour after." But this is only a probability. Were it not for the danger of the insurgents being beforehand with us precipitation would be madness. Even with this danger impending it would not do to run the risk of finding ourselves in Canton with an inadequate force daily dwindling from overwork and disease. JIULY 10. Lord Elgin's asmwer to the address has just been printed, and I annex a copy. The address was sent to you by a previous maiL "Gentlemen,-I am much gratified by the welcome waich you are pleased to proffer to me on my arrival at Hong. kong. " I am asware of the deep interest which yon have in the Je-establishment of a solid pe&ce, and of the weight which deservedly attaches to your opinion,-not only on the poinf3 specifically adverted to in this address, but also on the larger question of the re-adjustment of our relations with the Chinese Empire. I shall therefore at all times listen with attc- tion and respect to any representations which you. may see fit to maLe to me on these subjects, although the in. terests of the public service forbid that I should discuss the instructions with which our Soser6igu has honoured me, or the course vhich, in pursuance of those instructions, it is my Intention to pursue. " Without, however, departing from the reserve which a sense of duty prescribes to me, I may venture to state that I concur with you in the opinion that no settlement of our 1resent difficulties will be satisfactory which shall fail to teah the Cantonese a wholesome respect for the obligation; of their own Government in its relations with independent Powers, and for the laws of hospitality towards strangers who resort to their shores for peaceful purposes of trade. "1 The powerful fleet already assembled on these coasts, which will soon be supported by an adequate nilitary force, is a pledge of Her Majesty's determination to afford protecto her faithful subjects in this quarter, and to maintain the rights to which they are by treaty entitled. "It is essential to the permanence of pacifie reations with China, and to the security of trade, that the Court of Peldn should be apprised that an arrogant refusal to treat wth other Powers on the terms prescribed by the comity of natic ns, or the alleged wilfulnessof a provincial authority, will not henceforth be held to release it from the responsibity of faithfully adhering to engagements contracted with indepencsent and sovereign States. "you. refer in language of mucoh force and justice to the diffioultits which beset the mission on which I am entering. I am not insensible to those difficulties. But Inowing as I do that ths Government wfhich i serve is pursuing no selfish objects, that we may count on the cordial sympathy and active cc-operation of other great and generous nations, interested with ourselves in the spread of commrce and the extension of civilization-knowing,moreover, the valour and discipline of the forces, both military and naval, which, under able and experienced commanders, are prepared, if need be, to support the honour of our country's flag,-I see no reason to doubt that, by prudence and patience, moderation and firmness, they may be overcomne. "To Messrs. Jardine, Matheson, and Co., " Dent and Co., and others. "Hongkong, July S." This answer has been closely scanned, and those who hold that the Chinese will promise anything or s;gn any treaty under pressure, but will be influenced only by seeing that we can thrash these terrible Cantonese, do not like the words " if need be" in the last paragraph. Others, however, and these are the majority, both in number and in weight, think that we must not too soon vex the con- duct of our Ambassador with hostile criticism. He has a difficult task to perform, his responsibility will be terrible should he fail, and he ought to be allowed to play his own game. Even the more eager and impatient admit that it was necessary that he should go north to see the present ports and hold talk with the merchants whose interests he is to represent. I I
CAUTIOIN TO SPORTSmm-.-The late lamentable and fatal accident to Mr. T. Platt, the Liberal memiber for Oldham, is one of those oocorrences vwith whioh the shooting season is but too often ushered in. Next Tuesday will, no doubt, witness the debut of many a youthful sportsman, who, amid his zeal for the destruction of partridges, wonld do weU to remember the sad loss of life which has recently taken place. The constant observance of one or two very simple roles would be sufficient to prevent this class of accidents. The first and most obvious is never to carry the gan with the muzzle pointed, not merely at, but in the direction of, any buman being. The second is that all parties in 'he field should vwalk as much in a line as possible, carrying their guns either on the shoulder or under the arm, not swinging across it, as is too commonly done, tbereby bringing ihe trigger into dangerous proximity vith coat or waistcoat buctons. In the next place the hammer should always be at half-cock-, except at the very moment when game is expected to rise. 1n the act of firinthe young sportsman should alisays remember that he mtut never shoot at a bird unless the coast Is perfectly clear; and in loading that he must avoid hanging over the muzzle of his gun, and never allow his hand or fingers to cover it. Shnpie and obvious as these precaucautions appear, it is astonisintg 'what .a niaaber of even xperienced persona neglect them, dangling tlm'ir guns asthey walk with the trigger at fufll cock, and the rsusses covermng their-dearesifriend dead witbiu a dozen paces; leaning over the barrels as they load, aud firing recklesslywhen birds isc, whether any one iY in the way or zot. It nmay possiblyr be of some use at this periodof the yst to fix our readers' minds upon the point. On s trite and commonsense a subject ntothing very newercan. be said.

bSTA TEVTYBB VEINTION IN T?HE IfLl G1O. OF INDJ.A. TO TaBE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-A few days ago, a Kulin Brahiniu-one of the astutest of his race, whom I have known for the last quarter of a century-calied on me. "I HAve you noticed," asked he, " vrhat Lard EUenborough has been saying in the House of Lords about the cause of the Sepoy mutinies?" "Yes, I have," was the curt rely. " Did you ever," added he abruptly, and with emphasis,--" Did you ever see such nonsense? W Why, there is not a sensible native in all India but will see through it and laugh at it, while the disaffected fwill be sure to employ it as a handle for exciting, among the ignorant, fresh fears and alarms." The shriswd Brahmin, profoundly conversan-t with the feelings of his owa countrymaea, wan right. "Oar rulers," continuied he, "do not yet seem to know the people of this country. What they fear is not instruction or discussion, for they are rather fond of, both in religious matters; but the Mahommedan-like use of force-the doings of Mahmoud of Ghuznee, Timur, and Aurangzebe have frightened them. Bat so long as force is iot used they do not care hown many instructors of your religion may be working peaceably among thern, nor bow much money may be subscribed in India or elsewhere for their support, nor who the subscribers may be,-whether you, or any other British gentlemnan, or the Governor-General, or Queen Victoria herself." Again wxs the shrewd Brahmin right, expressing in few words the innermost convictions of his people. In illustration of this it may be stated that only the other day the Brahmin editor of,Â£ perhaps, the ablest and most popular of our Bingalee nerspapers furnished his readers with an engraving of a new edifice for the largest missionary educational intitution in Calcutta, accompanied with an elaborate eulogy of the zeal and activity of its founder, the liberality of the subscribers for its erection, and the perfect fairness of its conductors, who, though they fully taught the doctrines of Christianity, resorted to no compulsory means, but left all freely to follow the convictions of their own minds. 'Again," added my old friend the Brahmin, "there is another point on which our rulers seem to be utterlly mistsken. It is this, the great mass of the:E3indoo population have no intelligent persuasion as to the principles of their own religion. It is with them a matter of immemorial tradition, mythological legend, outward form and ceremony, civil and social usage. Their life is made up of a ceaseless round of rites, forms, and customs, all, in their estimation, more or less sacred. lere the Government bylaw-that is, practicaUy by force-to avoolish any long-established rite, form, or custom; were it, for example, to order the pDrth (or sacred Brahminiicai thread) to be worn on the right, instead of the left shoulder, or the dhSooti (a piece of cloth round the waist) to be diff'erently tied, or the marriage of mere infants to be declared illegal, or the mfarriage ceremtony to be performed on unilucky days, such interference would create a far more intensesensation and alarm than any amount of voluntary subscriptions for the peaceful establishtaent of Christian schools or preaching bungalows in every district or vilage throughoutthe land." Such was the dehberate judgment of the expe rienced long-headed Brahmin; and, surely, on such a subject he must be accontted by the whole world a more trustworthy authority than the Earl of Ellenborough. Contrast, then, the statements of the former wsith the views expressed by the latter! The Brahinin did not for a moment hesitate in declaring that these views, so far from being well founded, could not fail to be received by every sensible native in India with shouts of derision. That this must be the case I am thoroughly satisfied from all that I have ever seen or heard of native sentiment and feeling. He must, indeed, proclaim his own ignorance wlho does not know that the Hindoos, left to themselves, are, speculatively at least, the most tolerant of religionists. To the labours of individual missioparies of the Christian or any other faith who are not cursed withlthe intolerant, iconoclastic spirit they never object. And, thongh almost all parts of India hav -nowv teenpevided lby itinerants, who ever hears of a Christian missionary being hooted, iasulted, or peltedwith mud and stones, as George Whitefield often was in civilized and nonainalby Christian England? Yea, rather, is there a missionary of note in India, from Schwartz down,ards, who cannot point to the kindly reception he has met with in the palaces of Zemindars and Rajahs, and the amicable religious diecussion to which he has there been invited? Away, then, with the idle and ceaseless surmise that the pacific labours of the missionaries, or any subscriptions of the GovernorGenerel, or of any others, have had anything wnatever to do with the origination of the recent deplorable mutinies. IMoreover, I have yet to learn that the GovernorGeneral has subscribed to any of our directly missionary societiea. He has, indeed, subscribed to thle " City Mission ;" but that, like the London City Mission, is designed exclusively for the lapsed and sunken among the nominally Christian population of Calcutta. Ie has subscribed to one or two of our more popular missionary educativnal institutions; but these are of the number that are entitled any day, by the terms of the Educational Despatch which emanated from the Board of Control and Court of Directors, to a grant-i,-aid from the Government itself, if they only choose to apply for it. These very harmless contributions, so far as I can learn, cover the whole extent of Lord Canning's offending. But, even if his Lordship had been less careful and scrupulous than he has been in selecting the objects of his bounty; had he been led to subscribe to every one of our charitable and religious societies, no man ever more egregiously missed the mark than did Lord Ellenborough in asserting or insinuating that his doing so could be among the exciting causes of the disaff&ction and reb&llious outbreak in the Bengal army. In point of time or place there muight be a coi,tcid'enu, in point of causutioz there could be no connexion wvatever. And the hypothesis of Lord Ellenbsrough is only fit to lie ranked in the same category wvith that which would snake Tenterden steeple the cause of the Goodwin sands; or a solar eclipse the cause of the celebrated piague at Athens; or the breaking up of the Polar ice in spring the cause of the last dissolution of the British Parliament. It is an undoubted fact that the instigators of the present rebellion were several months ago indtustriously propagating cver all India the wicked delusion that the Britieh. h ernmoent was bent on interfering w;ith the caste of the natives, and forcibly poselytizing them to the Christian faith. B;ut to w hat evidence was the appeal made in support of a, all7'icious a fiction? To tha3 u-r~apAmnoAna ,sf n ie sionary societies? No, never. To the GovernorGeneral's subscriptions to charitable or religious societies ? i0o, never. To what, then? Solelyto acts of the Governor-General in council, such as that of Lord William Benitinck in abolishing the rite of suttee, or that of Lord Dalhousie in altering the law of inheritance so as to secure libertv of conscience; to acts of the recently constituted Legslative Comacil, such as that which has removed the illegality of widow marriage; or, lastly, to acts of the miltary au:horities, such as the introduction of the use of a cartridge supposed to c ntain the caste-breakig ingredients of Cow's fat and hog's lard- But, long ere nowr, it must be patent to Lord Ellenborough himself that th eaust of thu present rebellion lies much deeper than the shalow one -which he surmised; aye, &asd rwh deeper than all t.he mnore pLausible ones no* caunzrated, sard Ot-ber of like kind, put togJether.it.

Such is the spirit, such the olbeat, suck h e battle-cry of the leaders of this foul and sag*s,wry revolt.

" Thew oran," y .one df the 2ahononmeda hkistorians, " declares that the. highest glory man can attain in thiis world i--, .unquestionably, that of wagiag wecesfol var bgainst the enemies of his eligion. " Accordingly, huw ofcen do we read in Maaomuedan narratÂ±vet of warriurs hasterning to the doomed cities of unbtlievers, that they m:gnit " share iii tbe meriit of ewnding their sotls zo the abyss of hell!" How often (lo we read of tneir sparing neither old nren nor youDg children, neither rich nor poor, male nor female, and of scores of pyramide being made of their heads for truphies ! ;Now, this ess!:ntial spirit of lilam mray be held ixm check, as in 'Turkey, by the European Powers, or it 3may be kept uinder repression, as in Isdia, by the parimount British power; but nowhere is it real y extinguished. WYholly remove the check or the repressive intluence, whether in Turkey or in India, iid the old spirit of hatred, revenge, and slaughter ot the ua.7'e,'or iluhdei, is sure to burst forh with a. violence proportioned to the period during which. it bas been chained down by thte coercton of auperiwr force. TTpwards of a dozen years ago the late Sir WlliamL Sleeman, who, perhaps, more than any other mass of his day, had mingled freely with the natives and gained timeir confidence, remaked in one of hLi. woris that "the Mahommed-ans in India Â£igh for. the restoration of the old Mahommedan rgirne." ." We pray," said they. "every night for the Emperor aud his faiiily. because our foref"athers at:> of the salt of his forefathers." As the result of personal inquiry I am enabled to state positively that for nearly the last 100 years daily prayers have been oflered 1U the mosques throughout India for the House of Timnur and the re-establishment of the King of Delhi on the throne of his ancestors-a fact, probably, which at this moment' is wholly unk-nowrn to the British rulers of this laud! Such having been aUl along the unquenched and unquenchable spirit of Mahomnmedanmsm in India, the introductiou of the new rifle cArtridge came opportunely to the aid of the conspirators. Adroitly and eagerly was the occasion seized on, in order to, awaken and alarm the religious prejudices of the poor, ignorant, superstitious Sepoys. Suspicion being once awakened, their all-devouring credulity readily swallowed not only the distorting references to the past acts of the Governor-Genreral aud the Legislatve Council, but also the wildly extravagan' and utterly incredible fiction respeLting a new cLusade against their faith, in which conspicuously figured the names of Lord Palmerston and Queen Victoria. The great bulk of the Sepovs, and especially the Hindoo portion of them, must thus be regarded in the first instance as merely the dupes of more knowing and evil-designing men-:nen whotook base, but skilful advantage of their superstitious foibles and weaknesses, in order to cenvert them into tools for the executionl of their owrn political projects of reconquest and domuinion. The exasperation of the 3d Cavalry at Meerut on beholding so manY of their comrades, not more guilty than themselves, subjected to tte indignity of being put in irons before their eyes, and committed to gaol to work there as felons, doubtless precipitated the evolution of a plot which was not then quite ripe in all its parts. Henee the piecemeal and apparently desultory character of the mutinies which have successively broken out in different and widely distant stations. So much the better for us. For had the plot not somewhat prematurely e:ploded, so as to frastrate the ful design of its authors, the historians of British India might ere now have had to record not merely the outbreak of partial but bloody massacres in divers places, but the downfall of the British power and absolute extermination of theBritishpeople from Cape Comorin to the Him2alayas. UJnder the paramount swasy of redtapeism and old ivilianisin it was fatuously conlcluded that the caged tiger had been wrheedled, cajoled, coaxed, petted, and pettled into tameness and civility. Bat recent events have too plainly proved that the instant the tiger is uncaged he spring6 on his patrons and protectors with a fieree and devouring energy. Assuredly more than one generation must pass away ere the almost unheard-of barbarities practised by ihe "stanch and loyal'" traitors of the native army on unarmed and helpless men, women, and children,can be effaced from the memory. Lord Ellenborough's favourite and oft-reiterated maxim, 5" 13y the sword we have gained India, and by the sword we must retain it," will now be universally re-echoed, though in a significantly modified form. " By the Britioh sword we have gained Iniia, and by the British sword we must, for many a year, retain it," must henceforth be the shout of indignant nillions. Away, then, with starched red-tapeism and effte eivilianism, rith their empty pomnp and big swelling pretensions, their affected iiiuesse and supercilious arrogance. Let us have at once a loval British instead of a treacherous Sepoy armv; and, though the cost of the individual soldier will be greater, oseethird the aggregate number of the present native armay wil suffice to keep in awe the aisaftected and tulrbulent spirits throughout this vass reg, n. Let India for years to come be ruled as an) 9iver Cromwell would have ruled it, mngling tbl. stern decision and promptitude of the despot with the considerate blandness and equity of the ptriot. Let our unrivalled British soldiers be under a competent military governance, and not under the dictatorship of a ceatralized, all monopolizing civilianism Letour vorthlessand infamnos police,reconstitiited on a military model, have a large infusion in the ranks of its officers of meritorious. British sergeants and soldiers. Let our civil and criminal courts, with their intolerable machinery of' corruption and chicane, be swept away, root and brarch; and let us have justiceadministered by really qualified judges in simple and summary ways, adapted tothe peculiarities of au iguorant, superstitious, demoralized people, who hlave yet to learn that truth is morebonourable tban a lie, and that forms of lawr are designed to shield the weak and the ineocent, and not invariably to let the powerful and the guilty go free. Let l;ritish capitalists, no longer frowned upon and hunted down as inwirlopers by high mightinesses " dressed ia a little brief autho-- rity," be freely invited and largely encouraged. to settle in the interior, there to form the rallying points of an improved civilization, and the nuclei of British loyalty and augmentiag British strength. Let works o. sakill and enrerprise, capable of drawing' forth the exlhaustless resourcea of a land so prolific of hidden treasures be everywhere stimulated by. the, hearty patronage of a wise and benefioent Govern- k-ind which has infl%ted 'voung Bengal" with. vanity and sel-fic1it-but education generous. and complete, which, in the menmorable words of, Wilton, "Ihts a man to peribrm j ustly, skilfully, and. *nananimously all the oSices, both private and. .public, of peace and -wa-be iiffiused with no sparing hand through th% multiWdinous masies of this many-raced peowle.

The latest telegraphic deapatch from Constant!nople, dated yeaterday, does not announce the resuraption of diplomatic relations between the Porte and the four Powers. All that wa waited for wa the comnplete constitution of the new Miniatry. MD de Thouvenel has had an audience of the Sultan. Despatches from the French Consul at Tunis announce that the Bey has granted the full satisfaction demas.ded of him for the recent outrages on Euro. peana. They add that his Govermment is so weak that similar excess may be expected to occur again, and that it is emential to take measures for the future protection of foreigners. The D6bats contains a budget o. misellaneous intelligence from Senegal and the French West India Islands. In Upper Senegal the Mahomedan chief, El Hadj Omar, after having been twice repulsed ill fierce attacks on the fort of M6dine, had announced his intention of taking it by famine. lie had also proclaimned throughout Senegambia and Guinea that, when he should have finished with Senegal, he woulld attack Gambia, Goree, and all the establishments on the West Coast of Africa, whence he was resolved to expel the Europeans Meanwhile he has been detained two months by a fort of no great strength, into which, notwithstandiDg the blockade, supplies have been thrown, and to which relief was sent in July. From Guadaloupe we learn that the first cargo of African labourers had arrived by Ithe ship Phcenix. She left the coast of Africa with 296 on board, and lost 14 on the passage, which lasted 39 days. The Administration of Guadaloupehad been informed by the Minister of Marine that "1 two ships belonging to the house of 116gis, the Stella andtie Olra, vwere about to sail from Mareilles, to recruit on the West Coast of Africa the 1,200 or 1,500 emigranta that house had undertaken to supply in the oourse of 1857." The Duke de Rivas had a long interview on Friday with Count Walewskl, and i said to have declared that, before prooeeding to hostilities with Mexico, the Spanish Government would publish a manifebto, explaining the question at issue, and permitting the Mexican Goverment to open fresh negotiations. Although accounts are conflicting with respect to the exact course the Spanish-Mexican dispute is taking, and as to the manner in wrich it is likely to be arranged, it is pretty evident that all danger of collision between the two Powers is over for the present. As regards the final settlement, that, considering the national character of the disputants, may possibly be long. But fears for Cuba wiU restrain Spain from carrying out those warlike threats of which her press and some of her legialators were lately so lavish. T'he name given to the medal granted to the survivors of the old Imperial armies excites, as might be expected, some comment and surprise. It is certainly not generally approved. To say nothing of ita recalling unfriendly souve.nirs, it is thought very odd that a French decoration should receive the name of an English possession. The denomination originally proposed by the Ministr of War and approved b} the EmpIeror was, "The Medal of the Old Army.' It was quite unexpectedly that the Moniitewr announ ced that it was to be called "the Medal of St. Helena. " I am assured that the number of claimants for it will be far larger than might be expected - but the shortest period of service in the Imperial armirs suffices to entitle to it, and it must be remomebered with what mere boys the first Napoleon was at last driven to recruit his legions. In a recent Council of Ministers M. Abbatucci expressed himself in termrs of great indignation with respect to the abuses in Algeria that have been revealed on the trial of Captain Doineau and the Arab culprits. Marshal Vaillant, in reply, endeavoured to extenuate the matter, observing that in judginig it we m-ust not look at it exactly from the European point of view, but make some allowance for the peculiar circumstances of a recently conquered country, for the oharacter of the people to be dealt with, &c. A mixed Commisson has been appointed to draw up a plan, to be sabmitted to the Emperor, for the reorganization of the Arab bureaux. It seems to be considered impossible to dispense with them, but a less military character will probably be given to them. It is still reported that Generals Montauban and Beaufort will be removed from their present commands in consequence of the scandal this affair has occasioned. A newspaper said the other day that Paris was left without a Parisian. It is no exaggeration to say that it is left without a single inhabitant who can po.sibly escape from It. Summer, suspended for a few days, has returned to us as% vigorously as if it were its first appearance this year. Hot though it be, people dare not complain of such glorious weather, especially as the knowing ones prognosticate a vintage of such quality as has not been known since the year of the great comet; but they gladly fly from heated asphalte to sea baths and fresh pastures. Dieppe and Trouville, Vichy and Biarritz, overflow, while here the throng upona the Boulevards has lost its lustre; s.carcely an equipage is to be seen in the Bois do Boulogne, and m vain the Pre Catalan throws wide its portals, lights up its 1O0,000 lanterns, arrays its dancers on rural stages, and illuminates the department with its blue lights and rockets. Paris has gone abroad, andthe foreigner reigns undisputed master of the territory. it is a complete invasion, customary at this season, chiefly of birds of passage, who often come for only a day, but manage to pass a week, rmuch to the comfort of the hotels and resta.rateurs. Great Britain is strongly represented here, especially by healthylooking gentlemen in capacious waistcoats, who seem to pass most of their time in instituting practical comlparisons betweenVery's, the Trois Freres, and other renowned taverns, and whose patriotic comment usually is that, after all, you get nothing so good here as in London. But it would be hard if men who pay so well, and enjoy such good appetites aud such constant thirst, should not be allowed to grumble while consuming the best of everytbing, and so the Parisians shrug their shoulders indulgently at John Bull's eccentricities wbile pocketing all the coin they can seduce him into parting with. The theatres are dull, as well they may be in August; a French version of Jack S3heppard is successful at the Porte St. Martin, its chief attraction appearing to be a very correct scenic imitation of the fog in which London is supposed to be continualy enveloped; some amusing improprieties are played to empty benches at the Palais Royal; the Grand Opera, ballet-less, ne va que d'unn jurmbc; at the Italian Theatre an actor named Salvini i. magnified by some of the critics into a star of Ristori's magnitude; but there is a diflfrence of opinion on this head. The veteran Dejazet is going to give some representations, and one of her triumphs of former days, Gantil Benard, is to be revived for her; par contre, Levassor is going away. Vivier has gone to BadenBaden, to delight the bathers with his inexhaustible wit and wonderful quadruple notes; Rossini is not composing an opera; the Exhibition of Pictures, which has been extremely successful this year, is to be kept open until the middle of September, in consequenct of the crowds that still flock to it.

The Emperor left Paris yesterday for the camD at Chaslons-sur Mamne.

Almost every German paper oontan an account of the approaching visit of the Emperor Alexander to eneany, but none of them have given oxrect formatim as to his intend-d movein. on the 15th of September His Majesty wit arrive at Beiin, where be will only remain one day. On the tlth h6 Wil join the Empres at Dsmardt, in which cIty she has been staying with her relatives ance the 2Sd inwt. I do not know where the Empero Napoleon and the Emperor Alexander will meet, but it in a positive fact that they have agreed to meet during the month,of September. As it is very possible that those peraons who are inclined to suspet the sincerity of the French monarch may "smell treason," it may be as well to state that it was the Emperor Alexander, and not the Emperor Napoleon, who proposed that a meeting should take place. The good-natured Czar is probably desirous of making the amende honorable for the public and gratuitous insult which his deceased father offered to the " parnte'n" who rules over the PFiench by the grace of the people. The policy of the Austrian Cabinet is sometimes so ecoexsively refined that it far passes my understanding, and such is the case just at present. The Princes Cecilia of Baden was confirmed at St. Petersburg on the 15th inst. according to the rites of the " Orthodox Church." After she had rnade her profesion of faith inthe Russian language the Empeor proclaimed her a Russian GrandDuchess, with the name of Olga Feodorovna. Her marriage with the Grand Duke Michael will take place on the 28th inslt. It has long been remarked that the AustroItalian bishops seem to feel but little gratitude for the numerous and important concessions which have recently been made by the State to the Church, and it is now suspected that they regard with no favourable eye the system of rigid centralization which the Sovereign and his official adviaers consider necessary to the welfare of the empire. It is a wellknown fact that the spirit which animated the Guelphs in the middle ages, and led to their endless feuds with the Ghibellines', is not entirely extinct, and the Austrians are therefore the less surprised to find in the columns of the Bilancia, the organ of the Ultramontane party in Lombardy, a very long article from the Paris Univers, in which the present system of government is condemned, and federation strongly recommended as z panacea for all the evils under which Auesia is now labouring. The article appeared in the French papers just as the E5mperor resumed hiis Hungarian journey; and it need hardly be said that it wfas anything but agreeable to the Austrian Cabinet, which is resolved not to loosen those ties which are to make one compact whole out of a number of heterogeneoua elements. The Hungarian nobles intend to make another attempt to induce the Emperor to comply with their 'wishes; and it is credibly related that another petition is even now preparng. The originators of the petition strongly urge the bishops to sign it; and the following account is given of the behaviourof M. de Rainoido, the Bishop of Wesprim, when a deputation of nobles applied to him for his signature :-The very rev, gentleman, vrho either was, or affected to be, rising from his knees1 as his visitors entered the room, informed them with the greatest possible unction that he had just been holding spiritual commune with the Most high and with St. Gisela on the subject of the petition, and was wiling to sign it. The Archbishop of Vienna has at length observed that the tone of the articles in the Voksfrund is displEasing even to devout Catholics, and be has therefore resolved to form a committee whose duty it will be to examine and revise the different articles which are written for the paper before they are sent to press. It hasnot yet been settled what is to be the fate of the Bergamo Gazette, which was suspended by the Bishop of that citv. The chief political authority of the district and the police-director were unwilling to act on their own responsibility in a matter of such delicacy, and applied to Baron [Burger, the Stadtholder of Lombardy, for instruc- tions. Baron Burger, in his turn, applied to the central power in this city, which took a half-measure, and directed him to endeavour to effect a compromise. The Stadtholder replied, and, as is said, by electric telegraph, that no compromise was possible, as the Bishop either had a right to act as he had done, or he had not. It was for the Central Go. vernmentto decide on that question, and for him to see that its decision was respected. The matter b of extreme importance, for if Government decides in favour of the Bishop it will make a concession to the Churchof which there is no mention in the concordat. There has recantly been a great wailing and lamentation in the Ultramontane circles, because the Prussian Government did not consent to the meeting of the Catholic Associations of Germany at Cologne "until it was too late ;" but the Berlin Cabinet, doubtless, had excellent reasons for not | grsnting the permission demanded until i' had been rmade public that Salzburg was to have the honour I of receiving themlnen whose avowed object it is to spread the Roman Catholic faith from one extremity of the earth to the other. As the excessive influence of Rome is at present confined to Austria and Southern Germany, the Northern States display but common prudence when they endeavour to keep the Ultramontanists at arm's length. When any contagious or infectious disease is raging a cordon is established, and the Protestant States in Germany would perhaps do well to draw a moral one between themselves and the countries which are now suffering under the Roman plaguie. ITALY. (IaoW cern OWN coRsPoNDlENT.) TURIN, AueusT 27. The rise t French diplomatic changes have naturally speculation in Italy as to their signification regarding the policy of the Imperial Government towards Italy for the xuture. While on the one hand the Liberal party flatter tbemselves that the nomination of the Duke de Grammont as representative of the Emperor at the Court of Rome gives promise of the inauguration of that much-desired policy shadowed forth in the well-known letter to Edgar Ney, the Armo'nia and its fellow-labourers find consolation in the fact that even the Liberal Dapera are obliged to describe the appointment of the Duke de Grammont as a promotion, which, says the Armonia, .proves that the Emperor of the French esteems the Government of Rome much more than he does that of Sardinia. A letter received from Bologna this morning says this appointment had raised great hopes among the Liberal party there, and the writer adds that the Pope, in taking leave of the Austrian authorities there, had said " he felt comforted in seeing himself surrounded by brave men, who not only had re-established the Pontifical Throne, but maintained and defended courageously the sacerdotal power against the attacks of lukewarm friends of little faith," which was supposed to be an allusion to the French Government, as the remark was made sbortly after Count de Rayneval had been there to take leave of his Holiness. The Monitore Tosrano of the 24th describes the "function" performed by the Pope in the Church of Santa Maria del Fiore the day previous, of consecrating four new Prelates-viz., the Archbishop of Florence, and the Bishops of Volterra, Montepulciano, and Fietoli-as having been attended with great pomp. The Grand Duke and Duchess, the Dowager Grand Duchess, theHereditaryPrince and Princess, the Archduke Charles, and the Count and Countess of Trapani, as well as all the Ministers of State and the Corps Diplomatique, were present unofficially and in stalls set apart for them. The Pope was seated on a magnificent throne, erected for the occasion, and was asisted in the ceremony by Monsignor Franchi,Arcl bishop of Thessalonica and Papal Interuuncio at tbe Tuscan Court, and by Monsignor Arrigoni, Archbishop of Lucca. After the cere- mony the Pope retired to the apartments of the Chapter, and deigDed to accept a sumptuous breakfast there, and to admit the canons and chaplains to kiss his foot. On returning to the Pitti Palace his Holiness again gave bis benediction to the multitude from the balcony. The next morning (the 24th), at half-past 9, a salvo of artillery announced the departure of the Pope for Pisa. I have good authority for saying that the Pope's reception at Florence has been very much what it was throtughout his journey in his own dominions-that is to say, respectful towards himself as the head of the Church, vwith a strongly-developed curiosity to see a live Pope. I met a friend yesterday who had wit.essed the Pope's reception in several towns of the Marches and Romagna, and also at Modena anid Florence, and he assured me the reception at Modena was the nearest approach to an enthusiastic welcome that he saw, and even there it was very tame. As to the Florentines, he said they crowded in hundredr and thousands to look at the Pope as they would at a 'wild beast, but paid very litte attention to him when once their curiosit had been satified; and though the a~ret.s and open places wero full of people, and the houseu decorated writh flags, grLsnds, tapestry, and other inanimate smbols of rejoicing on the day of his arrival, few people even unovered, and hardly any knelt to reeive his bmai. * The partiqanB of the Emnperors were so denotiunatAd. diction as he pased along. The Court and clergy at Florence had, of course, done their utmost to invest the Papal visit with the air of a triumph for iheir v:ewa and opinions, but, although the priests undoubtedly have great iniluence over certaia clases, the people of Tuscany re by nature far to) acute to be led by the simple di4hm of preachers against the evidenoe of their own senses; and it is maid this visit of the Pope to Tuscany will, therefore, probably have done more to destroy the faith ia Papl infallibility than all the efforts of Protestant or Evangelical mitsionaries could have effected in a century Lord and Lady Norniznby pased through Turin yesterday, on their way to England. His Lordship was hastily summoned by telegraph in consequence of the serious illnes of one of his brothers, and ia expected to return in about six weeks. It is expected that Prince Napoleon will accompany His Majesty King Victor Emmanuel on his return to Tunn from Savoy, after inaugurating the works for the tunnel through Mont Cenis :ad the railway bridge over the Rhone, which are to be the completing links of railway communication between the Italian Peninsula and the north-west of Europe. During his stay here his Imperial Highness will be lodged in the Royal Palae. STATE OF NAPLES. (ISOM OUR OWN COORE3PONDN.) NAPLES, AUG. 2i. I have leart that several alterations of coasiderable interest to the public have been made in the terms of the concession granted to M. de Yormann for laying down a submarine telegraph from Sicily toMalta, and from Sicily to Cape Bon, by the Island of Pantellaria. According to thes alterations each line is to be independent. ,? If, after 15 or 20 years, it be found that the line does not pay the concemion isto be annulled at the will of tIhe concess7wnaire. Despatches through may be sent ia English, French, or Italian, instead of, as at present, only in French or Italian. Lastly, the Government, for secret service, will lay down a separate wire through the kingdom and a separate submarine wire through the Straita at their own expense. Thesa new conditions are all of great importauce, and those who have had any experience in continental telegraphs will well know how to appreciate the permission to send despatches m English. The line of tranmission (to omit smaller intervening places) will be from Malts to Alga Grande, Reggio, Merina, Naples, Rome, Bologna, Modena, Trieste, through Prusia, Holiand, the HIague, and so on to the office in ILothbury. From all that I can hear the undertakinIg is being urged on with considerable activity, a guarantee for which would be the fact that the Electric andIntemational Telegraph Company have taken the matter up, asI have already mentioned. This Government, too, appears to be in earnest, His Majesty having given personal orders to a high officer of his Court to proceed to Sicily and superintend the laying down of the wires across the island to Alga Grande. Similar despatch will be exercised as regards the submarine from Reggio to Mesina, which might have been laid down long ago had it not been for obstacles offered by the semon and by the Government, which pretended to a guarantee from M. de Normann to keep the submarine scure for a year. I believe the conoessiownaire, or, perhaps, the Electric and International, have been in correspondence with the British Government, the India-house,1 and the Oriental and Peninsular Company on the subject of the newlyprojected line, and the best hopes are entertained that their countenance and assistance will be secured.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Several letters have lately appeared in your columns recommending the employment of Negro and Caffre troops in India, on the ground that they are wel suited to the climate, and that, aa they would not participate in the feelings of the native nopulation, they m!ght be expected to adhere faith?uUy to the Government. Those who know the wayward nature of these savage races, how little they are under the influence of reason, and how subject they are to sudden and unaccountable impulses, will doubt whether they could be depended upon under circumstances which would be in the highet degree strange and 'uwildering to their limited faculties. We do not want any instruction in the character of the Caffre, with whomhabits of deceptionare a second nature, who signally failed us on tile only occasion (the Caffre police) on which it has been attempted to make him useful in a military capacity, and whose most recent feat was killing all his cattle in the expectation of an impending general resaurection; but it is not so well known that the West India regiments are composed of the rudest and rawest of the African tribes, who are draughted into these corps on their release from the holds of the captured slave ships, and who have merely an appearance of civilization given to them by the profession of Christianity and the adoption of the European dress and drilL Another serious question is the effect which the introduction of this new element would be likely to have upon India. The Bengal Sepoy army has revolted, but the native armies of Madras rand Bombay remain firm, and the general population is still on our side. These are invaluable advan'cages, which ought not to be risked even for an undoubted accession of military strength. If the people of India were to declare against us, our Negro and Caifre levies would be of small help to us. The people of India have an ancient civilization and a religious and social system to which they are zealously attached, and which are regarded by them as their " civil and religious liberties," as we regard the inestimable privileges for whici our ancestors fought and died. We need noconsult history, although it is ful of instruction on the subject, for what has lately taken place ia India demonstrates the intensity which the religious feeling communicates to whatever it touches. Le; those who bes3t know the people of India say whether their susceptibilities would not be alarmed oy the sudden introduction of a barbarian soldiery of strange and uncouth visage and unknowntongue, whose nominal Christianity would be certain to be disgraced byignorant collisionwiththemostcherished native habits. The novelty and the extraordinary nature of the expedient would give a dangerous handletoour enemies, and it would be justly accepted as a proof of our having lost all confidence in the natives of India, and of our having resolved in consequence to transfer the natural advantages of their eountry to races who are even more foreign to them than we are ourselves, and are not recommended, as we are, by superior civilization and intelligence. If, after we have repaired our military errors by increasing the European element in our army, by mixing the native element and making it entirely subsidiary to the European force, by keeping the strongholds (which should be constructed at every principal station), magazines, and artillery entirely in our own hands, by establishing a semi-military police for the performance ef the civil duties heretofore intrusted to the Sepoys, and by giving to military officers the usual professional motives for taking an interest in their regimental duties, trustworthy material ihould not be forthcoming In the Punjab and the l'pper Provinces, to say nothing of the Madras and b-,mbay Presidencies, it will be time enough to look to the Eastern and Western Coasts of Africa as a resource.

The train which left Chestnut-hill at 15 minutes past 7 o'clock was passing along near the spot described when a girl, apparently about 19 years of age, was observed walking upon the track towards the city, a short distanoe ahead of the train. The engineer blew his whistle, but the girl, instead of getting out of the road, kept on her way, merely turning round and looking at the approaching engine. When too late to atop the train, and when the engine was within a short distance of her, she covered her eyes with her hands and threw herself across the rail. The train came thundering on, passng ove- "er body, teazing every shred ot clotbing from It, and sev..ng the trunk almost in two. The back part of her head was also torn off. The train was stopped as soon as possdble, and the remains of the deceased were gathered together by tbe roadside.

T1EB MUTINIES IN INDIA. From the number of letters forwarded to us by the relatives or friends of officers serving in India we extract the following:- THE BATTLE OF ACGR. Extat of a letter written by a lady, dated from the Fort at Agra, July 16. We were wamed of the approach of the Neemuch force some days before they came. On their arrival at)Futtehore Sicrl (22 niles from Agr) the ladies were sent into the fort, and on Sunday, the 5th of July, a battle was fought at Shabgunge (a villae close by the Lieutenant-Govemor's house, and three miles from the cantonments and four from the fort) by 400 of our Europeans, one battery of artillery, and 18 of the volunteer horse, against more than 3,000. Imagine the enemy's cavalry consisted of 1,200 and ours but 18, 5 of whom wren killed. I did not know A- wa there. I thought and was assured he was with a party Of the volunteers gArdiog the intrenchments near the fort; and not till he had been back a long time, and I had regained my composure, did he tell me he had bee in the thick of the fight, anda howed rne bis wound, which was a sight sword cut on his thumb. Mr. Oldfield wa severely wounded, bhu is now much better. (The report that he waa among the killed will, I trust, turn out to be inoorrect, as this letter was writtea 11 days after the engagement.) The fight Â¢ommenÂ¢ed ata-quarter to 3 p.m .and lasted ti 6. The firitg WAS kept UP staily those three hours. We could only distinguish the line of smoke, but the firing was fearfuly distinct. I trust I way never pass such a day again. Tha quick, close, sharp firing of the musketry was far worse even than the loud peal, of the gunsm Our force nade an orderly retreat into the fort, as they were short of ammunition, not knowing that the enemy Were also short and were fleeing. We did not know for two days that we had gained a victory, wvhen we hoard that the rautineershad fled to Muttra The Europeans (soldiers) went out of the fort, and the demonstration made by them did an immense deal of good, restosed order and confidence in the town, but was made too late to save the staion, which was burat and plundered during the two days all the Europens were shut up in the fort.

" We are here now, like rats in a trap; there are at least 4,000 or 5,000 people in this fort, mixed, of course, military cd civil, Eurasns, half-cst, ., and when we shall get out is a thing to be guessed at, " In my last letter, written from Mudrak (ti letter has failed), I told you what I had been about. We held our position on the road to Allygurh until the 3d of July, whxen a regiment of cavalry belonging to the Gwalior Contingent and a battery of guns mutinled; they were between our little band and Agra. Captin Borlton poor fellow, sinoo dead of cholera, gave us information; our only hope was to get into Agra, a distance of 46 miles, but we were obliged to leave the road and make our way acro(s country. We started at 2 am. on the morning of the 3d and after a ride of 50 miles arrived at Kundowlie, 10 miles from Agra. We halted there for a feir hours and then came into Agra; people there rather alarmed, but, as we supposed, everything quiet. At thSat time the Kotah Contingent, 700 [men in all, cavalry, infaniry, and a battery of six guns, were in Agra and were considered stanch. About half-past 5 in the afternoon we heard a tumult and guns firin close. I went out to learn the cause, and wu told by an offioer who was passing that the Rotah Contingent had mutinied and gone off to the insurgents. Agra was thus left clear of any native regiments, and left with one infantry regement, the 3d Europeans, and one European battery of guns; people were of course alarmed, but still thought the feUows were gorne off clear, who5n the intelligence came that a large force was moving on Agra. On the morning of the 5th of July the new's was confirmed; they were only some five miles away when it was determined (wisely or not is a question not to be mooted now) to go out and meet them. The old leaven roee within me, and I accompanied them. Our force con. shted of about 650 European Infantry and one battery of guns, the infantry commanded by Colonel Riddell, and the artillery by the gallant Captain D'Oyly; their force consisted of 4,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 11 gunsfrightful odds. I must also add that we had on our slde may mounted volunteers, gentlemen of the civil service, civilians of the station, and the officers of the 44th and 67th Regiments of Native Infantry, regiments that have been disbanded, andtheirarmstakenaway. Weleft theparade about 11 in the morning, and had not proceeded more than two miles when we heard of the enemy. We atrived on an open plain, and found the enemy in position behind a village, their guns flanking the village, their cavalry again flanklng the guns; our little force formed a line with three guns on each flank, those on the right flank commanded by Captain D'Oyly and the left by Captain Pearson. We advanced thu within half-a-mile of them, when they opened the ball with a round shot from their left battery ; our one regiment, the 3d Europeans, got the order to lie down, the guns unlimbered, and then the fight oommenced in earnest. From my own experience I can say nothing, but from that of others it was a hard fight of artiUery for rt least two hours, when one of the tambrils of the left battery (ours) blew up; the fiends attemptedc a cheer, which dissolved itself into a yelL One of our guns was thus disabled. They threatened ns then with a charge of cavalry, but they were immediately stopped by a rattling voUey from the 3d Europeans. After a little more artillery practice the line got the word 'Ad. vance,' and gallantly they did it, under a heavy fire of artillery and] infantry, the mutinied 72d Regiment of Native Infantry having their rifle company in the village picking our poor fellows off; but they paid dearly for it afterwards; a rush was made on the village, and it was carried and surrounded. We were stll to be unfortunate, for another tumbril in the left battery was blown up; we therefore had onlyfour guns, and, strange to say, no ammunition, for the artillery, by some-what shall I say? mistake, oversight-well, never mind whatno spare ammunition had been brought out. Thus we had carried the village, driven them from their position, and tben no ammunition ! Of course, immediately they found their artillery was not answered they knew there was something wrong with us, and advanced upon their old position. We had to retire under a heavy fire, and threatened on each side by their cavalry; but the felows had not the pluck to attackus even then ; they made several attempts, but a volley always sent them to the right-about. We, however, arrived safely at the fort, and immediately afterwards the work of destruction commenced. The budmashes (Indian thieves) immediately began to plunder. Bungalows on every side were set on fire; one continual blaze the whole night. I went out the next morning; 'twas a dreadful sight indeed; Agra was destroyed-churches, colleges, dwellinghouses, barracks, everything burnt. I lost everything I posseLaed in the world; but we are all in the same boat. alhe enemy were satisfied with their lickingand wentquietly off; and here we are, we can't go out-no place to go tonothing to do but to wait for asistance, which I do tru t we shall receive soon. I am sorry to say our casualties were heavy. The ArtiUlery had one officer, Captain D'Oyly, ,'ounded, a gallant fellow, since dead, four men killed, 16 wounded. 3d Europeaus.-38 men kielld, 62 wounded 3olicerbwounded. CivilLinesMounted Miltia.-5gentlemen killed, 1 officer and S gentlemen wounded. Civil Lines Militialnfantry.-1 gentleman killed, 5 wounded; unattached officers, 5 wounded.

'bis is a true account of the battle of Shahgange, and I thar k God I escaped, although two or three times very nanrowly. WeU, I trust we shall yet have our day." The following is from a medical officer lately attached to the Gwalior Contingent:- F Fort Agra, July 16. "The whole of the C-Gsalior Contingent in Gwalior -viz., two regiments of infantry and two bast& lions of artillery, mutinied on the 9th of June, when seven officers, one ldy (a sweet pretty creatur, the wife of (ne of the efficers of artillery), and three little children were murdered by the Sepoys. In spite of all our efforts the spirit of disaffection spread to my regiment (the 2d Cavalry, Gwalior Contingent), and the most extraordinay feature in the affair was, that instead of the native officers or men (in number 200) taldng advantage of our 6olitary position (43 miles away from any chanoe of assistance)-we being three officers, Burlton commanding, Sal. mond the Adjutant, and mysef-they quietly told us we must go, and that they would offer us no violenoe wh&tever. The same was the case with the 1st Cavalry, forming a stranl,o contrast to the infantry corps, many of the officers of whicb, from being unble to escape, were murdered, and those who did eape did so with the greatet diffioulty. "My eorps mutied on th 2d of JT*, and u.got into Aga on the morning of th 3sa On the next evening the Ketch Contingent muftnld, A I want out witi the 3d Bengal Zuropesa Fuale and a Europeua baUery of six gu to the spot where tbh lad been emceanped, when we espturedtheir two guns and brought them nuto cantonIments. " On the morning of the 5th (Sunday) inkelligenxe caue that a strong body of mutineerg, consisting of cavslry, infantry, and 11 guns (artillery), about 5,000, hsd intrenuched themselves in a village about four miles off Our po.r forc of about 500 regular Eurepean oldiers 200milltia, and a battery of six guns, was sent out against them. Thig was the first time I had been in action under fire, and old offioers who had been al through the Punjab campaigns decired it was the hottest work they had seen at al. The eona roud shot from the enemy came within 30 ywar of where I was on horseback, and strak a tree cloge bedae me. The battle of Shahgunge lasted about two hours; we sgnceedsd in taking the village, but havig run short of ammunition (not another zhot being left to fire from the gpns) we retired into cantonments, and then into the fort of Agr Our logs was 49 killed and 91 wounded-very haavy indeed, one in three. " It was considered prudent our thus going out to give battle to the insurgents, instead of waiting to be attaked and appearing afraid of them, and it wAs made evident that th -had received severe punishment-and thought themselves Vall beaten, as they went off in another drection. "' -e were obliged to come into the fort immediatdy afer the action, as the instant our backs were turned to go out to give battle to the rebel force at Shahgunge the vilains in the city of Agra set fire to nearly every bungal0o, bamck, and church in the place, and it would be difficult to give you a correct description of the scene which presented itself at night, the whole place being in a blaze, more nearly resembling a scene in the ProphUc than anything I Can thiuk of. The whole seems a wrr of extermination of all Europeans in India, and a blessed thing it will be when European regiments come out to asdst u The scene in the fort for the first few days wa a ting one. Alltheservantsranoff; IhadUinthemo-ning,sad at night not one. Ladies were seen oowldngtheir own food, oflicers dwawing nd carrying water from the wells, &c. 3any people are ruined, hainig escped with only the clothes on their backs. I am one of the less unfortunate, having lost about 4,000 rupees. We are now shut-up here, 500 fighting men with ammunition, and about 4,000 or 5,000 altogether, eagerly awating the arrival of European troops. ey only prayer now is, thzt God may protect you all and be pleased to spare me to wee you once again, when I Could be Content to die in peac" The following is from an officer belonging to the cavalry of the Gwalior contingent: "Fort Agra, July 15. "Here we are shut up in the fort last, and when weare to get out is problematical. Sinoe I last wrote a good many thiags have occurred not so satisfactory as one might have wiShed, but I have no time for particulas. Poor Burlton died of cholera two days ago. I have been wounded thre3 tle-onc- la the lft wrsBt by a spent ball, once in the right side (slightlY) by A spear thrust, and once in tho left arm by a sword cut through the extnsor musles Our regiuent (2d Cavalry, Gwalior Contingent), with the - Cavlry and Pearon's battery, mutinied at Sa&,e oft the 2d inst., 37 miles from here. It ws touch-and-go work, but they finally let us go unharmed, and we rode straight in here, arriving at 6 a.m. on the 3d The same evening the Eotah Contingent revolted, shot their sergeant, tried to shoot their officers and joined the Neemuch force coming to attack us. I went after them, as aide-de-carnp to Colonel Riddell, commanding 3d Europeans, aud brought back six guns. " Next day the enemy had advanced to witbin three miles of us, and 60 of the 3d and D'Oyly's batterywent out, I with them. They were very strongly posted at a village. We came within 500 yards, and then the infantry were ordered to lie down, and our guns, three on each flank, opened, This continued for three hours, during which their cavalry (we had none but a few volunteers) came at us several times and once charged through us from the rear, very nearly 'boning' me. As I was on a gray mar, I presume I attracted notice. You never heard such firing; the shrpnell shells, round shot, and grape, to say nothing of hundreds of msusket balls, were flying about our ears as thick as haiL I wa, with our left battery when they blew up two of our tumbrils and dismounted one of our three guns. What a cheer they gave ! Then from behind the village out dashed a party of cavlry. Up jumped a company of the 3d and gave them a volley, Which emptied hal their saddles, and sent them to the right about. At length the order was given to assault thO village iu two columns. I went with the left one. Lord, what a peppering we got! I don'tknow how on earth so few were killed. Well, we drove them from the village and spiked a eun. I saw this was the time, and galloped back to tell the Brigadier they were flying in confusio. He ordered ne instantly to bring up the guns. I went, but alas ! not a round of ammunition remained "I certainly thought that we were done, and that not a manwould reach Agra alive. Of course we retreated at once, they walking lnto us with a six-pounder as we went. Thomas, the major of tho 3d, w shot at the village. Poor lYOQly was mortally wounded; many others were done for. Altogether, we lost 1 man in 6. "We passed straightthrough the cautonments into the fort. Soon all the splendid barracks and house were in a flame, but we were left unmolested All the women and children are safe in the fort. "I am now a commisrt officer, and precous hard work I have of it. " This is a war of extermination. Trhe Mahomedan have made tools of the Eindoos, and now are showing in their true colours. Their hope is not to leave a sIngle Christian alive. Please goodness, they'll be sold yet ! They'l have no merqy from me. pve already fairly killed with my sword between 25 and 30 of them, beides having cut down a good many more. My only wound of Consequence is a sword cut in ths left arm, which I received when storming a village on foot. The fellow fought well, but I at length killed him with a blow which nearly cut his head in two. This vwas on the 1st inst., just before our regiment muticied. I was very savage that day. Just as I had done with the chap I wounded I had a turn up with four more. They knocked over the only Sowar who was with me with a sort of battle-axe. I had one pistol with me, with which I blew the head of one of them to pieces, and then turned and ran; but my foot slipped, and down I came. Luckily, I was up again before they could polish me off; bat I felt too done to ran any more, so turnedon them and wounded two in a moment. To my intense dellgbt they then ran off, bat were met by some Sowers hunting for me, and all killed. "India has to be reconquered. There is uo denying that we have lost it. All at Cawnpore have beea killed after a gallant fight. Perhaps the same will happen here. If the mutineers bring up the siege train from Gwallor we are done. But if they are unable to oro,s the Chumbul we shall, I hope, be able to bold oat tiU reinforcements arrive." THE SIEGE OF DELHI. The following is from an officer of Engineers, dated " Camp before Delli, Monday, June 22" - " My last letter was written about a week ago, and in it I gave you an account of the events which had happened up to our arrival here; since then, I am sorry to say, we have made very little progress. We have now been here a fortnight, and, as far as I see, are no nearer ta}dng Delhi than we were the day of our arrivaL We are sadly in want of a ' head ;' there are committees and councils, and all sorts of absard plans started every day, but nothing ever comes of them; at present they say that they are waiting for reinforcements before going ia. Colonel Baird Smith has been written for to take the direotion of the engineer ing operations, and, asthere is no doubt he is a good practical man, we are looking forward to his arrival as the beginning of a better state of affairs. We have noy; got five bstteries, mounting about 15 guns and mortars on the ridge, from which we fire into Delhi, they returnin,g the compli. mient, but comparatively there is little harm done on either _ At A - -- -- I 1 side, as we are 1,500 yards, or nearly a mile, distant from them. They also comue out nearly every day, and attack us in force, but are always driven back with loss; this sate of affairs, however, is vary harassing for our men this hot weather, and we lose several men and two or three officers, killed and wounded, almost every day. Last Wednesday afternoon, the 17th inst., two columns of our force went out to dislodge the enemy from a strong position they haa tak-en up on our right, where, aiso, they were constructing a battery to enfilade our position on the ridge, aLd which, therefore, it was important should be destroyed. I was in charge of a small party of Sappers, who went in front of one of these columns to remove obstacles and destroy the enemy's battery. AU our operations were successful, as we dislodged the villains and destroyed their works lilling about 50 of them; our loss was about 10 wound6d' Enclosed is an extract from, the Field Foroe orders, from which you wiU see thatI was fortunate enough to mest -ith Major Reid's approvaL "June 26.-Things aregoirgon prettymuch the same since I last wrote. On Mionday evening last a party of Sappers under Lieutenant Maunseil and myself, went out to demolish a couple of bridges over the canal, about three milea from tbis, over which the enemy were in the habit of taking their artilleryand foroes when they wished to attack us in the rear; wewere accompanied by a party of 100 infantry and 50 cavalr of the Guides (a fiue set of fellows, meet of them Slkhs from the ?unjab, and capital folrows to fight) F left e p about 6 p.m. and got to the bridges about duk, witbout 6g any adrentures except the captureofa fewviagse By 9.30 we had got the muines in the nearest bddge ready for firing, abd were hard at work on the further one, when the sentres came in to report thata large body of men we advancing on us from Delhi, and distant about 200 yards We had almoBt got the mines ready, and I wa juAt lowedng tl.e las powder barrel into itpLace, whe a peadeaeoa to strik the whole of thentrias, and hone and foot, sbhet 20 ia number, ene pourixg acrm the bridge and aloct knocking the working p4rty over, at the san time friug hbrd at the supposed enemy.

"This day (Tauesy, June 28) wa one of the hardt days fighting we have h Oar nen were turned out at 3 ia the morning wit'hout bredakt, and eontinued fighting the whole day till dusk, without any food, in a blazing sun. So you may fanc how tebly done they were. Some of them had jtm arrived from a 22-mile march, sAd wTer turned out half an hour after their arrivAl in camp. The enemy had established themelves in a village on the right of our position, in which they ha posted two heavy guns, wbich raked our batteris and threw skot and shcll into the camp, Our men chared through and through thi village (or town, rather, as it wa compose abnost entirely of strong stone house and snlese); but the blackguard had shutthemaelves so strongly in that our men could mot force the doors, ad It was not till evening that they wer all turned out. Our loes w about 100 killed azd wounded; theirs I said to have been 1,000-50D I fany is nearer the mark The greet want in thi, s in all our actions, ws the want of a heaid; offioers lead on their parties without any method or arrangementS; ew geat mistake was their now Sending on Sapper with the attaching force, A, if they had, we should have bem able to burst in the doors, and so enable the troops to get at the niggers. Many of our me wre so done that the sank down on the road, even under fire, dead beat and went off to sleep. There wre alo sweral cases of sun-stroke. Since then we have benleft pretty quiet; to-day we head they were coming out again, and Tnlford and myself have been in readiness all day witl two parties of Sapper:s pro. vided with battering-rams, crowbars &c., for demolishing, to accompany the troops, but they have not troubled us as yet. Our batteries on the ridge and teis continue to ire away at one another. I am generally up for eight hours out of the 24, repairing batteries, building new ones, c We have lost in the Sappers sbout 20 killed and wounded; luckily no offis smong the former; two orthreeareslightly wounded. " We re expecting tho rains now every day. We are famonsly off, having a good house over our heads (one of the deserted bungalows), Almot everybody else, except the wounded, are under canvass. Everybody is looking forward to the arrival of reinforcementg and Generl Grant, who is reported to have left 3MiAs on the 18th instant; tMi then, I fancy, we shall stay on here as we ae. I am thankful to say I am in capital health, and have been mercifully spared hitherto, although having had several shaves. The heat has been and is grenat, but somehow, when you have something to do, you don't notice it." The following letter is from Major Alexander H. Cobbe,87th R.l.F., serving at Delhi usvolunteer:- " Camp before Delhi, July 13. You will be glad to hear that I amw w ; indeed, I never felt better inmy ife, though the clime i somewhat tring in tents at this aeuon. The rains have commenced, and it Is no longer hot, but for my part I proferred the dry heat of June (themometer in tent, 106') to this damp westher. Your letter of the 18th April is the last that hs reached me, so I fear All later ones are lost. Our communication now is vridLaore, Mooltan, and Bombay, and not through Agra, s formerly, the roads below Delbi being no longer open or safe. We are til 's itting' before this city, and I do not kow what the plans of the campaign are,-whether we arc to wait for reinforcemnents expected up from the south, or to sttack the plae and take it by asult. The latter ought to have been adopted some days go, but I think the former plan is the one that will be pursued; and if the European troops which are sid to be mrching up are nea undoubt. edly it will be the wiser plan. Not one Hindestanee Sepoy can be trusted. The Sikhs and Ghoorkas (hill men, chiefly from Nepaul), as well as the Punjabee Irregular troops, ar the only natives we can trast, and they are fighting right manfully by our side; but they are not numerous, and oar European soldiers are not many, as our force is the 'IReserve Army of India.' We awe, however, well off in field artillery about 34 or 36 field-guns, manned by Europeans, also a good number of Foot Artillerymen, consisting of both Europeans and SikBs. Our infantry consits of about 3,800 men, 2,400 of whom are European4s the rest natives of the class above mentioned. There have been a great manv skirmishes since I Ilst wrote-indeed, the average is about two or th-ee a-week. The Sepoys are great hands at concealing themselves wnell uder cover, bat if you catch them on the opea ground they ar gret cowards. " The sharpest fight we have yet had was on the 23d of June. ThiE was the 10h aiversary of the Battle of Plas6ey, and the day predioted for the. termination of our rule in India. They fought from half-past 5 a.m. til hal&fpas 6 p.m., and lost a great hany men, 700 or 800 at let. On our side there were about 150 killed and wounded-more than we can spae. There wa another sharp sldrmish on the 27th, another on the 4th inst., and again on the 9th, on which last occasion the mutineers were well punished. They had made themslves quita drunk with a native drug called 'bhang,' and conse quently were more courageous than usul, and charged our men two And three times at one of our batteries.A small party of the 60th Rifles killed in one spot 50 men, and 60 men of the G-aides Corps kIlled 80 in another. Altogether they must aave lost that day about 60 men. We have been quiet since, but are on the look-out daily for another attack. Their custom is whein a party of mutineers from another station come to join their Delhi brethren to make them go out and fight before they admit them into the dty. Those who once fight do not like to do so a second time. They are, however, very numerous within Delhi-about 12,000 men. Long before this I hoped to have told you of the fall of Delhi. We must have patienLe, however. We have losta great many menand offioers since the conmmencement of the outbreak on the 10th of May bysick. nes and by the enemy, to say nothing of the barbarous massacre of helpless men, women, and children in isolated stations. I am most anxious about F- and A-, for the 1st Cavaly, a portion of which is u. Mhow, has mutinied in another station and may possibly have done the same at Idhow. God protect them both! Every mail that goes home must bear sorrow to many a heart. For such risks soldiers take servioe; but the horrible part is the murder of women and children. India will be no plnce for women for the next two or three yers. I may be wrong. but I fancy the present campaign will not be conluded till March or ApriL If we get over the hot wtather all right it will be pleasant enongh moving about after these Sepoys, but at present the climate is trying, and after a day spent on duty one feels quite knocked Up, but, as I said before, I never felt better. I hope the Government will notdelay in sending us out troops; 30,000 ought to be sent out, and as many as possible through Egypt by the overland route. The whole of Indi& is ina critical state. Troops from Malta and Gibraltar might be pushed on. " July 15. " I could not finish this on the 13th, and all yesterday there was fighting going on, so l culd not write.

Is It not wonderful that not one out of the whole Indian army (men whom we hAve treated, God knows, far better than they deserve) was faithful? They made a deliberate conspiracy to kill their officers, and actually did so at Delhi, the account of which you Vll have heard. We were saved here by a miracle.

VANDALISV 12? SCOTLA ND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Visiting this romantic locality, I was alike surprised and grieved to observe workaen employed in taking down the old bridge, which has withstood the effects of time and floods for a period of not less than 1,200 (some say 1,400) 7ears. On inquiring as to tbe cause of Po extraordinary a piece of Vandalism, I was informed thab Sir Thomas Monctieff, the proprietor wau about to build a stable or shed in the neighbourho; and that for this purpose the old bridge furnished a convenient quarry. Thi5 I have asoei. tained to be the only resaun. Thus is this fine old ruin, one of the finet of the period to which It belongs which can be found in the country, being sacrificed for the poor money worth of its old stones;and, as I have watched with sad interest the progress of the Jabours of the men who are Vandals against their will, I should say that both stones and men conspire to resist so unhallowved a work. I trust that the insertion of this letter in Te Times maw even yet prevent the complete accomplishment of the worC; of demolition by inducing Sir Thomas to reoonsider his purpose- I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

AN AmERICAN ViEw OF TRE DrvoRCE BiLL.-The object of the Bill is to extend to the English middle classes the same privileges on the subjec of divorce vwhich have for two centuries past been enjoyed by the rich ; to put it in the power of any }glish sb t to obtain, by the expenditure of two or three hundred dollars, a boon the enjoyment of which has hitherto been limited to 'hose who could afford to spend ten thousand dollars-that being about the lowest amout needed to carrq through a divorce under the system which now exists. This proposal, however, is very shocking to quite a number of members of Parliament, who, if they have not actully voted for special divorcea, have at Ieat suffered them to pss without protest. Thoy discover all at once th by religion and law marria e is indissoluble under any circumntances, and that the same Privilege on this subject enjoyed by the few cannot be extended to the many without danger of an utter dissolution of manners. The EnglLsh clergy, always the bul. 'ark of the aristocracy, from which all its higher members were selected, ste forward with zeal in the support of exist. iug privileges. !they undertake to make a matter of conscience of it So long as the divorced parties were persons of wealth and position the clergy seem to have married them again without protest or question; but tho idea of giving the marriage benediction to mere vulgar culprits greatly troubles them, and has led to many petitions against the new Bill, to which the English clergyseews about as gene. rly oppoed as they re to allowing a man to marry the ser oif his decesed wife. Whether the English law which admits the remarriage of the guilty party to a divoroa is wise or not is a questien upon which we express no opt. nion. In most Protestaut countries such marrnsas are pro. 1-bited, though here, in the United States, the prohibition is constantly evaded by celebrating the new marriage in a different State from that in which the divorce was obtained. The poix that strikes us as odd Is, that only in this particular cads do the clergy charge their consciences witfh the proprnety or moraity of the marriages they are called upon toceleiate. The same principle, fully and consistently carried out, would, we apprehend, stop a great many mar- ges, A. clergyman called upon to celebrate a.marre is boundto satisfy himself that no legal obtacle exists. But it woul4 zot seem necessary to ask any questions for mere e onstncc aake,-2Y'cw York Tribene.

This buildiug at prmsent consists of one centre span 82 feet wlieby 261 feet-long, and 94 feet high to the ridge. It also contains two -eide spans, each 32 feet wide by 232 feet long, It is, moreover, in contemplation to extend the roof -on addition of 5S feet, so as to adapt it for building the largest class of men-of-war. The edifice is provided with three travelling cranes, which traverse the entire length, 'the two intended for operation in side bays being' each -capable of lif ting 7 tons, and the centre one 20 tons. The weight of the latter, when loaded, amounts to 6S tons, and st is workfed at a height of 70 feet above the slip, thu3 leaving abundant head-room for the construction of any ,class of ship below it.

THE ROYAL SURREY GARDMEIS. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In reply to the letter of Mr. Holmes in your paper of this date I have simply to state that 2,0001. out of the 2,5481. 15s. Gd. alleged to have been paid to me on account of my salary is represented by shares in the Royal Surrey Gardens. Their present value no one is more capable of estimating than Mr. Holmes himself. Independently of these shares, 1,5001. is still due to me for salary, in respect of wbich I have received nothing whatever but a dishonoured bill for 5001. There is also due 3931. 15s. 2d. for the band, and nothing has been paid towards this save a dishonoured check for 2501., signed "Thomas K, Holmes, George Bain, and James Coppock." hMr. Holmes has estimated these " securities" as money. He will doubtless accept my offer to sell them to him at a handsome discount. I may add that, in consequence of my remaining here to fulfil duties for which I have never baen paid, I was conupelled to decline the offer of engagements to the amount of upwards of 2,0001. I remain. Sir. vonrs obedientlv. JULLEENI. Au.g. 31. TO THE EDITOR OF TEiE TIMES. Sir,--In yoaur columns of this day I am accused by Mr. Coppock of filing an affidavit without reading it in open court; and that such affidavit is " substantially untrue." I am therefore sure you will allow me a short space to answer such portion of his letter through your paper, and other parts, such as the correspondence he alludes to, we will diseuss before the shareholders when he pleases. It is true that my affidavit was not read in coart, for the simple reason that the Commissioner had resolved to postpone the petition, on the application of Mr. Fleaming, before it came to my turn to address the Court, and I then said that, "observing his Hononr's inclination to adjourn the consideration of the petition, I had no wish to press the extraordinary facts contained in my affidavit upon the Court, or to creato worse ill-feeling than, unfortunately, existed ;" and this alone, together with the excessive heat of the court, made me think it unnecessary to read my affidavit; but I state positively that a copy of my affidavit was sent fully two hours before the sitting of the Court to Mr. Jones, the soli,;itor to the company, and, eonsequently, of Mr. Coppock and the petitioner, and although the time was short, it was the earlickt at which it could be copied by a stationer. With regard to its being " substantiallv untrue." aud that Mr. Coppock will prove it "a tissae of garbled sratements" and contradict all its " material averiuents" is a question for the shareholders to decide; but, as this may take a long time to do, and the proper time may never arrive. I beg to rueuind the shareholders that the following are the chief stateuments in my affidavit, and hereafter they will have to decide upon themL either as "truth" or "garbled statements:- 1. i asserted in my affidavit that Mr. Tyler could not make his zoological undertaking pay, and that he tried to dispose of the gardens, hut could not. 2. 'I'hat the Limited Liability Act coming into operation it was put forth as a public comlpany limited, in which Mr. Coppock was one of the registered promoters, although he states in his letter that he joined it reluctantly. 3. That under this companv the lease and premises (the wild beasts and other moveables having been previously sold by auction, were assigned to the comupany at 14,0001., though this or any other sum was not mentioned in the prospectus under which the conmpany was formed. 4. That to render the ground available and attractive 25,0001. waS laii olit, in addition to the 14,0001. to be given MIr. Tyler, which these centlemen divided between them, Mr. Coppock taking 11,001. as his share, and they kindly condescended to take this 141,0001. as paid-up sha:es. 5. That at the second nmeeting the shareholders were kept in the largo hall, and then shown into an adjoining room with the sandwiches and wine spread, and accounts at one end in a bundle for any one to take who happened to see them, aiid that Mr. Coppock and other directors voted for tbe ppassing of sueh account, and that in such account the mortgages, amounting to 14,500Z., and debts, about 9,0001., ,were oxmiitted (by mistake, no doubt !), and that 5,0801. was asserteud to ke the only debts due, except current exspenses; and that althoegh 1,16l11. is stated to be in hand and at the bankers at the enc of December la,t, 4771., or thereabouts, is all that was mt the bankers' at the end of the year, and I could not tell iato whose hand or pocket the balance went. 6. That I called a public n. -'g, ard laid the above. mentioned facts before the shareholders and asked for a " comnittee of iniluiry," but that the shareholders thought such inquiry unnecessary, because M'r. Coppock stated that offrens absut tba t a mie atmounts had baen made by other parties. bitt whi0i I found afterwards wc re fallacious. 7. That, after, tbis advertisements appeared in T1e Times paper for raising msore capital upon the strength of the 10 per cent. dtviti,iid, aid they went on building uuder a contract for 2,5001'., when at the end of March last they had not 101. at their bankers', and at the end of April less than 101., notwithbtanding the advertisement referred to; but that afterwards between 1,0001. and 2,0001. as raissed by such advertisement, which I consider fraudulent. These, I believe, are my chief avermeonts; and by the full truth of thenm I stand or fall. But now let me ask why is Mlr. Coppock so eager that this company should be immediately wound up ? If wound up, there will be no miyne for inquiring into this 14,0001., and the oppsrtiinitv will be lost for looking into his trans. actions under the deed of settlerment,where it will be found, among otb,er tLivgs, that the directors had only power to borro-,v lO.tt)01. upon mortgage, but that they have borrowed 14,5.i01. asid bave accepted lots of bills of exohauge without power to do so, all of which they have done without the sanction or even the knowledge of the shareholdes-s. Bat there is this g<ood reason why it should not be wvound up-nanmely, that, Mr. Coppock and Mr. Tyler will be made to disgorge a large miroportion of their 14,0001., and in this way the boni tide capital of the company may be brought down to a fair and just amuount-and thus the creditors may very soon get a. dividend upon their debts, and the shareholders ultimately something for their sbares ; hi, if woiund up in the way wished by Mr. Coppock, neither recditors nor sharebolders can ever get a farthiDig, but it willallow Mr. Coppock and his friends (echo a,iswers Coppo.k !) to comiie in anid reooesas the property, the poor creditors and shareholders being left, like eats in a garret, to stare at each other.

RAILWAY IWAErIGENCE, NORTR.WRESTERN. The halfÂ£yeatly mceting of this compkny was held at. Morecambe on Friday. The Secretary read the report, from which it appeared that the gross receipts from traffic, &c., for the half-year had been 23,1491., being MI60. iD excess of the amount received for the corresponding period of the year 18B56. The expenses amounted to 12,7701., leaving a balance of 10,3791. The chbrges for interest on debenture debt, preference ahares, uncompleted land purchases, bank balances, and a halfyear's income-tax, amounted to 9,7131, being an increase of 5661. upon similar charges for the corresponding period of the previous year. After payment of all preference charges there remained a balance of 7061., which the directors recommended should be carried to the next half. year's account. The sum of 1,029. had been paid on account of the expenses of the recent applicationto Parliament, vhen they were defeated by the Lancaster and Carlisle Company i and the directors congratulated the shareholders that-the object they sought would be secured to the public without the necessity of their pledging their present under. taking for the large additional capital which would have had to be raised, inasmuch as their line would now forma a connecting link of the shorte4st route between London and Scotland. The directors concluded by expressing a hope that the Castle Douglas and Portpatrick and the Lancaster and Ulverstone Railways would prove of considerable ad. vantage to the.company by improving the traffic upon their railway. The CHAR?wAy , after explaining tbe proceedings in Parliament dring the past session with reference to the Tebay and logleton branch, moved tho adoption of the report, which was seconded by leEr. Haxx!, and carried. There was no dividend declared, and after some discus. sion. the proceedings terminated. MID-KENT (BROMLEY TO ST. MARY CRAY). The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the office, South Sea-house, Mr. W. Dent in the chair. Mr. G. Woolcott, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the accounts of the half-year ending June 30th show a balance of 7,1111., and, besides that, 5,250l deposited with the Court of Chancery. The expenditar oi capital account amounted to 7,3611., of which 2,4511. is for! land and compensation. The project of the South-Eastern, (Greenwich Junction to Dartford) Railway, so suddenly and unexpectedly brought before ParLiament in the last session, became at once on the part of the directors an object of the most anxious and earnest consideration. After mature deliberation they arrived at the conolusion that the effbct of this so-called "relief line" would be to absorb a large portion of the traffic upon which this company had calculated for a profitable return in the employment of its capital. The directors therefore resolved, ia conjunction with the East Kent Company, to give to that project their most determined opposition, and the result was that the Bill, which passed a committee of the House of Commons, was rejected by a committee of the House of Lords. The directors trust that a powerful body like the South-Eastern Company will, as regards this company, henceforth recognize and act upon the principle enunciated in the reporb of the committee of the House of Commons on Railway and Canal Bills, 1853-a principle which the SouthEastern Company sought to enforce against the East Kent Company during the late Parlianentary contest-namely, fThat companies having been authorized by the Legislature to construct expensive works for public use, the resourcs from which their just remuneration was to spring should not be taken anay upon any other than clear grounds of Plablcpqlicy." The directors are stil of opinion that the zast Kent project of a line from Strood to St. Mary Cray, combining a West-end terminus with the required relief to the whole of the present overcrowded North Kent line, is a measure of public necessity, and would afford the most convenient, least expensive, and shortest roate from the metropolistoCanterb iry, Dover, andthecontinent. Anasgreercen; nas been entered into with the West-end and Crystal Palace Rallway Company for the passage of engines and carriages over the portion of the line of that company between Shortlands and Beckenham. The works are in a satisfactory state of progress, and the directors will further cause them to be strenuously prosecated, with a view to the speedy oompletion of the undertaking. The report of Mr. Fowler, the engineer, stated that he was now urging forward the works between Shortlands and Southborough-ro,.d as rapidly as possible. The works of the West end and Crystal Palace (Farnborough extension) would be certainly ready for public traffic early in the ensuing spring. He hoped, in consequence of the lighter character of the works on their line, to bave it ready for opening simultaneously with the Norwood and Bromley (West-end) line.k The CiAIIRMItN, in moving the adoption of the re ,rt said it was so full that it required no explanatjon from hm He understood that the chairman of the South-Eastern Company had stated that it was their intention to bring forward a comprehensive scheme which thby believed would satisfy all the demands of Mid Kent. He hoped it might be so, for any project that should supply the Mid Kent and East Kent district must comprehend a communication from Beckenbam to Maidstone and other parts of East Kent, and if such a scheme did not comprehend the places requiring railway accommodation it would not be satisfactory. He felt convinced that the extension of the Cray's line to Strood would be made some day, and the only question was who should make it. Captain HANKEY seconded the motioa for the adoption of the report, and it was carried. On the motion of Mr. L.Si-drsoN, a resolution waspassed authorizing the directors to exercise the bchrro wing po?wers of the company to the extent of 23,0O01. A vote of thanks to the ohairman and directors concluded the proceedings. THA-MES HAVEN. The half-yearly meeting.of this company was held yssterday at the of ios, Royal Exchange-buildings; Mr. Pocock in the chair. The report stated that the directors regret having again to meet their shareholders without being able to hold out the eospect of any immediate commencement of their works. rully believing that the time for active oerations cannot be long delayed, the directors yet think that they annot with prudence do better than wait the course of evrents. Some expenditure, however, wi3l be necessary for the repairs of that portion of the seawall which-was not repaired on the late occasion. They will take care, however, that in this necessary work every economy is observed, and nothing done that is not strictly required. The receipts durinfg the half-year ending the 30th of June amounted to 1,2871., and the expenses to 7221., leaving a balance of i5l. The CHcAIRMsAN, in moving the adoption of the re,port, stated that all their liabilities were now settled. There were no debts, and in future their expenses would be of small amount. In reply to questions, it was stated that the cost of r3 ;ring the seawall might possibly amount to 4001., but i; weas expected that l501. would be sufficient for some time to come. As regarded Twe sale of the property, they had no power to sell it, even it they had the opportunity. They had engaged to make a dock, which they believed would be a good property, and unless their powers were allowed tD expire by lapse of time they would not be in a position to dispose of their assets. Thc report was then adopced and the meeting separated. AMBERGATE, NOTTINGHAM, A?r BOSTO-N. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the Neew Station, Notuligham, on xonday; 1,ir. J. Wyles in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in T7re Times, having been taken as read The COsArIraAN moved that it be adopted, and regretteK' that the atition, owing to unavoidable circemstanc:o not been opened at the time they anticipated. He be_i that, though it might be regarded as a costly uuderts it would have a very beneficial result upon their i income. He lamented the great dacrease of . mir i traffie, but he had only to repeat wbat . ^ :rraorlersy sin. that when the traffic w-as fairly devet, ,ei wirough theirown station they would soon very materialfy increase the amount of ,heir dividends. He anticipnied, too, a very materiall additi,n tn their traffic, fromi the formation of the proposed line frotr Sleaford toBoston. Inreference tothistheyhadtheassurance of a gentleman thoroughly conversant with the coal fields that when there was a direct railway communication to Boston 500,t00 tons per year would be carried over the line for slhipmnent to France and other parts; and the Ambergate Company would derive an income from this source alone of 30,0001. per annum. He characterized thereport of the committee of investigation lately appointed to look into the affairs of the Great Northern as singularly unjust and untrue to the Ainbergate Company. Alluding to the working agreen;ent with the A mbergate Company, they said that the payment of 30 per cent. for working the line would always inivolve a heavy loss, and that at present it involved a less of 4,0001. or 5,0001. a-year. They entirely left out of consideration one fact, that the Great Northern by the means of the Ambergate Company had secured 50 per cent. of the Nottingham traffic. The Great Northern could not have got into he town of Nottingham at all without the Ambergate linie; and Mr. Gladstone in his award gave 30 per cent. of the passenger traffic, and a large proportion of the goods traffic. Mr. T. C. BiEASLEY seconded the motion. 3Mr. BU,lL1Y, of Leicester, expressed himself very much gratified with the observations of the chairman. He attributed the continued decrease of their coal traffic to the Great Northern Company consulting their own interests rather thar keeping their agreement with the Ambergate Company by encouraging the coal traffic from Yorkshire. This- belDg -the case, -he -saW very little prospect of any amendment in this department of their undertaking. The CHAIRAOXN said he believed itwas the full intention of the Great Northern Company to increase this part of their trade. The report was adopted, and a resolution declaring a dividend of 2s. 9d. per share for the half-year was also passed. Messrs. Wvles, Barbage, and Beesley were re-elected directors, and Mr. Hollins was ro-appointod auditor. The proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman. WEITELAVEN AND FURNESS JUNCTION. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Whitehaven on Friday, the Earl of Lonsdale in the chair. Mr H. Coox, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times. The CHAIRMAIN, in proposing the adoption of the report, congratulated the shareholders on the accomplishment of the event to which they had all along looked forward as a nieans of making their property remunerative. He alluded to the opening of the railroad from Ulver. ston to Lancaster, which gave therm a direct communication with the south. Their revenue for the last year or two had been grad nally increasing, and there was every probability of its continuing to do so in consequence of thegreat prosperity attending the iron trade in ali its branches. That pert of the country was peculiarly favoured with iroa ore, and there seem,ed to be every probability of that species of traffic increasing. They had obtained a new Act of Parliaruent to enable them to raise 70,000. on preference shares to discharge existing liabilities. 3y looking at the accoibts they wonld find that they were in dobt 40,0001,, which was not a large sum, At preseOt tbey only proposed to olbtKin the sarction of the shareholders to raise 0,410, hieth would. la,tirelI clear thenm of debt, and the remaining 2c,eOo. would be avaiable in case any uew woroks should be "dired for the increased traffic, He hoped that the rematinder, if it shoiild be required at all, vwould be sufficient to enable them to give the public all the advantages which would be required, and which might be rfecessary for the line to pay a fair dividend to the shareholders. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. B. WILSON had great pleasure in seconding the adoptioc of the report. He concurred in everything wnich the noble lord had said. From variouscircumstances whilch had come under his own observation he thought there was great probability of increased local trade in addition to the general traffic. The proposition wvas agreed to unanimously. MIr. LBa proposed that a dividend of 6aper cent. per annum, less income-tax, be paid to the preference shareholders. He believed that was the first timle they had been able to pay a dividend even on the preference shares, at the full rate of preferential interest. Mr. JW. FLETCHiER seconded the motion, which was agreed to. The Earl of Lonsdale, MÂ£r. W. 0. Gore, and Mr. C. Hopkeinson, three of the retiring directors, were then re-elected, and Mr. Sandmere and Mr. Walker were elected in the room of two direotors, who resigned. Mfr. George Bcokham was elected a director in order to increase the number of directors from 15 to 16. Mr. E. C. Boirne, the retiring auditor, was also re-elected. The meeting was then made special, and a resolution passed empowering the directors to issue preference shares to the extent of 50,0u01., to bear interest at the rate of 5.1 per cent. per annum, and be redeemable at the option of the directors at any time after the expiration of 10 years. Mr. G. IKsOX said the income of the company was now sufiicient to pay the interest on the additional preference shares they were about to issue. A vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings. !HITEHAYEN, CLEATOR, AND EGREMONT. On Friday the half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Whitehaven, Mr. A. B. Steward in the chair. IThe report stated that the quantity of iron ore conveyed over the lizne was considerable, and the quantity of coke, Iiron, coal, and-otber merchandise amounted to 32,226 tons, showing banincrease as compared with the corresponding period of-last year of nearly 97 per cent, on iron ore, and i195 per oent. on the remaining articles of traflic. The di, rectora recommended a dividend at the rate of 71. per cent. per arnum, which would leave a balance of 8714 to carry to the reserved fund. The additional siding at the Corkickle station having been completed to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade the line was opened for passenger traffic on the Lit of July. A vacancy haviDg been caused at the I Board of Directors by the disqualification of GeneralWynd- ham, X P., it had been flled up by the appointment of Mr. The CHwURIsAN' briefly proposed the adoption of the report, which, having been seconded, was unanimously agreed to. Mr. G. H. HEAD proposed a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent., payable on the 1st of September. Mr. DEES seconded the motion, which was also agreed to. iThe retiring directors, Mr. P. Fisher, Mr. J. Dees, Mr. J. Stirlig, and Mr. J. Idndow, and the retiring auditor, Mr. R. Gibson, having been re-elected, the proceedings terminated. BOSTON, SLEAFORD, AND MIDLAND COUNTIES. | Yesterday the half-yearly meeting of this company was held at the Euston EHotel, Mr. H. Ingram, hLP., in the cbair. The CsrAiRYAN said that half the work of completing the line was now finished and open to the public, and, so far as they had yet gone, the passenger traffic had exceeded their expectations. As regarded the goods traffic, all the arrangements for satisfactorily conducting it were completed, and it would open on the 1st of Septem- ber, so that he expected that at the next half-yearly meeting the directors would be able to declare a satisfactory dividend to the shareholders. (Eear, hear.) Be had the satisfaction of being able to state that the Ambergate and Nottingham Company were favourable to their line, not only in speaking /Well of it, but in I a disposition to aid in carrying it out to Boston. The rI layor of Nottingham had vistted the port of Boston, and was fully impressed with its importance as the most eligible place on the east coast for shipping the coal and - ther merchandise of the midland districts. Hfe was ac- ordingiy disposed to give them every assistance towards Comnleting the line to that port, and the inhabitants Of iottingham had subscribed largely to the underialing, sO Sh3t in the end their line promised to be one of the best lines in the kingdom. He himself held a large number of shares, and he would still further increase his stake. So far as they had yet gone, he 'was convinced that the Great Northern Company were inclined to work the line honestly. (Bear, hear.) I The Secretary then read the report, wbich stated that on the 16th of June the line had been opened for passenger traffic between Grantham and Sleaford, and that the receipts from it were most encouraging. The coalowners in the midland counties had broken faith with the company in their promise to contribute towards completing the railway communication between Nottingham and Boston. The sum of 30,0001. additional share capital would be required for that purpose, and a public meeting would be held at Not1 tingham for the purpose of gettiDg the inhabitants of that town to subscribe to the undertaking. The amount expended in the construction of the line was 94,9731. On the motion of the CHAIRYA?5, seconded by Mr. l ux,Cs the report wvas adooted. The proceedings thern terminated. HEREFORD, ROSS, AND GLOCESTER. The general half-yearly meeting of this company ws held cn Mfonday ; Colonel Vaughan, the chairman, presiding. The report; which was read by the secretary (Mr. Nash), showed by comparison with the half-year ended June 30 1856, an inerease of 1,2241., rather more than 11 per cent., over theJune half-year of 1858. The net balance of profit on thehalf-year,amountingtol,6361.,thedirectors recoru.mmended to be applied on account of capital, on which there still remains an adverse balance of 3.0101., to clear which, and also to meet some few other liabilities, will require the appropriation of the net revenue of at least one other half-year. The directors therefore very much regretted that the declaration of a dividend must again be deferred. The total disbursements to the 30th of June were 340,7841., leavinga balance against the company of 3,0101. The report was adopted, and, after some discussion on the subject of the present inconvenient postal arrangements, the meeting separated. - NEYWRY, WARRENPOINT, AND ROSTRElVOR. The half-yearly meeting was held yesterday at Liverpool; Mr. P. Shand pre>iding. The report stated that the Parlianmentary powers bave been fully obtained, enabling the Newry and Eaniskilien Company to extend their line to Armagh, and this company to join it, and also to lay rails along the Warrenpoint Dock. The whole of the 5.000 preference shares issued under the resolttion of the 28th of February, 1855, having been taken up, the directors propose to take powers to convert an addi- ;on41 sunm of 10,0001. of the outstanding debenture debt into similar preference shares. The -eport was adopted, and after passing other formal : . ldtions the meeting separated. | ST. A_NDREW'S AND QUEBEC. The hal'-ea^rly Loeeting of A shareholders in this compuny was he'd yesterday at Whitehall; Mr. Fry in the chair. M,. By ., the secretary, read the report, which stated that the Bill introduced in the late session of Parliaiment by the Ells Brunswick and Canada Railway and Land Com. - ay, hp.ing for its object the confirmation of the agree- ent ior the sale and purchase of the interest of the class - Company, received the Royal assent on the l7thinst.,vith a clause limiting the number of acres of the surplus land heretofore subject to the payment of the interest accruiing to the shareholders of the New Brunswick and Canada Company to 20,000 acres, and other amendments to the interest of the class A shareholders. The several liabilities referred tointhe schedule attbe footof thesaid rgreensent have been fully discharged out of the funds supplied by the Now Brunswick and Canada Railvay and Land Company, which they were bound to do under their contract. 'lhe statement of receipts and expenditure from the 31s5 of December, 1855, to the transfer of the property in O_at,-ber, 13d. sbowed that 11,2761. had been received and 1,.3S47. expended, leaving a balance of 8921., of which 8571. was claimed by the Receiver-General, leaving a balanceof SSI at the bankers'. On the motion of the CsIUgRMA2;, the report wasadopted, and the retiring directors, Messrs. F. Edwards, i. C. Chilton, and R. Fry, were re-elected, and also Mr. (;roves, the retiring auditor. Mr. BATES proposed a resolution instructing the board to prepare a scheme for a further agreement between them and the New Brunswick Company, whereby the expenses of the past management of the affairs of this company may be prevented, and that when such scheme shall be prepared a special meeting of the company be cailed to consider it. Mr. ScrAtRPE seconded the motion, and it was carried. A long discussion then ensued in respect to the disDosal and management of tbe land beloDgiDg to the company, whih result-ed in the adoption of a resolution proposed by Mr. BATES, and seconded by Mr. H1E.AP, to the effect that. it having been stated hy parties well-- a'cq-uainted wvith the facts of the case that the 10,009 acres of land claimed by Ir. Sharpe as his own private property were merely held bv hil as a trustee for the general body of shareholders, it was resolved that Mr. Bates, Mtr. Heap, and Mr. Goodchap be a committee to investigate the matter and renort upon it to the next meeting of the shareholders, and requesting the secretary to afford the committee all the assistance in his power and show all documents connected therewith. The meeting then separated. SOUTH-B ISTERN.
