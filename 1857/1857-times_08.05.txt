I T17T BRAZILS. I (A summary of- the' follbWing, received by electrio tele. gaph appeard in a second edition of yesterday:-3 SOUTHAMPTON, TuySDA. Thescrew ateamer Petropoli* belonging to the Hamburg. Brazilin line, Capt4in Theodore Paulsen, rrived this mornin# with advioes of the following dates:-Rio de Janeiro, July 2; Bahis, 7; Pernambuoo, 10; St. Vinoent (Cape Verds), 20; and Liabon, 30. She experienced Yormy andl rainy weather oi the coast of Brazil, trong north-eat trade winds from latitude 15 N., and continued north.eaet w1ids all the way to England, Butfor three day'detention at St. Vinoent, and delays at the different ports by arriving in the evening, this veesel would have 'beei here Eome day earlier4 The Petropolis landed, 40 passengers at Lisbon, and bring, 10 for Southampton, and 16 for Haimburg. 8he has a large cargo, among which are 61 bagpof orchillaweedfor Loindon, 132bags ditto, 1l,OCO bags of coffee, 15 serons of lpecacu ha, 1,500 bides, and 200 mangottes of toba oofor Hamburg. The PetrOpolis sailed for Hamburg tXis evening. The squadron of gunboatsfor China, 16 in nuaber, under Captain Osborn's ordes, had all arrived safe at Rio (only One death), and would leave for Java Head on the 3d of JUIy. There is no political'news by this arrival from Rio. Commercial advices are to the lIst of July. The new ce of duties for importation entered into practice from that day. A steady business in coffee bad been curied,on since the departure of the Medway, beginning at previous prices, but closing at au advance of about 100 reis. The ales of the fortnight were 107,000 bags; the total Waes of the month 208,000 bags, of which 101,700 were for the Channel and north of Europe, 18,500 for the Mediterranean, and 87,800 for the United States. Quotations wereWashed, 6,000r. to 6,800r., equal to 64. 6d. per cwt., free on boiad; superior, 6,400r. to 5,500r., equal to 53s. 4d. per OW., free on board; good first, 5,000r. to 5,30Wr., equal to 51B. Sd. per cwt., free on board; first ordinary, 4,8o0r. to 4,900r., equal to 48a. 3d. per cwt., free on board -for best of each. Of new coffees there was only a very limited quantity. AUl reports concurred in estimating the new crop at a very low figure, and if the balance of the previous crop sill remaining in the interior were ndt so considerable' the falling off of supplies would be severely 'alt. The supplies of flour had been very limited, but buyes showed little disposition to pay the higher prices aked by holders. The salt-market was flat, supplies being large. In freights a further slight reoovery hd taken place, 45s. to 47s. 6d. for Channel having been paid; Mediter. ranean, 47s. 6d.; United States, north, 50c, to 60c.; south, 900. to lOOc. Exchange for London, 28. had been the general rate; Hamburg, 650r. From Bahia we have no advices. Our correspondent at Pernambuco writes as foUows op the 10th ult.:- " This city was yesterdal' thrown into a state of great e citement by tho assiaination of Her Britannic MAjesty's V,Tice-Consul, Mfr.T. Gollan. Mr. Gollan ohntheeveningof the 8th In8t. accompaied Mr. Cowvper, Consul, to his home, and left to return at about half past 9 o'clock. Hlis body weas found shortly before midnight lying on the roadside pierced with 14 wounds, evidently inSiicted by a sharp and pointed k~nife. The scene of this horrible murder is close to one of our most public thoroughfares, and several persons pasd te spot a feuw minutes before the perpetration of the crime. His reain were interred in the British cemetery yesterday evening. The ceremony'was attended by his Exoellency the President of the province and by all the principtl authorities of the place. MIr. Golln wa of a peaceable and quiet disposition, and much respected. The dreadful event is stil wrapt in mystery, but a large reward has been offered for the discovery of the assassin, and the police authorities era doing their utmost to obtin some clue, but as yet unintcesefuSiy. A Portuguese hbs been arrested on suspicion, .bat no concludsive evidence has yet been adduced. "Produce without alteration.

L';AxGEu 's LxT1RS AD MxMORANDUM-BOOKL -The Glasgow Herald, in a lengthy article, alludes to the reports circulated concerning the letters and diary of the unfortunate L'Angelier, and Es,-" Of the contents of the memorandum-book much has been said, and the reputation of at least one highly respected lady connected with our own ity was associated with it in such a sinister manner as to occason the most distressing feelings to a la3o body of our best citizens. Her husband, to give the He to such shamefulrumours, applied tothe Crown for acopyof the me. niorsadum-book, and received in reply an assurance that neither he nor his lady was either named or indicated in any one of its entries; and we have reason to belieye that, apart fromI Abgeler'speculiarrelationtoMfadeleineSmit'n,neither that memorandum-book nor any other part of his manusaopt affords ground for the slightest imputation against the honour of any lMdy, either married or unmarried; and, further, that his corzespondenoe generally, so far from supporting the 'atrocious' character which has been ascribed to it, would, if patent to the public, convince them that if not a* Joseph Andrews, he was at least not a Tom Jones. The virtues of L'Angelier, from all we can learn, may still be satisfactorily traced ia his exemplary amiable, and studious course of life, unanimously testifleXto by histhbee landladiesj during the four years of his residence In GlS. gow-by the good opinion and promotion he won from his employers, and the respectable position he occupied at his death in one of the first of our commercial establshments-by the universal testimony of his businees asociates to his invariably temperate and correct deportment-by the filial and fraternalaffection and edlicitude and aid which he appears to have manifested and tendered towards his widowed mother and fatherless sters, and by his association here and elsewhere with sodet' of wh ch no gentleman could be ashamed. L'Ange. lier's 'sad, eventful history ' has reoently pointed m an a moral, and my yet adorn a tale; for we understand that his friezids in this city-and he, too, has hia influential fxe ds-are not content to let his memory lie undeki the -iotlaspersions which have been heape upou it. Th de*alklrg means, we-believe, by.1it PAsigeller' from his correspondence with his family and others, be hear4 in his own defence before the tribunal of public opinon; and when thesepapers seethelight it will be found wvedoubEtnot, that we have not written, as we now do writhout 'saome reason for the faith that is in us."'

The marriages increased in the ?oanufacturfug districtsin Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire, in Essex and Norfolk in Cornrall, ia Worcestershire, in Warwick. shire (and.notably in BiminZhiml, in Lincoinshire, in Nottinghaishire, in Cheshire, snd Lancashire (particularly in Manchester). The marriages tn Cumberland rose suddenly from 198 to 303; and in the whole of the four northern countiesfroml,738and1,871 in the winterquartcrE of 1855-56 to 1,989 In the winter quarter of 1857. Probably some of the swain who formerly indulged in the license of a trip to Gretna Green and the Scotch borders to marry have been induced, by the diffioulties which the new law Interposes to mary, In England. The great majority of the Scotch mArriages are now registered, and wo may hopc that the Scotch law reformers will ere long free Great Britain from the last stains of their defective marriage law, which, drawing no distinet line between clandesftne concubinage aid m&iage, tends to expose the young women of Bcotland to crael temptations and errors. * ~~~~~BIRTIIS. The births of 170,313 chIldren were registered in the quarter that ended on the 30th of June; and the births were at the rate of 3-546 annually, the decennial average being 3523. The number of births is less by 2,891 than tLe births in the corresponding quarter of 1856; hut it exceeds by 5,036 the births in the spring quarter of the war year TXCBXAS1 OP POPULATION. As the births were 170,313, and the deaths 100,205, the atural increase of the population of England and Wales was 70,108 in 91 days, The natural inorease of the population of the united kingdom probably exoeeded 1,100 daily. 93,100 emigrants sailed from the ports of the united king. dom in the quarter that ended on June 30th, and 35,414 of the number were of English origin; of whom 15,737 sailed to the United States, 6,459 to the North Amerioan coloniest 13,149 to the Australian colonies, and 69 to all other placer. THIE WEATHER AND TIE PRICE OF PROVISIONS, At the Greenwich Observaory the temperature wasbelow the average in April, above the average in May and Juno Saturation being taken at 100, the degree of humidity wa' 76, or one degree below the average. The reading of the barometer was slightly below the average. The faU of rain was 4 7 inches, or 2-7 inches below the average. The air moved at the rate of 78 miles daily. The intense heat in June was remarkable. The first eight days were warm ; 10 cold days followed; hot weather set in on the 19th, and on Sunday, the 28th, the temperature near the sea rose to 75 deg. ; at places between the latitnde of 51 deg. and 52 deg. it exceeded 91 deg., and even 92 deg.; in London it was 88 deg.; and at all the other places under observation somewhat below 90 deg. The 28th of June was the hottest day we ha-e experienced since July 6, 1846. It was also re. markably dry, the temperature of the dew-point falling at times during the day ful 35 deg. below the air temperature. The effects of the variations In the prices of food on the bihs, deaths, and marriages can be ttudied in the tables. The average price of wheat, like that of Consols, has been nearly the same as it was in the first three months of the year; it was 56s. 9d. in the 13 weeks of April, May and June, 1857, and consequently wheat Is cheaper by 23 per cent. and 17 per cent. than it was in the corresponding seasons of 1855 and 1856. In the London markets beef has risen 7 percent., while mutton has slightly fallen since last year. The high price of potatoes Is the most unfavourable circumstance in the table. The price of this important esculent was 59 per cent. higher in London than it was in the spring quarter of 1856. The abundant crop of fruit will, to a certain extent, supply its plae as an anti-scor butic; and we may hope that the present year's crop of potatoes will be more abundant. STATE OF THE PUBLIC EALTH. 100,205 deaths were registered in the quarter ending on June 30, and this implied an anuual mortality at the rate of 2-086 per cent. The mortality in the districts containing tho principal towns was at the annual rate of 2323-that F ,125 less than 2'448, the avenge of the preceding 10 spring qUArters. In the remaining districts, comprising chiefly small towns and country parishes, the reduotion in tie annual rate of mortality was '210; it was 1-873, while the average rate of the season was 2-083. The deaths in London have fallen progressively slnoe 1865, notwithstanding the increase of population, from 15,001 to 13,201; and the diminution has been proportionally most sensible on the south side of the Thames where the improvement in the water supply hu been greatest. The registrar of St. Jarnes Bermondsey, notes that to 208 births there were 86 deaths. This district, he says, " having suffered so fearfully during the prevalence of cholera, when the water supply was very bad, and tke open tidal ditches poisoned the atmosphere, it is very satisfactory to observe the exoeUent state of healtbh now existing, prov. ing the beneficial effects of good water, excellent drainage, paving, ceansing, &c.; and I may remark that an improvement is perceptible in the market gardens and in the foliage generally since the partial abatement of the smoke nuisamce." in Lambeth, Waterloo (lst Part), thebregistrar notesbIrths, 145; deoths, 55. The deaths are about 20 below the average of the three preoeding years. "I have a strong opinion," he says, " egarding the unwholesomeness of the water we have for yeasm been drinking. There is now a maked difference in the quality of the supply on this side the river, though there is still occasionally room for improvement. There has been no prevailing epidemic." The Registrar-General formerly caled attention to the effects of the bad water on the people of London; and tt e improvgment in the publc health that has been the result fully establishes the correctness of his remarks. The effects of the constant supply of the best water that can be pro cured have yet to be registered. In the Southern and the Eastern dividons thb deatbswers fewer than in the spring of 1855, and generally fewer than they were in the spring of 1856. Some partial epidemics of searlatina, measles, whooping-cough, typhus, and smaUpox, however, are mentioned by the registrars of these divisions, Two persons were kldled by lightning while taking shelter under a tree in Kintbury, Hungerford.* At Chalfont, Amershas, one death occurred in digging for chalk, this making the fifth death from that cause within two years, "owing to the careless mode of performing the work." In the west midland division, Yorkshire and the northern counties, the number of deaths in thespring of 1857 exceeded the number of de aths in the spring of 1855. In the north midland division, in Cheshire and in Lancasbire, the diminu tion in the number of deaths was not considerable. Among the districts In which the deaths were in excess of the deaths in tho previous quarters may be enumerated Cheltenham, Ludlow, Bridgenorth, Leek, Burton-upon-Trent, Lichfield, Wolverhampton (1,000 deaths occurred here), Walsall Westbromwich, Dudley. All the South Staffordshire dis tricts are in an unsatisfactory sanitary state. The pottery districts of North Staffordshire have been rerently supplied with good water, and their mortality has fallen considera. ably. Eing's Norton, Coventry, Hayfield, Chester (Great Boughton), Hull, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, havealso lost more lives th the wo previous spring quarters Many districts of the oountry stll suffer from marsh malaria, In Maldon, the Registrar says, IIAgue is very prevalent in Tollesbury, Goldhanpger Toleshunt-d'Arcy and its neighbourhood." The lower levels of the basin of the Thames as high up the stream as Oxford, and as low as Roo and Sheppey, suffer from malarious diseases in spring and autumn. Tho mortality on the high grounds at the ources of the Thames is at the average rate of 17 and 18 annual deaths in 1,000 living; in the low flooded districts on its banks the morbality rises to 20, 21, 22, 23 in 1,000 ;I Orsett, Essex, the mortality isat the rate of 24 in 1,000; in Hoo, the Isle of Grain, 24; and in Sheppey, ontaining Sheerness, 24 in 1,000. Thus in the marshy distriets the motlality Is raised from 17, the natural rate, to 24 in 1,000, chiefly in eonsequence of the noxious emanations froml a rich, ill-drained aoil. Sheppey may be taken as i type of the." distets. The inhabitants have that pauid,;-lue "at iloh Ccaracterize3 aguish districts; they frequently. suffer from ague, and sometimes from typhoid fever.

True, them tch v not reported. n T limes nor in BdWs Life, of Jly Gth, why I eannot say, as the atter journal inserted ln its nuner of July 12 an account of two matches a Eton of far les interest to Etonian in general. Yet suh was the fact; but of thi more anon. The gret objecEons' to the oontinuance of the publiechool matches at I rd' on the old system are, first the ex posure ofboys to thetemptationsof London; ad, secondly, which is of far less importnoe, the aeseoary detention of many of the boysfrom joinig thedr prents duing the tiune hat the matches were belngplayed The second objecUon is speedily.dispoKA of, for, u ayor very truly utge, that is the parent conern and not oum But the cas becomes widely different when the first 6bulec_ tion is considered. During a week which was the first of the Eton, and, I believe, of the nazzow holydays but the. third of the Winchester holyday, not. only the three, elevens, but also a very lrge proportion of the boys of each oltool wrer living ln'nd about Londoa for the purpose of laying or witnessng the Matches. Now, I sk any one. who knows anything of human nate, is it posible that out of the 200 or more Etoniana so livingsome Sith their parents, but tihe majority with more or less ditant relations, who would not wish to interfere too niuch with them-is it poesibs, I ay, tht a portion of these will not be introduoed by their more " iewing " friends and former schoolfellows into scenes at whichxnoparent wouldwish'hissontobepresent, andbcl come acquainted with oome of 'those phases of "town life" of which he had far better rmain for ever In ignorance I I recollect well that whenlwaaboyat Etonmany of the who haobtalned permission from their parent tobe in tondon during the week looked forwsrd with quite as-mueh pleuste to the liberty of a WelC In town as to theadtal witnessiing the matche I eousider, and I think mosd parents will agree with me, that the ehocking of theme, evils is not, a youl call it, "' most unneseasryattempt f0 supexrede the parental by the ma eerll authority." On the oontrary, that If we sanction An arrangement by whish these evis are rendered so probable we ar morally rempoci sible for the results that m}y ensue. It is to check these evils that an arrapgement has been- de by the authorities of Wincheter and .ton, by which the manual match,. Insteaid of be;ng played at Lord's in the holydays, is played during the schooltime at eachof tho scpools in alrna to yeiri. In this arrangement 'he authorities of Harrow were invited to join, but, forwhat reason I know not, as I bavo rnot seen the correspondencethey declinedtodo-ao.

ELECTION COMMITTEBS. DTJIJN (<LTY hlne committeo met agun at 11 o'clook yesterday. and pro"eded to. he . futer evidence ir aupport of the l.e4ttion.1 William Browue, a vintner, proved that at the lIa eecton lMchael Byrne lent him a 11.-note. He bad since repaid the loan, paitly i money and partly in goods . ?r. Thomas Benson, treanser of tie Rem-lane Society, produced a list of 56 members of that societ7 who had leceived 2s. 6L each for attending the nomination. Tbey 'were paid at' the roo=s in Ross-lane. The money was I taken from the fund in his hands made up by the ordinarl subecriptions. He drew 101. out of the bhak on the week of the election. These persons vere paid in consequence of a resolution paed at a meeting of the society at *hlhb Mr. TIlly was present. Besides the 101. be drew out of tbo bank he then had a further sum belonging to the society in his possesson. The witnees was then examined as to the persons who gcnerally attended the meetings in Bossilane, and as to t.e speech made by ll)y alterthe election with regard to the promises he bad given. Ly said. they ehould not expect to hear any talk while a petition 'wa3apendlng, thcat they should be guarded in answering quetizons, and that they should not eptea~ untrue reports, also that he wvould a.bide by anything he had said. At an earlier date he heard Lilly say that they would have a good dinnier when this was a!l over. Witness blamed him for making a promise of a dinner wben perbas he would not be able t fulfil It. LWy replied that a couple of gentlemen bad promised him 11. a-piece towards the dinner. Thero was a desultory conversation as to what was elpected. He heard inquiies as to 'whether there would be anything going, but he oould not remember any' particular question being put to illy. Wit aesq bad himself been asked whether there would be anything going on at the election. He always repiedathat there would not be a sinBgle farthing given, that if those %ho asked him had ever received anything before they would not again-that neither Mr. Groan nor any one else would peril his seat by giving gjthiZ He mever rerzed any of them to Mr.I3y. i e dnoth nor eanev g about the queston put by people to Be,% respecting his promiece but he beard Lilay say one night, II suppose you 'will ex pet to hear something from ian; anything I pronised I T fulfil." He supposed Lilly made that statement in consequence of baving been annoyed by questions put to bim, by different persons as to whether there would bo anything going on. He suppoe those queations related to rnoney. The questions -were not put publicly. He tbought it was wrong of LIllyto speak aout adinner. The men who attended the nomination were paid ior their loes8of tinme, becanse they 'were kept away from their work. They attended in order to protect their friends. It was unfortutnately a custoa in Dzblin for people to attend coutroversial meetings in order to proteot their friends, although there was a large polioe ftrce in the city. He did not remember any particular meeting just before the expiration of the timefor presnting petitions. He remembered being present when a geteral conversation tookplace aoxt a petition. 'He could not remember sliether Lilly said anything about it. It ws in every ene's mouth. Be had made somne erasures in the list of entries, as he fonandton looking it Over that itrequired Eomne corrections. The witness as then examined with regard to some of the entries in the list as to which he gave ex; lanati( ns Cross-examnined.--He had been connected with the Ross lane Society from its oommencement. Farrae would hav3 been dismissed for drunkenness if be had not resigned. The society consisted of persons of strong Protestant feeling. Two menmbers were expelled for voting for a Roman Catholic candidate. It was a benefit society, and they were In the habit of giving loaves and small sums of money. He ,was not aware of any promise haviilg been made to any freeman for his vote. He always gave a decded answer to pplications of that kind andsaidtat inhis opinion Messrs. Naneo and orogas would not spend a farthing improperly. EveFthing that he had hear tended to show that the election would he conducted on the purest principles. In 1852 some of the freemen were dissatisfiea at not having received anything for their votes, and that dissatisfaction was renewed in 1857. The freemen who were paid for atteudance at the meetings 'were selected promiscuously. They shouted for Vance and Grogan. He did not see them do anything else. No one vms beaten. By the Corsirms-He did not enter the 2s. od. each pald to the freemen In the accounts, because the secretaxy left about that time and things were in confusion, and there was a talk of a petition. He had not been repaid that expenditure. It came out of the funds of the society. He applied for a committee to examine the accounts and make the entries, bhut they 'ere afraid to enter anything because of the petition. They heard that treating ws wrong, even out of the funds of the society. It was customary to make up the accounts every quarter. He heard Mr. Vance make a speech before the election, lvubich he alluded to the 5001 prenised by himself and Mr. Grogan in 1852. Something Ead been said about the promise not having been fulfilled, and lIr. Vance said that he and Mr. Grgan had made a londfide offer of 5001. to the Protestaut Orphan Society, to be paid if the society would raiso another 5004, but as the society had not dtone so the money had not been paid. Mr. Datton produced the accounts of the election expenses of the sitting members, which, among othera thlnrg, contained an entry of 261. 14s. to John Lilly for making out lists and other services and expenses Mr. M'DosouGr said therewers other witnesse to prove the case of bribery who had been ttelegraphed for from Dubli, but Mr. Slade objected to any fresh. cases being opened a ew witnesses ad inflni4um nmight be sent for from Ireand". The ComrNsrsr said they would proceed with tho case of treating wvithout at Dresent deciding whether fresh wit. nesses as to bribery shoald be examined. Mr. Benson was then recalled, in order to he examined with respect to various items In the accounts of the soieey of refresbmenxts sapplied to freemen at the meetings. Objection having been taken to the reception of evidenee of tzeating before proof of agency had been given. The CoyamTrzE. after beam the arguments of the learned counsel on either side, heldthat there was sufficient pri7na facie evidence of the agency of IMlly for them to proceed 'with the evidence of treting afecting bim. The committee then adjourned until this day. DROGHEDA. At the itting of the committeo yesteidaT, hr. Bernard Kelly, tbe election auditor, produced the accounts, and stated tha Mr. X'Cann's expenses amountod to 3261. los. Cross-examined.-There was in his opinion less excitement at the lut electior than at that of 1847. Hle did not think it would bh neceassry to spend as much as 1,200& or 113001. in contetbiDg the borough. The constituency con. slated of about C50 voters, most of 'whom were residents. He did not think that Captain Moore would have had a mnajQrity of 45 or 60 if he had gone to the polL Be-exanined.-There was more damage done to houses at the last election than in 1847, but in 1847 there was a largir military force in the town. Mr.. J. T. Rowland, A solicitor and voter, said, he acted is Captain Moore's agent at the last election. On the Wed. ne"day evening his windows v,ere broken by the mob, and he rushed out and knocked down two fellows, upon which the rest went away. Mis house was not afterwards attacked, but vhe mob tried to break open his father's hose, and ha drove them away. His brother, slso a voter, was beaten. His father voted for Mr. M'Cann. The witness then gave an ascount of the conduct of the people on the Tuesday and on the nomination day, similar to that given by the previous witneeses. His fater, he added, obtained compensation, he believed about 21., for the breaking of his windows. There ws less violence in 1847 than at the last election. The unpopular candidate then was Sir William Somerville, amd he obtained a hearing. Father Hanratty spoke at the nomination, and said that the contest was between Catholicism and Orangoism, and that any one who voted for Captain Moore would vote for the opening of the convents to profigate young men, such as some of those who were present. The violence of the mob increased in consequence in his opinion, of the violent language of the priests. twould not bave been safe for Captain lMoore to go to the poll although, if there had been no violence, he believed that Cptain Moore would have had a majority of 20. He would have had that majority even if he had been deserted by a large party, while, if he had not been so deserted, his majority would have been about 100. Cross-examined--He did know that his father did not get more than 10s. compensation for the iniury to his homse - 21. was the sum to which he thought his father entitled. His father was a linen maufacturer. For some weeks previous to the election the weavers were on strike, but he did not know that they were mnuch exasperated against their employer. The election of 1847 wasmuch quieter than the last. He received 101. for his services at the election, and be had no further clim. On the Saturday previous to the election, before, he believed, Captain Moore came forward, the question of the expense of the election was discussed at lr. Kelly's, and an estimate was made of 1,0001. or 1,2001. Edward Fiay, a voter, said, he had promised to sunport Captain Moore, but on the Tuesday or Wednesday Sefore the election he was sent for to Mr. Cann's tally-rooms by Mr. I'Cann's two sons. He went tbere, and saw Mr. M'Cann's sons and several other gentlemen. He was asked whether he would vote for Mr. M'Cann, but be said he would not promise. He wa followed down stairs by Mr. Long, who said, " Won't you vote for M'Cana? Here's an order for oa. worth of drink." Mr. Fnii objected to the reception of evidenice with regard to Mr. Long, who was not Mi. l 'Cann's agent. Mr. SLADE submitted that hevwas entitled to have the evidence received, as Mr. Long was a member of Mr. Al' Canes committee. After a short discussionthe witness Finlay, who had withdrawn during the argument, was recalled, but before his examination was resumed he stated, in reply to a question ut by Mr. PuiiNs that since he had left the room Dr. AtrInson had asked him wshether he had the drink given him on the Tuesday or on the Wednesday, and he replied that he could not recollect, The CrAIRxAN reprimanded Dr. Atkinson for putting questions to a witness under exalination. Dr. Atkinson said, he had been requested to put the question bv Mr. Mfayne. The CHAIEMAN said, Mr. Mayne haVzoted very improperly and ought as an agn tO have known better. On the Application of Mr. PFii, Dr. Atkinson was ordered to withdraw v while the witnesses weze being examinedL Pinlay was then About to be examined with regard to the asts of one of Mr. Wherty, whose nam6 was upont Mr. 2l'Cann's committee, but Mr. PNx objected, contending that themembers of self. constituted commnitteee, not appointed by the candidates, could not be regarded as agents. The CAiWsA.5 -aid, the publication of aperson'sname in the lit of a committee would not be rogarded as proof of Mr. SDLAE said, that such publioation, taken in conjunction with other acts of the alleged agent, would onsditute a person an agent.

On the motion of Colonel TAYLOR, a new writ was ordered for tht eletion ot alburgess for the borough of Beverley, In the room of E. A. Glover, :Esq., whose election has beon dedared void. PROBATES AND LETTERS Op ADiTpR,&Tr, B3ILL. On the order of the day for the recommittal of this Bill, with the view of Introducing amendment-, Mr. HAD FtXLD enpressed. a hope that the Attorney. General would reconsider the scheduledefining the districte, which it aeemed to him would be of very unequal extent. In reply to wome observtions from Mfr. HuxLEY, The ATTORNEY-MGERL said his right hon. friend had last night called his attention to the drc-unstnce that there were certin archdeacons who performed judicial fanctions In their own courts, and thus obtained e uaan1eat fot t'h lots of wbich under the Bill iz it stood they would be unable to obtain compensation. He would suggest that his right hon. friend should give notice of an amendment to 3meet sach cases, or that he should move the additionmt the itepretation cause of words declaring that the term 'judge " should include all archdeacons performing personaly judicial functions in their own courts. With regsrd to the observations of the hon. ixem fr tosherI edI, e tthe Attorney-Geaeral) did not think that any blame could be attributed to the Government, who had done all in their power to secare a satisfactor arrangement of distcts The schedule had been the mablect of discuasioen dauric a. Vwhole night, when he ated that In the formation of dis. tricts the objects of the Government had been to continue ea places where probato should be granted those country towns where diocesan registries or courts *.t preset edstea, to consult the convenience of the public, and so to atrange the districts that, generAlly speakinog tho duties of registration mnlht be discharged by ono offloer. He stated on that oocsion that, adhering to the p cif&a ha had. 1lD dorwn, the schedule wou)d be open to any suggestions of alteration, upon which the House would determine, Since that discussion of a schedule which had been before the country for many weeks, he had received innumierble spp.Tca'ious ashg ior alterations in the schedule, and now st the twelfth tour the hon. raember for Sheffield came forWad with a general com plaint against the schedule. There were a number of specifio pro oIL the pper pen'hich th& ouse woniddecide, but he muct say he thought there wai not the least reason for the complaint of the hon. zen. tleman, He (the Attorney_General) had endeavoureda t great personal Inconvenience to give his carefl eudera tion to Rl the representations rade to him by parties whose interests would be affected by the measure. Lord GODERrCH wished to ask whether he had corectI~ understood the hou.ausllearne& gentman to sayt la were abolished in matrimonial as wellsin satestametr causes they would receive coupensation for the abolitioao thab brnach of their business ' The ATTOENEY.GENERAL replied in the affirmative The House then went into committeelroforofoMA when several amendments were made and some new clauses wer added to theBi.L The House xesumed, and the Bill ws ordered to be printed. BURIAL ACTS A31ED1MET BfLL. The order of the day for consdering thi ills s aend.d baving been read, severa new clauses were introduced. Mr. GLADSTONE moved a claurseproviding that if upon application in writing by any burial board to the bishop of the diocess for the couacmtionx of &burial-ground declared to heo in a fit and proper condition for the purpose of inter. meat the bishop should refuse to consecrate the same, the bura board might appeal to the archbishop of the province, 'who should d2id. themAtter in Wispute; ana tht, if the arhbishop decided for the oonsecration and the bishop did not consecrate the ground within a month, the archbishop should license the same for the interment of bodies. The right hom- getleman sad he rIght, perhaps, on azcount of the eminence of the person concerned, be allowed to take that opportunity Qf referrinig to words which were supposed to have fallen from him-thongh he thought they were not thow-rds t ht *IA fa from him-during a former debate on this subject, and which had given pain to an, individual who from his offlice and his personal qualities wa equay entitled to respeet. He alluded to the Bishop of St. David's. O wing to somoemaapprnehexonwhic' mxUst necessarily occur in the abbreviated reports of discdions in committee, he . Gladstone) was supposed to have made himself responri blefora statement that the Bisdop of St. David's had declined to obey thew h, a& ih%e te oUg t to be coeroed into obedience. He wa sure the House must be aware that he never could have been guilty of such an act of rashness. He was totally unacquainted with the circumstances of th Swasea c3ase, 'bs rie omIenting pon the observations of the hon. Under-Secretary for the Eome Department (Ur. 3assey), and knowing nothing whatever of the law or the facts, he said that if the lar and the facts were aa they were repTesentedby the organ of the Government, and the ca'e was one which justified interference, it appeared to him that it a bishop disobeyed the law, such ishop ought, like every. body else, to be made to obey the law. The principle of our conitoituion'wan, thathelaw 'was above every one ; it was above the Sovereign, it was above the Rlous of Lords, and it was sbove the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) The lxvr was the only absolute supremacy acknowledged in this country, d.howeverhigh any functionary migh be if he clad not obey the law ho ought to be md ooe t Ea. As to giving anY opinion that the bishop had disobeyd the law, he (Mr. Gladstone) stated at thetiehahecudo- cene n%mootoimprobsible; but vahdtocep a emet slecouldnot coz,trovert 0n fte eiso jud notjdge. David's was both pon ersoal and official gon;ette.t h highast respect, nauhe dmr Gladsto e h ere was anD' man in the country who would give more ready submison to the law, or who would with a more resolute determnation fulfil all the duties of a loyal subject es well as of a hishop et the church, than the right rev. prelate. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MASSEY, who spoke with his beck to the gallery, and wa occasionally very imperfectly heard, saUldthit 'when +ia Bill was last under discssion, in proposing a clause of a somewhat anomalous chaacter, which was censured by his right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone), and was, doubtless, open to agood dealof criticism, he stated in utfraino the corse he Pused, that in his opinion-which con. curred with that of many other persons-somie of the bisho had put an unreasonable construction upon the clause in tore exisng Bnrials Act, which enabled them,t exoiscsze a iscretion 'with regapr to the consecration of new burial. grounds. He stated that he thought that discretion had not I some cases been properly exercised, and he therefore deemed It his duty to propose a clase wbich wonuld. r, twn7l remQedy the grievance resulting froma the refusa4'o boish to consecrate burial-grounds. He also stated that One bishop had refused to consecrate a cemetery upon grotMdS which were utterly untenable in la2w, snd that statement be Dow repeated distinctly and 4ad visedly. The right rev. prelate waa, however, nistaken in SUpposing that the clause WAS framed s I with reference to his case. it 'a i1 referenAce to oase of difficulty whichhdaie,adh (r. Msse) morely alluded to thethe Bishop of t. David's as an illustration of the necessity of the clause. t twould be irregular for blmntoreter tothe mode 'which the right rev. prelate had adopted of contesting the propriety of the clause, and disputing the grounds upon w=ich it was recommended; but he (Mr. aey) felt i t due to his own character to tte that he had not na I tle Rose, that he had not suppresed facts, and that he wlas not ignorant of the eirenmstances of thio fght rev. pro late's case. He had forborne to mention the right rev. prelate's name because he regarded his conducLt aso tso 1 vmajustiablo in point of law that he was not desirous to con. nect such disebedience to the law with the namne of a di nitary of the church who, as the rght hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) jostlysaid, possessed many elaims toespt I buithe stated that that right rev. prelate had refused to con. seqrate a buralgrotnd in his diocess on the ground that the burial board refused to provide for the oonvoyanoe of the incumbent to the cemetery. He (Mx. laseys) min. tmied that that was not a aufficient reason to warant the bishop ia withholding the rite of consecration, and his opinion wag founded upon the expres words of the 16th and 16th of Victoria, chap 85, soc. 30, which provided that burmsgrounda mht b conted by the bishop of the dlowess 'when hosme 7soula apper to lm to be ift fnd proper conditioff for the po. The criterion for the exercise of the bishop's minsterial dtty was therefore the eondition of theogcound. The oonstraction which the birhop 1i fit to put upon the cluse ws, however, that be wara entiiled to demana from the burial baard the performanoc of an agreement which was entirely voluntary on their park and, to which no moa of commnon wense could sappoe that Cmi section ot the Buri Act was applicable. He [Mr. assey) had spoken upon the authority of papers which were upo9n the tible of theHoue.-namcy, the corespondenoe which ha taken ple between the bishop, the Sbuial 'oad, Vtkecretary of State. The bishop was inforrood b the burial board that It was the unanimous opinion of treir oomnmtteo that they hld not the power of providing a c6nveyanco for the itcumbent. A few days afterwards the besadywa espectfullyrequired the bishop to oOnDste tle ground, eugge6tng at the same time that a licenia for t4e uc of the ground would be sufficient. To that appUcl. t1pni the bisbhop replied that he must decline either to coneev~te tro licene 5 buraigrouna until the committe of the buial board roeonsidered their determination, which b1 believed they hed adopted upon a totaly erroneous iiew of the circustances of the cam. The butial boad then e*histd a able eounsd, who said distinctly that the bieho ha noright to erect such a conadition as that oD whicdh nhe insistd. eThis was oommunicated to tl~ebisop,whorenewed his proposiition in another, fugin, requ5rin~t'he brial board to enter into a contract with hum to comauto the fees of the incuabent foka fxedsum ItwAs quite competent for the bishop, the incumbent, and the burial board to enter into an ar- a,i sn. *t that siature, bat such Sn Arrangement Was ent0ikelypernsissivand the refusal of its accepotnoo did not n t b op in withodigthe rite of consecrtion. It pnthat groun ln that the negotiation -was "ding. Tho negotiation was not completed, and it did qtSappearto himthtit everwould be completed.

It was most distreding to him to refer to a dignitary ot the church, and one, too, w1;owas entitlea to igh respectk in what might ap&e,r tetma of ceure; but he believed tbat the right rev. pre ate to whomn he had alluded had violAted the lawF, and stil contlued to violate the law. He (Mr. JMsy) would orly add that be would rady assent to the clause proposed by the rfght hon. member for the University of Oxford. Or. DILLWfl was very unwilling to prolong the debste, but he wished to make a few obwervations upon mzatter which were in some degree personal to kimself. So longago as Ist Friday a statement appeared in the columns of TBt Timst new:ar, under the high authority of the B3isho S p of St. DAvid's which impugned his veracity, and aocused him of conealing fards from the House. He would not have tronbled the House on the subject if an opportunity had been afforded him of answering those Impuations ia the paperIn whicht.hey appeae-The Times The sttement caught his eye at his ciab.

He felt th4t, after the able statement of the hon. gentleman (Kr. Me4seY), it unnceAry for him to occupy much of the th4e of the House in replying to the charge, or the impliod chArge made Against him. hy the right rev. preate. Every o4 who had read the letter of the right rev, prelate was awre that he professed to suppose thst he (Ur.. Dillwyn) ha7 been very much miaeported- hut, although the ipsis. kmt verba housed were not gtiren 1n the paper, the Lbstract ofis speech hWas on the whole a very fair one, and he did no wish to complain of It. The words he actually used, hoirever, would not bear the precse interproetation put upon them. TheBishop of Stg DasiaaiidAhisletter,- '. I observed, Sir, that I believe the report of the debate In xne Vim4s to be substantilly correct, with one remairk. able exception. I allude to the spoech attributed to Mr. DiIwyn, the member for Swansea. Mr. D)ilwyn was of co5 roe fully aware of all the main fact which I have stated, anv particularly of the reoent proceedings in the Swansei tou n-conocil with regard to the question, of compensation to bhe icar. It is, therefore, in the strictest sense of the , yerb, morally impossible that in his place in the House of <)ommons he can have said, as he Isreprted to have dode, that 'I me for considdertion hadbeea n gixven to the right rev. crelate in question, and there was no prospect of an amicablea) settlement."' Novw, he (Mr. Dillwyn) had not exactly intended to convey the impression that there was no prospect of an amicable settlement; but he did sA, and he intended to say, that full tiue for consideration had been given to the right rev. pre. lase, and that no amicable settlement had been effected. He (Mr. Dillwyn) was quite prepared to hold to that statement, and to maintain that the settlement of which the light rev. relate spoke in his letter as having been partially made ad not been carried out, and that it was very doubtful whether the matter would be settled by the town-council of Swansea. He found from the Ssuns Journdl of the 11th of NY that a long discussion had taken place in the towncounci respectin the vicar's fees; it ws suggested that 10n a-year should be awarded, but a leading member of the council objece to that suiount and proposea 75L a-year. It a;ppeared also that a claim for compensation had been put in b the parish clerk. The subject was again bronght before the town-council on the 25th of July, when it wai urged that the pr%oved argemen with the vicar reVu,red much consideration- and it was recommended tDa the discion should be postponed until the next meeting. He (Mfr. Dillwyn) had heard from varous correspondents that it was very doubtful whether any setlement would be arrived at between the board and the vicar, because, although many parishioners who were members of the church of England were xious that such settlementt should be effected, a very strong and ang ben excited by the conduct of the biahop an the incumbent. He would say, however, that the oishop had no right to complain, for if he considtred the question virtually settled why had lie not consecrated or licensed this burialground? (IHear, hear.) For six months past the inhabitants of Swansea had been de. prived of consecrated ground for intermnts, to which, as the Under-Sereatary of Satte had said, they had a legal right, because the bishop chose to exercise his power ille. gally in order to drive the town into a compromise with the vicar. He (fr. Dllwyn) thought the bishop had no ground frormUugg his conduct as he haa done in his Jeter. At the same time he (Mr. Dilwyn) must express his sinceme regret that he should in any degree have come into collsion with a right rev. prelate whom he had the honour of bnowmg, and for whom he enterained great respect, He woald, howaver, repeat that he did not believe any settlement-at all events, any amicable settlement-was lkely to be arrived at between the burial board of Swansea and the vica. Ir. HOPE aid that, as the hon. gentleman (MEr Mssey) had repeatedly and emphatically aeserted that the Bishop of St. vavid's had acted in flagrt violation of the law, he begged vo tsk whether the law was not strong enough to vindicate itsel ? (Eear, hear.) Was it not a great grievance and wrong that a, right rev. prelate of known ability, who wau highly and generally respected, should be chargeI b n lion. entleman in an official po3ition with brealdngthe law, wit out having the opportunity of that fair triAl to which the meanest man in this country was entitled? (Hea, hear.) MTr. &DABIELD supported the clause, and expressed a hope that it would have the effect of putting a stop ts the scandalous proceedings which hsd occurred with respect to burlalgrounda. Was it not a scandal that a prelate of the ehtrch of England, who was warned that he was violating the law of the land, should set an example of disregarding that law? (A laugh.) He (lfr. Iladfield) would like to know why the hon. member for Swansea (Kr. Diliwyn) had ntr advised his oonstituents to apply to the Court of Queen's Bench in order to compel the right rev, prelate to do his duty. ("'Hear, hear," And laughter.) The fact was it was hightime he rltes were taught that EO long as they ye. cereic tse pay of the State they were tho servants of the State, and must do the bidding of the State; and if they wanted freedom of conscience let them leave the church and come over to those who agreed with him. (Laughter.) Mr. RIDLEBY supported the clause. Lord EBR[NGTON concurred with the hon. member for Sheffield that the legal liability of the bishop ought to have been submitted to a court of law. In the dioce$s which had the misfortune to be presided over by the Bishop of Exeter (a laugh severaldisputes of this kind had occurred ; and he thougnt it highly desirable that bishops should be taught tbat, although they might lord it over incuoobents aud urates, they were themlselves subject to authority, and that they would not be allowed with impunity to treat the anthority of the archbishops with contempt. E-. BWDE%G E ilcough; the clause vwould be detrimental to the interests of the church. Mr. SALISBTURY approved the clause, but expressed a doubt whether under the Act to which the hon. undersecretaxy iMr. Masey) had referred bishops could be compelled to consecrate barialgrounds. The clause was thea put and agreed to. Mr. KNIGHET moved several clauses, the object of wvioh were to trassfer the power of making regulations for burialgrounds from the Secretary of State for the Home Department to the burial boards. After A Ehort conversation the caues were negatived without a diyisson. Mr.t4LADSTONE renewed his objections to clae 9, which as intended to meet the evil of chronic disagree Vierts lbetween bishops and burial boards with resect to the consecration of burlalgrounds. It appeared to him by no ams clear what the opuation of the clause was intended: taf b4.btIt wjss g his op ruzendered nuneces.~r by the I e tr thathb lord it o Goven' ment would not force the Housat this period of- the. ses. Alon to discuss a mneaswre of so nach i)portinee (H Ibhear.) The noble lord, no dopbt,- had a great dealtoateu,I nt'o be expeted titheatlieshuld attend mcrh toZthe d etailsofthi Bill. lHe ould there. fore understand the good faith with which the noble lord said he could not se why the Hous should not go on with the Bill. He must do the noble lord the jusice to spy that he bad one trsnadent nerit and did not negleot his own business, but wa always present when the,Governusent Bills were before the House. (Cheera) But how long did the noble lord Intend to keep Parlianent biting? would. ha have no ootnpasslon upon members? (A laugh.) The noble lord had complimented him upon his vigour of body wad mind, but he could assure the noble lord that he was utterly oxhausted and worn down (a laugh), and that other members were in even a worse state. Did the noble lord intend to exhaust hon. members this aiop nd. prevent them from cominghack whenParliament again met? (A laugh.) Anhon. raember had disoovered a blow in the sixth clteuse, and there was anpt4er blot in the eighth clause which weuld render the Bill unworkable. The measure ought at once to be withdrawn. It was introduced in the other House prepared he knew not how, or by whom. It professed to be founded upon the repoet of a commission which carao to the conclusions arrived at by the right boo. gentleman the member for Cambridge University. ThAt right hon. gentleman was a -man of dDDi vpleidy of mind, who never formed an opinion wltnout grevt care, and did not like to part with it when he had formed it. (Cries of " Oh !" and "Divide V1) From the pecdmen which the noble lord had seen to-night, he must be convinced of the hopelessness of getting through th%Zill this session. The. Attorney-General had obtained the sanction of the House to tbe second reading by a la m- jority, and if he withdrew it he might apply his seisure during the roe to remove the imperfections with which the Bill now abounded. (Hear.) Lord PALMERSTON said that hon. gentlemen on the other side kept asking hir wFhen the seslon waslikely tobs over. He would remind them, in reply, of the very sacious exhortation of the late Mr. O'Connell to public meetings. r. O'!onnrll used, to zay, "Don't al call out for silenoe, for If you ll call silence there never wil be silenco." (A laugRh) In the saieway, if hon umembers consumed a great part of the evening in asking when the seasion would be over there would be very little ceance of the session ever being over. (Laughter.) The hon. and leared membsr for Walngford informed him it was quite hopeloss that the Bill could pass through ita various stages, and recommended him to withdraw it. Now, he was of rather asana e disposition (a laugh), and was not at all accustoredto ffotnder In thb SlouIh of Despond. He could therefore e the hon. and learned gentleman that he was not hopeless of passing the Bill, and that he should not become hopeless of pasing it until tho measure arived at its hat sta;e and the House affirmed by a large majority that Lt would not paitatall TheBMllhadoccupiedtheserious attention of the whole Government, and if as the hon and learned gentleman implied, he had not ten an activepart in the discuson, it was because the measure had been in such able hands that It would have been presumption iany one not a mcmber of the legal profession to attempt to furnsh better arguments than those of his hon. and learned friend the Attorney-GeneraL He really hoped that hon. members would not be led away by the idea that the Gover. ment wero likely to give up the Bill. (Hear, hear.) He did not complain of the length of the diseusion. It was natural that members should desire to expres their opiniors on the subject. The Government were not anxious to curil improperly the discussion, but were ready So $t there u manynights or weeks as might be necessry to carry on the dicussion. (Hear, hear.) But when the hon. aud learned member made an appeal ad miserecordiuss on the ground that the House was exhaunted by the length of its labours, he must be allowed to state that the sesion in this Parliament had been very short, for it did not begin till about the' middle of May. If the house had been sitting from November throu h the winter and summer up to the present time, it mighto expected that some hon, members not so strong as the hon. an leaned gentleman might think that they had done enough; but, considering how short a time had been con. sipned during the present session, he did not believe that hon. members would grudge a further attendance in order to considermaturely, as far as might be noessary, this and other measures of great importance si depending before the House. (Hear, hear.) Mr. GLADSTONE had listened with some amusement to his noble friend's statement witx regard to the shortness of the seedon, seeing that three-fourtha of the members had boen sttin in that Hous since the month of January, their attendanc being interzupted only by the agreeable interlude of a geeral election, and that his noble friend one or two nighso ago, in reply to an appeal from the noble lord the 2aember for London, maintained that the seIon must be considered not from the time at which it began but at that at which It would conclude. (" Hear, hear " and laugher.) Bi noble friend had had an affiation of the principle of his Bill by a decisive majority and no doubt the inuority ought to bow to the fairly expessed will of the majority; and if his noble fzlend caoee to persevere with the measure they must struggle on at whatever personal inconveniene, and maturely discus3 the provisions of the Bil. Still it could not be maintained that the-Bill was of a nature peculiarly urgent to be pa ied n the present sesson. (Hear, bacr.) e -would- do remind his noble friend that the same duty a bound the minority to comaply vith the declared optnion of the majority on the prnciple of the Bill did not sbsolve them from the obligation of watching, discussing, modifying, and altering the provlions of the measure. (Hear, hear.) As an opponent of the Bill it might aswer his purpoee to retire from the committee altogether, and cepart into the country, allowing the Bill to pas with all its blemishes; but such a course be held to be contrary to his duty, and he conoeived that it was incumbent on those who objected to the Bill to attend there night after night and week after week, to debate line by ine and word by word, if necessary, the detils of a Bill otsuch great importance. (Tear, hear.) In what position did the House find itself that night? After a discussion carried on exclsively by gentlemen who had not hitherto had an oportunity of expressing their sentiments on the mneasure, t e House went into committee, and had passed seven clauses nominally only. The committee had hardly passed any clause of importance. The sixth clause, it was true, had been passed, but in Mgassin that, after anhour's discussion, it was found that there wa a at p I the Bill, and the Attorney-General announced to te House that he would have important provisions to proo to supply that gap. (Hear, hear.) The comnuittee had now come to the first of other important clauseg, relating to the constitution of the court, and the Attorney-General, valuing his reputation as a, alest beyond any temporary or momentary advantage, fraly confessed that he bad benu at imsue with other great authorities on this vital point. (Bear, hear.) Therefore, hon. members were not to be kept sitting in that House simply for the purposo of discussitg a Bill on the provisions of which the Ministers had made up their minds, but they were also to be kept there while the Ministers should be considering with the Attorney-General what should be the constitutlon of the court, either over. riding the Attorney-General or being ridden over by him on that subject (Hear, hear.) Under these cirunstances hethought tbat matter had been laid for some further con. uideration on the part of the Government as to the course thabs should be taken with respect to the Bill. (Bear.) The ATTORBNEY-GENETRAf said the statement of the right hon, genUteman was totally at variance with the facts of the case. ("Hear, hear,' and A lsugk) It was undouzbt. edly true tbht be comndered that before the Bill was pased by the House of Lords it would have been better to e nrge the number of judges of whom the Court was to be constituted, but he had not been at ianue with noble and learned lords on that subject. His attention having been called to the circumstance, which the right hon. and learned member for Dublin UJniversity referred to, and observing that, unless the Bill sbould be put in the form in which the Irish Bill must be framed, there would be a differenoe be tweea the two tribuwals, he was desirous of having an oppor. tunity of pointing that out again in order to enlarge the number ol the judges by whom the court was to be con. stituted, and that was the whole of the proposition he had made to the committee. With reference to the statement that there was a blot in the Bill the right hon. gentleman was likewise wrong, for all hehad stadwas that, whereas the 39th section contained a provicon for the service of the petiton either within or without Her Majest's domrinons, he intended to make that more complee by a reference to certain statutes. Lord STANLEY observed that as something had been satd aboat the period of the session he wished to rtmind the committee that irrespective of any measure under con. ldderation there existed strong reasons in his mind why the sesson should not suffer an adjournment at the present period. This vas a time of emergency, and no one knew what news might Aive in a few days from an important part of the empire. (Hear, hear.) Therefore he thought it desirable that In this emergenc the repreeentatives of the people should be asembled at thior post assisting and supporting with all the authority and moral inguence they possessed the extive Go ment. (Hear, hea.) It had been said that because the prinaLo ot tl Bill had been carried the Govermuent might e contennt with hat success, tnd leave the conslderatioa of the detils till another session. But did those who had opposed the measure as being contrary to everv prinoiple of religion and morality, mean h say tit tay were preprei to enter into any understading that when she measure should be 'taken up in another session they would allow the principle to pss without any o ?tlon? (Hear.) Consistently with their views they cold not nd wouldnotadoptsulchx course. Theresultof theabandon. ment of the measure now would be that the time spent in Its discussion in that House and elsewhere wouldbe entirely thrown away (hear, hear)- and he would only observe that ifon the pert of those 'wo supportd the measure there had been an unwillingness to put themselves before the House, thatd arisen from the feeling which they entertained that the object of the Government. of the majority of the House, and of the publio, would be best promotd by listening patiently, and not occupying the publiC tie. (Heer. hear.) Mr. HENLEY did not think, after the speech of the Attorney-General, that their labours in discussng this Bill were lkely to be very ahort, because the hoa, and learned gentleman had statd with respect to avery important part of it, the conatitution of the oourts that in consequenoe of an acWdentsl*obervzt.ionmMdeby%l! right hon. an learned friend, the meumber for the University of Dablln, he found that it would be necesay to reconsder that portion of the Bill. It was imposdble to say what other incidental observations might be made whioh would render It neoessary to reconsider the constuction of other parts of the Bill over and over again. (Heir, ba"r.) The noble lord at thbe had of the Government stated that the BPII had receired the careful consideration of the Go- verunment; but Ifs it was astonishing that they lia eto eompe to a conclavion as to the constitution of -tii eou!t. lIe wa urprised at theg stioug language In which t!he At. htorey-Generalid ionidemned at portion oi the mtasiure, gr"1 ron which hd been adopSe for an ppeal to tJe arch. b lop in sue O%ae Mr. MASSEY sald the claue had been full disnmed In committee, and had been tanctioned by a demBive zmajority. n iahd thXe ttihltj of slbe9, hNe believed twoul ht bie altogther valeles, and be hoped the House wolna ot, 0witho2utU° noic f an motSon on the aubjec t, 11strieI u The SPEAlRER, having reminded the House tbat there was-no question before it, Mgr.

LONDON, WXDNESDAY, AUGUST 5, 1857. The House of Lords sat only for a short time last night, and adjourned after forwarding several Bills a stage. In the House of Commons, at the early sitting, after a short conversation, the Probates and Letters of Administration Bill was re-committed pro formd, when several new clauses were added to the Bill, and certain amendments were made therein, and the Bill was ordered to be reprinted. The Burial Acts Amendment Bil, as amended, was then considered, and received further amendments. In the course, of the dision of these aendments, Mr. Gnnsronse explained whiat had fallen from |im in the debate in the Committee, a misconstraction of vhich, lhe said, had given pain to the Bishop of ST. 3)AvuE'S. Jlr. blssey likewise explained, or rather restated, wLhat he bad said upon the eame occasion denying that he had misled the House or perverted facts, as allegedby the right rev. prelate, upon whose coure of proceeding, in relation to the Swansea case, he commented with some severity, insisting that, in withholding the rite of consecration for the reasons he had assigned, he had violated the laW. Mir. DnLwyx defended himself against an imHied chsge contained in the Bishop's letter, publsed in this journal, which, he aid, involved his character for veracity. The Summary Proceedings before Justices of the Peace Bill, the M£etropolitan Police Stations, &c., Bill, and the Boundaries of Bnxghs Extensi0n (Scotland) Bill passed through comlmittee. In the evening, the adjourned debate on the nomination of the Select Committee on the Oaths taken by Members was resumed, and ultimately the list proposed by Lord J. Russ= was assented to, the names of Sir F. Tn&sroza and Sir F. K.my being omitted at their own desire. Power was given to the Committee to send for personis, paperN aad records ; ninito be a quorui, On the order for going into oommittee upon t IL Divorce and Matrimonial Caue Bill, Mlr.

This doubt-i e thought, should be cleared up. Mr. Comrns opposed the Bil, as a pugnant to the general feeling of the coizr.;' o the opinion of Lord CAmaxU' , that maigbyte ,law of England was dissoluble, he opposed tat" of Lord Wxrsi8DALD, in its very teeth. Mr. BUrT observed that many'of the bojectWb urged against the BilL would be better reerved or the Committee. He, however, joined in diwauig the principle of the Bill, which he supported. UPon the question of morality, hq invited a compariasd betvween the morality of Italy, where marriage *w indissoluble and that of Scotlarid, where divorce was allowed. - Mr. GLADsToNs said, he conaidered the 48enion of the House one which, howeverhe-lamentilaiOt,e tas bound to tespect; hethereforeconfinedhioWf to certain explanations, personal, and -in rdetfts to historical facts in question between the A!otc xn-GzAnxA and himself. The atendment was negatived, and the Hog" went into committee on the Bill. IThe name of the court was altered froras thle Cou of Marhiage and Divorce" to " the (ourt i Divorce and Matrimonial Causes ;" ma the proviso in the sixth clause, that no suit for jactitaWon of marriage shall be entertained, wa expunged . -The debate upon the 6th clause, which oocupied much time, brought into view the effec' of the Bill in relation to marriages and divorces in pa OfUe elpire other than England, to which t Bill in Itpon reaching the 8th clause the Chairman WA ordered to report progres The Insurance Compaies Bill was ommntted pro formd. *The Clerks of PottySessions (elsi jlitta withdrawn.

The motion was seconded by Mr. MAsLmm Mr. Coxr moved the adjournment of the debte and, after some discussion, this- motion Was agree( to.

Royal visits rank as phenomena with great meteors, comets, solar eclipses, and new jilainst. They are extraordinary events, and immedi4tely set even people not the least inclined to superstition thinking what they mean and what they point to. Not that there is any absolute reson why they should mean more that -what the simple fact convoys. For why should Kings aud Queena not see each other occasionally, just as comrnQu people do? It must be a refreshment to human nature sometimes to see an equal. Equahif is a change after perpetual superiority. Then, why canzt the Emperor Louis NAroLxox pay a visit to-Queen VICTORrA at Osborne to-day withogt having l eyes directed upon them, and every mind ack4d to devise a reason for it? The visit is understoo&t', be a strictly private one, such as any one person of rank might pay to another. Then whynotpassJt over, and say nothing about it I Thersais that we cannot regard any visit of Royalty as strictly private. Whatever may be said, we cannot but connect it with some public motive. We suppose that reference to public subjects will not be altogether siuppressed ia conversation. If it were to be, wvhy meet at all, for a suppressed subject, as everybody knows, stiffens a whole meeting, and converts intorcourse into estrangement I Beut, if public subjects are not tabooed, the natural inference is that the parties expect to agree fairly upon them, for they would not meet on purpose to quarreL We naSturally I give a public meaning, then, to this visit, however private it may profess to be, and this publiq.,ieaning places it within our jurisdiction. we cmot, moreover, afford inthia country to let Royal jouline0 pasn unnoticed, they are so much more rare and strange occurrences with usl the- they are with our neighbours. For the greater part of a whole century Royalty w quite stationary. in this couisn+, and we ldwnt to imagine that it could not move. The King.war fixed in the ground throughout the 'rei- "f IGEORGE lit. e and King EDWjn :ch et ere neither of them moveable. The firlt $to GzoRGEr were always going backwlaids wards from EnglanId to hnaover, but (Gxonaz IIL was never once abroad iu ihis lfie, his journeys lying between Wuindior, Sew, and Weymnuth, which latter town baa ehowz its gratitude for the Royal preference by tons~crating one whole down to an equestrian potrait of the Monarch, npon the old Saxon pideint of the Whitehorse-hill.

At this season of the year perishable artioles, if kept rather too long, are apt to become not only atale, but actually offensive. Such is the pre-taent phase of the exceedingly ephemeral, captious, 'nnd factious opposition to the Divorce and 1M{tinonial Causes BilL Mr. WAitnx took lit up last night, and we give Mr. GLADwroNn and his friends joy of the treatanent their canse received at the hands of the Ing,ezious novelist. This gentlemcan, like Mr. XALi.-2s, starts with demanding a whole Session ;and the restoration of his youthful powers for the Eproper examination of this Bill. -He has, never- l;heless, had time and strength enough to arrive at some strong conclusions. Marriage, he says, is indissoluble. This, he says; is the Jaw -of England.: Our hundreds oft Divorce Acts .1hape been " a barbarous usage," imported into this cointry, we preaume, with that other ?barbarous system, Constitutional Government. VotwithstAnding the " usage," 'which Mr. VAnR.Ez -admits, these Divorce Acts have been national ins, and a base betrayal of truth and religion to the -tonvience of a comparatively few rich persons. I1r. WA-rL.E takes his stand on the New Testaanent. To a corrupted age, six generations -deep in foul national sins, he proclaims that he is a consistent Christian, and that he recog.mizes no moral principle which is not founded on *ihe Gospel. Mr. WARREN declares himself not -nly a moralist and a Christian, but a divine and -a scholar. As he will do nothing that he does not fini in the New Testament, he very properly idevotes himself to the study and understanding -of that volume. The result of his piety anad zsingle-mindedness, his learning and diligence, is that marriage is indissoluble; that laws professing to dissolve it are inoperative mud sacrilegious; hat Queen VicToBAr, the Lords, and the Comsnons, about half-a-dozen times a-year perform a Ibasphemous and sacrilegious fArce, pretending to 'disunite those who must ever be one, con.rary to the law of England, in the face .of the Bible, in contempt of the A£wGrnTY, znd in disregard of Mr. SAxuwn WaRREN. We would not, however, do an injustice evea to Mr. SAmUEu WARnnE. He does not place such sabsolute confidence in his own knowledge of the Aaw, his own acholarship, his own moral sense andc -theological acumen, but that he is ready to appeal 3;o " the Teachers of our Church." The learned and *ubtle Doctors of the Anglican Communionto whom this title is given are the nine thousand clergy -who, by means of railways and the penny post, by; -irculars and central agitations, by much uwe of Jlorseflesh and shoeleather, and no doubt at a great cost of other animal substances in this very ihot weather, have been induced to sign a Deelaratlon composed by some ingenious politician for the express purpose of mystifying and committing them out of their depth. Mr. WAinEr quotes the doeument in ex^io to prove that - these nine thousand Teachers of thd Chuxrch all hold marriage to be indissoluble, and appeals to us whether it is possible to fight against suvh a, cloud of authorities. It so happens, however, that the rev. Secretary of the Declaration, the man employed by its framers to. push it about, receive signatures, explain it, and mediate between the higher and lower intelligences employed upon it, has written to us most indignantly repudiating the very construction put upon it by 3Ir. WAanEN, the very doctrine for which he cites the nine thousand. This gentleman says that the " Declaration" does not declare marriage to be indissoluble. He and Mr. WAuRXm must settle that matter between them, for "Who shall deoide when " doctors disagree g" We confess ourselves unable to fathom the roguery of a document which we believe to be simply a political demonstration, and very much of a piece with the opinion which Mr. W.Amu ascribes to Dr. P=niropn-viz., that "he thought it ought to be the principle of the "law that marriage, was indissoluble." If this means anything at all, it means that for our worldly convenience we ought to declareo that to be an obligation which is not an obligation,-the very practice most emphatically and terribly denounced throughout the New Testament,-the very burden, so to speak, of the Evangelic and Apostolic dicourses. For our part, we do not pretend to improve much on the morality of the New Testametat. We leave that to Dr. Pxu&xoRx, Mr. SArum WAnn, and the nine thousand Teachers of the Church. We need scarcely say we have no great respect for the intelligence, scholarship, or even the candour of these nine thousand, in any high sense of that word. But we will say why. What they deprecate is the creation of tt facilities" for divorce, "unauthorized by Holy Scripture and by the "law and ritual of the Church." Now, the only "fabilities" threatened are the substitution of judicial for Parliamentary procedure ; that is, of judges sitting in a room on the West side of Westminster Hall for the very same men, probably, sitting in a room on the East side of the same Hall, in both cases- proceeding on the very same principles, maxiims, and precedents. These are the "facili" ties," very awful, no doubt, but not of a nature to be found particularly desribed either in Holy Scripture or in the law and ritual of the United Chuirch. In fact, it is as unreasonable to xequire that the neasure under discussion should be found in the Bible or Prayer-book as that the Victoria Tower, or Big Ben, or the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms, or the Standing Orders upon Railway Bills should be found in those documents. So. much for the sense displayed in this Declaration. Next for its scholarshi . The second clause begins :-" Remembering, also, "that it is declared in the Word of GOD that "marriage with a divorced woman is adulterous." We beg to asure the nine thousand clergymen that what they are pleased to remember so positively and distinctly is a downright 'untruth. It is nowhere, dedared in the Word of GoD that marriage with a divorced woman is adulterous. What is declared is simple enough, and appeals, like all the morality in Scripture, to ordinary good sense and good feeling. It is, that whoever married the woman who had been put away wantonly and causelessly, with a bit of paper in her hand, containing a form of words and a text or two declaring that she was at liberty, did virtually commit adultery. AUl the passages refer to one particular practice, to one particular form, expressly described and indicated by the words " put away," -as much a particular form as that by which the Jews were in the habit of avoiding their filiaL obligations on a pretended devotion of their wealth to the Temple. The term which these gentlemen have translated " a divorced w woman," as if it meant any woman divorced under any circumstances, does not mean that, and it is a gross misrepresentation to say that it does. It: means a woman put away in one. particular form' and manner, thk much in vogue, and resting on: one of the *4d,tions or abusive interpret.tions of the law. If the Bill did really affect the clergy-if it really altered their position with regard to the marriage of divorced persons, it would be time to consider their claim to relief. But the fact is that every year several couples of divorced persons are launched on society to be re-married by somebody or other. They might fall to the lot of any clergyman, yet it so happens we never heard of any objection to perform the service, nor do we b-lieve such an objection has yet been shown. The clergy are only too desirous to marry as many as they can, without any inquiry at all, and taking the word of the people themselves that there iz no obstaGle to their union. There are numerous Acts of Parliament aecuring to partioular churches the marriages of large districts, like the old monopolies compelling people to take their corn to one particular mill, and the result is that in the metropolis, and in many large towns, scores of couples are married at once, all equally and utterly unknown to the officiating minister. The grievance, then,as far as we see, is not at all likely to be felt, even if each clergyman's chance of having such a marriage as that under question should be somewhat increased. Were the grievance real, and were the clergy now called on to do what they might not have been called on to do before, there might be: a clause for the' benefit of those who have taken orders on a different understanding. Of course, all who may henceforth become candidates for ordination will do so with their eyes open, and be prepared to obey the law. The existing clergy, on the proof of a real grievance, might be permitted to make a formal protest before the first day of the operation of the new Act, and be allowed the benefit of that protest till, on further consideration, they saw reason to wvithdraw it. There are things to be said for and against such a provision, but. it would give no inconvenience, for there will always be clergymen ready to perform the ceremony, and it might dep'rive some wrongheads, or blunderheads, of a very foolish opportunity of making a disturbance.
Every new investigation into the sources of the London malaria only proves how ignorant we had previously been of the extent of the evil, and how little we had calculated the cost of a remedy. The later the inquiry, the worse are the revelations of impurity, and the more difficult seems to be the task 'of providing a corrective. In point.of fact, not only is the later investigation more complete, but also the filth of the town and its river becomes more abominable and less manageable. It will be remembered that when the Metropolitan Board of Works, after having in June of last year presented to Sir BMITAnw KAL' a plan for the discharge of the Aewage into the Thames within the district of the metropolis, subaeqently, towards the close of the year, so amended, their plan as to make the point of outfall a little lower down the river, and barely wit hoit the metropolis, the First Commigsioner of Work;s handed this proposal to three gentlemenCaptain DOUGLAs GCATox, Mr. JA=Es Ssxsox, and Mr. ThomAs E. BL&cwnLw,-who were to report on the practicability and efficacy of the scheme, to invite suggestions on all hands, and, if possible, to devise a more perfect measure. Having tiven to the subject the study of half-ayear, thes6 gentlemen have at last prepared their report, and in- our impression of Monday will be found a summary of the conclueions at which they have arrived. They report in emphatic terrm that the evil is even greater than had been imagined, *andthat the method of dealing with it proposea by Mr. 7 cAiar=TR, althouigh genqraUy correqt in principle, isrnot of sulfcient magnitAude. - e5 the variioU districts o- te nietropegi,= there are -numerous- villages and towns around Tond6n which disc1hirge' their sewage tlirough the marth :diaijns-..ito the river, and wlhich were not ;included in. the sewage- syvtem proposed by the Mhetropolitan Board of Works. In this way, and also through under-estimates . of another kind, the plan of the Board did not provide for the removal of a sufficient quantity of aewage from the districts hitherto drained by the Thames," and which exert such a universal influence on the river that the water all the way up to Kew is proved to contain almost the same amount of putrescent matter as 'at London-bridge itself, and very little less than at the Victoria Docks. While, too, the plim thus fails in completely draining the Thames valley of its refuse, it still more egregiously fails in proposing to discharge the aggregated filtn into the river in - the zeighbourhood of Erith,-a point which is bad for the double reason that it is too near to London, and that the force of the stream is there peeuliarly weak. Onx the other hand, Mr. BAZALrirs' plans of the high level and low level drains, together with his proposal to separate the rainfall when above a certain quantity from the sewage, meet with the approval of the inspecting engineers, and it is expectea that when carried out on a larger scale they 'wil leave the Thames perfectly pure. This modified approval of Mr. BA.zA.rrG's plan implies a rejeetien of every other. One scheme which some practical men put forward as'a rough and ready expedient was, that the sewage of each house should be collected in cewspools, br moveable receptacles of various contrivance, the ordinary drains being reserved solely for rainfall. It was, of course, a proposal that could not be entertained, the whole system of cesspools being objectionablo in itself, putting out of account that only a few'years ago a very large proportion of the househblders of London were compelled by legislative enactment to incur great inconvenience and expense (the report says from 61. to 201. per house and upwards) in doing away with these nuisances. A more important suggestion was, that the metropolis should be divided into districts, that each district should have a reservoir, and that there the sewage should be deodorized and converted into manure. What adds force to this suggestion is, that the fertilizing agents which pus through the London drains are, as maure, -worth annually more than 1,000,0001. Although from this point of view the scheme loolks very tempting, it is found in the present state of our knowledge to be impracticable. Deodorization would create a nuisance itself; it would cost almost as much as the -worth of the manure; after the manure had been manufactured it might not be suitable for the soil of the locality, and it is not likely that the demand for it would be constant throughout the year. In these circunatanceg it is not thought proper to recommend the utilization of our sewage to the Metropolitan Board of Worki, although it may atill be left open for private persons, under certain restrictions, to make what profit they can out of the proposal. If it be asked, where is the use of deodorization? why incur all the expense of it 7 r'why not run the sewage by conduits into the country ?-that plan also is inadmissible, " because it requires that " arrangements should* be' previously made with " persons who cultivate the soil, over -very large "areas, by which they must bind themselves to re"ceive large supplies of liquid sewage, and to apply "it to their land permanently, and with but little "possibility of intermission." The only other scheme which it is necessary to allude to is that of 3Mr. MAsnoAx, who proposed to collect die aewaage of the diitrict south of the Thames into awell at the -'oot of Southwark-bridge, to pump it I thence through conduit pipes laid under the' roadway of the bridge,- so as to unite' it with the sewage of the Nirthern district, and then to convey the united stream to a point on the Essex coast, where it will be discharged into the GGrmnan Ocean. It reemif that there is an engineering difficulty in this mode of dealing with the Southern sewage; that the point of outfall amid the aandbanks of t'e Essex coast is objectionable, and that compensation would have to be accorded for damage done to the oyster fisheries. There is, in fact, only one possible scheme-an amplification of Mlr. BAzAaiTTE's. The Conimissioners say truly that the only mode of estimating approximately the probable amount of sewage is to assume a certain quantity per head of the popuLation. They assume abpopulation of nearly 4,000,000 as .likely very soon to fill the valley of the Thames-a number considerably above the estimate of Mr. BAzAGE=. Their estimate also of the amount of sewage required for each individual of this population is beyond that of Mr. BAzGETxE. The latter assumes that the sewage to be removed for each person will amount to five cubic feet per -day--one half to flow off in six hours; the former maintain that seyen cubic feet per head is the amount for which provision should be made-| half this quantity to pass off' in eig hoirs. And, whereas the former was content to discharge the coDlected sewage at Erith, the engineers appointedl by Sir BEzrjA&smn; Hfj propose to convey it some 20 miles further down, to Mucking Lighthouse and Thames Haven, in Sea Reach, considerably below Gravesend, where the current of the river is unusually strong and the position of the banks is peculiarly favourable to the rapid progress of the sewage to the sea. Their mode of conveying this refuse to the outfall with the appropriate name of Mucking Lighthouse is not substantially different from that of Mr. BAzAGstrrs, but from the greater magnitude of the design the estimate is considerably incremed. The cost of the main outfall sewers is estimated at 3,144,3001.; that of the internal system of intercepting sewes in the metropolitan district at 2,292,9651., and the total cost at 5,437,2651. This is an enormous sum, but it will be paid for good work, for a most complete design, and for an object which is worth more than money can purchase. We have again and again had to say that the public will grudge no expense to have this great work of 'Purifaition thoroughly acoomplished. Of course, the Tdiles of the city will look sharply into the accounts, as in duty bound, but their constituents, the general public, in their desirg for clean water and pure air, have felt very much as DIVs4S in the place of his torture, when all his wealth I seemed to him as nothing in compaxison with one drop of the pure, cold liquid.

The Lalla Rookh took the midcbhanel while the Zouave took the northern shore to avoid the rnn of the tide, which was now against them, which turned out to the advantage of the latter, for sbe succeeded in overhauling her opponent on the ran down to Ryde.

This sort of " dodging," to ue a fAmmiiar phrase, continued as far as we could observe them with a glWs from Hyde pier, but it was impossibic to eaee thenoe how they romuded the mark-boat at the extreme eastern part of the course-the Nab ight.

That chance, it chance of msccess indeed it was tisot h"vgn, been taken by his pre4eessor, I cannot see anytbing to find fault with in Sir H. Barnard's conduct as far a the public are in a positiou to jadge of it. In his position, the failure of an asault might bo destruc. tion,Madprobably would be, at leaut, retreat. It zurst b4 rememnbered that his numbers do not permit the iiie of heavy columns of attack at various points, the formation of &neffeciivo reserve, or the leaving a large guard for his camp.; moreover, -he has still native troops with him. Rely onit, no relnforcements that he can get for a long time will counterbalance the increasing force of. the snutit meers opposed to him. Wehear of 3,000 ren encamped outside DelhL The dity is between them and danger, it is true. I plce no faith in the number given, but, supposing it correct, of what force inside the city do you estimate this m the exponent? I believe there is a hostile force encamped outside Delhi, and think it likely. that this force will graduAlly increase, and threaten our flank. General Barnard may get into Delhi in three ways- L By treachery. Considering the strong feeling of brotherhood animatlng the insurgents I don't hope much from this method, unlems the old feud between Hindoos and Musgulmans break out. 2. By atratgeig.m This method of conducting warlike operations is obsolete. I am bound to confess that, with the number of camp followers accompanying Indian armies, secresy, the soul of ruch enterprises, is very difficult. 3. By assault. That General Barnard is not in a position to take Delhi by regular siege is plain to a demonstration. He has but few Sappers, the bhlk of that oorps having mutinied, and to attempt trench work with so small an army, in the hottest time of the year, would be to throw half his men into hospital from fatigue. Tndeed, they are numerically unequal to the tisk of a siege. He may run up a few batteries, fAre away until be injures the works as muah as ho can, and then give the asault, which there seems an even chance would be successful, Bat the public must not be misled by the ridiculous story of Delbi being defended by a " churchyard wall only. The wall, a sabstantial one, cannot, I believe, be breached from a distance lower than 13 or 14 feet from its foot. However, with so much depending on success or fallure, wil Sir H. Barnard be justified in ordering the assault to be given ? Will he do it ? Such a plan of attack oould hve been carried out ineight dyays aseasily as it can be in 89 or 800. The trifling reinforcements at hand cannot have helped It on much. If Delhi hcas been takeen by this time, by whatever means, we shall have breathing time; but, unlegs taken soon af ter -the date of our lAtest news, I confess I don't see how Sir H. Barnard is to hold his ground. If he moves I conclude he 'will move tovwards 4As Reinforeements are pouring in; but from Caloatta to Dielhiis upwards of 900 miles, and wo must protedour oosling stations on the Ganges and our ane of communications generally, so that we cannot calculato on Sir H. Bsrnard's force being equal to the siege of Delhi before the seinforoements from Englaud reaob,him. For the suocessfal siege of Bhurtporo we had 30,000 men. For the siege of Mooltan -we required and had a force of *Regulars and Irregulars, including the Bhawulpore Contingent, of not less than from 15,000 Co 17,000 men. We tried to take it with a . larger and better equipped siege force than that with Sir. H. Barnard (f don't say it wors so good a fightingforce inthe.open plain), and failed. For the siege of Dolhi we ought to have 15,000 or 20,000 men. By the time a sufficlent proportion of Europeans can be collected we shall know what native troops can be trusted. Gholab Sing is dead, and his probable successor is believed to be-inimical to us Soindia has behaved admirably, but his troops, officered like our Irregulars, have mutinied. Hence there is fear that disaffection may spread further smong the latter. The hostility of native States, exoept that of the Kepaulese-and their power is much overrated, even if incurred-is not very terrible, although it would be sanoylngat the present time; and of similar character is the trouble before us of patting down the hordes of plunderers that ill traverse the country. Last of all, troops will, under excitement, stand severe fatigue and exposure to the mun and rain, but-not for ever. I do not protend to give an opinion whether Government which oertainly has done much, has or has not done all in Its power to meet the emergency. I merely say, if it has not done so already, pray let it be done now. Indeed, this danger, even as it stood when last mail was despatched, is no slight one. Having now detailed the weaknesses of our position, permit me to state some of the points on which we are strong. * Lord Canning seems quite equal to the emergency. In a distressingly trying position he has shone out brlliaiitlyi Sir Patricj Grant is a most able officer, fully oualified for his post Perhaps his servicesmaysti somehow beretainsd in tlie Bengal Presidency. It is evident the people of India ar well affected. They ought tobe so. As a mass they w assist us, passively, to the extent of their ability. Ma&dras and Bombay officers, aid others with Bombay experience, are confident in the loyalty of their troops. It their confidence is well grounded, the silly and unbrotherly exulting of some, profesing connexion with the latter Presidency, may well be pardoned. Regarding the eientual result of tho struggle and the slability of our Indian empire there cannot be the sightest shadow of doubt. The reinforcements sent seem quite suficientto insure these objects; I merely %rae that the derpatch. of the largest force possible will atta them sooner, cheaper, directly and Indirectly, and more satisfactorily beyond aUl relative proportion, than tht of a smaller une. If wre eaa do more, let us do it, and at one. I am. Sir. your moslt obedient servant, CFENURION. August a.

Mackay, the owner at the gangway, and conducted by them orer this noble clipper. Her Majesty personally exmned the dry and meat provisions supplied for the offieers and troops, and expressed her satisfaction at their exoellence. SMe afterwards aended to the poop and took a view of the great length of deck, thence desceuded to the troop deck and walked round it, perhaps the most wonderful and unxampled between-deck Her Majesty ever -vited, and which appeared to create her lively surprise. On ascending to th qusrter-deck Her Majesty thanked Captain wDenunell, who hd welcomed Her Majesty to the James Banes, and ldt in her yacht for Osborne at 7 p.m., cheeted by thou- s of her speople, afloat and onI shore.

The Colonel afterwards addressd the men in terms of encouragemeat, assuring them ho had muoh pleasure ad pride in presiding at the delivery of so powerful a weapon into their bands at such a moment, when a new field of contest had been forced on the British soldier. They were called upon at a short no. tice to proceed to China and ohastise the barbarian natives for aots of cruelty seldom recorded. That task was deputed principally to the Royal Marines, whose reputation, already so triumphant, he felt confident would be increased tenfold by the new expedition. He told them he had the fullest confidence in their tried courage, as he was well aquainted with the individul bravery of almost every man in the corps. The whole force was subsequently assembled on Wociwich-common and put through a course of battalion U.nd marching drills.

2he INDIA AfAILS %i4 MARSEILLBS. The Chamber of Conmmerce of Marseilles has addressed the following letter to Mr. Gregson, President of the Eat ludia Awoclation*- "Sir -The Chamber of Commerce of mrseilles ws natray much hoyed at the eomplaints in the EngllRs newspaper of the ege inthe trision th India mail vid Marselles It weare to believe an article in lAk lima, when the mall racs our port, instead of bein Immediately forwarded, it is kept until the nbxt usul mil tain starts, which eases a los of azirly a day. " The director of the Post-office whom we questloned re. specting this complaint pav us the followir explanation, wbich we loae no time In forwarding, and, w ch we hope will be satifactory. " The director hua thought It neary to give, fD;3t, table of the ordinar J.all tains (exress) "Thts, two mails leave Mase lres dal for Paris it connexio with the Northern. halway, woich takes the mails to England. "Their hours are ma follow:- "emMes ..Deptue . .110 0 3. l° 30 .. AMY I wn. 6 0;O P.. "paris *. p a { . : 0 &=. 7 3 p. { Ajisa .. S30pn. *. 2 33.ss. DepeAtze, ding to Ude. 30owr Arrv 7 30 D ., . 5 oa.m. "London Arval . U 0 p.m. 9 o em. "Of theso two malls, the first is dloUvered n London at 6 a.m. A difference of 12 hours in the oount!y (dancs I provinces) means from the date ot arfival a differeaze of four hours in the delivery. s' The aame may be sid for those localities which recelve two mails daily. It even happen--and it bha continualy bappened at Marseilles-that two mails arriving at an intezvalof 10 hours have been delivered together. The hour of departure of the regalar mail trains being well known. organized beforehand with '-lew to speed and prompt delivery, it is clear that whenever the Indi mail arrive in time to c^tch the ordiary manl expres It is the quickest conveyance. When the steamer arrives at an hour when the mmil cannot take advantage of the mai train,steps are taken to accelerate their transmisdo, whenever it car,be so managed as to procure an earliez deivery. " The morning mall reaches London in 37 hours, aud arrives there at night. If the steamer reaches Marseilles after 10 a.m., and before the departure of the ordinry train which leves at 12 40, a pecial train is sent to catch the mail train. This has always been done. Btt if the steArner arrives at 2 p.m.? the mnail Is kept till 10 p.m. for the 10 30 train. In fact6 it would be impossible for a spmcial train leaving four or five hours after the ordinary express to catch it in good time, ad the mails would have to wait at Calais just as long as theyw ould remain at Marseilles, as the boat would have left. Supposlng the mails were conveyed by special train to Calais by specist teamer from Calais to Dover, by specil train from Dover to London, they-woald not reach their destAnation-premising that the tol ph bad orderedall theline tobekeptclear-before4 300or .m It is true it would be in time for the first London delivery. For the short space of two hours, and by e±traordinay mens, the mall delayed four hours at its departure from Marseilles might be procured the benefit of a three hours' earher delivery in London. But should the result be six hours at Mrseilles, no advantage whatever would be a- Iquiredby employing special trins and speca steamers. The males would only reach London one hour before the ordlnaxy evening mnail. - The orgation of speclaltrains is, moreover, o difficult, owing to the cormphcate traffic upon the three lines of railway upon which the ails have to be conveyed, that unforeseen delays which may be experienced by a spoec train must be take into account. "By sending a speci train in time to oatch, if i e, the ordiary morning express, the French Post-ofie cdoes all that can be reasonaly expcted of, it, and whenL it allows the mnails which come by the steamers after noon to remain at Marseilles ti 10 p.m. it only makes a dif. ference of three hgurs in the time of arrival at their destination- and if it does soit is bec thetime of the dayat Lic tat ela taesplace may be consdeared as.- ummportant. But it even astiyes to obviate this delay as we have shown, for it employs spesial trains whenever there is a chance of smcoess. "It this explnation is exact as regards the mornig mail, might not the same measure be taken for the mails by the steamers tbat rve after 10 p.m. t To this question the director of the Postffice replies that within the limit of from thre to four hours, with special trains and special steamer, an attempt might be made to catch or follow close the ordinary evening mail train - but he adds, that the opportunity has not once pro- snelitself in the five Years tha an knglish xtemeor has arrived between the hours of mid=niht and 2 am. The usual entrance takes plaem at davb are, moreover, would be the advantage of a specia train ! There are more; didficties attached ts sending specia trains by night than in the day tine; it is -more difficult to keep the line clear; delays are maore inevitable. "Such are the involuntay caus which prevent a more speedy transmission of the India mnails, o"We h%vemiade you acquainted with the observatons ofthe director of the Post-office, with romnplete frank. ness; we need not add that we are quite willing to hear Yours, and that we will at once adopt any inmeasue you ay think advisable to acceloofh mxails.

MolvRy-MARK3TandOI2YINTEIJJGBNCE.g qTe quotation of gold at Paris is A=t Y pet stlle premium, sand the short exchange on London is 25.20 perIL sterling. On comparing theerates with the English Mint prioe of 31. 11s.. 10J p6r- 6-noa for standard gold it appears that gold is nearly 4-AOtb per cent, dearer m Pai th in London. B advice. from Hamburg the price of gold is 42 per mark, and theshort exchange on London is 13. per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint prioo is therefore rather more thau 2-10th, per oent. dearer in London than in Hmburg. The corse of exchange at 'New York on London for bill at 60 days' sight is 109i per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countrlee, shows that the exchange is slightly Iq favour of England. And, after malking alowano, for charges of transport and difference of interest the-present rate leaves a trifling, profit -on the importation of gold from the United States. The funds show increasing heavines. They opened this morning at a decline-of an eighth, and subeequently experienoed a further fail, closlng without the slightest sign of revival. The firi. transactions in Consols for money were at 90. whence they receded until there were ellers at 90k. A tempolary rally then occurredto 9k, but it war ,not mnaintained, and the final tranmstions were at 90k tot formoney, and 90s to i for the 9th of September. The announcement of the demand foe 6,000 more troops for India, and of the intended arrangements with regard to the militia, were the chief causes of the general depremion, but the operations in connexion with ,the approaching Eettlement likewise exercised an unfavourable Influenoe. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 217; Reduced, 0I to i; NowaThree per Vents., 909; India Stock, 214 to 216; India Bonds, 23. to ls discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. This being the 4th of the month, the demand for money both in the discount market and at the Bank was exceedingly great. In the Stock-Exchange the rate on Government seurities remdned at aboat 5i per cent. T he foreign stock-market has shown to-day rather more activity, but the prevailing anxiety prevents Eny permanent recovery. The only transaction in Turkish Six per CentL took place at a heavy fall; the guaranteed stock also declined. Ruwsian, on the other hand, exhibited a considerable improvement. BrailianFlour.and-a-.Half perCentsw were negotiated at 97j ; Chilian Three per Cents., 77; Mexican, 22k; and for the account, 22k; Russian Five per Cents., 111J and 112; ditto, Four-and-a-Half er Cents., 98 ; and for the account, 991i Spanish Ie ferred, for the account, 25; TurLksh ix per Cents., for the account, 94k; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the accout, 99k; and Dutch Four Iper Cent. Certificates, 98k and k. In the foreign exchanges there was a fair supply of bills, and in most eases the rates of last post wore fully maintained. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. for money, and 67f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. The Swiftaure has been announced from Australia with 85,538 ounces of gold, valued at 342,1521. Probably a considerable portion of this will go to thfie Bank, the demand for the continent having bean temporarily met by the .large arrivals yesterday and Saturday. The Bank of Amsterdam have to-day raised their rate of disount to 4 per cent. It had stood at 4 per cent, since the end of Miarch. The suspension was announced to-day of Messrs. Forster, Rutty, Hall, and Co., Scotch and Mauchester wareh on semen. Their liabilities are supposed to be rather considerable; probably over 50,0001.,aad an impremion seems to prevail that the liquidation will be very nnfavourable. Letters from Lisbon mention the capture of a set of coiners of English sovereigns and other foreiga piecea at Braga, about 30 miles from Oporto. The number of the party was seven, and among them was a priest. Another priest, who appears to have been the leader, bas escaped. The coining wa3 caried on in the house of one of the3e priests, and must have been conducted on a large scale, as five carts, each drawn by four oxen, were required to remove the implemerta and machinery after the seizure. Engliish sot'ereigns, which are current inPortugalat 4,Z00reii3 each, seem tr, have been the chief manufacture, but Spanish ounces and half-ounces of Charles IL were also found. The trade hars hitherto been conducted with impunity, but it is hoped that the present measure will be vigorously followed up, and that steps will be taken to detect and punish the forgers of Brazilian notes, regarding whom serious expostulations have lately been addressed to the Portuguese Government by the Brazilian hMinister. Thae Admiralty has issued a circular directing the commanders of Her Majesty's, ships, to mawke periodical returns of all merchant vessels, they may meet at sea, signalizing their names means of the new commercial code of signals authcrized by the Board of Trade. Ars every Brith registered vesel now has, and every foreign vemsel may have on application, a distinction signal of four flags, whereby her Dame, port, nation, tonnage, and other particulars are indicated, it is to be expected that the regulation will prove conducive to commerce by insuring more frequent and correct reports in the shipping lists. The four flags being distinguished by letters, this Information may be promptly communicated by electric telegraph, and when the Atlantic cable is laid we may anticipate ln Lloyd's lists the shipping intelligence from America as punctually as from the porta of the United Kingdom. At the first meeting of the londonDiscount Company to-day, Mr. W.Scholefield, X.P., in the chair, no dividend was declared, the net profit, 3,8321., being carried forward to the next account. The chairman observed that, notwithstanding the short period since the estblishment of the company, they have gained the confidence of the public, and he pointed out as a favourable feature in the accounts that no large sums are invested in buildings or other inconvertible securities. A proprietor remarked that the profits bave been incommensurate with the risk. He considered that the experiment of a Discount Company has been fairly tried and proved a failure, and moved an amendment to wind up the undertaking. A long and desuitory discussion followed, in the course of which it was stated that of the sum appearing on the credit side of the account for bills not matured 445,0001 has since been received, and that it is estimated not more than 1,7001. out of the total amount will be unpaid. The heavy Icss by bad debts was also the subject of much comment. Ultimately the amendment was negatived, and the report adopted by a large majority. The usual vote of thanks terminated the proceedings. Aunexeed is an abstract of the report and accounts:- "The drechtors avail themselves of the earliest opportunity of convening the ahareholders, and submittin to thom the result of the couipaay's operations for the finrt six months. The accounts, which have been prepared to theo30th of June, exhibit a net profit of 3,8321., ter providiag for bad nad doubtful debts This amount is carried to tho credit of the next half-yearly account, it being consldered premature to declare a dividend. Tho directors trust that the result of the first six months' transctions will not be regarded ns unsatisfactory, when it Is borne in mind that they have had to contend tot only against the ordinary difficulhes conaequent on the formation of a new oompauv, -diflicqlties inrersIed by recent disclosures affecting some loint-stock compiwiee,-but aLso.aainst ,a Engentxnmoiy. inauret, so trying to commercial credit. Thse havei duced the directors to restrict their operations, and thus to limit the amount discounted to the moderate su of 250M0,0001. The directors havo the satisfactionto snnounce tbOa connexions have been formed with upwards of 40 banks and roany commercial houses of high standing; and they confidently expect a steady ncrease in the company's business, whicb canmot fail to be remunerative. The directoTs recommend that the preliminary expens, the account of which is now closed, and which, it will be observed, have been kept at a vsry moderate amount, should be written off as early as possible. In conclusion, the dirtors wouid remind the shareholders that their staff is equal to the requirements of a more extended busines; the inflnence, therefore, of every shaeiholder is of importance, whether exercised in procuring deposits or increasing the number of discount accounts.

'The report stated that the direotors aze now in a position to lay betore the proprietors a final arngement in three areenents concluded by the company with fler Majesty's Seretary of State for the Coloniee, and confirmed by ordinanoes of the Governoor and Legi itive Council of Ceylon. It was only on the 6tb of July last that the contraet for the cqlitrution of the railwxy was finally accepted by the hipse Government, after a survey of the countrt made by Captain Moorsom, an experienced engineer recently sent out fog the purpoeo by Her Majesty's Secretay of State for the C4 onles. Captain Moorsom made a very favourable reporl to,the Ceylon Goverament. In accordanoe with a provsion of,tLe contract with the Government, the directors have p0A into the Bank of England 31,839!, to a Govermaent account, making, with 8,1601. allowed by the contract for preliminary expenses, 40,0001. a a first instalment of capitl beaing guranteed interest at the rate of 6 oer cent. per annum trom the 6th of July as regards th smm of 8,1601., and from the 1st of August as regards the renaider; * interest at the same rate will run on future inbtliments of capital from the dates of their 'eingpaid, as may be required, to the Government accounts, Mea. sures are being taken for organizing an engineering staff to proceed to Ceylon, and every effort wiU be made to send out the necessarynmaterials, and to push on the works asratpidly as possible. It is proposed that the board should consist, as at present (including the ex officio director, of mine directors. The frst vacancy which rnay occur should bereaeeredfortheordinary director whor the Ceylon Govern. rnent. wiU become entitled u nder the contract to nominate on acquiring saraes to the amount of 50,.000. A sum of 1,7291. has been received for interest on the deposits. The proprietors will probably wish that the interest which has been thus earned by the use of their money should be divided among them. It amounts to 9d., free from income-tax, on each regisered share, as a settlement for interest to the 1st of August. The statement of receipt and payments to the 6th of July showed t'lat 45,8591 had been received, and 8,1831. expended, leaving a balance of 37,6751. The liabilities of the company amounted to 1,892t, including 9851., solicitorfs bill, 5001. brokerage, and 4074 advances made by the directora. In reply to questions, it was stated that lrt. Strachey 'was appointed ex officio director by the Government, and tl*et on the Governrient of Ceylon subscribing 50,000!. towards the capital of the company they were to have power to elect one director at the board. Mr. G. W. Browne ws the Government auditor, and in his report sbtaed that he found the actual expenditure of the company had beeu 8,1601. Se. lOd.: a detailed account of the expenditure was made out from 1845 to the 6th of July last. There were items, such as 98i1. due to the solicitors, 5001. to the broker and 4071. advances by the directors, which required consider. ation. There were no iteram for directors' attendance, or for salaries, which he thought ought to have been included. After some observations from Mr. Franklyn, Mr. G. Smith, and other shareholders, a formal resolution approving the report and statemont of accounts was caried unanimaously. T'he CitAANcr stated that they had appointed Mr. C. H. Gregory consulting engipter, and that everything would be done EO as to proceed wdth the works as soon as poesible. The SEC r=nw then, read the heads of three agreements entered into with tho verntnent for making a raay from Colombo to Randy, it. Ceylon, the route to he selected by the local Government, the Crown lands to be given free to the company for the concession of 99 years. On obtaining possession of the land the company are to proceed with the railway. A Government engineer would be employed to inspect the line, and the Government may .eqrure the company to open the line ia section6. The first setion from Colemb to a station not beyond Amnbeposse is boe opened in three years, and the wholelinein fire yearsafter obtaining possession of the land, with power to tho Secretary of ;State for the Colonies to extend the period for opening It if be should think it necessay; the fares to be fixed by the Ceylon Government, so as rot to allow the profits to exceed 8 per cent. It Is also stipnlated that the post-office service should be performed by the raiwav company free of chage. The capital to be 800,0001, bat may be increasd to 1,200,0001., provided the line exceed 90 miles in length. A dividend of 6 per cent., payable half-yearly, is guannteed on a capital of 800,0001., including preliminary expenses, and 5 per cont. per annum on any sum beyond that aniornt up to 1.200,0001. ; the surplus revenue over 6 per cent. to be divided between the Ceylon Government and the company until aU advances by the Government in the shano of interest are repaid; the whole of the surplns would-then belong to the company. On giving up the line to the Government at the end of 99 years the latter are to pay the cOEpany tho value of the rolling stock. Powers are giv.n enabling the Government to purchase the rilway at the end of 25 years, and in case of default by the company the Government have power under the agreement to take possession of the line, and to convert the then paid-up capital into an annuity of 5 per cent. for 99 years. The supplemental sgreeeients postponed operations until the result of the Government survey was known, enabling the Ceylon Government to appoint a director on subsxcribing 50,000!. towards the undertaAking, and allowing the company 8,160!. for expenses, and a further sum for other items also in curred for law rand other ezxpenses.

LA W RkPOA7 . COURT OF CHANCERY. An- A CBILDnBS V. NHTTImq_ (Befora o LRDS J)JSTICRS OF APPzLL.) Ihe facts of this case were reported In 2'e Tim" of the 32*1 and 15th of July, and it will be recollected the questiox.was whether a coriteyance of lnd In tbe Bedford Levee, made by an owner to his son sea qualifica. tion for the latter becoming a bailiff or conservator in that corporation, and which q aillcation never wa obtbined by reMon of the death of the Son, coId hered b $h grimtor, or,in other -words, whether the settlor can call Ur,on the hesresat4law of the SOD to reconvey the land to bun. The V0ce-ChaicelUor Wood considered that the father, the settlor, had no equity to erforce such a course, and there. fore he dismissed a bill filed for that purpose. Their Lordships. however, unpo the evidence adduced since the case vis4 before the Vice-Chacellor, and believing that the father bad nzo intention to confer any beneficial intrest, and bad no intention to commit any unlawful act, vere of opinion that the plainEtif was entitled to relief, and made a decree accordingly. The Attorney-Gener;il Mr. Cairns, and Mr. Spencer Perceval were counsel for the plaintiff Mr. WiRlIok and Mr. Grenside supported the decree ot the Vice-Chancellor. M1C1rLRTBWAIT V. sXCKlsTaWAIT The chief questiou in this case was whether an avente of trees planled and left for ornaanent (planted about a mansiorn-house, and left standng after the mnansion-house had been pulled dowT) could be protected from being cut down byt e anA]t for Wie without impeachrent of waste. ViceChanoelor Wood considered that the case cauce within the authorities In this court regarding equitable waute, and refused to dissolve an injunction to restrain the cutting which hsd been granted by Vice-Chautcelor Kindersley. By fraDnement the cause was heard in this court on a motion for a decree. MUr. Cairns and Mt. lAwin were counsel for the plantiffMfr..Bedwell for isrtesin thesammeinterest; Mr.Alolt and Mr. G. M. Ciffard supported the appeal. Their LORDsHUs considered that, as all partiew to the dispute claimed under the scrne wil4 the acts of the testator maust be taken to have been done by him as absolute owner (so far as the rightsof the parties were conoerned), although, m point of fact, he was only tenant for life. They thought that the timber left standing on the Beeston estate when the testator pulled down the mansion-bouse did not come within the princmples of the court aa to timber of an ornamental character, there being no mansion standing to which they could be ornamental, and they were of opinion that there was no proof that the testator, when he pulled down the Beeston mansion-house, or at any time afterwards, had any intention to build another. The principles of eauitable waste, as laid down by Lords Bardwicke, Thurlow, Kenyon, and Eldon, could not be stretched so far as to reach such a case, and the plintiff's case wholly failed. The precise facts of the case wee fully stated in The Times of the 29th of July,7
I V[CR1E{CELLORS' OOURTS. A.t A wUruO V. SLATM I V(W*rC VtC eUhanCeUOr Sir x T. Ki;DERqTwv,-v -U , wasarguei on thte 2d and 6th of July las when judgrment was reserved. The facts appear fully iu the judg. 3nent. J. Glase and Mr. Miller appeared for the Plaintiff; Mr. Balley and Mfr. Xarsake for the defendmats, Air. SwanBton and Mr. De Gex for the trustees. The ViCnCi A-ciuoR now said that this was a bU filed by the plaintiff on bebalf of himself and all others the reditorsofJames Slater, except the defendaats, gainst fr. Slater and her twro sons William and Richard Slater, to set aside a settlement alleged to be voluntary, and dated the 18th of January, 1855, as void against creditors. AIrs SIsatr was entitled under tho will of her uncle, Mr. Boulton, dated in 182L to 2,0001,, which, by a fortunate invent. ment, became 3,0001. ; and tbat sarn was vested in trustees pon trust to pay this income to Mr Slater for life for her separte use, and after her decease to pay the principal to such of her children as should be then living, share and she alike, the issue of a deceaed child to stand in his dud. The 3,0001. was invested in two rnortgages, one for 1,8001., the other for 1,2001, The 1,8001 was pid off and James Slaser, being in business, wished to borrow 1,000l. of the trustees, which, under the trusts of the will, it n,ot being possible to do, it was arranged that the 1,0001. should be lent to the two Eons nominally. who shonld give security for it on their reversionary interest, and hand it over to their father. A deed was exemted dated the 13th of September, 1864, to carry out that arrange. ment, and it was recited that the 1,000L was oat of mone a belonging to the trustees on their joint acconnt, amd the psrties assigned their several interests to secure the repay. ment, including certain policies of assurance. There were also tusta in the event of repayment or default, treating theortage of 1,8001, as snbsisting, xnd there WAS a covenant by the father with the sons that Williaim Slater ahould a to the trustees the 1,000Z. and interest. On the face of thia transaction the 1,C001. appeared to belong to the trustees, but on the answer it was stated that it really was a part of the 3,0001., the reason probably being that it was not wished to show that the trustees were committing a breach of trust, James Slater then wished to borrow the remaining 8001., wbich was firt ohoeeted to, but it was ltimastely lent by a deed similar for all purposes to the former deed, and contemporaneously the deed rought to be set aside was executed, and to this Jaie SMatzr, the trustees, and Mrs. Slater only were partise, and not the soans. This deed recited the former deedb, the will of Boulton, and that James SIlter was entitled to certain property consisting of a policy of asswance and household goods specified; and it was agreed that, in consideration of M[rs. Slater's execoting the first deed, James Slater should assign such property to the true.ees on certain trusts for the benefit of Mrs. Slater and the two sons, in consideration of the promaises and for natural love and affection, and other good and iavable considerations. The question was whether this instrument came within the purview of the statute of Elizabeth, and was void as aginst creditors. It aspeared thatJames Slater died insolvent a rmonth after this deed was executed, and, altbough no doubt a moonth before he might have been rich, yet, upon the facts and evidence any jury would find that he was thet utterly insolvent, and therefore the property comprised in the deed was groperty 'which his cIrcumstances did not justify nu ia mak-ing a voluntary settlement of. frs. Slater stated in her answer that sbe was in the habit of lending money to her husband on his I 0 U, as much as 1,5001. on one occasion. That was a singular proceeding between husband and wife, and if such loans had been the consideration for the settlement it 'would not have been voluntazy, unless such loans had been repaid ; but no such thing was protended to have been in the minds of the parties. So far as Mrs. Slater and the sons did not suffer and were not perilled, it wasavoluntary settlement, but not other. wise, and they ayere entitled to have it stand as a securnty for the 1,0001., but beyond that itwas void asa gainst ore- dstOZ5. Iloth ps2ries being therefore wrong in their conten-r tion, there must ho no eosts e:cept to the trustees. ' (.Beeore TYice.G1,ceZ- Sir W. P. WOOD.) THIOMAS V. JInEINS. This was a motion for an injunction to restrain the deferdant, Thomas Judldkn, 'who carried on busineEs in Eleetsdreet, Londou, and in Corporation-street, Manchester, as a maker of and dealer in sewing machines, from manufacturing or selling sewing machines with certain specified mechaniial adaptations, or otherwise constructed or arranged in imitation or resenhblanoe of the machinery the subject of the plaintift's patent invention, or merely colourably different, and generally from counterfeiting, &e., the plaintiff's patent invention. The plaintiffs patent invention for sewing machines, which has been the subject of several motions latelyin this branch of the court, was communicated to him by an American named Howe, and patented in England by the plaintiff in 1846. The present bill alleged that the machine" manufactured and sold by the defendant were similar to sewing machines used by one Reynolds, a staymaker of Birmin'ham (against whom the plaintif had obtained a verdict i June last), and maznfactured by Grover, Baker, and Co. Mr. Rolt and r. Fooks appeared for the plaintiff. Mr. CAIRNS and Mr. PRTcDERGASsT, for the defendant, contended that the motionr ought to be dismissed on the grouni of leave and license from the plAintiff, whohad imself stted in 1S52 that he did not consider the defendant's sewing machines as any infringement of his patent. The VIcE-CPaLiCELLOR, though he could not grant the injonetion, thonght that the pahintiff was entitled to try his right at law. The motion would stand over, with liberty for the plaintiffto bring such action as he oight be advised, he undertaking to abide by the judgment in the action as the COurt should direct. S5'1Ths v. BRlOWN. Mrr. CAISNs} Mr. Gu'rPumn,nd Mr. W. P. MuIsRBAY n oved for an injunction on behalf of the plaintiff to restrai the publication of any copies of a hook called Contasseau's French-Eglis&e and EnyZish-Frcnch Dictionary, containing any matter copied, taken, or colourably altered from the books called lpUrs' General French and lngsh Dicomacry, and Spier? French &hool 1or eitber of suh books, and generally from pira!ing any of the matter therein contained. The plaitiff, Dr. Splers, Is au English bjeot resident in P'ris, where be holds the appointment of prcfeosor of Ecglish at ths Imeria Cone of Boaprute, aud also a t the Impe .al sol 4t Civi nters. .The defeAdants are Ruin Longman, the publisners, and XL Contauiean, who I professor of French at Ado.combe, and the author of the work soaght to be restralned. Dr. Spiers is the author of tree dictionaries-one a General glishFwrck Dictifmzry, iu which he does not claim copy, igtthavin. r been. fiBt pulbilhed in Fratncl; a Generca Frinch-Nngtsh Dictionary, in wlicb he claims copyright, as baving bteefLxst published in England grevousto pabHcatlon abroad. Tba wo-rk was printed in France, bt onterd at Stationers'.hall as an ingsh work on the .17th of may, and was also regitred ccording to the formalities of the French law In Parix on the 2Nth of May, 1849. The school dictionary referred to in the notice of motion is an abridgment of the other two, in which he also claSma copyright as having been first published in lingland in 1851 and duly registered, hut which latter work was also printed In France. Before going into the facts in suppork of the alleged pirac of the works in quetion a eptlirmufa objection was raised by the defendatstto the plaintiffs title ori the ground, first, that the work was a foreign work,r not composed, written, or printed in England, so s to entitle him to a copright withi the Act of the 5th and 6h of Victoria, ca. 45, secondly, that there could have been no legal pullication in England, as no printer's name appeared on tbe titlae-pge within the provisions of the2d of Victoria, Xcap. 12. This objection was arged befoer etering upon te merits. The ounmel for thi plaintiff eontended that as to the printer's name the statute the 2d Victoria, cap. 12 (for restraIning seditious publicagonsr), imposing penalties upon the publieatioilof works without the printer'snaine afied, had a territorial application only, and could not apply to a boot printed by aoreign printer. It,was Idle to suppoec that te nameof tEnglishipyiuter aust be affihedto every foreign book before it could be circulote a As to obtaining copyright in ths countn, the provifons of the Copyright Act, the 5th and 6th of Victoria cap. 45, had beeni cormplied, with, and it ocoud not be said t'hat foroa the mere clx, cunsatance of being printed in France, though distinctly shown to have benfi Arst published in this conntnribthe plaintiff's work had faile to obtain the, benefit of a mriltish copyrht. o hold otherwise would be to construe the it tutbe asafording Oa benefit and protection to printers aloe, t he lpeseof Authors.

Four children were the fruit of the union, of whom, however, only two,A a child of four years old and another of 1% monls were living. In January, 1855, Major and Ms. lAng left India and retured to this country, where they took Up their abode at Brigadon, the residence of Sir John Litter, in 4,evonshire. In the following December Ma'or LAna ob. Sained an appotntment in the Osmanli Ir and left Englad for Contantinople. While he was thus absent Lady Ittler detected her daughter in a clandestine corre. spondenoe with Mdajor Croker, of the 96th, who had beemn au aide-de-camp of Sir John, and also a psenger on board tbe Tudor, in which the lirgs had come to Europe. In the 3teantimeSir.John hedied; and LadyLittler, on discovering the intrlgue, diedherd ughter fromBrigadou, udwroto oat to Major Ling an countof what had taken pla Whn Idajor Ling returned to England he lost no timne in searching for evidence of bis wife's crmninAlity, and he at last traced the par;nours to lodgins Asopp zow, where they were living as Mr.and Mms. Thopso. A aetion for crim. con. was brought in the Couzt ofCo/mmon lPleas, in whioh Major Czoker pleaded leave aknd licensebnt the trial, whicausedh nu,Puad aenaan,tbticee eided in a verdict for 1,0001. A. motion for a new trial was t'hen made, but the rule was refused. Such was the case on behalf of the husbends. On the part of the wife a reertimmntory plea,a put In. It being alleged that Major Ling had misconducted himsf with one of the lady pasengers on board the Tador. XM. Ling further pleaded that the alleged misconduct had takent placo ding her confinement, which occurredduring the vroyage, and that shie had not become aware of the circum. stnces until after her arrival in England. Dr. J)XicXN an d SdMfDLZTON contended that the evidence 'a3 such as left no doubt with regard to the conduct of r ajorLing on hoard ihe Tudor, and tkhey urged that hie was therefore not entitled to a separationi Div. CunTBis and PrUamio=, on the otherhand, argued that what had occurred on the voyage was merely chacteristic of Indian manners; and that the familiarities complained of were not circumstances leading up to a tregauu hion of adultery, but were incidents sueh as mig t eas result from what Lord StowleU had termed the " misera\ble intimacy of sbipboard." Besides, there was evidence to sbow that the state of the lad's health was such during the whole time that a criminal intrigue with her on the paer of Major LIng would have been impossible. Wr. LDmHJGT0 said it was admitted that the adultery of M Ling had been moet distinctly proved; indeed, nothing coud hve been more vain than to attempt to m3intain the contrary * and not only had the adultery been established beyond a doubt, but a case of a more gross character had never stained the annals even of that court. With regard to the recrlminating plea, it must be admitted that the sort of conversation in which Major Ling was lleged to have been In the habit of indulging, and that certn versas which Ie had written, were very reprehensible. O doub if tbe evidence of the five witnees who had been examinre with regard to his conduct on board the Tudor were to be taken as in everv respect accurate, it would disclose a case of considerable suspicion against him; but it was perfeetly manifest that four of hese witnesses were speaking -to use the mildest expasion-under the inRiuinee of a very strong bias against him snd Tiey were therefore not impartial witnesses But wiiy had these witnesses not been produced at the triain theCourt of CommonrPeas? It ewas clear that if their evidenoe had been forthcoming, amd had been believed, It would have destroyed MAjor Ling's claim for damages; and the only inference the Court could draw from their non-production was that Major Croker's attorney could not depend upon those witnesses. Beides, urn. Linig bad till now never show thbe least suspicion of her husband. It was true she was confined in July, but the voyage lased till September, and she had therefore had ample opportunity of observing his condust. Women were generallyoquicksighted In such matters, and Mrs. Ling would not have b,een the less quick.sighted because all the parties were cooped up in a ship like the Tudor, In which tie conduct of every person might be minutely observed. BesidesaM. Ling hadatcallywrittentothelay in question to ask her to give evidence in the Common Pleas on behalf of *ajor Croker; and the asswer of that lady was to the effect th at if her husband did not object the would compl7 'w her wishes. The health of this lady moreover was proved to hAve been such that an intrigue with her would have been not indeed imrpossible, but In the highest decree improbavbe. under all the circumlstances of thev case, the Court ws atis. fied that no aduery on the p art of Major Linehad been established, and it would therefore pronounce fort te divorce, I op the prayer of that gentleman.

CI.VIL SIDE-(Before ae LOD CHM BAPor and a Common Jury.) GREEMWOOD V. nIOLE This vas an action upon a bill of exchange for 37t to recover the amount from tbo defendant as the acceptor. Mr. 1AWIinns was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. J. Drown appeared for the defendant. The plaintiff and the defendant in this action are both attorneys, the former carrying on his profeWsiou in Cbarles-street Cavendish-square, and the latter in Lincoln's.Inn.fielas but at the time the transaction took place he had offices in Clifford's-Jnn. It sppeared that in May, 1853, a person named William Hnudson Hnd., wbo vas an intimate friend of the plaintiff, broDght hbm the bil in question and asked him to discount it. he bill at this time bore the endorsement of Bind and that of another pereon, named Gibson, and the namne o the detfenant appeared upon it as the acceptor, and the plsAntiffl knOwing all the parties, agreed to discount the bill, whieb was at two months' date, and gave Rind a checlk for 35., deducting the remainder for discount. The bill was not paid when lt arrived at matnrity, and the plaintiff wrote two letters to the defendant upon the subject in May and JulY of the following year; but he did not answer them, and, according to the case for the lrosewtion the defendant could not be found until recently, when be recommenced practice, and the present action was then brought to recover the amounS of the bill in question. The defendant put a great m!an rt?as upon the record as an answer to the plaintiff'l claim, deny4 ing the endorsements and the acceptance, and also pleaded that the bill was paid before it arrived at maturity that it Was paid after maturity; that it bad been Paaid t b- hx and that the plaintiff had released him from liabil&y a tae accptor. Mr. Greenwood, the plaintiff, was examined, and he deposed to the circumstances under which h.e bifil1 hwA orignaly come into his bands, and also to his havg made applications to the defendant for payjment. It crose. exsmination he nid that b W an interview wlis the de-, fenimtmhotlyafter the bil became due, and tha h tl i t y en repied th'e maoey to Pay the bill, and he ait twastl he replie that if that were ao and Hind paid hi, it s ihred b*th denied mioat___tiey.. that Hind had'. pokzt of ispt paddjbiz,.

Near the place also were the marks of footete?g of %,very peculiar nature, with the Im. pressions of 22 nails, which corresponded exectly with those of a pair of shoes In the prisoner's possession, and, znore. over, the prisoner had been heard to threaten the murdered man, and say that he would ihoot him whenever an opportunity should offer. With respect to the other serious offences, there was one of arson, which differed from the usual circumsstances attendant on that crime, the charge being that the prisoner did lotIntend, to destroy he house, but set fire to some goods in his employer's warehouse with the view of defrauding an insuranoe company.

S]XooND "EDITION. THE fIMEsOFFICE, WIedLdj Ming. EXPRESS FROM PARIS, . The following is the letter of our Paris torre, Vpondent, dated yesterday (Tueaday), 6 p.m.:- , I nientioned a few days ago that the owueat'son so long in debate between Mexico and Jwi be discussed ia Paris between the Representatives of the mediating Powers and those tvwo Gofernments. It 'W originally intended that the seat of the debates Ihould be Tondon, but the French Govern3nent naanifestedo g 'eat a desire in favour of their owh capital that the British Oabinet yielded ihe point, It is true that India and Obisa are quite enough to occupy the attention of our Miniztes,for some time to come, and they will not perhiaps be sorry to hive one affair the less on their hands; but it may be doubted whether we are, not too mluch accustoming Europe to jee everY important concern debated and decided in IParis. The Russian peace negotiations, and the settlement of the quarrel between Switzerland and IPruiN, following ea4h other at so short an interval, 4ught to be sufficient for Gallie vanity. Be this a, it msy, it Is hoped that at all events the matter will be aetldL From 40,000 to 50,000 Americans were xeady to march into the IMexican territory as aunlares againt the Spaniards. I any diffculty on the mcore of nationality were raised they would have asumed the Mexican flag, and enrolled thsmaelves as Mexican itizens or soldiers. The Mexican Goverment seemed to have no objcction to a war with Spina. Advices from Madrid, of the 31st of JQly, state that M. Lafraga, the Mexican Eavoy, had proaeiited to the Spanish Government a nwcnaorandum justi8ing tlhe conduct of his Government in this question. The memorandum is the one I alluded to several days ago as about to be published by the Envoy. It cooprises the history of the negofiations from his arrival In Paris to the acceptance of the Anglo-French mediation. In the meantime it appears the Spanh CGovernment goes on with its militarv proparations as if no mediation was accepted. The effective strength of the army is expected soon to be 120,000 men, and there was a rurour in DMadrid that the Royal Guard, disembodied under the Regency of Espartero after the military insuIuection7''of 1841, would Eooii be reestablished. Madrid 'is, for the present, quiet. The press has really 'ceased to exist. No journal will now have the power, even if it had the courage, to allude to the acts of the Government, and during this moral darkness Ministers may do as thoy please. Housebreakers usually wait until every light is extinguished before they plunder our dwellings. Spain, I think, is fast hurrying on to absolutism or revolution, and Queen Isaiella is at lat beginning to be alarmed. For one reason or Other she sees that abe cannot resist the influence of those about her. lence her great desire for the presence of her mother in Madrid to serve as a counterpoise to the R;ing. Maria Christina has no 'wish that constitutional forms should be entirely destroyed in Spain. There is not one of the many constitutions which have shot up since the Estatukd of Martinez della Rosa in 1834 to the present day, that would not have sufficed, had it been respected for the well-being of the country; but unfortunately almost every party as it came to power paid little regard to IaW or constitution. The point in which the Queen has been hitherto inflexible is the restoration of the Carlist Princes. Matters may drag on as they are until the period of the Queen's confinement, but I should not be surprised if it were followed by events of importance. The Bengal mutiny is commnented on at much length by maot of the Paris 6iir&als, aadi's general their views and declarations are more favourable to t1he British cause than was at first the case. The Side, ever staunch to the English alliance, con. demus thae few French journals that have rejoiced over the dfficultties of England, or have ventured tc predict the deoline oi her power. The following i, an extract from that journal:- " The serious events which at present menace tho powve of Great Biltain have naturally communicated fresh ardomi to the eenhies of the English alliance. Certain joumraL, perceive danger for England in E-ypt, Persia, India, China Greece, Canads, and other countites, and, to judge fronl their conclusions, England's days are numbered, We can not for our pabt eo soon forget that our soldiers weal on their breasts, as a, mark of honour, the effigy oi Queen ViOtori. Were a revolt to burst out tomorros in Algerias,which God forbid, and we were to see th' lEnglish rejoice over that event and prognosticate ou ruin) we should assuredly treat them as bad allies; wR sbould point out to them the sacrifices made by Franze nt Inkermamt and elsewhere. But another reason oughi also to restrain the said journals from condemning the existence of England-namely, the simple fact that she is still upright and unhurt. We cannot lose sight of the history of our ally, formerly our gigantic foe-we cannot forget thcse wondetful strokes of fortune which her energy had prepared. We know the immensity of her resources - the struggles she hba formerly sustained-and, far from con' sidering present events as a blow, we look upon them as a warning, from which she will derive profit. England will learn (what the Crimean war and the contests v.th Persia and China have also taught her) that if commerce and finnces are powerful auxiliaries they must be supported by a military orpnintion based on equality. We ar, pesn-aded that the English will understand, and will impress that knowledge on their public men, that the time oa old traditions has pa3sed, as likewise that of * tortuous policy. A frank and decided policy is the Only one suitable to the present age. We are convinced that the English are well able to meet their present dangers, We have seen in China how they can strike when necessary, and certainly British patriotism will accomplish all that is required in India. Without aspiring to prophetic powers, we foresee that the first result of the Hindoo crisis will be the transfer cf the administration of India from the hands of the Com. pAny to thoso of the British Government. India will be. come an English colony.", The Gazette de France (Legitimist) expresses itself ia the followintg terms:- "The old syseem of colonization has crumbled to pieces, and England has a new world before her; it is on the manner that she will comprehend her task that deponds either a new lease of greatness or the ruain of her com. muerclal and political preponderance. This prediction is bh no Ineans exaerated. India bas formed the strength an4 power of England; and it is through that empire that sin exercises that undoubted 5upremaa in the world whico Russih now covets, and which formerly was exercised bj France. An attack on the Indian colonies is tantamount tc an attack on the mother country; aU political or mnilitary men who have Undertaken, or wished to undertake, a campaign against English inlfluece, have turned their eye, towards her Asiatic possesdion3, The projected expedition of Xapoleon to the banks of the Indias has not been forgotten antd we have rscontly soen Russia at work in the same Tegion. As regards the new organization of the army, the 'Company wiU experiene great and perhaps unconquerable difficulties. The system which onsisted in employing native forcefs s a powerful meass of defene is exploded for ever, -n the other hand, it is eqully impossible to confide the "tive service to Earopeantrops. Withaut etering deepe, Into this complisated question, England, we perceive, is engaged in one of the greatest tugges Bel has ever had to sustain, and on the restLt of 'wch depend icr fortune, her influgnce, and glory." The Unicers indulges in the foliewiag singnlar in,kmnuaxton - " It Is a matter of rsuprise that the majority af the conFoit of the ings who rule the petty States of India under tkb yroteotIon of the English Government give birth only toD 4a.ghters. IB this resrlt to be attributed to the Providence w'hich watches over the itterest of the Company, or are tbs aUidwives who deliver these queens bribed to subsa jut, f ale for made children?" Orders have been given to prepare the steam cutter Begeo for sea. She is to sail from Rochefort, and she is to replace the Dnroc, wrecked in the Indian Seas, The last pso iiita from aenegal announce that ievtral offae nd. sea,men serving in that coloay have been, ct off by feser. The Minister of Marine 1 ainstXucted the Governor not to make any { .rther expeditions into tihe interior during the hot weather. The Archbishop of Pars had a conference yeaterday with the Minister of Public instruction on the terms to be employed in the Imperial decree for re-establishing the Grand Alnory, 'which is to appear on the 15th of August. The Ntenm cutter Requin mailed from MfarseiUes on Sunday lest for Ajaccic, in Corsica, having on board the remains of Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Canino. A steam corvette is about tobe built ia one of the French dockyards for. the Pope, to .be called the Sixtus Quintus. For the last two days the weather has beenriln tensely hot in Paris. Yesterday at 2 o'clock the thermometer (centigrade) was above 33 in the shade. The heat was still fiercer during the early part of this day. About half-past 2 the sky became covered with cloiud, and every one expected, and hoped, that a storm was coming on. It pased off, howover, after a few drops of rain, which were hardly per. ceptible. Nevertheless, a slight brteeze rose, and still continues, 'with the sky again, but only pltiAiy, overcast. The heat has diminished in some degree, and the atmosphere is more supportable. From various departments we have complaints of the long drought, and "1 Eain, rain " isthegenerml cry. There were two fixes yesterday in the neighbourhood of Paris, caused by the intense heat of the sun between 12 and 1 o'clock. The first took place on the glacis of the fortificationsi near Porte Maillot, where some hay ignited and was totally consumed. The second fire broke out in a stable attached to a large establishment near the fortifications. The straw outside the stable door blazed up as if a,iorch had been applied to it, and would have caused con_ siderable damage had not the neighbour afforded timely assistance and extinguished the fire. }hrgene Sue, the celebrated noveli%t,died two days ago at Annecy, in Savoy, where he had been residing for some years past.

The Imperial Cabinet is exessAively desirous that the proposed canal should be cut across the Isthnus of Suez, and the Minister of Finance so far forgot his Btatecraft at Trieste on thae 27th. of last month as publicly to declare that M.. Lesseps' plan woould be realized in spite of the opposition of the British Government, The official Wiener Zeiturg simply says, that at the opening of the Laibaci-Trieste Railroad, Baron Bruck requested the persons present to join himi in wishing success to M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the indefatigable champion of the plan for uniting the Mediterrasnean and Bed Seas by means of a canal; but the Ost. Deutsche Post learns from its Trieste correspondent that the words used by the Austrian statesman were- " We cannot allow the present day to pass without expressing our warmest wishes that a great idea-the catting a canal across the Isthmus of Suez-may be realized. The opposition of one single Government will neither suppress the idea nor prevent its realization, as we live in a time in which there is a fraternization among nations. It is the heatfelt 'wish of Austria, and particularly of the city of Trieste, that the enterprise of AL von Lesseps may be su,. cessfaL May the Assembly express its approval of the seatiments expiessedby its applause r" The Assembly did applaud loudly, and persons who were present assure me thatTthe indirect reply of the A:ustrian statesman to the speech made by Lord Palmerston on the Suez Canal question some days ago " gave general satisfaction." Men in office Mre at great pains to persuade me that a canal acros the isthmus of Suez would be of far greater advautage to England than to any other Power, but the probability is that Austria would profit'more by a water communication between the Mediterranean and Red Seas than any -other country. If the plan of M. Lesseps should ever be realized, aug. land would naturally be able to send troops to India with much greater facility than at present, but the Trieste Lloyd would soon have the greater part of the tradebetween Southern Asia and Europe inits hands. Baron Bruck would fain make a first-rate co0mnercial port at Trieste, and such it will assuredly becomne if ever M. de Lesseps' plan is carTied out. The Austrians profess to be astonished that British capitalists should decline to have anything to do with the Suez canal, although they find it perfectly -natural that they should refuse to invest their money ill Russian railroads. The journey between Vienna and Trieste-a distance of about 385 Englsh miles-is now accomplished in 16j hours. Some months ago you were informed that the all-powerful Ultramontane paxty was Teselved to de. prive the AustziaD press of the little freedom it enjoyed, and there is reason to believe that the faters which ate to be imposed on it are now being prepared. The matter is said to have been brought forward by the Minister of the Interior, at the instigation of the Archbishop of Vienna, and to have been warrly taken up by the majority of the Cabinet. According to report, the means proposed in Council for curbing the licence (?) of the press are the following:-1. The imposition of a stamp. 2. The withdrawal of the permission granted to the non-official papers to publish advertisements. 3. ln future no concession for a political paper to be granted to a person of the Hebrew faith. 4. The responsible editer of the paper to receive a so-called "vwarning"*'from the police at the demand of either of the Ministers. Naturally the independent mustrian press will cease to exist if the foregoing repressive measures are taken. In circles which are generally well-informed it is averred that Count Buol fuily approves the propositions made by Baron Bach, but it is difficult to believe that auch is the case, it being a notorious fact that he would not have been able to maintain his positon during the war if he had not had the support of the whole of the independent press. There is no longer any question of the publicetion of the statutes for the representationof Rungary,auditisprobablethatthQo for the other Crown lands will also be shelved. As a matter of course, tho Lombards and Venetians will have their Central and Provincial Congregations as long as they remain quiet, and do as they are bid. No fact of importance has occurred recently, but there are several indications thxt the yeins of Govern ment will soon be drawn as tight s4 they were 10 Y ears ago. The progress made by the Ultramontsnisfs at once alarms the nation and excimc its indig, xatiousz - that the Btate of public feeling is less satisfactory than could be wis'hed. The ViIaters returned in the evening of th 30th of July from Trieste, but much later than wai expected, the train in which they were travelling baving got off the rils at Ober-Lcsee,s a plcee at no great distance from Adelaberg, in Carniola. TheEmperor, who returned from Trieste on Tuesday, the 28th of July, will re-commence his interrupted |auungarian tour on the 8th inst. The Engpress will remain in the Castle of Laxenbnrg during the ab-. sence of His Majesty. Mashal Radetzky is much better. It may be observed that the surgeons a | the Vienna hospitals are inclined to believe that the thigh-bone of the veteran isnot broken. The f**loWing . .r .'tio~w AVGUsT 2, lThe following information wA forwarded at noon by electric telegiaph - "IL Do Thonvenel has received orders to break off biB Idiplomatio relations wit% the Porte- if the Moldavian elec. tions ara not declared null and void." The foregoing news probably took your rcader, by aurprse, but those persons who are awat-e ot wha-t has recently been doing at Coustantinople in the matter of the re-organization of the Danublan l?rincipalities are not astoniahed that the French . Government has taken offetice at the beoaviourof the anti-Unionists- Some time since the French Cabinet expressed its disapproval of the policy of Prince *Vogorides, and piainy hinted to the Porte that it would do well to remove him fror his post. The Sultan7s Ministers, however, displayed more courage than usual, and, instead of censuing or recalling the Kaimakan of Moldavia, expresed their approval of his various measams. For some time after this slight diplomatic check M. de Thonvenel remained pasive; but as soon as he learnt that the elections in Moldavia were to take place onfthe 23d of July, he, is the naine of his Government, requested that they might be postponed. At firat the Porte declined to revoke the instructions which it had given to ita Kaimakan, but it eventually agreed to put off te elections for a fortnight, " if the French Government would consent that a Conference should be held at Constantinople between the representatives of the seven Powers, Turkey, England, France, Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia." The French Govenment declared that it was satisfied with the proposed delay, but declined to empower MI. de Thouvenel to meet his colleagues in conference. On learmnig that the Paris Cabinet had accepted the one condition, and rejected the other, the Porte was very wrath, and immediately ordered Prince Vogorides to proceed without delay to the election of the members of the Moldavian Divan ad Iwo. The Prince being nothing loth ta obey instructions, the elections were begn and ended on the 19th of July-that is, four days earlier than had been originally determined by the Porte. The other Powers which are in favour o^ the union of the Principalities share the indignation of France, and their diplomatic agents aver that the Turkish Government " would never have aced as it has done had it not been instigated by lIord Redcliffe and Baron Prokesch." As the foregoiug account of the quarrel betweea Frnce and the Porte is in substance correct, your readers will be enabled to judge whether the irstmentioned Power has been trbated with due courtesy. It is here rumoured that in the archives of more than one Foreign-offioe there is a Russian eircular, bearing date 1848, in which it is gaid that a union of Moldavia and Wallachia would be the beginning of the dissolution of the Turkish Empire. If the report be correct, how can the Pussian Government now profess to believe that the union of the two Principalities would strengthen rather than weaken'Turkey ? It is related that the British Cabinet has confidentially inquired of some of the continental Towers,whether they will permit their subjects to serve in the English army, but it is not known to me that any such question has been put to this Government. In general the Austrians take a very impartial view of the state of things in India. Although fully aware of what is passing in Bengal, they do not doubt that the energy of the British nation will enable it to overcome all difficulties. " It will probably cost a great deal of money and much blood before order is restored," says a veterau commander, " but England is not the Power to let any part of her possessions slip through her fingers." So many soldiers are now on furlough that it is imapossible even to guess at the strength of the Austrian army, but we learn by the Military Directory that it is commanded by 15,461 officors. UInder the command of the Emperor, as Generalissimo,are 21 archdakes, 5 dukes, 50 princes, 595 counts, 900 barons, 576 knights, 2,760 petty nobles, and 10,300 plebeians. The Oestereichisch Zeit1ng learns that Sir Henry.Bulwer has complained to his Xovernment " of the impetuous and injudicious conduct " of Lord Redcliffe, aud strongly advised it not to oppose the annulment of the Moldavian elections. General Sattler, who during the late -war was Purveyor-General to the Russian army, has just made some interesting communications to the Odessa Messenger. During the whole of the year 1855 there were 300,000 Russian soldiers in the Crimea, with 100,000 horses. Towards the end of the war 132,000 waggons were employed in conveying the necessarv supplies to the army. The number of draught oxen in the Crimea at the time of the landing of the alies did not exceed 20,00. 100,003 men were before the fortress of Silistria in 1854, Riza Bey, the newly-appointed Turkish Minister, has passed through Poland, on his way to St. Petersburg. Tt was some years ago proposed I to establish a " medical academy" at Warsaw, but the idea met with so little favour in high official circles that the scientifie world was obliged to relinqnish [it. The whole affair was almost forgotten at Warsaw, but not at St. Petersburg, for on the 24th of July a telegraphic despatch was received to the effect that an acadeimy was to be founded at Warsaw " imaxediately." In the -akase of the Emperor it is said that the academy must be opened by the 1st of October, 1857. At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 31st of July Marshal Radetzky arrived at Muin. When the veteran was lifted into the carriage at 7 on the evening of the preceding day he was surrounded by a great crowd of people, who displayed the greatest sympathy for him. The Archdulke F0erdi- nand Maximilian and his bride, the Princess Char lotte of Belgium, ame expected to arrive here tomorrow. The harvest is so very plentiful in Austria in general, And in the Banat (Eastern Hungary) ia particular, that the " metzen" of Banat wheat was yesterday sold in the Vienna corn-market for 14s. 6d. At the end of July, 1856, the same quantity fetched 35s. ! ~~~~GREE3CE. In the capital of the kingdom of Greece it is related that Mr. Wyse, the British Miniater, is about to bo removed to Switzerland. The question of the succession to the throne of Greece is still inooted, although the Greek Government persists in saying that such is not the case. M. von Bloudeel, who was formerly Belgian Minister at Conatantinople, is now maldng a tour in the Archipelago.

He is not the firt person who hap done this, but '" position and character give weight to his statements which does not belong to tht'eriterswho have witten of late years on the subject, and have niadefree use of the name of this unhappy won=; and I anirduoed, therefore, to beg frona yo. thoaertioe of the following prticulars:_ X' lato. unale, Mr. William Brodie Gurney, shorthand writerto the Housesof Parl4ment,.wuA wei known nto aw circle of friend, and to aany of our leading publih nit,;Asn aoma of heArictstintegrity. HIurtyeU.%thc1,w"6 familiAr with him ean testify was perfScUy unfmpe&ch. able. To dreis upa story for affect, or to take a ide ani tupport it1by doubtful xtaxtemntei. was sa fotwgug to 4, character asrobbery ormaurder. Ihappenedto be spending an evening with him a yeau r two !ceore hi death, ad' he produced a little book of anecdotes and oovnrtlonsgln vwhich things worth remembering had been jotted dow for' his own use, or for those who might come after hiui'. think he firat.refrred to it tor the sake of a "nurkablo convcrsation about Dr. Dodd's executon; brLt uaving tl book in his hand, he sid, "Oh! here Is somethil4 that wrill interet you about Elsa Fenning. You havqn heard, I dr ay, that a person of that tame was executed for posoning (or attempting to poison I forget whjch) the family with whom she, lived as servant, aud that a good deal of popular feeling was excited on the subject, many persons being persuaded thst she was wrongfully convicted, bectuse she maintained her innocence In prison, and on her way to the scaffold" He then read the underwritten sttement. I dare say Eisa pennig wMI live inL history as one unrighteously doomed to death, notwvithstanding; and that writers who are very capriciouy tender of hntlifo fe stil rgue from her ce to their eonuludon, that polsoners should not be convicted ulnt some one sweas in the witnessbox that he saw the poison bought, mixed, -d given by thec 0ed p ; bt, at any rte, it is dedrable that the eandid and reasonable portion of the public, and especially men of infuence and authority lke the Dean-of Faculty, should know how the ese really Ntands,-namely, that BlizaFenning did confea her guot, I in prison to A minister of the Gospel, who visited her sa a friendE; though afterwards, when perons eame abot her who doubted her guilt ead gave her to naderstnd tht a reprieve might be boped for, she changed her tone,snd, lite Palmer and Patch and many others whose guilt no one doubts, went out of the world unconfessed. The extract which follows is copled verbatim fron, my uncle's note-book, and bas been supplied to ine by his sop, Mr. Joseph Gurney, the present ghortband.wter to the Houses of Parliamont " Doubts havig been on seeral ocoasons exprssed of th aunt Of ElUm Venning, I feed it mr duty to reoOrd the facts with referce to her cuae whh camne withia rry knowledge. " Feeling ma strongly as any out r do the objecton to the linw.- ton of death bys human tribu.na,i IX till feel tbat there i . buaioe due to prooecutoe who are bound oouucdentioagy to speak the trut,b ud to jurymnenm who are eworn to find a verdiit acordig to the clldeeoe, which in an-y instances bu been disregrded. "aHving hed from a rfriend that the muter amd mistress of EAlr renneg'erg e eteenmed hbzhly resptable and eonstctentlous, I was ga to fd that the dobt enter"ined refered rather to tMe qw: lion 'whether the evidence, whih bwsh circumstntal, establshead ber gailt. The iway And th juftes thought It did, and I believe thoe who wer Preeent At the trial pretty genemray remered. In a fes da,herweere.Ibheard thatherstrotg w erxtlousof innooeneeh% cretstedi a doubt, and that msny who vited ber felt a stroog inter,t in her cse, beliving her o be Innooent, and a Petition to the Xln;was en' In. The grounds of it 'were examined by the secretary of State, the attention of the leanedi Judge was died to the case, And, on his rePort that he felt no hesitation a to the peoprety of the erdiCet the law was directed to taLke itcourse, which jtdkl mm person retained theirdoubt. " Ebtly ar-or herexerutioa I heard thatthe Rev. J,Tmed Uto,14 a BaPtlsc lnsdte, preacinsg In Obnrchbree-t Black ,riAd, hod vited br while under antence of deatb, having bten requested todio Eo in oonsequenoe of her having,Wben yYoung, attended at hIs ehaDel whether with her famly or In the Sunday-school am not swre. f knesw him to be a very excelent man,-* anu of great kindness of heart; I felt satified that he woultdnot forU a more uafayo,rbl opii th- reecumatane cSued fer, and i Dook au opportuIt o- teeing him oentormnedmethat on hIsenteringtth cellrFeenlng, with great e arutetnes and tears exsimed that the wag Won cent of the crme imputed to her,-that it Wu a wad ge and so on. ThAt he replied, ' Eliz, I hate not ooene here to tslk to you aboct that. I do notmean to ak yow whether -yu wrergeitya of that crime or not. but I oome to yOu a a minister of Jeu t. h er g that you re Probably Try sbortlyabout to appear befove your Judge, to romind you that you aren inner, and that uniess those which So anre consious rou hare committed re repented of and Fardoa You can have no good hope for eternty.

Ie wad, I - wbha affected, onsidering the italottn of tbis pror rgil about to suffer, andI taked to her eSeneatly, SttreatlEg her to seek 2rer<T, nd avoldlnalosgther the subject ot ber envicelom. Before I h d dono se wa quite melted down, and then it SU cme out.' I said, 'Do youme that sbe confessed that crime? * Oh, Yes,' '0 d he, thueagano,yeaervethan Mice d. it waa.au es beght ober beaf the forgIsenes of a1 her slns, and ot that among the rest, and Ihoped at the time tt ehe had joned In that pramer. but I undetatand that after this abhe Atlll perelted in &==rtWg those 'whoviSted her of herinnooence. ' I have felt it importaUt to secUre a wide eirculation for this decisive refutation of a very current story, while the recent trial is fresh in men's minds. Circumstantce to which I need not refer, htve prevented an earler commnunication, butI hope you will stil think it deserving of the publicity which your columns alone can give it. The facts are important with reference to the criminal jurisprudence of the country. But, having got upon the subject of reprieves and oonfessions, I should like, if you will allow me, to go on and speak of the fearful mischief often done within the walls of prisons by those who profess themaelves the friends of doomed criInAls The questlonings which go on there, the repeated solicitations to confess, the importance attached to persevering denials of guilt, must necessarily have a blnding effect on those who are thus beset. Nunbers, I believe, will not confess just because so znuch is made of oonfession. "They want meto confes that they may feel secure in hanging me," is the naturl feelng at uch times. " The verdict does not satisfy them unless I admit its justice. I won't do that. If I deny my guit stoutly I Bhal perhaps be believed at last, and escape." Thus, during tho awful interval which in the murderer's brief peparation time for eternity he is blancing probabilities of escape, demeaning himself so *a to make a favourable im pression on bystanders, heaping up lies which, by poesiblity, he thinks may gain him long time for repentance hereafter,-doing nything, infact, butre d;ing his poeition and opening his ers to the godly counsel of those who desire to sava his soUalive, If a criminal wishes to confes thero Iis no hindrance in his way. The penitent, without compul- slon, will unlook the secrets of his heart to his spiritual adviser at any rate, and to the world at large I do notknowr that he is bound to proclaim his guilt. mposrtunity, o- the other band, will not wring out of the dogged malefactor what he is determined to eonceal and if he is to bo softened at all and brought to a better mind it mut be, not by repeating questions to which he has given one answer already, not by turning his thoughts back again to life and sggesting the hope that oft-repeated asse verations will stay the uplifted hand of jstice, but by going to work as good Mr. Upton did, speaking compassionately as a tinner to a fellow-sinner, of our common guilt and the common redemption, Appealing to the conscience, atating plainly that all transgressions secret and open must be repented of, and pointing to the Lamb of God whose blood cleansethfrom all sin, while to the impenitent and unbelieving, the hardened amd self-justifying, it is declared plainly that there remalneth only judgment without mercy, " It all came Out," says the narrator, when he thus addressed the poor girl, whomn he bad known In happier days. Alas I she had other advisern afterwards-persons who meant kindly, but who did hor fearful wrong. The confession was retractied Hope wan trong, doubtless, in that young bosom, and the efforts maldng on her behalf were sure to be reported to her. Between her ceU and the scaffold the ordlinary "stopped. her for a moment," ys the Annual egistr, " to ask her if in her last moments she had anything to communlcate ft (She had better, sarely, have been let alone; her tongue was not tied; Ahe could speak then, .a before, all she weaned to speak; who shall say that she might not hope, even then, that another lie might save her ? It did make her a heroine, and a supposed martyr with the populace.) " She paused a moment and sid, 'Before the just and Almighty God, ad by the faith of the Holy Sacrament I haVe taken, I am innocent of the offence with which I am charged.', By her own confesdion at another timeahe was amurdere; dying thus witha lie upon her lips, she was no penitent. My fear is that the time of probation ws lost, the faithful admoniton forgotten, the course of repentance arrested, and the soul retained inl the bondage of sin, because she was buoyed up with fale hopes, and her fatal gifts of youth and beauty, coupled with protestations of innocence, maade a party In her favour wtho hoped up to the last hour toestort a reprievefrom Govern- ment.

I meAnt to say that tims for consideration had been givesa to the ight rev. prelate, but that up to the preetnt vril0o.- Settlement of the question ha, to the beat of my bexit,, been effected. The following few facts, which I giv prlntipiUl frm memory, but which I beiove to be tiabshtily corre*, wlW show how far I was justified in maidng this statement. The Swanse parish bual grounds have been CIo. byOrder in Council since the tAof January laat, bywhiclv time a new cemetery had beet provided by the local busitR board and duly sanctloned by the Secretary of *ti for the Home Depatment.

It Wa tidthbA "the proposed arrantemet" resuired much jonsLderation, and the question was !idaina*.ely 'edif to the next monthly meetine.
