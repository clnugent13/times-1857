TUE WAR IN PERSIA. INDIA BOARD. MAY 13. (From the Londo= Gt:M of Fridav. Mav 15B Ã¯Â¿Â½zie 1ol0owIng despatches have beenreceived this day:- "iXUTESAT.Grn.rnAL 81R JAMES OUTRAM, KC.B., COasiuin }EXrEDIrcORARY FORCX 1N~ PXRSIA, TO EIIS EXCELLENCY IJEtTTNAYT.GESERAL SIR EL SOMERSET, K.C.B. AX.13 KH CO.MMhDES.XNC1IIEF, BoMr- -AY, ' . " Camp near Mohammerah, March 27, 1837. Sir,-I have the honour to report, for your Excellency's information, the successful result of the operations against Mohammerah. The Persian army evacuated their entrenched position and camp yesterday, about mid-day, leaving behind al their tents standing, with nearly the whole of their property, public and private, all their ammunition, and 17 guns. As far as I am able to learn, only five* guns and a portion of the personal effects of the Shahzadeh have been carried away. "12. It was my intention to have proceeded against this place immediately upon my return from the Borazjoon expedition last month; but owing to the non-arrival of the requisite reinforcements, caused by the tempestuous weather in the Gulf, together with unforeseen causes of delay, I was not able to leave Bushire until the 18th iust. In the meantime, however, I had despatched the transports into tihe Shat-ool-Arab, from Bushire, as the troops were embarked, so that, upon my arrival in the steamer Ferooz, no further delay occurred beyond what was necessarily caused by the tides, and by towing so many large vessels up the river. 3. For tobme months past the Persians had been strengthening their position at Mohammerah. Battericn had been erected of great strength, of solid earth, 20 feet thick, 18 feet high, with casemated embrasures, on the northern and southern points of tho banks of the Karoon and Shat-ool-Arab where the two rivers join. These, with other earthworks armed with heavy ordnance, commanded the entire passage of the latter river, and were so skilfully and judiciously placed, and so scientifically formed, as to sweep the whole stream to the extent of the range of the gums up and down the river and across the opposite shore; indeed, everything that science could suggest and labour accomplish in the time appeared to have been done by the exiemy to effectually prevent any vessel passing up the river above their position; the banks, for many miles, were covered by dense date groves, affording the most perfect cover for riflemen; and the opposite shore, being heutral territory (Turkish), was not available for the erection of counter batteries. "4. The accompanying rough sketch will, I fear, give your Excellency but a faint idea of the great strength of the Petsian position, and difficulty of successfully attacking them in it writhout very considerable loss. I could have landed my troops on the island of Abadan, which was strongly occupied by Persians; and there is no doubt that, after defeating them,. the southern battery eventualy would have fallen to us. But the several batteries on the northern bank of the Karoon commanded the entire southern bank, as well as the stream of the Shat-ool-Arab; and it would have been a serious and an extremely difficult operation to have crossed the rapid current of the Karoon in the face of the enemy had the means existed of doing so. But, until our small steamers and boats could round the southern point and join us, we should have been helpless. "6 . After mature deliberation I resolved to attack the enemy's batteries with the armed steamers and sloops of war, and so soon as the fire was nearly silenced to pa! up rapidly with the troops in small steamers towing beats, land the force two miles above the northern point, and immediately advance upon and attack the entrenched camp. "6. I have now the very great satisfaction of announcing to your Excellency the complete sue: cems of the first two operations; the third, to the regret of the army, being frustrated by the precipitate flight of the enemy. " 7. The Persian army, ascertained from credible report to amount to 13,000t men of all arms, with 30 gtns, was commanded by the Shahzada, Prince Khauler Mirza in person. The British force, under my command, composed as follows4, wastheutmost I deemed it prudent to withdraw from Bushire; but, with the aid of four armed steamers and two floops of war to effect my landing, I felt confident of success, although I anticipated some loss from what I learnt of the determination expressed by the enemy to oppose our further advance to the utmost of their power, and their extreme confidence of succeeding, as evinced by the fact of their having sent away their baggage cattle. " 8. On the 24th inst. the steamers, with transport ships in tow, moved up the river to within tbree miles of the Southern Battery, opposite the Arab village of Hurteh; but, as some of the large ships shoaled on the way and did not reach the rendezvous until after dark, I was obliged to defer the attack for another day. During the night a reconnoissance was made in a boat to ascertain the nature of the soil of an island west of, and immediately opposite, the Northern Battery, where I wished to erect a mortar battery; but, as it was found to be deep mud, I determined to place the mortars upon a raft. This was constructed the following day, under the superintendence of Captain Rennie, I.N., and being armed with two 8-inch and two 56-inch mortars, with a party of artillery under Captain Worgan, was towed by the steamer Comet, and moored in position close to the island during the night, unobserved by the enemy, who, from our preparations at the rendezvous, and their confidence as to the impossibility of any vessel being able to pass above their batteries, apparently expected we should land on the southern island (Abadan). The horses and guns of the artiLery, a portion of the cavalry, and the infantry, were trans-shipped into boats and small steamers during the day, in readiness for landing the following morning. "9. At break of day, on the 26th, the mortars opened their fire upon both the northern and southern batteries. The range of the 5i inch proved too short, but the 8-inch shells were very eÃ¯Â¿Â½icient, bursting immediately over and inside the enemy's works, while, from the position of the raft, but few of the Persian guns could be brought to bear upon the mortars At 7 o'clock the several vessels of war moved up into the positions allotted them by Commodore Young, and by 9 o'clock the fire of the heavy batteries was so reduced that the small steamers with boats in tow, and one large steamer (the Pottinger) towing the transport Golden Era, were able to pass up and land the troops abDve the northern battery without a single casualty among the troops, although they had to run the gauntlet of both gun and musket fire; two or three native followers only were killed in consequence of their unnecessarily exposing themselves. " 10. By half-past 1 o'clock the troopswere landed and formed, and advanced without delay through the date groves and across the plain, upon the entrenched camp of the enemy, who, without waiting for our approach, fled precipitately, after exploding their largest magazine, leaving, as I have before stated, their tents and baggage, public and private stores, with several magazines-of amralnition and 17 gun, behind. The want of cavalryÃ¯Â¿Â½ prevented my pursuing them as I could have wished; but I despatched a p arty of Scinde Irregular Eorse, under Captain Malcolm Green, to follow them up for some - atnqe.: m__ .. ...e. smsofierrported that he carae uipon their rear guatd, retiring in good order, but that the road in many places was strewed with property and equipments. The lose of the Persians has been estimated at 200 killed, among whom was an officer o)f rank and estimation, Brigadier Agha Jan Khan, iwho fell in the northern battery. " 11. I beg to annex a report received from Comsmiodore Young, with a copy of a letter I had pre'iously caused to be addressed to that officer, expsassing my entire satisfaction with the naval operatins; indeed, it was impossible for my instructionz to have been more ably or more successfully carried out, and the commodore, and every officer and rna under his command, have nobly earned my warmest thanks. From Commodore Young, ably seconded by Captain Rennie and the other officers of the fleet and masters of transports, I have throughout received every possible assistance. " 12. With t' e exception of the Artillery,with the mortar battery, under Captain Worgan, no portion of the military force was actively engaged with the enemy, beyond some European riflemen sent on the war vessels; but I am not the less indebted to aU for their exertions and zeal, and especially for the great order and despatch with which the landing of the troops was effected, under Brigadier-General Havelock, C.B. The highest spirit prevailed, and, had the large Persian army ouly waited our approach, out of the range of the ships' guns, I feel confident that it would have received a lasting lesson. " 13. From recent information I learn that the Persian force, in a very disorganized state, is still inL fuU retreat; and. I propose to despatch immediately up the Karoon, to Ahwaz. three small armed steamers, with 100 European infantry in each, for the purpose of making a remnnaissance, and, if practicable, effecting the destruction of the magazines at that place. " 14. I take this opportunity of recommending to your Excellency's notice Colonel Lugard, C.B., the chief, and the several officers of my general and personal staff, the brigadier-general, the brigadiers, anid their respective staff, as also the officers commanding the several regiments, batteries, and detachments of cavalry, and heads of departments, composing this force, upon whom much responsibility has devolved, and whose zeal and exertions throughout this expedition have been moat praiseworthy. " 15. To Captain Kemball, Bombay Artillery, Consul-General at Bagdad, I am much indebted for his very valuable assistance; also to Major Taylor, as wel as to Lords Dunkellin, Seymour, and Schomberg Kerr, who volunteered their services on my staff. "I have, &c., " J. OTTRAM, Lieutenant-General, " Commanding Expeditionary Force." The next despatch is from Acting-Commodore J. W. Young, I.N., commanding the Persian Gulf squadron, to Lieutenant-General Sir James Ouitram, dated H. C.S.F. Ferooz, off Mohammerah, March 27. This despatch describes the passage of the Indian naval squadron, under his command, up the river, and the attack on the forts, until the enemy were driven away, and we obtained posssession of the works and guns. In this engagement the only casualties sustained by the squadron amounted to five killed and 18 wounded. Special commendations are given by Commodore Young to the officers who assisted him. A despatch follows from Colonel E. Lugard, C.B., Chief of the Staff, to Commodore Young, dated Camp, near Mohamnmerab, March 27, expressive of tbehighapprobation of Lieutenant-General SirJames Outram at the service rendered by the Indian navy on the previous day in reducing the strong batteries which the enemy had erected on the Euphrates to defend their position at Mohammerah.

SOMERSET, K.C.B., KLH., COMMANDER-IN-CEIEF, BOImBAY. "Camp, Mohamimeraa, April 4. "Sir,-In my despatch, dated the 27th ult., I announced to your Excelleacy my intention of immediately despatching up the Karoon River, to Ahwa7, an armed flotilla, being the only means I had of effecting a distant reconnaissance, owing to the total want of baggage-cattle; but, as the steamers had to be coaled, and seven days' provisions for the troops put on%board, while all were busily engaged disembarking tents and stores from the transports, some little delay occurred; and it was not until the afternoon of the 29th that the party could be despatched. "' The flotilla I placed under the immediate command of Captain Rennie, Indian Navy, aided by Captain Kemball, polit ical agent in Turkish Arabia, who zealously undertook the political conduct of the expedition; Captain Hunt, 78th Highlanders, commanded my military detachment; and Captain Wray, Deputy Quartermaster-General; and Captain M. ereen, my military secretary, accompanied the expedition, for the purpose of reporting upon the country in this vicinity of Ahwaz. "My instructions to Captain Rennie were 'to steam up to Ahwaz, and act with discretion according to circumstances.' Should the Persian armv have arrived, and apparently be prepared to make a determined stand, the party was to return, after effecting the reconnaissance; but, in the event of the enemy having proceeded beyond Ahwaz, or if they continued their flight on seeing our steamers (as I fully expected they would, under the impression that the flotilla was the advance guard of the British army), it was my desire that the party should land and destroy the magazines and stores which the Pereians had collected. "By the annexed reports from Captains Rennie and Wray, which I have the honour to submit, your Excellency will learn how admirably my instructions have been carried out, and the complete success which has attended the energetic and ludicious measures adopted by all concerned; indeed, it irs impossible to calculate upon the advantages which must ensue from the successful result of this expedition, in the effect it will have upon the Arab tribes who in crowds -witnessed the extraordinary scene o a large army of 7,000 infantry, with five or six guns,t and a host of cavalry, precipitately retreating before a detachment of 300 British infantry, three small river steamers, and three gunboats. " I feel that I cannot sufficiently express to your Excellency the great obligation I am under to the several officers and men of the expedition. " Captain Rennie, Indian Navy, whose gallant conduct at the bombardlment of Mohammerah I so recently recorded, has again earned my highest praise and warmest thanks for the able manner in which he has conducted this expedition. " Captain Kemball, who on this as on every occasion of difficulty and danger upon which I have required his services has rendered me most valuable assistance, materially contributed to the success of the expedition by his counsel and energy. Great praise is also due to Captain Hunt, 78th Highlanders, who so successfully carried out the military operations; to Captain Wray, Deputy Quartermaster-General, and Captain 7. Green, mymilitary secretary, for the part they so ably performed, and to all the officers and men employed in the expedition. I have to thanlk them all, and beg to recommend those specially named to your Excellency's notice. " I have, &c., "J. OUTRAM, Lieutenant-General, " Commanding Expeditionary Force."

Thenextdespatch isfrom Captain Wray,tDeputyQuartermaster-General, P.F.F., to Colonel Lugard, 0.13., dated Camp, Mohammerab, April 6, which describes in more minute detail the operations against the enemy conducted by Captain Rennie. It states that the enemy retreated from a very strong position, to the number of 1,000 men, with a perfect swarm of Bukhitiaree horsemen and five or sx guns, before a body of 300 infantry. The following despatch from Captain Kemball completes the series:- " ' CAPTAIN A. B. CEgBArz, POLITCAL AGENT, TO LIEUTENANT-GExNRAL SIB JAMES OuTRAi, K.C.B. "M'ohamamerah, on board of the Hon. Company's ship Comet, April 4. '.A(Extract.) "I have much satisfaction in announcing to yoiu the complete success of the expedition, which left Mohammerah about mid-day on the 29th ult., under the command of Captain (Acting Commodore) Rennie, Indian Navy, and of which the political direction was committed tomy charge. " 'Aftr quitting Moohammerah, the first traces we discovered of the enemy were at a point about three' miles beyond Rawlali All ibn Jacoob, or 30 miles up the river, to wvhich our attention was attracted by the remains of fires, shreds of clothing, &c., indicating a recent bivouac. There we anchored for the night, a little before sunset. On landing, however, we failed to obtain the desired clue to the number of guns accompanying the retreating army. Either their stay on the spot had been verytemporary, or they had omitted to range their guns in line, and must have unhooked the horses in the order in which they advanced on the road. " 'Leaving Ismailiyeh at 5 a.m. (31st), we reached Qomarra about 3 p.m., without any incident worthy of notice bceyond the capture of a Persian straggler,* from whom, however, we failed to elicit any information whatever. This man, who, but for our timely arrival, must, Inevitably have perished, was received on board of the Comet,* and having been fed and supplied with provisions, was re-' leased at Oomarra. " ' At Oomarra we ascertained positively that the Pers'an army had Teached Ahwaz the previous morning, and that' the boat containing the disabled gun had fasedOomarrathe same day. It was likewise reported that',amediately on the receipt of intelligence of the fall orMohammerab, orders bad been given to Temove across the river the small force under the command of one of the Shabzadads sons, which formed the garison of Ahwaz, as well as to withdrawr the grain and provisions collected there. " ' Tims being thus of importance, the vessels resumed their progress towards Ahwaz, now distant only 15 miles, at 3 a.m. (Ap. 1). At 7 we first observed the enemy's' cavalry videttes (who retired at our aproach), stretchingalong the right bank; and, having made good our advance to within two and a-half miles of their position, we could clearly discern their battalions of infantry, with a larue body of horso on the right flank, crowning a low range of hills of sandstone formation which trended westward in a direction at right angles to the river. Here, in the view of the Persian foroe, we overtookthe boat carrying the disabled gunf-, and took possession. '- A Some time was now occu ied in reconnoitrip the country, as also in awaiting the return of spies f had despatched the previous evening to obtain information, and, there beimg reason to believe either that Ahwaz had been totally abandoned,+ or was so wealdy garrisoned as to be liable to a coup-e-main. an attack upon the town was speedily determined on. The details of the plan will doubtless be reported to you by the naval and military commnanders; but I may be permitted to observe that its adop-' tion fully justified the previous reputation of Captain Renme for daring and intrepidity, while the judicious disposition of the small force under the command of Captain Hunt, of Ber Majesty's 78th Highlanders, insured its successful execution. The gunboats having teken up the position assigned to them under the shelter of an island within range of the enemy's camp, the troops landed, and were formed up in a manner to assume the appearance of 1,500 men, rather than of 300, to which number they were in fact limited; and at the same time Captain Rennie proceeded in person in the Comet, Captain Selby commanding, to support the former, and as far as possible to cover the march of the latter. " ' As we advanced the last of the enemy's pickets were seen to retire on the main body. The battalions on the heights gradually disappeared, and one hour later, when the occupation of the town had been effected, we descried the whole Persian army, with their rear not 1,200 yards distant from Us, in full retreat on DizfuL. Among the wheeled vehicles the private carriage of the Shahzada was clearly discernible. I must not omit to mention that twice as the troops proceeded the enemy endeavoured to bring a gun to bear upon them, and as often the steady and accurate fire of the gunboats compelled him to relinquish the attempt. "t' On our approach to the townall anunber of the inhabitants came out to meet us, with proffers of entire submission and devotion to the British Government. I lost no time in allaying the alarm which so manifestly possessed them ; and the assurance I conveyed to them that, provided tEey would honestly disclose all property belonging to the Persians, their private dwelings should be respected, seemed to have the desired effect. As soon as leisure permitted they conducted us to the different stores of grain and flour, and further delivered up to us 230 sheep, some 50 mules, and 150 new stand of arms (in cases), which time had not been allowed the enemy to remove. The sheep, arms, and mules Captain Rennie caused to be shipped on board of the steamers, but the grain, after removing so much as was required for the subsistence of the animals en routc, and reserving two boat loads of wheat andbarley, there being no other means of conveyance available, for transmission to Mohanamarah, I distributed among the inhabitants of the town and the outside Arabs. "'While engaged in inspecting the stores of grain information was brought to me that several-stand of arms and a magaine of annmunition had been abandoned by the Persians on the ground they occupined. " 'Accordingly, a small detaAchment, under the superintendence of Miajor Wray and Captain Green, passed on to take po^^session; but, having been preceded by the Arabs, a whom from Ahwas we could observe covering the grounud inmediatelL'after the departure of the Persians. they were enabled to aisceml merely powvder strewedo-v-e-r t,h-e-gro,unu-d, port-fires, shot, shell, &c., and empty and broken cases, The whole were collected in a heap and set on flreÃ¯Â¿Â½ " I Situated as they were in a position remarkably strong by nature, the piecipitate retreat of the Persian aimy** before a mere handful 6f British troops, can only be ex- lained by the panioinspiredbythe defeat at Mohammerah, Cy their inability, from the -want of boats, to effect the passage of the river, by the bold front aEsumed by the exyedition, mad, finally, by the fact, which would have weighed probably with better troops than themselves, ignorant of our deficiency in field pins, that the occupation of Ahwaz enabled us to turn their flank, and thus effectually to rake their position. The advantages accruing to us cannot I think, be overrated. Already had they commenced to entrench themselves, and had made arrangements for the arrival of reinforcements, and for the supply of stores and provisions from Shuster and Dizful; as it is, the loss of their grain at Ahwaz, which in the interim would bave main, tained the army for 15 or 20 days, will not only occasion much loss and suffering on their retreat, but - Ienog eae morning no the 26th in8t. thr- eeaprnl n ateMiy largOvrye and Si mae xlSone pearU thb nortbern forts Ili the afternoonde one hery large an4 wo e ema explosion in Rhauler 4fhta's CImp.

EXBIBITION OF ART TREASURES AT MANCHBESTER. The comparatively large attendance of Thursday, referred to mnTheTimes of yesterday, has encouraged the executive committee to return to a publication of the numbers, amounting to a total of 7,330, of whom 3,835 were holders of season tickets, and 3,49 paid the half-crown entrance fee. Two carriages full of visitors from London were set down at the door of the Exhibition about 31-50 a.m., having travelled by the London and North-: Western train. They were able to spend five hours in the building, departing again at 5 p.m. for town,where they were to arive at 10-30 p.m. A great number of the visitors to the Art Treasures Palace avail themselves of the opportunity to visit the kindred institation in Peel-park, Salford, where the works of the local artists are exhibited. It has now transpired that Prince Albert, on arriving at the railway station in Manchester, after visiting the Exhibition of Locai Artists, expressed a desire to purchase a number of the works he had seen, and marked a list of five, on a hasty reference to the cataloue, as among the number that had more particZrly attracted his attention, desiring that they should be forwarded to Windsor, if obtainable. It was found, however, that all of them except one had been sold. This one, " The Cottage Rome," by Mr. J. V. Gibson, was the property of lMfr. Agnewv, a picture-dealer, from whom it has accordingly been purchased for his Royal Highness.
TEB FALL OF ROUSES IN TOTTENHAMCOURT-ROAD. - ------d Mr. G. S. Brett, Deputy-Coroner for West Middlesex, resumed the inquest yesterday, first at the Lord Wellington publiehoue, University-street, and then by adjournment at lAwon's-roomsi Upper Gower-street, on the bodies of Frederick Byng, Ann Driscoll, Richard Turner, John Garnett, and James Kivill, who were killed by the faling down of the houses Nose 146, 147, and 148 in Tottenhamicourt-road, on last Saturday morning. The inquiry is assuming a character of considerable public interest, and the attendance of persons connected with the building trade especially was very numerous. Since the jury last met Mr. Joseph Taylor, the son of Mr. Taylor the builder, has died in consequence of the injuries he received by the failing of the houses; the jury were, therefore, re-sworn for the purpose of extending the inaiy to the case of that unfortunate man. _'he Depouty-Coroner observed to the jury that their melancholy duty had been augmented since their lazt mecting by their having to view the body of another sufferer in consequence of this calamitous occurrence-that of Joseph Taylor, and ho then invited them to accompany him to dichBarge that necessary part of their duty. The jury accordingly went and viewed the body. On their return Mr. Robinson, barrister, stated that he appeared to represent Mr. Johnson (MIr. Hunter's, builder), and Mr. Redding (Mr. Hunter's surveyor), and also the representatives of James KivilL. Mr. G. W. F. Coolr, of the firm of Cook and Stevens, said, that he appeared on behalf of the representatives of Ann Drircoll, Richard Turner, and John Garnett. Emma Taylor was then called and examined.-She stated that she was the husband of Joseph Taylor, and resided at 19, Berkeley-street, Somers-town. She had seen the body of her husband at the hospital; he was 26 years of age, and by trade a carpenter, being employed by his father. She saw him at half-past 5 o'clock on Saturday morning quite well, and she next saw him at the hospital about 6 o'clock in theevening. HediedinthehospitaL Hedidnotmake any general statement to her as to what had happened, or wbat it was that led to the injury he had susained; bu; he said that he had some heavy pieces of timber fall upon him.

He said, ho lived in Kentish-town, and was a carpenter. He knew that the deceased was Mr. Taylor's son. Witness was in Mr. Johnson's employ, and was engaged at the works in Tottenham-court. road on Saturday last. It was on Mr. Hunter's premises. Se was there at the time the building fell, and was employed in putting in some joists in the warehouses belonging to Mr. Hunter. The witness proceededI said, I This is a very long breakfast-time," and no sooner hrd I said the words than one of Mr. Maple's men said, "The buildings are falling down." I was standing on the joist where afterwards the new building fell, where I was working. The new work on HuInter's premises fell downnafterwards. There was a man underneath. I could not see who he was, but I said, "For. God's sake keep quiet, and I will come to your assistance as soon as Ican,n which Idid. When Igot into the ruins about eeven minutes afterwards I saw three young men in their shirts belonging to Mr. Manle's estblishment. I again went into the roins, where there was a little boy. He lifted up his leg and said, "rove the timber fron my neckl" I did move tho timber from the bo's nreck and leg, and the lad then got up and ran cwye, and I have not seen.hinssinoe. :Wethen proceeded to getthe other bodies out. The witness having described tie finding of the bodies was then minutely examined as to his opinion of the cause of the acident. re said lhe did not mape any comtlaint of supposed danger. wedicalttestimony wsltheno iven as to the injuries received by the deceased Joseph Taylor. Mir. Henry Baker, district sCrveyor for St. Pancral, was then examined at great length as to the course Be had adopted in reg rd to the u oldings. It appeared that the witness had, in compliance with the Act, made a representathon to the Commissioners of Police respecting the dangerous state of the houses. M r. Reeve, surveyor to the Commissioners of Police, was nexte examined. He gave his opinion that MIr. Baker ought to have given a second notice to the commissioners when he sacw thEatt the works were carried on in a manner likely to incur danger. After Eome discussion on the interpretation to be pet upon various clauses of the act, Mlr. Robinson said, he had many scientific questions to asek the witnesses on which he wass not at prewent suficiently instrletd, and therefore he wrould suggest that the proceedinZs should bo adjourned. The inquiry was accordingly adjourned till Tuesday next.

MR. HEBNY LESLIES 0HOIR. iee progre of this chotal body is seady and certain, as was plainly eviNed last night at the first of a seies of three " atbecription concerts," which took place before a numerous audienoe,, Jn the Hanover-square IRoomus. Mr. Henry lesie is thoroughly oompetent for the task he haa undertaken-a tuik whrih oely & man cian could acompliLh in a satisfactory manner; and that, while oBtensibly an amateur, he is a muaici, in the fUllet acceptation of 'the term, is ampl proved by the compositions lie bag given to the puxblic. The slection o tradriga14put ongs, &c. , on the present occaion was extremy insereiting;the performance generally wa admiuable, and the succes commensurate withL its merits. The conoertbegat with Dr. Crofs anthem, "God is goneupW," the openingof which (althogh not,exactly a Plagiarism) can hiarl fult eonjureussa'reminiscence of the famous canon, "Non nobis Domine. It was extremely well given, and the subdued tone of the voices in the passage. "Siug'praLes to God," was the more entitled to eulogy on account of the perxct intonation by wheich it was accompanied The next piooe-"O hiUs,. 0 vaIes of plemaruxe-one of Mendelsssohon a must btautifal part songs was faultlessly rendered, and enoored with m miyNo thing couldc be more irreproachable than the gradations of tone throughout the whole of this. Equally good, in another style, was the same groat m%ste's igorous and charteriitic hunting song-" Now Morning advsucing"-in which the progress from soft to loud ("pi no to forte-to employ the reco nized phraseology) at te beginning of each stza, vwould have charmed any cultivated audience, independently of the strildng beauty of melody andharmony. Ben. nets plaintive "gFlow, 0 my tears"was another triumphant example of subdued singing; while nothing could be more spuited in its way than Converso's " When all alone, my pretty love,` which was encored. In listening to these ma al, so fresh, spontanAus, and rythmical, it waz diicult to believe tht nearly two centuries bad elapsed since they were writen,-aperiod, indeed, when music was literally in its croAdle. In the second part, F. Femings smooth but insiid setting of Horace's 22a ode-" Itger Gvite, aclerisque purus! -andKucken's "War Song," aperody on the Hunitsmalis Chorus in Der Frdeicr waere both capitally gie aud both enoDred, although the las, a,ey poor specimeneof local part-writing, was unwerthy ofa place in such a concert. The other choral ,pies wen Nsthercllft's comionpl-ac madrigal, "1Ye 1*ppj. happy shephera swains " tAr W.C.Maefarren!s clever pet song, " The Curfew" (Longfellow's words), composed exprensl for Mr. Ledlie's choir, and Pearssll's "I sw lovelyPil lying on lilie," one of its authog's happiesteffors. Two pieces by 3t3. RenryTlesie,were introdqced and reoived with e pAl favour, the duet for sopranos, "H ope's Adieu," ably sung by Misses Hemming and Wa (n which tbe omposerx predilection for Mendelssohn can scarcely escape remark), and the ingenious quartet-from the oratorio of Immanted-Z Ta}e heed, watc h, and pr-wbich was intruaed to Miss Heraming, Mrs. Dixos, Mx,-Arthur Coleridge, and the Rev. C. A. Wickes. 'The programmae was very agealy varied by some pianoforte muse, thLpianlst being Miss .arabella Goddard, wiose playing, exquiitely finished a usual, and distinguisbeda much for energy and exression as for refinement, caused thi greatest possible delight. The DAeces selected by iss Goddard were the variations fron Handel's Suite in E major (familialy lmownsas "Thermonious Blacksmith") and two of Professor Stern4le Bennetts most elegnf and masterly compositions foe; the pianoforte wsithou aecom Dauimenta--the romance eati eGeaevi6,lv, and the 2lomdo ?:aewole, one of the most graceful and charming movements in the modern repertory of the instrment. Both performancesecitedtbew mesanmifewtationsofapprov and the "HarmonioueBlackamAth" beinigloudlyenoored,was repeated with increased effect It was a great bon, on such an occasion, to ecape oneofthe so-called "brilliant fantsaiP upon operatic melodies; but Miss Goddard's predilection for genuine musio does not seem to be confined to her own " soir6ee" or to the concerts of our great clasical societies; it attends her everywhere. The whole concert ws directed by Mr. Henry lIslie (whe aocompanied his own compositions on the Pianoforte) vith the utmost abilty. The improvement of his ehoir was a subject of unanimous comment.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HaOUSE OF LORDS, FiiDAY, MAY 15. Their Lordships met at 5 o'clock. Lord DUNGANNON presented a petition from Arniagh *2or the discontinuance of the grant to the College of Illaynooth. THE WORKS IN ST. JAMES'S PARK. The Earl of MALIESBIURY said, in pursuance of the notice he had gtven, he rose to call the attention of the Government to the works now being carried on in St. James's Park, and to ask what were the objects and what would bo the probable exponse of those works. Any one of their lordehips who might have directed his attention to tfhe proceedings nolw going on there must have been convlnced that considerable expense would be incurred before gho works now in progresm were completed. For himself, ho had in vain attempted to discover how the benefits likely to result from those alterations could be at alu In proportion to tho money which thay would cost, He ought to tell such 'Of their lordships as were not aware of the facts that the pIee of ornamental water in St. James's Park, some 12 or 13 acres in extent, had been completely drained off, that the bottom of tho lake had been covered over with a trong concrete igx innhes thick, and that the result would be that in future the lako would be rendered considerably more shallow, or contain an average depth of wat-r of probably three or four feet. There were other Works going on besides, by which the water was to be Pumped up into the lake and carried over the whole of Its surace, and then away to the river. He had taken the IDpinion of a competent authority on the subject, and the result waS that he (the Earl of Malmesbury) eould not e3tisato the total expense of the works in question at less than 12,0001. or 14,0001. He was told that the advantages libely to accrue from the alterations now going on were three in )umber. He was informed, first of all, that the palaeo of Her Majesty would be rendered more healthy. He could only say that, living as he did in the immediato vicinity of St. James's Park, he had never observed any inconvenience arise from the state of the water in the lake, nor had he ever beard from any one else that any such inconvenience existed. He knew well that their lordships would only be too happy to eontribute by any means in their power to the health of the Royal family, but, thank Providence, their lordships had Dever heard of nny ill-health in the family of Her Maljesty. The second object was that very great convenience would accrue to skaters on the lake durmg hard winters. But he (the Earl of Malmesbury) thought that could be no very great desideradum, seeing that it was only about once in two years that any skating could be carried on in that parb of the metropolis for more than a week. The third point was that there should be a constant supply of water carried through the lake, the effect of which would be to render the water transparent, and, therefore, at once whole. some and ornamental. His impression, however, was that if by that expensive layer of concrete they prevsnted the natural percolation taking place through the mud and vege. tation that usually collected at the bottom of pleces of ornamental water, and which had the effect of purifying the water, instead of putting a stop to the inconvemence of which complaint was made, the result would be very much to increase it. He knew, at all events, from a noble friend of his who once filled the office of CommissIoner of Woods and Forests that that had been the effect of paving with bricks the bottom of the reservoir in the Green PArk. He had another, though it might beaminorobjeoion totheworksin progres Their lordships all knew tlhat however beautiful the pieee of ornamental water in St. James's Park was its attraction was very much enhanced by the waterfowl which lived upon it If a coUection o vwater fowl was in future to be maintained there the denartment of Public Works would have to employ people to feed them, now that all the aquatio vegetation which grew in the lake, and on which they mainly subsisted, had been cleared away and prevented from again accumulating. Again, he (the Earl of Malmesbury) had received letters from several ,of tne residents in the neighbourhood of Queen's-square and near St. James's Park, stating that the works now in proYgress in the park bad completely drained their wells and rendered them useless. He had also been Informed on competent authority that if the steam-engine now set up in the park was to be permanently maintained, rs he understood 2t was, to pump the water into tho lake and through it, the wells m the vicinity would be rendered entirely dry by the ,rocess and the inhabitants there greatly inconvenienced. rut he looked upon the works in question in a much more serious light. They were at best but a piece of fanciful extravagance on the part of the right hon. baronet now at the bead of the Department of Public Works (Sir B. Hall). Depend upon it, proud &Lwe were of this countrv, and convinced as we were that itAas all-powerful-he might almost say immortal-Parliament and the people at large must pay greater attention to the finances of the country than they had done, unless at some period, and probably not at all a remote, one, they were prepared to encounter evils such as they had not hitherto experienced. (Hear, hear.) lHe never saw a public document more likely to occasion well'grounded alarm to their lordships and the country than the return of the money expended in miscellaneous sevices from 1838 to 1856, recently laid upon the table of their lordsbips' House. It might, be said that the 12,0001. or 4,0001. about to be expended on this lake was nothiag to a country like this, but when they added to that a number of sums of smaller or greater magnitude, which made in the aggegate an enormous amount, he submitted It ,was not beneath the dignity of their lordships to take such a state of things into their consideration. Ha should like to know whether the right hon. baronet at the head of the Department of Public Words had received the permission of Parliament to Incur the expense consequent upon the works in question - whether, in fact, the money had been regularly voted by the House of Commons for the prpose. (Hear, hear.) He (the Earl of Malmesbury) held his hand the paper to which he had just referred, showing the great increase which had taken place in the miscellaneous estimates during the last 20 years. Comparing the year 183with 1856, the increase in the expenditure on public works had been in round numbers not lmp than 463,0001., the increase in salaries had been 824,0001., the increase in the expenditure in law and upon prisons, convicts, &c., amounted to 1,600,0001., the increase on science and education was 720,000&, and the Increase in votes for what rnight be called temporary objects was 324,0001. In other words, the total miscellaneous expenditure in 1838 was 2,500,0001., and in 1856 6,724,0001. showing an increase in 1856 as coipared with 1838 of no less than 4,224,0001. on miscellaneous estimates alone, or a sum very nearly equal to the amount raised by the first property tax. (Hear, hear.) Now, he wished to guard himself from being supposed to advocate any unnecessary reduction in the estimates for the army and navy. He was surprised to find a suspicion existing in some quarters where he lealt expected it that noble lords on his side of the House were anxious to cut down the expenditure for the effective services of the country. Hepepeated he was astonished to find such a suspicion entertained of men who were the first to dare, since the battle 6f Waterloo, to increase the. effective strength of the army and navy. (Hear, her.) He could only say, sO far as his humble opinion went, he should be sorry indeed ever to see the army and navy again reduced to the state in whiah they were when his party took office in 1852. (Hear, hear.) He looked back to that time with a keen recollection of the great alarm that he and they with whom he acted experienced lest an emergency should arise in -which those services, in the condition they then were, should be put to the test, and the thankfulness they felt that no such occasion arose at that period. He really believed that the Govern. ment, before entering upon the works in St. James's Park could acarcelv have counted the cost, so recklessly did the; seem to be proceeding - and with respect to other items of expenditure incurred by the department over which the right hon. baronet (Sir B. Hall) presided he (the Earl of blalmesbury) thought he could show that the people did not get anything like their money's worth. For example, he found a sum of 40,0001. expended in 1855 for buildings in Downing-street. 'He could not understand how such a sum could have been laid out, inasmuch as that part of the Government property seemed to be in the same state of ruin in which it had been for many years, Again, what sum did their lordships think had ben spent three years ago in cleaning the statue of Charles I. at Charingcross? Why, no less than 1,000!. (Loud cries of "Hear.") Then he came to the monument at Scutari, on which 17,000. had been expended. (Hear, hear.) The removal of the Science and Art Department last year cost 10, 0001.; and 4,W01. had been expended upon an entrance to St. James's Park, which had only the appearance of two yellow wals (Rear, hear.) He mnust repeat 'hat Parliament would not be dping its duty if it dicd not- he would not say oblige, huLt -assist the Governm.n,t in oA7. out .~o~e of ,taiot economy at this time. We had expended 76,000,0001. on the war; we had increased the public debt by 40,000,000. ; and we had a permanent charge of 1,500,000!. as interest on the debt, besides something like 2, 000,0001. to be paid annu. ally to a sinking fund for the purpose of extinguishing the debt. In the face of facts such as those he submitted it was not beneath the consideration of Parliament to enforce the strioteet economy in the public expenditure. 'Under a strong Government, as the present seemed to be, anything leextravagance was much more dangerous than it would be under aweak one. He could easily conceive the right hon. baronet at the head of the Department of Public Works desirous of distinguishing his tenure of office above that of all his predecessors. Nothing could well be more tempting than for a man to stand in the middle of thia suerropoiis and say he would convert it into a city of palaces. It was the more natural to indulge aspirations so brilliant when one represented one of the great electoral divisions of the capital of England. He (the Earl of Malreesbury) could fanoy such a man haviu befQre his eyes the glory of Florence and the lfedicis,ni especially of the great Lorenzo, and wishing afterwards to go down to posterity as Benjamin the Magnificent (laughter) - but he (the Earl of Malmesbury) thought the time had arrived when theirlordships ought to call upon the Government to impose some conditions on the amnbition of the right hon. baronet, and some limit to the extravagant expenditure of the public money to which he (the Earl of Malmesbury) had ventured to call the attention of the Houe. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANVILLE said he was not surprised that the noble earl should have thought it necessary to make the statement he had done, seeing he entertained the views he did upon the subject which he had brought under the consideration of their lordships. 3Ere was sure the House and the publio would willingly contribute to any public improvement demanded by Her Majesty's health. So far as he was aware, however, n6ither HEer Majesty nor any member of the Royal family had made any complaint on the subject, but he knew that the medical afficers of the disrict had made many formal and ofricial appllcations to tho Government to removo the abominable nuisance arising from the impure state of the water In the Royal parks for many years past. (Hear.) He had it, too, on tehighestprofeson4) AAto-ity tlft, bad a te wate Wu in the other parks, that of St, James's Park was in the worst State of alL Such appeals could not be neglected by any Government desirous to do its duty; and it became neces. sary to consider in what way the evil could be rectifed. The noble earl had complained of the irregularity on the part of the Goverment in proceeding with these works without first presenting an estimate to Parliament. (Hear, hear.) He was told that it was impoesible to frame an estimate of the expense necessary for clearing out the lake umtil the lake was first emptied. When it was emptied and the mud laid bare, it was not reasonable or desirable to defer the work of cleaning out the lake for a whole year. This wa3 the reason why no estimate had been presented last year for this purpose. When the lake was emptied it was found that the high water level was five feet lower than the Trinity datum, while such were the irregularities of the surface, there being in some places holes throe feet deep, and in other places holes of a depth of mine feat, that it was impossible to lelar out the lake unless arUificially, the inequalities of course adding to the stag. nancy of the water left. The noble earl declared that the linlngwith concrete would make matters vvorsethfan before, and he had instanced the experiment made by a late commissioner of works for the purification of the water of the Green Park. But the two cases were not similar. In the Green Park no eoncret was nsed. Bricks were there used without mortar, and the water used came from the Thames directly opposite a sewer, and brought up with it a smell that was anything but agreeable, and whieh was afterwards further improved by the dead cats, dead dogs, and he believed a dead human being, whichwere found in that receptacle close to Piccadilly. The noble earl had by no mesus proved that the measures now in progress would not succeed by citing an experiment of an opposite character. With regazd to the noble earl's regret at the absence of the waterfowl which were so ornamental a feature In St. James's Park, he was happyto inform him that theyhad been removed to Kew pending the alterations, and that they would come back when they were completed. He could not see why they should not in future prosper as much in fresh water as in the stinking and offensive water in which they had been wont to disport themselves. In future, when it was necessary to flush out the lake no expense would be incurred while at present an enormous expenso was unavoid. able when it was requisite to clean out the lake. The noble earl had objected to inourring expense for the sake of tbe skaters, but it must not be forgotten that much loss of life had occurred in skating which it was desirable to prevent if possible He believed that the noble earl had greatly overstated the expense in estimating it at 14,0001;, and that it would be under A,5001., and that this would comprise not onl7 the clearing out of the lake, but the drainage of that Which had turned out to be a swamp on each side of these omamental grounds. Their lordships would, he hoped, be of opinion that this was not too large an expenditure when upon it depended not only the enjoyment but the actual health of the metropolis. (Hear, hear.) very noble lord had a right to bring in any extraneous topic he pleased into his speeches, and he should not, therefore, complain that three-fourths of the noble earl's speech was directed against matters which had no connexion with the subject of which he had given notice. He would admit that, although their lordBhips did not hold the purse-strings, they had no more important function than to warn Parliament, the Government itself, and the public when they saw any neglect of economy. Re should be the last to urge their lordahips to abstain from giving useful advice on this subject when they saw occasion to do so, but for the sake of trath and the utility of such debates, it was desirable that the House should be in a position to know the pros and cone of the matters in dispute. He believed that although the estimate of a late Commssioner of Worlk for the repair of King Charles's statue at Charing.cross was 1,0001., yet the sum actually expended was under 1001., If not under 501. The arl of Derby was understood to ask what became of the difference ?] If, however, he should be wrong, and if the whole sum of 1,0001. was expended, it onlyahowed how important itwasthatnoticeofthese ques* tionis shouald be give; in order to prevent members of the Government who might not be councoted with the depart. ment in question from falling Into error in their slate. menta. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the expenditure in the uablicpark,and thetemptingfacilitytowhichthenoble I earl aadldeaed of spending the public money upon them, he begged to remark that while on the one hand there could be nothing more criminal than to add to the burdens of the people for the useless ornament of the metropolis, yet, considering that the metropolis wu the capital of so large a kingdom, he believed that those who were not resident in it would feel disgusted If It were left in a neglected and unbecoming position. In many respects London, with its population of 2,500,000, was held to exhibit a great inferiority to many second-rate towns on the continent- bat it had one honourable and peculiar feature inits publio prks, which,while they addedtothedecent splendour of the Crown, at the raise time promoted the health and recreation of the poorest classes of the metro. polis. (Rear, hear.) The Minister, therefore, was deserving not of censure, but of encouragement, who applied himself adousgand economically to make those parks as helhuand as utiful as possible. (Hlear, hear.) He believed that the noble earl had entirely failed in making out any case against the department responsible for these works, and against the Government wbich sanctioned them, when he impugned, as uncalled for, the measures taken to purify the water used in the centre of the metropolis for the ornamentation of the public parks. (Cheers,) The Earl of HARDWICKE said that if the returns before their lordships were correct it would appear that grants of money made by Parliament for carrying out a particular object were not always expended for that purpose, bnt that any surplus which might remain after the works for which the vote had been taken had been completed might be expended in a way which Parliament had never contemplated (Hear.) If 1,0001. were asked for the cleaning of a statue, while only 501. were laid out, it waS very easy to understand how it was that sir B. HaU was enabled to carry on the works which he had undertaken. (Hear, hear.) Re should not say that that was the mode in which thowe matters were really managed, but, if not, the documents which had been placed in their lordships' hands were utterly valueless as a statement of the expenditure of the country, and ought to be taken back and revised by the Government. Hs noble friend opposite had just stated that it was impossible to frame an estimate of the outlay necessary for clearing of the water in St. Jamaes's Park, but their lordships must be perfectly aware that there was a very simple mode of ealculat. ing the sum which would be required for the purpose by takng the number of cubic yards in the space to be cleared and estimating the expense in accordance with that number. He should like to have some further Information from his noble friend upon that point, and should pLso wish to learn if he had consulted those deeply versed in subjecte ef that nature as to whether the circumstanoe of there being a few weeds in the water was sufficient to occasion that offensive vapour which generally arose from water in a state of stagnation? The position of the reservoir to which reference had been made was upon high ground, so that it supplied water to all the houses below it, and it seemed to him to be a somewhat extraordinary piece of engineering to take away water which stood at so great an elevation. He might also say that the improvements in St. James's Park were being carried out, he believed, not by the piece but by day work, and of course under those circumstances a very Vigilant superintendence would be required in order to get the men employed to go through a fair amount of labour. These were points upon which he should wish to have some information from his noble friend. Earl GRANVILLE said he had been informed that the consequence of allowing the weeds to accumulate in the water would be to create malaria, and that a gentleman of great experience in such subjects had entirely approved the mode in which the water had been dealt with. He must also inform his noble friend that the Improvements in the parks were not being carried out by means of day work, With respect to the charge of kesping the money granted to prosecute a particular work for the purpose of appropriating i to an entirely different purpose, he could only say that the thing ws abslutely impossibe, inasmuch as te Audit-office required that any sum which might not have been laid out on the proposed work should be repaid into the Treasury. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGEH regretted the noble earl had not informed the House whether the cleaning of the statue which had been mentioned was or was not to be done by day work. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) It was not perhaps exactly within their lordships' provmce to enter into those details of publlc expenditure, but he trusted there would be found in the new House of Commons some one man who would be competent to undertake the duties in that respect which had' been so long and so usefully performed by the late Mr. Hume. XHow it was that the House of Commons could have voted a sum of 1,0001. for the cleaning of a statue-unless, after it had undergone that process, they intended that it should be gilded-he could not Lord MONTEAGLE said that the noble earl near him (Earl Granville) seemed to be of oPinion that the surplus of a sums of maoney granted for one puroecould not, owing to thechek wichtheAudt.ofic exrciedover such transactons heappiedto noter;buthe(Lord Monteagle) regretedto e blied o nfom tei lodshpsthat no audit whatverwasappicale t an on ofthevotes which a peaed i the en uder heirnotice. In order to goenditure,- he mpight state the sim fact that, although 0 0001. had be en granted to defray t he funeral expenses of the late Duke of Wellington, yet there remained out of thab sUm 25,0001., not one farthing of whichhad been emploJedfor the purpose for which it had been voted, but which had, three years alterwards, been apphed to an entirely different use In a debate in the other House of Parliament it had incidentally transpired that this money had been thus misap- plied, and then, after some difficulty, the matter had been set right. He did not object to the Government of the day takdng a vote larger than the circumstances of the case might require, but he did complain of the application of mnoney voted by Parliament for one purpom to a purpose totally different, because in such caees it was more than doubtful whether it was ever reture ed to the credit of the public. (Hear, hear.) The works which were the subject of the present discussion had been commenoed with. out the sanotion of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl had statedthatthe Government might not have obtained a correct estimate of the expense, but there did not appear to him to be any difficulty in obtaining a correct estimate of the expense of draining a pond. (Hear, hear.) Even if a correct estimate could not be procured the Government ought to have taken a vote on account and not to have iancurred expenditure without the approval of Parliataeet. PHear, hear.) The course whioh had been adopted by the overnment as not a constitutional course (h , hear), and it ought not to be lightly passed over by their lordahips. Te subject, howvever, was one which no donbt wrould occupy terlrbi attention during the present session, and he rvadteeoereserve his observations to a more suitable occadon, ~ ~ ~ ~ a The Ear of WICEI OW rose to express his appzobation of the improvements which had been made in the metropolis under the management of the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Works. A most extensive systemI ~of doinNe had been carried on in the Regent's Park and in Hy^deParle, and by thme skilful arangement of walks, parts,of these paiks which formerly were almost deserted were now thronged with people, and thoso improvements had contributed greatly to the comfort and convenience of the publio. Lord STANLE]Y of ALDERLEY said that, if he had understoodthe noblelord (Lord Monteagle) correctly, he hadimplied that it was in the power of thaGovernment of the day, if there was any excess upon any estimate, to spend that excess innaan manaer they naght think fit, without re- Parliament. Now he begged to saythat tiat ooao~ was not practised by Government (hear, hear). and he did not think that the experience of the noble lod would enable him to tell their lordships and the public that it was,n the power of the Government to adopt such a couse. If in one department there should be an excess UpOZ one estimate, then the Treasury had power to expend t excess for analogous purposes in that same depart. ment, but it was not competent to them to employ mone voted for one purpose to objects totally different. With regard to the statue of Charles L, it was true that a vote of luO. had been taken, but that had been done under tbe impression that the pedestal and foundation were ineeoure; but it having turned out that such wgs not the oce a considerably smaller sum had been expeended. As to the surplus of 25,001. wvhih remained after the faneral of the Dnke of Wellington, he would undertake to say that none of that moneynhad been applied for any other pjurp o,lthough from the accounts not having been audited it had no doubt remained a considerable time in the Treasury. When, however, the accounts were audited the maitter would have been put sight. Lord MONTEAGLE wished to point out to the noble earl the errors into which he had fallen. He had sbted that it was in the power of the Treasury to apply sums of money voted for one purpose to analogous purposes in the sams department. l(ow, that vws true with regard to the army and navy, because a provision to that effect had been introduced by Sir J. Graham into the Appropriation Bill, but the principle did not apply in the slightest degree to the civil exPenditure of the country. The second error into which the noble earl had fallen was, that in the case of the surplus of the sumn voted for the funeral of the Duke of Wellington the matter would have bean rectified when the accounts were audited. Now, if he would look into the subject, he would find that the whole of the civil estimates were entirely out of the control of the Audit-office, and therefore any check upon the part of that office was impossible. He repeated that a sum of 25,0001., voted for one urpose,had been devoted to another. [Lord Stanley of deurey.-Not permanently.] Not permanently I This large sum had for a period of two years been applied without the sanction of the Treury to a purpose different from that for which It was voted and it was osly from the fact oozing out in the House of Lords that the matter had been set right. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said the country had not been deprived of the sum to which the noble lord referred. Prom his knowledge of the working of the civil departments he was oertain that no department would undertake to apply the surplus of one vote in aid of the diminution of another without application being made to the Treasury, and the approval of the Treasury being obtained. The subject then dropped. DESIGNS FOR PUBIJC OFFICES The Duke of SOMEERSET rose to put; questIon respecting the commission on the designs for public offces. He stated that within the last few days a Boyal commissionhadbeenappointedto examine and report on the designs now being exhibited in Westminster HalL Their lordships would remember thatwe hadhad such connissions in former times, and that on their reports we had begun buildings which we had not finished yet, and which he was afraid we would continue to build for a long time to come, while no one could tell what we would have to pay befoze we saw their completion. (Hear, hear.) He begged to warn the Government as to what they were about to undertake. He was afraid they were going to begin a system of the most ruinous expenditure }first of all they had invited architects to exhibit competing plans for public offices, and he belheved all the way from the Horse Guards to Westminster was given up to the taste of the artist. (Hear, hear.) Indeed, he understood Westminater-bnid e was inoluded also. Some time ago It was proposed to tage down that bridge. Then the Government determined to repair it, and now again it seemed to be in contemplation to take it down. (Hear.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the course of the last Parliament, 8 a warning to the country, that the block of ground which was required for the scheme now proposed would cost 1,500,0001. That was for the ground only. When we began these buildinp (the Housesof rarihament) we had at least the ground, whioh belonged to the Government, a very small portion onlyhaving been bought. But if the plans now proposed were carried out, did anybody suppose that the ground could be bought at 1,500,000 ? (Iear, hear.) Any one who knew the commercial spirit of this metropolimust be aware that the rice of the land would be immediately greatly enhanced, (Hear, bear.) But how far were these plans to be carried out ? When the Commissioners had agreed upon a particular plin Government would come down to Parliament for a vote of perhaps 50,000Z. on account this year, 40,0001 next year and so on for probably a period of not less than 25 years. (Hear.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that to carry out the ?lans covering this block of ground would cost 5,000,000. or 6,000 00 Now were we wise in beginning a scheme of tin ldnd ? (Hear, hear.) All he wished to know was how they conld guard themselves from suck an expenditure-how the nublc were to be protected from a eme which they were told on high authority would cost no lees than 5,000,0001. or 6,000,000l. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANVILIE said his noble friend had warned the Government against beginning a saystem of ruinous expenditure; but he begged to remind his noble friend that every step which had been taken by the Government in this matter had been in accordance with the recommendations of a comimittee of the other House of Parliament, which recommendations had been also very generlly approved by the members of their lordships! House. The first question asked by his noble friend, as he understood it, amounted to this-whether any instructions had been given to architects as to what site they might occupy. He would answer that by going back to some of the steparecommended by the select commpittee of the Hoese of Commons. They stated in their report that great inconvehience at present arose from the bad arrangement of the public officea, from the necessity laid upon G tovernment of hiring buildings in Inconvenient situations; and that it was most desirable, both for the convenience and efficienoy of the public service and on the groun:d of eonomy, that there should be a consentration of the public ofies, and that such concentration should be in the vicinity of Whitehall and the Houses of Parliament. The committee described the position and extent of the sites which they recommended, and the Government acting on that recommendation, hadIssued notices, in whic the architects of all nations were desired to send in desins for two different sites. One was for the bloc of building covering the whole of the larger site recommended by the oommittee; another was for two offices-viz., the War-office and the Foreignoffice.-on a smaller site adjoining Charles-street, of which the Government was now in possession, with the exception ot a very smaU portion indeed. A Bill wvould be introduced to Parliament giving power to purchase that small portion of the smaler site to which he had just alluded, and when that Bill came before them then would be the proper time for raising opposition to the scheme. As to the larger s.te, the Government had no plan of their own, and thou ht itbest to leave the matter open to publio competition, givng to architects an opportunity of showing how they would fill it up. Parliament could then choose whether they would go on withthe scheme or withapartof it,-having the public offices in a well devised and properly arranged manner, all connected with each other, instead of being, as now disconnected. This would be matter for future consideration. It was, however, clearly laid down that the architects would have no claim whatever, except for the prize money given for the several designs that might be a p proved. The plans would become the absolute copyright Of the Government, to choose from the several parts of each p lan as might be found desirable, and the architects would have no claim or control over them whatever. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said he had great respect for the opinion of the committee of the House of Commons, but it was not a matter of coursethat he should acquiesce in the resolutions of that committee, and therefore he felt bound to sk the noble earl opposite whether it was absolutely necessary to engage in an undertaking that would involve so enormoous an expense 9 (Hear.) It would be impossible to complete the contemplated buildis writhout incring an expenditure that would probably exceed the whole amount of the property tax of 7d. in the pound for a whole year. 4MHear.) Surely some rangement could be made to avoid the expenditure. Public attention had been called to the circum stances attendant upon the building of the Houses of Parliament. They had been building since 14, and the House was aware how enormously the original estimate had been exceeded. (HEIar, hear.) Some persons were pleased at that, bustothers, like himself, were mortfied and disgusted at the extravagant expenditure. He admitted the beauty of what h.^d been done, but he compLained that it war overdone, unnec_ssary, and out of character. (Hear.) No ouobt it vould he very convenient to have al the offlcea under one roof, but the danger of fire must not be overlooked, ad it was almost impossible to adopt precautions which should totally obviate all apprehension upon that account. Then, again, with regard to Buckingham Palace, alterations, and repairs, and extensions had been made which virtually created a new palace. He recollected a K ing who had lived comfortably enough in St. Jamnes's Palace, but what was the use of that palace now? Why could not that building be aplied to the pnoroses of publio offices? ear, hear. NO ulding ould boe found more convenient for a Foreign-office, especially for the offlcial receptions which the Foreign Minister was required to hold. Of what use, too, was Marlborough. house ? There was some trash there which, he regretted to sa,, ho had wasted half-an-hour in looking at, but which might be packed up and removed without much inconveni- ence to anybody. It was understood that Marlborough. house was to be appropriated for the residence of the Prince of Wales, but it was quite unfit for such a Purpose. There was not a room in which the Prince could conveniently receive visitors, and it would require an outlay of froma 50,000re to 100,0004 to render it at aU habitable ; but Marlborough.house, although not fit for the residence of a Prince, was perfectly adapted for the pur. poses of public offices which required small rooms. mor a very small expense a communication could be made between St. James's Palace, Marlborough. house, and the Ordnance-office, and the interveninmg building, known as Schomberg-house, was in the market, the lease being to be sold in a few days. The Government mnst study economy, or the people would not endure the burden of taxation. (Hear, hear.) If the House of Com. mons did not do its duty, their lordships must interfere and call public attention to the mubiect. The country must no be left without at least one House of Parliament to require that economy which was so important to the public interests. (Hear, hear.) - The Earl of MALMESBURY observed that.one of- tho reasons assiZzd for the imisense contemplated expenditur was the saving which would be effected in the hira cf offices, which at resnt cost the country Eomething like 30,000!. per nnt h. ao ncellor of the Enchequer, however, had told them that the purchase money of land, according to the proposed scheme, supPo3inz even there should be no rise in ita value, woulcl be 1.V500M, the interest of which, at 4 per cent. would be 60,000h., per annam. (Hear.) Earl GRANVILLgE repeAted that the Government had no intention of applying to Parliament to sanction the pur. chaso of the luger bIock of land. The Earl of ELLENBOROUJGH admitted the necesity ' of soma change as regarded the Foreign-office, the present ! building beng not only inconvenient but positively I dangerous ; but he was at a loEC to discover any ground for increased accommodation being afforded to the War Department. That department reall wanted less room than any other, for it was diminishing the Army in a ma-ner that appearedto him to be most alarming. Duing the last few years tho public had been consltntly caling for an incrase in oUr artillery corps, and 7et last weak it was announced there was tobe an extensive redaction in the strength of that arm. With an army now week and dailv diminishing there could be no neoessity for an increased staff and enlarged accommodation. Lord CAMPBELL wished to put in a word for the courts of justie He did not make any complaint s redd the sacommodation provided for the judges, bat that which ws corded tojurymen was moEt disgaefuL He hoed that in the plans for the improvement of public edifices that matter would not be pased over. The fapde of the law courts, the; were told-no doubt, correcti -interfered vith the full display of Sir C. sr beautii{l building. He would rejoice to ae some plan adoPted which, without transferring the courts of justice from Westminster.hali, to which they had an i-mmemorial prescriptive right~, woald remove the objection to whicha he nad referred. The zarqnis of LANSDOWN denied that the Government bounditself to any greet expenditure, becauseit said that improvements being necessary in ome offices in that part , London care should be taken not to allow those Improvements to interfere with any fature plan that might be adopted. Lord REDESDALE thought that the alterations which were first proposed in the public offlces in Downing-street would have led to greater expenditure hereafter than the contemplated more comprehensive plan, because the great bulk of property in the neighbouring shabby streets could be R d now on more advantaueos terms. If one side of the street only were taken, and publio offioes erected upoa the alto, the price of the other si wonid he immediately increas andpersonaswould be eneoured bythe improve ment to substitute better buildings, which would further increae the ultimate outlay; but if the whole of the ground which wouald probably be requibed werepocured at once, there would be no necesity to appropriate the whole of it, or even to lose the rents accruing from occupancy of that portion which was not immediately req HoeL e was convinced that if anything was to be doneeto erect new buildings in Downing-street, the truest economy was to purchase the present shabby buildings in Charles and Duke strets and get possession of the ground for ulterior purposes. The convemsstion ended, and Their Lordshlps adjourned, at a few minutes past 7 odeock.

THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK. _ Mr. CONINGHAM asked the Attorney-General whethe it was the intention of the Government to proeecute th directors of the Rojal British B»nk. (Hear.)

The House havbg resolved itself Into oommitîee forth· purpose of considering the oaths required to be taken by members of ParlUment on taking their seats «fter their election, lord PALMERSTON rose and said,-Sir, in rising t» make the motion of which I have given notice I ought It» the first piece to apologize to my noble friend tho member for the city of London for appearing to-take out of hi» hands a question which has long occupied his attention, and with which he has dealt in a manner ttat entitle» him to great credit, I can assure my nobh» friend th»t it was by no means from any wish to take unnecessarily from him a subject to- which he has devoted somuch attention th»tlg»ve notice of ttat motion (hear,, heu·); but I was told by tton who »re. most interested in tte question that the chance of any BiU whioh might be brought in passing into a Uw would bevery much increased by iU being introduced as »Government measure by a member of tte Administration (hear, hear) ; and, knowing tte deep and encere intere»* -wiiicl* my noble friend takes in the measure to which he hasa» long devoted his attention, lam quite sure ttat he will forgive me for appearing to take it ont ot ? hand«. (He»r.> It appeared to me, ttat if ever there was a moment pecuUarly favourable for calling the attention of the House totte oaths which are by Uirnow prescribed to members of ParlUment on taking their seats, the present -wasprecisely tt»t moment, because tte House having, been recently constituted every member whom I have the honour of addressing mnst have fresh in his ?????????? thee» o»ths which by tte present Uw he ha» been compelled totake, containing, I am sure I need not aay, many things that every man must be very reluctant to mbseribe to under the solemnity of an o»lh, and which mnst therefore bemost repugnant to his feelings. (Loud cheers.) There cannot, I apprehend, be a more solemn act than the taking of an oath. It is an invocation byamantoHisCreatortoglr» Hiesanction to an engagement which that man is about to undertake. That man has thereby pledged to a certain degré» his future weUbeing for the performance of certain duties which by his oatt ha has undertaken to discharge.' Soen engagemente h»ve been sanctioned bythe practise of aU nations. There »re duties of such importance in this world» that it is fitting th»t those who have to diaeharge then* should bind themselves by the mort solemn sanction to a due> andconscientious performance of th'em. Butthe more solemn, the act the greater is therespoasibffiiy whicha man incurs by taking an oath. The more that engagement is entitled tothe respect of men, in the same proportion oughfc to be the seldomnees of its being taken, anot the importance of tte occasion npon which it is taken. (Hear, he»r.) To invoke tte Supreme Being; with reference to eng» gemente which »re absurd» and which no man could be supposed to break, is a prof»· nation of a sacred rite. (Loud cheers.) It is, in fact, a- breach of that commandment which forbids man to take the; n*me of his Creator in vain. There are things in the oath» we now take which were, no doubt, fit to be sworn to in. times long gone by, but which are so in»ppUcable to the; days in which we live, »nd to the persons by whom those oaths are to be taken, that they are revolting to the mind of every reasonable man. (???, he»r.) I m»y observe ttat tte changes which I propose to make do not apply to the oath taken by Roman Catholics. That oath was settled upon full deUberation at tte tim» when the disabilities of Catholics were under dis»· cussion. I do not Intend to disturb that settlement. (Hear, hear.) The ohange which I »m about to propose »ppUes solely to the oaths to be taken by persons who are· not of the CathoHo religion. The object of the ??. which I beg leave to introduce is, ln the first plaoe, to relieve Christians from the necessity of taking oaths which ai& repugnant to tteir reason »nd to their feelings. (Hear, he»r.) But, ia tte next pUce, by so doing I propose toput an end to the Ust remn»nt of former prejudice and· exclusion. The change which I am about to propose would! not onlyreUeve a Christian from oaths which a Christian. ought not to be called upon to taie, but would atoo sweepaway ttat portion of one of those oaths which is the onlyobstacle to the reception of Jews in this House of Parttá-* ment. (Cheers.) It is hardly neceesary for me to remino*. tte House of the oaths which we now by law aro compelled to take. So long as tte Uw compels ns to take ttoee oaths. we submit to tte necessity, and no man can blame a person who submits to the Uw. But I do s»y ttat if tte House has the power, which I contend it has, to reUere itself froro. these proftt»tions of »s»crcd rite, the House would incura heavy reeponsibiUty if it didnot exercise thai powerå, and reh'eve individual members from the necessity of continulnir to take those oaths. Wh»t I propose to do U to abolish, irt »U cases in which they are by Uw required to, be) t»ken, the o»th of »llegUnoe as it now stands, theoath of supremacy, and the oath of abjuration, and to· substitute for ttose three o»tts one single oath, which. .haU contain the oath of »Hegumoe as well as that which is requisite in the other oaths, but which shaU leave out aU ttose portion« of them which I conceive are not fitting or proper to be retained. The oath of »UegUnce wül stand as it now does, witt such additions as I have mentioned. But to begin with the oath cf supremacy. That oath is as follows:·« I do swear ttat I do from my heart abhor, detest an* abjure as impious and heretic«! that d»mn»ble doctrine ani position that princes excommunicated or deprived bv Oui Pope or any authority of the see of Rome may be derxZedoit murdered by their subjects or »ny otherwhatsoerw» On what possible ground are we eaUed upon to take lh»6oath?

APrRAL SIR C. JWMD AND HTh URGENT. TO THE EDITE?) OF THE TEMES. Sirs-Before writing myvietter on the evening of the 9th inst.. Preferred to several newspaper reportof what Sir Charls- Wood had sad in the House of C6mmons the day before about the steam traurports. In The .Armes I found " Attob-is of this sort were, very amusing, because they seemed to imply that it was oWly Governmentst vessels that suffered-from bad weather; imla circumstance had come to his k swled which show ad;tIat other vessels-had suffered also. At the very time the Urgent went to sen'a Ene merchant ship did so likewise, and, encountering thes same gale was not slghtly injured like the Urgent, but- was driven back diszmantled." In the Sun-the report was- urly word for word similar. The paragrap4 in the Globe, cogmencing, " With regad to the Urgent," ended, "had: arrived at Barbadoes in. safety. In the same gale the Megara drifted away, and only got over to the coast of' Portugal about a month afterwards under jury-masts," I particularly alhdeed to the report of the latter 1gurnal, as likely to b the Ifinisterial view-of the matter under discussion. Nht hav4er been pregent at the debate I oould only take the r3pezrtaK found published. Certainly, IDsever for a momrent imagined the First Lord -ws intentionaly distorting facts, lbntD l3tought and saidthe mistake waaa part of the defective "cramming" which-was evident ineoYer parts of his spsecdm. There is not in any paper that I c.a see the extract from albtter decribing. the Urgent as- going into Coranna ln smooth water, and Ircan hardly thinaso many pairs of 2porteo s ears were mistaken in what was said. Wexe they eqAlly at fault in recording the "amusement" of the Admralty ch3ef at the discovesy that a merchant ship had como offt second best in a gal where a powereful first claas steans was her accidental rival? For; after all, whether a. posaible slip of the tongue did or did not give " Urgent" for. "lNegera," the fick remains the same in reard to the bragging comparison. Considering, the number of names of bad ships which had necessrily to be mentioned, it was. a great mistake to drag in another which had never before bee alluded to, and abqut which the-1-4iJo.hael nothing, batthetemptation4o speak of a Queen's ship which, though driven into poMiherself, had seen a non-official vessel's masts over the side was irresistible. IHence the additional entanglement lwichwas just as likely to.bave bothered tbe, debater In the utterance as the reporter ia the recording. We are now.authoritatively awar that the inhabitants of disastrous-Coranna have seen yet one more of the AAbniÃ¯Â¿Â½alty refugeesthan we knew of bafore. Thus much for Sir Charles's notlee of the first part of nav letter. None- has been given. to the remainde.v It still remains, B conclude, a i'ct that two little stiling ships of the merchant navy (of 560 and 591 tons respectively) did more a good deaDin 52 and 63 days, for the publio service. in the same line-than the " official-pt " (of between 2,009-and 3,000 tons) dia in 74. Nor were the little ones obligedi to go into quarantine at Fays, or any. other " refuge fozrthe destitute,"en the way home.

About 15@gentlemen sat dowiato a good dinnGi, which was vwell served, and better relisheiL At its conclusion, and the custosuay toasts of " the Ro"al Family" and " the President of the Hospital" having been duly honoured, the Chairman made an appropriate and most forcible appeal on behalf of the charity, which he regretted to,observe was not aided by the charitable public to an extent commensurate eitker with its wants or As usefulness. ]Da)ring the vast year the number of mnedl in-patients had been 941; surgical ditto, 748- and admissions of accidents, 579making a total of 2,26S. Mhe number of ont-patients for the same period had been 16,844, giving a. grand total of l%112 persons relieved or cured during 1856. The income from all sources during the 3pst 12 montbs was Fcarcely enough to meet half the calls upon the charity, and the expenditure account consequently showed an excesa uiver receipts of 4,893. The chairman's appeal was promptly responded to, aliberal subscription of 1, 0WM being announced as received during the course of the evening, ef which sum 1001. was the gift of Her Majesty, and 1001. from the President, the Duke of Northumberland. Mr. M. Smith, in returning thanks for the treasurer, dcrew attention to the fact that the deficiency of income only arose from the-increased accommodation afforded by the hospitl, and. the consequent increase of the number of patients. The actual amount of annual subscriptions had not fallen off sl all. The musical arrangements were exoelent, and the entetainment was altogether of a most satisfactory character. oIETRopoTITAw BoxuD oF WoR}s.-The orAinary meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works was hbld yesterday at Guldhall, Mr. J.

I0s said that the public were under an imprssion that great delay had been occasioned in the consideration of these plan, but that had arisen fromthe largeandextendednfieldof in(iriessubmitted tothem. Mr.Daltonsecondedthe motion. A discussionensueA inthcoure mof wbhs amemberof th*Board deo o the policy adoptedby SirB. Hill in'strong terms. Au amendment was propose& by Major Lyca, to the effIct Vati the Board should merely ackno ged#;_the recelpt of thW letters. On a divigsn, however, the original inotiaWas carried by 17 to 14. A communicatiea was then laid bfore the Board fromi Commander B a B.N., pointig out, various nuisances whieh ho had niet with in the o*rsie a, b turvey now being made by him of the river T hxaes Id this communication special notice is taken of te Kins Scholars Pond sewer above Vaunxhall-bridge, aiutbe Ml fask Penitentiary sewer, both of which empty themselves into the river alongside the quays, and thus Ae sewage is dispersed over the foreahore between high and low -water mark, causing tbe most noxious effluvia to arise from the river shore in those localities. In conclusion, tae document Ulludes to some bone, size, and soap factories near the river, I etween ITnAbeth Palace and thegasworks near Vauxha12. bridge, from which the most disgusting malaria proceeds. The Board ordered this memorinl to be printed. An adjownment then took place. Tnx AcarNT ZiAi SOUTHsu CAsTi.-.The notice which appeared in The Times a week ago of the Iatal accident near Bouthsea Castle, Portsmouth, when a gentlemau was unfortunately drowned, has been the means of bringing a letter from the Council of the Royal Humane Society, which it wiU be satisfactory to know bag had the desired effect, as drags and lifebuoys wiU be placed immediately along Southses beach as far as Southsea Castle, which latter will be, by the kind permission oi Colonel Lake, C.B., commeanding officer of Royal Artiery in Portsmouth Garrison, under the charge ot the master gunner of that fortress.

The 1arl: of- MixMESBURY calld& the attentioa, of the- House to. the improvaesents now being effected, in St. Jhames's Park, whicii he contende& were uRuecessary. and extravagaut, involvingr asn they did- an, expeaditure of li40@0t The x:obe;lord tien, went. on to remark, on the enormoAs. increae which had taken placa-ali late years in theMiscellaeous. Etlimates, and insisted that soaem. limit ought to bi- put to thisexiravagant expenditure. Lord-Gx~urro said, that ths increase irath. expenditure for.- the improvccnSn~s in St. JaMes's. Park was-owing4 to the increaseI difflculty vhich had ateaded.theexecution of ithese improvemnentss. HIe denied that the woroks rien completed would, cost 14;0001:,. as Lord MAxEiuuay asserted, for. it wouli-be, found that the total. expense didnot emceed'.1i;090. He thought it. w-eld be fouadathat the money spen4iin improving'the ParkE, whichcontributedcso mueh to the health, and recreation of th, peop*,.wase3pended for a4mly national purxpoa, and. he insist;ed that Lordt MAIAIESBuaY had entirely failediia establishing his point. After some further discussion, in Which. Lord4a HARDWIMBI3, ELLENBOROt-rg, WIcKLow, andM E:Lz took part, the manten dropped. The- Dulk of Somszmasaked for some infomtion resoting the plans-rthe public ofei;. Be wished, to,know how the-public were to beprotectefi froma. seheme which they were told on compatsot authority was to cost 5,GOGOIOOL or 6,000G0001. I Lord GxA.viE replied,that every ster.thah haI hitherto been taken in. this matter had: been sanctioned by Parliament. ARl that was intended at prese4 was to carry oat by Act of Parisamt a, *small portion of the enaller of two plans poooed for the concentration of the public effibo. The Splans sent in for coveaig a larger aea.of ground,. ; and which would invrolve the expendi~s ithat had so muachalarmed ths nobleDuke, boundtho.Govern. meat to nothing. The Earl of Ei3 rWooruGH thoughAthe "xpenditare enormous. B1- thought a very eflic:t series :of public offices might be made outhot S. Jamessa *Palace, MarToreughhouse (which lwa fed witi* trash), the Ordn3nce Office, and Shomberg-house. t SEhe Governmeat must study economy, or thek people would not endure taxation. After some further discussion thamater dropped, and their Lordcbips adjourned. In the House of Commons, ox% the occaion of a question put by lUr. CONNGMIXt, whether it waw. the intentio. of the Govermniea. to prosecute the1 Directors of the Royal Britis Bak, The AT!L -Gra'XiuL made a reply (ibe. term of which are given elewhere), from which,it will be diftlt, if not impowssie, to oollectwha4w there be or be not any. suc% ia ieon. . * Ontbho-mtion.that. the -oMe at its risiNg 4k adjournuatil MIonday, lordi u .CECIr. inquirie *her the rep" Re., spect3g thetreatment; tha 42 -Chinee **mom at Uongkong were true- P t.

What is the use of all our K.G.'s if Ithey cannot rid Parliament of the dragons and <other monsters that devour its time and strength ? They reappear as regularly as the Sphinxes and Minotaurs that beset the gates of some unfortunate city, and would not depart without their complesnent of youths and maidens or well-to-do respect able travellers. There is always to bo a Bi1 for the abolition of some ridiculous or superfluous oaths, and the admission of a useful and lionourable class of citizens; it is always to pass the Commons, whom it does a little concern, and :lways to be prerw-hed and prayed out of the Liords, 'who have nothing to do with it. The same farce of alarmed patriotism and outraged piety is always -to be acted tover again, with 'the satue tones 4and the same grimace, and men who never ,did any good besides, and never will, annuaUy quiet their consciences with this paltry persecution. When this dreary scene has been acted for the fiftieth time there stalks in another relic of the .nntediluvian world in the shape of a Maynooth debate. Gaunt and grim, the survivors of an -extinct race crush their way through the common sense and humanity of these later days, trampling, Trending, and rolling over the gentler feelings and the kinder influences of the modern creation. Is it impossible to noose this Leviathan, and send 'him back to his muddy deep? Can neither strength mor artifice now avail, at a time when we have two hippopotami in the Regent's Park, and whales, -sea lions, and sea devils are ordinarily advertised for show or for sale? It can only be a question of hooks and nets, spears, and harpoons. Certainly, if thcse crusades had any hope of a succesful and quiet termination, if there were -fair reason to anticipate that in a few years the Papists or the ' Jews could be either exterminated or reduced to elavery, and their goods divided among the captors, or so humbled as not to lift up their heads or wagI their tongues for the next 30 years, ve could scarcely have a word to say against the crusade. Success is an argument that speaks for itself, and, flotwithstanding the old sneer about " making "a solitude and caling it peace," we should not be too curious to inquire into the means by which -we bad been delivered from the annual Maynooth debate and the annual Oaths debate. But our modern persecutors, not being alloweed the use of dungeons, gridirons, fagots, pincers, cords, stretchers, iron boots, and other implements of orthodoxy, make very poor work of it. They only nibble and scrape, and, as they have neither teeth nor nails, their nibbling and scraping become mumbling and fumbling, disagreeable, bat harmless. They only take up time; they occupy, distract, molest, and generally annoy the Legislature, like some of the smaller animals which disgust rather than hurt, but are not the less nuisances. But nuisances of this sort, like the giants and monsters of the mediheval epic, only require a little courage- and momentum to put an end to them. One step in advance, or one touch of the spear, so as it be in earnest, is enough to kill. Now, here is the Oaths Bill. Unless something be done, it wiN be thrown out in the Lords, as heretofore. 'llere will be as many " non-contents" as before, and no more " contents." It is the latter figure that is to be treated. Lord PAMnMISTox has a great majority in the Lower House, immense popularity, and generally a winning eause. Why, then, can he not deal with this as with the. China question, and have the younger lords, and even the newly-appointed bishops, laid under admonition t The opposition is nothing but a hollow, flimsy, hypocritical prejudice, if it be, indeed, worthy of that name. There is not one single text in the Bible to favour the exclusion of Jews from a Christian Legislature, while there are many texts establishing the perfect lawfulness of Christians fighting in the same ranks with Jews, holding office together with them, paying them taxes, receiving their taxes in return, and finally sitting in the same councils with them. You might just as well expect to find a text in favour of extraeting a Jew's teeth to get at his money, or making him wear a yellow gabardine, or spitting on him, or holding pork to his nose, or calling him a dog, as in favour of excluding him from any portion of a Christian Legislature. The whole thing has come up since, and belongs to a system which nearly every one of the Bench of Bishops denounces every time he gets into a pulpit. It is quite as much an innovation on Scriptural and primitive Christianity as any of the peculiar doctrines of Popery. You may, indeed, find texts in the New Testament to colour Transubstantiation, Purgatory, the Invocation of Saints, and so on, but not one even colouring the doctrine that a Christian must not deliberate and act with a Jew on a question of taxes, of peace aud} war, of arts and sciences, of sewerage and drainage, or such temporal matters. In point of fact, there happens to be no religious community with which the State has more dealings, in proportion to its numbers, than the Jews. England and all the Christian Powers of Europe have the most important transactions with the Hebrew capitalists, and on theses occasions we have no doubt of their honour or their patriotism-that is, their disposition to make sacrifices, if necessary, for the welfare of the country wherein they dwell. It is sufficient for the purpose, however, that we make them pay taxes like other men; and on every principle of justice and consistency we should allow them to be represented by their own people in the * expenditure of those taxes-eonfessedly the chief ,business of Parliament. As to Maynooth, it is quite time the gentlemen who are always reopening this angry sore should be made to understand that they do it with some risk. WVe do not wish to see Maynooth a bit more endowed or established than it is, for no prescription can entirely overcome the absurdity of raising and disseminating a swarm of priests to wage war against the Established Church and relinquishing our hold upon them at the very moment when it is most wanted. Yet, as the hope of peace and quiet has already led to the Maynooth " grant" being transferred to the Consolidated Fund, so the further agitation of the matter must certainly end in some attempt to remove it still further from the Limbo of Controversy. It has been proposed to compound with the Roman Catholics by a round sum of money-half a million or so, or an endowment in land, so as to take Afaynooth altogetherout of the reach of its Parliamentary assailants. In this case the money or land would be vested in trustees, whose duties would be laid down in the deed of trust, and, if any gentleman had reason to suspect that the provisions of the deed were not properly observed, he would, no doubt, be able to get the question discussed in the Court of Queen's Bench. Indeed, Parliament might provide facilities for this purpose, only taking care that the costs of the suits should not fall on the Treasury. Should land or rentcharges be preferred for this purpose-and it would be an object to save the 600,0001. that would otherwise be required-then the funds of some of the Irish ecclesiastical sinecures mighlt be so applied without injustice or injury to anybody. Such a measure is not likely to be proposed if the Anti-Maynooth party wil only be so good as to be quiet ; but, if it is proposed, it is likely not only to be carried, hut to lead to other measures in the same direction. :For our part, we would rather that Maynooth were left just as it is, in its present anomalous and unsatisfactory state; but, if that cannot be, then, as we have said, anything to settle or banish the controversy, and send the disputauts to tear one another to pieces somewhere else. Something, however, ought to be done to save the time of Parliament for the many pressing questions which suffer by delay. Lord PALaMUSTONO has a neutral position, a dexterity, and a popuIarity which peculiarly qualify him for such a task. Ours is the only Legislature in the world which is robbed of much of itb time by debates certain to end in nothing but mutual exasperation. Debates of the sort we have alluded to are mere faction fights, town and gown rows, rude games tolerablo Ionly when they are confined to the belligerents,and cost nothing but a few broken heads and :black eyes. If the most bellicose members of both. Houses could be told off, and both sides equally represented for a fight with sticks and stones in Battersea Park or the Isle of Dogs, then we should certainly not ask the interference of any venerable senator to prevent the usual results. We should be only too happy to see the iingleaders carried home on stretchers, and reappearing after a few days honourably decorated with black plaisters and arm-sling. The affair would figure at length in the sporting journals, and our columns would be 1ightened of much matter that was never very redable, and has now lost the charm of novrlty. If the disputants cannot be persuaded tc, adopt this ourse, then it is high time the Ninirster should take the strongest and directest line. in his power. We have not the least doubt th' at he can pass the Oaths Bill he introduced las, ni ght not only throuigh the Commons, but throzgis the Lords, if he will only exert the whole iD .ce of his position; and we think the House Q Commons, which gives him that positioul, hv% -rig&t to, expect that he will use it, to prevent their being again dragged through the dirt by the House of Lords. _ _I---
The question of the cotton aupply is one which can be argued up to a certain point with complete demonstration and universal assent. The importance of the subject is beyond aU impeachment. At the Society of Arts on Wednesday evening last some statistics were produced which wil enable the most cursory reader to carry in his memory the magnitude of the facts. Of the total exports of this country-that is to say, of the whole of that produce by the value of which we maintain our national position-one-third is constituted by cotton manufactures lone. Lastyear, after clothing the entire population of these islands, our cottonspinners exported goods to the amount of more than 32 millions sterling in price; and so extensive is the operation of this supply upon the general prosperity of the country that an increase, as Lord S Tmxy observed, of Id. per pound in the cost of the raw material is equivalent to a national loss of four or five millions. Ia short, as our wealth depends upon manufactures, so do our manufactures depend upon cotton, and unless cotton is supplied in sufficient quantities, our industry and our opulence must fail together. Here is the first step in the argument-a step admitting of no doubt or question. The next concerns the insecurity of this allimportant supply as at present organized. Of the 900,000,0001b. weight of cotton which we imported last year 700,000,0001b. came from the United States, and, as our readers know, from the Southern provinces of the Union especially. Now, the cotton crop is not only liable to the ordinary atmospheric calamities, but is cultivated through the instrumentality of an institution which nobody can approve, and which many are ardently striving to abolish. Slavery and cotton-grow. ing act and react upon each other-slaves produce the cotton harvest, and the value of this harvest stimulates the practice of slaveholding. The result of all this is, that fourfifths of our entire supply are exposed to a double hazard-to the chances of the climate, where a bad season for any part of the crop is a bad season for the whole, and to the chances of domestic trouble, where trouble of some sort seems always menaced. If our imports of cotton were made up of contributions from several quarters of the globe, as was once the case, a bad harvest in one country might be compensated by a good one in another, whereas by depending upon America alone we are keeping all our eggs in a single basket. And even this does not comprise all the bearings of the case. Our supply from America, besides being thus insecure, is actually insufficient, and threatens to become more so. This, in fact, is the more alarming feature of the two. As regards the insecurity of the supply from the United States, we might perhaps rely without much apprehension upon the zeal and vigilance of the American planters and upon the operation of interests as active on one side of the ocean as on the other. Anything like an absolute 'failure has never occurred yet, and perhaps, therefore, never might occur; while the organizaticn of the trade across the Atlantic is so perfect and the article itself of such excellent quality that nothing better could be asked than the continuance and expansion of such a commerce in the proportions desired. Unfortunately, however, the Americans themselves have felt and acknowledged that, in the matter of cotton, consumption has been gaining upon production until the resources of the latter are likely to give way. Since 1817 our consumption has risen from 88,000,0001b. to tentimes that amount,, and other countries are becoming consumers too. It is therefore manifestly of the utmost importance that we should look about for fresh sources of supply; and this is the second stage of the argument, allowing of no more dissent thin the first. In what direction, then, are we to go for what we so urgently want? As it happens, cotton is by no means peculiar to a single soil or two, as must be evident, indeed, from what has been mentioned about our importations in times past. It will grow freely in many parts of Asia, Africa, and America-not everywhere, perhaps, in equal perfection, but, at any rate, in almost boundless quantities. More than soil, however, is required for such harvests as these. Cotton planting on the scale now spoken of requires plenteous capital, vigorous energies, and, above all, cheap and abundant labour. The fulfilment of this last condition can be looked fo.r at present in one country only, and that country is India. In this, as in so many other particulars, nothing can exceed the resources of our Oriental empire. It was stated by Mr. SMiirT, the member for Stockport, at the meeting on Wednesday, that a single province of India, bearing about the same proportion to the whole dependency that the county of Kent does to Great Britain, could of itEelf produce more cotton than the total growth of the United States. The country, moreover, is exceedingly populous, and the people patient, industrious, and docile. As a practieal result, therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that the cultivation of cotton in India is perfectly feasible, and is of the greatest and most urgent importance to our national prosperity. Those who have not given much previous attention to this question may be likely enough to marvel where, after all these successful demonstrations, the difficulty can lie. If India were still the patrimonyof the MooGsL the case might be different, but as it is British territory, under British government, ard as we have certainly no lack of energy or capital, wby should we not forthwith grow cotton in Candeish as summarily as we grow corn in Norfolk, and thus make one part of the empire find aliment for another, to the manifest advantage of the whole ? The answer to this inquiry involves the only embarrassments in the ease, and we cannot but trust they will admit of virtual removal. India, though under British government, is not immediately under that government which we enjoy at home. It is administered by the East India Company, and after a fashion not exactly agreeable to British speculators or residenbs. Over a vast portion of its territories no land ea be acquired in fee simple, and, what is of more weight, perhaps, than any such specific disability, the. whole country is in the, -hands and under. the government , of . a; body. of. men .wlio>. aa. con-. trasted with mercantile settlers, may be. regsded as a privileged and dominant clAss, An inde-: pendent' Englishman in India. is cWnthi%W like 3n independent Londoner in a Pal3mall slub, if suCh a position can be imagine& It is r,ue. that personal and commercial freedom, can now be enjoyed to a far greans extent than formnerly, but there still remai-s. enOii& control and domination to be very atastehij to free settlers. In point of fact, excspt as officers of the Company, Englishmen will not go in any number to India. They will go to Hongkong, Sierra Leone, the Falkland islands, or Bermuda, but they wi1l not settle, freely in IFindogtan. The consequence is tha's two out of the four requiites for cotton produe,e are wanting. There is the soil and there are th',. husbaudmen, but the capital and the energy are not forthcoming. Of course, it will be suggested as a remedy both natural and expeditious that this state of things should be terminated or modified by the more or less conr 2lete assimilation of India to the other domini ons of tho CQuowr, and some such result we sb ould certainly rejoice to witness. It would be e.hildish, however, to deny or conceal the fact that impediments to this assimilation are found not only in the traditions of the Company but in the actual and visible disposition of the Indian population. India, in these conditions, resembles no other British dependency. It is not an unsettled or a half-settled country where a sparse or mongrel population gives way or disappears before the hardy Anglo-Saxon element. It is an ancient empire, peopled to overflowing with a race which, though indifferent to political independence, is frantically apprehensive of innovation, and so instinctively given to the luxury of plotting as to conspire often without any practical idea of revolt. A Filibuster in a nunnery would hardly be more out of place than a Manchester agent in a Hindoo village. If other British territories are otherwise governed, other British territories, it should be remembered, are not liable to convulsions from a mistake as to the grease on a cartridge or the ornament on a headdress; and the anomalous administration is but adapted to an anomalous state of affairs. Here, however, is the hitch. Englishmen will not carry their capital to India because they do not like the government under which they would have to live; and this government must almost necessarily be objectionable, because it is framed, in the first instance, to meet the requirements of a totally different race. The question seems one of adjustment, and it may possibly be difficult; but those who produce a solution will be among the best benefactors of their country, and the gratitude of the public is fairly due to all who, lik-e the promoters of the recent meeting, bring the subject into prominent and serviceable notice.
If any reader should imagine it hopeless for ordinary persons to obtain a clear idea of the national Revenue, we think we can presently disabuse him of his error. Our accounts, indeed, may admit of simplification, but the muere income of the State is as plain and comprehensible a matter as the income of a private tradesman. It is divided into two large branches, one of which comprises the duties levied on commodities brought to us from abroad, and the other the duties levied upon produce or proceedings at home. The items in the first branch go under the general name of Customs; those of the latter under that of Inland Revenue ;andhereisthewholerevenueofthecountry. The Customs yield about 23,000,0001. a-year, the Inland Revenue about 27,000,000l.-making together some 50,000,0001. as the general income of the State in ordinary times. In fact, for the 10 years immediately preceding the late war the actual Revenne ranged from 51,000,0001. to 54,000,0001. without any wider variation. When emergencies occur, the Income-tax provides us with a special instrument of aid, and produces about 1,000,0001. sterling annually for every penny in the pound of duty. A few minor and miscellaneous receipts are brought in afterwards, but they may be neglected in a broad consideration of the whole. Supposing, however, a correct idea of facts to be acquired from this outline, how are the details to be understood ? This information also is readily attainable. On each of the two great subjects abovementioned a report has recently appeared, giving a large amount of intelligence, well digested and well arranged. The incidence, indeed, and the operation of any particular tax or duty can now be investigated with great facility, and its mnerits or demerits easily weighed. One important branch of Revenue-that arising from the Postof Ece-though not conspicuous in the mere amount of its return, is so special in its character as to require consideration apart from the rest, and it has been treated accordingly in a report by itself, which we selected for analysis a.few days ago. To the Report upon the Customs, too, our readers have been already introduced, and it now remains to make them acquainted with that upon the Inland Revenne. The Inland Revenue comprises three principal sources of income-the Excise, Stamps, and " Taxes," specially so termed, which contribute to the total of 27,000,0001. abovementioned in the proportions of 17,000,0001., 7,000,0001., and 3,000,0001. respectively. The gross receipts, indeed, of the Excise Duties in the year ending vith .I1arch, 1856, exceeded 18,000,0001., and of this upwards of 15,000,0001. was raised from Spirits and Malt alone. The Spirit Duties hold a peculiar and exceptional place among taxes, for here there is no object in encouraging consumption, nor is it any matter of congratulation that the sale of such commodities should increase. The chief end in view is the maintenance of the Revenue, and, if this could be attained as well by a high as a low rate of duty, the former would be as admissible as the latter, except for the important consideration of illicit manufacture. WVhen the duty is very high the premium placed upon unlawful distillation becomes irresistible, and disorder and troubles are sure to ensue. The late increase of duty on Spirits has been attended with a diminution of consumption, but the Commissioners do not regard the deficiency as due altogether, or even in a material degree, to the aiugmented tax, and are disposed to anticipate improved returns in future years. A relaxation made in one point of the law is very remarkable, not as affecting any considerable amount of income, but as showing how singular and remote may sometimes be the operation of a tax. Of course, the idea of a Spirit Dutyis a dutyupondram-drinking-upon luxury, at any rate, if not upon intoxication ; but it happens that Spirits are also wanted for purposes utterly unconnected with such tastes. T'hey are used in various manufactures, in many operations of chymistry, and even in museums they may be sean to fill many a bottle, with its "specimen" enclosed. Now, as it was certainly rather hard to visit these harmless employments of alcohol with the weight of a duty intended to be penal, how was the difficulty to be evaded? If Spirits were allowed to be sold duty-free for these uses, where was the security that, though purchased on such pretences, they might not fnd their -u.y down people's throats ? The Commissioners escaped the dilemma by an amusing expedient. After "an extensive series of experiments" they at last hit upon a preparation so nauseous that when mixec with spirit it would render it undrinkable, although the chymical. properties of the alcohol remaine&dunimpaired. In this state, and under, the namen of " Methylated.Spirit,' the required comnioity can be obUined,. on cestain coditions, duty-free ; and the icrifce`of &2,221L of revenue was thus made las year for tie betiefit of Ã¯Â¿Â½eience and trade. After Spirits aad Malt the chief items of Excise are those drawn from Paper, and from the 'Licenses required for the pursuit of various trades-each between 1,O0,040W. and 1,500,0001. The branch of the Lnland Revenne constituted by the Stamp Duties does not exhibit any items of such marked preponderance as those of Spirits and Malt in the returns of the Excise. The Legacy and Succession Duties produce the largest amount -viz., 1,7000,;001., but Fire Insurances yield 1,300,0001.; Probates of Wills and Letters of Administration 1,200,0001., and Deeds and other instruments as much more, roumd numbers being taken throughout. iNewspapers now yield only 260,0001., and among the minor heads of Revenue we find l4,0001. derived from gold and silver plate, 40,0001. from patent medicines, and 12,000?. from cards and dice. U'nder Stamps too are included certain licenses distinct from Tnose distributed under the heaAi of Excise. The forier comprehend, brevwem publicaus, grocers, maltsters, tea-dealers, &e. The latter include attorneys, bankers, pawnbrokers, hawkers, and so forth; but produce altogether only some 200,0001. If we omit the'Income-tax, in its huge but anomalousproportions, and confine our attention only to the regular and ordinary imposts clased under the denomination of " Taxes," it is surprising to find how very little income is raised under this old-fashioned and comprehensive title. Les than two millions, in fact, out of the -whole fifty composing the national Revenue, is produced by " Taxes," and these are all levied more or less upon luxuries, with the exception of the House-duty, now taking the place of the old Window-tax. The latter used to yield about 1,700,0001.-the former produces the odd thousands, minusthe million. Asingularfactisrecorded of the difference in the incidence of these two duties upon the metropolitan population. Of the whole Window-duty London used to pay only about onethird (57, 000.'. out of 1, ,00,0001.); of the Houseduty it pays nearly one-half (330,0001. out of 720,0001.). The rest of these Taxes will be familiar to many readers under their title of " Assessed," and we are presented with a comparison of their operation in the years 1854 and 1856. From these figures we should infer that servants, carriages, and horses were kept in considerably greater numbers than before, were it not for an explanation by the Commissioners, that the abolition of exemptions has lad something to do with the increase. Proceeding, however, to items unaffected bythis consideration, we observe that more dogs are certainly kept than formerly; and tlhere are also more horsedealers, though fewer packs of hounds. Hairpowder too exhibits-perhaps not unnaturally-a slow decline, but this form -of poll-tax is still raised in above a thousand instances. Gentlemen entitled to coat armour-or, at any rate, avaiEng themselves of their privilege-appear to be rather fewer in number than before (39,000 against 40,000), but there is an increase in the number of Game Certificates taken out, though the Commissioners observe that an unnecessary degree of inconvenience attaches to the levy of this duty, and that a lower rate would probably prevent evasion without diminishing the revenue derived. A circumstance recorded in connexion with the Carriage Duties points curiously to the tenacity of a custom when once established in the country. An exemption was allowed in certain cases, provided the name and occupation of the owner were painted outside the vehicle. As the privilege led to abuse, it was discontinued, but the practice of painting the name has been retained to this day, though the object of the superscription has disappeared. The gross total of receipts from the Inland Revenue for the year ending with March, 1856 -Income-tax being now included,-amounted to 44,000,0001., and this sum was collected at a cost of 31. 8s. 8d. per cent. Much economy, as well, no doubt, as much convenience, has resulted from the consolidation of departments. Excise, Stamps, and Taxes were at one time all administered separately, and the two latter employed each upwards of 300 officials, at aggregate salaries in either case of more than 60,0001. In 1834 they were united, with a saving of 50 officials and almost 20,0001. per annum. In 1849 the further step was taken of uniting also the administration of the Excise with that of the other two, and an additional saving of 30,0001. a-year was the result. Such are some of the features of the Inland Revenue as illustrated in the Report of its Commissioners, a document which any reader who wishes for more special details will find a most instructive compendium.
After the declaration of MIr.. Commissioner HoLRoYD, it is -difficult to conceive that Sir RICHARD BETHELL, the Attorney-General, can so completely set at nought the obligations of his office as to resist the appeal which has been made to him upon the Royal British Bank. Mr. WILLIAM Co?ncoGnAr plainly put the question last night to the Ax'rosNv-G;EpAL, " Is it your " intention to institute criminal proceedings " against these great criminals ? Ay or no I' From Sir RIcHAnD BETHEi's answer it is difficult to gather what his real intention may be. Now, what can be the motive of this reluctance? It is simply puerile to suppose that a man of the professional eminence of the present ATToRNEyGEiNER can have any personal object to answer which should induce him to stay proceedings in so serious *a matter. Sir RIcuARD BErHE%L has forty years of high character at his back;we dismiss any such supposition as unworthy even of a moment's discussion. But acquitting, as we do most entirely acquit, the ArronswyGENsRxL of any such imputation, it is difficult to understand why he should for a moment hesitate to use the powers which are placed in his hands for the public security. A man of his great ability can never give a moment's credence to the assertion which he himself made last night:-" Mly re"luctauce will be dne entirely to the reports and "statements which I find repeated, day by day in "the public newspapers, which would render it " almost impossible, where persons are in"dicted for an offence so ill-defined and so "elastic as that for which these persons can "alone, according to my personal apprehension, "be indicted, that they can be fairly tried "while the public mind remains in its present '"excited state." Does our whole judicial machinery, then, break down in the moment of trial? Of coumrP, a great crime, or even the imputation of a great crime, will always inspire a great Measure of public indignation, and GOD forbid that it should be otherwise, or in what a country should we be liViDg! But, according to the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, an offender is not to be brought to trial because the crime wherewith he is charged is such as to, rouse the emotions of all honest men to a keen inspection of the proceedings. Tht Sir RrcsAns calm his mind, and dismiss all apprehensions of an andue decision,. The difficulty here is not one of fact, but one Of law. Now, the fifteen Judges are not man. peculiarly liable to be swayed by transitory eanotiolsi, and the question is whether or no theDirector of the Royal British Bank have violated the tw.? : The- legal point is one rather for the IBench than for the jury. The Azron Gran should rmnem-, ber, too, that if he mer" to4 charges his coacience.- -with the responsibility of defering this. imqisiry, practically he, standing alone and rsetting Mit jnd-a ment or tis timidity against the coiv5ation and the resolition 'of the best crminal law3ers in the kingdom, acquits these criminals. : Now, Si 1ICHAD. BEUn is not the first cruinal lawyer in the kingdom. Eis fame deperds. upon his pre-eminence at the Equity Bar,-aurely enough to content the pride of any mr Why then auould he shrink from acknowl.edging that the prosecution of criminals is a r.atter with whieh he has not been conversant? EIe needs but to give an intimation of his Iecision, and he can command the assistance of t'ae highest professional saill which the country can afford. We repeat once more that this is 'ne of the two or three occasions in a man's life when his fame is made or marred. It is one OÃ¯Â¿Â½ the occasions on which the ArronEswY-GnxmuA 'must do his duty at any cost.

Instructions have been issued by the navy squadron to tho East India squadron to proceed to Fbormosa and investigate the circumstances attending the wreck of the American ship Highflyer and the supposed murder of her crew.

A "legraphio deapatch from Madridannounco that M. Lrua, the Mexican Envoy, arrived there yesterday. He had this morning an audience of the ister for Foreign Affairs I have already mentioned the probability of a pacific arrangement of the quarrel between the two Government. The tatst; despatches received by M. Lafragun from Mexico were of a satisfactor Idnd, und I have little doubt that, as a favourable disposition exist on both sides, zealously encouraged by the English and French Ambassadors at Madrid, the affair will be terminated amicably. In that oc the greater part of the troops sent out to the Gulf w11 be kept at Cuba to strengthen the garrisons of that isld. A private letter from Madrid, of the 9th, gives the following particauars relative to the project of reconciliation between the Spanish Bourbons - " Tho Count do Montemolin appeared disposed to recognize thO legtUimacy of Q(een Igabella, hls cousin, on condition that he himself shall bo recognised as Infanto of Spain; that he shall ba Indaemnfied for the property belonging to his 0thur, which wns confiscated; tlat the arreas duo sh be paid up; and that he shall be paid a yearly allowanco cor2esponding to his rank as a Spanish Princae On thes conditions he will acknowledge the authority of the Queen, and thus admit the injustice of the war which his father waed agains her. There isno doubt thatlthese tems were not accepted at the Palace. He had an assurance to that effect from the King, who bas written to him en severl occadsons, and who, some affirm, has sent him money, either on account of his claim or as a grtuitous 6i. This project of reconciliation was first opened by the Government some months ago, and the Spanish Minister at Naple was written to, and requested to push It on. The consent of Don Juan, the brother of the Count de Monte. molin, had been previously obtained; be declared that he should adhere to the wishes and abide by the orders ot his brother, his sovereign, and the chief of his family. The matter was dropped for some time, and now tho Government recoil from the responsibility of so a-Vs a measure. But, if they hesitate or stop short there are others who urge it vigorously, namely, Russia aldod by the Spanish Court, the King of Naples' and the Pope. The motive that actuats Russia and Rome is tho restoration of despotism and legitimacy. As) fo, tho King of Naples, besides these advantages, he is most desirous of bringing about the recognition of Quo-an Isablla in order to rid himself of the inconvenient and troublesome guesta he has on his hands-the Count de Montemolin and his wifo, Don Sebastian and his wife, and their suites Two diffioulties have, however, recently arisen, and which must be removed before proceeding any further. Don Juan now refuses to adhere to the plan, notwithstandlng his promise to submit to the orders of his brother. The CQurt of Naples is afflicted at this change of disposition, but with the aid of Russia the Court of Madrid, and tho Pope, there is every reason to believe that the difficulty will bh removed. The more serious obstacle will probablyproceed fmm the Cortes. Tho law restoring to the Count do Monte. molin his titlo and rank, his indemnity, and his allowance as TInte of Spain, will have to be presented to the Cortes and voted by them. No7, though the present Chambers are cer. tanlyanythingbutindependent,enad uchasthegreaternumbor is composed of employ&z, I much doubt if they will tak5 upon themselves the responsibility of a measue which would be likely to plunge Spain anew into civil war. In whatever point Of view we examine it, the affir is one of grave import. Moreover, it is in the Interest of France and England to counteract the designs of Russia in the South. These designs show the necessity of fortifying the Western alliance, the alliance of England with France, with Spain, nd with Liberal Itoly; and until itbat is done the North will be a menace and a danger against the West. So far as t-he Spanish people are in question, I am not quite sure whether they would not prefer the Duke de Montpensier, or even the Republic, to having the Carlist, lck again. I have said that the Cortes would very probably Offer opposition to these projects, but you know in vvhat little esteem they are hold at the Palac. A Liberal Cortes always keep the Court in check-a Cortes like the presnt is looked upon as a Ministerial bureau. Now that the Chambers are opened, we shall soon see the selfecalled Moderado3 divided into fractions, and waging war against each other with a vir4lence which belles their name, but which is their great characteristic." A French telegraphic despatch from Malta of the 12th mnentions that Admiral Lyons was to leave that iand about the 12th inst.; that he was to proceed Vith the Royal Albert and other ships of the cquadron to Palermo, and other porbs of Sicily; thence to Algiers and Tunis; and, after havmng visited the coast of Barbary, would return to Portfmnouth. By an Imperial decree in the Moniteur, dated Fontainebleau, the 12th, the session of the Legilative Body, which was to have closed on Saturday, is prolonged to the 28th inst. inclusive. A letter from Marseilles, of the 13th inst., anfounces the arrival there that day of the King of Bavaria, on board a Neapolitan frigate, accompanied by General Roberti, an Aide-de-Camp of the King of Naples. The King, who was to leave MarseiUe on Thursday, for Paris, travels incognito. The Neapolitan frigate exchanged salutes with the forts. The Polish General Zamoiski had arrived at Marseilles from Constantinople; MX Lavalette de Montbrun, French Consul in Persia, and Monsigneur PeU1erin, Vicar-Apostolic in China, had arrived from Alexandria. Advices from Nice, of the 12th inst., mention that all the Russian Imperial Family had left, except the Grand Duchess Helena, who remained for sea-bathing. The Empress Dowager and the Grand Dukes had distributed snuffboxes, ornamented with portraits set in large diamonds. They ikewise presented rings, bracelets, or other trinkets, to everybody who came in contact with them. The Empress, though she received but little company, spent at least 100,000f. a-week. The Moniteur de la Flotte atates that the Russians are founding a great maritime establishment on the river Amoor, which they call Port ImperiaL Port Imperial is about 130 miles to the south of the Bay of Castries, in 48 degres 58 minutes north latitude, and 140 degrees 17 minutes east longitude. The remains of the frigate Pallas, which the Russians sunk to save her from falling into the hauds of the English, are still to be seen in the north-west part of the port. Two powerful batteries are bemg erected at this spot. The naval establishment of Port Imperial is to comprise factories, dry docks, large storehouses, powerful means of defence, and all the requisites for sheltering a large fleet It is announced that, in oonsequence of a scientific oonvention, the Imperial observatory of Paris, which publishes a daily account of the temperature throughout France, will apply its system of obser vations to all Europe. The Powers who have acceded to this convention are, it is said, Great Britain, Austria, Russia, Prassia, Sardinia, Spain, Bavaria, Rome, and Wurtemberg. We shaU know daily in Paris the temperature throughout Europe. The Grand Duke Constantine is expected at Paris to-night, to have the freedom of the town In complete incognito. His Imperial Highnems' popularity has not increased with the army, any more than with the people. He visits the barrack and makes inspections dre sed as a civilian or in undress uniform (petit tenue), while the generals, officers, and men receive him in ful military costume. HTe ha, perhaps, no intention o offiending, but it looks as if he did not think it worth while to observe even ordinary attentions towards them Dr. Kern, the Swiss Plenipotentiary, has been invited to Fontsinebleau. The heart of the Queen of Weetphalia the second qfe of Prince Jerome Bonaparte, and moth er of Prince Napoleon and the Princess Mathilde, endlosed in an urn, has been deposited in the tomb of the Emperor Napoleon, at the Invalides.

Between 6 and 7 o'clock this morning the Emperor, wvith the Archdukes William and Leopold, arrived from Peeth. The Empress ws also expected, but the journey would have been too fatiguing for her, as MEi iajestY will return to the Hungaran capital in the course of the afternoon. Soon after. 10 odclock the Emperor drove out to the Augarten, and it may safely be foretold that the Agricultural Exhibition will far surpass his expectations. Vienna, which is always full at this seasou of the year, is now crowded to excess, as great numberg of foreigners have come to the Exhibition. Almost all the persons who arrive from the various Austian provinces are compelled to claim the hospitality of their friends, as the foreign public a few days ago took posesion of every room that waS to be had in the hotela The streets leadin to the Augarten are almost as thronged as Fleet-street and Cheapaide are at noonday, and above 150,000 persons vwited the Eihibition on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Various members of the Imperial family pass a great part of each day in examining the various objects exhibited, and one of the most constant visitors is the E;mpress-Mother, the widow of the late Emperor Fanis. According to the Ost-Deutsche Post, Her MTajesty converses frequently with the Tyrolese, some of whom having been at the Paris Exhibition have long tales to tell of what they said to the Emperor and Empress of the French, and what those high personages said to them. The maniold picturesque costumes of the attendantG-male and female-strike the foreign visitor greatly, but the Austrians are so accustomeed to them that they hardly attract their notice. Yesterday SiX firms exhibited the powers of their thrashing machines, each of which was worked by Its own loco-robie. In the opinion of the public, the machines of Messrs. Davy, of Sheffield, and Olayton, of Lincoln, performed their work most expeditiously and neatly. An Auwtrian machine, made by Weisse, of Prague and Temesvar, after an English model, thrashed 31 sheaves in three minutes. To-day the mowing machines and ploughs are being tried. The Hungarians have-been authorized to establish an Hungarian Agrioultural Society, and the Emperor sanctioned its statutes about a week ago. On the 9th a serenade was given to their Majestes by torchlight. The proceeaion, which went from Pesth across the euapenEion brndge to the palace at Buda, was thuscomposed-a military band, the BudsPeath Society of le Singers (Minner-GesangsVerein), the Magistrate and Oommon Council of the two cities, the notables, the bankers and merchants, a militaryband, and the other corporations and guilds. In the rear was a third bandL All the persons forming the procesion, with the exception of the mausicians and singers, were in full dress and carried burning torche. The Court remained on the balcony of the palace during the whole of the serenade, which consisted of the national anthen and an Hungarian and German chorus. In the mornling of the 10th there was what is technically called a " church parade,"* and in the evening a ball was given by the aunicipality of Luda in honour of their Ma!esties. Yesterday morning there was a musical festival in the Conservatorium at Pesth, and a bal was announced for the evening. The Fremde Blatt has recelved telegraphic ina formation from Szegedin that Rosza Sander, the Rinaldo Rinaldini of Hungary, on whoee head there is a price of 10,000 forins, has fallen into the hands of the authorities. Their Majesties were to begin their tour in Hungary in a day or two, but their departure from Pesth may perhaps be delayed, as some of the rivers have overfowed their banks. A person, who was at Milan while their Majesties were there, writes from Peath that the Empres produces just as favourable an impression on the EHungarians as she did on the Italians. The Magyaxs appeartobegreatlyflattered that she so frequently wear. the national costume, and " beautiful Hungarian lady l," is a favourite exclamation among the lower elasses. If the ne which we receive from Lombardy be correct the new Governor-General is likely to be as popular with the Milanese as an Austrian Prine possibly can be. In the evening of the 3d inst. there was a drawing-room, at which several Italian ladies were present who had long absented them. selves from the palace. After all the ladies had been introduced to him, the Archduke offered his arm to the oldest of them, and led the way into one of the smaUer State apartments, which had been fitted up as a theatre. The dramatiM repreEentations were in the French language. Aftar the theatre the guests partook of refresments, which were served by footmen powdered and dresed a l'Anglaise. The ladies were presented by the Duches Melzi, whose husband is one of the Chamberlains of his Imperial Highness. The Governor-General sometimes appears in plain clothes, and his doing so is a proof that he knows what is to the taste of the people. Last night Prince Charles of Prussia arrived here, but it is not known whether he left Berlin in order to get out of the way of Prince Napoleon, or whether he was really desirous to see the Agricultural Exhibition. Persons who know the political opinions of the Prussian Prince believe that he has made the Vienna fete an excuse for leaving the Prussian capital. Some members of the Vienna Society of St. Severin, who a short time ago went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, fell into the hands of the spoilers in the neighbourhood of Nazareth, and were not permitted to continue their journey until they had transferred their valuables from their own pockets to those of the children of the soiL The ungodly Viennese do not attempt to conceal their satisfaction that the lay Jeauits have met with such a midventure. Professor Simonds, who has been sent by the British Government to examine into the murrain which is raging in Gallicia and Moravia, is now at Lemberg. M. G. Nildas, one of the professors of the Veterinary College at M-nich, has also been s -nt there b re bavarian Government. If Mr. Simonds understands Germa well he will be able to collect a vast deal of valuable information In Austria, but if not he might almost as well have remained on the other side of the Channel. In a letter headed Indian Mails," which appeared in The Times of the 9th of By, is a pasxsge which is not exactly correct. The writer (M G. Buist) says *- " The railways- both to Mrseilles and Trieste have been for two years in operation, so that we can look for little more than we at present enjoy in the way of speed to Alexandria" At the end of July the Laibach-Trieste part of the SouthernRailradwill be opened, and thejourey between TrieBte and Viemna will be some eight hours shorter than it ix at preseDt. That the bestandidhorteat wayfrom Alexandriato England is byTrieste is a fact which admits of no dispulte. During the last few years the Lloyd steames from Alexandria have never failed to bring English officer, on their way home from India to England. PRUSSIA. (F s OUR OVrN 0oo EsPoiDET.) BERLIN, MAY 12. The present sesson of the Prussian Diet s in a very bad way indeed, it has lasted now five months and a-half, and it has hardly trength enough left to finish its work; it is too old to live and too week to die. After rejecting all the important measures thattheGovernmonthad brouht in, the two Houses are now higgling with each other as to what smaU amount of a petty bil for taxation shall be vouchsafedto the Goternment as a sop to prevent its bein too angry. The House of Notables has passed a Bill for making certain alterations -in the taxation of perstons carrying on trade, but deprved it of the most important clause; the i Bill has come down to the House of Deputies, who had previously shown themselves more compliant, and had swallowed a much laiger amount of the Ministerial dose; and yesterday the worthy deputsss, with indefatigable amiability, restored to the Bill, the clause that the Notables had struck out, though in a somewhat modified form. The consequence is, the measure must go back to the House of Notables for fresh discusion, and the session, whlch would otherwise have been closed to-day, or to-morrow at the latest, must linger on a fewc days longer, although everybody, Ministers, Presidentb, Notablea and Dleputies, and the " public fin general," are heartily sick of the debates and long for their termination. The President of the House of Notables has already communicated to the House a statement of the amount of work that has been done; the House hoped it had closed its account with this session, but destiny and the deputies will not allow it as yet to depart this present life and this town. It ia therefore quite possible that the House of Notables, if there be atill a sufficient number of members available to make a House, Fill reject the cluse that the other House is trying to force upoit, and will thus bring about the rejection of thewholeBilL In this case allthe financial measures of the Govermnment will have been thrown out except one for taxing joint-stock companies, and that ought also to havo been rejected for the very clumsy and injudicious course it proposes to take. Whenever the two Houses do contrnve to bring their labour, to a close the final ceremony of proroguing them will not take place in the White Saloon of the Palace as usual, inasmuch as workmen are engaged there reparng and beautifying; it is presumed, therefore, that some other lange apartmnent of the Palace wrill be used on this occasion for the nonce. Yesterday, after the parade at Potadam, the King and Queen took their Imperial guest out driving for the purpose of showing himthe beautiesof Pot"dam, after which they all embarked on board the steamboat that usually lies at anchor on the Havel or some one of the lakee, ready for use, and paid a visit to the Paueninsel. The Princoe, on returning to Berlin yesterday afternoon, dined in his own apart ments in the Palace, and proceeded in the evening to the assembly held at the Marcuis de Moustier's. It is presumed that his Imperial highness will, after the conclusion of his military inspections to-day, vsit the new Museum and the numerous objects of art that are deserving attention in this town. The Austrians, who feel that the first raturn visit paid by Prince Napoleon ought by rights to have been paid to Vienna in return for that of the Archduke Ferdinand of last aummer, maintain that there must have been some dep political object to induce the Emperor Louis Nap;Foeoo overlook this manfeat consideration and despatch his cousin first to Berlin. They believe that the Grand Duke Constantine's visit In Paris has given riAe to this deviation from strict etlquette, though not to driving the Prince away from Paris, as people assume; on the contrary, that the object of his visit here is to further a plan, long arranged and chiefly promoted by BaronVonSeebach,for bringing a.bout a meeting of the Emperors of France and Russia with the King of Prussia in the capital of his Royal master's dominions, Dresden. The matrimonial projects of the Prince are supposed, at any rate for the present, to be perfectly subordinated to the above-mentioned grand project of a meeting of monarchs; for, though the choice of the French Court is believed to lie between a Bavarian and a Saxon Princess, that choice has as yet by no means been settled. It will be found in harmony with either of these projects that the Queen of Prussia starts to-day or to-morrow for Dresden. It should, however, be borne in mind, at the same time, thlat Her Majesty was on the point of leaving here to visit her sister, the Queen of Saxony, when the intended visit of Prince Napoleon was announced here last week. Another smaU event that may be made use of by those who are fond of "putting this and that together" is, that the French Minister at Dresden, M. de Forth-lRouen, also arived here to-day. BiY 13. The new p-qjet de lZo for making some alterations in the taxation of persons carrying on trade was sent up again yesterday to the House of Notables, with the clause they had previously rejected restored to it by the :ouse of Deputies. By dint of unusual dligence as committee meeting was held on it at once, so that it came on yesterday for deliberation in the House, and w:ith the 1083 of very few words the contested clause was again rejected; on this the Mdinister of Finance rose, and said that aftr the rejection of this, the most vital and inportant portion of the measure, and in the improbability of any agreement being come to between the twro Houses on this point, the Government would withdraw the bill. (This unsatisfactory option and alternative the Government has been obliged to adopt this session a great many tlmes) No sooner was this over than the Minister President read to the House a mesage from the King, authorizing him to close the sesion, which accordingly took place the same day-viz., yesterday afternoon, at 4 o'clock, in the Elizabeth Saloon of the Palace. This apartment, although a very handsome and spacious one, was by no means suited to the ceremony to be observed in it, for, although the throne and canopy and various state chairs had been brought into it, the other arrangements bore a very improvised character. The main body of the room was occupied with chairs for the members, of whom about 150 were present; while small portions were marked off by red cords at two corners for the Corps Diplomatique and the reporters for the press; the diplomatists assembled there to the large number of three, while the State chairs for the Royal Princes remained as empty as the throne itself, only the latter had tho advantage of being covered. The speech which the Minister President read to the members present was too long and too little interesting for insertion in your columzns; in one paragraph, however, he summed up the more important events of the session, and that one I will give you. After enumerating the various measures of small importance which the two Houses had passed, he added- " The grave and thorough discussion which the House O' Deputies bestowed on the bill for altering the existing w of divorce has shown that it fully recognized the real necessity of a roform in this branch of the law, and neverthelens no corresponding result has been arrived at *ith regard to that projeS de o With reference also to various important financial measures no agreementhas beencome to. It is true the budget that has been broughtforward for thecurrentyear has been passed without any alteration, after thorough discussion, and thus the approval of the Diet has been extended to the economical, and as yet Tery circumscribed, outlays of the Administration. It is further true, gentlemen, that the proposals for the application of the remaining balance of the extraordinay credit of 30,000,000 thalers, amcorded to the Administration of the army, have also received your sanction, and this sanction and consent have also been extended to the bill for levying a tax on joint-stock companies, &a. On the other hand, there has been no satisfactory reult obtained with reference to the bill for imposing a duty on all buildngs and tenements, for restoring the former price of salt, and for maldng some alterations in the Owerbesieuer (tax on persons carying -on trade). His Majestys Governmn,: submitted those bills to you inthe convictiontht the objec.: tions entertained against an increased stain being put on the tax-paying powers of the land were not so weighty as to relieve them from the duty of proposing the necessary ways and means for meeting the amply recognized necesities of the administration of the State; these neoway means, His Majesty' Government is convinced, are neither to be found in the existng revenues nor in the natural extndon of its Xeceip*--.at any rate, not to a sufficlenientxent." No sound of approbation or disapprobation, or even of interest, was audible during the whole reading of the speech, which conveyed nothing to the hearers but what tiey knew perfectly well already; it contained no allusion to foreign politics, and the only indication of what course the Government intended to pursue in financial matters, the rock on 'Which it has split this seesion, was conveyed in the final aentence, to this effect_ " His Majeist Goverent ias convinced that it wi only be acting faithfuuly to the traditions of th countes his. tow,snd the character of tlhe Prusia Administion as legibly portrayed there, by oontinuing to unie a_ anxious solicitude for tke frthLerance of a rapid devolopaient of the nAtioU&I propenity with the careful observanee of sir. Mnspeot ononiy." Wlha' i wA sl Qover, andtheod et Qf tbL I - m'ane Service Xi 1!erfonned in a uare formed by the troop. At the elavato nof the Hoat'%1 uin a dia* of artilley. House of Notables had got up a cheer for the King, the members shook hands with suchof their acquaintances as were near them, and separated so rapidly and samn fafo that no stranger passing through the courtyards of the pala, oroverthe Schlons Platz, within five minutes ot that final cheer, could ever have guessed that the session of the Legislative Body bad just been brought to a closa, and that, too, a ession that will in future yeas be referred to aa the commencemert of a newr era in Prusia,-a sesaion in which a Parliamentary constitution first became a reality, and first gave an lndication of its possibly in future years beacoming a blessing to the country. On arving at the practising ground of the itfanthl of this garriuon yesterday Prince Napoleon first mspected the targets erected there, and then the practice with the z mitndeM rifle and the Minie' rife commenced; from the few remarks I have heard it appears to me as if the results wsith the latter had been the more satlsfactor,y of the twro. More particula;rly was this the case with the firing of combustible projectiles from the Minie rifle, by which at arangaeof from 150 to 400 paces (a pace is 2 feet 2 inches English) the contents of an ammunition waggon were always exploded, if not at the first shot, always within the third. This practice with small arms had been preceded by a field-day of infantry, cavalry, and artillery combined. On returning to town from the Hasenhaide the Prince viited the museums and tho various other objects of interest here. In the afternoon he dined with the King, who on this occasion departed from his usual early dinner hour, perhaps also for the purpose of giving his Ministers time to finish the little matter of business they were tranmsting in another part of the Palace-viz, the closing of the leWaitive session in time to appear at the Etoyal table. In the evening everybody was at the Opera again, as they have been everynight except M1onday; and to-day the King and Princes, with *eir guest, are off again to Potsdam to be present at another field-day. Either to-morrow or Friday the Prince is to leave here and go on to ])readeu, whither the Queen proceedod yesterday. -This al throw additional probability upon the twofold presumptfon, that a meeting is to be brought about, if posible, between the four Monarchs, the Emperors of France and Russia and the Kxings of Prusia and Saxony, and, secondly, that Prince Napoleon is oontemolating a matrimonial alliance with a Saxon Princess. It may be borne in mind that his own mother Ws a Princess of Wurtemberg. The blind that will be thrown out to cover his visit to the Saxon capital will, I have no doubt, be a desire expremed by his Imperial Highness to visit the battle-fields of Bautzen and Leipsio-a very likely subject of interest to a Frenchman and a nepheow of the conqueror who met wMit his first check and defeat there. At the Marquis de Moustier's baUl on Monday night, at which the King, Queen, and Royal Family were present, the Prince wore for the first time the Order of the Black Eagle, which had been presented to him the preceding day at (harlottenburg.
LADY FRANXiUes ExPnDm oN.-The screw Bteamer Fox is now on the slip at Aberdeen, and boing doubled by the Messrs. Hall to strengthen her for the last expdition to the Arctic regions. This fine vessel wsa built only three yeas ago as a pleasure-yacht for the late Sir Richard Satton, and cost with her fitting about 5.000l.; the ves.el was used by Sir Richard chiefly in the Baltio during the late war, and on his decease was dismantled, and offered for ale at Aberdeen. 3.0001. were offered for the yacht and refused, but when the trustee of Sir Richard were apphed to, with a view to a purchas on behalf of Lady Fral in, they cheerfully sold the ship for 2,000. in consideration of the obiect, for which she was strongly recommended by her builder. The Fox is built on the diagonal principle, and Is getting a doubling of African teak, between which and the outer ekin of the first finish there is a thick covering of felt. The ship is now so well padded,as well as tlmbered and planked, that it seoms as If she would standulr amount of mre, and from her izeable &menslons Is looked upon by Captain WCintook as being the best ship yet fitted out for the Arctic Regions. Tho Fox mesucrs 132 feet of extreme length, 25 feet of extreme breadth, with a depth of hold of 13 feet, and a draught of water of 11 feet The srew is being fitted with lifting gear, and the engines are of a very powerful character. The estimated oost of the shio, fittings up, &c., is about 5.OOOL, and the work is so far advanced that she will be ready for sea by he nd of June or beginnin_ of July The crew of the Fox will number 30 men sand flicers, most of them volunteers. They will be chiefly from the north of Scotland, and well accustomed to the hardships of an Arctic voyage. It is ptoposed by Captain WClintock to proceed by RegenYs Inlef, and thence through Bellot's Strait into the field of searcb, or go directly to it bT Peel's Strait if the iee permit. If neither of these plans be practicable, he will leave the Fox in Prince Begent's Inlet and undertake the search by iledging parties. Captain MWClintock has volunteered his servioes in a very dinnterested and chivalrous manner. He hm had great expenence in the Aretic reRions, having served under Sir =amesRoss in 184849, under Captain Austin in 1850-51, and had command of the screw steamer Intrepid in oompany with the Resolute in 1853, and has slpdged 4,000 miles Imore than any other investigator. He is sanguine of beinz able to accomplish the great object of the expedition, and confidently hopes to bring home some aocounts of the remains of the Erebus and Terror and their ill-fated compauies. The list of subscriptions towards this object now amounts to 1,50W - but it is understood that in order that she may be enable to meet all the expense Ldy Franklin has sold the property in Australia which belonged to her lute husband, and may thus be said to have psut all her fortun ISnto this last adventure of Arctic research.un A SosnE oF RTRIBWUIOx.-A picture representing the sale of a quantity of old furniture seized for rent was exhibited some years back in the window of a dealer in the Place de la Madeleine, and attracted considerable attention. In the foreground was placed a poor woman holding in her arms child, and watching with a sorrowful eye the progress of the sle. The sweet face of the child stood out in strong contrast to the distressed countenance of the poor mother. Further back were the personages connected with the sale, represented with great vigour. The following is stated by a Lyons journal to be the history of the scene depicted:-" A few years since, the painter of the picture in question, an eminent artist at Lyons, while passing through the Rue des Terreaux, approched anumber o persons who were gathered together, witnessing the sale of the fureture of a poor workman. A womn was seated on the pavement with a child in her arms. The painter spoke to her, and was told that the furniture which was beinR sold belonged t her; that ber husband bad died, leavin her with the child she held in her arms; that she had struggled hard to mantain heef by working day and night and submitting t every privation, but that her landlord had at length seized her furniture for some months' rent, which was due to him. The artist was much affected bythis simple recitl and inquired rho was her landlord? 'There he is,' replied the poor woman, pointing to a man who was watching the progress of the sale; and he was recognized by the painter as a person who wAs suspected of having amassed a considerable fortune by usury, so that to make any appeal to his feelings on behalf of the poor widow would be useless The artist was considering within himself what other plan he could adopt to benefit her, when the crier announced a picture for sale. It was a miserable daub, which in the summer the poor woman had used to hide the hole in the wall through which the pipe of the stove passed during the winter. It was put up at 1 franc. The artist at once conceived a plan for taking revenge of the landlord. He went over, examning the picture with great attention. andthen called out with a loud voice, 'Onehundredfrancs ' The landlord was astounded at the bid, but, conceivi that a picture for which so eminent an artist could offer tat sum was worth more than double, boldly offered 200f. ' Five hundred I' said the painter, and the contest between the two bidders became so animated that the prize was at length knocked down to the landlord at 2,D0f0 Th ^epurchaer, then addressing the painter, said, 'In seeing an artist of your merit bid so eagerly for the picture I supposed that it murst be valuable. Now, teU me, Sir, at what do you estimate its value ? ' About three francs and a-half,' replied the pinter, ' but I would not 'ive that for it.' 'You are sure y jesting' sid the landlord, ' for you bid as high as 2.1 00t. for it. ' That is true,' replied the artist, ' and I will tell you why I did so. You, who are in posesion of an income of 25,000. a-year, have seized on the furniture of a poor woman for a debt of 200f. I wished to I oua lesson, and you fell into my trap. Instead o the poor woman being your debtor, she is now your creditor, and I flatter myself you will not compel her to seize on your furniture for her debt.' The artist then politely sauted the astonished landlord, aud having announced her good fortane to the poor woman walked away." ASSATuTS o w Wom? .-By a new Bill of Mr. Dilwyn, Mr. Bentinck, and Lord Raynham, the late Act for punishing assault on women and children of an aggravated nhature is repealed, and magistrates are empowered to .sentence the rnffians committina uch outrages to imprisonment for two calendar months, with or without hard labour, and to order them (if males) to be once privately whipped, in addition to such imprisonment, without power of appeal to the quarer sessions. The Act is oonfined to England.

MONZYZ7MARKETuAWITrYIxrz?IwLLRa0. The funds this morning again opened withi gret steadines, but a severe presure for loax on dock andEixchequer-bills, coupled with the arival of Unfavourable rates of exchange from China, cauxed a re-action of nearly three-eighths per cent., from which there was only a partial recovery. ConDols for money were first quoted 94 to is and after having touched 93i they left off at 93i to 94 for money, and 949 for the 4th of June. In the early part of the dasy the rate for advances on Government securities was 7 per cent., but only small amounts were attracted to the market, and it then went to 8 per cent., at which a large sun was lent for a few days upon Consols by one of the jointstock banks. It is a remarkable circumstance that the sudden requirements which created such extraordinary signs of difficulty are understood not to have exceeded 150,0001. The operations of the public during the day again consisted principally of sales, while the disposition of the speculators was to effect purchases. About 150,000l. or 200,0001. was said to have been drawn from the Baik, in sovereigns, for transmission to Scotland, and this may have had an important effect in contributing to the increase of preure. Bank Stock cloed at 212 to 214; Reduoed, 921 to iNer Three per Cnts, 921 to i'; ludiatock, 220 to 222; idia Bonds, 8L to 4s. discount; and Exchequer.bonds, 98i to 1. The Government brokers continued their purchase of Exchequer-bills, and the last quotations were, June, par to 3. premium; March, Is. to Sx. premium. In the discount-market and at the Bank of England there was increased activity. Foreign securities were very firm at the commencement of business, but subsequently became weak. In Turkish Six per Cents., for money, the operations were at 95i aud 95, and for the account, at 95X, J and J. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed wee negotiated at00o and 100 for money, and at 101k, i- and 101 for the account.

Certificates, 97i. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Amsterdam, Paris, and Vienna were a shade higher than last post. Hamburg and the other principal places wrer about the same. The final quotations of the French Three per C1ents on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 35c. for money, and 69f. 55c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration. The corn-market was again duU to-day, at the decline of Monday. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business and an advance I of 1-16d. per lb. Small amounts of gold continue to betaken to the Bank The Batk of France returns for the past month confirm the anticipation expressed in the Paris letters a few days back, that the stock of buUion would show no material alteration. Although the amount purchased at artificial prices during the period has been one-third less than that in the previous month, it has been nearly sufficient to meet such drain as still continues, the total now held being 9,333,0004, or within 70,0001. of the total last published. As there is always a considerable internal demand for coin at this season, arising from the wants of the silk cultivators in the south, these figures are comparatively satisfactory, especially as there has concurrently been a contraction of 460,0001. in the note issues. The deposits of the public show an increase of 280,0001., and those of the Government &09,0001. There has consequently been a greater ability to grant discounts, and a further augmentation of 560,0001. is exhibited under that head. The advauces on stocks and shares continue limited, the former presenting an augmentation of only 30,0001., and the latter a reduction of 32,0001. The premium paid for purchaes of bu.ion during the month has been 10 0001., against 16,0001. in the preceding return. WPe telegraphic quotations of the rates of exchange from India and China to-day caused disappointment, since they will give a new imnulse to theshipment of silver. The Indian ratea do not show any positive variation, but it was hoped that the large arrivals of specie both at Bombay and Calcutta would have caused another downward movement. There has been a rise at Shanghai and Singapore of 5 per cent. and at Hlongkong of 3 per cent., and the result is that aU the silver in the London market which could be obtained at yesterday's price has been bought up; that an advance of id. to id. per ounce is now demanded; and that the remittances by the packet of the 20th, which it was'at one time thought would not exceed 300,0001., are now likely to amount to 500,0001. It is to be observed, however, that the Chinese rates are not of so much importance as the Indian, and, consequently, that the shipments are not likely to assume the magnitude that would be witnessed if there were again an unfavourable turn in the latter. It Is also considered that, although the rise at Shanghai has been occasioned by the silk houses drawing as much as possible to provide means at an earlier period than usn for malingthe new purchases of the season, the firms on this side, by whom 1,300,0001. has been sent out since January, will not be tempted by the present rates to ship any additional quantity on speculation, but will wait to receive advices as to the effect that may slready have been produced. They will also be gaided by the reports of the crop in France and Italy. The principal sums to be despatched will therefore most likely be in connexion with banking and ordinary exchange operations. Stil these may be very large, since the demand appears to be as active in the Indian Arehipelago as in China. At Manilla, owing to the purchases of sugar on Europeau account, it has been particularly manifested, an amount of nearly half a million sterling having been drawn to that island from the surrounding places during the month proceding the date of the last mail. The Chinese advices state the export of tea to date at 53,700,000lb., and of silk 64,653 bales. Prices of both articles were high. The exchange had advanced at Hongkong from 4s. 9iLd to 4s. lld., and at Shanghai from 6s. 7id. to 6s. lid. There was no political change, as Admiral Seymour was still waiting the arrival of troops. In the produce-markets during the week there has been general steadiness, and stocks in most caus exhibit a further diminution, the easterly winds still delaying arrivals at this port. The demand for sugar appears to have received a check by the further sudden advance of 2s. to Ss. established at the public sales in the early part of last week, and where importers met the buyers Is. under the extreme rates then obtained has been accepted. The general postion of the market is still, however, favourabro to holders, the latest returns again showing a important falling offw in the quantities held, owing to remarkably large clearances for consumption, combined with light receipts. The Dutch Trading Company's sale of Java, on Monday, will comprise about 25,000 tons, and the result is lookred forward to wlth more than the usual degree of interest. There ha been some animation in coffee, prices of all descriptions closing rather firmer. Some speculative business is reported in Ceylon of native growth, good ordinary quality bringing 63s. to 6s, Four cargoesof Rioand two of St.Domingohave'been taken for near ports at about former quotations, Rice remains steady. The clearances for export still prooeed upon a very extensive scale, and the stock is now reduced to a moderate compass Nothing of interesthas transpired in spioe. Rum is unaltered. There hla been a better feeling in the sltpetre-market, owing to the revival of speculative inquiry at Liverpool, combined with the aosnce of further indirect imports and the comparatively limited stock on hand here. The quarterly sales of East India indigo, which commen6ed on Tueasdy, have thus fa gone off at 2d. to 6d. under the rates obtained in the January series, excepting for rood to fine shipping Klurpah Madras, which met with a spirited competition. Notwithstanding the limited attendanceo obuyers, alargeproportion of thequantity pasaed haa been did of. In tea there is arely any speculation, but a fair demand exists on the part of the trade for most descriptions. Green teas ae offered niore freely, and in seme instane'e3 have been sold at a reduction. There are buyer,. of common Congon at Is.

STATS O TRADE.-MANCHESTER, May 15.-The market has shown little, if any, improvement this morning. the sales of cloth having been on a very limited scale and prices being maintained with difficulty, though there is more steadiness than last week. The difficulty of making sales applies to nearly all Classes of cloth. In yarns there is rather more business. There are no important sales in any one class, but the demand applies to most kinds of mule and water, both for home consnmption and export. 2BRISTOL SUGAR-IARKET, Friday, May 15.-About 200 hhds. Barbadoes, the Iast in first hands, have found buyers this week, rtly at adechme of Is. per cwt., and privately some parceisor arrival are spoken of, the exact particular of w ;ih have not transpired. The market is certainly quiet, as might indeed be expected after the late excitement, but there are few or no sellers at the decline noted, -which, however, can onily be of temporary duration, Rhe refined market bes slso been quiet, but, as the manufac. turers have nothing ready to offer, quotations are un=atered.

But from this mnt be deducted 591., the de eas on the Lon. don and Blackwnll, and 1,6841. on the London and South-Western, lhaving the increase as bove 2,5301. The receipts on the other lines in the united ldng_ dom amo,uted to 270,1081., and for the corresponding period of 186 to 247,2161., showing an increase of 2,8921. in X l rceipts of those line,, which, added to tho increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 25,4221. as compared with the corresponding week of 1856. The followin are t receipts of railwaYs for the past week - LEOMfSTER AND 1IGTON. It appars that this line is to be opened for goods and pa. senger trafc on the 16th of July next. The line is a single one, through an easy country, abounding in hops, fruit, and other agricultural produce. It runs from the Shrawsbury and Hereford line at Leominster to Kington. The Govern. ,nent inspector will, it is expect, make his official inspec. tion at the end of June. MO[TOUTHSHIRE. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts on revenue amcount for the half-year ending th 31ht of December last alnounted to 57 9261., exceeding those of the correspondingperiod of 1855 by 4,5251. The working expenses amounted to 31,2311., or 54 per cent., against 35,0691., or 65i percent., in 1855, leaving a profit on the working of 26,6951., against 18,3-32Z. at the corresponding period of 1855. The baance on general revenue account, after paying the interest on debentures, preforence shares, and outstanding debts, and the other charges, amounted to 10,3921. The committee recommend a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares, payable on the 30th of June next, leaving a balanee of 1,9421. for tho next account. The committee congratulate the shareholders on the improvement in the dividends during the last three half-years, being at the rate of 3 per cent., 4 per oent., and 6 per cent. per annum repectively. The reserve fund now amounts to 6,bO0f. After a careful examination of the share and loan accounts they have been found correct. The new depot at Newport for locomotive engines has been completed. The improvements in the Western Valleys Railways at Risca, Sewbridge, and Victoria are completed, and the committee would have proceeded with the otber deviations and imn provements on these railways if the remainder of the share capital authorized by the Act of 1855, had been subscribed. Since the last half-yearly report 1,112 only of those shares, representing 33,6601., have been taken, and there now remain 1,151 shars, representing 34,5301., unissned. These shares are entitled to interest at 5 per cent, per =nnumn in ,erpeity, in priorty of dividenlds on the ordinary shares. The railways and cana are reported to be in a good state of repair.

ZreanT homas and Mr. Charnock appeared for the aintiff; and Mr. Sereant Shee, Mr. Petersdorff and Mr. Mok Evawfor th'e defenaant3. The plaintift in thtin acion, George Trevis was formerly a clerk in tho goods depatmeitocf the South-E astern Railway Company at the Bricklayes Arms etation, and he sued the company and Mr. Well, the caihier in thesame depaternb, to recover damages for the conversion of foar letters of It appeared that in the month of September, 1855, the caghier of the company, Mr. Wells, introduced the pin. tiff to a situation as Clerk in his office. He told him to bring his teimoniA intimating that if they were satisfactory to Mr. Shaw, the goods manager, he would probably obtain an appointment. The plintiff accordinly handed him four letters, one of which spoke of seven and a half 7ears' servicoe in connexion with tho London and Brighton Railway and another spoke of two yers service under the londonaerry and Colera,ine Company. The next morning Wells told the plaintiff that the testioniaT were satisfactory, and that he ws engaged at 27s. 6d. a-week. It was the custom of the oompany to return the testimonials, and Wells told the plnt he would do so. Wells accordagly put them in a 9rerwr in the offce where such things were kept. On the 28th of April 1856, the plaintiff rcie notice to quit his service on the loth of Maty, the pgound stated being that the company were making reductions in their estab men' Th'e m er at the same time ex- ressed his good wishes for the pintiffs success, and hoped ne would soon get an equally good or better situation. On the 3d of June the plaintiff a pplied to the defendant Wells for his testimonials, and wastold by him that Mr. Shaw, the i = ager, had1them in his office. WhenheappliedtoShaw, herrs told that Shawknewnothink aboutthem, and, though every search was made for them t hey could never be found. A corespondence was read, which showed that previous to October aha plaintiff had obtained copies of a portion of his testimoni, mad demanded compensation for the loss which he said he had sustained by being kept several weeks out of a situation for want of *e documents, At this stage of the proceedings Mr. JusiHe Cos.srno said h culd not see any evidence of a converalon either by the oompapy or by Well;. Mr. Serjeant THo3as then called the dWendiat Wells, and he stted that, after the plaintiff had been for nome time in the company' employ, a superior situatlon became vaant in the Royal Swedish Railway, and th&t he (Well) asked the laintiff if he would lke to take it. The plaintiff said ne would if the slay was satisfactory. Wells then sid it would be neceary for him (Wells) to let Mr. Shaw have the testimonial to show to the manTer of the Swedish Railway, and that the plaintiff e should thank him to do no. Wells accordingly handed the testimonialsto Shaw, and had never seen them since. Bhaw was also called for the plaintiff, and he confirmed the evidence of Wells as to the Swedish Railway, but added that It became unnecessary to show any testimonials to the Swedish maager, ag the vacancy was otherwie sapphed. He said he did not recollect that he' had ever received them from Wells, though he could not say that he had not. However, he had made all possible search for them but without succes. He was theefore induoed bythe plntiffto write two letters to the BrIghton and Londonderry Rawanys, to get copies of the orignals, and it appeared that the paintiff had n consequenco received one testimonial from the Bneghton Company, extend ye and a half out 0o the seven years and; haif of h1eervice there; but he had not thought it worth his while to forward Mr. Shaws letter to the londonderry Company. The plaintiff had got a situation in the earlvnart of October, 1856, but he sought to recover damages for thoss which he said he htd sustained by being kept out of a situation, as he alleged, by the want of his testimonial. The defence was that there was no conversion either by the company or by Wells; that, at-the most, the documents were mislaid and lost,wbich did not amount to a conversion - and that everything had been done by the company th4 was possble to obviate any injury to the plaintiff. Mr. Justice COn Ios, having taken the opinion of the jury on the question of damages, which they assessed contingently at 191. IO, directed a verdict to be entered for the defendants, on the ground that there was no evidence of a conversion, giving the plaintiff leave to move the Court to enter the verdict for the plaintiff for the contingent The thercaues tiad ereof n geeral public Interest. This was the last day of these sittings.

They accordlngly bought the shares of Mr. Cooper Russell, a stock-jobber, on the 30th of August, at 30l per share. The bank stopped paynent on the 3d of September, and the defendant refnsed to take the shares. The plaintif, as members of the Stock.Exchange, were held liable as principals to Mlr.

His LooRDsHip, under the authority of the case of " Taylor v. Stray," directed a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, reserving the defendant leave to move to enter a nonsuit. SIMONS V. TRE GREAT WESTJf RALLWAY COXPANY-. This was an action to recover damages for injury done to a quantity of furniture sent by the plaintiff by the defend. ants' railway from London to Taunton. The defendants pleaded several defences; but the substantial one was that the goods were received under a special contract, under 'which it rfas aSreed thatthe defendants should not be liable for any loss or jury to the goods on condition of their being carried at a special rate. Mr. Borill, Q., and Mr. Hfoneyman appeared for the pdlaintiff; and Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and Mr. foth defendant. *~~Mr Mills for the The plaintiff, it appeared, was a retired coal merchant, who in 1 _5, wishing to go and reside in Somersetsire, sent his furniture by the Great Wegtern Railway from London to Taunton. He saw it packed and delivered at the Pad. dington station himself, where he paid 71. 16s. for the carriage. A clerk then sked him to sign a paper that he was the owner oi the goods, which the plaintiff objected to sign, as he could not read it without his spectacles. The clerk, however, assured him it was only a matter of form, and he might either sign it there or at Taunton, and he thereuon signed it. At the back of this, which appeared to be a receipt note, were a number of conditions, on which the company relied as the terms of the special contract, which exonerated them from all liability as to the goods. These conditions the plaintiff swore he never saw or was at all aware of. On the arrival of the furniture at Taunton much of it was discovered to have been broken and injured on the transit, and a box was missing containing linen. For the defence the clerk who had received the goods was called, and he stated that the defendants had two rates of charge-one was in cases where goods were received at the risk of the company as common carriers, which wa 50 per cent. higher than the other, where the parties sendina their goods took the risk He could not tell under which rate these goods had been received. His LORVuS, in summing up, left two questions to the jury-first, whether Mr. Simons had signed this paper dsmply as owner of the goods; and had been mLiled as to its being a special contract; and, secondly, whether as a question of fact the goods had been sent at any special rate, of which there was no evidence. The jury found that there was no special contract, and found a verdict for the plaintiff for damages agreed upon20 guineas. Two cases remaining in the paper were made remanets, and this finished the sittings.

James were counsel for the plantiff, Mr. Huddleston appeared for the defendant. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages for an assault, and also for having been improperly dismised from her situation of barmaid. The defendant pleaded a denial of the contract of service as alleged in the declaration; and as to the assault, that the plaintiff was intoxicated, and had been mildly removed by him from his house in consequence. The plaintiff, who is the daughter of a lawyer's clerk, stated that, having filled the situation of barmaid at the Eagle Tavern, she advertised for a similar place on leaving that establishment. The result was that she was engaged for a year by the defendant, but she found, after a short ex perience of his hoe that the place would not suit her, as she was expected to be "hail fellow well met" with all the Icose girls who frequented the house. This she refused to do, confining her intercourse with such customers to "thanks" for their custom. In consequence of this the defendant and his wife took offence, and from that time they began to annoy her by imputations of insobriety, till one rig t, when she was ill, the defendant repeated that charge in a more direct forns, and gave her a blow or push which caused bar to fall forward and cut her temple on the counter of the shop. The plaiDtiff, when cross.examined, indignantly demed the imputation of insobriety. On the part of the defendant, several witnesses were called to prove the justification placed on the record, but the jury adopted the lady's version, and eventually returned a verdict for her wvith lof damges.

The planticff a warelousman and commtoion agent, eieed on busines in inBreadaeet, Cheapid, was ndoperto part wih three parcls of goods, condssting of gtriped orleas and figured lustre%s to one Henry Dikog who pretended to have authority from, and to reprent the house of Measr. Fitzgibbon and Co., of Cork, better known ase the Queen's Old CIaste Company, general wholesale and retail drapers. This firm had a, plae of business in Little Love-lane, and for a few weeks inc185, abour the time when the transactions took place, Dicks was their clerk, but had no authority to buy goods, under any eircumstances. The fist two parcels ho gonnoiced at 141. and 661n, were desivered upon Dicktes ord ah Queen's Old Cmatle Company's office in Little Loverlne. Th e third paroel, of 1 pieces invoi ed at 119t , wasoabout tohhe deliveredat the ume place,but, there being some obstruction to the cart dawing up, Disks came to plaintiff'sservat, a fsw-aras distant, told hin not to wait and signed the delivery-book. The plaintiff soon found that taheoods had been take o to the defendaan r. auction-rooms, Jiri-street, Ludgate-bill, and gave him notice not to part with tnem.

He never had any title. There being no real vendee, the plaintiff had never pated with the pro. perty, and Mr. Burton muLst be responsible to the reAl owner. This caze varied from " Kinsfr v Mry L S. much as there was a real buyer in that case, a person known, to whom the property passed, andl who could therefore deal with it as he thugtfit.

A police-constable who bd {e prisoner in cbarge sid that 'while he was bringing him fromMsidstone Gaol he asked him how Long was; nd he in repla sk!ed i f be had not received ay inteligence about him, and whether he was prepaed to hear the answer. He sid tt he wa, and the witnen then said, " I a sorry to tel you that Corporal Long is dead." The prisoner made no reply. Mr. SIEIGH then addrewd the jury for the defenoe, and urged with great earnestness the possibility that there had been some quarrel or dispute between ihe unhappy deceased man and the prisoner, and that in the height of pasion the latter had t the deadly tojury upon himand upon this ground he atked them to say that tbt r- soner wa not guilty of the eime of wilful murder. and thus save his life from being sacrifieed upon the saffold.

It wAs a melancholy instanee of the ananer in which a man migbt be seduoid by hiis evil psEiOns to coni. mit a crime like this. It appead that he had gone on board this vessel expecting to be pronoted to the rak of quartemaser, and that heing disappointed in this respect was the moving cause of those feelings that had ld to the commission of tbe crime. It was highly neooeasry for the preservation of discipline in Eer Majesty's navy that any one in authorityrshould be protected from the revengefUl feelings of those whose amiconduct theY might have to make a report of, and a the prisoner had destroyed the deceased by a violent death he must expect himself also to die a violent death. A short time would be allowed him to prepare for that fate, and he eould only entreat him to devote the time that remained to him to the reigious consolation that would be afforded him. The learned judge then passed sentence of death in the uua form, and ordered the prisoner to be handed over to the utaody of the Sheriff of Kent, upon whom will devolve the duty of carring out the sentence of the lawr. The prisoner did not appear in the slightest degree affected when the setence wa pronounced, and when the learned judge had concluded he turned round, and in the most unconcerned mranner walked away from the bar.

MIDDZESLX eSSINS Friday, Mya 15. (Before Mr. PASIHLEY, Q.(J., AsitdntTucdge.) Margaret Trail, 40, was indicted for having stolen four borushes, value 8s., theproperty of Gilbert Elliot Earl of Minto, and a pair of boots, the property of Elizabeth Beinsell. On the afternoon of the 16th of April a police constable observed the prisoner go down several areas in Eatonsquare, apparently for the purpose of begging. He watched ner roceedings, and saw her go down the area of the Earl of Mmto's resider^e, and try the door. Finding it was unfastened, she opened itvery gently and went into the passage on tiptoe, and in a few minutes came out with something under her shawl. He stopped her, and roquirod to see what she ihad concealed, but she refused to inform him, and said he must take her to the stationhouse if he wished to satisfy himself. He at once aoted upon her suggestion, and at the station they found upon her the articles named in the indictment. The jury found her Guilty. It appeared from a return from the Weatmuinater Prison at the prisoner had been committed no less than 18 times eatwveenti Mlay, 1853, and MIarch, 1857, for offences of various serTnhe oudAreISTAXTJIJE sentenced her to four years' penal Margaret Watson, 25, a charwoman, was indicted for having stolen a tableoloth and other atticles, value 31., the proerty of ilnthona Ashley Cooper Earl of Shaftesbury. nea picaded "1 Guilty."' On coming intocourt to be discharged the grand j rymade a presentmert, in which they specially alluded to this case, to call the attention of the Court to the circrnmstance of a tablecloth bearing an earl's coronet and marked with the initial '5" having been received in pledge without hesitation by a pawnbr oer. The prigoner had been employed as a charwoman at Lord libaftesbury's, and had frora time to time, stolenx table linlen. The Ads1SrA 4UDGo called up the pawnbrokers who Were in attendance to prove the p edging of the property -Mr. George Greaves Brooks, of South Audley-street, and Edward Stevens, assistant to Mr. Dobroe, of Gilbert-street, and communicat-odto them that the grand jury had made espeoial mention of their having received in pledge articles with a coronet upon them from a woman in the prisonxer's condition of life, and advised them to be more cautious for the future, at the samae time reminding them that indictments were sometimaes preferred against persons for receiving stolen property. The pawnbroker said the marks had not been noticed. The Ass1sTAsNi-JUDGE eaid, they ought to have been. The prisoner was sentenced to 15 months' bard labour. John Day, 34, was indicted for having obtained by means off fal.se pretences a bottle of eau de Cologne, the property of John Savory. oeu e on,teppry In April, 1855, the prisoner went to the shop of Mr. Savory in Bond-street, and told the shopman, Mr. Kingston, that he had been sent by Admiral Sir George Sartorius, who was staying at Limmer's Hotel, in ConAlit-street, for a bottle of eau de Cologne, and as the Admiral had an account at Mr. gavory's the article was given tobhim, and hevvenitaway. Soenedoubt subsequently arose, and the shopman went to the kotel, and found that Admiral Sir G. Sartorias was not staying there, and that The story was false. Oni the 17th of last April the prisoner went to another shop of Mr. Sw~ory a, in Regent. street, and asked for v. bettle of eau. do Coloegn for 'Captain Keppel, of the Oodstream. Gcards, and he was recognized by the slopman, who had been transferred from tne Bond-street establishment, as the person who had obtained the bottle, ae he said, for Sir G. &artorius. 'The shopman engaged him in a seemingly agreable t-9tec2 t4e, but privately sent for a constable, and peratly to his astonishment the prisoner was removed to the pocoestation. Admiral Sir George Sartorine said, the prisoner wag :in his service between four or five years ago. In lSSS he was not staying at Limmer's Hotel, nordid he give the prisoner instructions to obtain eau de Cologne for him. Captain and Adjutant Koppel, Grenadier Guards, aaid, he never gave the prisoner any directions to obtain eas de Cologne for him; in fact, he had never meen inm until a few daya before. The prisoner merely said, he did ant use JMr George Bardormus's nlame, but one which wvas fietitious. 'X'he jury found him GuatdU and three former convictions for fraud were proved against him.

Whefn her daughter wes appte. headed for tho robbery aetLoxd Shaftesburys by Inspector Lester, of the C dlvison, a ,pawnbroker's duplcate for 16 napkins wvas found In her ,posiession. These proved to be the property of Lord Palmerston, and she was accused of havmg stolen them. It was sbown that tho daughter had neverbeen at Lord Palmerston's * and the kitobenmaid, in answer to a juror, stated tiat, though the prisoner would be allowed to take away broken victuals, she would not, of couse, bo pesmitted tory it away in napkins. She had no business to makeuss of them in any way at an. The prisoer said she knew nothing whatever of tho pledging of the articles, and sho never saw them. The assistant to Mr. Dobree, pawnbroker, Gilbert-street, where the property was pledged, said he could not identify the prisoner as the person wvho pledged it. The AISTlW.JUflDGE, in summing up, remarked to the jury that upon the napkins produced there was a mark of a viscount's coronet and th lettcr "P." underneath, and he felt bound to say that a pawnbroker ought to feel that from such a person as the prisoner, or her daughter, it was highly improper to receive articles so marked, as he must know tiAt such articles could not properly be in their possession, and also that a jury might possibly take a particular view of such a case if it were submitted to them in a properp hape. The Jury, after a sorit consideration, Accusmted the prisoner, on l;he ground that the evidence did not bring the charge home to her beyond doubt.g The AsssAiry-Junons ordered theoproperty to bcegiven up. The pawnbroker's assistant said some of the napkins were not marked, and the whole lot were very old and not worth 5s. It might easily be supposed that they had been given away as perquisites. A juror said there had been a great want of care and caution on the pawnbrokers' part in taking in articles so marked. Samuel Morris, 32, seaman, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of larceny. The AssisTAeb-r-Jui3aE said the prisoner was sentenced to 10 years transportation in 18c0, and was therefore now on ticket-of-leave. The former conviction was not laid in the indictment, or he should have sentenced him to penal servitude. He should sentence him to two years' hard labour, and at the end of that sentence ho would be remitted to undergo the unexpired term of his sentence of transportation. Eliz Hooper, 17, and Johanna Henrzessy, 16, pleaded gUlty of stea1ing a ol.-note, the property of Rebecca Nathan, their mistress. Hennessy said, the other prisoner took the note, gotit c.hanged, and then gave her half the money not to tell. looper said, she should not have taken it had she not been advised. They were each sentenced to eight montW hard labour. Timothy Burns, 30, pleaded guilty to a charge of haying assaulted James Goddard, a police-constable, in the execution of his duty. The prisoner is a powerful and desperate loking man, and lived in an Irish " colony" at sI,Sd gton, called " the Buildings," of which he was -lnown as the king. He and his associates had a f,a among them to assist such of their number as got. I trouble. The COURT sente itd him to 12 months' hard labour. " (Be! ore Mr-. .CR1asY.) Heather ;sfallda Gale, 23, and MEary Sarafield, 21, were Indicted for having stolen two brooches and other articles, and 101., the property and money of Charles Wing, their mlaster. Mr. Talfourd Salter appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Omridge for Gale. The prosecutor is a medical gentleman, having a residence at Walham-green, and the prisones had been servants there-SarsfLeld as cook aud Gale as housemaid. About 12 months ago Gale gave the alarm of a burglary having been committed on the premises, and on that occasion goods and money to the amount of 401. were stolen, but suspicion fell upon her eventually, and she confessed that she broke open the shutters to make it appear that thieves had entered, and that she herself committed the theft. Upon her earnest supplication Mr Wing forgave her, and was induced to Mow her to remain in her service. The same thing was repeated; a burglary was supposed to hav be en committed, and a great quantity of articles were carried off, and Gale made up a story with a good deal of ounning; but Mrs. Wing, an elderly lady in very feeble health, sespected her, and it appeared that Gale had committed the theft with the aid of the other prisoner, the greater part of the property sup. posed to have been carried of by the thieves being found m their possession by the police. The jury found both prisoners Guil4y. Sentecec was deferred.
PoLICE. GUMDHALL.-John IIHind May, of 126, Stanley-street, Pimlico, and Huggin-lane, William Taylor, of 1, Churchpassge, Gresham-street, and Goorge David Myers, of 4, Malvern.terrace, Islington, described as agents, were again brought up before Alderman Hummmi By, oharged with conspiling together to obtain large quantities of goods in two cases to the value of 5001. and 6001. with intent to defraud Mr. Thomas Gorman and Mr. Alexander Lawson, .3ambric handkerchief manulfacturers, of Lurgan, jin the county of Armagh, Ireland. After additional evidence had been given the prisoners were remanded tiU Wednesday, Taylcr and Myers putting in the same bail as before, in two sureties of 250. each and their own recognizances of 5001. May's bail was increased to double that amount. WOBRSYP-STRH=. - Johan Joosen, a German, was charged with being concerned in the following robbery. Statham, a constable of the N division, was on duty at half-past 5 that morning in the Kingsland-road, when he saw the prisoner and another man standing together down a court, and three times distinctly saw the latter pass something bright to the prisoner, who apparently thrust what was given him Into the lining of his trousers. Both men then walked away, and he followed them, but on seeing themselves followed they took rapidly to their heels, separated, and, the confederate having eEcaped down a narrow tUrning. he pursued the prisoner, and did not succeed in taking him till he had reached one of the arches of the Eastern Counties RaUway, at least a mile from the spot where he had frst seen him. Mr. ARuoLD expreesed sttrprise at this, and questioned the constable, who at last made a reluctant adaission that he had repeatedly called "Step thief," and "Stop him," but that no one assisted him till within the last quarter of a mile, when a private person took up the chase with him, and that, though he pased two constables, who heard his cries for aid, they paid no attention whatever to them. Mr. AR'OLD at once ordered those men to be reported, and Sergeant Townshenid, the acting inspector, assured the magistrate they had already been so. On the road to the station a packet of five table and dessert spoons fell from the prisoner's clothes to the pavement, which packet the prisoner tried to kick away, but it was secured by the officer, who also, on searching him at the station, discovered in his pocket a silver box filled with coins, together with a de- cater colr and six more gravy, salt, and egg spoons thrust into his stockings; the whole of which the prisoner declired he had bought of a man for 5s. The constable added that he was so knocked up in his long chase of the prisoner without help that he could hardly stand when he did catch him, and was obliged to give him up. Kiss Hannah Hunton, a Quakeress, residing at Stamfordbill, identified the article produced as the property of her mother, and forming part of the produce of a burglar committed in the hotuse that night, the thieves effecting an entrance throughthe dining-roomwindowattheback ofthe house, by cutting out a pane near the fastening, and removing an iron bar which secured the shutters. The plate had been stolen from a drawer in the sideboard, which had been forced, several boxes had been removed from one room to another and ransacked, and a writing desk and workbox had been burst open and their contents scattered about the floor. An old pair of shoes were discovered inl the hail, but at the same time it was found that a new pair had been taken instead; and so cleverly had the burglary been effected that, notwithstanding all the violence described, it had not disturbed one of the family. The prisoner had nothing to say, and he was committed for the completion of the evidence.

NOIRTON inquiredai there was any evidlence to connext Cordner (who surtndered to his bail, but was not placed in the docn) with the other Prisoners, and Sergeant Conpiny replwed.-Nothing, exce ing his having been seen walkinig once or twice in the neighboiurhood wher-e they resided. A witness was caled to prove this, but all he coulld say. was that his shop was in the Caledonian-road, not far from a' turning irk which the beerhouse of Willam Schines -is situted,and e sa Cornr alkon or twice along the Mr.Solnsos sid hatMr.Bra,th prpritorof the Bull Coeieroal nn t Drtfrd,feeingconvinced of the "ith jxn at his own expense a young woman who was his barmaid, who woulad uly eoroborate his evidence 2Is May Tomkins, tOm barmaid at the Bull Inn, at Dartford; fully eorroborated the testimony of Mr. Bray, and a young fellow named-Peter Gressley, who wore a Crimean medal, deposed to accor anying Cozdner, on the night of the 22d ult., by the OI'&oc traiu to Dartford, sleeping there that night, an.stpending the greater pLrt of the next day in his company. In addition to this it was ob4erved tht the young man Cordcnr bore a strong resemblance to two of the prnoners, particularly to Fish, but, notwith1 staandng this, thetwo witnesses before persisted in saying he was te person they saw at the prosecutor's shop. *Mr. Neale urged that Cordner ahonldbe furtherremuanded on bail. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ reaue Mr. Solomon said his client would willingly attend any inquiry, but was, with his friends, anxious to have the stigma attaobed to such a charge removed from his character. Mr. NonToN thought the acosed for his own sake should attend- the further inquiries, and he should admit hin to do so on his own sureties. One of his former sureties, however, said he should be bail for him to any amount; and his offer was at once accepted. The ca3e against the other prisoners was then gone into, and, in addition to that of Mr. Mloran, two other robberies were clearly proved, and they were remanded for further examination.* Among the property found in their possession not yet owned was a valuable cornopean in a box, the manufacture of Messrs. Rudall, Rose, and Carte, of Bond-street; two gold watches, one of French manufacture and the other English, the latter having the name "J. G.

THE SURKISt VA Vy. PLYMOUTH, FRIDAy. The Turkish linc-of-battle.ahip Peiki Zaffer, 104, Captain Ismael Bey, which arrived at Plymouth last October, and was placed in the hards of MIr. Turner, master-shipwright of ewham-yar, for t~he purpose of being pierced for a screw propeller, made a most satisfactory trial outside the harbour yesterday. Her machinery has been carefully fitted under the inspection of Mr. Trickett, chief engineer. The engines are of 650 horse-power, Napier's patent horizostal direct; boilers, ordinary tubular; cylinders, 72 inches; stroke, 3 feet 6 inches; screw, 18 feet diameter; pitch, 23 feet; pressure full steam, 201b. ; revolutions, 4 per minute, will go 55 to 60; probable consumption of fuel, 50 tons per dy The PeikiZaffer has the masts which belonged formerly to Her Majesty's ship Queen; with this exception no alteration has been made in her equipment. She burdens above 3,000 tons, is 205 feet long, and beam of 60 feet-a proportion of width exceeding greatly aU the ships-of-war lately constructed by the anpetier naval Powers. The ship s not in favourable trim for the experiment, as sho drew 35 feet 8 inches forward and only 26 feet 8 inches at. Mr. Turner and Mr. Biddleoombe, Master.Attendaut at Keybam, who went out in her, propose that she shall be trimmed to 27 feet forward and 28 feet 8 inches aft. The ere was consideredl of so much imaportnce that his Excellency Admiral Salib Pasha and Colonel Kadri Bey ceng down from the Turkish Embasy, and were met by Abdoulla Effendi, the Turkish ConsuL from Manchester. Mcr. Robert Hughes, asistant to the chief engineer steam branch, ittendted on bebalf of the Admiralty. There was a moderoke breeze from south-weds, ut her canvass was not used by Mr. Thompson, the Queen's Harbourmaster, who eonducted the trial. The ship appeased to be thoroughly under the control of hee r enrgines from the fist and in going out A harbour, notwithrstan ing a headwind and heavy ground swell, answered her helm admirably, the only inconveniencer being caused by herpitchinag, which wru be remedied when er trim Is altered; the log gavre her about 8-1 kots.

The- society had. found a fundamental ground of rehggous teachll in which almost alldenominations of Christins oould cordially unite withoutany sacrifice of theirdoctrinal orsectarian feelings The peopleof Ea d had openly declared that te teaching tof primal achoos mus be a relieons teaming, andtheonlv difficulty wa to say what that teaching shouf be. In thos matter the British and Foreign School Society set an example to all other, givni g to th chiuldren of the labouring classes a gnerfalndamiental Christian knowledge sufficient to aake themi discharge their duties actively and properly in life without entering into any d ruted points of doctrine. ti ey only taught the simplet road and open ground of rellgious truths epor whi,h naurly all denominsa tions agred, andl the words of the Scriptues were only ex. plained aocording to their mosnt obtious practical and generaxey received meaning. To others was left thtask of teaching the doctrines and formUairles of the denomina. tion to which hereater their parents might wish them to belong. He hoped the ocety would always tQvtinue tueo and fast to those great rinciples, and that it would in consequence reive that widely-extnded respect which up to that time it had met pvith. The present conjuncture was one which caled for renewed efrorts, and greater sacrifices from all the friends of the suciety to supprt a system bymeans of whieh education wu be plac at once on a broader and more permantfotig The present voluntary system was now on it ra,adisfinds must exert themselves to show that it S the bet caloe hiLted to meet the wants and necesitiego country, and to improve the inadequate and helpless elemental schools which they saw in all direcons, and which hardly feserved the name of schools at all. Nowwas the timlefor the friends of the principles of the societ to make fresh efforts to provide g;ood schools for the chidren of those who could not pay for education, that they might give them that instruction which would enable them to fulfil their tasks in life andl fit them to paws not only successfully throoigh the parts thoy liad to play in this world, but prepare them also for the Iwfe which wf s to come. (Hear, beiar.) Sir JoEas Boitn.t u briefly seondedl the rmotion, congratuhating the soioety upon the very suoessful nature of their report, and hoping thar it would go on in the path which it hID so wecl begn, and-persevere until the educational principles of the British and Forig Sc'hool Society were diffused and adopted throughout the country. (Hear.) M1r. hIL Pssn.ras said he did not wish to offer any obstruction to the business of the meeting, but before the resolution was put be felt it his duty to remark upon an obcervation whicoh had fallen from Mfr. Cowper to the effect that the relious teachingof the socets sools was of a kind thAt was fitted for ahlost all religious denominations. Whywasitnotsuiedforall isted f almost all?

Mdr. gn PlLme continued, and said he was sorry to think that that rues had been departed from, though he had Ined the society under the belief that it would have been Mtharter. He reI de to fnd himself in opposition to some of those by whom the society was now managed, but he felt compelled by duty to take the presenit course, and on the part of himself and those who shared his relgious opinons to complain that peculisr relious tenets were tacght, and that the doctrine of the Tihuity asd the Atonement was inculcated upoa the children attending at the Borough schols. There were many noblemean andl gntlemen who entertained the same opinion as imoef with respect to this being a departure from the society`s regulations. He was authoized by the Marquis of Iansdowne, whom he had lately seen upinon thi subject, to state that his lordship had asbenunder the belief that no teaching of peculiar doctrines took pslace in the schools Connected with this society, ahnd the noble marquis hsd been much surprised whenho becameacquaintedthatsuchwasthefact. Aftelr referring to Lord Brougbam, who, he ad, also entertained the opinion that the teaching of the doctrines he had mentionead were opposed to the formal rules and regulations of rrthey society, be.

Mr. PnHLLu's then, af ter a brief expression of his regret that he should feel called upon to differ with the committee, and stating that his onlY anxietY was to restore the schools to what their original founders had intended them to be, proposed the followingresolution w That the teaching of wht are usually dennelusted orthodom doctrines ingthe Britims andorethg School SocietY.xts tated by tho la'W secretary in his pamphLlet entltlod " The Unitrifan Attacic," ta ib derom,atinn ao the fundamental rules of the aceiety, and that the same he discontinued." deitM of Christ, and the Atonement, resolt which was the 4th rule of the sofiety) has listened to with oonsiderableimpatienco by tho meeting. After some discussion, Lord JoHrT RUSsML appealed to Mr. Phillips to withdraw his motion, content with having brought the matter under the notice of the oommittee The school was open to his visits, and if hereafter on inspection he did not feel satisfied with the way in which its reEgious training was given a special meeting of the society might be summoned to condder the whole question. Mr. PEPmrss was most reluctant to adopt the visits of inspection recommended by his lordship, but said lie had no objection to withdraw his resolution, provided two gentlemen-Mr. Price M.P.. and Mr. Lawrence-were placed upon the committee of the society. Mr; FOirTEiE, on the part of the bommitteo, thought the request unreasonable, inasmuch as it was a request that the committee should admit two gentlemen avowedly as the representatives of a religious denomination, when the very principle of the British and Forei School Society was that it recognized no religious de in its management. (ear, hea.) Mr. GuFOxY HOiRE opposed the motion, and said it would be no severe loss to the society if the Unitarian body withdrew their support from the schools entirely, for he believed their presence frghtened more away than it brought. It would be a lamentable day for this country hen the teaching of such great truths Ma tho Trinity, the divinity of Christ, andHisatonement, ore regarded aslin culoating "wpeculir religious tenets," (Hear, bear.) After afew remarks from Mtr. H. SoLL, wiho remonstrated against the very warm tone adopted by the last speaker, Lord 3. RUSSELL put the original motion, as to the coutstitution of the committee of thle society, and Mr. Phillips's amendment, when the former was carried by an immense majority at-d amid loud applause. Mr. G. HoARt then moved,- " That this meeting. Imred with thea growing importasoe of th is soce, wuld urge its cisinito au t. both on accoDunt of Ito liberalchaOracdter end Its wldesp-e.d ~ftuenoo in the promotion of SaritSuosD education., In proposing this to tho meetine Mr. Hoare took occasion to revert to the discusEion which had talken place, and to express his sincere regret if in the warmth of debate he hd been hurried into expressons calculated to round the feelings of any of his hearers.

TE PitoESTAwT AiLE:E.-The annual meeting of a soeiety called"The Protestant Allianoe,"esUblishe(d for anti-pp purpoI a us held yeserday aftwinoon in the. hal of te reemasoes Tavern. The Earl of Shaftesbury presided. The speeches presented no point worthy of artihcularnotice. From the report (which wus judicionalyiatri.- buted and not.read to the meeting) it appears that important. additionshavebeenmadebothat homeand abroidothe.ocie. ties engaged in the work of opkosing the papacv. In consequence oc the bold and aggruesmve movements of the ChurchZ o Rome in CheIsea and the neighbourhood an effort in being: made to establish a " Sonth-west London Protestant 'lnttate," with objects and plans similar tothose of the lington. Protestant Institute. "The North of England Protestan' Organization," the formation of whieh was alluded to in the last report, is now fairly established at Manchester, and already reports some branches formed in oonnexion with it. An " Alliance" has been formed, or rather revivbd at Sheffield. At Darlington, Canada, an " Alliance" has also been formed, and commenced its efforts. with promise of vigorons supprt It is the second established in the colon. By a recent communication fromc Halfax, Nova Scota the committee learn tha' in consequence of the intolerable power of the Romiih party in thecolony an association similar in aim and principles to the, Alliance is being formed, and that there is reason to hope. that kindred institutions will be esblished in the colony. The committee maintaina regular correspondence with these; foreign societies and are anxiously aiming toatrengthgn and extend their union with Protestantsin allpatsoftheSrorld - Meetingshave been held and lecturesde1iveredatvarioas local Protestant societies. No further steps have been taken in regard to the erection of the proposed monument to oom-- memorato the Mrbtys of the MArian persecution id consequence of the appropriation of the site of Smithfieldmarket being stil tndetermined. The repeal of the Maynooth Endowment Act of 185 is resolutely pursued by the society. The experience of every 7re increasingly convinces the committee- that the aim qE thBe heads of the Romish Church in this country is; to render their teach more intense and :their system more rigorous, with a view to a more complete mental Eubjugation of al professing their tenets. "This," adds the report, "is abundantly evidenced by their.proceedings in Ireland, where it is clearly theiraim to eradicate all moderato Romanism and to establih Ultramontnisin. in itaroom. The maintenance by the State of a coallege whlcb is the centre of this tyraunizing system-a centre, moreover, not to Ireland only, but to all prs of the globe where theEnglish languagoeisapoken-isan intolerable grievance which. nuat be removed. The issue of this straggle is With God." The nunnery question is aIso touched on, and cases adduced bearing on the subject In regard to foreign operations the committee presented memorials to Lord Clarendon in behalf of huggen in Tuscany, and De Mora in Spain, and these. representation. received that prompt attention which has been continually given to such case by his lordship. Both. these prisoners for the truth obtained their liberty. The committee were also instramental in obtaining therelesse of XL Jacquet at Chambery, who was liberated through the influence of Count Cavour. The funds of the society are in a satisactory state. The report was adopted, and the usual resolutions afterwards agreedto. The audience was swelled by a large assemblage of the fairer mex. M uBFzr I= OF Ã¯Â¿Â½8,000.-Thomas Fox Lings, cashier to Mess.

In addition to the 2.OO0L proved to have been deficient in one aocount on Monday several others were gone into. There was an entry in the bank ledger in his handwritiDg of December 27, 1856, of 3,0001., recelved from the Manchester a4d Salford Bank, hut there was no entry in the cashbook inm which he should have accoun'ed for it, and he had never, in fact, paid in the money.
