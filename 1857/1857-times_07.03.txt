THE GLASGOW POISONlNG CASE. I WREDNESDAY, JULY L-SECOND DAY. ' rne tril of Madeleine Smith was resumed before the High Court of Justioiary, at Edinburgh, this morning at 10 o'clock. The prlsoner entered the court in her usual airy manner, and sat for some time unveiled ; she appeared in excellent health, and never during the day even slightly hung her head, except when reference wa s made to her lovt letters with the deceased. William Stevenson, one of the clerks of Messrs. Huggin, and Co. the employers of the deceased, was recalled and rel examined.-I first gave ap seven letters to the Procurator Fiscal, six of them being among those found in the office desk of the deceased, and the seventh being the letter found in his vest pocket. I did not on the 24th or 25th of March entertain any serious apprehensions of the case forming the subject of a criminal charge. I felt uncomfortable, but nothing further. My feelings of discomfort pointed me to a quarter where some explanation was likely to arise from, hut nothing more. Re-cross-examined.-I did not look at the dates of the letters I gavo up at first, and only marked the envelopes with the word " desk" to signify I had found them there The Fiscal did not mark them that I saw. I took a note o the postmark, but did not preserve it. The Fiscal did no tell me to do so. I found letters of AL L'Angelier in his tourist's.bag, the dQek in the warehouse, a leather port manteau in his lodgings, also, I think, the desk in his lodgings, and one in the vest pocket. I cannot tell how many letters were in the desk at the warehouse They were very numerous. Part of them were wrapped in two brown paper parcels, sealed with the company's stamp and part lymg loose. They had apparently been sealed b the deceased. I am not aware whether the seven letters gave tho Fiscal were in a sealed packet or lying loose. I cannot identify any of the letters found in the desk excepting the sixth I have mentioned, and the seventh I found in the pocket. Ido not know how many I found in the travelling- acg. Ishould say under a dozen. I did not count them. I read a portion of them. I can't say how many I found in the portmanteau. There were a good many of them. They were partly tied with twine and tape, and partly loose. I could not now distinguish those found in the portmanteau, nor those found in the desk in the lodgings. I cannot tell how many there were of the latter. (Shown a large number of letters from Miss Perry, which he examined.) These letters I cannot speak to individually, but I saw letters in the same handwriting among those I delivered up. One of the signatures is " IL A. P.," others " Miss Perry." I saw letters m this handwriting in all the different repositories of the deceased. I cannot tell how many I saw altogether in this hand, but there were a good many, though not so many as in the other handwriting. I did not attempt to divide them. My impression was that there could not De one-half so many in this hand as in the other. I could not say the number of letters in the first handwriting. (Shown a packet of 199 letters, being the subjects of the second inventory for the prisoner. ) Judging from the bulk of the parcel now shown me I should say that there might be 250 to 300 letters altogether in all the handwritings. I know that deceased had other correspondents besides those whose letters have been found. I had seen letters addressed to ladies in England, and he had also correspondents in France. He was a vain person-vain of his appearance; very much so. He was of a very mercurial and excitable disposition. He was a packing clerk In Huggins's warehouse. I am not aware what money he had when he went to Edinburgh or Bridge of Allan. I saw the first medical report made by Dr. Thomson. It was made on Tuesday, the 24th. (Shown seven medical reports, Nos. 155 to 161 in the inventory of the prosecation.) It is not among these. I saw it and read it. It is on a small sHp of scroll paper. There isa report there by Dr. Thomson and Dr. Steven. It is dated March 28. The report I speak of was made on the 24th. That report was given to me, and I gave it to Mr Young at the Fiscal's office. I don't think rva seen it since. (Shown No. 1 in second inventory of the prisoner-a portemonnaie.) That was got in the vest of deceased. There are two rings inside of it. These are the rings I have already spoken to as found in his pocket. I do not think I gave this up to the Fiscal at first. It was locked up in one of the drawers. It was not got out tiUl the afternoon his clothes were packed up in one of the portmanteaus, which was some time after. I recollect giving several articles out of the portmanteau to the agents for the prisoner, but am not certain if this was one of the articles. (Shown letters which he identified to be in the handwriting of L'Angelier.) This witness wvas also cross-examined at great length as to the entries in his memorandum book, which were somewhat incomplete and irregular. By the COURT.-When I was firstnrecognosced I understo there was a criminal charge agam'st some one in connexion with L'Angelier's death, and I believe it was known I was the first person who had looked into his repositories. I think it was after I gave up the letters in the desk to Murray, I am not aware that the sheriff was present on any of the occasions. I understood at the time who it was that the letters in the first handwriting were from, and that the charge was murder. The party was in custody by this time. Neither the sheriff nor the Fiscal examined tho repositories of deceased so far as I saw. The letters from the various places were put into a bag, but no inventory was made. There were no letters left. The officers got everything that was in the repositories of the deceased, including those in the second handwriting (Miss Perry's). Murray and another officer got away a brown paper parcel of letters from the lodgings, hut I cannot say that the parcel was sealed. In the course of my precognitions I was asked to put my initials to some of the letters only n this witness being relieved, The LonD JUSTICE CLEBIc said,-I think it right to say that I know of no duty at once so urgent and so imperative as that of the sheriff superintending the direction of every step in a precognition for murder, and in the experience of myself as an old Crown officer, and of my brethren as sheriffs, the course which this case appears to have taken is unprecedented. You are at liberty to go, Mr. Stevenson. Your memorandum-book has not been kept, perhaps, very regularly or scientifically, but I think you have done everything according to the best of your judgment and experience, nor do I suppose there is any imputation in the matter against you. The DEAN of FACULTY.-Oh, no; quite the contrary. The LORD-ADVOCATE.-I think it right to say that, perhaps, before the end of the case, in some respects the observations of your Lordship will be modified. The LORD JUSTICE CLERK.-That may be. I only speak as to the examination of one witness who had apparently first received possession of all the letters to be founded on in support of this charge. The witness was desired to be in attendance, lest he should be called for again. Dr. Hugh Thomson, physician, Glasgow.-Iknew the late M. L'Angelier. He first consulted me about a year ago about a bowel complaint, from which he reoovered. He consulted me again on the 3d of F'ebruary as to a cold, .a cough, and a boll on his neck. He was very feverish. I prescribed for bim. I saw him next about a week after. He was better of his cold, but another boil had made its appearance on the neck. He came to me again on the 23d. He was very feverish, his tongue was much furred, and it had a patchy appearance from the fur being off in several places. He complained, and said he had been vomiting and purging He had some svmptoms of fever. His puise was quick and his condition prostrate. I took his complaint t be a bilious derangement, and prescribed an aperient draught He said he had been unwell for a day or two, but he told m he bad been taken worse during the night. Imade som notes on the 6th of April, but the dates of the visits an medicine I had from my books. I continued to visit him I did so on the 24th, 25th, and 26th. On the lstof March I intended to visit him, but I met him on the Great Westernroad. On the 24th I prescribed some powders for him. 0 , tbe24th hewas in much the same state as on the23d. Heha i vomited the draught I gave him on the 23d. From hi - whole symptoms I took it to be a bilious fever. On the 25th he wasrather better, and had risen, but was on the sofa undressed. On the 26th he was considerably better and cooler, and I did not consider it necessary to repeat my visits then. It did not occur to me that these symptoms arose from any irritant poison. The symptoms were just those that would bave been shown had he taken any poison. He looked very dejected and Mllilike. His colour was darker, and there was a dark shade about his eyes. I saw him again about eight or 10 days after the 1st of March. He was in much the same state. He said he was thinking of going to the country. I did not give him any prescription or advice, but about the 26th of February I told him to give up smoking, which I thought was injurious to his stomach. I never saw him again in life after the last time I spoke of. On the 23d of March Mr. Stevenson and ML Thuan called on me and mentioned that M. L'Angelier was dead, and they requested me to go and see the body, and give my opinion as to the cause ofhis death. They did not know I had not seen him in his last illuness. I found the body laid out on a stretcher, dressed in grave clothes. The skin had a slightly jaundiced hue. I said it was impossible to give any decided opinion on the subject without opening the body. I requested Dr. Steven to be called. I saw what he had vomited, and the landlady told me of his symptoms before death. After Dr. Steven came he corroborated the landlady's statement as to the symptoms, but he could not account for his death. There was no resolution come to on the Monday. On Monday afternoon I was called upon by Mr. Huggias and another gentleman, and I said the symptoms were such as would be produced by an irritant poison, and it was such a case as in:ErigIan_d w_`u-ld bha-v.e heern t-h-e stubj'ect of a coroner's inquest. Next morning Mr. Stevenson called and said Mr. Huggins requested me to make an examination. I said I would resuire a colleagne, and Dr. Steven was fixed upon. We made the examination on Tuesday at midday. We wrote a short report the same day, and afterwards an enlarged report. (Shown 155 of inventory-the later report-which stated that death might either have arisen from poison, or from internal congestion arising from exposure to cold or fatigue.) That is a true report. I was summoned to attend the Procurator Fiscal's office the day after I had written that report. The stomach was put into a sealed bottle and delivered to Dr. Penny. On the 31st I was requested to attend at the Ramshorn churchyard to aid in an inspection of the body. Dr. Steven, Dr. Corbet, an I Dr. Penny were present. The coffin was opened in our presence, and the body taken out. I recognized it as the body of LAngelier. The appearance it presented was much the same generally as when we left it. It was particalarlsv well preserved. We removed various portions of organs of the body for analysis. A report was made of the state of these organs to the effect that on the smaller intestino and other organs there was a considerable quantity of arsenic. All the substances removed from the body on the exhumation were left with Dr. Penny. Cross-examined.-When I came on the Monday, Mrg Jenkmis showed me what deceased had vomited or pureet It was not preserved that I know of. I had first made a short report to Mr. Stevenson before the report of the 24rts of March. When I attended If. L'Angelier in Februarv there were no symptoms that I could say were not those of a bilious attack. Dr. James Steven, physician, Glasgow.-I was sent for early in the morning of the 23d of March by Mrs. Jenkins, who stated that a lodger of hers was ill. I myself had been ill for about a week, and I was unwilling to go out at night, and I thought from the descritiopn given I mighit prescribe without going. It was named to me as a bilious attack, and seemed from the description given me to be so. I told her to give him hot water to make him vomit, and then to give him some laudanum. Mrs. Jenkins came back for me, and when she said he was a Frenchman I thought I had better go, lest he might not be understood by thoge attending him. When Isaw him his features were pinched, and he appeared both mentally and physicaly depressed. I spoke to him. His voice did not seem particularly weak when I first entered, but it became weaker while I was there. He complained of his breathing being painful, but it did not seem hurried. I dissuaded him from speaking, and ordered more blankets and hot water. He seemed to have vomited effectually, and I prescribed a little morphia. His pulse was not very weak, but the circulation was somewhat weaker at the extremities. He complained of thirst, but he seemed not to wish to drink much, as it increased the pain of vomiting. He wanted cold water, and was unwilling to take whisky, as his landlady spoke of giving him. I saw a chamberpot filed with his vomiting and purging. I ordered it to be removed, because it was offensive, and a clean vessel put in its place, that I nmight see what he vomited. The first vesselwas kept for some time, but I said it might be thrown away. He said, " This is the third attack I bave had. The landlady says it is bile, but I never was subject to bile." He mentioned how doU he felt being so i and away from his friends. He spoke several times of " his poor mother." I stayed about halfan-hour. I apphed a mustard poultice myself. I called again at a quarter past U. When I caUed his landlady told me he had been quite as bad all the time. She said she had wbeenlin the room, and he had now faUen quiet. When X wenb in Ifound he was dead. I went again that day when Thomson was there. I asked him if there was anytbing particular in his previous symptoms, but we were bot at a loss to account for the cause of death. The landlady said she thought it was natural causes. I refused to give a certilicate of death without making an examination. I made a report next day along with Dr. Thomson; and I was also present at the second examination, when the body vwasexhumed. I had never attended any case in which there had beenpoisoning by arsenic. Frederick Penny, professor of chymistry, Andersonian 'University, Glasgow.-I recollect on the 27th of March last being communicated with by Dr. Hugh Thomson and one of the clerks of the Fiscal, who came to my laboratory in the Andersonian Institution and delivered a bottle, of the contents of which they asked me to make an analysis It was closely secured and sealed. I broke the seal and examined the contents, which were a stomach and a reddish coloured fluid. I was reqnested to make the examination for the purpose of ascertaining if those matters contained poison. I commenced my analysis on the 28th. (Shown No. 157, being a report of the first analysis made.) Its conclusions are that the different processes through which the stomach and its contents were passed proved that they contained arsenic; and, secondly, that the quantity found was considerably more than sufficient to destroy life. The stomach contained about 82grains of arsenic, in addition to five grains that had been made into powder by the testing processes through which the substance was put. It is not easy to give a precise answer as to how much arsenic would destroy life. It has been known to be destroyed by two or three grains, but four or six are generally considered sufficient. I saw the bDdy exhumed. (Shown No. 158, being second report of analysis referring to the death of P. E. L'Angelier.) The conclusions o! that analysis are-first, that the body of the deceased contained arsenic; and second, that it must have been taken by him while living. I have no opion to give as to how long before his death the body had contained arsenio. (Shown No. 209, a list of articles delivered to Dr. Christison on the Uth of April, chiefy the bottles containing the stomach and intestines.) These articles were entirely in my custody till I delivered them to Dr. Christison. In the course of shis investigation I was asked to make a report regarding arsenic bought at Mr. Currie's druggist, :auchiehall.street, and Mr. Murdoch's, Northstreet, Anderston. The object was to ascertain if the articles sold as arsenic by them really contained that substance, and in what quantity. Murdoch's contained 95-1 of pure white arsenic, and Mr. Currie's, 94 4. Mr. Murdoch's containtd carbonaceous matter, and MIr. Currie's particles of indigo. I should not have expected to discover any part of the indigo in the contents of the stomach though such had bEen taken. If Murdoch's arsenic had been administered, and if it had settled down in the contents of the stomach, as in this case, I thould have expected to find some traces of the carbonaceous matter. Suppose there had been prior aidministration of arsenic a month previously, and that arEenic had been bought at Murdoch's, I certainly should not have expected to find traces of the carbonaceous matter. Various articles were delivered to me by Mr. Wilson' said to have belonged to deceased. There were 12 bottles, two paper packages, and a cake of chocolate. I examined them to ascertain their general nature and to see if there was any trace of arsenic. Witness stated the contents of each bottle and packet, none of them having any trace of arsenic. I identify the bottles now produced. Excepting the solution of aconite in one of the bottles, none of their contents is of a poisonous nature, ard the quantity of the solufion of aconmte would not have been suffident ta destroy life. The bottle is half-full and has about tiso ounces in it. If the whole bottleful -had been taken it would not have been sufficient to destroy live. Aconite acts as a poison by producing insensibility, coldness, and death. never heard of prussic acid being used as a cosmetic, I should think it highly dangerous so to use it. I am not aware of any action It exerts to whiten the skin. I shauld say it would be very dangerous to use arsenic as a cosmetic. If rubbed into the skin it might produce symptoms of' pisoning by arsenic. I bave heard of arsenic mixed with limo or other mdatters being used as a depilatory. ArEenious acid is not so used; it is usually the yellow sulphide. Cross-examined.-In the entire stomach and its contents there was arsenic to the extent of 83. erains and 7-lOths. That was exclutve of the white powder, which weighed 5 gridns un4 2-IOths. Thetwotogether come to nearly 90 grains. Idid naot determine the quantity in the organs of the body rer6oved on exhumation. In the small intestines there mtist have been a considerable quantity. When the contents were allowed to repose arsenious add crystallized out of them, and deposited abundantly on the sides of the vesseL .E cannot give you an idea of the quantity in the small intestine. It was a very appreciable quantity, but I should not hke to guess. If deceased, when attacked by symptoms of arseni poisoning, vomited a great deal, the arsenic would be carried off by the vomiting or not accordin to the mode of administration. If given with solid food and in a sold state, a large portion of the arsenic would be ejected from the stomach, but if it were stirred up with a liquid, and thereby thrown into a state of mecnamcal suspension, I should not expect any considerable quantity to De ejected by vomitting. I could not say what proportion would be ejected by vomitting if administered in a flnid. I should not be surprised if in such a case as much had been ejected as remained. Judging from what I found of the state of the body the dose of arsenic must have been of very unusual suze. There are cases on record in which large quantities have been found in the stomach. There are examples in whivh larger quantities have been found than the pre4ent. There is one case in which two drachms have been found, that is 120 grains. That is the largest quantity I recaU at present. I cannot tell of any case in which a large quantity has been found in which the arsenic was administered by another party. In the case which I have referred to the poison was voluntarily taken. It would be verydifficult to administer a large dose of arsenio in a liquid. A large dose would exclude many vehicles in which arsenic might be administered. Nothing in the appearance of the body indicated the time at which the arsenic was taken. The utmost period that I have known to elapse between the administration of this poison and the appearance of the symptoms is eight or ten hours or thereabout, Very often the symptoms appear in an hour. There are cases in which the symptoms have been late in appearing, and in which death did not take place for two or three days. The greater part of the colouring matter in Currie's arsenic might be removed by adding cold water and agitating the two together. After a portion of the arsenic has subsided, and you remove the superlatent water, a portion of the coloUring matter will go away. With great dexterity the greater portion might be removed, but It would require the skill of a chymist to remove it. Murdoch's arsenic wss coloured with carbonaceous matter. It had the character of coal soot. I cannot tell by theexamination of a dead body whether the arsenic has been administered in one dose or severaL I think the external use of arsenic in anyway very dangerous. There are eases in which it has been applied to the whole sldn, and symptons of poisoning ensued -vomiting pain, but not death. In one case it was rubbed upon the head. From the remembrance of general reading, it is amy impression that it would produce eruption of the skin. I should not like to wash myself in water in which arsenic had been put, but I ean give no further answer on that point. The arsenic is absorbed by the blood, and it is through its rapid absorption that it reaches the vital organs. RKe-examined.- Cocoa or chocolate are substances in which aeconsiderable dose of arsenic might be conveyed. I have found by actual experiment that, when 80 or 40 grains of arsenic are put into a cup of warm chocolate, a large portion of the arsenic settles down to the bottom of the cup, and I think a person drinking such chocolate would suspect something when the gritty particles came into his mouth; but vhen the same or a larger quantity was boiled with the chocolate, instead of being stirred or mixed, none of it set. tles down. - I could not separate the soot from the arsenic by washing, but a very large quantity of it may be separated in that way. 1{e-cross-examined.-A larger proportion of the arsenic dissolves by being boiled with the chocolate than by being thrown into it. Coffee or tea could not be made the vehicle of a larga dose of arsenic in that way. By the CouIJT. -The period between the administration and the appearance 'of the symptoms varies in different persons, nd more especially according to the mode of administration. Pain in the stomach is among the first symptoms after a large dose, and may exist before momiting commences. Ten to 20 grains might be given in coffee, but not a large dose such as we have been referring to. The LOUD JUSTiCE-CLuItK, as witness left the box, said that more satisfactory, lucid, and distinct evidence he had never heard. Dr. Christison, professor in Edinburgh University.-I recollect Dr. Penny bringing to me various substances, said to be portions of the body of P. E. L'Angelier. I made analyses of them with the view of ascertaining if they contained arsenions acid or other poison. After subjecting to the usual processes the white powder given me by Dr. Penny, which he had found in the stomach of the ceceased, I found it to be oxide of Arsenic. The quantity of arsenic in the stomach was considerable, and more than sufficient to destroy life.-Witnes8 was referred topassages in his work on the subject of poisons, one of which describoed symptoms similar to those which the deceased oxperienced s sesulting from poison. Witness said, if l found all these effects it would lead me to suspect arsenic or some other irritant poison. Sometimes the effects of arsenic pass off quickly, sometimes they continue for months, causing indigestion, weakness, loss of strength, emaciation, and occasionally diarrhma. The report of Drs Thomson and Steven was read to witness, and he was asked is there anything in that description youL would expeot to find after a frequent administration of arseni ? Witness saiditwasaverynatural appuearance after a frequent administrationo of arsenic, bt the appearances might proceed from previous diseases asing from other causes. The LORD-ADVocATE described the symptoms of s. Jenkins, when Dr. Christison said,-I have no doubt the cause of death was poisoning by arsenlc, and that being the case I should have entertained strong ss. picion as to that being also the cause of his prior illness. £he symptoms I have described are just those that hbav occurred in tho repeated administration of doses singly in- sufficient to cause death, Witness then read. report upon I Murdoch and Currie's arsenic, which he found to contain tbe usual proportion of arsenic and of colouring matter. The indigo in Currie's was not real indigo. Cross-examined.-If colouring matter had been administered with the arsenic I should have expected to find it in the small intestine. I did not search for or apply any process of analysis for the detection of colouring matter. If colouring matter had been administered with the poison, I think ib might have been found. Some of the components of seot are insoluble. I should have expected to find it but for the vomiting, which, however, would not haveremoved it entirely. I should havefound true indigo had it been there. It appeared to be what is called waste indigo, auch as is used in dyeing, that was in Currie's arsenic. I cannot particularly tell the constituents of waste indigo. Charcoal is one of the constituents both of true and waste indigo. Charcoal is also the chief constituent of soot. I was informed by Dr. Penny of the large quantity of arsenic found in the stomach. Suppose the iUness commenced by severe vomiting and purging, I should suppose the quantity of poison swaUowed by the deceased to be much greater than the quantity found in the stomach and intestines. The quantity of the poison vomited would depend very much on the means taken to facilitate vomiting. Hot or cold water given would greatly facilitate the dischargeof the poison. It is quite impossible to tell the quantityvomited. Itwouldbereasonableto suppose that as much was vomited as remained. It might even'without extravagance be four orfive times the quantity that remained. There was nothimg in the description given me by the Lord Advocate of the case inconsistent with the sup. position of death from a single dese of arsenic. The symptoms of arsenic in such a case are symptoms also found in other diseases, such as soevere bowel complaint or cholera. All the symptoms which have been described to me in this case have been found in cholera. The ulcers found in the duodenum and other parts might have been the previous indications of a disease which would present the symptoms of bowel complaint or cholera. The general run of cases is from 24 hours to two and a-half days from the administration of poison till death. There are exceptional cases. I have known of death in two hours. The period between the administration and the appearance of the symptoms is generally abont two hours, but has been known to bo seven or nine. It does not appear that the Period of appearance of the symptoms depends on the quantity of the dose. There setms no connexion, generaUy spealdng, between the quantity and the time. -n the present case the quantity swallowed may have been double tho quantity found-200 grains probably. There is one case on record in which six onnces were taken. But we certainly consider 200 grains a large dose. There are many cases recorded of suicide from very large doses. In the great roportion of cases of suicide the doses are very large. Tlhat may be accounted for by the desire of the person to be certain of the result, but murder by injuries, as well as in cases of poison, is often detected by the excess of means. In almost aU cases of murder by poisoning there is more poison used than is necessary to occasion death. The very fact that poison is found on the stomach at all proves that more was given than was necessary, for it is not what is left that causes death but what has been on the stomach. I do- not recollect any case of murder by arsenic in which anything approaching to 88 grains was found in the stomach of the deceased, but I cannot rely on my recollection as to a negative fact of that kind. I have sometimes found it in very small quantities, but I have never paid so much attention to the quantity as to the fact. The use of a large quantity is of course a great mistake on the part of those wishing toadmainister it without snspicion. A large quantity is not easily conveyed ina iquid. It would only convey what was easily soluble, or so fine as to be suspended in water. If the arsenic was pretty coarse and gritty its determination to the bottom of a liquid ,would be the greater, and a less quantity could be administered through it. It is a very rare occurrence that any one is able to eat a hearty meal after once having taken arsenic, but one remarkable case of the kind is recorded in the French books. Re-examined.-Cocoa or chocolate is a vehicle in which a great deal might be administered. Active exercise or a long walk would, I think, quicken tho action of arsenic. Exercise precipitates the action of all poisons, exceptnarcotic poisons. The colouring matter might have been present without detecting it. A previous administration of arsenic would quicken the effects of the subsequent one, and the constit5ution would become more susceptible of the effects of the poison. Amad6e Thuot, examined throughM. FrancoisChaumont, interpreter.-I am a clerk in Glasgow, and lodged in March last in 3Mrs. Jenkins's, and with Md. L'Angelier. I had seen the photograph shown me in M. L'Angelier'es room, and believed it to be the portrait of his intended. I knew of his being in correspondence with a lady, but I never saw any of the letters. I knew of the lady wanting some of her letters back. I remember going with L'Angelier to the Broomielaw on one occasion, and of his stopping at a house near Blythswood.square to deliver a letter. He made a slight noise with his stick on tho window. It was the second window from the corner of Blythswood-square. After L'Angelier's death I showed that window to a police officer. L'Angelier sometimes went out at night. H e told me he went to his intended's house. I recollect his becoming very iU one morning after he had been out at night. I asked him in the morning if he had seen the lady. He said he had seen her. I asked if he had been ill inher presence. He said he was. I do not think he was out the niht before the morning of his second illness. I do not thin- that in conversing with L'Angelier he ever told me the lady's name. I understood that his intimacy with her was against the consent of her family. I understood that the house at which the letter was delivered was the house at which the lady lived. Cross.examined.-I have seen x IL'Angelier take landanum several times. I told him once that he took a good deal-that he took too much. He said he could not sleep without it. He once told me he had taken a great deal of laudanum. I have seen him take it four or five times. By the CoURT.-I never saw him take much laudanum, except may be when he was suffering a great deaL Auguste Vauvertr de Mean, Chancellor to the Fxenoh Consul in Glasgow, -I knew IL L'Angeier for about three years. I also knevw iss Smith, the prisoner. I was acquainted with her family. I knew there was a correspondence between themi, and L'Angelier told me of his relations with Miss Smith, though I did r.ot wish his confidence on the subject. Mr. Smith lived some time at Row. L'Angeller lodged with me once or twice at Helensburgh. I told him- I thought he should go to Mr. Smith and tell him that he was in love with Miss Smith, that she retarned his attachment, and ask his consent to their marriage. He said that Miss Smith had asked her father's consent, which he refused, so that it would be of no use for him to ask it. I have had very little intercourse with deceased since I was married, which I have been for a year. I remember TL'Angelier coming to my office a few weeks before his death. I spoke of having heard that Miss Smith was to be married to some one else-namely, a Mr. Minnock. L'Angelier said it must surely be false, but that if it was to come to this he would forbid it, and that he had in his possession documents that would be sufficient to forbid the bans. I don't exactly recollect if he said he had heard anything on the subject from Miss Smith. I did not see him again. I did not think I was at liberty to speak to Mr. Smith of hL L'Ange. lier's attachment to his daughter while he lived, but after his death I thought it my duty as a gentleman to tell Mr. Smith of the correspondence between his daughter and the deceased in order that ho might take what steps he might think proper for her exoneration in case anything might come out against her. I told him that the deceased must have had a great number of letters from Iiis daughter in his possession, and that I thought it right to apprise him of thiq, in order that he might know what to do, and that the letters might not fall into the hands of strangers. I told him that I unddrstood no seal had been attached to his property. and that the letters were in such a place that numbers of people had the opportunity of seeing them. I went at Mr. Smith's request to Mr. Huggins. Hwe ms not in hisoffice, but I saw two other gentlemen. I told them what I was charged to ask, but'they said they could not give them without the consent of-Mr. Huggins. I asked that those letters should be put under seal till they could be disposed of. I think this was on the Monday. I went bhck to Mr. Smith next day, and told him what the answer was. In the interval I heard some rumours which induced me to go again. About that time I saw Miss Smith in presence of her mother. I apprised her of the death of L'Angelier. She asked me if it was of my own will*that I had come. I said, No, that it was atthe special request of her father; and I asked her to tell me what she could, in order to put me in a position for contradicting the statements which had been made to me byML L'Angelier. I asked her if she had seen him on the Sunday night? Miss Smith told me she did not see him. I observed to her he had come from Bridge of Allan by specal invitation given by her in a letter written to him. She told me she was not aware he was at Bridge of Allan; that he was in Glasgow; and that she did not give him an appointment for Sunday, as she wrote on Friday evening, making an appointment for the following day. She said she e.xpected him on Saturday, but he did not come, and that she had not; seen himx on Sunday. I put the question to her five or six different times and ways, and told her my conviction was that she must have as en him on Sunday, as he came from Bridge of Allan on Sunday to see her, and if he had committed suicide he was not lisely to have done so before at least having seen her. I said to Miss Smith that the best advice I could give ber was to tell the truth, because it was a serious affair, and might lead to inquiry by the juStice, and that if she did notspeak tho truth asto her having seen him, probably a servant, or a policeman, or somebody passing might be able to say that they had seen him, which would throw a very strong suspicion onthe motivethatcould haveledherto hide the truth. She then got up and said, " I swear to Mlonsieur Meau I have not seen L'Angelier for three (or for six) weeks. I swear I did not see him yesterday." I put the question five or six tinies, nud her answer was always the same. I asked her how she. being engaged to another gentleman, could carry on a clandestine correspondence with her former sweetheart ? She told me she had done so in order to try to get back her letters. I asked her if it was true that she had been in the habit of meeting L'Angelier of late, and that she was in the habit of making appointments vith him? She told me that L'Angelier had7never entered the Blythswood-square house at aL I asked her how she had her meetings with L'Angelier s She told me that ho used to come to the corner street, Main-street I believe, that he signalled to her with his stick, and that she opened the window and used to talk with him. I asked her if it was true that she had signed letters with L'Angelier's name as his wife, and she told me she had. Cross-exainined.-I lived at Helensburgh in the summer of 1855. L'Angelier visited me there. He once came on a Saturday evening. We spent the whole evening together. On Sunday we went a good distance on the Glasgow-road, and returned. L'Angelier, instead of following me, went down stairs, and ina short time I went downto inquire why he did not come to his dinner, but I met him returuing, when I found him excessively pale. I asked him | what ha been the matter; and he told me he had been frightfully giek, vomiting all the timo down stairs. He .omtKmes complained of being bilious, but I cannot recollect at wishat.Kperiod. Once he told me he had an attack of cholera; this must have been last year. I was then acting consul, and he did duty as my serre- - oyfor some-weelmi -He told meo that lie had been1 on one occasion attacked by a burning pain at the heart but L'Angelier had often complained to me, and, as I thought, without any great cause, and therefore I did not pay any great attention to it. I knew that he was ie the habit of taking laudanum, and in his occasional visits to nne at felensbargh I never knew him come without having it in his carpet-bag. He once spoke to me about the use of arsenic, but that is now a considerable time ago-I think in the winter of 1853-5. It was on a Sundaythat we had a conversation about it, but I do not recollect how It arose. We had a long discussion as to the possibilitv of a person taking arsenic without being injured by it. I ridiculed the idea of its being possible to take it without danger. while he maintained that it was possible to take it In a small quantity. I oannot, however, precisely recollect theconversation. He once told me about his having been jilted by an English lady, a rich peron, and he said that on account of that detertionhe was "like mad"for aboutafortnight, and went about without taking food. I think he was an excitable person. When he had any cause of grief it affected him very much. By the COURT.-I had less intercourse writh L'Angeller after I was married. The reason was that I feared he might be ledto take some rash step with Miss Smith, and as I had some young ladies under my charge I did not think it was proper that I should keep up my intercourse with him. I mean that he inght have proposed to make an elopement with Miss Smith; indeed, I felt sure he would propose this as he told me that he would do so in the event of M£r. Smith not giving his consent to his daughter's marriage with him. I understood from L'Angelier that Ms Smith had engaged herself with him. The reason I went to Mr. Smith after IiAngelier's death was that, as I knew the letters were love letters, it was much better the family shouldhave theta in their hands than strangers. MIy opinion of L'Angelierwas, that he wasa regular young man that hewas religious and exemplary in his conduct, his ony faalt was excessive bragging. He boasted of his appearance and of his influence, and said of Miss Smith, "I shall forbid MademoiseUe to do so auid so," or " she shall not dance 'with such a bean." He seemed jesions that any one should pay attention to Miss Smith. Re-examined.-The photograph shown me is very like L'Angelier. By the COURT.-My acquaintance with deceased was only accidental. The Court adjourned at 6 otclock till 10next morning (this day). (BY ELeoRic A-NI U-TERNATio0.AL T,GIApI) THIRD DAY-THUSrSAY. The evidence for the prosecution was resumed. The prisoner's declaration was read. In it she denied having seen L'Angelier on the Sunday night, but said she had made au appointment with him for Saturday, when he did not come. She had been in the habit of purchasing arsenic and using it in washing as a cosmetic, which she had been recommended to do when at school near london. She did not suppose the servants knew of it. She had told the apthecaries she wanted it to kill rats. Mary Buchanan was with the prisoner when she bought arsenic on one oecasion. She had been told by her of her engagement to Mr. M1innock, and was to have been her bridesmaid. In cross-examination she said she remembered their reading at school of the Styrian peasants taking arsenic to give them breath in climbing and to improve their complexion. The purchase of arsenie was very openly made. Willam Murray, page to Mr. Smith, was once sent by the prisoner for prussie acid, which the apothecary refused to give. Cross-examined.-Mfiss Smith attended prayers with the family at 9 o'clock on Sunday night, and was at breakfast as usual on Monday. Several druggists were examined to prove the purchase of arsenic by the prisoner for the alleged purpose of killing rats. Their cross-examination showed that one purchase was made in Miss Buchanan's presence, and another in her sister Bessie's, and that in one case the arsenic had been put to her fatber's account. In each case, she signed the register without hesitation. Wiliam Harper M;innock had made proposals of marriage to the prisoner in January last, which she accepted on the 12th of March. They fixed the marriage for the 18th of June. On Thursday, the 26th of March, she was missing from her father's house, and witness, with her brother, traced her on the way to her father's country house, at Row, on the Clyde, and got her to return. In cross-exammnationthiswitnesssaid,-Miss Smith was at the opera with him on the 19th of February, returning about 11 o'clock. The reason she gave for her flight on the 26th of March was that her parents had discovered her conduct in a former love affair, and that she felt distressed on that account. He afterwards understood this to refer to the deceased. Mrs. Clark, with whom deceased had lodged two years, deposed to various particulars of his intimacy with Miss Smith; and MTr. T. F. Kennedy spoke to deceased having been much excited by a demand from prisoner to return her letters, which he determinecly refused to do, and threatened to show them to her father. Both these witnesses had heard deceased speak of having bowel complaint or cholera. John Murray had searched all the druggists' registers in Glasgow, but found no trace of arsenie having been purchased by deceased. The case for the prosecution is still unfinished, onIy 35 out of 80 witnesses for the Crown having been examined.

PARI1AMENT AY INTELAGENa;.. HOIJ M OF LORDS, TiiRuy, JTULy 2. The LORD CllM;CZLOR toek bAi seat on the woolsack at o'clock. ADMIRAL Or, TRE FLEET. The Marquis of SALIEBlTty said that it having been Oustomary that the senioYr 9duniral in the service should succeed to the post of Admiral of the Fleet, it was naturally felt by the navy generally -and more especially by the ofricer now at the head of the list, that it was hard the commission should not havo been Mled up since the death of Sir Byamn Martin. It wsas a merely honorary commission, and fairly looked uxpon as a miark of distinction. It was therefore desirable tolmow ewhether it was intended to be filled up. Earl GRAXVIRLE thought it detriLnental to the publio Eervice wren Parliamnent interfered with the Government upon t'ne promoeton or non-promotion of private iudividuals. He should therefore, withoat mueaning any disrespect to the noble marquis, decline to answer his question. The Duke oef NORTHUMBERLAND said that it had dlwans beenLthe practice to appoint to this office, and the appointment was regarded by the navy as a ptroper compliment from the Crown. It wvas therefore worthy of tle conideralien'of the Government wghether they would not continue to appoint the oldest member of the service to the post of Admiral of the Fleet, the salary attached to which was not anore than 3651. per annum. LordCOLCHESTER said that the post of Admiral of the eaeet was equivalent in rank to that of field-niarshal in the army. There had been two field-marshals lately appointed, wnd it was unjust to the navy not to make the appointment in question. Earl GRANVILLE said that the Governuient were of opinion that there was no person particularly marked out at tis moment to fill an office of this sort. Lord BROUGHAM presented a petition from certain 3loman Catholic members of the legal profession, comn. plaining that Roman Catholics did not receive under the operation of the Emancipation Act of 1829 that relief in relation to the granting and holding of pioperty for charitable purposes which they were entitled to expect, and praying tbat the provisions of the Roman Catholic Charities BLl, which stood for commnittal that evening'n,ight be so far englarged as to place Rom an Catholics on a better footing im that respect. Earl STANHIOPE presented five petitions from Lincolnshire against the admission of Jews into Parliannent. GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY (CAPITAL) BILL- On the motion for the second reading of this Bil, Lord ST. LEONARD'S presented a petition against it, and took occasion to observe that, although the Bill was one of a private character, it involved a question of great importance. Their lordships had all heard of the frauds which had been committed by Redpath-frauds which had never been discovered until they had reached a sunI exceeding 220,0001., notwithstanding that they might have been immediately detected if any one of the directors bad taken the trouble of examinirng the books. Having, however, discovered them at last, it was proposed by the Bill to throw the entire of the loss occasioned by the frauds in question upon the whole revenue of the company, as if the loss had occurred in one half-year. M1any families invested their capital in preference shares because they were looked opon as being as safe as Governnent securities, and if the Bill passed those persons would lose all interest for one half-year, and great distress would thereby be occasioned. The revenue for the half-year ending in January last amounted to about a quarter of a million, and that had been nearly exhausted, so that the preference shareholders would get no dividend. Now, the loss had not been sustained in one half-year, but had extended over many half-years, and there was no reason why the remedy for the loss might not be made to extend over several half-years; but most certainly the preference shareholders ought to be paid their dividends in the first instance. In point of fact, the company were not bound by the frauid and forgeries of Redpath, and the only question was one of policy with regard to operations on the Stock-Exchange. Lord WENSLEYDALE was understood to say that, ia his opinion, the Bill would do great injustice to the prefer. ence shareholders. The Bill was then read a second time. ADULTERERS' MARRIAGES BILL. Lord REDESDALE, in moving the second reading of this Bill, said that, in order to remove the objection which had been taken to one of the amendments moved during the recent discussion of theDivorce Bill, that it would be unjust to require an injured husband or wife to be married before a reglstrar, he had confined the operation of this measure to the guilty parties. He simply proposed to enact that the marriage of persons who had been divorced on account of their own adultery should take place at a registry-office. The effect of this would be that the parties could, if they pleased, have the religious ceremony performed afterwards, but it would not be compulsory upon any clergnman to celebrate their marriage. They must find some person who had no objection to perform such a ceremony, and whose conscience, therefore, would not be violated by its performance. He did not think that this would impose haidehip upon any one; on the contrary, it would aflord great relief to those to whom othervwise a great injury would be done. It had been said that hitherto no clergym an had objected to marry divorced persons; but no great weight was to bo given to this objection, because the cases in which such marriages had taken place were but few, and it was only during the discussion of the measure now before Parlalaent that this question had taken a deep hold of tho public mind. Under these circumstances, he moved that the Bill should be read a second time. The LORD CHANCELLOR said he thought there were a great many reasois why their lordships should not agree to the motion of his noble friend, but surely it was an allsufficientreasonthathe was nowproposingforthe fourthtime that which had, within the last two or three weeks, been three times rejected by their lordships. A proposal of precisely the sam e effect was made while the Divorce Bill was under their lordships' consideration. Indeed, that proposal had the advantage of this measure, because it was more consistent, and met the whole case. This Bil only went half-way. It was said that a great number of clergymen considered marriage indissoluble, and therefore ought not to be called npon to re-marry any person who had been divorced, whether nnocent or guilty. The amendment moved by the noble earl to his left (EarlINelson) went to that extent, and therefore, if assented to, would have removed the whole of this, as he believed, iliaginary grievance. It was three times decided by their lordships that it was not right to interfere in such a case, and that, he thought, was of itself a sufficient reason why this Bill should not be read a second time. There were, however, other reasons which would, he hoped, induce their lordships to pause before assenting to anything which would establish so strange a precedent as that involved in this Bill. His noble friend proposed that a certain form of marriage should be adopted for persons who had been divorced. Suppose tho Bill now before the other House of Parliament did not pass into a law, the coasequence would be that, as the only divorced persons known to the law were those divorced by the ecclesastical courts, all such persons might be married under this Bill. It was true that that objection might be removed by altoring the wording of the nmeasure; bub how would this Bill apply to marriages dissolved by special Acts of Parliament? The matter would, he admitted, be open to argument, but he believed that the effect of this Bill would be to alter the provisions of all previous Aots which had authorized marriage in any mode. If the Bill now before the other House did not pass, this meusure would have no offect upon subsequent Acts of Parliament dissolving marriages, because when such an Act said that it shouldbe lawful forthe parties to marry again, that would mean as other persons could. Under these circumstances he hoped their lordships would refuse to give a second reading to this Bill. The noble and learned lord concluded by moving that the Bill be read a aecond time on that day six months. Lord CAMIPBELL thought the proposal of the noble lord wvholly unparliamentary and unprecedented. A Bill which embraced the whole of this subject, and from which this provsion had been excluded, had been agreed to by their lordsbips and sent down to the other House, and would be taken into consideration there. If the other House thought this particular provision a fair and just one they would inBert it in the Bill; but it would be a very extraordinary mode of procedure to send down a rider to that Bill in the shape of a proposition which their lordships had already rejected two or three times. He was very much surprised that his noble friend, the great lord of order in their lordships Houso, to whom they all looked up in matters of procedure, should have inade such a proposition. The Archbishop of CANTFRBURY said, that if on any point of order, as had been stated by the noble and learned lords, there were a constitutional objection to this Bil, it would, of course, be unnecessary and improper to urge it upon their lordships. But he must express his earnest hope that in this or some other mode, either in this or in the other HouEe, some relief might be afforded to the clergy, who were seriously affected by the matter to which it referred. There was nothing in the principle of the Bill which compromised their lordships by interfering with what they had already determined,-nothing which was inconsistent with their conduct on other occasions. It was now 20 years simce some of those who dissented from the church made a loud complaint that they were forced to celebrate their marriages according to a service which differed from their religious opinions; their lordships judged the complaint to be reasonable, and gave a remedy,-a remedy which completely altered the whole law of rnarriage. The ecergy or the church now complain that they vmiight be obliged byllaw to perform a service which they believed to be inconsistent with the divina command. He would not now discuss the question wbether they give a right interpretation to the Scripture; but he maintained that as long as the same words remained in Scripture there would always be many who would Eo interpret them. Surelyit was not unreasonable to require that persons contracting marriage under the circumstances contemplated in the Divorce Bill now before the Commons House should be sati-fied with a civil conitract, content with the privllege of a legal marriage and a legitimate issue. The case became much stronger by the -nature of the minarriage service. Heowas unwilling to allude more partic'ularly to that service ; indeed, it could bardly be done in con. nexion with this subject without the appearance of profanenaess But their lodships -would rememboer that tlo service assumed, in solemon teros, the divine approval of the marTiage, aud that it was divinely ordered.

The House went into comuAittee oIL this BilL Onr clause 1, Lord ST. LEONARD'8, on the ground that the Bil 'would interfere very )naterMaly with tho law affocting charities, and womld treate a distinction that ought not to exist between Rossan Catholic property and that of other denominations, moved tha&i the BiU be referred to a select committee. The LORD CHANCELLOR admitted that the Bill wa one that was deserving of discussion, but he conceived such dimcusion could be carried on better in the House than by select committee sitting upstairs. The Duke of NORFOLK thought that the Bil should be referred to a select committee. tiehad a number of amend. ments to propose, and he believed that other noble lords had givea notice of some new clauses. The LORD CHAENCELLOR said that after the statement of the noble duke he would not ask their lordships to proceed further with the BiU at the present moment. The Bill was then reported, and referred to a select committee. THE SOUND DIUES BILL. The Earl of CLARIENDON, who was very imperfectly heard, was understood to say that in rising to move the second reading of the Sound Dues BiSl he would not detain their lordships by many observations. The Sound Dues, as their lordships were aware, arose from the right inherent in every Power to impose duties Ol taxes on the commerce carried on within its own jurisdiction. They had been acknowledged by all marittme nations in various treaties, which had formed part of the international law of Europe, for upwards of 300 years. The first treaty made between England and Denmark on the sub. ject of these dues bore the date of 1491. As comr mnerce increased the inconvenience of the tax became apparent, and for many years past attempts had been made to get rid of it by means of compensation. A t the beginninq of last year the Government of the UJnited States gave notice that they would no longer pay the dues. Coemnuni cations then took place between the Danish Governmenl andthevarious States interested in the matter. Acon. ference was held at Copenhagen, and the Danish Govern nent proposed to abolish the dues upon the payment He compensation to the amount of 3,8t0,0001m , whbic was apportioned among the different States according ti data furnished by the Danish Government, of the acciracy of which there was no doubt. This led to a treaty lehict was signed in Mlaroh last by Her Gaoesty's Government, Bythbat treaty the amount of the payment to be made bgEng land was fixed at 1, 126,0001. The Danish Government also con seated to reduce the transit dues over the Hiolstein railways. This, however, was a matter of some difSiculty, and led tc considerable discussion, the Danish Government denying thn right of the other States to interfere with the managemeni of the Holstein railways, which was simply a point oi internal administration. But the other States con tended that they were entitled to insist upon a re duction of these dues, inasmuch as they had been im posed for the purpose of compelling goods to be carried b3 way of the Baltic instead of by the railways, and se of facilitating the collection of the Sound Dues, and the result was that the Danish Government consented tc reduce the transit dues by four-fifths. The amount oi Sound Dues paid by England was about 75,0001. per annum; bat, according to the statements of the witnesses examined before a committee of the House of Commons which sat last year, and especially those of Hes Majesty's Minister at Copenhagen, the loss occasioned by the collection of the tax in the detention oi vessels and the necessary payment of heavy local charge, amounted to a much larger sum, one of the witnesses computing it at 200,0001. a-year. The committee of the House of Commons to which he had referred reported in favour ol the abolition of the Sound Dues, and recommended the proposal of the Danish Government to the favourable conside. ration of Parliament. That proposal was the one which had been accepted. The convention had been signed by 12 or 13 States, ail of them having a direct interest in the trade o' the Baltic, and there was every reason to think that the proposition of the Danish Government was just and equitable, and that the assessment of the indemnity was fair tc all parties. He believed that the arrangement which had been made would be very beneficial to British shipping, which was more concerned in the trade of the Baltic than that of any other nation. It was right, also, to mention that in AprU last the United States' Government entered into a treaty with Denmark, agreeing to pay its fair share of the compensation, and that nothing could be more straightforward and honourable than its conduct throughout the negotiations. He might likewise state that, although by treaty the Sound Does were to cease and determine from and aftei the 1st of April last, yet, owing to the dissolution of Parliament and other causes, delay had arisen in the fulfilment of one part of the agreement. Neverthelebs, the Danish Government had not levied any toUs whatever sinco the 1st of April, nor placed any impediment in the way of our trade in the Baltic. (Hear, hear.) There was one other fact which he might mention to their lordships-viz., that it was not the intention of the Danish Government to remit any portion of this money to Denmark; but for objects of their own the whole of the amount would be invested in this country. The Bil was then read a second time. POLICE (SCOTLAND) BILL. Their lordships went into committee on this Bil. Lord PANMURE said that this Bill was similar in principle to the Police Billfor England passed last session. Some of the Scotch counties had a police force, but others had neclocted to avail themselves of the opportunity, and the Bil enabled boroughs and districts to combine for the purpose of maintaining an efficient constabulary force. The secretay of State vould lay down rules as in England for the pay and clothing of the force, and the same proportion of one-fourth of the expenditure would be defrayed out of the public excheuer. The Bill had been referred to a select committee of their lordships, who had given valuable assistance in putting it into proper shape. The Duke of BUCOLEUCH regarded the Bill as one of great importance, for the inconvenience was very great of having a constabulary force in some of the Scotch counties and not in others. A power was given to the Secretary of State to enforce the building of a lock-up house and stations, but he believed it would be found that sufficient provision was made herein under the Prisons Act. Lord CAMPBELL had no doubt this was an excellent Bill, and that Scotland was very much indebted to his noble friend for bringing it in. It was very creditable to the Scotch ueers and members of Parliament that they met and laid their heads together and came to a sensible decision upon Scotch Bils before they came under discussion in Parliament. He hoped that occasion would be taken either to abolish "rogue money'" or to give it a more creditable name. He remembered, for example, that when a monument was erected to a most meritorious public servant the balance that remained to be defrayed was paid out of " rogue money." (A laugh.) Upon another occasion the dinner bill of some commissioners was defrayed out of the same questionable source. (A laugh.) The Bill then went through committee. The Grand Juries (Ireland) Act (1836) Amendment BiU, the Insurance on Lives (Abatement of Income-tax) Continuance Bill, the Joint-Stock Companies Act Amendment Bill, and the Town Bylaws' Revision Bill were respectively read a third time and passed. The Portland Harbour Bill, the Chatham Lands, &c., BiH, and the Militia (Ireland) Act (1854) Amendment Bill were severally read a second time. CONSOLIDATED FUND (S,(00,0001.) BILL. This Bil was also read a second time and passed through its remainig stages, the standing orders baving been suspended in its regard. The Dalwich College Bill, the Oxford University Bi, the Turnpike Trusts' Arrangement Bill, and the Han'ey Borough Incorporation Bill passed through committee. SALE, OF OBSCENE BOOKS, &c., PREVENTION BILL. Lord CAMPBELL gave notice that he shoald to-morrow (this day) move the committal of this Bill, in passing which he hoped to have the zealous support of the right rev, bench whose sacred calling led them to take so deep an interest in improving the morals of the people. The House adjourned at 20 minutes past 7 o'cloOk.

RICARDO asked whether the Government had any objectionto a drawback on the tissue paper used in the manufacture of earthenware, similar to that allowed on jacquard loom cards ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I have communicated with the Commissioners of tho Inland Revenue, and find that the reason for the drawback on the jacquard loom cards does not apply to the paper used in the pottery manufacture. I cannot, therefore, recommend a drawback upon it. Mr. RICARDO.-I shaRl call the attention of the House to the subject at the earliest opportunity. NIEW WRITS. Mr. T. DUNCOMBEsaid, he hoped that the Housewould permit him to move the resolution of which he had given notice with respect to the issue of a now writ in the case of a seat being declared vacant on the grounds of bribery or treating, and which was in the following terms :- " That in all cases when the seat of any member has been declared voidby an election committee on the grounds of bribery or treating nomotion for the issuing of a new .rit shall be made without seven days' previous notice being given in the votes." He thought it was desirable that the resolution should pass at once, and without waiting till the orders of the day had been disposed of, because several election committees were now iavestigating charges of bribery and corruption preferred against several hon. members, and would shortly make their reports to the House. A similar resolution (with the exception of the seven days' notice) was agreed to in the session of 1847, and in that of 1853 a resolution reqaurng, at the suggestionof thenoblelord the member for the city of London, seven days' notice was adopted with respect to the issuing of new writs. He (Mr. Duncombe) thought that he might claim as a matter of privilege to move the resolution before the orders of the day were proceeded with. The SPEAKER.-I feel bound to inform the hon. member that I do not think that he is entitled to claim as a matter of prvilege to move his resolution out of the usual course of business. It is a matter entirely in the discretion of the House whether they will permit the hon. member to move his resolution at this time. Mr. DUNCOMBE hoped that, ag a matter of indulgence, the House would permit him to move his resolution now. Sir J. GRAHAM recommended his hon. friend the member for Finsbury not to press his motion now. The opinion just expressed from the chair and the unavoidable absence of tho noble lord at the head of the Government evidently made it inexpedient to proceed at once with the matter. The CIHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER entirely concurred in the remarks of the right hon. baronet. Lord J. RUSSELL admitted that his hon. friend tbe member for Fisbury could not ciaim as a matter of privi. lege to propose his resolution now, but he begged the House to consider that if the order of their proceedings wese strictly adhered to they might get into very great difficul. ties, because the seat for a borough might be declared vacant on account of bribery, and then, without notice, a new writ might be moved for as a matter of privilege (Hear, hear.) The House would then be obxged to discn a that as a particular and almost as a personal question. (Hear.) He therefore suggested that the hon. member fer Finshury should withdraw his motion with the view of sub. mitting it again at half-past 4 o'clock the next day, in order that the House might have full notice of its coming on. Mr. DISRAELI thought ib would be hardly right, in the absence of the noble lord at the head of the Government, to sanction so important a departure from the practice of the House, and he tberefore trusted the hoan gentleman would not now press his motion. Mr. LABOUCHERE said that by adopting the sugges. tion of the noble lord, and taking the discussion to-morrow, al irregularity would be prevented. He should therefore propose, on the part of the Government, to take this coarsp, and would afford his hon. friend an opportunity for submitting his resolution to-morrow. The motion was accordingly postponed until to-morrow (this day), at half-past 4 o'clock, Mr. T. Duxco,risx expressing a hope that the Government would take the sub. ject out of his hands. CIVIL SERVICE EAtMIATIONS. In reply to Mr. W. EwART, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER sald that a correspondence between the Foreign-office and ths Civil Service Commissioners, which was laid before Parliament and printed on the 8th of February, 1856, fully explained the nature and subjects of the examination proposed for candidates in the diplomatic and consular services. This correspondence was also reprinted in the first report of the Civil Service Commissioners in 1856, and their second report contained further information on the subject. Mr. EWART said he understood there had been some alterations in the character of the examinations. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER replied that the information to which he referred was furnished from the Foreign-office, and he was not aware of any such alterations. The House then passed to the orders of the day. MIITARY EDUCATION. On the motion for going into Committee of Supply, Mr. WARREN called attention to a general order issued by his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief on the 19th of June, directing "That for the future every soldier after being dismissed from drill shall attend school as a duty until he is reported upon as sufficiently advanced in reading, writing, and arithmetic. With the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, no fees are to be required for this attendance at !chool." He was aware how delicate and difficult must be any inquiry into a military question of this kind, and he was happy to state that he had had some communication with the hon. baronet (Sir J. Ramsden), the result of which relieved him from the necessity of instituting any such inquiry. With the spirit of the order from which he had quoted everyone must concur. All were agreed as to the desirability of improving the education of our soldiers, and he would mow only ask the Under-Secretarv for War whether his attention and that of the proper authorities had been called to the objectionable part of this general order, and what courss it was intended to pursue with reference to it. Sir J. RAMSDEN thanked the hon. and learned gentle. man for the very courteous manner in which he had brought this subject under consideration. The question was one of very great importance; and though they were advised thas theor der referred to did not violate any provision of the law, yet the authorities were of opinion that it would not be desirable-in fact, that it would be very objectionableto act upon it. (Hear, hear.) He had, therefore, merely to state that his Royal Highness the Commander-in.Chief had recalled this order and issued another, in which the clause to which the hon. and learned gentleman alluded had been entirely modified by the withdrawal of the sentence prescibing that the attendance at school should be a part of every soldier's duty. (Eoar, hear.) Instead of this clause there was now simply at reeommendation to commanding officera of regiments that they should offer everv encouragement to soldiers to avail themselves of the fac ities offered them as regarded education. (Hear, hear.) He hoped this explanation would be satisfactory to the Hlouse. (Cheers.) THE STATUTE LAW COMMISSION. Mr. LOCE 1IG rose to caU attention to the large sums of public money which have been expended by the Criminal and Statute Law Commissioners without the consolidation of any branch of the criminal or statute law, He observed that the motions already adopted by the House on this subject implied a censure upon tho Statute Law Commission, but he thought it more satisfactory now to submit a resolution to settle the point as to whether this commission should or should not cease to exist altogether Every one desired that the consolidation of the statute law should be proceeded with. and it might be thought strange tsat no should now propose to destroy the machinery by which this was to be effected. He felt confident, however, that not only did the commission as at present constituted accomplish no good whatever, but that it was productive of evil by pretending to do something, while it really effeoted nothing,-that it was, in fact, a mere sham and'delasion. Let the House see what had occurred in reference to this subject since 1833. In that year a commission was appointed to digest the criminal law and to inquire what could be done with the statute law generally, and they issued a series of blue-books down to 1845. No less than 37,0001. had been expended by that commission, and not a single Bill had been drawn by it. In 1845 another commission was created to complete the work of its predecessor, and that commission spent an additional 12,5001., maidDg a total of 49,5001. expended by those two bodies. It was said that that last commission had drawn one Bill which was once laid upon the table of the House of Lords, but it never passed into an Act. In addition to that sum of 49,5001., he found that a further sum of 1,6801. had been spent upon a variety of Bills which never passed, and he believed that they were the same Bills which the present Statute Law Commission had taken to itself the credit of having framed. In 1850 or 1851 the commission of 1845 came to an end, for the simple reason, he beheved, that all its members had ceased to exist, or had been provided with other places, with the ex. ception of Mr. Bellenden Ker, who had served as a commis. sioner 16 years, and who had received 10,4001. of the public rmoney without any result whatever. The next step in the order of events was the appointment of another commission in 1853, the appointment of which was thus explained by the Lord Chancellor in proposing it:- "But I look further. I conceive there is no reason why tins proposed atop should not at some future time, some years hence, constitute the formation of that which I have always looked forward to as the most desirable, though heretofore I have feared to be unattainable,-a Code Vi¢I Athfe 1sge of that Commissie Was Mr, B, Ecr as four members of the legal profession wero appointed as subcommissioners to act with him. The Lord Chancellor's iastructions to that body were very clear and satisfactory. They were- " To ascertain precisely the text of the statute law as it now exists by determining what statutes have been repealed (expressly or virtualiy), what have exr,ired, and what nave become obsolete or unnecessary in the present state of society. . . The text having been thus exam,ined, a spec%anddetailedreport shouald be made of all the repealed, expired, and obsolete statutes. ,. Tbis report will form the groundwork of a declaratory Bill to repeal or confirm such statutes, to be introduced, if possible, at the end of the present session." That was the session of 1853, but the Bill in questioa had never yet made its appearance. (Hear, hear.) The new commission set to work, and during the first year of its existence it laboured hard. The expurgatory list was pre. pared, but it never had been revised; the sub-coinmissioners were all discha-rged, for what reason no one had yet explained, and Mr. Ker was left alone with his pupil r. Brickdale to constitute the commission. Nothing of importance, however, took place til 1856, when a great eventoccurred. The commissioners then discovered that all their previous work had been useless; they proceeded to argue against the Lord Chancellor's plan of preparing an expurgatory list, and certain " bundlesof statutes," as they had Ybeentermed bythepresentChief Jmsticeof the C;.mmon Pleas, were selected to be consolidated. The greatevent of the year, however, was, that the hon. and learned me cber for East Suflolk joined the commission. The hon. and learned gentleman made a very able speech in that House in moving forleavetoiintrodacetwo Consolidation Bills. TheHouse gave him leave to bring them in, bat those Bills had never made their appearance. The hon. and learnied gentleman npon that occasion made a very extraordinary statement. ie said, "You mut leave the whole matter to me. If you do I will undertake myself in 18 months to consolidate the vhole law of England." He (Mr. L. King) remembered that upon that occasion the present Mr. Baron Watson, who vas then member for Hull, said that if the hon. and learned gentleman would only do in 18 years half as mituch as he had promised to do in 18 months he would undertake to raise to nu memory a column twice as high as that to the memory of the Duke of York in St. James's Park. (A laugh.) He (Mr. L. King) knew not what progress the hon. and learned rnember had made with his Consolidation Bills, but the 18 months had long since elapsed, and not one had yet been laid upon the table. At the end of the sesdon of 1856 several Bills were hastily laid on the table of the House of Lords. He was told that those Bills were sent over to Ireland, and that they came back with certain comments made upon them which showed that it was quite impossible that they could pass, and it was a fortunate thing that they had not passed upon the faith of that commission. He was sure the House would agree with him that if the Statute Law Commission lad been in earnest those Bils ought to have been revised during the autumn and introduced again early in February, 1857. But that had not been done. The other day the same Bills were again laid upon the table of the House of Lords, but every one must see that it was impossible such Bils should pass when they were brought in at so late a period of the session. There had been recently placed in the hands of members the third report as it was called, of the Statute Law Commission; but, in point of fact, it was the sixth report, three reports having been previously presented under the auspices of Mr. Bellenden Ker,-three of these, however, were said to emanate from the Statute Law Board, and three from the Statute Law Commission. If the report lately issued had been the first instead of the sixth, he could readily believe all the promises that were made; but seeing that upon every occasion a fresh plan was propounded and fresh promises were made, he did not see how they could place any reliance upan it. Besides, the right hon. gentleman opposite, the member for the University of Dublin, last session carried au address to Her Majestyrecommending the appointment of a Minister of Justice, and this appeared to him to be an additional reason for dispensing with the services of the commission. He should not longer trespass upon the time of the House. Bethought that he had made out his case, and he begged to move " that an hamble Address be Presented to Her Majesty, praying Her Majesty to dispense with the present Statute Law Commission." (Hear, hear.) Sir F. KELLY did not complain of the hon. and learned gentleman for having brought this important sabject under the consideration of the House. Tho hon. and learned gentleman might, perhaps, have chosen a more fitting and coa. venient occasion for the purpose; but he rejoiced at the opportunity which was at length afforded him of commuanicating to the House something at least of what had been attempted by others, as well as by the Statate Law Comimission, and of what had been done by the commission sinco It had been in existence under Her Majesty's authority. It was but justice to the Statate Law Commission that it shouald be made known to the House and to the country that this great work of the consoHdation of the statute law, which formore than 250 years had baffled and defeated the efforts of the most eminent jurists and statesmen which this country had produced, was now, upon one single uniform and comprehensive plan, actually begun, and.in a course of practical and, he trusted, successful progress under that Statute Law Commission which the hon. gentleman called on the House to censure. He hoped to be pardoned for endeavouring briefly to explain the nature and extent of the undortaking, for not completely and success'ully executing which, during the short time the Statute Law Commission had been in existence, the hon. gentleman charged them with incompetency and incapacity. That work was the consolidation of the statute law, which meant neither more nor leps than converting the present statute-book, consisting of 40 folio volumes and containing upwards of 40,000 statutes, info a short, comprehensive, and intelligible work of four, or little more than four volumes, containing what then would be the whole of the effective and operative law of England, not as at present scattered indiscriminately in confusion through a large number of volumes without any arrangement, beginning with Magna Charta and ending with the last Act in the reign of Queen Victoria, but collected in a short and comprehensive form, containing a series of statutes, arranged and classified, the classes being again sub. divided into single Acts of Parliament, each Act being on a single subject but embracing that entire subject. It was needless at the present moment to dilate on the multiplied evils to which this country, and espocially the Legislature, was subjected by the present state of tho statute law. He needed not to remind the House that in those 40 volumes of statutes to which he had referred, tho whole of the 40,000 statutes, besides 50,000 local and personal Acts, were now to be found according to the order only in point of time In which they were passed; and all these statutes were heaped together, not only without any description, order, and arrangement, but there were a great nurm ber of single Acts and enactments, embracing each in itself avariety of subjects entirelyunconnected. With all the aid to be obtained from indices and text books no one could attempt to make himself master of any single subject without laborious investigation and maldng his way through the whole body of statute law. - And even then he hhad to ascertain, as best he could, whether whole statutes or particular sections and clauses kwere repealed or still con. tinned in force. Not merely the members of the legal profession, but magistrates and country gentlemen, who, for the better discharge of their duties, might desire to pOssess themselves of a copy of the statute-book, must purchase the entire 40 volumes. But independent of the evils felt by all classes from the Dresent state of the statute law, its eflect on the current legislation of the country was more mischievous than could well be imagined. One consequence was that no individual bringing a Bill into that or the other House of Parliament could satisfactorily make himself master of the statute law as it existed in refereneo to the subject on which he propesed to legislate. It therefore often occurred that Blls which had passed through comsnittee with every care repealed over ain stasutes or statutory enactments which had been repealed before; but, what was infinitely worse, statutes which were not known to exist were passed by and disregatded, and new enactments were made in Acts which were found afterwards to be utterly at varianee with existing enactments. Hence arose a degree of confusion leading to an amount of litigation, which became a fearful and wide-spread evil, as in the cases of the Royal British Bank and the Tipperary Bank, in refereoeeto which the courts were engaged in considering the effects of different Acts of Parliamant, which were inconsistent with each other and contradictory. It had frequently been attempted by some of the most distinguished lawyers and statesmen to find an adequate remedy for these multiplied evils, and so long back as the reign of Qneen Elizabeth the state of the statute-book was considered by a commission a p pointed by that Sovereign. SirNicholas Bacon, the eeper of the Great Seal, was employed to make a report on the subject to the Crown and to Parliament ; but even in that early time, when the whole of the statute law was contained in some four or five small volumes, it was foumd, from the state of confusion, complication, and contradiction exist- ing in the statute-book, tthat the attempt to remnedy the ovil mnust be given up, and the most learned men and able lawyers of the day shrunLk from the task in despair. The Statute Law Commission, appointed in 1835, and on which, as the hon. gentleman stated, nDwards of 30,C00. were expended, in their report referred to'some earlier report of 20 or 30 yeays ago, and to a work on publie record,, in which the vwriter, stated that the general revision of the statute law had often been recommended from the Throne, petitioned for by both Houses of Parliament, and engaged tho attention of successive committees; that it had been undertaken by individuals, sometimes with and sometimes without the sanction of the Crown and Parliament, but never carried forward to any degree of maturity. It, therefore, appeared that Bacon, Hale, Somers Hardwicke, Blackstone-all these great lawyers and statesmen-had in succession attempted this work of the consolidation of the statutes and failed. Approaching our own times, Romilly, Tenterden, and Sir R. Peel were found attempting much and accompilihing something in the way of consolidation. The noble member for the city of London (Lord J. Russell) and the right hon. member for Carlisle (Sir J. Graham), with other members of that House, and in the other House of Parliament the first and greatest of the law Reformers of the day, Lord Brongham, assisted by Lord Lyndhurst, Lord St. Leonard's, Lord Truro, and, thou-h last nob least, by the present Lord Chancellor Cranworth, had all directed their attention to this important subject. Numerous committees or commissions had considered the question in 1801, in 1816, in 1829, in 1833, in 1839, and again in 1849, but although these commissions-which were attended with vast expense to the country, and which had all the aid that could beafforded to them by the great states. men and lawyers of the day-had done soniething towards the consolidation of particular branches of the statute law, none of them had been able to devise a specific, intelligible, and unlton plan upos which this great work could ever be commnenced with the slightest prospect of success. He (Sir P. Kelly) now came to the proceedings of that commission which the hon. and learned gentlernau denoanced. Under the advice of the presentLordUhanceliorHlor Masjesty was pleased to appoirt, in 1853, a commission to inquire into thssubject. ae (Sir F. Kelly) admitted that that commigaion had sat from 1853 to 1856 without beinig able to accomplish What the groat and eminent personages he had mentioned had attempted in vain ; but he did not concur with the hon. and learned gentleman. in theopinion that thecom. mission had done nothing, and that the country was not indebted to them for their services. He (Sir E. Kelly) could speak freely of the proceedings of the commission from 1853 to 1135G becauase he had not the honour of being a member cf that body until February, 1856, and he ventured to say that during that shorb periodof three 3ears the commission had done more than had been accomplhshed by all other commissions which had sat duiring the present century. The comrmissionoflIS53, actingupon the plane uggested to themnby the Lord Chancellor, advised in the first instance the preparation of anindex to the statutes, distinguishingthevarious Acts and portions of Acts of Parliament which ha been repe-aled either expressly or bv implication, which had become obsolete froma lapse of time and change of circuLmstance, which had expired, or which had fromu any other caLuse become inoperative. Gentlemen, members of the bar,were employed in what had been called the work of expurgation, anud Air. Anstey. formerly a member of that House,with the asesistance Of Mslr. IRogers, prepared avery elaborate index to a great portion of the statute law,which was laidbeforethe commissioners and was mow in use as a guiide to those mnembers of the bar who were engaged in the work of consolidation. Besides ths lo, most of th e active members of the commission em. ploytd themselves in framing consolidation Bills relating to particular branches of the law; some ten or a dozen, Bils were.produced, and were now in existence, and although they reqtuired certain alterations to adapt them to the plan which had been devised they were monuments of the industry, learning, and great ability of all who were engaged in their PreParation, among whom Mr. Belleunden Ker-& gentlemnan -with whom, except professonally, he had not the honour of being acquaint-ed until he met him upon the Statute Law Commission-was distinguished for his diligence, learning, skill, and untiring energy and perseverance. There were others, also, who had rendered great anLd valuable services in this work; but although indices were framed, Bills prepared, reports made, and suggestions throwrn out, it was not until last year that the comamission could agree upon one fixed specisie and uniform plan for the consolidation of the whole statute law. He (Sir F. Kelly) thought, considering what the commissionx had actually accomplibhed within the short space of four Years, which exceeded in practical utility aU that had beenx done by former commnissions, he might safely and confidently appeal to the House whlether the censure which had been Passed upon it by the hon, and learned. gentleman (Mtr. Locke King) was deserved or not. In 18.56, however, it occurred to several members of the commission that, althouagh the Bills that had been prepared were of great use and importanace and afforded some guidance and assistance towards the consolidation of the statute-book, it 'Was evident upon a consideration of the entire subject that a consolidation of the statutes could never be efficiently effected until some plan wee devised by which the 40 volumes of statutes could be dealt 'with completely in such ainmaner as to lay aside all repealed, obsolete, and inoperative statutes, iselecting from the 3mas the statulte law of the landl which was in actual force and operation. It was suggested that the lawv should he divided into ulasss, and that those classe should be subdlivided into single Bills or Acts of Parliament, each class comprising some definite brmanh of law, and each Bill or Act of Parliament comprising one ent-ire subject. It was further suggested that an endeavour should be mnade to adoPt one uniform system of arrangement and hraseology, and that by the new statuLte-book, whict reduneed the Statute lawv from 40 volumes to four, the rudcis ineiige.staqu moles now existing should he converted into a well-arranged system of statutes, expressed in clear and intelligible phr;seology. Aft-er much anxious and laborious investigation by several members of the Statute Law Commission, after several reports from various members, and after full consideration of those reports, a schemeo for the entire and complete consolidation of the whole statute law of the united kinagdom was determined upon, and meastorea were takcen for carrying it into effect. At an early Period Of the last session he (~Sir F. Kelly) mioved for leave to bring in one or two con-,olidation Bills, and he thenx stated to the House-as well as he was able to do so before the scheme suggested had received the entire and final sanction of the Statute Law Commission -the plan upon which it was proposed to consolidate the statutes. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Locke King) was, however, maistaken in supposing that he had stated that the whole scheme would be carried into effect within 1S mnonths. What he sad was, that, if the Gov'ernment and the Crown would support the Statute Law Commission with the neessary funds and resources, and with their countenance and assistance Bills for the consolidation of the whole statute law of the realm might be passed through both Houses of Parliament within three years. It was now 15 months since he had mmade that statement, and he was prepared to repeat it with the greater confidence. A great numnber of consolidation Bills were already drawn, and some of them had been laid upon the table of the House of Lords; and he was enabled to say very confidently that if the Statute Law Commission obtainedl the supPort of the Crown, of Ministers, and of both Houses, there was no reason to doubt that in some 15 mnonths or two years from this time the whole statute law of England-and he hoped he might add of Ireland and Scotland-would be completely consolidated. He wished to make a few observations 'with regard to the criminal BUils. It occurred to the members of the Statute Law Commission that, inasmuch as the criminal law, begwin. ning as early as the reign of King John, and going down to Our own times, was in a state of great confusion and en-. cumberea with aUl the difficulties that belonged to the task of consolidation, it would be but fair to the House and the country if they were to begin with the criminal law ; and if theY found any difficulties attending the work which aPpeared insurmountable, that it wouldi be becominFin them to state to the House that they had met with those impediments, and that the whole undertaking must be abandoned. But, on the other hand, if they found on going through the whole of t-he criminal statutes from Magna Charta downwards that by patience, perseverance, and determined ap pication thes difriculties were not insuperable, they shoul be justified in stating that circumstance to the House;-and if theY were afterwards able to consolidate the whole criminal statute law of the realm, the same means by which that result had been attaned might be applied to the consolidation of other branches of the statute law. Accordingly, during the last year, they proceeded to consolidate the whole criminal statute law, It was true, as the haon. and learned gentleman had said, the Bills they hadl prepared as the result of their labours were transmitted to Ireland, but when he said those Bills had been returned by the authorities there with observations showing the impraticability of the undertaking, the hon, and lea-rned gentleman was labour'ng nder a, misapprehension. It was fouand, however, that the criminal statute law of Ireland differed so mauch from that of England that the two could not be consolidated on the same pla, n the result had been that the task -with reference to Ireland was now committed to per-sons perfectly competent to undertake it. There was no reason to doubt that as soon as it was determined whether or not to propose to Parliament the repeal of such statutes as constitutedI a substantia difference between the law of England and that of Irelaud, the consolidation of the criminial Statute law. of Ireland would be completed, as it was complete with respect to England. The dissolution of tha late Parliament prevented the Bills being brought forward with the hope of being carried in the short session which began within the present year, but they had now been laid on the table of the House of Lords by the Lord Chancellor with some insprrovemets, so that they were now in a fair way of being bOugh runder the consideration of both Houses of Parliament. Tho hon. and learned gentleman had said that he could point out many errors in this consolidation of the criminmal law. He wished that the hon. and learned gentle3man had stated the natare of those errors, so that those who had the charge of the Bills might know what they were. Those Bils had been prepared during an interval of three or four years by some of the maost eminent criminal lawyers at the English bar, and the commissioners believed that they were, at least, as free from error as a work of that kind could be expected to be, considering the nature of the undertaking and the difficulties with which it was necessarily surrounded. He believed those criminal Bills were now in astate to be pased through thie Hous of Lords, and that when they coame before the House of Commons they would receive its sanction and pass into a law. But, besides those eight criminal law Bills, there were 10 other Bills ready to be sutbmitted to the House, on some of the most. imnportant subjects within the compass of the law, but which he wrould not stop to enuamerate. There -was also another class of Bils now under the consideration of Vice-Chancellor Page Wood. They had, in fact, independent of the criminal law Bill, 46 Bills, either comapleted or in such a state of preparation that they hoped to submit a great part of them to; Parliament during the present session. Such. then, were the labounr of the Statute ILawCommission, which thebhon. and learned gentleman was so anxious to destroy. As to the question, of expense, he thought he might say the whole of this great work'might be completed at less than. one-half the cost which had been expended on one or two single Bils during the present session. He submitted that, upon a consideration of the circuamstances he had stated, the Sbtatut Law Commaissioners, so far from deserving the censurei which haa been cast upon them, might confidently appeal to Parliament and the conntry for their approval. (Rear, hear.) Mr. WHITESIDE said this discussion had come upon the House somewhat unexpectedly. The subject was one of great importance, and he was aware of tho industry, capacity, and knowledge which his hon. and learned friend (Sir F. Kelly) could bring to bear upon it; but he was afraid that the discussion, so far as it had gone, only went to prove the necessity of their having something like a Department of Justice, whose labours the House could appreciate. When the matter was last under discussion the late Attorney-General objected to the plan of the Statute Law Commissioners because he wanted to have a codification with consolidation' The Lord Chancellor proposed consolidation without codification, and the present Attorney-General argued in favour of a plan, which he ilustrated by reference to the civil law. It was true that those who laboured under Justinian accomplished in three years what they had to perform in 10; but that was a charge which would never have to be imputed to any mnodern reformer. (Laughter.) If it were intended to have one set of statutes for England, another set for Ireland, and another set for Scotland, the original evil would, in his opinion, be magnified threefold. (Hear.) He should certainly oppoe anypropositiontohave a separate set of statutes on the same subject for England and for Ireland. (Hear.) Having received a copy of the statutes on the criminal lavw, he carried the treasure to Ireland, and on the 30th of January put it into the hands of a uentloman porfectly familiar with the statute and criminal law, with a request to be told within what time it was possible to put the Bills, which contained literal copies of old Acts, into a shape whereby the law would be reaUy consolidated, amnended, and improved. The gentleman to whom he referred thought it could be done by the 1st of April; but, as to the Bills themselves, pronounced an unfavourable criticism. The plan seemed to him to perpetuate the evils which it was intended to cure, and only to lay the foundation for future work by coUlect- hat line would con9ider themselves very much aggrieved. A alagh.) He (Loru *J. Russell) admitted it was an inconvenience to exclude pecglls from the benefit of private study; but if the general ru.e was left as it was at preseat st the Museum, that no such fadflity should be granted, the trustees would give less cause of offonce to the great body of literary men frequenting the institution than by drawing en invidious discinction such as had been suggested by his bon. friend the member for Pontefract. (Hear, hear.) WVith regard to the gilded dome, the architect was first consulted on that subject before the gilding was undertaken, and he gave it as his opinion that it would be a great improvement, and would materially enhance the beauty of the building. i But before the expense was incurred he (Lord J. Russell) advised that the architect should go to the Treasury and consult the authorities there upon the subject. (A laugh.)j He did not think it was a question for the trustees. Thei Treasury listened to the representation of the architect, and ceitainly the result had been very much to heighten the effect of the structure. (Hear, hear.) Whether they bad not gone to an excess in that respect, so as to make the beanty of the huilding too much an object of interest to per. sr ns who resorted there for the purposes of study (a laugh), was a different question, on which some doubt mnight be entertained; hut aU those who had seen the new readingroom m,ust have been convinced, not only that it was extreirely handsome, but also extremely convenient and coDamodions (bear, hear), and great credit was due, in connexion with it, in the first place, to Mr. Panizzi, who was the first to saggest the erection of a building on so magnificent a scale; next, to Mr. Smirke, the architect, and, in the third place, to Messrs. Baker and Eielder, the contractors. He would only add that it was the wish of the trustees generally to make this great national institution as useful as they could in every respect to the public. (Hear, bear.) There was certainly the difficulty with respect to the working classes; but he hoped in some way or other they might have the advantage of seeing the building; for if the trustees could make the institution more accessible to that class of the population they would have the opportumity of study. ing the works of the Creator and of art with which it was stored with, it was to be hoped, the happiest results to tbemselves. (Cheers.) Colonel SYKES reminded the committee that a great public institution like this was supported out of the taxation of the country, and intended to aid in cultivating the minds of the great mass of the people. (Hear, hear.) While, therefore, he concurred in the opinion that every public in: stitution should be open to the greatest extent on week days, he was at the same time of opinion with other gentlemen who had addressed the committee that the Sabbath should be set apart for other duties. (Elear.) With regard to the alleged danger of lighting up such a buildingat night so as to make it accessible to the working classes after the hours of labour, he confessed he saw no cause for apprehension on that score, provided the edifice was lighted from the roof, on the same principle on which the House in which they were assembled was lighted. (Hear, hear.) The vote was then agreed to. Votes for 29,3141., in addition to 14,0001. already voted on account, for the British Museum new buildings and 9441. in addition to 6,0001. already voted, for purchases of objects for the Museum, were then agreed to without discussion. THE NATIONAL GALLERY. On the vote of 23,1651. for the establshment and expenses of the National Gallery, Lord ELCHO said, when this grant was under discussion in the last Parliament exception was. taken to the appointment of a secretary and of a travelling agent. He now wished to call the attention of the committee to the same subiect. Last year a member of the House moved that the estimate be reduced by the amount of the travelling agent's salary and his travelling expenses, which amounted together to about 1,0001. A comiimnittee of that House, which sat in 1853, recommended the appointment of a director, and that he should receive a handsome salary, buttheymade no seuchrecommendation with regard to the appointment of a secretary. But now the House of Commons was asked to vote 7501. for the salary of a secretary-a very excessive sum considering the duties. With a thoroughly efficient director a secretary could not have much to do beyond answering the letters about current business and the purchase of pictures, and certainly 750l. was rather an extravagant salary for this. (Hear, hear.) It might be said by the Secretary for the Treasury that he had a great deal to do, that he had arranged the Turner pictures, for instance. So he had, but Mr. Ruskin, who took as great aninterest in Turner as any man, had offered to perform that duty gratuitously, and no doubt he would have done it quite as well. The Secretary for the Treasury would say that he had to compile a eatalogue, but that could not be very hard work, inasmuch as previous to the new constitution a catalogue was in existence, drawn upby this samegentleman,aud thepurchases madesince wero comparatively tnfming. Mr. Murray, or Mr. Loungman, or any other publisher for 7501. down would engage to get up as good a catalogue as any one could want. Considering how long the hard-working curates and clerks in the publie offices must work before they get 7501 a-year-20 or 25 years on an average-this was rather too much to pay for a secretary, and he should move to reduce the vote to 5001. Next came the vote for the traveling agent. This was an appointment not recommended by the committee, and which had taken the House rather by surprise. It was discussed last year, and an attempt was made to get rid of it, but the proposition was rejected, and he then pledged himself to renewv the discussion this year. This traveling agent was appointed at the instance of the director, who was most anxious about him, and, in fact, made his appointlnent an V)tiszatum, without the concession of which he would not accept office himself. He expressed great confidence in this gentleman's judgment, but at the same time great diffidence, it was said. in his own. The appointment, he contended, was vicious in tbeory, and had worked ill in praotice. In the first place, it perpetuated to a certain extent the system of divided ,esponsibility, while the endeavour ought to be in all these instiltuions to get one responsible officer. Under the old cons itution there were trustees and a keeper equivalent to a direction. They did not go well together, and if mistakes were made the trastees throw the blame upon the keeper, and the keeper, in his turn, threw thelblame on the trustees; Eo in the same way now the responsibility was divided between the travelling agent and the director. Having befen in the course of the last winter in that part of Italy which the travelling agent and the director had been exploring, he had heard, though he could not vouch for the tiuth of the statement, of one or two instances in which this divided responsibility had led to works which would have been a great ornament to the gallery not being purchased. If he asked why such and such a picture was not parcbased, the answer was, I IOh, the directorwanted it, and the travellngagent didn't want it,"orviccvei s4. Lastyearthere was a great deal of discussion about the purchase of a Paul Veronese. That picture costl,5771., and hehadseensomething about it in the Official Gazette of Venice, which might bo presumed to be good authority, which would, perhaps, enable the committee to form some idea of the judgment shown in tbatpurchase. This picture came out of a church which was being restored; all the pietures were taken down, and permiusion was obtained from the Pope to dispose of them for the benefit of the church. The curate of the church rendered an account of what had become of these pictares, and he stited that, " Alter theocomplete restoration of the ancient temple of Pope St. Sylvester, some of the paintings which had decorated its walls had remained out of use since 1S37, and among them was a Paul Veronese representing the 'A doration of the Magi.' They were appraised by a commission appointet bythe Royal Academy of Venice, and the value set on them was 11,300 Austrian livres, or about 4001., and out of this sum the Paul Veronese alone was valued at 10,000 Aistrian livres, or 3701." And this was the picture for which thetravellingagentandthe tiiretor had thought themselves justi6ied in giving 1,5771. ("ll ear," and laughter.) Thatthis was the fulvalue of thepicture was pretty clear from the high price which, as everybody ubo had been in Italy knew, the Italians, and particularly the Venetians,were in the habit of setting on their pictures. And the picture itself, Eo far from being in a fine state, had been much repainted. It was, in fact, what was caUed a "mnined picture," and 661. was paid for its restoration to one of those professors who pretended to restore but invariably destroyed. It was well known by those who took an interest in these matters that the destructions by time, damp, and neglect were as nothing when compared with the destructions of theserestorers. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Brighton, writing on the restorations going on in our own gallery, said, "These harpies of restorers always fly at the face ;" but the harpies in this country were animals not nearly so savage in their propensities as those abroad; and, indeed, to do justice to those who had charge of our gallery, he was bound to say that the pictures in the galleries abroad were in a very much worse state than those in our gallery. (Hear, hear.) This purchase was a disgrace to our walls (hear, hear), and he would engage that if it were put up at Christie's auction-room it would not fetch 2001. (Hear, hear.) No doubt, good purcbases had been made; he admitted that. For instance, the Perugino which had been bought was one of the most beautiful pictures which he had ever seen. That there was a good grounA for the outcry which was made against these gentlemen was shown by the fact that whenever they made a good purchase not a word was said against them. Nobody complained of the purchase of the Perugino. Everybody, on the contrary, was delighted. "Have you been to the gal- lesy to see the new Perugino 2" was in everybody's mouth; and certainly it was a beautiful picture. So that it was really not from a disposition to cavil at the proceedings of these gentlemen that complaints were made, but simply from a feeling that the public money had been wasted. (Hear, hear.) This year the director and travelling agent had bouight anotber Paul Veronese, for which they had given 13,6501. The reading which he put on this purchase was this:-laving made a desperate mistake with their Paul Veronese last year they determined this year to buy a Vero. nese at which nobody could grumble. There was a Paul Veronese at the Pisani Palace which had a great celebrity, and that they determined to have. The sum which they had given for it was perfectly absurd. (Hear, hear.) Paul Veronese was a beautiful painter, who flourished towards the decline of the Venetian school; but, after al], he was a decorative painter; what people most admired of his were those beautiful celliDgs at the Ducal Palace and the altar-pieces in the churches at Venice. He did not inspire the same sublime emotions as Raffaelie's pictures. So that the country was paying this enormous sum for a second-rate specimen (for it was by no nmeans a first-rate specimen of Paul Veronese) of a second-rate artist. He did not deny that thero might not be a better specimen in Italy, but whether it was a first, second, or third-rate specimen it was perfectly absurd to give that price for a Veronese. Had it been a Raffaelle he should have had nothing to say. To show the opinion of the House on this purchase, and to teach the directors and the travelling agent to be more careful for the future, he should be very glad if some gentleman would nove that the sum of 5,O0M., wbich the committee were illed on to repay to the civil contingencies, should be refused, for it had all gone in this purchase. 10,0001. was annually granted fer the pur&ase of pictures, and the directors, having gona over their mark, were obliged to borrow 3,0001. frori She civil cositiugkencies. To show that it had all gone on tisil pictulre heo would read a fewr er,tracts from a letter of a wtl. known geetleinan, Ma. Ilorris Moore. He saw a smaile on several geatlemnse's a.f,o at this name-caused, no doubt, by the recolleicton i:A h>r.respoad.eace with Lord Btoomficld -but, without attdsoptinu to jtutify that gentlemsWs doaduct at Berlin, he would say that there was u arisa in England who was a beeWI' judge of pictures, or more conversant with Tbeir condition or market vala8, Having been in Venice for three montha, snd made inqtiries on the subject, he could teach for the accuracy of every statement in Mr. Moore's lef;er. The following wasthe account Mr. Moore gave of the way the mnoney went:- " The money given to Count Mrsaui was 12,3601.; banking commission to Mr. Valentine at4 per cent., 701. Corn. missions on the niceores-1, Signor Enrico Dubois, baukjr (son-in-law of Pisani), 62t. lOs.; 2, Carlo Dubois (banker), 621. lOs.; 3, Caterino Zen, Pisani's steward, 3001.; 4, Pietro Dezan, 2d idem, 2711. l0s. ; 5, Dr. AontprumicL lawyer, 27I1. lOs.; 6, Paolo Fabris, restorer, 2001.; 7, Giuseppe Conurato, Pisani's valet, 121.; 8, Caterina Rini, camereira (chambermaid), 101."1 He did not thuik that dear. (LInghter.) "' 9. Pietro Galperti, gondoliere, 61.; 10, AngeliniCornini, idefm, 61.; 11, Rticcardo de Sandre, cook, 61 (lauighter); 12, Pittro Dorigo, porter, 61.; 13. Angela Dorigo, porter's wife, 61. (Laughter.) He begged to read an emtract from the report of the director, Sir C. Eastlake, which would be found in the printed estimate. Sir C. Eastlake said:- " This picture, according to family traditions and the united testimony of tho historians of art, was painted by Paul Veronese for the ancestor of tho present Count Pisans. according to Bosrhini vast sums were offered for it two centurieg sinoe, and within the last 30 years Sovereigns, public bodies, and opulent individuals have in vain endeavoured to secure it. D' ArgenviUe states, on the authority of the Procuratore Pisani of his time (the firat half of the last century), that Paul Veronese, having been detained by some accident at the villa of the Pisani (at Este), painted and deposited there this work, informing the family after his departure, ' that he had left wherewithal to pay for the cost of his visit.' If this story be true the great painter has now munificently redeemed his word." He was dis posed to think, not that the painter, blut that the English director had munificently, or rather wastefully and foolishly, redeemed the painter's word at the expense of the public. (Cheers.) When in Venice the iquais de place came in one morning and said he had such a story to tell about the Paul Veronese picture. Mr. Miindler was in a state bordering on distraction. It had been arranged that the money was to be paid without an7 documents being signed as to the authenticity of the painting. When Conte Pisani sold the picture he would not part with the frame. It seemed absurd, but the secret had come out. There was at the villa at Este another picture by Paul Veronese, pre. cisely the same in subiect and in size, which would fit the frame Conte Pisani had kept. Mr. Miundler, neVer having heard of another picture, was naturally in a state of alarm as to which was the original, and he and the restorers were to undertake a pilgrimage to the viUla in order to ascertain the fact. Up to the present hour he was unaware of the result of that visit, though no doubt the Secretary of the Treasury would be able to give them a satisfactory explanation. (Cheers and laughter.) He did not propose to reduce the vote by the amount of traveliing expenses, which were estimated at 6001. He thought there must be some travelling expenses, but he did not think there was any necessity for a travelling agent. The director ought to be his own travelhng agent. The period for purchasing pictures was during the London season. The sales at Christie's, PhiUips's, and Foster's commenced in February and ended in June, and at those sales the best pictures were to be bought. No one had a finer collection than his hon. friend the member for Brighton (Mr. Coningham), and he believed he was correct in stating that a majority of those pictures had been bou'ht in London. But, as the object was to get a collection worthy of the nation, It was desirable that the director should also seek pictures elsewvhere. During the dead season of the year-during the winter-the director should travel in Italy-and be could not imagine a more pleasing occupation than travelling at the public expense in that beautiful country-in search of pictures. (Rear, hear.) The director could establish in every town in Italy a local agency, and by giving a commission would obtain information of every picture which was offered for sale. In that manner he thought the business would be better done. Mr. Milundler, by going about Italy, had spoiled the market. Wherever he went he was known as the agent of the English Government for the purchase of picture; prices rose a hundred-fold, and it was stated the Austrian Government had on this account issued iustruc. tions to the mayors of towns, heads of convents, and priests of churches, where fine works of art were to be found, forbidding them to give him admission. (A laugh.) Afar more effectual mode wouald be for the director himself to travel, and therefore he did not propose to reduce the vote by the traveUing expenses, which the nation would cordially nay, although 6001. a-year was somaewhat high, and it might possibly be that it was given to compensate for the lowness of the salary. He thought it his duty to bring the subject before the attention of the committee, and he believed that if his suggestions were adopted there would be a better chance of their getting good pictures. (Hear, hear.) Re therefore moved that the vote be reduced from 23,1651. 13s. 2d. to 22,6151. Ss. 2d. -being less the amount of the travelling agent's salary and the reduction of the secretary's salary from 7001. to 5001. a-year. Re would rather some other gentleman would move the reduction of the 5,0001. to be repaid to the civil contingencies. as some members might vote for his reduction and not for that reduction, and it was better to keep the two propositions distinct. (Hear.) There was one point which he had omitted to mention. Last year an Act was passed, empowering the directors to sell pictures and to remove them to other places. They had sold some pictures, which he believed were very bad ones, and they had likewise transferred some to Ireland. Re did not know whether the ILish members would approve of their National Gallery being made the refnge for the rejected pictures of the National Gallery of this country. lf the pictures were good they should be kept for the National Gallery, and if they were bad they should not bo sent to Ireland or anywhere else. (Hear, bear.) Mr. COX wonld not, like the noble lord, " hint a fault and hesitate dislike," but would go to the very bottom of the whole matter, for the statement of the noble lord revealed such a gross system of jobbery that ho would not only refuse the 5,5911. paid fromncivilcontingenuies, butthewhole 10,0001. asked for the current year. (Hear, hear.) Re followed the noble lord in his opposition to the salary of the Eecretary, for he thought 7501. was too much, and 5001. quite sufficient for thar official; but he knew that, accord. ing to the rule of the House, if he were to vote for the noble lord's motion it would be impossible for him to submit the motion which he himself wished to make. (gear, hear.) When a proposal was made in committee for a reduction in the estimates it was not permitted to any member to move that a lower sum be reduced, therefore he would go the extreme depths and leave it to others to rise to the top time after time as they chose to do so. He objected also to the travelling agent, and on that point would support the noble lord, bat he could not agree with him in allowing the travellingexpenses. (Rear, hear.) The noble lord admitted that paintinus could be more advantageously purchased in London than anywhere else. Rle (Mr. Ccx) was a Goth in such matters. (Laughter.) Ble knew nothing6ofpictures, but the noble lord did, and he said thebest place to purchase pictures was in the auction-room of Christie. For the very reason, therefore, that the noble lord had given he objected to the 6501. for travelling expenses, as there could be no necessity for going to the continent to get pictures. With regard to the picture to which the noble lord last referred, the letter from which he read stated that the Government had obtained not the original, but only a copy of that picture. (" No, no.") Lord ELCHO said his impression of the letter was that it did not say the picture at the Villa D'Este was the original ; nor did he. All ha said was that Mr. Mdundler had gone in a state of desperation to see the picture, but that to this hour he had never heard what conclusion he had arrived at. (RIear.) Mr. COX had been distinctly told that the picture was not an original, but a copy, and that we had left the frame hrhind for the original to be put in. (Hear, hear.) Was it not disgraceful that 12,0001. should have been paid by this country for such a picture ? (Bear, hear.) Then, there, were those extraordinary items paid by the purchaser to butlers and cooks and chambermaids. Why should he give 101. for a chambermaid? (Great laughter.) And not satisfied with that, ho must give 61. to a cook, and 61. for the cook's wife. (More laughter.) When he saw this item it puzzled him very much, for he could not conceive what a culinary professor could have to do with the sale of a picture, but it occurred to him that there was a goose to be cooked, and that, therefore, this sum was paid for cooking the British goose. (A laugh.) Sach extravagance as this was positi*ely disgraceful. It was not often that independent memboers were able to hit a blot like this (a laugh), but he believed there were many such blots in the estimates, if they could just get at all the facts connected with them. He moved that the vote boe reduced to 4,9741. Mr. WILSON hoped the committee would not be led away by the statement of his noble friend (Lord Eleho) or of the hon. gentleman who last spoke, for he believed he would be able to show by a faithful history of the transaction to which they had referred that this account wvas based cn a tissue of misrepresentations. If ever the Government exhibited care and caution with regard to the purchase of a picture thoy had done so on this occasion, and what they did entirely took away from Mr. Mundler the responsibility of that purchase. Many months before making a per. chase so important the Goverment. anxious that no misconceptions should prevail regarding it, communicated with Mr. Harris, our resident consul at Venice, and employed him to take the necessary steps for authenticating and securing the picture, and so far as Mr. Mundler and the National Gallery were concerned, he was bound to acquit them entirely of the transaction, and. take all the responsibility upon the Government. Several years ago this picture attracted the attention of the Government, and Lord Aberdeen authorized our consul to endeavour to effect a purehase of it. From time to time offers were made and rejected, and at last 12.00. was demanded by Count Pisani, to which heannexed this condition, thates his domestics had for a number of years obtained a large income by the fees,received for showing the picture, an additional sum should be given to compemsate them for the loss they would sustain by the stoppage of the fees. In these circumnstances the tota] sunm paid was 13,6501 Now, with regand to the amusing distribution of that money, so graphically described by his noble friend, Mr. Mundler had no concern whatever with it, nor, so far as be knew had Mr. Harris any concern vit L it. (Hear, bear.) All that was to be dene by the Goversment was to pay the eum agreed upon, and leave the distribution to o'bers. The hon. gentleman whs spe last appeared to be under an imureasion- which was justified, perhaps, hy the letter from weli he derivad his informatilon, but which nevertheless vwas incorrect-that Mr. MiUndler had been treating with all the domestie servants respectieg their particular shares. The fact w4sthe Government paid the m3oney stipulate'-, but had ncoWing to do with its distnibution. As to the value Qf the picture, that was perhaps a matter oE opiniss, which -could better be discussed after ;the pahiKin lad been exhibited in the National '.4allerL i He coi;bhody say that no one who bad viaited Venice ouldbe sw.acquaintted writh the fame of that Aicture.

LONDOD, FFJDAY, TULY 3,1857.

In the House of Commons, Mr. T. Duxco3mE moved, as a question of privilege, a resolution to the effect that where a seat shall have been declared by an Election Committee void, on the ground of bribery or treating, no motion be nade for the issue of a new writ without seven daye' previous notice. The SPzA&rmr was of opinion that this was not a question of privilege, and therefore was not entitled to priority over other motions. Aftef a short discitssioh it was arranged that tho totion should stand ad an otdinary 'notion, at the head of the orders of this day. n knthe order for going inCommitte6 bfSupply, Mr. WARREi Qed attention to s general ordoe
Lord Jozni RussanL, as one of the Trustees, last night discharged the annual office of stating to Parliament the claims of the British 31useum. He had simply to describe the progress of the 7building andL of the collection; the gifts and the purchases; the attendance of readers and other visitors; the questions pending as to the open -days, the payment of the servants, and such matters. In doing this he very justly *4eulogized the institution, and said a fewv words on the singular beauty and convenience -of the neow Reading-room. As this speech must be made every year, and is the usual preface -to a large demand on the purse of the nation, we *could wish that the occasion was taken to recomanend the MAuseum, not only to the generosity of Parliament, but also to the interest and use of the ;pople of England. Expected as we are to report scores of speeches every year on the advancement of .cience, the diffusion of knowledge, and the progress *oC9 art, we could well afford an appeal to the public .a large on the opportunities afforded them by our m=gnificent Museum. Few people are sufficiently ,,-are of its vast treasures, and the assistance it -wiMlgive towards any study or any pursuit. Every,+qdy, indeed, who visits the metropolis, and slinost evetybody who lives in it, have at some time or other spent half a day in a laborious pilgrimage to the building in Great Russell-street. If they ad made no mni%teke as to the day, they passed *hrgugh the handsome iEon gates, traversed the spcious court, mounted the coloalat portico, and, looking round the magnificent Hall and tairse, plunged into the interminable length of : Galleie and Saloons. Interminable we cal, themsnfe Ljondon and for the invariable effect on the visitor's 4si4li 2 Ia a tteniitoi. They are pothing, of course, to the Louvre; nothing to. Versailles; and. scarcely equal to the Courts of our own Crystal Palace. But by the time the visitor has traversed two Bides of the quadrangle on the ground floor, and all four sides-one of them twice over-on the upper floor, he feels that he has done a day's work, and someIthing more. He has seen a whole population of !statues and busts; fields of inscriptions, reliefs, and mosaics; tbe diggings of half-a-dozen ancient cities; the decorations of several temples; whole dynasties of Kings, monsten innumerable, and idols of all sizes, from an ear pendant to a maountain cut into shape. Re has seen the pillage of Pyramids, Catacombs, and Etrurian plains. Diving deeper into the past, he has seen a world of fossils, huge and uncotuth; the remains of everything that stalked, or climbed, or floundered, or dived, or scudded in some unk-nown state of things. Re has seen more minerals than he thought the earth held, and more stuffed birds, beasts, and fishes than BUFFON, AUDUDO-N, W'AERTrON, or GOouID ever met with or heard of. He has seen flights, and droves, and shoals, and swarms of all that flies, or walks, or swims, or creeps, or crawls. By the time he finds himuself on the Grand Staircase, which he saw from below two hours ago, not less than a hundred thousand distinct objects have been imprinted on the retina of his eye, to leave such mark as they could on the brain. He has gone through aU this in a warm atmosphere, with a multitude of people moving about him, footsore and eyesore, and the impression left upon him is generally such that, except to escort others, he never goes there again, and is content to remember half-a-dozen objects at the most out of the hundred thouisand. This may seem an odd way of recommending the British Museum, and so improving upon Lord JoaN PRussEiL's statement last night. The picture we give, however, describes an almost inevitable fact. As long as the world is w-hat it is, and people are what they are, a Museum also must be what it is-a very severe trial to the strength, observation, and memory of any ordinary person. This world is a very vast one, a very full one, and very miscellaneous. A Museum, therefore, which attempts to do it common justice must be equally oppressive and bewildering. It so happens that the British Museum is the most niscellaneous and comprehensive collection, we believe, in the world. Starting from the accumulations of a private collector, to whom nothing came amiss, and augmented, as chance might direct, with contributions from aU quarters, it has grown up like the British empire, the British Constitution, the British race, and everything British. It is a medley of aU things. What it wants, then, is the light and energy of powerful minds, not to reduce the chaos to order, for we believe that has been done long ago, but to illuninate, to adorn, and to relieve this vast store. It is a warehouse of scientific treasures; a huge chiffonnier of most interesting and valuable doposits. So far it is just such a place as we are all glad to have. When we hear of a great curiosity, or a precious relic, we are not happy til we hear it is in the British MIuseuma, and -when it is once there we are relieved and forget it. There is a comfortable doctrine that everything that is lost wliU be found in the moon; and the British TMuseum may be described as a Foundling Hospital for all natural, scientific, and historical discoveries. We cannot keep everything on our hands, so we are glad to shelve all matters of knowledge for which we have no immediate occasion. This tendency of the human mind to throw off its burdens into a vast receptacle, and this tendency of the receptacle to boundless and indiscriminate accumulation, alike suggest the necessity of continually throwing light on the MIuseum, tempting explorers, ant helping them in their discoveries. This may be said of aU national collections, but of none more than our Museum, and of no class of people more than our own. London is the capital of politics, of war, of business, of pleasure, of all that pertains to the government of a great empire and the resort of a wealthy nation; but it is not a University; it is not a metropolis of students,, of inquirers, of philosophers. It is too crowded, too busy, and too noisy for them. Yet such are the classes who alone can fully appreciate a Museum like ours. As in duty bound, Lord JouN RUssELL dwelt chiiefly on the new Reading-room, and the vast addition to the capacity of the Library and the accommodation of the reader. In this department, At least, there is no lack of that energy and intelligence that should be always vividly at work on the Museum, if it is to be popular and useful. Any respectable person can now spend all his days, summoning at his will the treasures of all ages and all climes, in the most magnificent and most comfortable room ever built or imagined for this purpose. We believe that even if a man combined the possession of millions and the opportunities of an AL.xANflnB or a NAPOLEOIT with the most voracious appetite for knowledge, he could not pursue his studies with more effect than in the British Mluseum. He could not have such stores at command ; such service so intelligent and prompt; such method so complete; so genial a temperature ; so solemn a calm ; and certainly he could nowhere on the earth find a Temple of the Muses so worthy in all respects of those graceful divinities. Considering the mines of money we throw away, and perhaps must throw away, with notlhing to show for them, it is some comfort to feel that we have our money's worth sometimes, and we certainly have in this instance. If anything can make Londoners studious, philosophical, or poetical, they will owe it to the new Reading-room ; though we admit there are difficulties in the way that might prevail even if Parnassus were planted bodily in Hyde Park and Helicons carried -tbrongh-the-'Serpentine; Unhappily, we cannot be everything, least of all that which requires such exclusive devotion. Is it necessary to say a word on the cost, or on the objection taken by a certain gentlem to the gilding of the vast aerial dome spread over the heads of the students? For our part, we could have wished to see it somewhat more decorated, even though it cost a few thousands more. It is worth lmoney to adorn and sweeten the unrowarded, but not less useful, pursuits of literture.
In the short interval whioh must still elapse, even with our improved commmunications, before the receipt of fresh intelligence from India, we are naturally induced to reflect with more than ordinary care on the causes or conditions to which the recent outbreak may be traceable. For its prompt suppression and for the restoration of an authority -which has ever been exercised for the benefit of Hindostan we must trust to the valour of our countrymen and the energy of our commanders; buit this pacification will not consummate our work, nor can we address ourselves with too much attehtion to the investigations which such events demnand. To, simplify an. inquiry now occupying the tboughts of thousands we have only to indicate a single feature in the case before'us. The outbreak, 'thoi4gh based? iccording to all infoimationr& upon a grieyance emphatically popular in its chamter, .4s in its ciunistances exekeimely professieal.

There are many disorders in popular as well as physical constitutions. which are none the less real for being founded in fancy; and if the flindoo really believes that his caste, and; with;his caste, his creed, are in danger of destruction, the symptoms of his panic would be just as serious as those of awell-grounded dread. Ithappens,however, that no Hindoos have been hurried into insurrection by these terrors except those in the military service of the Company. The strongholds of Elindooism on the banks of the Ganges, such as the great pity of Benares, have hitherto evinced no disturbance. The only instances of popular tumult have occurred at Meermt and Delhi, where the bulk of the inhabitants profess the Mahomedan faith, and where it was merely the lawlessness of a rebellious soldiery which gave the signal to the rapine of the mob. In the immediate vicinity of these towns several native Princes reside, under British protection, upon estates considerable enough to be described as provinces. In no partt of India, indeed, are there so many HIindoo principalities in a condition of partial independence. Yet these chieftains, one and all, have left the assumed interests of Hindooism to be asserted by the Sepoys alone, and have even placed at the disposal of the British Government the forces which, for purposes of pageantry or police, they have been permitted to retain. The same indifference, if not hostility, to the proceedI ings of the revolters seems traceable in the conduct of the educated and opulent classes of the nation generally, and, indeed, among the peasants as well, for while in no instance are the revolters represented as receiving assistance, 1 our officers, while escaping from the perils around them, have repeatedly found sympathy andprotection. In short, the more closely we scrutinize the outbreak the more purely military will it appear. It is not an insurrection; it is a mutiny. It is a rising, not of people, but of soldiers. The danger to the British Government proceeds, not from its Hindoo subjects, but from its own Bengal army. Here, then, we have our finger at once on the instrument of mischief, if not on the origin of discontent. Whether the Sepoys are making a mere pretext of their religious terrors-whether they alone experience these terrors-or whether, though all share the alarm, they alone are in a position to express it-we shall not stop to consider. The result in any case will be the samethat from the native army, and not the native population, our troubles have arisen.- We may go one step further, and say that it has been usually so. Popular tumults have been extremely rare in the history of British India ; but military mutinies, and still more frequently apprehensions of such catastrophes, are prominently recorded. The conclusion therefore appears to be, that we create the danger fox ourselves, and that in maintaining a native army we are imparting to a body of natives, through organization and equipment, the power, if not also the will, of revolting against our rule. As such remarks, however, would be applicable to any armed force thus situated, it obviously requires to be determined whether such an army is not indispensable, and whether the risks must not be accepted in consideration of the services required. This is the question which a well-informed corresp6ndent, under the signature of " M. P.," treated with signal frankness and decision in our columns of yesterday. The Empire of India needs an army. Against whom ? Not against the powerful and ambitious lieutenants of the Mfogul Sovereign. Not against. the Princes of the South, the Alahrattas of the. West, or the organized freebooters of the Centre. All these powers have vanished or are vanishing. Peishwar and Pindarees are forgotten; Oude and. Berar are British territory; and the representative of ScnrDuAsE was among the first to offer his contingent to the protecting Gvqgrnment afterth6 iMleerut massacre. Against whom, then, should we provide an army? If against foreign foes, experience has shown that there must be a large European leaven to insure the efficiency of the force. To what end, therefore, should we maintain a quarter of a million natives in arms when the want of any employment for them is said to be so great that the mutiny has been ascribed to their inaction, and when it is their organization alone which makes their discontent perilous ? When a dozen Indian Princes maintained as many Indian armies it was necessary for us. to maintain ours, and the very opportunity thus afforded for a contrast between our service and theirs conduced to the lustre of our replutation and the stability of our rule; but now that our native army is the only one in the country, with no standard of comparison before its eyes, and no occupation upon its hands, it incurs the natural temptations of pampered inactivity, and becomes extortionate and mutinous accordingly. Better, therefore, take advantage of the present occasion to disband at once all but the really loyal battalions ; reduce the army afterwards by degrees to a mere numerical equality with a largely increased European force ; and recruit for it, as can now readily be done, among races less encumbered with fanaticism and prejudices. Such are the views advocated by our correspondent. In some respects, and especially in the recommendation to augment the European army and constitute the native force rather of irregular than of regular corps, these opinions coincide with many others that have been advanced from quarters well entitled to authority. To a considerable extent, indeed, they are unimpeachable. An empire like India, however, must necessarily be garrisoned, and an extent of territory so vast must absorb a large numerical force even upon the most ordinary duties. Whatever constitution or organization may be given to the force, it appears to us, even with the advantage of railway communication, that large native levies will still be indisppnsable, and, indeed, the present army, with all its numbers, haq bpen constantly represented aX insifficient for its work, even when that work was little more than one of occupation. The increase o' the irregular force in the native army is a piece of policy recommended on its own nrerits and supported by strong arguments. An irregular corps is not merely raised from outlying populations, such as the Sikhs, Ghoorkas, or Beloochees-themselves entirely distinct from each other, and all alike strangers to the peculiar passiona of the Eindoos-but it is officered after a morepatriarchalanddespoticfashion, the commander arcd his colleagues, though but two or three in nuriaber, being invested with a more arbitrary power than in the battalions of the Line. The reslat is, that the relations anciently prevailing betweea the European officer and the native $oldier are more faithfully represented in these regiments than | in others, while the caprices of Brahminism are escaped. Such are the suggestions most prominently put forth. That they, as well as others, will receive due consideration at a crisis like the present niay be safely presumed; and if an improved organization of our Indian Army should conduce no4 only to the prosperity of our Eastern dominions, but the general stability of British power, we may have reason to look back to the rrutiny of 1857 with sorrow, indeed, for its imme- diate eonsequences,, bu with some ratisiaction for. the olicy it prod=eai.

Butchers now sBit on Juriei, and felons no longer hold up their hands at the bar. Deodands are to the risi generation a 3nedizeval superstition. JolNx DOE and RICnDtun ROE have ceased from their inmmemorial feud. But there is one relic of the dark ages which still maintains its ground-the starvation of Juries.' There may, indeed, be something agreeable to the archxological mind in this rough practice of our ancestors. 'It has evidently come dowvn from those good old Saxon times when the "tvwelve" could not be trusted with ale and maead during their deliberations, for fear of injuty to their powers of discern- l ment. But now-a-days the usage is nothing but a hardship to the juror and an injustice to the litigant. By the law of England the 12 meon who are clarged with the determination of a case, when they retire from court to consider thei; verdict, are committed to the care of an usher, who is bound to let no one speak to them nor to speak to them himself, and to deprive them of meat, drink, and fire until they shall [have given their verdict. The results bf this system are sometimes ludicrous, but more often painful. We will not say that prisoners are often convicted through the unwillingness of jurymen to brave a night of hunger and discomfort, for, as the judge has charged them. to give the prisoner the benefit of any doubt, the worst that can happen is that a reprobate is once ,more let loose on society. But in civil causes -it is very different. There the qluestion is nDt between the community and an individual, -but between one individual and another.- The conscientious joryman cannot venture to compromise -matters by leaning towards' plaintiff or defendant; if he favours the V one he -injures the other, and unless he would lay perjiry on his soul he must hold out to the last for the opinion which he has formed. Now,'though it is manifestly the duty of everY citizen to serve when called upon as an -arbitrator in his neighbour's disputes, and to give -his verdict with- the same honesty as he 'would expect from another, it is somewhat too much to demand that he- should endanger health and everi life in weighing another man's pecuniary rights. Any name on the list is objected to if its bearer has the- slightest interest in the cause to be tried; aU the ingenuity of- attorneys and clients -is exerted to striko off every luau who may be sUpposed to have a prejudico for the opposite side; it m3Y therefore be concluded that on the- whole the jury is an impartial body. But how are these 12 nmen who are sworn to do right and have no interest to do otherwise treated by the law ? One )vould think that their conscientious disagreement after a certain limited time vwould be held *ufficient to warrant their discharge, and that if they could not agree in two or three hours the case might fairly be considered as insufficiently elucidated by evidence, and as thereforo demanding further examination. How ' different the actual practice is from this is- showxn in the- case "Fs ELxyru v. Muray," Etried before LoTd CSIPBELL oa Tuesday. The jury were unable to agree in their verdict, and retired to deliberate at half-past 1 o'clock. At 5 o'clock the CHIEP JusTrIB sent for them, when the Foreman said that they had not agreed and that there was no chance of their doing so. Two of the jurors differea from the other ten, and no i arguments of his own had been able to convert the recusant pair. He, himself, he said, lived at 'ampnptead, andin order to be in time for "the sit"ting" of the Court he had left home that morning without his breakfast. Lord CAiapEy,m, of course, merely stated he law for the satisfaction of the exhausted jur.' -Ee had no power to change what was positively provided. The jury must be lacked up again, and under the enlightening effects of imprisonment they would, no doubt, come to an understanding. The Foreman then blufitly declared that - he was ' physically incapable. of giving any more attenlion to the case. The jury, he said, were not permitted to have the slightest refreshment, and his health would be much endangered if he were con-' fined any longer. Another jturor complained of serious illness. " I am very sorry for your " sufferings," said Lord CAM-PBELL, ", but I cannot " assist you. I must ask you to retire again."1 After another remonstrance from the Foreman, a juror begged that they might be allowed something tp eat, and then they would see what they could' do. - Lord CAMPB=ir coild not entertain this proposition,' but was willing, if there was no objection from the parties, to discharge the jury. The defendant consented to this, but the plaintiff would not hear of it. The most that could be extracted from the - latter was that the jury should be supplied with refreshments. The defendant consenting to this the jury were again ordered to their rooma, with the understanding that they were to be supplied with moderate refreshIments, but that no. stimulaats or tobacco were to be allowed. At last, towards midnight, they agreed and rewarded the more humane of the parties-the defendant-with a verdict. No one can deny that such a scene as this is somewhat too farcical for a Court of Justice in our day. The endeavour to extract a verdict respecting the right to sell a house by locking up 12 respectable men all night reminds one more of the rude procedure of savage tribes than of anything which prevails in a civilized country. -Be it observed, also, that in a criminal case the refreshment which the jury in " ELKTNS V. NUPPHY " received could not have been allowed. There are continually instances of a jury being shut up all night on a trial for felony and. discharged in the morning withouta verdict, after more-than one of the jurymen has been brought to the point of exhau1tion.. In the caze of O'l)oninrTY, the Irish rebel :of 1848, two Juries, if we remember aright, were thus discharged. It is difficult to believe that in any cause, civil or criminal, the ends of justice have been. forwarded by the denial of suStenance and warmat to the men intrusted witlh the pevfbrmance of an arduous duty. To- our progenitors of the dark ages, who believed implicitly in bone and sinew, it was nat'cral to think that the men who fomed the most hones,opinion would be those who cbuld hold out most easily against a 24 hours' fast. But we, in our day, have Marnt, whether rightly or not, to believe in a disintegration between brain and stomach. An acute peraeptio3a, a logieal intellect; or a large acquzintance with business and its rules, may be founa in conjtunction with a weak digestionor a consumptive chest.

THE QrUEBN'.S DEPARTUBE FROM WORSLBY. The Queen left Wborley Ril, the teat of the Earl of EUesmere,. at about 15 minutes past 8 o'clock yesterday morning, and the Royal train left the Patricroft station for London at half-past 8. The time was originally fixed for half-past 9, but ':Her Majest y came to the resolution of starting an hour earlier on the previous day, and the railway company had to make the requisite changes in their traffic arrangements.. Her Majesty was accompanied by the' Prince Consort, the Prince of 2mussia, the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, Princess Royal, Princess Alice, and Sir George Grey. Great numbers of* people had assembled at the station soon after 9 o'clock to witness the departure of the Royal visitors, but of course were disappointed. (From the Cou,t CircuZa:.) The Queen and the Prince Consort returned to Buckingham Palace from Worsley Hall, near Manchester, at 20 .ainutiS before 3 oclock yesterday afternoon. Her Majesty' and his Royal Highness were accompanied by the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, Prince Alfred, the Princess Alice, and Prince Frederick William of Prassia. In attendance were Lady Churchill, the Hon. Eleanor Stanley, the Lord Chamberlain, Colonel the Hon. C. B. Phipps, Major-General the Eon. C. Grey, Colonel F. H. Seymour, Baron do Moltke, 2ir. Gibbs, and Lieutenant Cowell. The lloyal party proceeded from the Ruston.square terminus of the London and North-Western Railway in several of the Qaeeres carriages, and escorted by a detach. ment of Light Dragoons to Buckixighbai Palace, where the Queen and the Prince Consort were received by the Lord Steward, the Master of the Horse, the Vice.Chamberlaiu, Sir Frederic Stovin, aud Colonel Francis Seymour, C.B.

RoYAL Acnxwr BtLr.-The annual g-and fancy dress ball, in aid of the friends of the Royal Academy of Music, took place last night in the Hanover-square rooms. The company was brilliant, about 500 persons being wasembled when the ball was at the fullest. The Earl of Westmorland, chairman of. the Royal Academy committee, was unablelto attend in consequence of domestio privation; while the Duchess of Wellington and' Lady Jersey only remained a very -hvrt time. Nevertheless, the affair passed off in a most satLsfactory manner. Dancing commenced about 11 o'clock, and was continued with the utmost animation til a late hour. The grand features were the quadrilles organized respectively by the Marchioness of Bly and the Countess of Craven. Both performances excited the utmost admiration. The orchestra, under the direction of ML Laurent, was excellent, as usaal. This annual ball deserves the aristocratic patronage it obh tAns, since it adds to the resources of an institution which, though it has effected a great deal of good for music in this country, has never-for reasons unnecessary to state horebeen ma very flourishing condition. THE MNEDLM oF MB. IrmE.-Some fresh discoveries were made on Wednesday by the police. A razor, marked " James Spollen," has been taken out of tho basin of the canal just opposite that portion of the railway terminus in which the office of the cashier is aituated, and a f urther small sum of money has been discovered adjacent bo the spot I where the larger usns were f6uhd last week. Hlow far these additional proofH. may be rendered available towards perfecting .the evidence against the accused time alone can tell, bnt, as no allusion whatever wasmade to the razor inthe tonrse of the adjourned investigation, an impression Daturally prevailed that at present, at least, ths authorities regarded its discovery as a matter of secoudary importance. FiM MAIntBGrABLs PnimmSS.-The &dde publishes the following' article; which. it heads "Filfty Marriageable Prinesa q :-'-" A Qernn nawapap, the Bruniswick GazcUet, states in a late numbez that these exist at the present moment-not in the wshele world, not even in Europe,,but in Germany alon'e-o0 princessea of an age to. marry.

PBrIRESS THEATBE. The manher ini wlch the, Tempest is performed at thi, house is marked by the most complete originality of design on the part of tho manager. The large ship, filled withL living perz0ns; thit isloisea about en canvass waves at the coPmmencenment, is not, indeed; without precedent, but frgnm the moment when Frospero is fist discovered with Mirjsda to thc momnent when he takeshis final leave of the audie4ce every group is execisted after' a fashion altogether 3adev Instead' ,of standibg on the level sinds to hear the )Oar.of the depairting 4tempest," the Magician andahig daughter watch the subsiding waters from the edge of: a projecting rock. Instes4 of speaking the " epilogue" at the footlights, Prospero delivers it from the ship itself, whiph glides from the stage when the apologetic speech is ended.. Fspecial pains have been taken to endow Ariel with those attributes that alvrays suggest themselve6 to the student of the play in the closet, bat have never been exhibited on the atage. To sustain the charactef of Ariel as a vocalist t,ha etheris spirit has hitherto been divested of his %lightite4s, and a subitantial full-groxwn lady has been supposed. f to tread the ooze of the salt deep: To run iupoa the Eharp rind of the north. In the Princess Tempast, on the other hand, 'we have- a juvenile Ariel in the person of Miss Kate Terry, and while she floats before the picture the music is sung behind the scenes ay Miss Poole. To heighten the illusion every sort of mnechanical and optical contrivance is adopted. An electric light accompanies the spirit wherever he strays ; hedarts swift as thought across the sky without any visible means of movement, and every time he appearS it is from th;e corner where he is least expecte& AU parts of the sublunary world are equally permeable to Ariel, and consequently in all parts of the scene he can fild with equal facility an entrance and an egress. The costume of the spirit is likewise ndw. 'When'he leads Firdinand across the" yelow sandi' he indeed wears the ordnary. attire of' sea*nSmph, but his habitual aspect is that of a semi-cele3tial beiagvwith wingsof the angelielind. AsArielistheever-pro,minent personage thronghon.t the' ction, to does he xemaih 'Sole occupant of the stage at the end of theplay. Psosperohas spoken his epilogue, the ship has glided off, the islnd slips aviy in the opposite direction, and al that remiins is tVa expaDse of vvateis over *hich Ariel is swspenddl, e9tDtinfr in bis newly acquired liberty. This is, perhaps, one of the nostL poetical ideas ever embodied by means of Stage CoD.- trivance. In the scene where Alonzo aadl-is compmionrsare tamt. lize'd with the show of a feast through the magical arts of Prosperb an extraordindr effect is prdduced. A. picture ot mere barreauems, in which two witbered trees ire the prin- elpal objects, is gradually cianged into oneofluxuriant vegetation, the foliage actually growing before the eyes of the spectator. The" Etrange shapes" vaguely indicated by Shakspeare are interpreted by Mr. Kean as the nymphs and satyrs of antiquity, and naiads, who dance on the dface of undulating waters, joia them in their revelds The old $fashitnm of ' makingt a' tablo rise from a trapdoor is abolished, and the nympht, who carry baskets of fruit on their heads: bring them together, so that they themselvesform the table, the illusion being perfected by t)Ae festoons of flowers that conceal their figares, -rhile they' crouch beneath the load of, conglomerated dainties. Th.e classical character given to this scene is in harmony with' the masque in the fourth act, in lvhich the speaking person-i agesareJuno, Ceres, and Iris. Of course, thls masquet brings with it another struing tideau, and flying figures,' apenaded on the principle already adopted vith so much' success in Faust and Jlrargue4te' and Hen7ry VIII., float: amid brilliant light, while Miss Poole, gorgeously attired as the Queen of the Gods, and accompanied by radiant pea: cocks, varbles forth her song of gratulation. - Wha*ever may be eaid to the contrary, the serious cha.. ractets in the Tempest afford no opportunity for very remarkable acting; and whsen we say that Miss Leclereq as' Miranda and Miss Bufton as Ferdinand both looked exmcedingly beautital, and deported themselves with exceeding grace, we have said that they did aU that was required. of them. The great Prospero himself has only toappear extremely dignified, and to feign much more dogged. ill-nature than really belongs to him, but, nevertheless, we have seldom heard a more perfect specimen of quiet decla- mation than the "epilogues" as spoken by 3ir. Charles' Xean on Weduesday night. A hitch had taken place in the machinery, and had occasioned an unexpected pause in the performance, so that the words llelease me from my bands W"itl the belp of yoer gool haeds *Gentle breath of your my sails "Must fill. or else my project falls, - - Which was to please . might be construed as a sort of add ress from the manager himself to the audience, and were thus endowed with extra.nrdinary pathos. They were answered with enthusiastic icciamations, and when the ship had departed,and the betutiful figure of Ariel remained sparkling against the sky, il remembrances of impatience were forgotten in a general sensation of Lamiring wonder, and calls for " Kean" arose on all sides. * Mr. Ryder's Caliban is a fine picturesque savage, and Mr. Harley is at home in the quaint ple:ksantry of Trinculo, but Stephano is susceptible of more weight and unction than is given to him by Mr. F. Matthews. But the effect of the comic portion of the plxy is in some degree marred by the long pauses which ensae between the acts, and which, notwithstauding a notice affixed to the doors of the theatre, craving the indulgence of the public, relax in some degree the powers of attention. No doubt pauses of more than ordinary duration are inevitable, for so complicated is the machinery of the piece that-as the notice tells us-more 'lon 140 operatives (unseen by the audience) are cetployed in working it; but still we would recommend that every effort should be made to reduce them as much as possible.
OLYjMPIC TZHATRE. Last night a smart Ilvely burlesque, entitled alfasanidlo; cr, t/c .Ffsh'oman of AraplW, was produced at this theatre with unequivocal success. The plot, as may be supposet. is taken from the book of Lae Afuete di Porm6ei, but the author, Mr. Robert Brough, while closely following the action of a long opera, so as not to omit a single incident of importance, has most dexterously avoided everything like tediousness, and on the fall of the curttin ODn is surprised to find how much has been done eithin the linits or a not very long act. The character of Massaiello is, of course, played by Mr. Robson, and the great scene is the last, in which, under the supposed in9lnence of poison, this truly original actor sings snatches of bis old songs, and expresaes the frantic emotions of his mind by dances terribly grotesque. Finally, in the couse of his delirum, he fancies himself a sbrimp, and in the ditty which illustrates this extraordinary haucination he contrives by his voioe aDd gesture to convey a notion of infinite smallness and insigiifncance. But the character throughout is admirably conceived. Br. Robson really becomes the light, sportive, penniless man of the South, with quick sensibilities and supple lunbs, and seems to live in a region of tarautellas, tls khe chooses to stop short and sing an air to the tiue of " Poor Dog Tray" with the twang of a lordoz itinerant vocalist. The wronged Fenella is played by Mademoiselle Heckman, a French dancer, whose feats, gravely executed, -were tendered comic by the signifi. eance of the tanes. Mr. G. Cooke, as a Neapolitan caricature of a London policeman, who afterwards joins the insurgents, is an amusing personage, whose kitchen amours serve to relieve the moze portentous drolleries of Masaniello, and' for the elegant figures of the picture we have Miss Swanborough, Miss ThirwaU, and Miss Hughes, beautifully at. tired as Alpbonso,Lorenao, and EMlvi and nstterimg aU sorts of pleasant sayings. Indeed, in studding over his dialogue with jokes ir. Brough has been most unwearied and impartial, and Inany was the hearty laugh he gained in the course of the evening by the force of his verbal wit alone. Although the piece is a burlesque, the scenery is painted In an earrest spirit, and the Neapolitan views are as bright and sparkling as possible.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES-OFPIC, Fridnay Moritig. EXPIRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre*pondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m.:- The conspiracy of a certain number of Italians against the life of the Emperor, to which I alluded tome days ago, seems to be marked by a more serious character than was originaUy supposed. The rersons taken into custody are also more numerous; successive arrests, either in consequence of discloaures made by accomplices or obtained from papers found at their lodgiugs, have increased the number from three to 21; I doubt whether it will rest here Their examination by the Juges d'Instruction is still going on, and it is said that abundant proofs exist of their culpability. Few authentic particulars have transpired as to their plans or the modes by which these plans were to be carried out. The main object, however, was to get rid of the Emperor; the overthrow of the Imperial 2fiXemc would follow as a matter of course, as well as the re-establishment of the Red Republic. Every Italian, who attempts to poniard a Sovereign is classed by public opinion as a disciple of Mazzini, wbose opinions on political crimes of this kdnd are known. It is not surprising, then, that the present prisoners should be considered as of the same school. Whether M. Mazzini will recognize them as his own I cannot say. I have, however, heard that theic opinions are much more advanced even than Lis; and that they look upon him as little better thau aReactionist. 'rhey belong to the same school as Pianori, and their object is the same. They are also said to be connected with the conspirators arrested in Genoa who proposed to proclaim the Republic in that city. This, I think it right to add, is the account given by official people, who appear to have no doubt, frum the documentary and other evidence in their possession, of bringing the matter home to them. They will be tried by the Court of Assizes of the Seine. A few who, except on the clearest and most undeniable proof, are generally increda. lous in those niatters, dwell on the coincidenlce of this new plot against the Emperor and the elections, as if got up by the police with a view to excite the fears of the i'o"rgcoisie. This I hardly believe ; such a game is too dangerous to play. We have a telegraphic despatch from Turin, of the 2d, which announces as follows:- " TURIN, JULY 2. "An insurrectional attempt at Leghorn has been put down. Tfe steamer Cagliari, which left Genoa for Tani-, and fell into the hands of the insurgents, attack-ed the island of Porza, belonging to the Neopolitan Government, rand set at liberty the prisoners who were detained there. She insurgents and the released pzisoners then landed in arms at Sapri, in the lower principality. The Cagliari was afterwards captured by two Neapolitan frigates, and troops sent in pursuit of the insurgents." Letters from Elorence of the 28th give further particulars respecting the precautions adopted by the policeO at Pisa during the fete of the Lumi. naria. No spirituous liquors were allowed to be served in the public-houses until af ter 1 o'clock in the morning. Patrols traversedthestreets, andwhenmore thanthreepersonswereseentogetherthey were atonce dispersed. Several private dwellings were converted into guardhouses, to the no small surprise of the prourietors, for when these returned from the theatre they found sentries at their doors, who at fir.t refused to allow them to sleep in their beds. The following day, while the religious procession was passing the great square at Leghorn, a chair fell, which caused some alarm, and the troops on duty prepared to charge. The inhabitants of the neighbouring villages were commanded by the police not to go to i'isa, and several young men were arrested at Pistoja who refused to obey. The letter from which these particulars are derived concludes by announcing that the Tuscan Governmaent had appointed to the vacant Sees four Bishops, who have been approved by the Pope. They are-Md. Imberti, Vicar-Generaland Rector of the College of Prato, to the Archbishhopric of Flurence; M. Targioni de Prato, t'. the hishopric of Volterra; M. Antonelli de F]3igline to the l3ishopric of Fiesole; and M. Paoletti de VolterTa to that of Montepulciano. O()icial accounts have been received irom Athens announcing the nomination of General Kalergi am Bdinister PlenipotentiarytoParis. I mentioned the probability of that nomination some days ago. Private letters from the same city speak of the increased interest attached to the question of the suc cession in consequence of the visit of the Queen to Germany. Her Majesty is naturally anxious to enjoy some repose after the toils and fatigues of Government, and to renew familiar intercourse with her family. The main purpose of the visit is believed at Athens to be connected with a subject vhich has the greatest claim to her attention, and which, however it may for the present be cast in the shade by events of higher importance, is not without interest, and will have to be decided sooner or later. The Constitution by which the kingdom of Greece has been governed for more than 14 years, and which has been ratified by the Protecting Powers, preEcribes that the successor of King Otho u;st belong to the religion professed by the Greek people. So stronjgly is this feeling expressed by the nation that any attempt to annul that condition ' ould be attended with general discontent, and, probably, give occasion for fresh and more serious troubles. It is clear that the King's brother, Prince Adalbert, does not mean to purchase a throne by conversion to the Orthodox faith, and, consequently, that some other successor must be found to the present Sovereign, who is childless. The Greek Constitution accords to the Sovereign the right of choosing a successor, but the Western Powers may also claim the right of approving the choice of His fiajesty, the Charter of 1843 having been recognized and approved by them, and of pro. viding that the selection shall be one which shall not affect the general interests of the country itself, nor facilitate the re-establishment in the East of an influence which would be hostile and pernicious to themselves. England and France cannot be indifferent to the manner in which King Otho exercises the right granted to him by the Constitution. The question is surrounded with difficulties. The jealousies that would arise from the seleotion of a native Greek, if a man of sufficient merit and influenos could be found to fill the high post, would probably counterbalance the advantage of his being of the same race and the same faith; and the manner in which King Otho has exercised his rule gives no great hope that another stranger would not postpone the interests of the country that adopts him to family attachment and an hostile influence. It is known that the Queen has for a long time past cherished the hope of placing her brother, the Prince of Oldenbarg, on the throne of Greece; to the attainment of that object all her energies and powers of intrigue are directed, and it is generally believed that during her visit to Germany on the present occasion she will do her best to realize that darling object. On the score of religion there wotuld probably be no objection from the house of Oldenburg; but it is for the Western Powers to decide whether any member of a house so closely allied to the Imperial Family of Russia, and Eo devoted to it, would be a prorer person to place on the throne of Greece. . The following private telegraphic despatch has been received "BERNE, JULY L "#The Gr&nd Council of NeztliAtel has deed t4t the rteision of the Constitution shall not take place until the Government shall have given an account of the situatioa of affairs. " The Grand Council has pronounced its opinion on the questions raised in 1856, and a commission has been appointed to support the demand for civil damages for the expenses caused by the events of September last, and which have fallen to the charge of tho Canton of Neuchdtel." A letter from Toulouse, of the Ist instant, says that the weather continues most favourable for the crops. The great heat during last week has considerably advanced the maturity of the wheat. The heads are yellow, and promise an abundant produce. The harvest will commence this week in the neighbourhood of Toulouse. For rye, barley, and early oats a superabundant produce is expected. The vines are loaded with grapes. The oidium is vanquished. The starms have produced a partial effect, such as occurs every year. Travellera arriving at Toulouse from all parts of France are unanimous in declaring that the crops this year are, in point of quality, exceptional.

The politicians of Germany have at length got a little bit of politics to go on with, or they must soon have entirely given up business for want of materials. The long-expected Danish answer to the last despatches of the German Powers of the 20th ulthas at last been delivered in Berlin and Vienna. These documents, according to an oftcieuxr article in the IV ordischer (orier, contaia no longer the bold language ascribed to them in certain telegraphic announcements we received about a fortnight back, but are " simple answers," of which, however, no other indication exists anywhere than that they repudiate the meaning put upon their precursors by the Austrian and Prussian Cabinets. There appears, in fact, to have been a note drawn up and agreed to by the Danish Ministry pretty much of the nature formerly described, but at the last moment wiser counsels seem to have prevailed at the deliberations of the Privy Council, at which the King presided, and a milder form was adopted. This improvement of matters is attributed to representations made by Russia as to the inexpediency of driving matters to extremities with the German Powers, and the desirableness of making further attempts at a conciliatory solution of the difficulty. The French Cabinet also has made some representations to both parties tending to prevent a breach of the European peace-to the German Powers, begging that Denmark might not be so hard run as that there should be no opening left for conciliatory concession; and to Denmark, the most earnest exhortations to agree to the just demands of the German Powers, and to do anything rather than that the matter should be brought before the German Bund at Frankfort. According to Danish accounts, the Finance Minister, Herr von Andrae, and the Minister of the Interior, Herr Krieger, who were the authors of the late abortive draught of a despatch, as well as of its predecessor, were not present at the Ministerial Council at which the last despatches were agreed to. I can send you no information from here of so deep interest to the inhabitants of these parts as the fact that yesterday and the day before the country was blessed with some rain, and there are now some grounds for hoping that some portion of the corn will be found at harvest-time to contain grain; the ears of the greater part in this neighbourhood are quite empty as yet. As the mail train for England was leaving here yesterday afternoon a young lady stepped forward on the platform of the railway to bid a parting friend a last adieu, when her dress caught in some way, and she was drawn down between the carriages and the platform with her legs across the rail. The whole train thus passed over her, not only seriously injuring the upper part of her person, but cutting off both her legs just below the knees. Towards the close of last week the Prussian Minister in Paris, Count Hatzfeldt, concluded with Ferul-Khan a treaty of commerce, &c., between Prussia and the other States of the Zollverein on the one side, and Persia on the other. The Emperor and Empress of Ruesia reached Darmstadt without any accident whatever on Monday evening. The Grand Duke Michael, who landed, with his brother and sister-in-law at Kiel, separated from them vezy early, and hastened on to Carlsruhe, where the Princess Cecilia of Baden is now residing. ITALY. (FROX OUR OWN CORREsOPNDENr.) 1NAPLES, JuITX 25. I have often had occasion to speak of the immense corruption prevailing in the public offices in Naples, resulting fromthe class of men selected,from the motives of their selection, and from the insufficient salaries which are paid. A direct official proof of my assertion has recently fallen into my handu in the form, as it is alleged to be, of a circular from the 'Minister of Finance to the different emlnloy6s in his Administration. It runs as follows ' Mixs;rTr.y or Fx.Xcp. "I learn with regret that certain officers of the Royal Treasury permit the despatch of affairs to be sold at a price, and do not hesitate to demand and accept compen. sation on payments being made. " Inexorable as I am in the energetic and exemplary repression of such crirninal practices, I would interest your well-known zeal to expose the names of those who abandon themselve3 to this species of corruption, in order that thay may be deprived of office, and given up to the rigours of the law. I beg also that you will demand the half-yearly report of the officers of each department from the heads of he same, making it known to them that ignorance of the mal. practices of their subordinates, and neglect in watching over them, will fall upon themselves; and I shall not refrain from making among them examples of rigour, adapted to enforce more scrupulous performance of their duty, and to discover every fault of the chiefs of offices, or of the subordinates attached to their respective departments. "I await an acknowledgment of this circular and an assurance of the fulfilment of it. "U RENA, "The Minister of Finance. " Naples, March 14, 1857." aIam assured that this is a faithful copy of the Ministerial circular, and, though it betrays a frightful state of corruption, it by no means astonishes those who can argue from causes to effects, or who know the history of this country. These pvils are the inavitable consequence of the eystem pursued. So long as public office is the reward of those who sup- port a dynasty and a system without reference to capacity or principle, so long will such men regard office as theirs by right and not by sufferance -something to be held, and exhausted for the, special good; and, though a Minister may threaten, he who is above the Minister dares not see justice done. So long, too, as the salaries attached to office are scarcely large enough to keep body and soul together, so long men will plunder and hold themselves justified in doing so. Infact, almost all the employ's in the public offices of the Two Sicilies may be compared to the servants in gre3t hotels In England, who have no salaries, but live on perquisites; the only difference being, that in the latter case the perquisites are honestly gained-in the former they are what they may be inferred to be from a Ministerial circular :-" How can we do otherwise ? It has been often urged to me 'we are driven to it, we must live.'" Thus corruption and dishonesty are the necessities of a system, and economy is exercised at the expense of the national character. "See how flattering is our financial state," exclaim the defenders of Royalty; " we make no loans-have not made any for an age." It may, or may not te true, but the financial character of the State has been based on a delusion, and on corruption which has eaten into the very heart of the country. The circular which Ihave published above is limited to the Finance Department in the Two Sicilies, but a similar, or even worse exposure, might be made of every other branchof theAdministration. Of course it will be regardedasindicative of ameritoriousdesire to correct admitted evils, but little faith can be reposed in that desire so lona as the system which generates the evils is persisted in. The one is necessary to the other-no change can takeplace, though circulars were issued every hourin theday. It iswell known that flagrant iustances of corruption are discovered and passed over. The only concession which I observe in Naples is the involuntary one of yielding somewhat to the spirit of the age, and acknowledlging the power of the press. I am told that a Frenchman has been presented to His Majesty, and has been commissioned to return to France and put himself in relation with the French journals. It is added that a new journal is to be established in Naples, under the direction of this person, who was formerly a writer in the Buropa Arti,stca. It is greatly to be regretted that among the natives of Eo distinguished a country as France should be found the great defenders of this corrupt Government, but every medal has its obverse side, and it is a consolation to see a growing sense of the necessity of consulting public opinion. Those who were at first incredulous of the report now lend some faith to it-that an attempt was actually made on the life of the King; that a shot was fired, which just grazed his shoulder; and that the soldier who fired then shot himself. The police, I am informed, are making arrests among those who speak of the circumstance, there being an impression that a sect exists for the purpose of destroying the King's life. The general feeling o: the country is, however, I am persuaded, healthy, and the great body of the Neapolitans are bent on pursuing legitimate objects by legitimate means. Their moderation is not the less because of their resolution, nor their resolution the less because of their moderation. I always question the suspicions of the police, as they thrive on false reports and the fears which they inspire. I do not know whether I may venture to allude to a statement I have just heard, that the Royal carriages and the fonrgon belonging to the King, and which have been lying at Portici ever since th: last Royal journey, have been lately removed. The statement continues that at the post-house orders had been given to keep 36 horses iu readiness for a given time. The conjecture is that the Queen is going to Vienna, and perhaps the King. A French war steamercame in yesterday morning. The Five per Cents. were done at 111J; Exchange on London, 550. The Piedmontese Gazette publishes the law authorizing the Sardinian Government to concede the railway line from Arona to Domodossola and the branch from Thonon to Geneva to a private company, composed of MM:. James Fazy, Achille Morisseau, Counts de La Valette and de Bourmont, and others. The Chamber of Deputies at Turin, in its sitting of the 29th ult., voted the bil for piercing a tunnel through Mount Cenis by a majorlty of 98 to 28.

- TURK9Y. [The following appeared in our second edition of yes. terdav '.-I (PROM OUR OWN?CO_ POET.) The Sultan has at last undertaken his long talked of tour in the Sea of Marnmora. Every one thought that he bad given up the idea, or at any rate deferred it until rhe festivities of the circumcision were over, when, all of a sudden, on Saturday last at noon the Grand Vizier received a notice that on Sunday (that is, yesterday), at 1p.m., BisMajestywouldstart,and wished the Grand Vizier and his two brothers-in-law (Ahmed Fethi, Director-General of the Ordnance, and Mebmed Ali, the Capudan Pasha) to accompany him. This trip of the Sultan, ordered and counterordered as it was, is, like every other movemaent in the palace, brought into connexion with changes in the Government, and speculation is so much the more busy as on one occasion a change of air for the health of the Sultan was followed by a change in the MIinistry. Strange things are these changes. Since the beginning of the Ottoman history there never has been a reign during which so many changes have taken place as under the present. In 18 years as many as 17 different Governments have been formed, which gives almost one for every year-nay,if we calculate that Redschid Pasha has been twice in powerfor several years,weshallfind that there are almost two for each of the remaining years. This is so much the more curious as t-'hese frequent changes fall just at an epoch when Turkey is supposed to have abandoned the old system of favouritism under which the Sultan's whims were law, and to have established fixed rules according to which the government of the empire is to be carried on. The explanation of this apparent contradiction seems to lie in the difference between the form and the spirit of a Government. Anciently, perhaps, the forms were not so well defined as now, but the same spirit pervaded not only the reign of one, but often of a succession of Sovereigns, while now everything gets more and more shut in by a circle of lifeless forms, in which it would be vain to seek for any other spirit than that of intrigue. Thus we see from the beginning of the dynasty of Osman up to the time of Sultan Suleyman the Great, or about 300 years, during which a family of shepherd chieftains became the Sovereigns of a mighty empire, all the Grand Viziers almost invariably chosen from four families, who often transmitted this dignity from father to son? and carried out systematically that mighty policy to whioh the empire owes its grandeur. Sure of their position, they devoted their whole thoughts and energiestotheState, and,identifying themselves with its weal and woe, tbey endeavoured to erect a structure which has lasted for centuries. How different it Is now! A Grand Vizier is scarcely installed in his place when he can already trace a thread of intrigues which is sure ultimately to pull him down from his place. The greater part of his energy he is obliged to waste in keeping in his position. Woe to him if he forgets for one moment his precarious position in order to devote all his thoughts and strength to the welfare of the State I He will soon perceive that he has lost ground which he can never recover. How can he build for the future if he is not sure that the very moment he lays down the basis of a new reform another will not step in and spoil the whole? He must become like a political ousier, who lives from hand to mouth, careless of the future, because he can have no control over it. Ile must often sacrifice the best measures in order to carry others; he has to yield against his better convictions, and yet bear the whole responsibility of a failure. When Redschid Pasha becamne Grand Vizier the whole State machinery was at a standstil, and several of the pending questions seemed involved in hopeless confusion. His diplomatic skiU contributed greatly to the solution of the Bolgrad question; the question of the Principalities soon assumed a brighter aspect through his management. The whole number of industrial schemes which had been lying at the Porte for months were decided, and the project of a thorough administrative and judicial reform in the provinces was discussed, and obtained the Sultan's sanction. The revenue was considerably increased by putting a stop to the abuses in the farming of the Customs, and various other improvements of a less prominent character were made; and duringaU this time he hadto look about in a continual dread, for no man has more secret enemies. Habitual ingratitude is one of the prominent features of Turkish dignitaries, and most of the men who are so active against the Grand Vizier have been brought forward and raised by him to their respeetive positions. tier Majesty's ship AIedina, Captain T. Spratt, left this on Wednesday last for the Danube, where she will be of the greatest service to the Commis,ion on the Danube Navigation. The Medina was up in those parts last year, and all the thlee branches of the river have been minutely surveyed and sounded by Lieutenant Wilkinson, under the superintendence of Captain Spratt, who has drawn up a report on the subject. I shall have to speak of this report at some other time. I wish only to remark here that these are the first reliable surveys ever made of that country, and that they will, together with the practical suggestions of Captain Spratt, considerably facilitate the work of the Commission. On her way from Malta to this place the Medina has made soundings between the former island and Candia,which have givensomevery interesting results. The bottom between the two islands appears to be one large valley or basin, with very steep sides, so that at 30 or 40 miles from the shores the depth rapidly increasesoverl,O00fathoms, showing at the deepest point explored as much as 2,000 and odd fathoms. By an ingenious contrivance Captain Spratt has succeeded in getting up a considerable quantity of perfectly dry and hard yellowish soil from that depth, the examination of which vrill throweonsiderabe light on the formation of the wrhole basin of the Mediterranean. According to an announcement of the Messageries Imperiales, the direct boats of that company will leave this from the 1st of July on Wednesdays instead of Mondays.

SAILING OF LADY FRANKLIN'S ESPED11iON.- The Fox screw steamer, fitted out at Aberdeen by Lady Franklin, sailed from that port on Wednesday morning in search of the remains of Sir John Franklin and his crew. The vessel has been supplied with every article of equipment which could possiblv be desired, and many and valaable have been the gifts that have been presented to aid in tbo department of provisions There was a large concourse of spectators present when the Fox left the docks, who cheered Captain W'Olintock aDd his gallant crew lustily as they passed along. Lady Franklin and her niece, Sophia, were present. and it was a rather remarkable coincidence, that as the Fox got under weigh the Lady Franklin brig and Sophila. which were both purchased for the Arctic search, ander Captain Penny several years ago, should just have left the harbour under the cbarge of the same Captain Penny, to pursue the whale fishing dnring theautumn, and, wvitering m Cuniberland Straits, resume the fishing agan in spring. The Fox steamed away to the north, and is expected to make theice in a week or I0 days.

THE UNITED STATES. (PRtom ou1t OWN CoRtitspo-NDENT.) NEW YORPK, JiTm' 20. Before my last letter had left the port of Bostoneven while the train that carried it hence was passing up the island of Manhattan, to cross to the mainland-the city of New York was on the verge of bloodshed and anarchy. A false step then might have plunged us into a sea of trouble. At the risk of repeating some things that l have said in former letters, I will briely reeapitulate the causes that led to the collision, fortunately almost bloodless, before giving an account of the doings of the week. At the Presidential election *he city and county of New York and the neighbouring river counties were, as perhaps you will remember, Democratie by large majorities. In the city alone the majority against Ailr. Fremont was over 45,000. Notwithstanding this apparently overwhelming vote, the sentiment of the intelior was so unanimous that he received the vote of the State of New York by a majority larger than the adverse majority in the river counties. There was great complaint at the time that the poliee force of the metropolis was illegaly used to influence votes. It was under the control of the Mayor and the city Judge, both of whom were ardent Democrats; and, whether justly or unjustly, it was said by the Republicans that improper influences were brought to bear upon it, and that the Democratic vote of the city was fraudulently increased by ten or twelve tbousand votes. The Legislature, being chiefly returned from the interior, was largely Republican. When it met it received from persons connected with the city administration a representation of the inefficiency of the existing charter, by which the various bureaus were made independent of the mayor. Complaints were also made of the inefficiency of the police. TheLegislature took the matter in hand and enacted two laws; one a new charter for the city to come into operation on the 1st of Mav; the other reorganizing the police department, and extending its jurisdiction to the neighbouring counties under commissioners to be appointed by the Governors. The constitutionality of the latter law was questioned, principally on the ground that it removed the election of the commissioners from the people to the executive. The real cause of dissatisfaction lay behind-that it transferred the power from the Democrats to the Republicans. In selecting the commissionerstheGovernorunwisely disregardedthe views of the adverse party, and nominated persons who were not only his own political friends, but who had made themselves particularly obnoxious to their opponents by their partisan zeal. When these commissioners entered upon their duties they were met by a refusal to surrender the archives, force, and station-houses. They procured rooms elsewhere, and began to organize a force of their own, which up to Tuesday lastnumbered about 300 men, while the old bodv, under charge of the Mayor, numbered nearly 900. After preliminary legal skirmishing the two parties joined issue on a quo warranto, a hearing was had before the Supreme Court, and the law was sustained. The Mayor took an appeal to the Court of Appeals, the tribunal of last resort. The statute provides that after the Supreme Court sustains the constitutionality of a law all acts done under it shall be valid, even though the decision be subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals. Notwithstanding this the Mayor refused to yield. The case went to Albany, and has been quietly heard there this very week, while the streets of New York have been filled with fears of bloodshed. Serious as such a collision must appear to European eyes, it would have terminated without other trouble than temporary anarchy if the important office of Street Commissioner had not become vacant at this time by the death of its incumbent. Owing to the check of parties each upon the other, this department has been a nullity for two or three months. The accumulations in the streets have become so offensive as to threaten pestilence, and to call out vigorous remonstrances from all quarters. it is certain that there must be a great deal of money spent at once if the health of the city is to be preserved. This brings with it a corresponding patronage, and control of votes in the autumn. Rence the political importance of the place. The Mayor claimed the right of maling the appointment under the new charter. The deputv of the deceased incumbent claimed the right to hold over until the autumn elections, under the old charter. The Governor prudently took counsel of the most distinguished Democratic barrister of the State, and was advised that the sole right of appointment lay in him, and that he would fail in duty should he neglect to exercise it. Fortified thus by the opinion of a political opponent, he filled the vacancy. The Mayor, to protect the records of the office until he could make an appointment himself, procured an execution to be issued on a petty unsatisfied judgment against the city, and to boe levied on the city furniture in that office. The Governor's appointee presenting himself, found the sberiff in possession. He demanded the property; the deputy refused to deliver it up. After more or less coquetting, the new appointee was forcibly ejected by the Mayor's police, with a coat rather the worse for the struggle and other marks of the squabble. This brief sketch brings the contest up to the date of my last letter. The ejection of 1Ir. Conover was the signal for more stirring work. He first instituted civil process agaiust the Mayor for assault, and battery, and sued out a writ for his arrest which the laws of New York permit. This was put into the hands of the coroner for service, anda warrant on a criminal process for the same offence was put into the hands of one of the new police. The Mayor, warned by these proceedings, began to call in his forces to garriton the public offices. The City-hall of New York, where are the courts of law and the public offices, is a mass of straggling buildings, situated in what is caUed the Park, almost at the lowest point of the island. In former days the road to Boston and the road to Albany, forked at what was then the head of Broadway, opposite where the Astor-house now is. The irregular piece of land of about a dozen acres, included in the fork was common pasture ground for the inhabitants. As population crept up to its vicinity, it was laid out as a public ground, amd a pretentious white marble City-hall was erected with accommodations supposed to be ample for aU time. Population, however, shot by it, Broadway extended itself miles up the island, the Albany-road became the Bowery, and now the whole space belowv the Park is occupied by business w arehouses only. The City-hall was long ago found too small for public uses, and smaller buildings have been from time to time erected in the rear of it, as wanted. The whole is knoBn by the name of the City-halL The Mayor attempted to garrison but two of these buildings-the City-hall proper, in wbich was his own office, and the Iall of Records, in which was the office of the Street Commissioner. His force camae up from all the police stations. The rest of the town was left unprotected while his men marched up in squads with staves in their hands to garrison the offices and protect him from arrest. TVhe coroner, going to the City-hall to execute his precept, was driven out of it by the Mayor's police. The officer who undertook to serve the criminal precept fared no better. He was told that he would not be recognized as a police officer. A requisition was made upon the metropolitan police for a force Euflicient to execute the precept. Fifty men were detailed for this service. They marched to the Cityball through an excited crowd, composed mostly of Irish supporters of the Mayor. The building in which the Mayor's offlce is situated was by this time occupied byseveral hundred of the municipal police, armed with staves. The mob outside, numbering many more, were also armed with sticks and clubs. A more foolish effort was never made; it can only be justified by the supposition that no serious resistance was expected. The metropolitan squad attempted to enter the building, were surrounded by the municipal force on the steps, were beaten back into a hostile mob, who reeoived them with execralions and blows, and were forced to retire with about 20 of their men Irors de combat, two of them, probably, mortally wounded. This was on the 16th of June. On the 17th the | anniversary of the Battle of Bunker's-hill was to ba I celebrated at Boston with unusual 9clat. Tho Governor of this State was to be present, and the favourite Regiment of lNew York Militia was on its way to the steamer to take part in that celebration. 'When I speak of mfilitia or nilitia officers you must not regard such a force from an European point of view. It is essentially a civil foreo under a military uniform. The commander of this division, General Sanford, who will figure in this accunt, is a banrister, who combines skill before juries with a love of military exercises and tact in the management of difficulties like these. He has under his c.mmand in the city of New York Eeveral thousand men, who do dutyas citizen soldiers aolely from the love of it. They are orgaized into regiments more according to their asociations than by nny fixed rule. Thus, the Germans finmdiem. selves together, the Irish are clannish in this a in verrything else, and social considerations chiefly influence the combinations in the native regiments. In so large an organization there are of course plenty of Brook-green Volunteers and Jerome Patur6ts; but, as a whole, the troops are better organized and better drilled than any similar forces I have ever seen. The particular regiment of wrhich I speak is composed of young men of independent means, who spend in these amusements the extra strength which the Englishman uses up in .abootinz and hunting. A regiment composed of such material is not much surpassed in soldierlike bearing by any regular force. They were ordered from the steamer to aid in the execution of the law, and marched about 600 strong to the City-hall to enforce the arrest. Their appearance settled the question for that day. The arrest was made, and a writ of habeas corputs was issued by the citv Judge, on the ground that the aECts complained of vwere done by the defendant as Mayor. The work once done, the regiment was allowedto go on its way to Boston, to take part in the next day's ceremonies there, nine otber regiments meanwhile having been ordered to equip themnselves for duty. This brings thehistory downtotheeveningof Tuesday,thel6th. That evening Greneral Walker arrived, and was publicly received in the Park. The reception was lame enough, but had the weather been good the keeping together the masees who sympathized with him might have produced trouble. The heavens, however, which had been threatening rain all day, opened ian abundant shower, and extinguished enthusiasm for Walker and the Mayor at the same time. During the night I went to most of the places where I thought trouble was possible. The City-hall reminded one of Parig in a revolution. The iron gates of the principal opening were swung to and barred. Through the railings, by a dim light, a large police force was seen drawn up in column in the aisles with their staves in their hands. The other entrances were guarded with equal care. A small mob of fighting characters was hanging about the buildingtotake part inwhatever might turn up. The metropolitan police-office was much quieter. There were not a hundred people there. The detailed soldiers were smoking cigars and drinking beer in their guard-rooms. In the streets there was a great lack of policemen, but plenty of soldiers with muskets on their shoulders hurrying to their respective stations. Business moved onin its ordinary course, except that the streets were a little more crowded than usual ona rainy night. The 17th was the day appointed for hearing the habeas corpus. The judge, to allay excitement, adjourned his court to the Mayor's-office. The Cityhall by this time was fully garrisoned. TheMayor had lost no time in swearing in special policemep, and I must say that a more unequivocal set of ruffians than he had about him never was seen. I am Eorry for the credit of N'ew York that it could produce on so short a notice such a set of cutthroat faces. The commissioners were also busy receiving and swearing in volunteers on their side. New warrants had been issued for the Mayor's arrest, and it was understood that he would resist their execution by the metropolitan police. A bloody collision in the course of the day seemed probable. The City-hall by this time was surrounded by many thousand persons, a majority, like myself, spectatorg of ihedrama, but manyfeverishly excited on behalf of the Mayor. Policemen were drawn up in all the corridors of the building, or were hanging out of the windows, smokingcigars andlookinglazilyupon the scene below. Every entrance was guarded by a strong patrol that kept the crowd at bay, and admitted to the building only known friends to the Mayor. The all of Records wvas guarded in the same way. From time to time squads of 20 or 30 men were sterbusly marched from one building to the other, and the curious crowd vibrated with the motion. The mob seemed ready to explode on the first indiscreet touch. The commissioners asked General Sanford to call out the militia to enforce the execution of the warrants. The General expressed his willingness to aid in the execution of the laws, but thought it inwise to comply with the request, as the call would probably result in bloodshed. The commissioners telegraphed to theGovernor to come back from Boston with the regiment that had gone on there. General Sanford, who throughout behaved with excellent judgment, walked to the Mayor's-office and told his honour that these warrants must be executed. The Mayor replied that he did not recognize the metropolitan organization. The General answered that heshould sustain that police with the whole force at his command. The Mayor yielded, and the warrants were served. Peace was thus restored. The excitement continued all the folowing day. Groups of men gathered about the streets discussing the municipal rebelion, but, fortunately, night came with a heavy rain that lasted throughout yesterday, and washed the disorder away. The Iayor was released on the habeas corpus. Since then he has been arrested at the suit of the injured policemen, and has also been ordered by the Superior Court to show cause why he should not be committed for contempt in resisting its process. The great length of the story of the rebellion leaves no room for general news, of which there is really nothing that you will not get in the summary from your I.iverpool correspondent. I cannot entirely pass by an imitation in a small way of the Mayor's rebellion, which I fancy will make some talk in Paris. Parot, one of the French prisoners who has been so long detained here, was brought before the commissioner at his office. Returning to prison, in company with his counsel and the deputy in whose custody he was, the attorneys suddenly seized the Sheriff, each holding anarm, and toldthe prisoner to run, which he did so effectually that he has not since been heard of. The financial news is unimportant. The defalcations in the Ohio State Treasury turn out to be larger than was supposed. They will not interfere with the payment of the July interest in New York.

MOEY--MABKET and CITYINTELLIN(ENCE. Thtursday Evening. The Bank of E:ngland to-day made no reduction k their rate of discount. The Oourt sit a considorable time, and the expectation becomne genieral that an alteration of at least a-half pter cent. would be announced. There "as consequeutly soime disappointment. The stock of buloil on.nd tile reserve ow: notes ae now very miich beyouid the an,ounits at 'whiih they stcod in 185i, a lhen the rateo -a8 5 per cent. Hence its maintelnance at I pa-i- cetit. above that point, while the quantity is daily increasing, and a cousiderable siUm iS due frmu- Akustlxahl, perplexe.s all who would endeavour to gutide theinselves by precedent. The g rowving anxiet3 about the si ate of afiairs in ludia may perhaps have operated to cause hesitation, but, as no fulrther accounts are etxpected till the 12th, it is not to be supposed that the izuereantile body will be content to reumain uid(tr pre-sure for another fortnight waiting for news, he etliect of which, whatever may be its complexion, nlust be altogether doubtful. The natural rate of money at this moment, supposing the Bank to let o' t their usual supply, would certainly uot be more than 5 or 5k per cent. ()f course, thlis condition of the market may at any time sudden ly change, but such changes can be mlet when they occur, and it cannot be considered the function of the Bank to speculate upon events that may never happen. The funds have shown a slight incerease of firtnness. Consols opened at the closiig quotations of last evening-92i to i, and, owing to the anticipation of a reduction in the rate of discount, went to 92- to 1. After the breaking up of the Bank Court they returned to their first price, buit in the afternoon better accounts came from the Paris Bourse, and there were again buyers at 92a. Bank Stock left off at 212k to 214; Reduced, 92A to ; New Three per Cents., 92i to -I; India I3onds, 10s. to 6s. discount ; Exchequer Bonds, 988 to J; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. discount to par. There was a general diminution in the demand for,money. In foreign securities the operations were limited, and comprised ouly Danish Five per Cents., 102i; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96k; Sardinian, 89j to ;* Spanish Deferred, 251 J; Turkish Sin per Cents., ')(; and 96i; ditto, F'our per Cents. Guaranteed, 102;- and Dutch Four per Cesits., 98. The Snal quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 45c. for money, and 67f. 40c. for the present account, showing a recovery of more than a-half per cent. Money is still stated to be very scarce on the Bourse, btit for commercial purposes there is a good supply. About 170,0001. of American gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The Stebonbeath is announced from Port Phillip -with 5,254 ounces of gold, valued at 21,0001. The Francis Henty, Roxburgh Castle, Champion of the Seas, and Tudor are now overdue, with an aggregate of 410,0001. The next telegraphic intelligence front India by theOverland Mail, vidTrieste, is not expected before the 12th or 13th at the earliest, although the vessels on the present occasion are fast ones. The Government, however, consider it probable that the authorities at Bombay, upon any great occurrence, would be likely to despatch a special steamer, in which case fresh accounts may arrive at any moment. It is understood that an amalgamation between the Royal West India Mail Company and the European and Australian Royal Mail Company has been agreed upon, subject to the approval of the shareholders. With reference to the late Canadian Railway disclosures, the secretary of the Great Western of Canada line desires to point out that mainly through the vigilance of the English directors that company was entirely preserved from the schemes in which it was sought to be entangled. The amount of silvcr to be despatched by the India and China mail of the 4th is nearly 800,0001. Includingthequantitylikelyto be added at Marseilles, the total will fall little short of 1,000,0001. The public have been recently astonished by the prevalence of the belief in witchcraft. In the commercial world, however, where all is thought to be plain hard sense, professors in alchymy are to be found at every corner, who not only boldly proclaim their faith, but are widely regarded as financial authorities of a high and impenetrable nature. To common people nothing can seem plainer than that an excess of expenditure over income cannot be kept up indefinitely, but must sooner or later produce bankruptcy. If a nation runs a career of luxury, and absorbs foreign products of all kinds without manufacturing a sufficient amount of goods such as foreigners will accept in exchange, they must, of course, part with their gold and silver, aud when aU this is exhausted trade must come to a stand. The entire doctrine of the foreign exchanges is here summed up, and but for the interminable pamphlets and speeches of the mystery-men, who will not leb a Vlain matter stand, the world would never have had an idea that there are any depths of finance to be sounded beyond the simple rule of keeping your outgoings within the limit of your in-comings. But the gentlemen in question, whose name is Legiop, have agreed upon a theory that this necessity, although it may apply to individuals, has no beariug on the mutual intercourse of nations, and that by the use of certain methods, with regard to whiclh they none of them coincide, each insistiag that he has a specific of his owvn, a nation may enjoy the power of purchasing the goods of foreigners to any extent. However great imay be the demand for money enough can constantly be created to meet it, so that, no matter what quantities may be sent abroad, the supply at home shall always be equable. If this is not attained it is the fault of Government, and at the door of Government all the great manufacturers and engineers and otlhers who now and then wind up and pay Is. or half-a-crowvn in the pound may lay the charge of thekr disasters. They had factories, plant, tools, wonderful patents, &c., but they wanted more money and couldn't get it, the article at the time being in very inconvenient i;emand. Of course, the disciples of such a theory are therefore numerous. Is was hoped, however, that light would at length be thrown in upon them. For the past 1.2 years no reckless insolvency has occurred in which the delinquent has not been encouraged to comfort hinself by abusing our vicious system. It was the ~Bank Charter Act, and not his owni imprudence, that lestroyed him. If there had been a proper supply lf currency, so that he could have got it upon his lls or notes, he could have gone ohl as well as any me. Doubtless, merely from himself all this wouild l ve passed for nothing, but the currency doctorsaany of them directors of banks and public writers -f note-said he was quite in the right and much o be pitied, and the public naturaUy thought here muist be something in it. Consequently the ely way to stop the mischief was to appoint a Paramentary Committee, anid invite all the leaders of 38 controversy to unfold the secrets that were to ive us perpetual wealth. It was known that aU moir processes differed, except that they had a )mnion foundation in paper; but this point of nion raises them far above the old alchymists, who quired expensive materialg-sosne nearily as costly },gold itself. The thing therefore was to. quiet eir wrangrlings, and, by giving them free spe-ech ,d fair play, to draw out the one iucontestable heme upon which they minght all agree. The 3tter would then be for ever set at rest. Either a trand potent system would be established, and ercial troubles would never more be known, *wO should quietly revert to our old ways, and ept the hard conclusion that we must never spend rs than we earn. Unhappily this hope proves Oa re. Beliefs such as these are not to be put gl by reason and publicity. The disciples of *icraft wvho lately stated their cases before some our awagistrates went away with their convicas uhaken. Itnowturns out that it will be )Sam0 with the Bank Charter question. Although cor 1ttee are understood to have had all the testf of the adepts before them, it appears they true magiciaTns have not been called, we ihall have these personages for ever assertthat the award is van,, and with the uni,l 4plause of the needy a'd improvident claing' that the whole affair must be re-argued. sdy a correspondent-evidently a person of tion, and probably a sound and intelligent man ter respects-writes to protest against his exi. I laid," he says, " before the committee, sgh one of its members, a plan which, among things, vwould prevent the currency from g unfavourably acted upon by the alterations > state of the foreign exchanges, but up present time I havb heard nothing from " S Probably this plan ia lying among nain of others, but it is to be re£d the committee will not sit in permnaato get through thm, The writer adds, " The opinion I find to exist among commercial men, whether in London or Liverpool or elsewhere, is that no one is likely to be heard who is not favourable to the present system." ConsideriDg that the committee includes Mr. Spooner, and that half of its number at least have distinguished themselves more or less by the avowal of crotchets against the present system, this complaint shows the business to be hopeless. Its author, indeed, seems after aU to have more faith in the impartiality of The Times than in that of the selected judges, and kindly offers to submit the particulars of the plan. But the season is oppressive, and it is is but right that the committee should still have the preterence. They have got their work before them, and, as a large proportion of the members helped to bring it upon themielves, they are bound to go through it without flinching.

HARROW SCHOOL. Yesterday was fixed for the annual commemoration, or "speech day," at Iarrow School. Speech days at our great national academies are always interesting occasions, not only to the parents and friends of the pupils (for that would be to tako but a narrow and non-catholic view of the question), but to all who feel interested (and who should not?) in the position attained and the progress effected by our public schools in these modern days of "fiery trial" for established systems and existing institutions. To the attraction of the annual festival at HarroNw, moreover, is superadded the pleasure of an excursion to one of the most remarkable and picturesque of our suburban villages, to say nothing of the peculiar fascination of the geniuis loci and the remiuiscences attaching to a spot where the genius of Byron was nursed into maturity, and where Peel, his "formfollow," whose future prowess the poet prophetically anticipated, laid the foundation of his fame. HarrowlSchool, under the able management and judicious system of Dr. Vaughan, still holds its ground against the encroachment of educational "reform," and the exhibition of yesterday is an incontrovertible evidence of the inextinguishable vitality inhorent in institutions essentially excellent and superior to the inroads of time, because they deserve to endure when time shall be no longer. The comparative inaccessibility of old "Harrow-on theHill" (for the North-Western Railway hardly facilitates the journey of visitors from the metropolis) did not prevent a large presence of spectators, or rather auditors, at the celebration of yesterday. The weather was propitious, and silk bonnets shone out defiant of thunder showers. The proceedings commenced at about a-quarter to 1 o'clock, when the Rev. Dr. Vaiighan, the respected Principal of Barrow School, entered the hall of audience at the head of his pupils. The company present included several distinguished guests, including the loet Rev. tho Archbishop of banterbury, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Oxford, the Bishop of Durham, the Very Rev. the Dean of Westminster and Mrs. Trench, Mtajor-General Sir W. Fenwick Williams K.C.B., Canon Wordsworth (an ex-master of Harrow School), the Rev. Dr. Jelf (of King's College, London), and others. The clergy assembled as if a meeting of Convocation had been convened at Harrow by the Queen's writ (as Parliaments formerly were at Oxford), and it is needless to add that a bevy of ladies such as England alone can produce graced the festival with their presence, and by their gay dresses greatly relieved the sombre hues of the predominant clerical costume.

The delivery of the speeches, which occupied about an hour and three quarters, was an entertainment reserved for those enthusiastic menbers of society who prefer to run the risk of being crushed to death to foregoing the chance of seeing a sight. For ourselves we are content, for the most part, to give our opinion on what the lawyers call " hearsay evidence,"-the only course open to tboseo who shrank from suffocation by asphyxia, or the nmore painful operation of the peinie for-Ic t cluec. The school-room was insufficient for the acconinodationof thevast concourse,andimanyofthevisibors remained outside, or amused their leisure by perambulating the pretty churchyard and sentimentalizing over the tombstone of the author of C1/irde Harold. As regards the speeches, it was generally admitted that Master Lockhart's recitation of Y'asso was admirable. The French scene was rendered with a very fair notion of the orthoepy of the laaguage, and the extract from the comedy of S/tc Stoops to Conquer excited the greatest mirth even among the grave and the orthodox. It will be seen that many ot the recitations were pieces emanating from the pupils themselves, aiid wholly untouched by the correcting pen of their masters. They are all fair specimens of schoolboy literature, but we must more especially commend the Latin hexameters of dlaster Trevelyan, and an English prize poemu, in heroic verse, composed by the same young gentleman (on the exile of Ovid), which was not recited. The other most renmarkable production was a short essay on " Novels," by Master Francis Storr, who enters into a generous and glowing defence of works of fiction. At the conclusion of the speeches a select portion of the company were invited to an elegant luncheon, or d,ljecrad la fourckette, laid out in the dining-room of Dr. Vaughan's private residence; and here, in the course of a symposium in which the most luxurious of the ancients might have ecstatically revelled, full opportunity was affordedfor the discussion-not only of the last German edition of the text of Sophoctes, but of such questions (. f minor mioment) as the superiority of strawberry-cream to the honey of Mount Hybla, or the comparative raciness of the " Falernian" of Horace and thesparkling vintages of the ChdateauClicquot. Dr. Vaughan, after luncheon, proposed " the healths" of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, as " visitors" of Harrow School, Dr. Tait responding in a speech highly conmplimentary to the head-master and very flattering to his pupils. The guests then adiourned to the garden, and there cussed the events of the day until their carriages arrived convey them to town.

This case, which occupied the Court the greater part of yesterday, was further continued this snorning. It was the petition of Mr. Hoblyn Samuel Peter, of N'o. 17, Hatfieldrow, Blackfriars-road, alleging that his uncle, Deeble Peter Hoblyn, now residing at Plymouth, is and has been for three years a lunatic and unfit to govern himself and to manage his affairs, and praying that one of the Masters in Lunacy might be directed to inquire whether he is a person of unsound mind, asid incapable of the management of him. self and his affirs. The medical evidence in support of the petition was that of Dr. J. W. Budd, of Plymouth, who had known Mr. Hoblyn for more than 10 years, and always considered him to have Bome radical defect of the nervous system, as evidenced by feeble intellect and constant irregular contractions of the voluntary muscles, such as occurs in chorea, or St. Vitus's dance. The witness attended him early in 1854, when he was found in bed covered with 16 blankets, and declaring that his doctors were in league with his servants to poison him, and that witness considered him of unsound mind, under the form "imbecihty." Mr. Whipple, surgeon, of Plymouth, swore that he considered Mr. Hoblyn of unsound mind, and utterly incapable of taking care either of his property or his person. Dr. Charles H.ingston, of Plymouth, deposed (by declaration) that in 1853 he constantly visited Mr. Hoblyn professionally, and his conduct was marked by so much eccentricity, absurdity, and want of judgment as to afford the clearest proofs of very defective mental power, and to convince witness that he was not qualified to take care of himself or his property. Lastly, Air. Joseph Square, surgeon, of the same place, attended dir. Hoblvn for the last three years, and was of opinion that his mind had. been so weakened by its original tendencies and subsequent disease as to be incapable of continuous thought and of forming a correct judgment on even the most ordinary affais of life, and that be is utterly incapable of managing his affairs or taking care either of his property or his person; hut witness did not see the necessity of his being at present placed under the restraint of confinement in an asylum or The medical evidence in opposition to the petition was that of Dr. Cookworthy, of llymouth, who visited Mr. Hoblyn on the 1st and 17th of May last for an hour on each day, and was of opinion that his intellectual powers, probably never very strong, might have been impaired by disease, and possibly inordinate indulgence in wino and women; that his memory would appear to be defective ; that he was vain and over-stated facts *that he was aware of the object of the doctor's visits and bore questioning, both minute and tedious, with great good humour and complacency, and his whole deportment was courteous and gentlemanly. He described the nature and extent of his property. Dr. C. R. Prance, of Plymouth, said that Mr. Joblyn's mental powers aDpeared never to have been great, but he showed no positive hallucinations or fancies of the realityofthingswhichdonotexist;answered9uestions,though his perceptions weroe not quick The affliction of chorea gave an appearance of silliness and impaired his utterance. These were the substantial parts of the affidavits both for and against the petition, so far as the medical witnesFes were concerned. From other evidence it appeared that rX. Hoblyn was entitled to alife estate in funded and in freehold property amounting to about2,000L.a-year, and in support of the petitionitwasswornthat he showed great and senseless aversion towards his niece and her husband, the Rev. a. Hosken* that he believed all persons about him wished to poison sim or do him personal- violence of a peculiar nature; and that he could not manage his ordinary affairs, and one servant swore that Mr. Hoblynononeoccasion gave a beggar 41. in gold. On the other hand, bank managers, butchers, bakers, poultry dealers, country gentlemen, and others swore to his habits beimg those of a gentleman and of a person of intelligence in dealings and money transactions. It appeared that up to 1854 Mr. C. L. Radcliffe, of Plymouth, had been M3r. oblyn's solictor, when he was discharged, and that he is now the solicitor of Mr. Hoblyn Samuel Peter, the petitioner. From one of the affidavits it appeared that this gentleman (the petitioner) was formerly an ensign in the 81st Regiment, and sold his commission in or about 1852, when he became a prompter and dresser at various theatres in London, Worcester, and Norwich, afterwards was in a union workhouse, and then became a dock labourer in St. Katherine's Docks, and is now out of employ and has no property but the clothes he has on. Mr. SELWNh and Mr. HuThPHREY, in support of the petition, urged the Court to afford its protection to the alleged lunatic by directing inquiry before a jury, and contended that even the medical evidence filed in opposition was enough to ground the inquiry, since no one of the witnesses ventured to swear that he believed Mr. Hoblyn to be in a sound state of mind. It was a very remarkable fact in the case, sworn to on behalf of the petitioner, and not denied, that Mr. Hoblvn had been brought to London, kept here for a fortnight, and examined by medical men of the motropolis in the presence of a barrister, and yet none of these medical men had made an affidavit in opposition, swearing that Mr. Hoblyn was of sound mind. The ATro nEY-GEs.mAL, Mr. CAIRsNS, and Mr. AarPEXLTT, for Mr. Hoblyn, observed that the only care the Court would have would be for the benefit of the alleged lunatic, and if they saw that he was in a situation where he was safe and comfortable it would not disturb him or distress him with an appearance before a jury. This gentleman had thought fit to give up his own house at Colquite, near Bodmin, and go to reside with the Rev. Courteney Bulteel, where he was both happy and safe from annoyance. Ihs anger against the Rev. Mr. Hosken was excited by that gentleman taking the bottom of his table against his express remonstrance, and, tbough it nmust be admitted that his anger was easily provoked, and when raised was unreasonable, yet that was no evidence of lunacy. It was not pretended by Mfr. Hoblyn or his friends that he was a man of vigorous intellect, but it was insisted that he was quite capable of performing the ordinary duties of life. He bought and paid for articles and took proper change, and required to be served at the 9rdinary mnarket price of goods and provisions; he had served the office of High Sherisff of Cornwall, and, as sworn by gentlemen of station, he conducted himself like one of themselves. It was also contended that the object of the petition was not for Mr. Hoblyn's benefit, but a retaliation upon him for the discharge of Mr. Radcliffe, who had sought out the dockla. bourer as a petitioner, and the petition ought to be dismissed. If the Court required a medical examination of Mfr. Hoblyn, that gentleman would willingly submit, or would submit to any other courEo their lordships saw fit. There did not appear to be any explanation of the visit to London or the examination alleged to have taken place there. It was plain that Mr. Boblvn was in the same state now as he had been for the last ten years, and during that period the solicitor who now presented a petition, or rather acted for the petitioner, had permitted him to do all acts, however responsible, that it was needful for a gentleman of property to perform, and yet now that the solicitor was discharged he found that Mr. Hoblyn was of unsound mind. Mr. SELrs.N was heard in reply, observing that the real question was whether the Court would protect the alleged lunatic, and not whether the petition had been presented from disappointed views, untrue as was such an assertion, for the whole family of Mr. Hoblyn concurred in its being brought before the Court. The case made in opposition was one solely depending upon the effect the attacks made upon professional men would have upon the Court. Lord Justice 1KNuIGnT BBRUCE said that the evidence in the matter was of such a nature as to the state of mind of Mr. Hoblyn that had the Court thought a commiEsion necessary, or likely to be materially useful for his protection or that of his property, or for his benefit, it would have had the case investigated before a jury. His Lordship was not, however, convinced that to issue a commission would be for his benefit, or in respect to his person or property importantly beneficial to him. Theoinquiry, therefore, which he would presently mention had suggested itself to the minds of both their Lordships as proper to be directed, and which when made might lead to a different conclusion. The question before the Court was whether it was essential to the protection of the person or the roperty of the alleged lunatic that inquiry should De directed. The questions of the motive of presenting he petition, it material, were very far indeed from essential. If such matters of consideration were material his Lordship would enter more fully into them, bat he was satisfied that the case must depend upon the evi4ence itself. Considering, therefore, the circumstances by which Mr. Hoblyn was surrounded; considering that on some parts of the evidence it was clear what his idiosyncrasy appeared to be; considering the state of his property, of which the bulk, the material bulk, was settled, rendering it, if not impossible, at least in the highest degree improbable, that any one would attempt to obtain from him a will, orother instrnment, materially prejudicial to himnd it was far from his Lordship's expectation that anyone nad sucnmtention-considering all these circumetances, the intention of the Court was to defer acting on the present petition beyond what his Lorsship would sav. This Court wished that a medical gentleman, if possible of the neigh. bourhood where Mr. Roblyn was residing, should see him and oblige their Lordships by reporting on his state of mind, not only scientifically, bu.t generaUy, and upon the nature of the establishment where he resided, the style in which he was living, and generaUy on his state and circumstances. Teir Lordships thought Dr. Becknall, of Exeter, if convenient to him despatch as his avocations would allow and the nature of the subject would permit. MIr. Bulteel and his medi. cal advser, Mr. I^ngworthy, would also be so good as to ake reports separatelyextending to the same subjects, and when this was done their Lordships would consider whether it was their duty tocall for any further evidence, ad would determine what was to he doue. Lord Justice TURNzn observed that be had very little to add. He considered that it would be premature and wrong to comment on the evidence as to the sanity or insanity. o Mr. Hoblyn. There was enough, however, for an inquiry. The principles guiding the Court in directing the powers of thoEe who have the authority over and custody of lunatics were first to see whether it were for the benefit of the lunatic to allow a commission to issue. It was ilmtposiible not to see, and Efeing not to regret, that the struggle in this case origi. natedbetween solicitorsto havethemanagement ofthe lunatic and his property. The Court was not inclined to look to one side or the other, but solely to tho benefit of the lunatic. Those who are called upon to act are to consider the expectation of the recovery of the lunatio, and to take care that if he be a man of large property the excess of income should come safe to his hands when the cause for the issue of the commission should have ceased. In the present case such consideration did not ailse, because the alleged lunatic was only owner of a life interest, nor had the Court to deal with the case of a man with a family, since Mr. Hoblyn was not married. The real question at present for the Court was to consider whether Mr. Hoblyn was for the present in a stateof comfort and happiness in the residence of Mr. Bulteel, and, if 60, the Court is not to expose bim to the irnstation and his property to the expense of. a commission. The Judgment to be pronounced on the petition would depend upon the reports, and the petition would istand over sn the meantime.
VIlF-CEOE"ELLORS' COURTS, JULY 2. - .--- -- WkIfITHG V. SLATER. izeJore YtCeUna?ceZUor Sir R. T. KTD "1urn w`e mness lar rnlo PurDose of setting aside a deed dated the 18th of January, 1855, as voide againast creditors. The case occupied the whole day, and is not concluded. Mr. Glasse nd M1r. Mller appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Swanston, Mfr. Baily, AEC Karsiake, and Ili. De Gem for the defendants. (Before Vice-hanceeor Sir J. STUART.) smEsorTToa v. xnstNs. This case came before tho Court Upon exceptions by the plaintiff to the answer of the frst defendant, Adkdns, for insuffilcienoy. The suit was instituted for the purpose of obtaining the delivery up by the defendant to the plaintiff of several bills of exchange and promissory notes, I 0 U's, and checks, bond and warrants of attorney, and other securties; for an irnunction to restrain the defendants from negotiating, or assigning, or taking any pro. ceedings at law in respect of the same; and for an account of moneys received by Adkins in relation to the matters mentioned in the bill, and for payment by him of the balance which might be found due to the plaintiff on taking such account. The bill alleged that in 1846 the plaintiff became acquainted with the defendant Adkins, who kept a gambling house in Albemarlestreet; that the plaintiff there met asd became acquainted with the other defendants; that on several occasion between. that year and the year 1853 the plaintiff lost large sums of money at play, and that in order to enable him to play Adkins pretended to advance money to himu by means of counters intended to represent the money so pretended to be lent to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff gave bills of excbange and several I 0 Us, checks, bonds, warrants of attorney, and other securities to Adkins for the money so pretended to be lent, to the amount of 10,4251, and that the plaintiff had paid to Adkins a large amount in respect of principal and interest represented by the latter to be secured y the bllls of exchange and other securities before named. ThedefendantsotherthanAdkinsallege that someof the Eecuritieswhich arethe subjectof the present suit came into their possession for valuable consideration. The defendant Adkins pleaded the Statute of IAimiitations as to part of the subject-matter of the snit, and put in an answer to some of the interrogatories to the bill, but declined to arawer others of those interrogrtories, on the ground that by doing so he would subject himself to criminal prosecution, and to punishment or penaltiea. Mr. Bazalgette appeared for the plaintiff in support of the exceptions, and Mr. Speed for the defendant Adhins. The VIc.-CnACsELLoP. said there was no doubt about the rule that a defendant wasnot compellable to answer a question. that might subject him to a criminal prosecution. The difficulty was as to the application of the rule, which was one of publc policy, andwhich had come under the consideraw tion of the Court, and had perplexed it at various times. IX the case of " Sloman v. Kell" (4, Y. and C., Exch., 169), the defendant insisted, with reference to the penalties of the statute, the 9th of Anne, cap. 14, that he was not bound to answerwhether money for which certain securities were alleged to have been given was lent at play. But Lord Abinger held thatthe forfeitureof tbesecuritiesunder the statate of Anne was not a reason why the defendant should be allowed to protect himself by not answering. AA good deal of surprise had been excited in his (the iceChancellor's) mind by words attributed in a recent case of " Fisher v. jonalds' to the late Lord Chief Justice Jervis and Mr. Justice Maule, to the effect that it was enough for the person interrogated to state upon bis oath that he considored, or had been advised, or that it was his opinion, that his answering the question would tend to criminate him, and that the witness was the sole judge upon the subject. That certainly did not accord with other authorities. There might be cases in which a witnes. should be allowed to be the sole judge; but to lay it down, as had been done in the argument, that where a man said thatin his opinion, or that he was advised, that if he should answer the question it would subject him to a criminal prosecution it was enough was Stating the proposition far beyond what could be considered as an inflexible rule of this Court; and Mr. Best, in bis book on evidence, said it was impossible to say that a 'witness was the sole judge, bat that the Court must determine according to the circumstances of the case whether the statement of the witness was to be conclusive on the subject. In the present case there was not raucla difficulty in dealing with the question. The defendant had pleaded to the bill, and had answered some of the interrogatories, but he declined to answer the other matters in the bill, on the ground that his doing so would subject him to a criminal rosecution. The interrogatory to which the defendant Adjected to answer was whether he did not induce the plaintiff to pay to him, and whether he did not obtain and receive from theplaintiff large, and what, sums of money without any legal consideration, or for some consideration which was invalid or had failed. It seemed a great deal too much to say that a defendant could protect himself from answering that interrogatory. What punishment wvould he expose himself to by answering it ? It was said that the8thand 9th of Victoria, cap. 109, sec. 17, provided that cheating at play was to be punished as obtaining money on false pretences; but that enactment did not ap to have any application to the present case; aut if it had this defendant must answer more than he had done. He might under the 38thL order of 1841 answer until he came to the point of danger, and then state that to answer further would subject him to a criminal prosecution. Here the defendant cho0e vaIuelY and generally to state, upon his oath, tbat his lblity to prosecution was a reason for not answering questions which did not appear to be links in a chain of criminal prosecution. The defendantwas bound to answer more fully than he had done, and the exceptions most be allowed, with costs. (Beforc Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) JAIROLD V. IOULSTON. The arguments upon this notion were resumed. The plaintiffs, as bas been already stated, were the proprietors of the copyright in A Guide to thc Scientitic Kaowledgc of Things Familiar, compiled by Dr. Brewer, and sought to restrain the defendants from publishing The Reason Whys on the ground of its being Mn a great nmeasure copied, or taken, or imitated with merely colourable variations, from Dr. Brewer's work, which has already reached its 11th edition. The object of the plaintiffs' work was thus stated in its preface:- " We know that a flutO Produces a Amuical eeu:d Pound a .d a e tell adiEoordant one; thatefireiE h:t. ice cold a a a cand'e luminousthat water bois when subjected to beat and fr E7,b from cold; bn; when a chUd looks uP into our face atd asks u s v b, how many times is it filencedvith a frowiD, or called foolish forasking Fuch silly questions ?

The author of The Reason Why had proposed to himself a similar task, which he had accomplisbed in 1,207 questions. The plaintiffs? case was, that an unfair and rervile use bad been made of their work by the defendants, ard that this was shown by various coincidences in the orcer and arrangement of tha questions and their language and the form of the answers, which could not have occurred witheut copying or imitation, regard being had to the scope and extent of the subjects treated. The defendants' case was that no portion of the plaintiffs' work had been pirated or unfairly sed, and theyreferred to various earlier Vworks, as GrMfiths's )hynsi.stry of the Four Seasons, Govwer's Phei,osicna of Domestic Life, Chambers's In.formntion fir the PopC4 Zhy anZd Bsecause, ac., as containing simjilar information expressed in similar terms to that contained in the work of Dr. Brewrer, The Court !was occupied for two days in listening to a minute and elaborate investigation by counsel of th-e various instances of alleged piracy, ranging over an infinite variety of subjects, from thecomparative merits of nietal or earthen. wareteapots to " vitreous" and "resins us" electiicity. Mr. molt and Mr. Karslake appeared in suppcrt of the mnotion; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Binde Palmer, on bhalf of the defendants, opposed the motion. The VICE-C}HANCELLOR, at the conclusion of the reply, said that he had no doubt that the defe, dants had copied, and to no inconsiderable extent, the wvurk of the plaintiffs, and it was much to be regretted that the defendants had not honestly avowed what portions had been so taken. At the same time it was a question of some difficnlty as to how far the injunction-would go, there being clearly a great amount of original and valuable matter in the defendantse work. He should therefore take time for consideratior before disposing of the case. SM}}IH V. TRE EAST RKET RAILWAY CO'IPANY. Mr. GInmARD moved for an injunLction to restrain the defendants from constructing their railway embankment and works upon the property of the plaintiff, near Sittingbourne, so as to approach nearer to his nill and premises than the centre line shown on the plans deposited. The plaintiff, who was owner of a paper-nuil near Sittingbourne, bad opposed the East Kent Railway Bill irt Parliament on tho ground that if the li:e were constructed as proposed his mlll would be rendered useless for the purposes of papermaking, from the smoke aial dust and otber nuisances resulting fror the ordinary trafflo of a ra31vay.

Vil"'Ags ac INY Prius, before Lor-d CAmpi uT and a sneriaz Jimi-uI aLs was an acrton Drought to recover damages for tho breach of a warranty that the defendant wa= aothorized to sell the plaintiff a house, No. 21, (Gloceseter-road, Pegent's l'ark, for the sum of 2,0501. The jury, not being able to agree upon theirverdict, were looked up for several hours yesterday, but towards midnight they came into court and iound their verdict for the defendant. Mr. M. CBJ5Res. Q.C., in the course of to-day applied to the Court to stay the execution for costs. Lord CAMPBFLL said he would not express any opinion as to the verdict, bxt ultimately his Lordship granted the application. DELF V. DEtAMOTrE AND OTHERS. Mr. E. Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Blaine appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. 1.L Smith and Mr. T. Jones for the defendauts. The p laintiff in this action, Thomas Delf, was a bookseUer and author, and he sued the defendants, Messrs. Delamotto and Cundell, photographic artists, and MeFsrs. Low and S,on, publishers, to recover damages for the infringesnent of his copyright in a work entitled The Practice of Photography. 'The work in question was written b the laintiff, but it was published with the name of " lhilip t. DelamotteN" as the author, with the view of promoting Mr. Delamotte's business as a photographic artist, which he had setup in connexion with Mr. Cundell, at No. 168, Reseseitt reet. The case came on for trial on Wednesday last, but, as the only question at issue was as to whether the copyright in the work was in the plaintiff or in the defendants, Dela. motte and Cundell, it was agreed that the question should be tried by Lord Campbell, without the intervention of a jury. The plaintiff caIled the following witnesses Thomas Delf, examined by W. BEAINE.-I was acquainted with MIr. CundeU prior to 1851. I was a bookseller's agent and bookseller, and also the author of several works. I wrote on bibliogrAphy and the fine arts. I had also paid attention to photography from its first discovery, both theoretically and practically. Prior to 1851 Mr. Cun. dell had beena bookseller and publisher, and he became a bankrupt about 1851. Ee then took premises at 168, Bondstreet, and carried on the business of a photographic artist. Before he took the premises he applied to me to vrite himi a popuila book on the subject of photography. He said that, ben hard up, he could not afford to give me more than 101. or it at present. I was to go to work on this. I resnonstrated, and said the remuneration was nothing. I had an establishment of my own at that time, but I looked for a full remuneration to the sale of the work and a share of the profits. I said I would undertake it on the condition of being further remunerated if the book sold. That conversation was about January, 1853. He was not then in partnership with any one. Nothing more was said at that te. I then proceeded to collect the requisite books to enable me to write the book, and expended nearly 201. in books and chymicals. I then prooeeded to prepare the manuscript. This is the manuscript. I gave it to Mr. Cundell for the printer. I drew up the titlepage with nmy own name as author. I was for three months almost entirely engaged in writing the work. It was an original work, entirely of my own cormposition. There are two pages which are in Mr. Cundell's own handwriting. From this mannscript the work was printed. Here are the proofs which I corrected. I made considerable alterationis. Before the book was published Mr. Cundell told me he had gone into partnersbip with Mr. Delamotte. I had prepared the titlepage with my name as the author. I showed it to Mr. Cundel], and he said, " I suppose it will make no difference to you if you allow Delamotte's name to apnear as the author; it will be a great advantage to him if you do." MIr. Delamotte was present on that occasion. I consented. I can scarcely remember to have seen Mr. Delamotte before that. I was led to understand that the first edition was 1,000. The title was The Practice of Photography * a s,anual for Sludents and Amateurs, by Philip H. Delasnotte, F.S.A., professor of drawing in King's College, London. It was published in July, 1853. In about May, 1854, lr. Cnndell informed me that that edition had been sold. 1 inquired if there was any profit. I was told there was none. He then asked me to revise the first edition. He said he could only afford to give ma, 51. I finaly agreed to accept the 51. for revising, and for my trouble with the second edition. It took a large portion of two months to revise. The revised edition was then pub. lisbed. It sold for 4s. 6d. I was given to understand that 1,000 copies were printed. The second edition was pub. lished by Low and Son, publishers, in about July, 1855. ByLord CAmPEwL.-lI got nothing out of the second edition but 5l. I saw an advertisement of a third edition. I gave no permission for the publication of a third edition. Mr. ijelasuotte told me he beleved it was printing, and he had received from CundeU 51. There was no longer any partnership between them. Mr. Cundell informed me he had sold the proof sheets to an American bookseller for 51. I then instructed Mr. Ilderton, my attorney, to stop the publieation of the third edition. I proceeded to make my entries at Stationers'-hall, to establish my rights. (The certificates from Stationers'-hall were then put in, dated the 29th of April and the 4th of December, 1856.) I then fileda bill in Chancery for an injunction. Cross-examined by Mr. SMITH.-The registration was after I knew of the third edition being advertised. When Mr. Cundell applied to me he did not ask me to write a book with bis and Mr. Delamotte's assistance. It was nob to be done under Mr. Cundell's superintendence as author, but only as publisher. It was not stated to use that he (Cundell) and Delamotte were to interfere with the writing of the book. Mr. Delamotte's namle was not mentioned. I first heard of his name when I showed the titlepage to Mfr. Cundell. That was, Ithink, in June; it was when the work was finished. I consented that his name should appear. I wrote every word of the preface to the first edition. It was signed "P. H. D.," and contains these words:-" One feature in this work, which I hope will be found useful, is the description of the various chymical subEtances usedinphoography, instead of being introduced in the space dlevobea to the details of manipulation, they are grouped together at the end; for these, and for the general revision of the work, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Thomas Delf, who undertook a task which the numerous demands upon my time forbade my fulfilling so carefuUy as the subject required." I was to receive 101. for writing the work and to share in any advantages which might result from its publication. I did not sell the copyright of the work. Nothing was determined upon as to what share I was to have of the profits, but I coucluded I was to have one-half. The author usually has half profits when the publsher is at the expense of the publication, I expected about 20' in books and chymicals. had:received 1001. from Mr. Cundell for a work which I wrote, of which he elaimed the copyright. Mr, Cundell lent me some pamphlets, but no chymicals. I only received 101. and 51. on account of that book. It is very lkely Mr. Cundell may have lIxnt me Si. I am not certain whether I paid it back. Mr. CundeU did not in August give mne a further sum of 81. for the trouble I had had ina that work. In page 20 of the manuscript there is a paragraph in Mr. Cundell's handwriting. Publishers somuetinmes do that (make additions) when they are competent. There is another in page 28, and others in pages 29 nnd 31, which are merely alterations of my writing. page 61 there is an addition by Mr. CundeUl. Mr. Cundeli did not compose the appendix. I was fully acquainted with the collodiosi process at that time. After the first edition I asked if there was any profit. I did not ask to see the accounts. Publishers' accounts are never worth seeig; they are always against the author, Laughter.) He offered me 51. to revise the second edition. We had received that suni from an American author. I do not know who supplied the photographic frontispiece. I had nothin to do with that. I knew the book was to be publshed with Mr. Delamotte's name as author. I did not ask for anything to show that I was the author. I did not think it was necessary, as I had the MS. in my own hands. Re-examined by Mr. HiLT-I borrowed some small sums of kr. Cmndell and gave him security for them. (The publication of the third edition in April, 1856, was This was thecase for the plaintiff. The defendants Cundell and Delamotte were then called, and gave their evidence as follows .- Mr. Cundell, examined by Mr. JoNEs.-I carry on business at 168, Regent-street, as photographer and publisher. In February, 1853, I entered into partnership with Mr. Delamotte. In that month I applied to Mr. Delf (the plaintiff) to write a book on the subject of photography. me agreed to do it, and I agreed to pay himl10. for doingit. At another time I agreed to give l,isu something more if the book was successful. I told the plaintiff I wished the book to bear'Delamotte's name. Probably that was in March, shortly before it was printed. Mr. Delamotte had great celebrity as a practical photographer, in making pictures. The plaintiff took a shop underneath the gallery at 168, Regent-street. I revised the work as it proceeded, and seat the proofs to the plaintiff. I supplied the list of chymicals. That is not avery important part of the work. On the 16th of April I paid him the sum of 51., and on the 4th of May a further sum of 51. OLnthe 31st of May I lent him 51. That had nothing to do with this work. Within a month I applied to him for repayment. He said the compUlation of the book had takei so much more time than he expected that he thought Iought to give himn that 51., and I consented. On the 15th of August, 18S3, I gave him 81. The work had been pgblihed, and was tolerably successfuil. Hfe asked mo to redeem my promise to give him something more on aeaountofitssuccess._I Ithen gave bis 8L by a check. I arserwzarels, about Midsummaler, 1854, told him that the first edition was out of print, and I vould be glad if he would revise the book. He asked me what I -would give hinm, to which I rephed 51. He did revise it, and the proofs were sene to him; and in August, 1854, he told me he had had a great deal more troable than he expected, and he should ,expect more than I had promnised hMm;. I thon gave him a check for 101. Nothing about the copyright was ever mentioned on the one sido or on the other. I believe I never saw the. titlepage. The profits of the first edition wero 51. 13s. 4d. The cost of the first edition was 1317. This secount ,of the expenses was muade out iu the last month. The plaintiff never said anything about a share of the profits. Cross-examined by Mr. HILL.-I took no security from the plaintiff for the suns I bave spoken of. Mr. Delamuotte, examined hr Air. SsITH.-I joined Mr. Cundell in the early part of 1853. hlr. C0ndefl, on beiDg recalled, said,-I lnever eDtered jibs bok.at ;tationers halL Mr. JArss mid thar was only necessary to enable the party to 4ning an attion. Mlr. SaUTa and Mr. HiLL then severaUysuymmed up their e94dence. and contended that their clients respectively wera entitxediotheverdict. Lrd CAmxBBLL said he would take the mauuseripts and otherdocuments home with him, and carefully exanine them before giving his decision. At the sitting of the Court this day (Thursday), Lord CutPBELL said the only question in this case was as to the copyright; for there could he to doubt that it had been infringed, if the property belonged to the plaintilf. YVitb. respect to the defendant. Delaluotte, his lordship ihought he had no title to the copyright, .though his nam appeared on the titlepage as authior. The plaintiff wras un- queaLaUIUny wrn 4U>uuIv uS le WOJrK, WfLiOi Was an original :sidvaluxble work on photography. His Lordship said he held in his hand the manuscript which the plaintiff bad written with his own hand, and which he had sent to the printers, and from which the work was printed. It certainly contained a few alterations and suggestions, but, hariag examined thewhole of them, he (Lord Campbell) was of opinion lhat they were of the most trifling importance, and not mora than any author might acceptfrom a&friend, withoat this at all interfering with his copyright. His Lordship said he could not say that this came within the 18th section of the Copyright Act (oth and 6th of Victoria, cap. 45). It was clear to him (Lord Campbell) that the manuscript was not iven to Cundell with a view to its becoming his property. r. Cundell merely asked the plaintiff to write a book on the subject of pbotography. His Lordship made some comments on the evidence, and concluded by saying that he saw nothing to prevent the plaintiff, who was the author of the work, from still having the copyright. On that issue, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. The infringement being admitted the plaintiff would have the verdict on that issue also. Mr. Hn.s, Q.C., said there would be a verdict for the plaintiff, with 40s. damages; and, the aotion being brought to try a right, his Lordship would give the necessary certifi. eates. Lord CAmPBELL Rssented. PRICE'S PATENT CANDLE COMPANY V. BAINVENS' PATEST CANDLE COMPANY. Sir P. Thesiger, Mr. Grove, Q.C., Mr. AL Smith, Q.C., Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Webster appeared for the plaintiffe; and Mr. E Hill, Q.C., Air. Hindmarch, and Mr. Mott for the defendants. This was an action brought by Price's Patent Candle Company against Bauwens' Patent Candle Company to recoverdamages forthe infringement of two patents, of which the plaintiffs were proprietors, and which were granted, the one to Jones and Wilson, in 1842, and the other to Gwynne and Wilson, in 1843, for various improvements in the treatment of fatty matters and the manufactixe of candles. The defendants denied the infringement, and also, in part, the novelty of the inventions. The whole of this day was occupied with the plaintiffi' case, and the defendants' opening. The trial was thern adjourned. We therefore defer our report. Busnss OF TrE COURT. The trial of the above cause having lasted the whole day, and it being likely that it would occupy the whole of tomorrow, Lord CAm.BrLL gave notice that no other cause would be taken to-morrow (Friday) in this court ; but that Mr. Justice Erle would sit and try a list of five causes. N3_ECOIND COURT. (Before Mfr. Justice EitxaF and a Comrnon Tury.) BENlETT V. BUDD AND OTrIuS. Mr. Tindal Atkinson was counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Hayes took notes for another counsel who was not present for the defendants. The action was brought for an assault and false imprison. 3nent. It appeared that the plaintiff was a lighterman, and occasionally did business for the defendants, who were copper merchants in Glamorganshire, having a place of business in London, where a person named Tims acted for them. InA ugust last Tims caused the plaintiff to be taken into custody on a charge of felony. He was taken before a magistrate, waS committed for trial, remained in prison five weeks and two days, was then tried and acquitted. The plaintiff proved this case. Mr. Justico ]iLEnE said he could not understand why the action was not brought against Tims. The issue was whether the defendants had caused the plaintiff's apprehension, and he had listened to the opening of Mr. Atkimon, and had seen what care he had taken to abstain from adverting to any evidence in support of the issue, so that he believed there was no such evidence. Mr. ATrQnSaN said Tims was in the service of the defendants, and he apprehended they would be liable for his acts. Mr. Justice oBnR-I observe, hlr. Atkinson, you smile when you say that. One of the defendants was called, who said he had not authorized the imprisonment of the plaintiff, and knew nothing of it until after it had taken place. The plaintiff was at once nonsuited. TREND V. SAIrrH. Upon this case being entered on the junier counsel begged his Lordship to wait five minutes until Mr. Serjeant Shea could come in. Mr. Justice Er .-I cannot do anything of the kind. I once gave evidence under a commission, and stated that it had been my habit to wait five minutes for counsel, and I was severely reprimanded by all the judges. Mr. Serjeant SEux (with whom was Mr. Row) at this moment came into court, and stated that this was an action for slander. The plaintiff and defendant were rival apethecarles, one at Eye, in Northamptonshire, and the other in a near neighbourhood. The effect of the words used was that the plaintiff was not a proper practitioner, and knew nothing of his profession. The learned Serjeant said thb defendant had stated these things to several ladies, to whom, of course, it was of great importance, as they regularly required the attendance of a medical man once a year. From the evidence of the plaintiff it appeared that he had been regularly educated, had walked the hospitals, passed the examinations, and had gained many prizes before he had been admitted. He commenced practice at Eye and Croland, and took the defendant into partnership, but they disagreed and separated. After this he found his practice fall off, and upon making inquiries he discovered that the defendant had said he was nob a qualilied medical man, and that he was liable to be sold uDp In cross-examination the plaintiff eaid the becoming a member of the College of Surgeons was more a matter of fee than anything else. Did not recollect putting the letters " X.R.C.S." to his name, and had not authorized those letters being added to his name in a prlnted paper. By the JUaDGE-Questions in surgery were put upon the examination by the Apothecaries' Company, and his reading had included surgery. Mr. JusticeERiy.-Then, that gives a right to practise in a country village as a general practitioner. Cross-examination continned.-Was an undergraduate of the London University. Had furnished his desaription to theLondon MedcalDirectory with the letters "M. R.C.S.," but he accompanied that information by a letter stating that he was not yet so, but intended to take ont his diploma before the end of the year. Labourers paid better than the rich. Had the word " surgeon" on his door. Proof was given of the defendant having said the plaintiffwas an impostor and a swindler, and not duly qualifed to act as a medical mani and he could stop him at any time if he thought pro,oor. aseveral persons had refused longer to employ the plaitbiff on account of what the defendant had stated; A farmer stated that he had employed the plaintiff and paid bim 201. at a time, but he did not employ him because the defendant had said he was not a doctor, hut he should call him in again if he found he was a doctor, as he was a better friend to the butcher than the doctor. Mr. Sn3nR, for the defence, urged that the case as regarded special damage, was most trumpery. It was to be lamented that the jury should be brought from their homes because a man had chosen to introduce himself as that which he was not. When a person spoke mnuch of his own qualificaton no great credit was to be given to him. Persons had no right to indulge in giving untrue accounts of themselves; it was a grievous wrong perpetrated upon society. The plaintiff was not a surgeon, and yet he had put "-surgeon upon his door. It was of imniortance that a man should be a man of truth. The plaintiff had been a candidate for the office of registrar of births, &c., and in his circular soliciting the appointment he had called himself a surgeon. This might be the age of false pretences, but the sooner the bubble burst the better. The real defence was that the defendant had made the representation upon information he had obtained. | The defendant stated that he had purchased a share of the plaintiff's business, and afterwards purchased a certain district of him, amounting in the whole to o001. He had asked for the plaintiffs testimonials, and the London Medical Dii-ectonj was shown to him. The plaintiff told him that his diploma as a surgeon was at his father's at Bridgewater. He at the time believed the Directory to be correct. Defendant had passed his examination as a surgeon. He had commuunicated with Surgeons'-half upon the qualification of the plaintiff. The defendant admnitted that be had stated that an eDceoution had been put in the plaintiff's house, but that he had paid the money, and the execution was withdrawn, and he had said that the plaintiff had imposed uponhir by representing himself as a surgeon. Never said he was no doctor. Cross-examined.-Did not consider a man competent who was not a member of the College of Surgeons. Persons only examined by the Apothecaries' Company were not expected to know surgery. They were examined as to anatomy. if a man was well up in anatomy he would not be competent to be a surgeon without being a member of the College of Surgeons. Did not know that the plaintiff had a certificate of his thorough knowledge of midwifery from St. Bartholomnew's Hospil. He was satisfied the plaintiff had dissected and attended anatomical lectures, and was proficent iR midw7ifery. By the JIDGL-Did not knaow wihat the plaintifrs knowledge was. The jury ultimately delivered a verdict for the plaintiff I -Damages, 751.

TRH FRIGHEM, ACCIDENT O.Y, TRE, NOL7UR KENT RAILWAY. ' Yesterday Thomas Perry, 29, driver, and Edward Whiffen, 24, fireman, i charge of the engine that caused the sad calamity w1hich occurred on the North Kent Railway on Sunday night, were again placed in the dock at ths Green. vich police-couart for re-examination. MIr. ReeB, solicitor to the South-Eastern Railway Company, attended for the company; Lr. Bargon appeared for the prisoners. George Abbott, of 10, Cottage-row, Bermondsey, deposed, -I was head guard of the train that left Strood at 9.30 on Sunday night last. The train consisted of 15 carriages in weight, the actual number being 12, inclading the break van. At Woolwich three more third-class carriages were pat on, making 18 carriages in weight and 15 in nuber. The train was an ordinary train in length. The train was full of passengers up to the third-class carriages attached at Blackheath. The train was due at 10.40 at Blackheath. We arrived at eight mninutes to IL There is great traffic on the line on Sunday evening, and it is difficult to keep time correctly. We arrived safely at Blackheath. The distance-signal was " green," or at " caution." This signal is 100 yards before we come to the Blackheath station -between the mouth of the tunnel and the Blackheath platform. We remained at Blackheath two minutes, to let out and take in passengers. The night watchman, named Curtis, was on the platform, arid Jupp, the porter. I can't say I saw the stationimaster there. The distance-signal would be at the rear of the train while wwere staying at Blackhcath. I was in charge of the train. The driver of my train would receive the signal to start from my under-guard, Godwin, who received it from me. I received the signal to start from. Mr. Chapman. I did not see him, hut heard his voice, " All right." I wras then about half-way up the train. I should imagine Mr. Chapmnan was standing near the booking-offlce when he gave the order to start. r considered tbat lustified me in sthrting the train, and immediately afterwards it started. I rode in the last break-van. The dutyof the head guard between stations is to sort parcels. During the tinie of leaving Blackheath I wras engaged in entering the numa. hers of the carriages taken on at Woolwvich. After pattidig the numbeors down I looked up and eaw the distance. signal red light at Lewrisha. The distance-signal is half-.. mile Or more from the Lewisbam station. 1 have seen the signal at the Lewisham station occasionally from Blackheath, and, with the exception of the two bridges, the signal is visible all the way. We were travellni about 20 miles an hour when I first saw the distance signal. When I first saw the distance signal at " danger" the train had jnst passed the firsb bridge crossing the line from Blackheath. I am certain it was a red light I saw. I did not see ik while staying at Blackheath-not looking in that direction. The weather was clear, but a little cloudy. We were booked to stop at Lewishamn. The speed of the train diminished quickly from the time of my seeing the danger signal. I applied the breaks, and, while doing so, I heard a single sharp whistle from the engine. Accordingto the code of regulations the whistle wonld be for a signal to the station. Auu bJguai ior appiyijig tue oreax is a successlon or whnies of a tremulous sound. There are two breaks in the train. There is also a break to the tender of the engine, in cbarge of the fireman. I cannot say whether either of the other breaks was applied at the same time I did. From the time I first sav the signal there 'would not be timo to pull up the train at the distance signal. When I saw the red light I put on the break. I put my head out of the 'window and saw what I took to be a red light at the tail of the train in advance. If'a proper look-out had been kept th'ese lights ought to have been seen long before I sawv it by the driver and firenan, and in that case the driver 'would have had time to puU up at the distance-signal; and as soon as the red light was seen by the driver he ought to have given me the signal to apply the break. The distance and station signals were both seen by me. Just after applying the bracs, and between the two bridges, I heard a whistle, lke that of a person whistling with his mouth and fingers. At the time of the collisien our train was travelling at about eight or ten wniles an hour. The collision took place inside the distance-ignaL Before leavIng Blackheath I heard no signal passed to Mr. Chapman, the station-master, by anyone. I have been 11 years and 5 months a guard in the employ of the company, aud on the North Rent line since its opening. Edward Danken Chapman, station-master at Blackheath, was next called, and decosed,-I was on duty on Sunday -ight last 'when the 9.85 train left Blackheath. To the best of my knowldge it left at 10.32 or 10.33. It would not have to stop at Blackheath. Every train is telegraphed to thq next station. I do not know from my own knowledge that the departure of the train was telegraphed to Lowish. The 9.30 train from Strood arrived at 10.54. I was on the platform when it arrived, but had left between the two arrivals. The 9.30 train remained two or three minutes at the station. I gave the signal to start to the guard, having first called to the signal-box from the office-door on the platform whether all was " clear up." The signal-box was 15 or 16 yards from where I was standing. The porter Griffiths was in charge of the signal, and in answer to my question he put his head out of the box, atd said, " All clear up, Sir," and from that I said to the guard, "All right." The guard was standing three or four yards from me, aid the train left. I was talking to the man Jupp at the end of the canopy of the London end of the platform, telling him I was glad the day's work was over, as had been much wearied and fatigued, and was about bidding him " good night," when I distinctly heard the colCisign. I rushed back to the bo: ana said to Griffiths, " For God's sake, the signal was correct lou gave me for the last train !" and he said" Ye4 yes; it's entered in my book." This was a minute or a minute and a-balf after the train left. I looked at the book, and will swear that the column for " return signals" was filed, and that the figures were 10.48. Thetime of thedeparture of the 9.30 train was also, tO the best of my belief, filled up. It is my practice to rely entirely on the signalman. Directly after the accidentI went tO the signal-box and saw the dial; the indicator applying to ewisham 'was at " Stop all up," which 'would indicate that a train was between Blackheathand Lewishatn. That signal would imply that Lewisham had acknowledged the approaching departure of an up-train. If Lewisham had not, however, acknowledged the departure of the 9.30 train, the ncedle would have indicated " All clear up." So that if Lewisham had not acknowledged. the departure the indicator would show the departure of the 9.15 train. The state of the telegraph at Blackhcath station immediately aftet the adeident 'showed'that either the signal " Al clear up " from Lewisham, without which the 9.30 traln ought not to have stgrted from Blackheath, had not been received at Blackheath, or that Lewis' hama had acknowledged the departure of' the 9.30 train. The 9.15 abd all 'up-trains are'telegraphed to Lewis"am jutst as they enter theo station, so as to get the reply fromI;ewishaim for the train to procecd. The receipt of teacknwledged'signal juistifies the departure of the train from Blackheath, and the signalman is responsible for the acouracy of the signaL.. By Mr. TRALL.-If the entries in this book be correct, the signalman at Lowisham must have given the signal " All clear up" at.tbe tiinethe 9.15 train was standing between the station a'udthe distant slinal. The 915 trair was a long train. Jobn Nelson, statidii-mastdr atLcwisham, was next examined.-I was on duty on the arrival of the 9.15 train at Lewisham from Strooc As far as I can recoUect it arrived at 10.40, but in the ordinary course ot things it would not stop. The reason of my stopping the train was in obedience to the telegraph, the indicator showing " Stop aU up" from Lewisham. 'The semaphore and dist'ance disc signals were up. The 9.15 train on coming in did not pass the distanoe signal, but stopped, and afterwards came within it. The semaphore signal is at the end of the station. The train did P not come up to the platforn. Passezgers were waiting on the platform for London. The train remained about 18 minutes before the collision. occurred. The collision took place at 10.55. The somaphore and distauce signals were at " danger ;" the whole of the line was stopping, and tbe 9.30 train, on approaching the station, .had the same signals against them which had brought up the 9.15 train, I fist became - aware of .the approach of the 9.30 i train by seeing it dart under the bridge, the engine having two white lights in.front.of it. I do not know of any telegraph sifgnal. being received from Blackheath between the time of the 915 train stopping and the collision. The signalmanwas DavidWilde. The signalman was in his box, but I know of my own knowledge that he was aware of the 9 15 train being stopped near the station. By Mr. TiAtiLL.-I am quite sure Wilde knew of the detontion of the 9 15 train, for I.told hii to run down and see if the train could take passengers on to London, and if so to draw up to the platform, and called to another, man (Saxby) to stay at the electric box, and stood there myself outside in a position to have heard if any signal had been roccived from liacithcath. By Mr. Burgon.-There have been complaints madce of the distant signal at the Lewisbam station, and probably there might have been complaints last week. I will not undertaske to say that Hill, the driver of the 915 train, had not complained to me within two days of the accident of the condition of the signaL I have no recollection of the distant signal having been recently repaired. [A conversation here took place betwveen Mr. TraM and Mr. Rees, when the latter gentleman left the court, and, having consultel with Mr. Eborall, the manager of the company, the result was that an application was made for the detention of John G-iffiths and David Wilde, the two signalmen at the Blackbeath and Lewisham stations ; and after the close of the case they were both taken into custody hnd charged with neglect of duty. They will be brought up for examination with the other prisoners tomorrdw.] Joln Bari-tram was the next witness. He said,-I was under-guard of the 9 30 p.m. train on Sunday from Strood. lMy van was next to the engine. I gave the signal, which I had previously received fromn the head guard, to the drivec to start from Blackheath. I did not hear any signal given to the sintionmaster. I saw the Lewisham junction signals 'when between the two bridges from Blaokheath, and applied the break. Thesignalwasaredlight. AfterIapplledthe break I heard the whistle of the engine, and the engine was reversed, but whether the steam was shut off or not I cannot sa3. We 'were going at a good rate, what I should call "fell swing." The sgpeed 'was afterwards slackened. Idid not aftezwards sae the driver and fireman. I also saw the station sgnal as well as the distaut signal. Both were red lights. Ve go up to a station as fast as w; can In Order not to stop short and lose time. On seeing the distant signal it is our duty to stop outside the distant signal, but we could not do so on Sunday night, because we were going so fast. Mr. Bargen asked if.his Worship thought the fireman ought tb be further detained, as he did aot think a jury 'would convict. Xn MTRA-LL saLd he weuld rather not say what a jury l 'he qitness Corner, in reply to a further question from no magistrate; said that whenever any uegleet of "look out" Iodk place the driver, and not the firemant,was punished by th,e mpay. t MXr.

I GENERAL ERWITT'S CONDUCT AT MEERUT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As the oxily brother of General Hewitt, commaanding the division of Ateerut, I hope you will permit me to say a few words in reply to the remarks of Lord Ellenborongh as to that officer. The date of his commission is 1806; and sirce tbat time he has not visited Europe, serving with his regiment, the 40th Bengal Native Infantry, where duty called him, and fortunate enough to be one of the few survivors of the first Burmese war, for which he has received his medal. Subsequently he commanded the stations of Moultan and Agra, and in 1853, under the governmenit of Lord Dalhousie, was appointed to the division of Peshawur, and thence promoted to that of Meerut, which divlsion he has commanded since the early partof 1854. Thus, altliough not having commanded a division or brigade in thefield (thanks to the peaceful state of India), he was not an officer "unknown." He is one of the few generals of division who has never quitted his divison since hii appointment, having always enjoyed excellent health, and therefore cannot be charged with absence from duty. As to the question whether his orders on the trying emergency, he had to encounter were judicious or not, it can only be decided when the whole of the facts are before the public. At present there are no despatches upon which the public cani form a judgment as to the true state of things at Meerut on the evening of Sunday, the 10th of May, the hour seleoted being 6 o'clock, while the British troops were at church. One thing, however, is clear that before dark (not very long after 6 in that latitude) the runtineers were dispersed and fled, many being captVred. But it is, said why not have pursned the fugitives One reason only would be a sufficient reply to that. Would it have been prudent to leave the two sepoy regiments at Meerut while the European troops were following the fugitives Heaven knows where-perhaps only to have returned two or three days afterwards exhausted by the heat and fatiguze, to find the horrors of Delhi re-enacted and the arsenal, Upon which ourhopes now rest, in the power of the enemy? what would have been said then? Instant punishm ment would have been invoked on tho author of such a | rash proceeding, and properly so. Two sepoy regiments -were restrained from joining thneir comrades while they saw -them shot own by the European troops, and we may therefore presume that the experience of an old officer of 50 years' service in India might not a little have contributed to that most fortunate result. It is all very well afterwards, when it is known that three regiments mutinied at Delhi, to say that the fugitives ought to have been pursued, but the best judges of what should be done under special cirdumstances as they ariseatthetime arethose on the spot, and with due regard to the safety of that position which it is their duty to keen and defend. Had Meerut shared the fate of Delhi what would our labours have been then ? You, Sir, as the defender and upholder of British power a-ad greatness, have pleaded for the unheard and absent who in a burning and deadly clime, are sustaining the honour and glory of their country, and will not refuse this appeal on bebalf of one of them, an old officer, to whom I cannot but think more courtesy might have beern extended, and at least a little time granted to hear what he bad to say. I am. Sir, your nblio,1rnt cP^ S. .HEWIT. Stirling, July 1. Tnn IRIsH Fu2iDS.-DUBLiN, Thursday.-Three per Cent.

ELECTION COMMITTEES. 3fAYO (COUNTY). The first vitness called yesterday on the part of the poeltionerwas Sir Richard O'Donnell, deputy lieutenant of the county of Mayo, and a supporter of Colonel Higgins. He said he had been engaged in a canvass of the Oonnty from the beginning of April untthe he election. Colonel Higgins wa supported by the Protestat gentry and clergy. Witness was a Protestant. At Ballina such exaitement prevailed that le and Colonel Higgins found it imposiie to continue their canvass, and the Ciolonel was forced to remain in his hotel for two days. When the Colonel showed hicaself at the door of the hotel a anumber of people, with whom were two priests, came up to them, and one man, the clerk of the chapel, called theColonel "traitor ind Castle hack." They left the town without canvassing it on the 18th. In the distriet of Tralee Colonel Higgins obtained 140 promises from voters, all of whom voted. On Friday, the 20th of March, he attended ameetingof Colonel Higgins's supporters, when a list of gentlemen who were desirous of supporting the Colopel was made out, but no committee was formed. At Castlebar the Colonel obtained upwards of 25 promises, but only five votes. The others voted against the ColoneL. at a town called Ballyhawniss he saw sis or eight Roman Catholic priests on a platform erected in the streets, one of whom was addressing a mob. He told them that Colonel Higgins had broken his pledges, that he was a traitor and a disgrace to his religion, and he called upon them to support Mr. Moore, as if they voted for Colonel Higgins they would vote against their religion. When the priest had concluded Colonel Higgins attempted to speak, but the priests and the mob prevented him, and there was a frightfnl row. On the 1st or April, as Colonel Higgins was addremsing a body of voters in another town, two priests arrived, one on horse. back with a thick whip in his hand, and the other on foot and told the people that Higgins was a traitor, and desired them to disperse. The witness then described what occurred at Castlebar during the nomination, and spoke to having seen Father Curly with a " breviary in his hand, and other siests leading on and exciting mobs to the attack of Colonel Uggins's supporters. Being on a canvass with the Colonel, he thought it his duty not to act in his magisterial capacity. Witness proposed, and Dean Burke(the only Roman Catholic priest in the county on their side) seconded Colonel Higgins. Four voters who had promised their votes to the Colonel, but who had voted against him, gave witness a reason for so doing. On the Sunday before the election he saw the Rev. Luke Ryan standing at the door of a publichouse serving out whiskey to a mob, and witness, with the assistance of the police, addressed and dispersed them. During the polling at Castlebar Ryan took MIr. Mvoore's voters up to the polL The 'witness then proved having seen the placard containing thewresolution of ameeting of the clergy at Castlebar i favoureof tssrs. Moore and Palmer, posted up at the committee-rooms of Moore and Palmer at Armsronf1s hoteL Mr. issf snlxe objected to this placard beng read as avidence against Mr. MSoore, and called upon his learned friend to prove that Mr. Moore had a committee-room at srmstrong's hoteL. Evidence having been given on this point, The committee held that the placard was admissible. The examination of Sir R. O'Donellws resumed. There wrere 404 voters who did not poll; 1,041 voted for Colonel inggins, and Mrg Moore had a majority of 128 votes over Colonel Higgins. There were between 1,230 and 1,250 pro mises for Colonel Higgins. After the excitement and rioting commenced the voters fell back and refuted to goto tohe poll for the ColoneL. CrOss-examined.-At previous elections he had received promises which had not been performed. Many of the voters he canvassed were tenants of Lord Lucan. h e did not know that Lord Lncan just before the election declared that he was aaspporter oE Mr. Moore. Witness was chairman of Colonel Hliggins's committee. Lord Dillon's tesiantry upaorted Colonel Higgius. He believed thtAt it was usual forpriests to carry breviarias about with them. or was not unusual in Ireland for the romen of the lower classes to take part in disturbances. In the proposing Colonel HIggins witness called Captain Palmer an Orangeman. Dean Burke compared the craelties practised on Captain PalmerIs estate to the inhuman conduct of Pifarro in South America. Other pretty strong speeches were made. Each party was loudly cheered by its supporters. About 20 free. holders were taken to the house of his son, a short distance from newport, the night before the election. A voter named Francis Sweeny was there nearl drunk. He did not knowh that Sweeny was locked ap that night. About 50 of witness's tenautry wera voters, and all but four or five plumped for Colonel figgins. There were several meetings of gentlemen aho supported Colonel Higgins, for the purpose of secuinug his return. Re-examined.-The voters were taken to his son's house for protection. Dr. John MacHale was then called and esamined by Mr. I. Jh -In anspw er to the learned counsel's hrst question -veat position he held in the Romdse Catholic Cherch-he said I amethe Archbishop of Tuam. The Cn.ernarsuw.-The committee are perfectly willing to recoguize your title of archbishop, hut you are aware that we cannot recognize yoa by the territorial title of Archbishop of Tnam. Dr. NacHale.-I believe I an certain that I msn the Archbishop of Tuam, but I do not wish to do anything that may be offensive to the committee, and if that is not my legal identification I shall be perfectly satisfied waith the title of archbishop. A larme portion of the county of Mayo iS in my diocess. The priesSs of that diocess, both the parish priestsand the curates, are appointed byme. Thereare about 53 parishes in the county. I appoint about 35 of the parish priests. There are more chapels than parishes. I have the power of removing and suspending parish priests if they deserve it-for canon,ical reasons only. If they were proved to have produced riots I could iuspend them. The Bev. Peter Conway was never my secretary, although he niay have written a letter for me. lhere are two parishes set apart to contribute to my episcopal revenues-Tuam and Kiiuena. The priest who has care of Eilmena, the R1ev1 Louke Rya, is my admiuistrator, appointed and removable byme. There are three persons whoact conjointly ao ud. mfuistrators and caurates i Tuam-the Rev. Messrs. Conroy, Coyne, and Corcoran. I have power to remove Mtr. Ryan at my discretion, without ny canonical reason; but I should not exercise it capriciously or withoat a very good reason. Mr. Curly may have happened to warite a letter for me, but he hs not my.seoretary. I allowved him to .write this letter (produced) to the Parliamentary *eent. It hi sined by hmn as my secretary. EIe happened to be in my house at the time, and I got him to write the kletter as Imad other business to attend to. Curly camo over wIth me to England. He officates in the parish of Kilgeever. The Rev. Mr. Hosty is the curate of a parish near Castlebar. The Rev. Mr. Cahill and the Rev. Mfr. Green belong to the samnepsrish. The Rev. Mr. yh'Eviy belongs to Newport, and the 31ev. Mr. Joyce to Eicommon. They were appointed by me. Swnfordgis not in mydiocess. I never appointed any one to that pariah. I don't put my sickle in another man's harvest. [The learned counsel then read theonames of some other priests who had been ap- pointed E the witness.] I also appolinted Archdeacon trhtln. Ith present at the ceremony of laying the foundation of a Roman Catholic chapel at Eoinsberg in September. Nr. Curlyvvasalsopresent. When the ceremonywas over I retired. Mr. G. H. MIoore was present. He was introduced by Father Cutly. I think I retured before Mr. Moore addressed the people. 1 have no recollection of Mr. Mioore's haing called me the "illustrious archbishop and the groat champion of the people." I have no recollection that fr. Mioore sad that the lergy, nnder the advice of the great archbishop of the wes, wounld decide npon the way in which thepeople ought to vote. I sill neither negative nor affirm that Iheard such n expression. It is very unlikely that I should have heard and acquiesced in it, as Iam neither the archbishop of the west nor agreatarchbishog. Even if that had been sid I should have attached very lIttle importance to it. Mar. Moore spoke immediately after the conclusion of tho religious ceremony. I dare say be made the speech on the ground which I had just consecrated. A meeting of the bishops and several of the clergy connected with the county of Mr.yo ws heldJat wuamon the 22d of Mareh in my house. It was a casual meeting, not a meeting convened by reouition. It took p lace on the occasion of the consecration of the Bishop of Gaowayn tMr. B. Jthisr .-Did you sign a resolution to the effect that ll the energies of the meetingt should be directed to promote the rejection of Colonel iggins, who had been found unfaithful to his promises, and the return of 11r Moore who had been honest and faithful?7 Witness.-ive me the document, and I will toillyou whether it bears my signatukre. Mr. M. Siram objected to the question. HIis learned friend could not ask the wvitness whether he bad signed a document without producing that document. Witness.-If a document is shown to me I will tell the commnittee whether I signed it. I don't wish to shrink from the zesponsibility of anything tha I have done, hut I do not feel called upon to answer from memory a question as to my signature to a document containing a great miany words, all of which Iamn unable to remember. 1 did sig,n a resolution at that meeting, hut I will not say whether I signed that resolution (looking at a newspaper). I don't know where the document is that I dlid sign. It strikes me that you have'not stated the purport of theresolution we adopted. Mr. Jrss.- What was the purport of the resolution you sieDed? Witness.-The purport was that the meeting, should use all their exertions to support a faithful man (MIr. Moore), bu yipession is that Colonel Higeins was not mentioed,I an'tknow whether I read ihe newspaper containing this resolution after the meeting. It is a paper I seldom see. I sometimes read the Tuzaan Herald. but there are many advertisements and notices in it which I never read. I am not conscious of ever having written an article in tholTuamHerald, althoughIhave stutmypastoralletters to tho office. I think there were laymen at the meeting. Mr. Swift. the former member for Sligo, was there, I think. Bishop Thomas Feeny was also there. Bishop Darkin was not immediately present, as he was sick. Bishops Feeny, Durkin, and M'Evilly signed the resolution. I ama not sure whether the Ravs. R. Hosty, Green, and Cahill were there. Father Conway, I believo, was there. I an not sure whether Father Curly and Father Ryan were there. I drew up the resolution myself; yet, short as it is, I don't think you have a perfect transcript of it. MIr. Swift had been present at the ceremony. I am not aware that Mr. Swift has any connexion with Mayo. He had come to ask me about the S1igo election. I don't reallyknov what became of the resolution after I had signed it; probably left it on the table. I had Signed it in order to convey my sentiments to the electors with regard to the merits and demerits of the candidates for Mayo. I did not know whether it was to be publisbed or not. I did not direct its publcation. I know now that it has been published. Iam not awarethatanything was saidatthe meeting about its publication. Mr. E. JAME-Did you intend it as a direction to the pariah priests ? Witness,-There were no directions given to the parish priests. I last saw the resolution on the table of the room where the meeting was held. Colonel NoRTH.-Is this the first time you have seen it published? Witness.-I do not remember whether or not I have seen it publishMd before. Mr. E. XA S.-Do you not know that it was given to Mr. Kelly, the proprietor of the Tuamn Herald, for publieation ? Witness.-Possibly it was. I may have read it in the Tvann EcrosW, but I have no recollection of having done so. I wasat Castlebar the day of the nomination. If Iheadh sure that I had a right to mominate Mr. Moore I solR probably have done it. ItWent to Castlebsrbecan6 i toel an interest in the election.- Iwas toldt.#Lat nmypxme was' r not ori the register,' and that I should not ha all^wedto` speak. I don't know whethrir that W told me at Castlebarr, butIIhaddetermineinotto speak. It w not told'a e the steps of the Codrtthouse. I saw Mr. Moore-on of the3nomination at a good distance from the r. house. Three or four priests a ere 'with me, but uwbishops. I remained at Castlebar the entire d r Mloore called at Mr. Hosty's house, where I after the nomination. I met the Rev. James Brdwn t; Castlebar. I spoke to him, hut not on the sbject of the. election. I said to him something to the effectthat: respected an open enemy but detested a secrot foe. That, had no reference to the election. It referred to a matterconnected with the election,- to a resolution adopted by M1r., Brown, at a meeting at Castlebar some time previouslv which appeared to me rather imprudent. I thonght th& resolution imprudent inasmuch as it remarked impradently upon the editor of the Freeman's ournal, avery respectable& paper, for haviDg given what Xr. Brown thought a partial account of certain proceedings, and it identifiect that gentleman's conduct with "S.dleirism." It also paid what I thought an undue complimentI.- to an agent for some landed property in -Mayo. Therg was an impression that Mr. Brown was favourable to. Colonel Higgins. 3Mr. Brown afterwards plumped for Mr. AMoore. I did not mention to him the mame of DeanBnrkea I knew he was supporting Colonel Eigins. The foUowvn day I went home. Mr. Moore lives with his mother. IdiT nos callat Mr.M oore's on my wayhome. I was not at Castle. bar during the polling. I remained at Tuamn during thus election. I did not hear anything about the conduct of Father Conway. He may have called at my houso. kince theelection. I have been at his house since the elec. tion,at the ylsitation. I was invited to a dinner of Mr. Moore's supporters at Westport after the electionf, on th&e 14th,of ApriL I sent a letter to excuse, my attendance. X have'not seenFather Ryan sinceIcame to London. TheRevJ Mr. Green is a ourate. I was not present in a chapel whem. the ),etition of Colonel Higgins against Mr. Moore's returtz vas read by him. I have no recollection of havinzg heard it. read; but at the same time I have no doubt that it waa. read. Ir. B JTA3ms.-Has not that petition been read in ath6 chapels of your dioceas with your sasiction and knowe ledge? Witness.-I do not know. It may have beei read or it may not. I gave no directions about it. It has not come tCmy knowledge as archbishop that it has been read in thoxd. chapels. Vlo sanction of the reading hAs been given by me. A great deal depends -upon the discretion of the priest as to & what is read in chapels. Mr. E. JAMYr.-.-ave you a right to suspend a priestwhodenounces a candidate fzom the altar ? Witness.-Denounces! What do you mean by that? Mr.E. JAscs.-Do you call it a denunciation when w priest Esys from the altar, "The curse of God will come, down upon any one who votes against his country and fot Colonel' Higgims 2" Witness.-I will givo rny opinion on that caSe when ift comes before me in my judicial capacity. I beg leave tUdecline giving my opinion on it now, because it may here. after he brought before me for mny decision as archbishop. It is not right for a priest to denounce any one. fronm the altar on political. grounds. It has notcome to my knowledge in my offlial capacity that Colonel Biggins has been denounced from the altars ot my diocees. No complaint has been made tome on the subject, and I have not therefore suspended any nriest on sacount of what he did at the eleetion. Ido not listen in such. cases to mere rumours. Mr. French has not complalned to me of the conduct of any priest at the altar during theelection. Since the election I have subscribed 101. to the, "Moore Indemnity Fund," for the purpose of defendine the return of Mr. Moore. I may have mentioned thei- iubscription as a very proper one to my clergy at mp visitation. They have taken it up without any suggestlon of mine. I think there aro laymen in Mayo whohave subscribed to the fund. I can't give you the name of one of those laymen-that shows how little conversant I am; with these matters. (Laughter.) At the time of the election several parisbes were vacant. They are still vacant. Among tbem are Castlebar and 1l3common. Castlebarmaybe one of the most lucrativeparishes in the diocems. Idon't, regard the most lucrative parish as the best. I have notl. fled -up any parish since the election. Sometimes it isi usual to leave parishes vacant. Sometimes it is not. [The witness then entered into an explanation of thnreasons why the parishes of Castlobar and Kilcommon ha been left vacant, the effect of which, as we understood, was that their revenues were required for purposes connectec with the church. I do not keep, lie continued, an electioneering office. I never gained a sispence-halfpenny by any election. I am brought here because I am supposed tobe implicated in various political proceedings, but Ihasve been a loser rather than a gainer by my connexion witha olitics. I can clear myself before the committee, now thatamon my oath, from the imputation of everhavinggainedl anything directly or indirectly, in the way either of patronage or of money, from any election. In aU that I have done I have been pro ted by no other feeling than that. of a deep sense of duty. In answer to further questions. by Mr. B. JA.s the witness said,-I have never seen the manuscript of the resolution since I signed it. I don't indeed know where it is now. Candidates for Mayohave been in the habit of applying to me. I am nbt awarethat I applied to a gentleman to start for the county, anui told him that I would adopt and return him. I do not remember whether 1 did or not. I think that is a just and! right answer. I will not say that I did not, but it is very' improbable that I should do such a thing. By the ComNsTTzE.-No one before to-day ever called., my attentiou to the fact that a resolution was published ir. the newspapers different from that which I signed. Cross-examined by Mr. X. Srm.-Although I hold the office of archbishop, Icertainly think I have a right-nay, that it is my duty-to express my sentiments as to the merits and. demerits of the different candidates for Mayo. In my opinion. that is a question of morality as well as of politics. I know- no persons who have m,ore important duties to dischargo . than legislators, members of Parliament, as on them it d.e pands whether tbe country is to be governed by wise andi benefiial laws or by such a penal code as that with which Ireland was lately afflicted, and therefore it ls essentlaW that none but good men should be returned to Parliament, Colonel NonTiL-But do you think that you have anr right to make use of violent means to enforce your opinions ? Witness.-No. In answer to that question I will read a portion of a pastoral letter,whieh contains my instruction* to the clergy of my diocess with regard to the last eleetion. The witness was about to read this pastoral when It waEP announced that the Speaker was at prayers, and the comemittee adjourned until 11 o'clock this morning. The committee-room was more crowded during the exa. mination of Dr. M'Halo than it has been since the comxmencement of the inquiry, and the audience listened to his& evidence with the greatest attention. The space allotted to. members of the House behind the chair was also completely' filled until the adjournment of the committee. CAMBRIDGE (BOROUGH). The committee resumedtbe scrntinyyesterdaymorning,am the casesinqureintobemgthoseofnon-rsideence Twovotes for the petitioner and one vote for the sitting member wereB struck off, and two cases were left undecided. The resublt was that at the rising of the committee the sitting membeeD and the petitioner had the same number of votes. PONTEFRACT. The case for the sitting member was proceeded with yesterday, when evidence was called to rebut the statementa. of the two Aireys, James Stones, and others, who had sworn to acts of intimidation and treating, and offers to bribe on. the part of the agent of the sitting member. Mr. Carter, solicitor to the Yorkshire Banking Company, gave an explanation of the affair of the writ, by wlachit; was alleged an attempt had been made to intimidate Airey. It was issued and served in the usal course of business, and. the only reason why it had not been served before the election was that it had been forgotten by his clerk, owingu to the great press of business in his office. He denied that; Airey'1 vote had ever been mentioned or thought of in connexion with the writ, and he gave a flat contradiction to' Airey's statement that in canvassing him he (Carter) had said to him, " I you don't vote for Wood it shall be worse, for you.' Mir. Sidney Wolff, who was alleged to have threatenecl Airey, and to have offered his son Edward Airey a bribe of101. to vote for the sitting member, was also examined, and. contradicted circumstantially the evidence of these twovwitnesses on these two points. Ha denied that he had everused any threat to Airey. He was not aware that Aireywas indebted to the bank, and therefore could not have made use of that as a means of intimidation. With regard to the younger Aircy, so far from having offered to bribe bim Airey had asked him for money for his vote, which he ha& refused to give him, and had told him distinctly that he need not expect to get any bribe from the sitting member, as he did not intend to resort to any such means of gaining his election. This witness was also examined as tot treating at the Anchor Inn, and he denied that a single word had been said on that occasion relative to the election, orthat he or anyone else of his party had invited persons to drnk at their expense. Other witnesses were examined who gave similr evidene, completely contradicting the statements of the petitionere' witnesses. WAREHAML The committee sat, with closed doors, from ll o'cloobz yesterday morning nntil half-past 4 in the afternoon. The CsArrar then announeed that the committee ha1 agreed to resolutions that the sltting member. Mir. Clcraft, was duly elected, that the voters Davis and Baker had been bribed by Pike, bat that Pik-e had bribed them without the k-nowledge of the sitting member, and that those voters together with three others, whose names they mention ed'i onght to be struck off the list.
O0mSMUcTINv A RPA wAy.-At the Devon Quarter Sessions on Tuesday, before Sir J. Duckworth, a lad of 12? yeass of age, named James BaMdon, wascbarged with placing a wheelbarTow on the North Devon Railway, by which tho lives of the passengers were greatly endan"ered. It appea&ed that the lad, a few days ago, placed the wv eelbaTrow oD the, line at Coleford just before the arrival of tbe night mailtrain. The train came on at full speed, and split the barrow into fragments, which flew about the head of the enrine. driver, and might have caused serious if not fatal injury. The obstruction being thus fortuately smshbed into pxecesjr the train passed on without any injury being done to thee passengera. The prisoner, who pleaded "Guilty," was sentenced to two mnonths' imprisonment. tAdvertisement.p-Literar Goesip.-"Thegreatsrocessiof'Never Too Lateo Ia end'at thegoiceot 56..
