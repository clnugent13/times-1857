INDIA. No. II. TO THE EDITOB (YF THE TIMES. 'Sir,-I now proceed to that part of my subject 'which relates to military affalrs. In reorganizing the military administration of India, we mayWborrow a principle from our Norman anceJtors-to keep the keys of the military power in our own hands; but we should temper it with another from our Saxon ancestors-to preserve the religion and rights of the people inviolate. This is the time for remoulding our policy. After what has passed we shall in reason be expected to tske effectual steps for our security; and such is the power of custom and habit (dustoor) over the native mind, that the arrangements so made will soon become a matter of course. For the sake of the natives themselves we must be quite decided in our action on this point. Settled tranquillity is the indispensable preliminary condition of Indian improvement of every kind, and this cannot be obtained unless it is made apparent that any attempt to resist our power would be hopeless and would be followred by Bwiift and certain punishment. The material basis of our militazy powter in Indha is the railroad system. The facility thus obtained of speedily concentrating a superior force on any given point not only enables a small force to do the work of a large one, but gives to a small force a prompt and decisive efficacy which a large one, without this assistance, could not have. This may be at once proved by considering what would have been the effect upon the military operations at Delhi, Cawnpore, Lucknow, and other stations, even with the insufficient European force which we then possessed, if the [projected railways had been completed. So certain is it that railroads are better tan regiments, that it would be for the interest of England, even in a strictly economical point of view, to diminish the drain upon her worldng population bv lending her credit to raise money for hastening the completion of the Indian railways. The Sepoys were so bent upon making the reform of our army complete, that they not only dissolved it, but destroyed the cantonments in which it was quartered. These were co*ucted, according to the custom of the Indian service, in the order of an extended camp; and the principal stations, such as Heerut and Cawnpore, covered so large an area, that they required almost as strong a force to defend them as to occupy them; and a long time might elapse before what was done in one part of them was known in other parts. The bungalows in which the officers resided were Inflammable thatched houses, each of which was situated in its own compound, or large square enclosure; and the powder magazines and depots of stores were exposed without protection in the openplain. I'Places of arms," capable of defeneg by small numbers, ought to be constructed at every military station, in which the stores, the treasure, and the sick should be placed, leaving as large a body as possible to be moved in any direction in which their presence might be required. The railway stations should be so placed and built as to be under the protection of these "Places of Arms," and to be themselves capable of defence, according to the plan adopted in some of the Prussian fortresses. It will also be deserving of consideration whether this opportunity should not be taken of providing substantially built quarters for officers, constructed and arranged on military principles, with a proper regard to the climate, instead of leaving the officers to erect bungalows for themselves, and[to pass them from one to another, on the occasion of each relief, at the cost of frequent pecuniary embTrrassment. As the reconstruction of the dwellings of the officers must be defrayed either directly or indirectly from the public purse, the outlay should be made in the manner most beneficial to the public and private interests concerned. All fortifications which cannot conveniently be defended by the European portion of our army should be destroyed, and no native State should be permitted to maintain a military force which, from its composition and character, would be dangerous to us. There will be no difficulty in giving effect to this principle. The forces of the Rajpoot, Sikb, and other really national native States, are, for the most part, a mere feudal militia from whom no danger is to be apprehended. The Gwalior, Malwa, and Kotah Contingents, on the other hand, were mercenary standing armies, which had been raised by our own officers on the same principles and from the same materials as our own Sepoy army. The prohibition to possess arms without a special license, which has been enforced with so much success in Sinde and the Punjab, should be extended to the North-Western Provinces and Oude, and to other districts as circumstances may render this measure expedient. Our Sepoy army was chiefly employed, not so much in the support of the civil power as in the actual performance of civil duties, such as guarding the kutcherries, gaols, and treasuries, furnishing escorts, &c. All these services ought to be executed by a police force organized on the principle of the Irish constabulary and the English county police. The police of each district should be under the command of a separate EuroDean officer, who in the disposal and emDloyment of the force should act in subordination to the civil authorities, and it would be his duty to make it as effectual as possible for police purposes by the formation of a local pro-. fessional " detective" element. There should also be European inspectors to exercise a general superintendence like that exercised by the InspectorGeneral of Constabulary in Ireland and the Inspectors of Constabulary in England, and to make thte experience of the whole available for the improvement of every part. By this measure the army would be restored to its true functions of a reserve force, to preserve the public peace when the civil power is unequal to the task; and it might be reduced within much narrower limits, and be maintained in a much higher state of efficiency than heretofore. One main cause of the inferior state of discipline of the Bengal army has been the large proportion of it constantly detached on civil employment. The native portion of the army might also then be fixed in such a ratio to the European portion as might be considered desirable. There should be no military station occupied entirely by a native force. Everywhere there should be a proper proportion of European troops. With the aid of railways and of the reformed plice, the smaller military stations, which will always our weakest points, may, for the most part, be abandoned. The artillery, and the persons employed in the arsenals and magazines, in the manipulation of the more scientific instruments of warfare, such as copper caps and fuses, should be entirely European. In this respect we might take a lesson from Runjeet Singh, who acted systematically upon the plan of getting every piece of ordnance in the Punjab into his own hands. Care should be taken to recruit each portion of the native army from various districts and different castes, so as effectually to prevent it from again becoming a family compact or religious fraternity. Soldiers may indulge their personal tastes when they are off duty, but no excuse of caste or of any other religious or social observance should be permitted to interfere with the full performance of military duty. Both the European and native troops should be practised in the construction of intrenchments and other works connected with neld operations and with the defence and attack.of bePsieged places. The formation of the places of arms at the different military stations will furnish suitable employment, for them for some time to come. Every enlistment should be for general service, whereby the local character of the Bengal Army, which has been a fruitful source of embarrassment, discontent, and even of actual mutiny, will be obviated. The native officers should be promoted for merit, and not for seniority; and we should then be able to offer some inducement to fidelity and zeal, and should have efficient native officers upon whom we could depend. As regards the European officers, we have to re- construct the Bengal Army as a profession. In prlvate employments the self-interest of each indi. vidual furnishes a sufficient stimulus to exertion; but in the case of bodies of public servants, who work, not directly for themselves, but on trust for others, the requisite motives have to be provided by careful arrangement. Owing to the great extension ofd thePrtishpossesajons inlndia of late yearsand the coiequent demand for officers for civil employ, military officers have been taught to look to the civl sevie as their principal field for honourable and 2profit0le advancement. The military profes- sioi has faJle.n into a state of disparagement. O)fficers who have not acquitted themselves well in the civil lne, are "'remai;ded to their regiments" as if they, were penal corps; and those who remain with their regiments slffer under a sense of disappointAwnt and wounded self-esteem, which makh it irapoaible for them to have their heart inthe work This state of thlngs must be remedied, and the ul I professional motives must be brought to bear with full force on the railitary servioe before there can be any hope of solid improvement. For the attainment of thia important object two conditfons are Indispensable,- L That the line of promotion of the civil and military services should be completely separated; and 2. That adequate rewards and distinctions should be provided for the military service. kSo many things are necessary for the proper flulfilmnent of these conditions, that it will onl be possible to touch upon a few of the leading points. The continuance of our dominion iTuIdia dependsentirelyuponthe superiority of the Eaglish employed in India over the natives of the country in character and acquiremeent. It is therefore necessary that there should be some selection of the persons so employed. It is suicidal to allow India to be a refuge, as it is at present to a great extent, for those of our youth who are least qualified to make their way in their own country; and it is such an insult to the natives, who are fu'l of intelligence and are making great progres in European knowledge of all kinds, that if anything could excuse them for rebelling, it would be this. Tha best practical arrangement at present, would ba for the 13irectors to nominate three or four candidates for every vacancy, and for the beat of these to be selected by independent examiners ap. pointed for the purpose. This would combine tbo advantages of nomination andcompetition. We shotui reserve whatever benefit is supposed to be derived rom a presumed knowledge of the previous career of the young men, and should add to it some seouri on behalf of the public that the best of the candidates would be chosen. Better candidates would also be put forward when it was known that they would have to be measured with others. The examinations should be oollective and periodical, so that if there were 50 vacancies there would be 200 candidates. Those who failed the first time might be allowed one, and only one,* more trial. After the cadets have been selected, they ought aU of them to have at least one year's professional instruction at a military college. There are several reasons for this,- 1. To test the moral qualties of the young men before they are committecl to an Indian career. Those who fail in this probation should be at onoe elminated. 2. To teach them drill and the first elements of military science, so that they may take their place in oommand of the native officers with mutual respect, and, 3d. To teach them the elements of the native languages, which can be learned with grater faclity and exactness from well-insucted Earopean Professors than from Moonahees and Pundits There should be two colleges, one for the artillery and engineers and the other for the infantry and cavelry; and tie young men should have the choice of these branches of the service in the order in which they excel in the preliminary examination. After the young men have arrived in India and been posted to their regiments, they should have to pass one more examination in speaking and wrritini the native languages and n rnilitary history and science. This should be upon the fixed test principle, but the young officers should be enoouraged to take up extra subjects, or, in other words, to go up for honours. It should not be left, as it is at present, to the discretion of a young man whether he will pass in the native languages or not. The power of understanding his men and of rendering himself intelligible to them should be considered an indLspensable qualification; and those who cannot, or will not, acquire this necessary accomplishment should be removed from the service. The office of Regimental Interpreter and the practice of interpreting at courts-martial should be abolishedi Every officer should be presumed to understand the language of his soldiers. The pedantic, puerile, licentious Bagh1o-bahar should be discarded as a textbook, and manuals should be compiled more closely representing the actual language of the camp and country. A proper system of military inspection should be established to test the professional qualifications of officers of every rank. General officers who have had practical experience of the duties of the different grades, can ascertain by two or three days' inspection, not only the state and general management of a regiment, but also the comparative state and management of the different companies composing it; and they can, of course, see that every field officer has so far qualified himself for promotion as to be able to put a brigade, and every captain a regiment, through its manceuvres. When a foundation has been laid by these measures, the existing system of promotion by pure Eeniority should be largely modified. The promotion up to, and including the rank of captain should be entirely regimental, as at present, and should depend chiefly on seniority; but every really distinguished officer should have early promotion, and every officer who had seriously misconducted himself should be passed over. From the rank of major upwards, the promotion should be general throughout each branch of the army, and should be entirely by selection. In order to prevent regiments from being weakened by withdrawing officers from them In addition to those who must necessarily be absent on fTurlough and sick leave, and to give officers of every branch of the service a further inducement to exert themselves, a separate line of promotion, with a higher rate of pay for each grade, ought to be established for the Staff. Admission to the Staff should depend upon a competing examination of the most practical kind, for which all officers who have served three years with their corps should be eligible; and when they have been admitted, they should serve one year with each of the branches of the army to which they did not previously belong, in order that they may have that general acquaintance with the work and wants of the army which is indispensable for officers on the General Staff. Besides the purely military duties of the Staff, the officers of this corps should be charged with the services performed by the British Commissatiat and the French Intendance, as well as with the care of the studs and some other duties peculiarly Indin. The abolition of the pure seniority system, and the establishment of a Staff corps upon these principles, will infuse new life into the Bengal army. The commanding officer is to a military body what the head is to the human body; and after the deplorable consequences we have lately seen of intrusting such powers to incompetent persons, it will hardly be again proposed that the appointments to regiments and to the higher comma=ds should be made on any other principle than that of selecting the officers who are believed to be the best qualified. The remedy for another great evil affecting our native army is dependent upon this. Commanding officers cannot be Intrusted with the powers necessary to secure the respect of their men, until provision is made for having at the head of every native regiment officers who can be relied on to make a proper use of those powers. The effeet of the change of system on the general character of the officers will also be extremely beneficial. Under a pure seniority system an officer's promotion goes on precisely in the same manner 'whether he exerts himself or takes his ease; and as few love exertion for its own sake, the majority take their ease. Under a system of selection according to qualification and servlce, promotion is dependent upon exertion, and the majority consequently exert themselves. Those only who know the Bengal army, can form some estimate of the amount of idleness and bad habit, engendered by the seniority system co-operating with the ener. vating influences of the climate, which would be converted into active interest in professional duty, by the substitution of a well-considered system of promotion according to qualification and good service. Brigadier-General Jacob truly observes that " qualfications, not numbers, are necessary for the leaders of native Indian soldiers." If they were well Eelected, well Instructed, and well paid, a small establishment of Enropean officers would be better for a native corps than a large one, but care qhould be taken always to keep the eetablishtaent up to its full complement. | This opportunity should also be taken of consolidating the pay and allowances both of officers and mien, and of placing them on a simple and intelligible footing suited to the present circumstances of the service. The uncertainty of the Indian allowAnucc has been the most prolific source of mutiny in '* *] P a the Indi Hous of Alowing the young 2nnt u gi and: ~;agIn till thiey have been cranmmed 'auto to.xn-r, -trysthQg usg pi _tb examination as a former y"rtA and the purely mercenary spiriw engendered by it has probably largelycontribated to the pretet military insurrection. It would not be diffiult to prePre aWleof pay, allowances, andretiring pensions for the Bengal army which 'Would make al ranks, from the regimental commandig officer to the private, feel that they were justly and liberally dealt with; and, combined with the other proposed arrangements, would cause admision to the service to be regarded as a privilege, and dsmisal frGm it as a severe punishment, which is the true test of a sound military system. The allowances received by officers at any rate must be revised if quarters are provided for them at the expense of the State. Tbe operation of the Bengal Military Fund in removing, by arti6icial regla tions, the natural restraints upon the marriage of young officers, ought also to be seriously coneidered. If this policy should be adopted, the number of appointments to the Civil Service would be much increased, and it would becomo more necessary than ever to consider whether further improvements cannot be introduced into that branch of the service. The reasons which have been given for pasing military cadets through a perlod of professional instruction previously to their being sent to India, apply with still greater force to the young men who have been selected for the civil service. This was to some extent provided for by the report of the commimioners for considering the best means of giving effect to the provisiois of the recent Act of Parliament relating to the appointment of civil servants, but their recommendations have not been acted upon. The experience which has crowded upon us in the last few months showrs how much caution is required in applying general principles to Indian affairs. Our present difficulties are due, in some degree, both to the neglect of the fundamental minrim of Ango-Inaian admninstration, that the religious and social prejudices of the natives sre, above all things, to be respected, and to a mistaken and exaggerated application of that maximn. But about this there can be no doubt, that to recast the Bengal military system on oorrect principles-to make a proper selection of young men to represent our nation in India-to see that they are able to understand the natives and to take an interest in themto give to our officers adequate motives forhonourable exertion, and to select the ablest of them for the most important employments, will deepen the foundations of our Eastern empire in a manner which will be as much for our benefit a for that of the large portion of the human race which has been intrusted to us.

THE BENAL ARMY. TO THE EDITOBR OF THE TMES. Sir,-Were Brigadier-General Jacob at present in this country it would be presumptuous in any one to undertake the defenco of his opinions; but as, in his absence, his pam. phlet on the Bengal army. republished in your impression of the 12th Inst, has been attacked in a letter which appeared In your columns on the 22d inst., under the signature of " P. Phippe Colonel Bengal Army," I trust that I may be permitted to mrake some remarks on the subject. Colonel Phipps begins by stating that General Jacob was mistaken in asserting that he was well acquainted with the Bengal army, and undertakes to overthrow the whole of his oase by disputing the accuracy of three out of his eight assertion, which areto the effect that " among the most Eerlous evils" of the Bengal Army are- " Par. 6. The moet pernicious practice of attending to the caste of native soldiers, &c. " Par. 7. The very bad aud injurious system of promotion exiting with respect to native offioers and soldiers. " Par. o. The entire absence of a proper discipline throughout the native part of the Bengal army." Colonel Phipps proceeds with bis refutation in this wise:First, he endeavours to throw doubt on General Jacob's veradty by saying that in the instances adduced in support of his various statements he " avoids naming any particular regiment." Does Colonel Phipps consider the omission attributable to an incapacity on the part of General Jacob to produc. the names, or to a generous desire of avoiding, in an attack on a vicious svstem, any approach to personality ? Secondly. In answer to paragraph 6 we are told a long story of the conduct of a Bengal regiment in the year 180W, aud the physical inferiority of two Bombay regiments at the Fame period. That is, because one Bengal regiment in 1800 consented to dig wells and behaved admirably in the field, therefore General Jacob is wrong in saying that in the year 1850 the Bengal Sepoy was more afraid of an offence against his caste than against the Articles of War; that he prided hlmself on being a Hindoo rather than a soldier; and that a commanding officer had " been compelled to discharge an exoellent Sepoy because the other men had discovered him to be of inferior caste and demanded his dismissaL" Thirdly. We are shown the utter inaccuracy of paragraph 7 by tho example of the 2d battalIon 13th Bengal Native Infantry. "In this regiment the soldiers who showed moet intelligence and activity were selected for promotion as drill instructors," while "the sergeants who were too old for active service were invalided," the result of which was that "no regiment could have been in a higher state of disipline and efficiency," and that after a long march they murmured not when ordered to feU trees and level ground. Now, wvhat says General Jaoob ?- " The 7th evil, the bad system of promotion, is the worst of all-its effects are crnshingly ruinous. In the Bengal army the promotion of natives is made to depend on srniority only." The consequence is that the soldier does not exert himself. There is no co-operation between him and his officer, and the native offlcors are so old that they "all should have been pensioned long ago;" but if, on the otherhand,comxnandlng offioers "really and honestly do their best to choose men for promotion . . by merit and fitness alone, it is soon found "that every men in the regiment . . exerts himself to aid his officers. A degree of vigour and activity, amounting to a new life, is infused into every part of the regiment." Colonel Phipps's answer, therefore, amounts to this-a commanding officer having aoted in the exact manner reoommended by General Jacob, it was found that the results of this oonduct were precisely those which he had predicted. So complete a parallel to Balsam's cursing of the Israelites is seldom found I Fourthly. General Jacob fell into a "gross mistake" in " alleging" that "the Native Cavalry are composed of men of such high caste that they wll not groom their own horses." Now, what General Jacob did " allege" was, that " a regi ment of Native Cavalry, as he had repeatedly witnessed was unable to picket, unsaddle, or groom its horses untii the arrival of its syces and grasscutters" "Oh I no," says Colonel Phipps, "this is quite wrong theregiment was evidently waiting for the grassoutters, who would bring the ropes and pegs to enable it to picket the horses." The discrepancy between these two accounts is so remarkable that General Jaoob may well blush at his "gross mistake !" Having shown that the Bengal army is faultless, Colonel Phipps is next good enough to ccount for its mutiny in the following manner:- "It is true that regiments badly commanded have mutinied, but this does not oceur in native regiments alone, and I could name more than one of Her Maestys regiments which have done the same." Now, what is the present state of this perfect army? It appears from the last letter of your able Bombay correspondent, that out of 74 infantry regiments five only are now armed und free from acts of mutiny; that all the ten regiments of cavalry have either mutinied or been disarmed, and that out of 15 irregular regiments nine have either mutinied or deserted to the enemy. Aocording to Colonel Phipps, these regiments have only mutinied because badly commanded, a misfortune which might happen to any of Her Majesty's regiments I Truly he Is a bold man I He dares to utter that which Cardinal Wiseman, were he as unpatriotic as you depicted him, would blush to have thought l He daes to justify the Sepoys at the expense of their officers I He dares to excuse those fiends who have slain their confiding commanders, who have violated women before the eyes of their husbands and fathers, who have considered simple death too easy an end for innocent babes, who have committed atrocities which the mind can hardly conceive and the mouth refuses to speak I He dares to lay the blame of the mutiny on these murdered officers I He daes to call himqelf the comrade of those he has so groBly slandered I He daes to compare the soldiers of England with the perpetrators of these crimes I Does he dare to call himself an Englishman ? I remain, your obedient servant. Q.

THZ ARfY. (From the Gloue) Rerutiting for the army has be/s for job* weeks going so very satisfactorily on the wh2ole. For e artillery, fer In stanoe, we are now getting about 700 a mouth, butts rgrds the lins-both cavalry and In"try-although large nuber Are coming in, we sbould milead ere'we to my that; the rate is elcalated to meet ala our wantg. It mUA beo borne in min4 that we have decrecsed our home and colonial establishmeLt by seven regiments of cavAlry and About 325 battalions of infantry, which must be rep.aeed, and that wet cannot have less thanabott 11,000men as a nucleus for reinforcements to the 54 Queen's regiments now in Indis, or on; thdirpassge to thatoountry. This in heavy demand, aud onDf that must be met by more than the ordinory means of obtaincg men Suggestions of all kinds ans to what xhapeo those extraordinary steps should assume have boen freelymade, and, we believe, fairly listened to. A volanteer corps for the middle slases-a kind of high caste regiment-has been pressed upon public attention, and all manner of plans for expediting recruiting are named every day. Our business, however, is rather with what is actually being done tban what is "under consideation." It is stated that the plan of giving a oommnlsion under crtain conditions to a young gentleman bringing lOO recrult3k has been suddenly abandoned. The satement is incorrect,* The fact is, that after the first notification so many yoqnj men presented themselves that it became neoesry to ceeck. the pres6nre a little until some practioal proof should beogiven of the success of the experimnent. There are & goodo many young gentlemen now at work endeavouring to. raisetheir men under the authority of Governnment, but as yet. no one has reported his contingent" assembebled andif lterapplications are put aside for the present, It is In oden that. the chances of the first applicants and the recruiting sergeauta should not be destroy ed by such universal competition for men. In the m eantime, we believe it is probable thataaother.- experiment will be tried, by which any offioer 'who has held the rank of field officer, mnbgtntive major at the least i=. Her Majesty's service, on his raising 1,000 men Will be'Appointed to command them as a battalion, with the rank of Ii.uteant.colonel. He will also have the power of nominating, under the approval of the General &ommanding4in.- Chief, tho 10 ensigns of his corps, and will be allowed the} regular bounty for each recruit that he procures We shall watch the result of this experiment with mnuch interest; but whether it succeed perf etly or not we cannot but thInk there is an appearance of promise about it that makes the trial commendable. The rettriction of the recrutifng to A particular battalion will probablT make it interfere less with. the regular recruiting staffthan if men were to be enUlls fndiscriminately, in competition With that body. It~ will, besides, if Success= , help us along with our second battalionS, of which only four are as yet in. a state of even partial existence. When we have complete4 the remaining l ordered to be raised, we may then pauses a little to see if more be negessay. There mnst also be a substantial addition to our force or cavalry. We have sent or are sending to India seven r- ments-the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 7th Dragoon Guards, th i and 8th Hussa", and the 17th Laneors; but this does not. represent the extent zo which we have thereby weakened our home force; for each of the 12 line cavalry regimente. remaining in the UInited Kingdom have given volunteers tcmake those going out equal to the Indian egtablishment. They have thus reduced themselves to an average strength, 'we should say, verygittle exceeding 200 sabres eachregiment When the Sth and 17th shallhave embarkednext week therewill be but four cavalry regiments in Ireland; and theaffair at Belfast shows that, even as rzgards internal arrangements, we should allow no feeling of secuity to snake us forgetful of such contingencies and of the disastrous. consequeRces which are so frequently prevented by the presence of a compact body of the military. We mar anticipate, therefore, tl'st an immediate addition of twroF troops per regiment will be made to the 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards, the 1st, 2d, and 6th Dragoons, the 3d, 4th, and 13th Light Dragoons, the 10th, Uth, and 15th Hassars, and the 16th Lancers. This will make c-ch of those regiments ooDsiEt of eight troops-the strength at which they stood at the close of the Crimean war, and fromx which, we believe, they were reduced with some reluctaunce The aggregate increase will give us 24 additional troops of cavaly hut as 42 troops have been taken from the regular home establishment by the subtraction of seven regIments for India, after a little time it will be necessary to make further additions to supply the deficiency. We presume some more regiments will be raised, and for ourselves we confess we should rejoice to see the gap in the Army Lisl filled up by the reconstraction of the 5th Roral Irish Dragoons. This regiment was disbanded for disaffection some 50 or 60 years since, and since then there has bsn no 5th Regiment of Dragoons in the British army. There is assuredly no reason of the kInd against their being again called into existence. The "Irish Sepoyism," which has been thought worthy of mention by some of our contemporaries, will never require a larger military force than a couple of assistant surgeons; and those fine strapping fellows, the Irish constabulary, say they only want an Irish national corps in which to prove their heroism. Why not give them another chance by allowing them to form from. their own ranks a new " 5th Royal Irish Dragoons ! " We have spoken of some of the agementa at the present moment in progress for meeting the requirements of the public service. When Parliament meets the Govern. ment must be prepared to show that they have done every. thing in their power to provide troops for the re-establish. ment of British dominion in the East. The public will require to know that every availablo regiment has been sent from a station where its presence may not be absolutely necessary to that wbere it is imperatively required, that the best officers have been sent to command them, that the ena terprise, pluck, and sinew of the nation have beer turned toa good account in replacing and reinforcing them, that its nformation and intelligence have been utilized by the fair tril of all useful practicable suggestions, ;rrespective of red tape and officialism. Judging from the measures already adopted, with 'which the public are acquainted, and from those in course of adoption, some of which we now describe, we have little doubt that the energy and large views which inspire the work of the recess will enable Ministers to re. gard with equanimity the criticism of the sessIon.
I TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me to suggest, through your wlide-spread colmuns, a plan which has just occurred to my mind. There will be, doubtless, many poor desti. tute orphans of our soldiers in Indt retorned to our shores shortly. There is an asylum at Hamp. stead, founded expressly for the reeeption of the orphans of our soldiers and sailors who perished in the Crimean cam. paign; by enlarging the building, and by the additional subscriptions aud donations of the charitable-which I am sure would flow in from all quarters-many poor orphans would find refuge in this noble establishment at a trifling outlay. As a governor and annul subscriber I should be jmost happy-aind so, no dout, would many more-to double n,y subscription to effect so excellent an object. Our soldiers in India have displayed so much heroism and self-devotion, that the least wre " who sit at home at ease" can do for their helpless little ones is to provide comfortably for them, and to educate them so as to fit them to earn their own livelihood at a proper age. God forbld that the orphans of those brave men who perished so nobly im the cause of their country should be left to the cold charity of a workhouse. CLERICUS CANTUARIENSIS. Sept. 23.

The failure was announced to-day of the Bank of -Weer. Ranrison, Watson, and Co. at HulL It 'was a very old establishment, and until lately enJoyed high credit. The amount of liabilities ha not transpired, but it is supposed to be large. The bank, at one time issued notes, but it had ceased to do so for many year The Btoppage is supposed to bave.been caused by imprudent advance3 to a local undertaking, called the HullF Flax ancd Cotton Mill Company. l AThe £ast&-n Counties herald annonmees the winding up oi the Hull Flax arkd Cotton Mills Com@ ny. This undertaking was founded in the year 1836 with a capital of 100,0001., which was ubse.-uvntly increased by the iSue of new shares to Z37,U001., tart of which remains to be called up. At one period the company paid a dividend of 12i per cent. Nothing is known of the amount of liabilities, but it is believed the debt on debenture and banking account is 280,000l.; while 360,0001, has been expended on building and machinery. The 1001. uhares, wiAch were at one time worth 2501., f Ahave beenA ofered with a bonus of 201. to take all lazbility. A communication was inserted yesterday from Coloniel Decluzeau calling in question the authenticity of the announcement by the last India mail of a mut-iny having broken out among the Bombay troops at Dharwar, the date of the information being- the 9th of August, while, according to Colonpl Decluzeau, it is known that the commander at that station had telegraphed to Bombay that all was quiet there on the 12th of that month. Subjoinedt, however, is a copy of the 1tter from the officer at Bellary, in the Madras Presidency, on 'which the statement was founded, and which seems to prove that, although, through the adoption of vigorQus measres, everything may have been quiet at Dharwar on the 12th of August, an outbreak -must have occurred or been threatened a few days previously Belmary, Aug. `Telegra)p just recelved.

Only theri&htwiDggOOS. Themutny is at Dharwar." In connexion with this subject another correspondent conlirms the fact of some critical demonstrations having taken place. He has property at Dhnrvar, and his letters by the hast mail state that great excitement prevailed, and that the European residents had applied to Government for arms and anrrmuhition, and were keeping their horses saddled in preparation for any emergency. Tho following relates to the Great Western Railvay.: "Sir,-Your CityU Article'of Friday last (September 18), as well as several former otes on the mme subject, has made a mistake, which for the iuterest of the shareholders, it is desirable you shonid correct. " You state that four shareholders were associated by the BHistol meeting of August with the directors for purposes of consultation and the like. Now, I have seen the official report of the proceedings onx that occasion, and I find no such appointment. It is trule that a committee of investiga. tion wasV proposed, and negatived on the hoard undertaking to make arrangements for the introductton of' a certain number of newv members on. the direction; but, so far as I am aware, nothing has yet been done, nor is likely to be 2One, sO long ns the normal Influences of Paddington remain nndlsturbed. While on this sulject pormit me to call your attention to the 5,0001 grant to Mr. Saunders without previous notice to the snareholder6, without any mention in the report, 'without any explanation of the principle on which the amount of the grant had been calculated, and without any Statement of the number and amount of previous grants which tnay have been already made, with or without the cognizance of the shareholders, to that gentleman. 4 You may advert also to the rumour, and, I believe, to the fact, tbat this extraordinary sum of 5,0001. was actually paid to Mr. Saunders in April or May la.t, without any vote of the shareholders and vithout any special mention by the auditors for the half-year endinR June 30, 1857. 44 Yours obdiently, z. The writer of this note is wrong in supposing there has been any mistake on the matter as far as The fTimes is concerned. The Great Western directors may have committed the mistake, if that is the proper term in such a case, of breaking the promise made at the last meeting by which they induced runny persona to give them their votes; hut, even in thbe face of what is dai3y witnessed in the managesnent of public companies, it would have been. disagreeable to assume the possibility of such a circumsxtance.

It is added that even if the aubmarine cable is not laid down between Cagliari and Malta, the Admiral at the latter port can conmmunicate the Indian news to the British Government by sending a despatch boat to Reggio, in the Straits of Messina, where the electric wires are in communication with Naples; so that the British Vice-Consul at Reggio eould transmit the despatch to the Consul at Naples, who could send it on at once to Lord Clarendon, by which means some hours would be saved.

The 45 miles. y6t'o o-be opened pas through a 'fin 'district for traffig. The prodeoe and trafflc obthined over4hoee 45 mfles WiiM feed the remainder of the line, and yield from 54 to 100 per 'cent. more revenue per ton of-produo thin tIe line uast of. Paris. When the liue shal hare baee ope'n three year there issno doubt that 10 miles of the 160 Will h s goode on ths average mile per mile, as the 47 miles of thte Great veetern are now between Pars and London. Of the raold growth of local busine. some Idea may be fkrmea fronm the circumstanoo that the local freight ot tio Great Weitzr, was 3i times as large In the fifth half-year as in their first year. The ferry landings aDd wharves the cainal bridges, and the ferryboat are now being vigorously prosecuted, for it was of the blghest importance that they be put in oeiatlon before' their prtsenf accesasto Buffalo iarboux ia osed wihice. Wit egd t I Goderlch and the through Lake trade, he Spent oneclay iu examining thit harbour'and the posiiible upp±oa6he I, )t, ,nd states that, with proper care, the raUlway can be t ken down to the harbour at a moderate expense, and. with a fair workable grade; the extra length to the towm is two miles. The harbour itself is capable of beitng ade a safe and easy one to enter; well land-locked, quiet, atd commodhous; a inoderate outlay will provide a good quay 700 yards long, lengthen the pler, clear off the tar, auid give .uticient deer water for five or six large steamboats and a 'ew dozen igraft. This done, a Godech whichi ls now about the hLlf-wal point between'Btffalo op the' one handt and Chivg and Mlwauklie on the other) brought wlthn sbix hours of Buflo, we cannot conceive what is to prevent a very large summer ' and Autumn traffic. The harbour acommodation can - be expanded it needed for a very large business The progress of the works betweei Stratford and Goderich has been delayed by the very frequent rains of this summer; with moderatly goocl weather thls section will be opened to the town of Goderich by the 1st of January, in whioh case it will be in time to carry a considerable part of this year's harvest in that distriet. The approach to Goderich harbour, and the improvement of it, wil 'not be commenced until the conclusion of terms of purchase with the Canada Company. 'The workshops at Brantford, the machinery fnd tools for repairlo rolling stock, re ample for the probAble wants of 'he com. pany for some years to come. The Chairman expresses bis confidence in the soundnes of Captain Barlow's general poliy, and in the honour, vigour, and vigilance of h-s admnistration of the compsany's affairs. In conclusion, the report. states that the piSt few months have beet( a period of extraordinary local stagnation, and that It is but rIg2t to lock to futurle seasons, rather than the one now clfotsng, for any fair'romis or measure of the capabilities of the line. ~ ~ o to apbiite TRAC RETUBRNS.

THE ROBBER.3 0o THZ NORAHEBNRBAILWA Y I_- -.-. - . . .AOPZFRA3aoB. The Court of Auize yesterday commenoed the trial bt -Carpentier, Grellet, Guerin, and Parod for the extenidve rob. :uobberiosof the Northern of France Railway, amounting to 'abont 6,0 0,f000.Thocourt wasnot by anyzndeandoverc,owdeO rbut amonR the persons ptesent were the Baron James .de Rothschild, the Marquis DAlon, IL Hottinguer, and if Delebocqus, directors of the Northeru lailwaY. Whetbhe prsoners were placed at the bar the greatest curirosity wa hlaifeted to see them, Carpentler is tall, and of gentle. ira14iY appearance; Grellet is short and thick-set, his features are highly coloured; Guerin, who is an elderly mu) had the appecaraotan bearin of ^ peasat in holyda clothses,; Parod, who Is of good hsig1 -, has bLak hair Lad whiskers. In answer to the usual prelhmunay questioni, Qarpentler said that he -was 26 yeLar of age, and w~s formerl principal cahier of the Northern Railway C-omPanKr ereUet said he was 31, and -was formerly sanb.ashear of tprmoid cQmpao n; Guerin, that he was t6, and frmr heowas 3i,formeorlyamedc student, but Uatterly ahorse dealr.. The list of witnse was then caled over, 35 being for the prosnetion and 18 for the prisner Parod. The indiotinent, which was of grt length, set forth these fact: -Carpenticr andGreletenteredtheseice of the Northern ralway Comfapn when It wa first formed. They woie then very you n,ut by attention ad intelligenoe they attraJe& the notice of their chiefs, and the former wae, after a -while, appointed sub-ashier, Land In 18f cashier. The latter, -after being hief clerk of the offioe of the depost of hshres, was made suboasaier, ty remaining at the head of that offie 0 the 26th of August, only aome mouths after hs promotioe to the cahlership, C£ btier obtained from oane of the-directorsleaveof absencerorafewdays, onL the. btet that he was abont to mharry. The day after Gral- 1esaid to an emplcy6 that Carpentler, insteia of go'n tho y-onig lady to whom be was engaged, d gone . tdTe-ouie with a young woman nmed Georget, whom he tiAd for- some time kept; and that as the knowedg fo i3bie fact would damage him in the opb on of th yeyung lady's raxents, he (GreUet) would go to Tru-. ,.tbrnng him backa - ne therefore stated that he hould net matothe office ie next dy, and he begade the enipIosr t a"Y. in the event of any rthe dirto asking after him, thIt he h gone to the Bank of Franco on buatmess. No attentioa was excited by the abeenQe of the two mnen tillthe st of Sep tember, when Carpentier's fattier, to whom,the extplylod spoken of his son's departure for Trouvill, and who had gonel down to that plco after him bthAd not found either him or Grehl et, or the yonng womae 18orget, waited onr one of the directors to say thas borh his son and Grellet ha disappeoaed. On this the dlzeltor, whao was the Marquis DaLon, made a hasty examzdina tion of their ccouints, and found them apparently tfrotly r'sgular h he also found that 30,000 shares belon lu toW'iroi'de, Rothschild, and which had been Grl in a safein GreUe. rooba, wer apparentlntact, we daye after,.when'neadtherett nor Greet h e i cpm pMaranee; a more hing thestlgat w m and rowbelan frauds to an s s ame of n ee od bn covere .w It hew ascertaine i tha t tho ha behn very intimatd with Parod, who was an old schoolfelow and townsman of Grmeyet; and that in conjunction wmth him they had speculated largely on the Bours ever since 15, their opertions at fist being successfuLd and afteirards thes reverse. It was subsequently discovered that on the 27th Carpentier had sailed from Havre for New Yorh ad had written to Grheot to tfll him him so; that Gret t had3 gone to Liverpoo and had peed thnce fo tme same destination; and that Pared, with awoman named FeUacin Dbut, with whom he had lived for sme time, and by, whom he had had two chidren, had also fled from Paris to lAvervp , and had saled in the &sme voel with GreSet for NowYork. La tly, it app ted hat about the same time Guerin, who had been in te service of the railway company - *firt as watchman of the baggage, and next as 5,05 manof the eash-ofn hke t a salary of only ha e ., br t w had left the company in October, giving out that he had Linherite a fortune, and who bad purcha&Ad land, hait housev, and made loas of money-it appeared that tdsh man had goene to Bruasels and thence to London, where he wa staying in s false nLame. As the frauds and robberies had Wenossommitted in the office which ho had to watchi, It was sppeeo that he miust have been concerned in them, and sl September he was arreted at London, The other three were not captured in America until soen,time afterwards. The indictment then went on to specif the robberle ahid frauis oommitted. It said that though the 80,000 sharest-of Baron de Rothschild had appeared to be tutoeched, yet on a close examination it turned out that 5,065 of them had been taken away, and had been replaced by 5,065 others removed froma the .leposits of other share. holdem The safe ia which they had been deposited had been forod open, anxi, as Grellht and Carpentier could open It with keys, it was almost certain that the extraction lamu have been made by Guerin, unnlown to them. In the celars of the company were other safes, in which wtre oeposited shxres belonging to different 5holder, and these safes were fastened with three looks, two of the kes of which wern held by carpentier and Grellet, the thirdrly p director, Yet these safes hat been ofe1,1 and 240 sha.res belonging to the Marquis de Lentill hAcla been takcen from the envelopes in which they had been placed; 34 other envelopes, oonta mgbes belonng to 12 different persoins, nextlo bee o pened,= and 5,512 shares had been absracd from them. Oif theee 5,512 5,065 had been placed in the collection of Baronlothsceild. There Tonsquentlyremanted. 447, which, addede to the 240 of the Marquis de Lentolhat, mnade 687; and, onse uently this total added to -the baron' 5,06, mad 5,75. TII& vaist robbery was not the only one comnnitted; 1000 bond,s oG 500., numbered from 384,001 to 385,000, had been71absracted from the counter. foil-registers which contained them. Some time after it was ascertained that the acunts, though aparsetly perfectly regular, presented a deficit of 1,0166,; s3 52c., consistingfirstof a sum of 900,000fL, which had been falsely inscri ashavln been id into the, Bank of Frane2, ; and next one of 266,0f., fa ly sribed as having been paid to the accountants of the company-. The indictment then proceeded to relate the circumstances of the arrest of the four prisonert Mand said that Carpentier was found in possesdson of a sum of 108,720f.; Greauet of 22,901f.; and Pared of 55;90f.7in all, 187ordfer in addition to which there is reastlot vethey iane, jointly or separately, sereted part of their bsoty. As to Guerin, when arrested, he d pe oed various houses at Paris, or in the environs, estimated at 310, 00 0f. ; securmities for loans made by him to the amount of 142,'000f.; 1,415 coupoas of shares Lof the Northern Railway ; an acknow. ledginent of 160,00O0f. for goods sent to Valparalcso; and, lastly, when he fled from Paris to Belgim he carried with him 60,0f. in notes of the Bank of France. The indictment nextrwent o to say that Carpentier and Greilet had confesed to the robberies and frauds and had staoted that.they bad made them In order to raise funds to meet losses incured at the Bour with Paroed, with, however, the intentionofs rnaking restitution,in the event of thhe seltions being sucessaul As to Guerin, it appeared tbehave had speculated on his own aecount, and that in 1854, 1855, and 185r his operation amounted to the enormaous sum of 43,t00,0orf.

THE GUARDS AND THE MEDJIDIZ. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. 'Sir,-The Guards have an injudicious chAmpion In Colonel James Lindsay. The gallant Colonel is angry that a corm parison should have been drawn by your correspondent "Nemo" between the services of the Brigade of Guards and thoso of the Light Division. He declares that the Guards remained on the heights before Sebastopol throughout the war, "with one slight exception." But that exoeption consisted in their baing released from the most trying duties to which British troops were ever exposed during the spring of 1855, from February till June. The Light Division, which had suffered so terribly at the Alma, were not thus indulged. They were kept at their post without any remission from the commencement of the siege until those fatal days when, weak with raw recruits and boy offlcers, they were finally shattered against the Redan, the Guards on these occasions being " in reserve." Dnring the winter of 154-5 their depOts at home feebly attempted to repair the wide gaps occasioned in their ranks by disease, shot, bad food, overwork, and exposure; but they could send out to them little more than " gristie," to use Lord Hardinge's expressive phrase, whtle the Guarde, having four battalions at home and but three on foreign service, were easily able to repair their losses with well trained and picked recruits, and well instructed offlcers. In the trenches during the siege the captains of the Light Division were on duty one night in three, sometimes oftener; whereas the captains of the Guards, ranking as lieutenant-colonels in the army, went in, as lientenantcolonels, but about once a fortnight. The officers of the Light Division came home during the war only when badly wounded or seriously ill. The officers of the Guards -were constantly coming home in perfect health, en promotI on into one of the battalions in England. All these things ought to be taken into considozation in comparing fairly-as Colonel Jame3 Lindsay propores to do -the services of the two corps and their claiums to distinction and rewards. The Guards fought in the Qimea, as they have-always done, as bravely as any other regiments ia Her Majesty's foroes; but we have Major Eiwmuel Calthorpe's-opinion-the opinion of a Staff office,-at head-quar! ters-that they contained among them the greaes grumbler, in the army, and that they were sadly dafcieat in that patient endurance and hardihood under prios. which no nobly characterized -their more fortunate hrotlren of tha. Line." If Colonel.James.Linday is desirous oE breaking a 2ues with anybody on behalf of the Gusrds !te. ought to. deal wiWtMhaMjor Ciltkorpe's assertions, whib liave gone un. challenged through two editions, befo;,e he falls foul so. angrily of poor " Nemo" for standing ixs4ar his frisnds and comrades in the Light Division.

LONDON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBZR 25, 1857. The meetings of Sovereign Princes are nowv but commonplace things. In old times the portentous conjunction of two great Potentates filled the world with forebodings of change and disaster; but now the facility of intercourse, the love of travelling, and the special activity and curiosity of two or three occupants of thrones have accustomed us to the sight of Royalty either unbnxding among its loyal subjects or fraternizing gracefuly with its august equals. The approaching interview between the Emperors of FBANuC and RuSSIA cannot be expected to excite among us any deep emotion. Indeed, the locomotion of Monarchs is pre-eminently one of the NAPoLEoNi&N ideas. GEORGE III. and Louis XVI. vegetated quietly enough ia their capitals or their almost suburban Windsor and V'ersailles. In those days one King seldom looked on the face of another, and though the whole race were related within no very distant degree of affinity, they seldom communicated, except when a piece of Sevres porcelain or a marriageable Princess was despatched from one capital to another. But the great CoNQuERoR liked to be his own Amba?sador as well as General, and even when there was no particular business to be done it was gratifying to be the centre of a crowvd of Kings, Electors, and Princes, all with favours to ask and flatteries to offer. Now such mcetinga have become habitual. and though the interview at Stuttgart may call up some memories of Ttlsit and its conferences of 50 years since, we' see in it more an act of mutual courtesy than the inauguration of a scheme of European policy. The Emperor of the PitzcH is, indeed, we think, wise in thus demonstrating openly his full reception into the brotherhood of European Sovereigns. The late CZAR inflicted on him five years ago a slight which was followed by a severe retribution. When the representative of the C.IESAits and the SovEmtmIao who fills the venerable throne of these kingdoms were content to address the new Monar-h as their equal, the arrogant despot of a half-civilized empire chose to withhold from him the usual expressions of courtesy. The insult was open and studied; it was intended to show to Europe that the chorus which hymned the greatness and power of the CZAR was justified in its praises, and that a Russian ruler could afford to treat cavalierly the head of the great military State of Western Europe. It is no small triumph that within a few years the sons of NICUOLks have come to pay their respects to the man who was not thought worthy to be styled the " brother" of a Russiau Emperor. If the throne of NAPoLEoN IIL rests on prestige and glory, there is certainly something in this StAttgart interview to give it a firmer support. With regard to Dolitical matters, there will be little done at the meeting, simply because there is little to do. Those who think that a conversation between two Sovereigns can decide the destinies of Europe have little notion of the change which has passed over the world since last a BoNAPARTE met a RoxwiorF. Then there w( re only Kings and Generals, now there are nations well acquainted with their own interests, there are an enliglhtened public opinion and a high moral code. No State is powerful enough to invade a neighbour's rights, or too weak to maintain its own. Prussia and Austria, whatever may be their jealousies, are united in upholding the independence of Central Europe, and the smaUer States of Germany are indisaolubly linkled with them by interest and the memory of past dangers. Belgium and Holland are prosperous, respectable, and respected. Sardinia has the sympathies of the world, and may fearlesaly continue in the corrse she has chosen. Never was the fabric of Europe more solid and well cemented than at the present time, when the progress of events and the spread of enlightenment have realized the long-detired balance of power. Therefore, without urging the character and repeated assurances of NAPorsoN, or the obvious interest3 of ALExmaDnru, we may dispel the fears of alarniists, if such there be, by pointing out that Europe is too strong to fear the alliance of any pair of Potentates. Nothing can be done except in accordance with the principles already accepted as public law. Then, too, the principal questioDs which have been lately ia dispute may now be considered as settled. The last subject connected with the East-the political arrangement of the Danubian provincesis underatood to be no longer amatter of contention. Each nation has fulfilled the Treaty of Paris, and seems inclined to abide by it. The question of Italy, the question of Spain and Mexico, need present no insuperable difficulties. The two Emperors, should they discuss the affiairs of Europe, will find as little field for pacification as there is opportunity for disturbance. But there is one point to which the two Sovereigns may turn their attention. Europe has at last, after the struggle of centuries, established the principle of national independence. It may be said to be now part of public law that no State* of our community, however poor, or perverse, or ill-behaved, shall be conquered or despoiled. The Turkish Empire and Sweden have just been solemnly guaranteed the integrity of their territory, and each of the great military States repudiates the notion of offensive war. Why, then, should the continent bristle with bayonets, and every city echo with the roll of drums and the challenge of sentinels ? Why should young men be torn by hundreds of thousands from the plough to pass years of military ioieness in barracks and camps, while women hoe the cabbage-ground or carry baskets of earth on their backs up the hill-side vineyards? If the French Empire means peace, if the Russiani Empire means railways and corn-crops, let the world have the benefit of the change. Where no one wishes to strike, there can be no need of this unchanging posture of defence. War itself is hardly a greater evil than such an exhausting preparation for it. The two Sovereigns who will meet in a few days at Stuttgart rile the nations which, in the opinion of the world, are th3 great obstacles to a general disarmament. Every one knows that Prussia and Austria are not aggressive Powers England, of course, desires not an inch of ground on the continent of Europe, and is prosperous in proportion to the peace and prosperity of the continent. It is France and Russia which by their armaments continually menace the quiet of Europe. We firmly believe that France in the preuent day has no appetite for conquest, and that her vast army is kept up in a great degree in deference to certain traditions of former days. But the French have nothing now to fear from AngloAustrian or Anglo-Russian coalitions, and half their enormous army might beat its swords into ploughshares with perfect safety. If NAPOLEON III. can promote a general disbanding of levies which are now unneeded for any good purpose, this jubilee of Tilsit will not have been held in vain.
The anomalous and painful struggle in India will not be exempt from the conditions which in aUl ages and countries have been imposed on warlike operations. The mutineers muwt either provide themselves -with a military chest or live on the resources of the country. If they attempt to make the war support itself, they must abandon the policy which they have hitherto adopted of cooping themselves up in fortified towns; and a system of plunder or of forced requisitions will outweigh with the rural population all sympathies of race or of religion. The predatory horsemen of the Mahrattas and of the Pindarees issued from districts of their own to ravage the neighbouring provinces ; but the Sepoys of Delhi, though they have placed a puppet King on the throne, are equally strangers and intruders in all parts of India. It is probably true that they have already robbed the traders of the Mahomedan metropolis; but their rule must be extended and con3olidated| before they can hope to raise any considerable revenue from the districts which they may possibly overrun. The capture of some provincial treasuries has involved serious loss to the Indian Government, but it has fortunately added nothing to the rebel resources. The murderous ruffians vwho have carried out the movement show in this and in all other instances that no religious or patriotic enthusiasm instigates or palliates their crimes. The representatives of a serious cause would have transferred to their new Sovereign the public money which had been collected to defray the expenses of administration. The mutinous Sepoys divided among themselves their il-gotten wealth -without making any provision for the inevitable cost of the war. It is not surprising that criminals s6 consistent in rapine as well as murder should attract the envy and admiration of the hungry adventurers who constitute the revolutionary rump in Ireland. Except in the large towns there are no hoards of wealth in Central India within the reach of military miraulders. The produce of the harvests is only sufficient for the wants of the population; and the land revenue can only be collected by a Government sufficiently permanenat to undertake the police and administration of the country. The taxpayers will probably take advantage of the crisis to withhold their contributions from the legitimate authorities; but they wiil assuredly not be precipitate to acknowledge by any tangible proof of faith the usurped authority of the eloouL. X. native cultivator wiU be proof against aU appeals to his patriotism; nor wil violence readily extort a payment which he hopes ultimately to refuse or to evade. The Customs' dues are fortunatelybsyond the reach of the mutineers. The native bankersmay be subjected to plunder; but theywiM steadilyrefuse any voluntary advances to customers who would in ! the event of a prosperous turn in their affairs be strong enough to set creditors at defiance. It is said, indeed, that eapitalists of this class are judiciously indemnifying themselves for their losses by issuing base money to the rebels, and by purchasing the produce of their crimes at the rates uully paidlfor stolen goods. The risings which may be feared in various districts may lead to the destruction of valuable property, but they will scarcely enrich the insurgents. The estats and factories of Behar contain little portable wealt%, although the community may be exposed to heavy suferings in the event of their capture. The portion of the hostils forces which remains at Delhi can add nothing to the common funds of themutiny. Tlhe treasures of the Palace must already be fast wasting away. The rebels may probably be able to supply themselves with food. The necessaries of life are cheap on the banks of the Ganges, and the Eindoos are a temperate race; but muskets, ammunition, horses, and beasts of carriage can only be provided by meas of a constaut outlay. Abova all, the troops, long accustomed to ample and regular pay, must be rewarded for their servies. The circumstances which preceded the outbreak are stil ea- veloped in mystery; but the mutiny must have been unaccountably inconsistent with all former precedent if the troops were not seduced and stimulated by promises of an improvement in their condition. It is known that many of them joined unrillingly in the revolt; nor has any brilliant succes since occurred to revive their hopes and to iprolong their patience. Tho less fortunate will Inot be the more readily satisfied because some of I their comrades may have enriched themselves by the plunder of the public treasuries. -No difficulty of a similar kind will interfere Iwith the operations of the Government. The utmost extent of financial inconvenience will arixe from the interruption in collecting the revenue of the disturbed districts. The credit of the Company is still unshaken, and it is known that it has the boundless resources of England to draw upon if any necessity should arise. The rebels have one great arsenal in their power; but they are drawing from a well which they have no means of replenishing when it becomes sooner or later exhausted. There is no limit short of the utmoat wanut of the public service to the stores and munitions of war at the disposal of the supreme Government. Armies have often tried to make a livelihood by their mere strength and numbers; but they have invariably failed, in default of finding a leader and paymaster. The free bands which infested France after the wars of EDWARD IIL and of the BLACK PRINCE Were compolled to take service under the French King. WALLENSTBrN was the indispensable centre of the warlike mercenaries whom he rallied round the Imperial standard. It is under the pressure of a similar necessity that the mutineers have proclaimed the King of DELHI, and that a considerable force followed the fortunes of NzNA ; but the money and jewels of the Mogul palace must by tlhis time have been expended, and the fortune of tLe Mahratta pretender is altogether inadequate to the oxpenses of a prolonged struggle. The revolt will inevitably fail from financial weakness alone if the mutineers continue to rely on their own unassisted resources. For this reason, it is doubly important to watch the movement, of the native chiefs and princes. The defection of _IOR might have been a more serious evil than the revolt of his Contingent, for the rebels would value revenue and territory much more than any numnber of armed accomplices. it is fortunate that the King of OUDn, who might have recovered the dominions which he so recently forfeited, is in safe custody at Calcutta. Even at present there is? no part of India in which the mutineers are so likely to establish themselves for a time asin Oude. The Sepoys Will naturally hope to fnd support in their own native recruiting ground. It is, however, a curious and significant circumstance that the soldiery which has proclaimed the Mogul Emperor has hitherto abstained from recognizing his rebellious vassal of Oude. T-he Princes of India are now on their trial, and if they are found faithful their position will be tecured for an indefinite period. They have it in their power to do much injury to the Supreme Government, and by the same act to entail inevitable ruin on themselves. The dominions of faithless allies and the pensions of treacherous dependents will be justly applied in relief of the charges which must neces.arily be occasioned by the war. Any territory which the mutineers may occupy through the connivance or incapacity of its rulers will be reconquered to the use of the Power which is able to protect it. It is of the utmost importance that the rebels should be prevented from sheltering themselves under the authority of any legitimate potentate. Those native Governments which prove themselves ready and able to fulfil their engagements will not fall to reap their reward, ana the present crisi will show wlhether it is desirable that the English Empire should be surrounded by feudatories and dependent allies. But the proverb which attributes victory to the longest purse indicates no accidental or inequitable condition of affairs. Wealth is on the side of prudence against rashness, of commercial nations against warlike hordes, and generally of civilization in its contest with barbarlsm. There is little doubt that English organization will outlast the impulses of Oriental violence.
More than one Drapers' Assistant is very angrry with us for suggesting that it would be a social advantage if his place behind the counter could be supplied by one or more women, and he himself transferred to some more manly avocation than holding up ribands to capricious fair ones, and assuring them that such a pattern is exactly his own taste. The effect which such pursuits have upon their votary is evidenced in the letters which have been addressed to a contemporary on the subject, and which breathe all the spirit of a JmN,-xrxs or a JEAmEs. Why should " a respectably connected young man" leave his comfortable situation for the society of " navvies, " labourers, and worse?" Why should he exchange his tail coat and stiff white cravat for " a "suit of red and blue bai-e ?"-which we learn on the authority of the trade is the substance with which ElER u AAIsTy's troops are clothed. If, indeed, a regiment were embodied in which he might associate with his equals, the case would be different; but while the army is still vulgar and plebeian he will remain at home, keep his hands soft, and scornfully reject " two pounds "and an outfit." Much is, we suppose, the general view of the profession with regard to the advice we presumed to give. It only shows how a bad system may dlegrade those who are subject to it. Whatever a " respectable young man," who smirks behind a Regent-street counter, may think or write, we maintain-and the common sense of the country will bear us out in it-that the showing and selling of women's dress to women is essentially a woman's occupation, and, that the habit of employing men, whether it arise from the caprice of the customers or the calculation of the shopkeeper, is inconsistent with the dignity of the person who thus devotes himnself to an unsuitable occupation. That this is not felt to be the case by the parties concerned only proves how much use may blunt the sensibilities. Many a man who would shnrink from makingbeds, lkeaforeign hotel waiter, yet spendahis life in an essentiaUy feminine occupation, without a thought that there is anything undignified in the practice. But we shall, of course, be met by the argument that men are proved to be fittest for the occupation by the fact that employers ame willing to pay them more than vould be paid to women. Why should a draper, it is said, pay 501. a-year to a man when he can get a woman for 251., if it were not that a man does more work and better work? Well, let it be granted that on account of the long hours of labour, the infliction of a large amount of porters' work on the shopmen, and the severity of the regulations, which forbid them in some cases, we believe, to sit down lest the establishment should seem to laclk businessthe strength of women would prove unequal to the task-what then is proved? Simply that men having been first employed in days when " man-milliners" and ladies' tailors pursued their craft, the custom has lingered to our own time, and masters have made use of it to get a larger quanity of work out of their servants than is necessitated by the nature of the occupation. There might in a better state of things be men employed to put up shutters and to lift down bales, while women performed the lighter duty of discussing the merits of material and iMluencing the choice of customers. |And to descend from theory to fac4x thix is the course wbich is being adopted, both across the Channel and aeross the Atlantie, in establishments far larger than any which this capital posseMes. The great number of the women who have to support themselves and the extended education which they now receive have caused them to press into various occupations which formerly were in the hands of men. As is notorious to every one, the Parsian shops are mainly served by women, and thd practice is extending both in that city and others. Yet in every country the same law must hold good as in England, and man's labour be more efficient than a woman's. The fact is that the employment of men, which is universal in London and nowhere else, is the result of a bad habit and not of any necessary economical law. By a little change of sytem, by a division of labour, a bstt3r construction of the shops, and a more Idndly spirit on the part of employers and customers, the labour of thousands of women could be utilized without any destruction of their health or degradation of their position. And this in a country where, from emigration and other causes, women are in a large majority, would, we presume, be no slight gain. The respectable employment of women is one of the greatest questions of the present day, and society will do well to discountenanoe any bad, stupid, and indecent cutom which keeps them from what would be a most fitting occupation. The " respectable young men" who serve in drapers' shops may have their own, notions of dignity, but for our part we would far rather see any son of ours wielding the saw or the trowel, or even standing side by side with nav-ies on parade, than mincing and bowing and rubbing his hands to " carriage people " during the best days of an effeminate life.

The train, which consisted of engine and break van, second-olass carriage, composite carriage, first-class carriage, and break, passed Tumford station at about the right time, and had proceeded nearly two miles further, whenin rnning over the viaduct whioh crosses theNewark and Toiford road something gave way,-it is supposed an axle,-the engine became detached from the carriages and bounded forward while the vehicles separated into two divisions, the first of which, comprising a second-class and composite carziage, heeled over the embankment on the south side of the vinduct, while the hinder portion of the train, after striking against the buttress of the bridge on the north sido and breaking off tho stone cap and upper brickwork, fell down with a tremendous crash on to the turnpike road below, The first two vehicles made a complete somGrsault and alighted with tho right side up in a cottager's garden, one or two of the pasSengers were nuch injured, but the majority escaped,andthe carriages were verylittle damaged. The other three vehicles, including the break vLn, wee literaly nmashed to pieces, all the upper Vimbers being entirely stripped off the platforms, while the break van had fallen upside down, and the wood work was crushed almost flat on the ground. Such assistance as was at hand was rendersd as promptly as possible, and messengers were despatched to the nearest stations and to the nearest medioal men. Four of the paisengers werz taken out of the debris quite dead; three others vwere so seriously wounded as to be scarcely fit to be removed, and all the rest of the unfortunate travellers in this section of the train were more or leas severely injured. The dead bodies and one or two of the worst sufferers surviving were removed to the Newcastle Arms, Tuxford. The remainder of the patients were taken to Retford. The following is a list of the casualties :-Killed-The l[on. W. AL Windsor Clive, brother to the Hon. Robert Clive, M.P., wTho was also ia the train; Miss Letitia Paget, Gorton Lodge, Garston, Liverpool; Mrs. Heaton, 18, Queen-square, Lancaster; Mr Pitman, wife of one of the Great Northern Railway Company's officers, who sat next to her when in the train. WoundedCaptain Marshall, who was going to 203, Bath-buildings, Glossop-road, London, one eye knooked out, his wife and child escaped wlth bruises; Mr. John Dansfield, hatter, Waterhead-mill, near Oldham, one of the town-council of that borough, fractured ribs and internal injuries-bad case; John Jackson Bourn, near Cambridge, oompound fracture of nigt arm, internal injuries, not expectedto recover; William Dyson,the guard of the train, fractared skulljnternal injuries not expected to recover; Mr. Sworder, Hertford, fracture of ancle; Mr. Charles Sworder and Miss Sworder, slightly injured; Mr. and Mrs. Peace, Sheffield, contused wounds on the head; Mr. Joseph Hangus, Castle-street, Sheffield, cut and braised, returned home; Richardson, servant to Mr. William Wingham, of Hitchin, slightly ininred; Mr. Wingham was in the train and was seen walking on the line after the accident, but he has not been heard of since; Mr. Braithwaite Rayner, commercial traveller, irternally injured; Mr. James Smith, traveller, hoed hurt a good deal, but not seriously; Miss Marr, daughter of Mr. John Marr, 18, Queen-square, Lancaster, slightly injured; she was travelling with Miss Paget and Mrs. Heaton, one of whom was her aunt, and both of whom were killed. The head of one of the ladies killed was crushed quite Slat; the face of another was cut in two from top to bottom. A gentleman's boot, wet with blood, was seen on the road, as it had been cut off. A newspaper, smeared with blood, was aLso found. Numerous articles belonging to the paSSeDgers were picked up, and forwarded to Retford. The officials of the line, acting under Mr. Leith, superiatendent, were incessant in their exertions to mitigate the sufferings of the passongers ; the line which was broken up for a distance of about 50 yards was repaired within four hours after the accident by a staff of men under Mr. Sturrock. There have been several accidents between Tuxford and Newark, the last of which occurred during the flood about two months a%,o, but this is the first fatal pasenger accident that baa ever occurroe on thls line.
Two private lettes from Calcutta, dated the 8th of August, state that 500 French troops had arrived in the Emilie at the same time ns the Shannon. We presume these French troops have come from China to defend French interests at Chandernagore. StATo oP Dn.

SE7OND EDITION. THE TIMBS-OFFIJ,z Friday Hominy. EXPRESS FROM PARIS; The following is the letter of our Paris corm apondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 pm.:- An interview is fixed to take place at Weimsr on the lst of October between the Emperors,of Ruus and of Austria. The bare fact is all that' I am to-day able to communicate to you. The a nnouncement, when made, will cause some surprise here, especially to those perMons who for some time past have baen expatiating on the iaolation of Austria. Since the meeting at Stuttgardt was first talked of there have been reports in Paris of interviews, probable or posBible, between various Potentates, but I do not remember that rumour brought together the two £overeigns who are to meet in Saxony on the 1.t of next month. The Em.peror Francia-iJowh 'ill leave Pabrendorf-the cavalry manceuve at which place are to be attended by a number of persons of high distinetion-on the 28th inst. for Vienna, and from that capital will proceed to Weimar, The negotiations for the interview must have been conducted with great secrecy for nothing to have transpired until it was actually fixed, and only one week before the date appointed for its occurrence. The Emperor Napoleon, who was warmly received at Luneville, left this morning for Strasburg, where he was to arrive at 3 this afternoon. e Hwill bskfest to-morrow at Baden, on his way to Stuttgardt. Count Walewsi left to-dayto join him. He was to have gone yesterday but has been very unwell, and, moreover, was waiting for despatches from Vienna. The King of Denmark hams sent him the Grand Cros of the Order of the Elephant. It is believed that the Count has been a warn supporter of the view which the French Government has definitively adopted with respect to the question of tfie Duchies-a view favourable to Denrmark, and in which it is here thought that the English Government coincides. The funeral of x. Manin took place at noon today. More than 1,500 persons followed his coritL to the Montmartre cemetery. The pall-bearers were General URa; ML Pinchel, formerly Finance Minister of the Venetian Republic; M. Degl!Antoni, one of Manin's oldest friends; and Ary Scheffer, the distinguished paiater. Among the followers were General Dembinski, M. Montanell, a number of It,lian and, Hungarian refugees, x. Legouvd, of the French Academy; MI. Levasseur, who was ConsUl of France atVenice during ManWn's Government ; and a great many literary men and jouinalists, French and foreign. The corpse was placed in the family van7t of Ary Scheffer, where the remains of Mani' daughter aheady repose. Although Main rwas not a large man, the niche of the vault in which his coffin was to be placed was foand to be too narrow, and the masons had to enlarge it, which took nearly an hour, during which the cortege waited in the neighbourhood of the tomb. Everything passed off quite quietly. Certain precautions had been taken by the police, and M Manin, the son of the deceased, was warned that no speech must be made, and that his presence in Paris would be no longer permitted if this order were disobeyed. It was, of course, duly observed. The feeling of regret for the untimely death of Daniel Manin is very general here, not only amongst those who share his opin.ons and admire his political life, but L-nongst all who enjoyed his acquaintance, and had had oppoI Lunities of appreciating his many excellent qualities, his amiable character, his ageeable and intellectual conversation, and the cheerfulness and eignity with which he supported his reverse, and exile, e was 53 years of age. I subjoin, from a Paris paper, a brief sketch of bis career, although it contains little but what is very generally knownv- "*M. hXnin waa born at Venice in 18o0 He reedvoi his education at the University of Padua, and obtained his doctor's degree at the age of 17. In 1830 he becsme an advocate at Venice, and soon attained a high reputation, which bronght him into intimate contact with al the em;. nent men in Venice belonging to the Liberal party. In 184S he played a prominent part in the political events of his country. Having been imprisoned previously to the outbreak of that year, he was liberated by the trinmph of the popular cause, and he became the Dictator, anud then the President of the Venetian Republic. Onthe27th of August, 1849, he was forced to resign, and to seek for safety ir; exile. Ee then came to Paris with his daughter and 40 of his most dovoted followers. The remaining years of his life were principally passed in collecting documents relating to the present history of Italy. The body of hianin was emabalmed yesterday, andhi. Ary Scheffer, although seriously indisposed, took his likeness after death. The same eminent artist had painted the portrait of Manin's daughter, who has now been dead some years. M. Thiers also was an intimate fiiend of the deceased." A transport is being prepared for sea, which, it is said, is to convey to Pondicherry a battalion of Marines as a reinforcement to the garrison. The missing corvette Durance has turned up in the China seas. A letter from the Black Sea announces that the Russians have completed the folxifications of Yeni- KCing Jerome has established himself at the Palais Royal, as more convenient than Meudon for the fulfilment of his temporary duties as President of the Council of Ministers. It is reported this afternoon that the Prince of Pi essia and the Grand Duke of Hesre will go to Keol to greet the Emperor on his passage through that place. The meeting of Napoleon IIL and Alexander IT., which takes place to-morrow, naturally briogs tomind the Fist interview between their iricles, Napoleon I. and Alexander I., at Tilsit, in 1807. There are not, however, many points of similarity in the circumstances of the meetiugs, and certainly there is no reason to believe that their objects are in any degree identical, except in sofar as the visittoStuttgardt may tend to increase the cordial understanding be. tween two Sovereignslatelyinarmsagainsteach other. Both interviews occur after a war, but in the present case 18 months have elapsed since the lst shot was fired,whilein the former instance the fiaes of Poland were still red with blood, and the echoes of the cannon of Fxiedland had scarcely died away. In 1807, res in 1855, the Russians had been -worsted, but rot until after efforts so heroic that the glory of the vanqu:shed was surpatsed only by that of the victors. Ine valour displayed in the defence of Sebastopol finds its parallel in the unshaken courage with which, when Fricdland and its bridges were in flames, success hopeless, and retreat cut off, the Rus- sian ba'; alions, ravaged by cannon-shot and repeat.. edly charged by the Grenadiera of the Old Guard, still closed their ranks, maintained their array, preserved their artillery, and slowly retired, worsted, but not dismayed. Like the fall of Sebastopol, the defeat of Friedland was the dosing scene of a fierco and bloody campaign. Butpeae,in the former case the result of long nogotiltion;, in the latter was agreed upon within a fer days after the crowning battle, in personal interviews between the two principal Sovereigns concerned-the, poor King of PrwAsa, whose dominions were at stake, and in whose behalf Russia was in the field, being allowed little voioe in the negotiations, while England, with rhos onduct Alexander wa dissatisfied, was simply abandoned by ber northern ly. Diaheartened by his reverse, disusted at the ecantinesw of England' assistance and at Austria's timid policy, dazwed, too, by the prestige and glory of his opponent the young Czar was well disposed to throw himself into the arms of France, and oat tho fifth day ater

(FROM OaUR OWN OBRs'OxND3nT.) TURIN, SBrpr. 2L When The Times criticized a sermon of Cardinal Wiseman's the other day and found it wanting in the patriotism and just indignation that have characterized all classes of Englishmen with regard to the Indian massacres, Mr. Bowyer was hurt at the least suspicion of his friend's patriotism, and adduced as a proof that the Cardinal was devoted to England that he remained there, though subject to all kinds of insults, rather than assume his place among the Princes of the Church of Rome. In the course of the sermon alluded to his Eminence had betrayed his usual animosity to the Government of this country and therefore, of course, his sermon is doubly grateful to the clerical papers here, but they chiefly quote it to prove the injustice with which England has governed India, especially with regard to its Roman Catholic subjects there. At the same time the same papers invariably attribute the most arbitrary and cruel policy to the British Government towards the natives of India, and the Bilancia of Milan, which is published under the aubpices, and partly at the cost, of certain members of the BiBcottini sect, of whom, probably, both Cardinal Wieeman and Mr. Bowyer know something, contains the following characteristic remarks on the last Indian despatch in its number of Saturday:- . "Tho last accounts from India, we repeat, bring nothing decisive; the ;Presidency of Bombay was disturbed, however, and it may be expected that the next steamer will bling accounts of its being in full rebellion, liko that of Bengal. The English of India, if not those of London, and the English press-it is vain to conceal it-feel themselves lost, and in their desperation, and in their blind fury, they commit horrors. In all Europe the butchery of Dinapore will be execrated, where an English officer caused 800 men to be shot at the same time and place. Oh, the Brish piety and generosity! And yet the English journals, even those which preach humanity to the italian Governments. haU this horrible slaughter with a cry of tliumph. By such deeds, execrating the English, they justify the cruelty of sepoys." I could add many other quotations from other journals of the same colour of a similar kind, but this will be sufficient to show your readers the amount of impartiality which 'Ultramontane writers impose upon themselves when treating of English affairs. The Arenia of Turin, or the Cattolico of Genoa, or the Giglio of Florence, would, and have, all said as much as the Bilancia in the way of misrepresentation and calumny. They all look at tbings in every part of the globe from the Vatican, and, now that they fancy they see the vessel of the British State in imminent peril among Indian shoals and rocks, they are ready to crack their voices with shouts of joy. The pious horror of Cardinal Wiseman of this Government, because it seeks to impose reform on the Church of Rome from within tbe body of the Church itself, is well known, and it is not regarded here as by any means an indisputable proof of his Eminence's patriotism that he condescends to reside in EDgland, but rather as a sign of his extreme devotion to his order in remaining at the post where he may best serve its interests, and that, like anotherBrutus, hisEininence is willing to sacrifice his private affections for his public duty -not that he loves England less, but that he loves Rome more, It is a remarkable example, indeed, of the incorrigible Roman bias which sways the judgment of all Ultramontane writers, that even the Tuscan Government has suspended the Jesuit orgau, the Giglio, for two months, in consequence of an article against the IndApendance Bedge, which said that Tuscany had escaped a Concordat and the institutions of the Middle Ages. When the present Grand Dacal Government is obliged to punish a priestly paper for want of respect towards it we cannot be astonished that similar publications elsewhere should abuse their own Government and country, and everything else that is nlu strictly Roman. The Prince de la Tour d'Auvergne, the new French Minister at this Court, is expected here today from Florence, and the Duc de Grammont will leave this for Paris in the course of the week. The weather has lately become settled again, after having been broken for some time, and the warm days and cool nights of the last week have exercised a most beneficial effect on vegetation. The maize crop is in the most perfect state. This crop, which is of so much importance to the rural population, will, it is now asserted, produce more than an average yield. In the llomagna there has been a long drought, and the want of water for irrigation had in some degree been injurious to the rice there, but from Lombardy and the Lomellina the accounts of this crop are highly satisfactory. Many proprietors have great hopes of improved crops, next year from the system of drainage they purpose adopting, and which has been found to succeed adsmirably in many places wvhere it has been adopted. While the oldium on the vines has been less felt in the south than in the north, it has in a great measure disappeared in Ital.y, without any reference to climate. It is much diminished in Lombardy. A fair quantity of wine wrill be made in the Rcmagna, a little in Tuscany, a little in Naples, and an t.verage quantity in Sicily; a half crop may be calculated on hi the island of Sardinia and something more in Piedmont. On the whole, it is reckoned that the crop wrill produce perhaps a fifth more than that of last year.
THB INDIAN HUTINrEs. _ THE SUFFERERS AT CAWNPORE, -mne loiowing letter has been addressed to the editor of the BFmglishman - " Sir-I am dedired by General Neil to request you will have the goodness to make it as public a possible that the property of the unfortunate people who lost their lives here has been collected in one spot, and that any which can be recognized wiMl be handed over to the owners, or put up to auction for the benefit of deceased estates, and the reat sold. " There Is a good deal of property belongLng to the different mercantile firma here, as well as to the heirs of deceased officers, &c., but when I mention that every hous was guttd, and the property scattered ovor 60 or 70 squar3 miles of country, it will be appuent how impossible it wras to take care of individual interests. " I would recomamend any one connected with Cawwpore, to appoint an agent upon the spot who can recognize the property, and he should be armed with authority to receive charge of it. "Almost all of the former European residents here having been murdered by the miscreant Nena Sahib, and no one being forthcoming to recognize or give any information concerning the property that has been saved, it would aid us very much were some European to return who may be acquainted with the former residents, or be able to point out the property of different owners. " I am desired to add that as far can be ascertainedthe only Europeans M.ao escaped re two officers and two soldiers, who fled across the river, and one pensioner of the 3d IUght Dragoons, who was conoealed by a trooper of thj 4th Light Cavalhy In the city of Cawnpore. " There are six males, three females, and three chidren with a petty rajah (of Kalpee) across the Jumna, and every possible means are being taken to recover them. "The Rajah of Kalpee treats theseo unfortunate people with kindnees, and is disposed to restore them. " The pressure of work is so great that it Is imposdble to send copies of this letter to the different presses in India, but General NeiU 6rusts all wiU aid him in maldng public the information now conveyed.

Sir,-Perhaps the following extracts rnay not have come to your notice; and, as all authentic Information is valuable to many, you may think It right to copy them. There is no doubt that the first of the two journals vwas written by Mss Caroline Lindsaay, eldest daughter of Ms. GeorgeLindsay, in all probability on the day of the final massacre, in the hope that it might reach the hands of her distressed relations, as by God's good providence it has done. No mention being made of the death of her youngest sister Fanny, it is to be feared that she was also stil alive, and that they perished together on the 16th of July. Dundee, Sept. 23. B (Extracted from 27w Pheniz, Calcutta newspaper, of August 8.) The writer of the painfully interesting Cawnpore Ietter which we published yesterday stated that he had picked up scraps of paper among the clothes of the unfortunate women who met their death in Nena Sahib's slaughter house. The mournful men:orials referred to are spotted with blood, and contain the following inscribed upon them in pencil in female handwriting. Both the scraps seem to be leaves from the private journals of two different persons, as the writing is not the same. One of these pieces of paper runs as follows:- "Mamma died, July 12.* Alice died, July 9.t George died, June 27. 4 Entered the barracks, May 2L Cavalry left June 5. First shot fired, June 6. "Uncle Willy died, June 18.§ Aunt LUly, June 17.11 Left barracks June 27. Made prisoners -a soon as we were at the river." The other is in the following words:- "We went into the barracks on the 21st of May, the 2d Cavalry broke out at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 5th of June, aud the other regiments went off during the day. The next morning, while we were all sitting out iu front of the barracks, a twenty-four pounder came flying along, and hit the intrenchment, and from that day the firing went on tili the 25th of June; then the enemy sent a treaty which the General agreed to, and on the 27th we all left the B. to go down to A. in boats. When we got to the river the enemy began firing on us, kllled al the gentlemen and some of the ladles, set fire to the boats; some were drowned, and we were taken prisoners and taken to a house, put all in one room." The above sad relics speak for themselves. Hard must be the heart of the reader that can peruse them without the strongest emotion. THE SIEGE OF DELHI To give the public an idea of what the fighting before Delhi consists of, and to show that the "pluck" of the British soldier is as brilliant in the heat of India as in the biting cold of the Crimea, we publish the following extract of a letter from an officer in high command with our force there. It should be remembered that the action he describes is but one of a series that has extended over a month, and that scarcely a day has been allowed to pass without the enemy isauing in swarms to harass our overworked troops:- "The day commenced with firing on the Ghoorka posts. Jackson, of the 2d Fosileers, with No. 1 company, very weak, at'tacked and drove back the mutineers from Subzee 3iundee, but, not being reinforced, he was obliged to retire, and in retiring the gallant feRow was kiUed. Skrmdishing went on on the hill to the right of Eindoo Rao's house the whole day. - The Ghoorkas and Rifles were engaged, and drove back the mutineers four times. After each attack our men fell back into their positions; when the mutineers, relieved by their numbers, again came on, our men became exhausted by heat and exertion, and supports after each attack wero necessary, until at last all the available force was engaged. Welchman, -with the left wing of the lst Fusileers, after Jackson's death, had advanced and had taken possession of Sabzee Mundee again,when he was severelywounded and had to leave the field; the wing cleared the streets, but the enemy renewed their attack four times, and were successively repulsed. Young Owen, of the Ist, highly distinguished himself, charging four times down the street with his company; his galantry was very conspicuous. The right wing in the meantime continued their advance under Dennis, and, after driving away the mutineers and killing a large number in a serai, they retired exhausted to Hindoo Rae's house. The big guns on the right flank fired occasionally, but owing to the nature of the ground the enemy could avoid them. Al our troops had now been engaged, and the greater part had fallen back exhausted. The General then airected me to the Mosque Battery, where applications were being constantly sent for reinforcements. I sent every xvailable man. I was then directed to assume comnrind at Hindoo Rao's. When I arrived there I found everyone exhausted and done up. There were the 1st Fusileers and some Rifles aUldone up. I went on to the new advanced battery; it was crowded with worn-out men; the zrtillerymen, likewise done up, had ceased firing; another partyof Rifles in a similar state in anotherposition; 120 men of the 2d Fusileers, who had marched 23 miles that moranlg,andhadhad nobreakEastwerolyingdown exhausted; three weak companiea of Ghoorkas were out as skirmishers, but they too were exhausted, and the remainder were r. ing under a rock. The heat was terrific, and the thermometer munt have been at least 14f0 degrees, with a hot wind blow. ing, and a frightful gla. Well, the mautineers all this time from behind walls and rocks, were keeping up a brisk fire oll along our front-i.e., to the right of Hindoo Rlao' house, as far as Sabzee Mandee, and abatter of two guns from Kissengung was fir ing upon us without having itretuxued I ordered up, when at Hindoo Ras100 of the l1t Fusileera; after serving out grog to them; I tbrow themr forwad to the left front of the now battery.

The following 2s an extract of a private letter of the 8th of Augttut :- "In my last I comaunicatod the safety of this fortress, from-the prompt measores taksn by the commandant I will now detail the co nces an tbey took place rsprdiag it. Prior to the 27th of June offlici communications had been rooeived from the Resident at Indore that the greater portion of the Gwlior (Scindlan) Con. tingent had mutitied, and, Asseezghnr being garrisoned by a wing of them, the head-quarters of which nutilaed on the 12th of June at Leallatpore, the commandant felt anxiety for the safety of thls fortres The Sepoys at that time were obedient and orderly, and performed their duty satis. fectorily, but he was apprehensive, though they would march anywhere they might be ordered, they would show relactanoe to fight aainst their own kindred. Under theae circumstances 'passivenesse was the utmost we could expect them to show, if we were certain of their remaining passive. The fact of their volanteering to serve anywhere proves nothing, as the whole contingent volunteered to do likewse, and in the sace of a few days broke out Into open mutiny. It was obvious bow very disastrous the capture by mutineers of a fortress with a prestige like Asseerghur would be, and the extreme importance that disaffected and fanatical men would attach to such an ocourrence. The inhabitants of Aaeorghnr and its neighbourhood were wel affected towards the Goverment, and by embodying for temporary servioe 100 to 150 active men the commandant conceived the safety of the fortress could be secured. Be sauggested that Major-General Woodburn might be directed to detach a company or two of a Bombay Native Infantry regiment for duty at Aeerghur, and to take on vith him the wing of thelcontingent stationed at Aseerghur, and that instructions to this effect might be telegraphed to Malligaum, whence they could communicate by letter in time to enable him to make the recessary angementg for procuring carriage, &. But the removal of the contingent from the fort was required without any delay, in oonseqnence of intelligence received a few days after. On the night of July 4 the commandant received a hurried note from the political assistant at Kemur, despatched from Boreganm, giving inteligence of the attack -pon Mhow and Indore, artd clearly showing ho entertained the worst apprehensions regarding those stations, as well as for the sfetyofAaseerghur. After ahurried consultation only two measures appeared calculated to meet the emergency-viz., either to trust to the loyalty of the contingent or to remove them, on plausible grounds, from the fortress before the news regarding Indore and Mhow could possibly reach them. The commandant unhesitatingly decided on carrying out the latter measure, and at daybreak on the following morning the offioer commanding tho wing was ordered to warn his wing that they were to acCompany the field force expected at A sseerghur in a day or two, and encamp below without any delay. The convicts in the gaol carried down the tents of the win, and by eevning all was in readiness. However, to avoid the appearance of unusual hurry, the troops were ordered not to move below tll the follov,ing morning. A strong party of police peons were ststioned at *he northern entrance, as rwel as at the southern gate of the town, and every traveller from either Indore or Boorampore rigidly searched for letters, and spies were also distributed all over the bazaar and Sepoy' lines to ascertain the sentiments of the men regarding their contemplad march. Towards evening a good deal of murmuring and dissatisfaction were heard in the bazaar, and one or tw o Sepoys used in conversation with a Marwaree 'he significant words, 'Wait, and you will swe what happens to-morrow morning.' The majority, though not satisfied perhaps, were not likely, the commandant thought, to break out in open mutiny, nor would the native officers, he bellered, have supported them in so acting. Still he felt great anxiety, and shortly after midnight the Fort Adjutant received an express from tne Soobah of Boorampore, conveying the alarming news that the company of this regiment detached from Aseeerghur in June had broken into open mutiny, and were making the best of their way to Ass-erghur. Under thesa circumstanuces a havildar of the regiment, with two well-affected and loyally-disposed Sepoys, was immediately sent off by tho havildar-major of the regiment, to meet the mutineers, and endeavour to induce them to return to Boorampore. Partly by parsuasion and partly by threats the company did return, and mainly to this clrpumstance the safety of the fortress is attributable. At sunrise the regiment paraded and marched below in a quiet and orderly manner; immediately after which a party of 8& men, who had been quietly got together a day or two previously, and varned to be in readiness, were marched into the fortress, and in another hour the regimental guards were relieved, And joined their comrades at the encamped ground. The commandant had previously communicated to the officer commanding a de. tachment of Eheel corps his wish that be should disarm the mutinous company at Boorampore, which duty he efficiently performed. The commandant considers that, under Providence, the precautions taken to prevent the men receiving any news of the mutiny in their regiment, andespeciallyof the outbreak at Indore and Mhow, have raateriaUy tended to bring about the present satisfactory state of things, and there is no doubt that had the wing of the contingent seized the fortress very much valuable time would have been lost in recovering it, in addition to the confidence it would have given to the thousands in rebellion against the State. The proceedings of the commandant were duly reported to the authorities. The Commander-in-Chief iu communicating them to Government stated he considered the prompand derided conduct of the commandant(Colonel Le Messurier) on this occasion to have mainly contributed to our tenure of that important stronghold at the present crisis. The Government, in reply, remarked that Colonel Le Mes. surier deserved rery high commendation for the ready resolution with which he acted on this trying occasion, and by which he had no doubt secured the important fortress under his charge from falling into the hands of the mutinous troops, and requested his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief to warmly express to Colonel Le Messurier the thanks of the Right Hon. the Governor in Councl for the service he had rendered to the State, which was accordingly done. We have now four companies of the 5th Regiment of Native Infantry here. The two companies of the 19th that were here marched for Malliga,um yesterday. We areolookingfor the London mail of July 10 to bring us the feelings of England on this dreadful revolt of the wholeBengal army, and the measures adopted to save the country from utter destruction. Havelock's success will be the first cheering news since the outbreak. Had the troops destined for China not been intercepted Calcutta would not have been able to send Havelock's column against the mutineers. The news of these troops reaching Calcutt3, magnified into many thousands, has had a wonderful effect over the country. It was insufficiency of Euro. peans at the principal stations which had emboldened the mutineers. The distress throughout England will be greater than that felt in the late Crimean war. There we lost our brave officers and soldiers, but their wives and ohildren were safe at home. Here the women and children massacred wiU far exceed the number of officers killed. The scoundrels made no distlnctlon between them. " We have two or three dreary months before us before English troops can arrive in any numbers to settle the oountry. When they have all arrived and taken the field then willUthe work of slaughter be done onthe mutinoers. Not one wfi be spared. The approach of oar moveabl coln s of Europeans from different points wll so alrm the scoundrels that tbey wil not show fight, but settle among themselves. to disperse in small bodies over tho country, and by so doing will fll into the hands of men who will be too ready to. secure tbe reward offered by the Government on evey. mutineer.

THE IOTH FOOT. Tho following is a copy of a letter from a. privato. of the loth Foot "Dinapore, July 1I. "My dear Grandfather,-It is with feelingsof the deepest egret that I have to tell you that the entire of India Is one theatre of open and undisguised rebellion, bloodshed, viol.. tion, rapine, and murder, and a rebellIon of such an unnatural character that it standsoutin lioldjrelW in tbehiory of the world, unequalled for its ingratitade, and unparalelea for the feroity, brutality, and cruelty of its acts; it is the rebelion of the Sepoys (native soldies) against the Governmcnt, against ChTiatianity, and against the life and property of every white man in India; asd, not content with attacking soldiers and using their firearms against- armed men these monsters in human shape have waged war with defenceless women and innocent children, sarificing in their blind and brutal rage the old man and the maiden, the pregnant woman and the unwoaned babe, and that with suoh arefinement of cruelty that one would suppose the devil himself reig4ed paramount and slono-that there Wm no tCi.ect, no mercy, and no hol', ave of the revenge which hic/t juatIy will be taken on th'o fends. 1* every station wherever E1.ropans hve. faUen inte their h**ds they have been mwrderzd in cold blood, their dea& bodies mutilated, the raven and the jackl preing on the remains of as brave men and 8 fair women as ever left onr shores. However, w anre getting out troope as fast u We san, and againt thi3 day thr montl's the name of Sepoy wi1 be erased from the dictionary of t be world, and tse homes of thee devilg will be but dia, b ible by the burning embers and ameldering ashes of Tilia,sw, which, lke the CtieT of the Plain in Scripture, will at s nce aerve 'or tbh aceneof their dmes and their sopolchre" "At Dlelh, y dewr grndfather, the diabolical c duelt7 of th&Sepeys is horrible to relate; theY paraded a.' the uropean bea up- ant do-n the city in a east, u I at Allahaid the 6th Native Infantry, who had reoeived pra._ 'o a the morning for their oyalty to Gorernment, fell or& 1heir offlcers in the evening while they were at mess, and killed 17 of them. The Adutant of the regiment thy tailed to an arm-rack, and made a *taet of h body; *nother officer was pinioned to the ground with bayonets, and a fire lit on kiF body, At another station there was. one officer ala hiR- JirHhe kiled seven of the miis' rant with his own h=ad, aod when he saw there was no, chance for himelf or his wife, he ehot her and then limsef, before he weeld let her fall into the hands or the epoYs, because he we& well awae what her fate would be -rape and then murder. At a station clled Fyzabd two native rgiments of fee bud OnD of hoe, with a battry of Pmns, mautinied and kil)ed some of their officers; one edonels lady saw her husband shot in frolt of her eyes, she then went raving mad through the jtmgle with her two infants. I had this from a survivor, ene that egcaped in a' boat with about 20 more Europeans, principally romen and children; he saw the lady with her children on the bank and caUed her to him, but sho hooked at them for a moment and then ran screaming away, dragginR her hildren after her. They could not land to pusue, because the Sepoys were coming down on them at the time to mnurder them, I have sineo heard that tho lady has been rescued, but is stll a maniac. At another station they have murdered 54 Europeans-the place is called JhanDi; one officer kIled no less than 26 of the rufflians before he wa killed himself. A sergeant and his wite ind two children barricaded themselves in their house; the woman said she would shoot the first man that entered, and she wls as good as her word. She did so, and then was shot herelf. The husband escaped, and the two children In attempting to follow him were caught and thrown Into the flames, as they had set fDu9 to the house. I told you in my last letter that the rebels made off to DelhL TheY have fortified it in every direction and one Mauder Khan ha. syled himself Commander-in. Chief of all the Mussulmans In India. I believe there are about 30,000 Sepoys in Delhi at present. We have a rumour here that it has been retaken by the British with great losg, but I believe the place is still in the hands of the mutineers. We sent two of our companies from this to Benares; they were ordered with three guns to go and disarm the 37th Nistive Infantry, which Is sationed there. They fired on our fellows and killed two and wounded eight more, and one captain of the Irregular Cavalry killed and two more wounded. Two of our men have since died of their wounds. " But the most fearful of all the tragedies I have to tell you about. At Cawnpore all the Europeans have been masacred to A maL They had iatrenched tbemselves in the European hospital, commanded by Major-General Sir H. Wheeler. He was mortally wounded, and then the ropeans came to terms with the .Rajah Nena Sahib that they were to depart peaceably in boats With what money they had, which amounted to 33 lacs of rupees, when this miscreant, PIljah NenA Sahib, got them into the boats and launched out into the river, brought cannon to bear on them, and murdered every one of them,-nearly 303 people in all,-viz., 90 men of Her Majesty's 84th Begiment, 17 men of the Ist Madras Fusiliers, and the whole of the women and children of Her Majesty's 32d Regiment, 60 women and about 150 children, all murdered in cold blood, and about a dozen offlicers of note, and also a battery of guns, comprising abouti 60 Europeans. " There were about 132 Enropeans, priDcipalUy females, coming from Furruckabad in boats. They enticed them to. the bank and brought them on to the Sepoy parade ground, where they cruelly butchered them all. I couldn't tell all the horrors that have been enacted in this country. Some of the horrible murders will never be known. I think, grandfather, that there have been more European officers killed here than there were altogether in the Crimea. " We never get any news here except by chance, s all oommunication is stopped with the Upper Proinces. They have out the telegraph wire, and no letters can pas up or down the country for them. The Commander-in-Chief died at Kumn3ul last month. There are many more stations that have mutinied and killed their offioers, but we have not hieard any account of them yet. I will give you another instance of their horrible cruelty,-one European of1icer, a commissiorer at Delhi, with his wife (who vas pregnant), and four children; they tied tb2e husband in a chair, and then out the heads off his four children, and ripped opea his wife, And took the unborn babe from her, and struck the husband across the face with it, and then shot him. My dear grandfather, you would scarcely credit all these awful things; but I can assure you it is all too true. There was also a conspiracy discovered at Calcutta to massacre all the Europeans there and take possession of Fort William. It was fortunately found out, and the King of Onde taken prisoner, who, it was said, is at the bottom of all this rebellion. I don't think there is any likelihood of us going home this yesr, or the next, perhaps, if this doesn't cease; but we must only live in hope. There is only one regiment here and only one company of Artlery to watch three mutinous regiments alongside of us, and murderers oa aU sides of us. Nothing but fear prevents them rising here and enacting all the horrors, all the brutalities, and aU the atrocious murders of their brother misoreants in the Upper Provinces; but we have abandoned sleep and watch them night and day; nothing but continuous patrols all the night long, sentries challenging, armed parties passing each other, so that a bird can scarcely rattle a branch witbout attracting the notice of the ever-watchful, sleepless sentineL *T remain, my dear Grandfather, " Your affectionatA ,van(san- " LICHARD DOUGLAS."

.ESCAPE OF A LADY FROM DELHI. Weave been favoured with a copy of the following'letter. The writer describes herself and her 3ausband as having lost all they poswessed, and aa k6eing in sad want of assistance:- Camdeu Villa, SImla July 22. On the morning of the 11th of May, about 7 a.m., the nurgents from Meerut reached the bzidge of boats at Ddhi, bat we heard nothing of it till about hlfpast 9 a.m. We heard the sad news in this way - hMy husband, ohild, and myself were spending oar last vweek in India with Dr. Wood and his ife as he had been very ill and a ohange of climate was recommended Iby his medioal attendants, We were to have proaeded tIX Calcutta on the 15th of that month, and every arrangement bad been made for our journey, even to our dAk being paid; but, alas I we were astonished at hearng from the natve doctor who came to make his usual report regarding the sick to Dr. Wood, tho sad tidings that the mutineers had ac. lually been alowed to pass over the bridge of boats and were then within the city walls. It was reported that witbia the short space of one hour the insurgents had killod thLe Commissioner, Mr. Fraser; She Fort Adjutant, Captain Douglas; the Tlev. Xr. Jennings and his daughter, a young lady about 19 years of age, together with many others vhose names I do not remember. The above was being related to us whent we received a message from Ms. Pa. terson, the wife of a Major Paterson, of the 54th Begiment Native Infantry, to beg Westwood and myself to go over to her house quiclsy, and as she only Ulved across the road we went immediately. In the verandah we met Major Paterson, dressed in uniform, from whom we head that sis regiment, the 54th, bhd been ordered down to the city of Delhi to quell the disturbance, and that he was to take the command of the guns, four in number. The regi. 3ment was then on the parade ground waiting for ordes, and us we were living close to the 54th lines we saw them pas the house, and from their cheerful appeanoe and yet de-. termined look we congratulated ourselves on havng such a brave set of fellows, aa we thought, to go forward and figkt for us. Colonel Ripley, the commandant of the re. gimext, headad It, and lost no time in appearing hefore the wretches in the city, leaving Major Paterson to bring up the guns; and as it was, of toorse% a planned thing among the native guuners to delay with the guns, Major Paterson had to 'wait no less than four hourI before he could take them to the city. When he reached that place he became, as he told me, lak at heart; for the I frst person whom he met was his Colonel, supported by ont of the buglers of the regiment through the Cashmeregate to a pallle-ghrrie, for he had been so dreadflay out about that the poor man wa unable of himnaelft to movn After the bugler had placed Colonel Ripley ia the cariage the coachman drove to the bells of arms, in the Delhi cautonments, at 'which place the Conel had his wounds looked to, and by this time Dr. Dopplng, ot The 54th, Captain Smith, Captain Burrows, two lieutenants and one ensign, all of the same reginent, had been killed, and were lying in a heap at the slope leading to the fflcersr quarters at the Cashni6re gate. Mrs. Wood, 3Irs. PaterSon, and myself began to consider that we were in rather a precarious position ourselves, and we were advlsed to go forthw%th to the 38th hospital and there find protectioa througi4 the guad stationed there. We all three ladles started,in Mrs. Paterasn's carriage, taking with us Mrs I'atersop's two little girls and my dear boy. On our reach. ing the. hospital we were told that all the ladies had taken refuge in the Flagstaff Tower, and thac we had better go llhewise. We found the native gunner, who were stand. ing about, most rude, but the Sepoys in general were as respectful as usual. The native doctor of the 38th took me ko his house and told me that if I was frightened he could bide me in an underground room which he showed me, but I ftlt more secure by going to the Flagtaff Tower. Here we were told that poor Colonel Ripley was lying at the bells of arrs, dreadfully wounded. We proceeded immediately to iabe place where he lay to see if we could render him any assistance. We found him lying on a bed of very rough manufacture. We found a sergeant's wife near the place where poor Colouel Ripley was lying, who brought us a nice soft rezie, which we folded once or twice doable, and laid him upon it. This appeared to comfort his wounds, and after we applied some lavender water to his temples he seemed much better and talked to us. He wvas, of course, in g.eat agony, and beRged of the native doctor to give him a dose of opiumL to deaden his sufuerings, and, after some persuasion, the doctor did so. The Colonel was then so much better that he pointed to one frightful wound In his left shoulder, and told us that the men of his own regiment had bayoneted htm. We 'rere afraid to remain longer -with the Colonel, having our own little ones to proteot, and therefore bade him farewell, promising, as I did, to go homne and persuade my husx band, who was himself very ill, to go and see to his wantS. On our way we met men and women servants in every direction, looking dreadfully confused and apprently greatly conCerned for uS. Before wo reached home anothor wounded man, a sergeant, I believe, of tho 54th, was being rarried to the hospital in a dooLv; hs had been shot in the leg, which we were told afterwaris was broken. On reaching home our servants begged of us not to remain In the house, for it was fully understood that tho bungalows -were to be burnt at night. Thinking, however, we mighl nave our clothes, and other little articles which for years past I had been gathering together, Mrs. Wood and I paoked our boxes, and ordered our servants to hide them in the fowl-house, and we took our jewel cases wIth us. When we left the bungalow it wa about 2 o'clock p.m. We took the road to the Flagstaff Tower, and my husbarnd went to the bells of arms to see what he could do for Colonel Rtipley, whom he soon removed from that place into a dooly, and rode by his sid9 to the Flagstaff. The Colonel was quite senslble, for he asked my husband to seoure all his papers from his housw for him, which my husband did. By this time the people at the Flagstaff were ina great state of alarra having heard that the King of Delhi instead ot aiding us was sending scaling ladders for the Sepoys to scale the wlaUs of the magazine, which they very succossfully did. Lieutenant Willoughby, finding that he had but a fow sergeants to hold the magazlne with him, laid a train, and it is said that some 400 of the Insurgents were fairly inside when the place was blown up. Certainly I felt much frightened when I found that the magazine had been blowa up, to say nothing of the 38th Regiment flying to their arms and crying out " Deen, Deen 1i ("religion"), The magazine could not have been blown up entirely, for the report was so slight; the sight was very sad to look at the heavens being Perfectly blackened as it were from the b]ack smoke. Seeing the Sepoys fly to their arms it was zdvised that their bayonets should bo at once taken from them, and placed at the top of the Flagstaff, as it was then fully believed that If we depended on our Sepoys for assistance we should be but poorly cared for. The men, astonishing to say, allowed themselves to be robbed of their arms, and I for one assisted in passinig them to the top of the tower, whUe the gentlemen and merchants from the city brought in boxes upon boxes of powder, caps, and bul. lets, which were all lodged at the top of the tower. Every mninu.e things bore a blacker look, and when the artillery commandant, Captain De Tessier, came in with his trowsers covered with blood he told his wive, who was close to me with a young babe in her arms, that she ought to be most thankful that his life had been spared, his horse having been shot from under him. The insurgents then took tiwr of our light guns. Information then reached us that the Sepoys were actually shooting down their own offi. cers, and finding that it was not thdx intention to fight for us some advised a retreat on KurnauL The people we, however, a long time making up their minds as to what they had better do. At lst, Captain Tyler, of the 38th, said his men would accompany us, and my hus. band, beLlg an officer of that regiment, did his beet in assist. Ing Captain Tyler to get the men together. Major Kayvett was in cormmand of the regiment, but it remains to bs Proveo why, at a dangerous moment lke that, he did not take the command of his orp; Colonel Graves, the Brigadier, had no one to advise him apparently; and I do not thinli any one present envied him his post. Had any one of sense and thought ordered the ladles and children away from Delhi in the early part of the day, I, for one, should not have had to undergo suoh a journey. About 6 p.m. a cart, drawn by buyllcks, arlved at the Flagstat .wo wer, apd I heard it whispered that it contained the un.- fortunate officers and eight sergeantu who had been so brutally kilUed in the dty. The cart w covered over with oDne or two ladies dresses, to screen the dead from view, hut one of their arms was distinctly notiCfd by myself, as it was iassgLug over the side of the cart. Captain Tyler now in- sisted on the people leaving for Kurnaul, a distance ot about 70 mles from Delhi, but several ladles present de. claimed against going as thel husbands had bean abselnt since thq morning. Alas ! one or two of these ldes werea then widows, although they knewIt not. One young lady. whose poor brother was lying in the cart outside the lag. staff, was inquiring of several of the offioers if they bad seen him, she little thinldng that he was numbered among tbe dead. Night was f.t closing In, and ie bugle was at last sounded for the retreat to Kurnaul. Here a feerful scene presented itself ; ecriages of every description ware in waiting, although m any of the oachmen, whose master had good carriages and horse, returned to eantonments in torder to secure them for thfemselves. I had no conveyance up at the Flagstaff, as I went wills Mrs. Paterson, sad my susbandxode. Everybody, with the exfepUen of one eor two ladies and gentlemen, were by tlis lime fairly off on their way to Kunaul and Meesut, One gentleman, seeing te standing by, offered me a seat in his cariage, and, as I bad my little boy, I placed him in with him. thinklng to follow him with Mrs. Wood. ajorPaeon'soachman made off with his oarrlrge and horses mmediatelywe quitted it, and she was leift, lik mylf and 1Mr. Wood, to depend OP friends. Fortunately two empty buges wcelow ty, and Mmn Wood and I took one, but Mrs. Patbr. Eon and her chbldren wzer in anoter. Mrs. Pateon, I asg happy to say,got away with Wt others, and after Mrs.W6od =nd I had proceeded a short d41tance we met her husb6nd, who was being carried on a bed, he unfortunately having been shot in the face by, It is supposed, his owrn regiment, the 38th. The Sepoys were rounding our bugg, but they were quite olvil to us, and when they saw the doctor wounded they all stood still, and after asking them to help to assist him in his hospital dooly, which we fortunately seourdontheroad,one ortwo of the Sepoysrnutolhm. I shall not easily forget the -manner in which the remn. nants of the different corps, viz., the 38th 54th, and 74th, made their way to their.lines as thej were walking along like so many wandering sheep. Idid not see any of their commanding offlorasheading them, as in my opinion they ought to have done. Colonel Ripley was among the poor wetches who were all but killed in the city, and was then in a hospital dcooylikewisne. The doctor's oariao wap followrlg him, andfortunate for him that it vA, astphe rrrefunsedto carrmhim farther than the lues. My husband, not knowing how he was to get on, inquired of te Brigade Major, Captain Nicol, howIt was to be maaged; the answer he received was, " The best way you can." Myhusband thenlejt us to go to the qurter-guard of his regiment to ee If he could prevail on his LoompPy to accomapany ustioKurnaul, and we went on towards Kurnaul, the doctor being insde his close crage, and Mrs. Wood and myself following him up in a buggy. When we left theparade-growud it was about f. past 6 p.m., and we were the last ldles to leave the station. Weohd only prooeded a short disanoe on the Kurnaul road wheu Eome men came to us and begged of us not to proceed any further on the road as the whole of fte ofos and ladies who had gone before us had been mrrdered and that we should meet the same fate if we persisted on eur journey. We knew not what to think, and at first resolved to go on our journey let what miht follow, rhen a verY neatly dreed native, a perfect bo, made b1s appearance; he. made Uls a most respeAtful lam, and tol&' us that ho ws In the employ of Iutnuat Hlland, the Quartermaster of the 38th, zAd *dvised a tking the road he pined 'out, and very kindy took us of the Grind Trauik road into somae fields. Wq o* not drive quicky as she land WAS perfecty. rugged. We had only walked our horm short distabn wha tthe thought AMk me that the men who were surrounding us wee nothing les thn robbes 'themselves. Th!i hought wa 7ory soft conflimed by the men coming ap ,o tw nad#kngeorupo"s. I had feOW rnOeS in my jewel-box, but wasafrald to ea, it e they should see what It conld, nd thefore told them to go to our house and take anything they=tka fatc to,. T6ey particularlg inquired were our house wa situated, and I explained it to deM asw eU as I coald Theyi however, fancied we had poney, with tuand ined on my showing them the eat of the bugg, -and they sercbed every corner of it, but till I maaaedtokekp my jewel-box. I was driving, with Mrs. Wood by my sde, and the hood of the buggy being down the vile wretches hd a, capltal opportunity of stauding up behind, and with the number of tulwars and stloks which they had could have killedus in avery short space of time. mWoodhadablackI velvet headdress on, and as it had ome bugles about it it glittered a good deal in the moonlight, and when they saw this thaey lost no time in tearing it from herhead, and at the smeO time struck her rathe. heavily with one of their ticks. We haA by this again reached the Grank Trunk road. Here we met the two guns, which, by the ay, accompanied thoe who started before ourselves out of the station. One of the cavalry men was ridingl by the side of the guns, a,d at first I was inclined to think that aid had reached us from, Um. ballah or Meerut, instead of which it was the guns returning to the city. I called out to the trooper, fearlesw at tWe time of being murdered, to assist us by directing us our saest road. The &nswerI roceived was-" Go that way,' pointing to Kn-ul, " you will get murdered. Come this," pointing to DoLhi, "and you ill meet the same fate." We wore then. quite close to the gunners and the dreded trooper, but they offered us no insolence. One of the gun. ners, in fact, got off the gun-cariage and walked the whole way by the side of the buggy to the Company's-gardens at Delhi, to which place we at last determined to go. At the arched gate of the gardens we met two men, and from the implements which they held in their hauda we took them for gardeners. They promisd to shelter us in the huts in the garden, and we followed moct readily to them. Here they brought a eharpoy for the doctr to take ret on, and we sat by him. The gunner was Atill with us, and as we were closo to the lines w askd the gunner to go to the hospital for some lint, and to ask the native dootor to come to us, In order that the Wound might be dresse The man performed hiserandmost faith. fully, for about an hour after we hWa dapatchd hima coohe came with the lint and some badages, teling us that the native doctors wrez tied hand and toot, and were by order of the Ring of Delhi placed in dooly4 :and wer starting for the city to take hrrge of the King' troops, otherwise they would -ist readily have come to our assist. ance. This Is the message they sent to Uf. By this time the villagers had foand out that two ladies and a doctor were secreted in the gardens, and bands after bands nmae their appearance. The gardener advised our taldng sheltr inside the hat, as he said that they would be sure to kdll him if they found he was protecting us tUp to tbhb time both charpoys were outside In the garden, for the night was Tery hot. Finding that the bungalows were al in a blaze we at first feared lest the hut might be fired likewine; we however found that, instead of its being thatchd like most of them usually are, it was tiled, and hesitated not in taldng refuge. The gardeners then locked us inside, but we had scarcely been shut up when another baed of robbers, aboat 60 in number, made a rush at tho door. We kept quite still, thinking they might leave us, but wo hoard them determine on brealdng the look, which wa soon effected, and into the hut they rushed. I went up t, one of them and implored him to save us. He asked for what we had. I told him we had lost every. thing we possessed, but until he had searched us he 'would not give credit to what we told him. Certain it wa for even to my bonnet and cloak had been taken, and the carriage horses and buggy horse ridden away, whither we Inewv not. They were not satisfied with taking our horses, but broke up the carriage and buggy in our presence MMrs. Wood and I knew not what to do or where to go to. Certainly we could not remain in the gardens when daylight came; we therefore made up our minds to take the doctor as best we couldandgoinsearch of avillage. We had no one with us but the doctor's ooachmau, who remained with the doctor, whom we laid under a Large mango tree til we returned to take him for the night to a village near the Artillery lines. When we reached the vlllage it must have been about 3 o'clock a.r_ on the morning of the 12th. We had to plead very hard for shelter, but when we were admitted we found the people very kind, and they gave u, native bread, and the doctor some milk to dnk. We tried to take rest, but sleep at a time like this was quite out of the question. We were in the open air til daybreak, when the head man of the village, a Hindoo, advised our golng into a comehed, the cattle having been taken out for our reception. Fortunate, indeed, it was that the good old man took these precautions, for soon after day light one of the women ran to the shed and begged of us to remain quite quiet as some Sepoys wero just entering their village. I at first tbought she wishedto frighten us, and the first thing I did was to look over the mats which formed, the door, and sure enough there stood a Sepoy; and had he been standing with his face towards the shed in Which we were secreted he must have seen me. He was, however standing talking to the old man of the villag, and WaS manldg a request for carts and bulocks to assist in taking away the ofdicQer property. He was dresfed in every way like a Sepoy, with the exception of pantaloons; in place of the latter article of drews he had on the dhotee, usually worn by the natives of India. The mau appeared in a great hurry to get rid of the Sepoy, for he gave him bullooks and earta in a very abort space of time. We were anxious to set out that night on our wearisome journey, and beggea some of the women of the village to give us water to wash the doctor's shirt. This they did most willngly, and glad, Indeed, were we to have an opportunity of making him somewhat comfortable, for he was perfectly saturated with blood. The men of the village gave us some more bread, and after having flled our water-flsk, which was an earthen one, we started about 6 p.m. on the 12th. As we knew not where to find the main road, one of the villagers, a tall fine young man, offered to accompany us a short distance. We avalded ourselves of his kind offer, and he took us in safety to the Grand Trunk road. Here h parted from, us, and five or six horrble-looking ruffians appr9aeled us. We told them that we had lost everything, and that Vwe ere then on our way to KurnauL They-wakd several questons, and etch queetion ws replled to mnost cvilly by me. When they found, from making a searchon our pers themselves, that we had really nothing to be robbed of, one of the men inquired of one who had a tulwar (or sword) when he would tako our Eives. This I heard most distinctly, and, seeing him who had mdo tbe above-mentioned remark turn back with all but this one man, who, by the way, assured his friend that he would murder us, to se his own words, "a little way further on the road," I went boldly up to the man and told him to pre me sa I h dson little boy who had- gone a-hed, whither I knew not, and tnat Iliad left my husband on the pade-ground at Delht th aight before, and had not hex2d of him inoe, and a I wantq 4p hurry on iu sarch of my child I begged of him to spese my life.

By' thii' time the horsemen wore at a standtiL. Iapproched the n, not utteng % word, wher'; he xclaimed, "-Why, it's a maine Sahib," or In English "ale,dy." Pindingtht bhespoke very kindly Ifelt new l3fe as it were in me, amd told him that we were refuge fropaDelhi, andas &we a a wounded man we could only travel at the rate of about four, or at the meet fiv miles au#ngthe nzg4 'and tht we were taWdng a little rest bythe road side. I then Inquired of them who theywere, and woenoe theyhad come.

The Sepoy then ased me howr we coild get to Kurn^al with a man with hli under. jaw pirtlally shot away, and in his vwek state. Thinking myse'l that we should never reach that place without some oonvewanoe bor the doctor, I asked them to take us all to Agra with them, and,, after some persualon, the head 'man of the party consented to take us; and as ther ,ere but two spare aulmals, one horse and one pony, 'there w acry ou bol they could mau to emvey a third person. I agreed to rlde on one of the troopek horses by their side, while the doctor was mounted on a b~sutiful shite horse and Mrs. Wood oA a pony, and I can usfely say I never mounted quicker in my life. We were now on our way baok to Delhi again, but the Sepoy was very uneasy regarding us, and aid after some lttle distance 'on our journoy that he 'wa afAid we should be deteed,avnd thought Itbeat we should dismount and find ourw aissbest wee could to KurnauL We therefore dis_ mounted, and led our sick man back to the place when the Sepoy found us; here wo rested for alittle wile, and 'we then went on our way again. We rmached a village about 4 o'clock a.1n the next mofning, and sat-down under a tree los to the vilage. At daybreak we saw the em i going to their 'work, uad, as it was a Bindoo vi'Uage, we were not afraid to venture to it. We 'were met !y an old | man, who took us into the village, and badbe rest quite. quietly as no harm would befall us there. Durlng that day wer met with the utmost kdndness from this man, 'who gave us bread and milk for the doctor: and had water heated to wash the doctor's wound. A Brihmin vwholived in an adjoining village heard we were taking shelter in a villsge next to his own, and he came to secus, bringing hundreds of his villageis with him to see us likewise; he Insisted on making the doctor a wooden pipe to drink his milk through, I as no sooner than he took nourishment it ran outside his face, and most successfullydid he make the pipe, for the doctor found it a great benefit. This irahmin gave us the information that another doctor was in his village, and from his description of him we immediately concluded that it waIsDr. Batson of the 74th IRegi. mient. Wesent him a message asking him to come, it posible, and remove some portion of the jaw, which was causing great pain and annoyance to Dr. Wood. He senat word back, according to the Brahmin' aecomunt, that he had no clothes, and could not appear before ladles, but sent some Epsom salts and a wineglas to the doctor. We told the Brahmin that, aB the old man of the village had promised us shelter for that night, one of us would go and see him In the morning. Mrs. Wood accordingly went, while I remained with the doctor; but when she reaohed the village,, which 'was not more than a quarter of a mile dlstant, she was told by the villagers that ho had left. The old maa who had protected us the day before was fearfu!-'+f allowing us to again enter his village leat the Delhi Sipoys should I hear of bis secreting us, in vhioh cae in all probability his village would have been put in flames by them, and there fore toldustogo away as quickly as po;ible. It asa frlghtfullybhot day, with a bung-lnd, and we felt qnite unequal to proceed on our journey, and begged of another i n of the s"me vilago to take cmw of M for that day. He promised he would, and bade us follow him, which we very quiocly did; we soon found ourselves in a moet dismal room with one door and no windows; he brought us two beds, and told us to go to deep. We bad only been insde the room about half an hour when about 150 Mus- sulmans came to the door with stleks, tulwars, and other i rude weapons, and commenced fighting among themselves. Their evident wish was to murder us, for the Brahmin whom I before mentioned, begged of us to leave the vilage there and then, and In so great a hurry were they to get quit of ui that they would not allowus timne to fll our'water vesseL Although we had been from Dll some five days, yet we were not more than about ten miles on our journey. We left "il place about 10 o'clock in the morning, and, greAt as was tbe heat, we travelled some five miles that day. We arrived at anothervillge about 2dclock the same afternoon andteceived the greatest kindness from most of thoseo belonging to the vllage. We were not rermitted to enter' theo vilage, and therefore sat in theverandah of on, of the 1 huSs built for the oolies of the engineer's deparvneun os publio works.

We passed a most comfortable night at this place, and again set out on the morning of the - 18th. We reched another village about 6 o'clock that morning, and the working men, seeing 'what dificulty we had in getting the doctor along, volunteered to caary him from illage to Illage, ,where they could be relieved of- their burden. This was a most kind offer, and was most-gladly accepted by us. We then set out again, and we rahed a place called Nowswowie at about 8 'clock in the afternoon of the same day, completing a distapoe of 20 miles in those few hou,. I kuow not how we mapaged it, forthe road was a most rough one, and our feet were literally studded with thorns. We found a Coipany's servant at Ghursowlie, who provided s with food and beds. We set out next morning to LIrsowlie, a ditanoe Of about 22 miles from KurnauL We were frightfully burnt from the scorching sut and fiery 'wind, And as I had had no covering for my head all these days I at times fancie4 my brain was affected I begged of the man inautho. rity at Ghursowlie before starting to give me apiece of cloth of soWns kind, whica he did. This I made dripping wet and bound it round my temples. We then all started off to Lursowlie. major Paterson and I were on horses, and Ms Wood and Mr. Peile were on mules. The doctor was pro. vided -ith a bed, and so wo made our appearance at tha latter place. We here met with:more Company's servants; these men were very kind, asnd seeing us so badly clad gave us more clothes. We remained at Lursowlie the whole of that ight and the next day, but we were in a sad state of mind from not receiving any answer to our request for assistnce. Our minds were, however, greatly relieved by hearing the sound of the coachman's horse abot 4 p.m. the next day. We had nothing to pack ap, and no sooner had the " shigeam," for so it is caled, arrived, than we had talcen our seats. The Puttealah Raja had sent out cavalry to escort us into Kurnaul, sboal 40 horsemen, and a pretty appearance they had. They weie mounted on beautiful horsea and were dressed in the gayest of colours. We arrived at Kurnaul that eight at about r p.m., and wrere most kindly received by Mr. ligby, of the Engineers' Department. We were in. formed on our arrival at Kuruani that the force would all meet at j place, and would manrch on Delhi in about a fortn1ght. The roads being still most unafe we were advised to remain at Km-nnl till the regiments were moving downwards, when we would proceed to the bills. All this time I knew not where my dear c'hlld was, further than that the peoplwith whoma he went had reached Meerutin safety. lere wAs 11o way of sending a letter by d4k, and theretore I paid a Brahmln 20 rupees to go to Meerut with a letter froma me to the ldy and gentlemau wyho took charge - of my child. The Brahmnin dressed himself as a native priest, -and took my letter quite safely, and brought roe back an nswer, saying that my little boy was quite safe? and thai ho reached Meerut on the evening of the 12th at sunset; the roads were too dangerous to admit of his being brought to rue, and therefore for safetysake I was oompelled to let hia remain there, atI which placa be still is, and from -what. I hear from tbe chaplain at -Meerut, he is very well and happy, which is agreat comfort to me. We had onlybeen at Kuruaul Sfew idaYs when thie Comnzander-in-Chlef, the Hon. George Ason, died from the effects of cholera; he was takei ill, I believe, at about 10 o'clock on the night of the 26th of Alay, and was a corpse by 4 o'clock on the morn. ing of thi 28th; he was buriedthat same evening at sunst. I do not lp;ow why it was, but he ws laid in his grave witisout a; riliary honour. . We st4rted In two dAk cr. -ges on the 23th at abo.t 5 o'clock pm., and arrIved at b p ala called Peeplee..

The Snailwsopenedandthe letters ckttered ibout. Thepo3t. man was robbed of the money le hid upon his person, and then tied to a tree. He was discovered asd released about two hours afterwards, and upon information being given at Ban Rogue some of the Civil Guards were sent in pursu of the robbers." The Royal mail steampacket Tanar, with the Australian mails o} the 12th from Southainpton, passed the garrison it Gibraltar on the 17that 3 30 p.m. By thsb Colombo a large number of the British fugitives from India h«ve arrived home the total number oi her po& sengersbWlng 76 first clas, 52 sepond$ and 56 children. A ist of their nmmes was published In 27ie imes of yesterday, the only dditi6ns being from WUlt. Among the pasdea. gers theke aro a few who hate eaped narrowly with their lives, but the great majority of them are from Calcutta, Bombay, and other districti hot Immediately oonnected with the- mutiny. One lady was on board who 'ucceeded in rnallng her escape from Delhi with our children and a favourite dog, but she could glean no jntelligence of the fate of her husband. Another of 6e ladies had to swim aeross a river; and athlrd secreted herrelf in the jungle, by these 3neans maanging to elude the vigllano of the fiendg who tlirstecdfor their blood and-who. had so ntlessly masasrerd the less fortunate Europeans.

A young lady 'wo had been married but a month, and who went oat In the Colombo on her ontward voyage, Wa ent home again from Suez, her husband's regiment havlng been ordered to join the army in Bengal, aDd she bas returned in: the same steamer to England, The statements of such of the passengers as we had the opportunity of conversdng with more than confirm the detIls which have been publish&eaf the diustng barbarlties perpeirte4 by, tgio Sepoy mutinerar spon ttheir haphem vic. mg. p wltSA difficulty, howaever, nything could be fleaned from them, sO loth 'were thoy to talk about the horrors from which they ha providentialy eaped, and so rejoiced-did they seem at once more lookingupon the peace ful sbores of Old England. All the passengers report wrell of -the treatment which the fugtives received from the merchants and residents at Calcutta, who paid every poedble attention to their respective wants, and supplied them with money to send them on to Eigland to their friends. The prevallg impression seemed to be that the people at bome have, even now, nothing like a conrrc notion of the extent and charbter of the matiny. Immediately on the arrival of the Colombo in the river a letter was placed in Captain Field's hands from the Peninsular and Oriental Company, on the part of the Relief Fund Committee, auihorizing him to render money or other assistanoe to any of the pa e3ngers who might stand in need of it. During the morning the Lady Mayoress, who had come down from London, accompanied by Mr. Under-Sheriff Anderton, visited the Colombo, together with the Mayor of Southampton (Mr. J. White), the Town Clerk (Mr. C. E. Deacon), and the local committee appointed for the purpose, with a view of attending to any cae of distress, but we were gratified at hearing, on their return, that there was no need for their benevolent interposition on this oocaslon. Admiral Sir Stephen Lushington, sent down by the Lord Mayor and the London committee, was in Southampton yesenday, and met the local committee to confer with them relative to the disposition of relief to any of the distressed fngitivec who may arrive at this port. The arrival of the Colombo's passengers excied great interest, and the docks were full of people anxiously looking o i throughont the morning. Every faciity for the expedi. tiodslanding of the passengers was provided by Messrs. Hedger and Levy, the dock of cials; and the officers of Customs also did their best to effect thesame object in reference to the clearance of their baggage. It was faully expected that the Board of Customs in London would have forwarded an order to the officials at this port to expedite the clearance of baggage as much as possible, similar to that issued during the Russian war; and it is to be hoped that public attention having now been called tQ the matter, no delay will take place in the promulgation of such an order, go that the same facilities that were afforded to passengers who arrived here from Russian territories may, during a somewhat parallel crisis, be extended to those returning from India. It is expected that the next steamer, the Indus, due here on the 4th proximo, will bring home 200 women and children.

OnWedunesday afternoon a meeting was beld in the Mer. chantsWhall, Glasgow, for the purpose of originating a subscription on behalf of the sufferers by the Jindan mutinies. Itwzas attended by the most inuluential clases of the dty The Lord Provost was accompanied to the platform by Si Archibald Alison, the historian, Sir E. Colbrooke, MLP., 3r. DaIglish, XP., Sir J. Anderson, LM., Sir James Campbell, Mfr. Tennant, of St. Iollox; Mr. Merry, late M.P. for Fal. ldrk; the magistrates, and several of the city clergy. Sir A. AiSoN mnoved the first resolution. Be said,Hardly three years have elapsed sinoe we were assembled in this hall to set on loot a subscription which was to testify to the world the sense we entertained of the services of our Crimean heroes. The hour in which we then met annot be looked back to without feelings of emotion even at this time, for on the morning of that very day news had arrived of the splendid charge at Balaklava, and at the momient we were assembled was fought in the Crimea the immortal battle of Inkermann. Well and nobly did the citizens of Glasgow then rpond to the call made on their ptriotium and their liberality; for 45,0004 was raised in tg city and Its neighbourhood for relief of the snuerers, and Glasgow took its place next to London in the scale of British generosity. But urgent as was the necesstty which then existed for relef to the sufferers, pressing as was the call upon the charity and beneficence of our countrymen, it was as nothing to that which now exists. Then war was waged far from our own shores; its chief horrors were known only to our enemies, and the ruins of Sebastopol attest to this day what those horrors were. We had then to relieve only the widows and orphans of the warriors who had fallen in the conflict, but now the case is very different. War in its most L'rrible and appalling form has now approached onr own doininions, the richest provinces of our empire have beeu devastated by the horrors at once of civil strife and servile revolt, and they have reached not only the armed warrior bat the pacUio citizen. I wll not harrow up your feelings by repeating in this place the hoartrending accounts which have thrilled the whole civilized world of the sufferings of our countrymen and countrywomen in Inoia. I 'vish rather to impress upon this meeting, and through it, if possible, upon the oountry, that this revolt wras as njustifiable in its origin as it his been atrocious in its prdgress. Itis in vain to speak of the gteasedcartnidges; the revolt was organized by the Mahomeudns years before the greased cartridges were heard of. The greased cartridge was a mere device to delude the Sepoys. We must not oonfound the military mutiny of the Briamins and MahomedsIL with the glorious efforts-with some of which all must sympathize-of patriotic virtue, in other countries and in former days, for nationsl inde. pendence. The revolt has in no sense been a naional movement; It was undertaken for no national purpose; ev n yet it is not joined in, or sympathized with, by t'he grat body of the people. It is the work of a licentious soldiery, spoiled by indulgence, panting for rapine, and teeming with lust, and of thoeslone. It has all the features l auch an outbreak of the worst passions of humanity. Its first step was to liberate 11,000 ruffians, In different plsees, from prison; its next, to disbonour and massacre all tbe wom en lwho had surr redonthefaithof capitulation; its last, to toss infants in the air and catch them on the pcints of bayonets. I read of no such exploits as these in the annah of Tell, of Alfred, of Wallace, or Bruce. I read in thaem of many victories gained in the field, of many stugles suttained in the breach, but of no massacring of women or children in the dungoou. I do not stand here to justify .1l the acts of ourIndian Adminitation. Someof theor may be open to objection, and will be fitly dealt with by history, But that our Govcrnamen,uponthe whole, hasbeesa blesing to Bindosta-mubjeesit has ithbeen in all ages to foreign rule, and never capable either oi self-government or selfdefence-and that its overthrow would be the greatest sniiortine which eould befal its inhabitants hx dec2ivelyproved by the facts that the industrial produces of tbe country have been ixcreased 70 per cent, since it feU under British prOtection; that our exports to it now esceed 10,000,000. a.year, quadruple what they were isA 18C0 , and that our rle over it has hitherto beh. maintained by less, on an average, than 40.00 European- troops of every denomination, distant 1V,G miles fr.,m Great Britain, who were, till this outheeak occUrrsd, willingly obeyed by 180,000,000 Asiatica, Such facts are utterly inconsistent with any other supposi. tiov but that it has ruled in the interests and Ation s or tbe great body of the people.

I.RELAND. GALWAY ELEOTIOl INQUIJY. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPOND3iT.) DUBLIN, THuRSDAy MopUuG. ine comnuissonersappointed byHerMajesty'swarrant to inquire into the alleged existence of corrupt practices at the elections for the town of Galway will proceed to execute their functions on the 29th of the present month. The objects and powers of the commission are thus defined:- " The inquiry is instituted under the Act 15th and 16th of Victoria, c. 57, and is the first instance in which that enactment has been applied in Ireland. For the pur. pose of enabling the commissioners effectually to carry on the investigation, they have been invested by the Legislature with very ample powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and to enforce the discovery of truth. They are empowered to require the attendance of every person whose evidence they may deem material, and by adopting the proceedings pointed out in the statute the penalty of imprisonment under attachment can be inflicted on the party absent. It is also to be observed that, as these comnmissions are the result of a previous inqu5iy before a Parliamentary committee, the names of all persons implicated in any objectionable transactions are known, so that nothicg is reallygained by tperson absentinghimself. Onthecontrary, it s the intereat of any person implicated to come forward as a witness, as the Act enables the commissioners to protect and indemnify the witness from all legal consequences of his acts by giving the witness a certificate that he has made a true disclosure touching all things on which he has been examined. The ninth section of the Act (omitting formal terms) provides that every person who haa been engaged in any corrupt practices at or connected with any election, and who is examined as a witness and gives evay dence touching such corrupt practices before the commit. sioners, and who upon such examination makeea true discovery to the best of his knowledge touching all things on which he is so examined, shall be freed from all penal actions, forfeitures, punishments, disabilities, and incapa. cities, and all criminal prosecutions to which he may bave been or may become liable at the suit of Her Majesty or any other person; and no person ahall be excused from answering any question put by such commissioners on the ground tbat the answerwill tnd to oriminate such person. It will thusbeeseenthatawit. ness, however implicated, can by giving his evidence candidly protect himself from all evil consequences ; whereas if he is not examined, or, being examined, shall not deserve and obtain from the commisioners a certificate, he is left open to a prosecution for his acts, which will inevitably be directed by the House of Commons on the coming in of the report of the commissioners, The commissioners can also a journ as often and as long as they choose, and can make special reports from time to time, and report matters spcially to the Queen and House of Commons; so that the result i, no witneas by going away can evade the commissioners, as if he is not there at one time they can resume the inquiry at another. The witnesses will be allowed for their time according to the Treasury scale. The consequenoe of all these provisions has been that a number of commissions issued in England have worked most satisfactorily, and those who told the truth have obtained their certificates of indemnity, while those who either did not attend, or, having attended, gave their evidenoe uncandidly, and so lost the protection of the commissioners' certificate, have been reported to the Honse of Commons, and dealt with according as their cases deserved." The commissioners are Mr. John Thomas Bl, Q.C., and L.L.D., moderate Conservative (and not Mr. John Ball, the late Under-Secretary, as erroneously stated); Mr. John Leahy, and Mr. Piers Franci White, barristers and Liberals. TEE lRLSl SBPOYS. One or two of the provincial organs of the Sepoys having been again this week championing the cause of their Indian allies, the Belfast Mercury, a Liberal Protestant journal, and by no means hostile to the Roman Catholic body at large, comes to the unwelcome conclusion that the vile sentiments of these writers are shared by a considerable number of the Roman Catholic population. This, however, is an overstrained charge. Sepoy demonries may, and probably do, find favour in the eyes of a few dozen of scamps in Dublin and Tipperary, but beyond those narrow limits there is no sympathy or affection. The days of Irish treason have long died out, and another generation at least must arise before the wicked follies of 1848 will be tolerated by any "considerable number of the Roman Catholc population." The Mercury thus pu:ts the question:- " On what other supposition can we account for the fact that they are put forward, week after week, by a large portion of the exclusively Roman Catholic journails ? The proprietors of those prints have too keen a sense of their own pecuniary interests to adopt a course otherwise than pleasing to the great bulk of their subsoribers. While, therefore, such meetings as that held in Carrick-on-Suir, and such a repudiation of Sepoyism as the Freemaon so creditably manifests, prove that there exists among the respectable Roman Catholics a true, loyal, and manly feeling on the subject, it is utterly impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that among the Roman Catholics of Ireland as a body such a feeling is not shared. When we find journals in various counties giving expression to the most atrocious sentiments, and professing to do so as the representatives of true Roman Catholic feeling, how can we help belleving them as long as they are permitted to exist by those on whose support they can alone rely? Of late years many things have ocecrred to bring Roman Catholics into disodour. Affecting to be the warm advocates of civil and religions liberty, they have proved themselves on several memorable occasions to be the veriest slaves of the worst description of tyranny. They howl afeer an unrighteous ascendancy is this country, they desire to destroy all liberty that is inconsstent wih their own aggressive Policy, and tney make no secret of their ardent hope that Ireland may revolt like India- that every man, woman, and chUd not of their own creed and policy may besubjectedtothesame treatment that Sepoy barbarians inflicted on our brethren In India. There can be no mistake now upon this subject. The evidence is too clear, toounequivocaL topermit a doubt. Is it not, then, full time for such of the Roman Catholics as do not participaite in the vile pocy expressed by s^uch miscreants, to adopt; some efficient means to disasociate themselves from those who proless to represent their opinions truly-to reflect their feelings faithfully ?" THE CATTLE DISESE. A letter from Miltown, in the county of Kerry, and published in the Tralee Chronicle of yesterday, says:- 5 I am sorry to have to lnform you that the cattle disease has made its appearance here for some time past, and is on the increase. ;some farmers have lost as many as 12 or 14 head of cattle. Several others who purehased dry cattle in the early part of the year sold them all off at the late fairs, and at a considerable lose." THE FUNDS. Three per Cent.

The Bmperor of the French, -with a magnanimity worthy of his high postion, has generously contrlbuted the sum of 1>0004 - Her Most Gracions Majety the Queen, ever sensitively live to the sufferings of her umbjects, has also contributed the sum of 1,000o. and I am plessed to say that the papers of this morning announce the welcome and gratifying fact that the Sultan. of Turkey has also contributed the munificent donation of 10001. towards the Relief Fund. (Loud cheers.) The atrocities detailed to us as having been committed by the Sepoys pnor the Europeana in india araunpaalleledlin the annals of crme And in the darkest pages of history. The heart sick-ens at the very idea of the enormities and barbarities that have there been perpetrated, (Hear, hear.) My Lord Mfayor, it is under taese Appalling and unfortunate. circumstanoes that I haveo thought it my duty to request that this Court will aid your Lordship's efforts by contributing the sum of 5001. towards that fund which Is DowbeingvaLsedforthepurposeofalevitaittheunfortunate distresses-distreses which really cannot be magnified-of our fellow-crextareeanow at Calcutta, wo have been laced there by circumstances over which they had no controlt ...nd who have been betrayed by the treacherous and faitbles soldiery of Bengal. (Hear, hear.) The Government are sending a force there whose timely arrival will, I trust, relieve those gallant and heroic bands now pert up in fortresses and citadels, anxiously awaiting that succour and relicE which may save their lives, and eventually enable them to reach in safety the shores of their native country. (Loud cheering) I am perfectly sure-I hope and trust at least-that no politicel feeling will be imported into the oonsideration of this matter, which is purely one of charit;y, and charity of such a nature that it is our bounden duty, i n y humble opinion, to exercise it. It is with great satisfaction I heard that your Lordaiup has issaed a circular to the chief magistrate of overy county and city, as well as to the bishop of every diocess, and that your appeal on behalf of yoar suffering fellow-countrymen has been most nobly responded to. (Cheers.) I trust tbat this motion will meet with the approbation of the Court, and that it will be carried nanimously. Iam sure thrt, looking at the resources*of the corporatio7, the suima I have named will not be considered too large. I am pleased to think that a gentleman who gave notico of a motion askin for a larger amount has withdrawn it because the proposed grant, if given unanimously, will be much more gracous than if it were attended with anything like an appearance of opposition. (Loud cheering.) Mr. WOOLTOP.TON (who had withdrawn from the paper of business a notice of motion for 1,0001. towards the elief Fund) said he was glad to be permitted the grateful opwrtunity of seconding the motion of the gentleman who had just sat down. if that motion did not give as much as he could desire in a financal point of view, It showed that the corporation were governed by a spirit of prudence which existed in this great commercial metropolis, and which made their gifts largely belbw what the increasing wishes of their hearts would desire to see exhibited. Upon those grounds alone it was that the corporation were about to vote unanimosly a sunm that would enable them in the event of future exigencies occurring to respond to a supplementary calL It was almost obtrnsive to enter into any details (hear, hear)-into the various circumstances that had occurred from the first fatal terrible hour when the brother of the Lord Mayor became the first victim of one of the most terrible conspiracies that ever overwhelmed a nation until the time he (Mr. Wooltorton) was speaking. A resolution of character had been exhibited, holding out the AngloSaxon as an example to the world. Confident In the rectitude of his podition, he was enabled in the hour of trial and of tribulation to stand erect against hordes of miscreants and to lay down his life after so brilliant an example as has been set by the late gallant Lieutenant-Colonel iniis, who had fallen upon the altar of hiR o0untry. (Cries of " Question, question l") He believed that they had not yet reached the climax or critical point at which the rebellon would exhibit itself. They had on the arrival of every mail been told that the great culminating point had been passed. The daily journals had told them four months ince that the next mail would communicate the intelligence that the day of retrlbu. tion had arrived, and that Britain's standard was again to be seen floating in the capital of the Mogul empire ! Hav. ing received by every mail long and particular accounts of what had been gOIng on in India, he was confident that increased cautiov, activity, and energy were required in the administration of affairs in India. Mr. HANs.1Ns said that lately a very serious question - had wrisen as to the state of the corporation funds, and he thought that the consideration of the present motion should be postponed until the report of the Special Revenue Committee was in thehands of the Court. (Laughter.) Mr. Deputy HOLT said he trusted that the 5001. now about 'o be subscribed to the fund would only be considered in tbelight of afirstinstalment. He was sure that the motion would be carried unanimously. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BEss.s salid there was a more important question connected with the sabject under discussion than the mere matter of money. He was not at all satisfied with the precautions taken by the Government of India, seeing that the premonitory symptoms of the rebellion had extended over so many years. The Government of India had no business ta leave the great fortress of Delhi to be protected by a corporal's guard. Re wanted to know what were the pains and penalties to be attached to the fact of only 80 men having been left to protect the fortress of Cawvnpore? He did not wish to disturb the uantimity of feeling, but was anxious that the world should know that they wecre thinking people, and did not intend to subscribe money ad t.nfins.furn Mr.TAYLOR SIid he most gladly and cheerfully supported the motion. The motion was then put, and carried nem. con. amid cheering. THE MrROPOLTAIT CATIIE-MARDKET. The REsmsncBRNC formally laid upon the table some 'Acts of Parliament which recently pased, one of which was the Metropolltan Mrarkets Improvement Act, nuon which, Mr. TAYLOW (Chairman of the Markets Improvement Cominittce) said the corporation had now the power of letting slAughterhouses at the new market for a period of seven years, although originally the Government Act had confined their lettings to 12 months. They had also the privilege of letting the taverns and publicbouses for periods of 21 years. They had obtained a very considerable privilege in respect to the increase of tolls, and althougb this had not been carried oat to the extent the committee desired, the increase would be something like 2,5001 a year. (Hear, hear.) They had also obtained what might be considered a boon, the letting for a period of S0 years the frontages coloured red on the plan he pro. auced. If the land were let to persons to build upon it wouald yield a large sum per annum, and the reversion of the prorty would fall into the hands of the corporation at the en of 80 years, care being taken not to part with the .ee, bht to retain the freehold in the corporation, so that the ground might be made available at any future time for the enlargement of the market. He moved that the Act be referred to the Markets Improvement Committee to carry out. Mr. Deputy HARnISON apprehended that the Court would not authorize any committee to carry the provisions of the Act into effect without reportig their proceedings to the Court. He suggested that the words "subject to the approval of the Court" should be added to the motion. (Hear, Alderman Wrn-I tbink the committee ought to oome here for the approval by the Court of their proceedings. Mr. WooLToRTON said he had heard complaints made by salesmen of the operation of the existing by-laws, and he thought the Court ought to hAve the power of superseding irregularities. Alderman WIRn.-T beg to ask the Remembrancer what are the powers of the committee under the Act-whether or not they are bound to report their proceedings to the The REME0R BANCM -With respect to the granting of anay leases, they must undoubtedly come before the Court for their approvaL.

MIDDLESEX ty , Scpt 24, (Bfore- Mr. BO-xm.) Jeremiah Donovan, 40, wau Indlcted for assulting Wil. 1lam Payne, a police-constable, in the execution of his duty. The condable was on duty at the east-end on the morning of the 12th inst., and desid the prisoner and A woman he was qurelng with to go ay and bo i. The grisoner crossedthe road nd the constdble uoen b, ad not toceeded far, when the Irisoner feUled him to the groiind Yaqblow with a piece o wood, which cut his head and rendered him insensible. The prisoner was found Guily, and sentenoed to six months' hard labour. John Crowther, 25, costermoonger, was indicted for tn. Iolwfuly assaulting Eziel Lumbkin and others, constables of the lice force, In the execution of their duty. Mr. orry prosected. It appeared that the risoner had long been a terror to the neighbourhood of ing's-cross, and was frequentl] in custod for asslts upon women ana the police. One ay he and some others were creafng a great noise and dis. turbanoa, and Lmnbldn, the conasale on duty, interposed, when the prisoner assaulted him in a most savage manner. Other oonstables came to his aid, and they were also assaulted violently, and the prisoner seized one by the hand and bit one of the fLnger -o the bone, leaviDg five distincti teeth marks and causg excruciating pain. This sinthe cell at the sation-house. The,prisoner, howlig in * most hideous manner, pleaded drunkenness as his excuse The jury found him Guily. The officers proed seven formeroonvictions for assaulting thepolice against theprisoner, besidesothers forassaults upon women. Thee were two summonses out aainst him when he was apprehended. Mr. BODKIN sad the prisoner appeared to be more of the nature of a fetocLoa dog or wild beast than a human being. He sentenced him to be kept to hard labour for one year, The.pfrsoner clung to the dock rilings, and was with difficulty removed. en taken below he ws so violent that it took three sawart-turnkeys to handcuff him. James Tapping, 24, ws indicted lor assaulting Abel Sims, also a po,lioe-constable, in the execution of his duty. The prosecutor was on duty on the morning of the 14th in George-street, Christchuxcl when he saw a woman lying in the doorway of a brothel drunk, and her clothes in disordor. The prisoner came out of the house, and the constable asked him why the woman was allowed to lie there in such an Indecent manner. He made use of some ver foul angua in reply, and sad he'd let him know h.'s pay him out for gettin two of his associates sent to prison, and struck him a violent blow over the eye, and gave htm a kick on the kneecap, which disabled him. The constable drew his staff, but the prisoner got hold of it, and another constable comingup threw him down and wrested. it from him. The prosecutor's knee waS so injured thathe had not been on duty since. The prisoner admitted one blow, but urged that the case had been greatly exag;erated. The jury found him Guilty, and he ws sentenced to hard labour for one year. John Barren, who was found guilty on Wednesday of stealing a watch, and who appeared to have carried on a regular trade of robbing watchmakers and jewellers, was brought up for judgment. Three convictions, Hummary, were proved against himt, and the Court pased a eentence of four years' penal servitude. iTwo prostitutes, named Ebrington and Mahoney, were indicted for stealing a watch and other articles value Sl., the property of Joseph Lee The prosecutor, a sailor just ashore, met the prisoner Mahoney in Ratcliff-highway, and she asked him to have something to drink. He went with her to a house in Angelgardens, not the tmost appropriate name for such a place, where she gave him some liquor, after taking which he became insensible and was robbed of his watch and all his clothes. Both prisoners wero proved to have been engaged in disposing of the property. Mahoney pleaded " Guilty." MIr. IvcA.LFz; addressed the jury on behalf of Ebringten, but a verdict of Guilty was returned. Mr. RIBTON, who was counsel for the prosecution, comnplained of the negligent manner in whick the evidence was wnttenin the depositions. According to the evidence on the depositions the tWo Women were together when the prosecutor was first asked to drink. What the prosecutor swore was that Mahoney *as alone so there ought to have been a count for receiving against Ebrington, as she had pawned some of the articles. The omission of such a count was not attributable, therefore, to the indictmentoffice here, but such carelessness very often led to great inconvenience and sometimes injustice. The prisonersvere each sentenced to 12 months' hard labour. ames Williams, a ticket-of-leave man, was convicted bf stealing a pair of boots. There were other charges against him. The prisoner was eentenced to seven years' transportation in 1852, and had been at liberty on a ticket of leave 28 months, part of which time he had been working hard for a livlng. He met a eonstable by whom his bad character before conviction wu well known, and he asked him not to inform his employers that he had been convicted, and the constable said he certainly should not if he behaved well, and he kept his word. The oJficer was Potter, 212 K. The prisoner took to drinking, and then again resorted to thieving, Mr. BoDN1m, after well considering the case, and making a number of inquiries, sid he thought a senterce of 12 months' hard labour would satisfy the ends of justice.

Colonel Deverell, was near the Equator on the 11th of July, having had a good passage Eo far in the ship Palmerston, for Sydney. The Cleopatra steamship, with the 23d Royal Welsh Fusileers on board, arrived, all well, at Ascension, on the way to India, oni the lAth of July. The Ireland steamship left Portsmouth yesterdar with thie following officers and troops for Kurrachee:-Majr,r Peyton, Captains Cloveland, Rhodes, Batt, and Ellerraan; Lieu. tenants Fresson, Gardiner, Kiay, Lloyd, J nes, Lewis, Blackett, Walker, and Brett ;OEnmigns Wmoadward, West, Smith, aud Stewart; Assistant-Surgeon Beattie, 20 sergeants, 7 drmnmers, 19 corporals, and T, privates of the %sth Regiment. The Ireland msiled from Spithead at halfpast 2 p.m. The Chesape.ake, 51, screw Trigate, Captain Watson, C.B., -left Spithead yesterday afternoon fo. Calcutta. Lieutenant-Colonel C. Elmhirst, who has been appointed to the command of the third battalion recently formed at Chatham garrison, has joined the Provisional Battalion, and taken up his appointment. The Third Dep6t- Battalion will be quatered in the huts at Prince Henry's bastion, and Brompton barranks. Lientenant T. Lloyd, 3!ith Regiment, and Captain A. J. (9. Rutherford, 70th Regiment, havo joined their respective dept battalions at Chatham. Major LMortimer Adye, R.A., has been appointed reerciting officer for the Royal Artilery in the south-west district. Yesterday the head-quarters, consisting of the A and E troops, of the 7th Dragoon Guards, accompanied by their band, arrived at Chatham from Sheffield, under orders to joln the troops of that regiment quartered at Can. terbury. The head-quarters were under the command of Captain A. R. G.Costello and Lieutenant and Adjutant D. Scotland, and numbered 120 horses and men. A detachment of the 7th Dragoon Guards, consisting of the D and F troops, numbering 80 men and 103 horses, left Chatham yesterday for Canterbury, accompanied by the following officers :-Captain T. E. Dowbiggin, Lieutenant and RtidingMaster Blinkhorn, Lieutenant J. V. Cleland, Cornet W. D. Wentworth, and Cornet R. E. Echalaz. The 7th Dragoon Guards, which number upwards of 500 men, are under orders to embark at Oravesend on the 2d of October, on board the Soutthampton, for India. Colonel Hogart, 7th Hussars, left London yesterday, and proceeds to India by the overland route to meet his regiment at Calcutta. In the Quebec Gaette of Sept. 8 we read " Yesterday morning the left wing of the 39th Regiment arrived hero from Montreal in the steamer Quebec, and this morning the head-quarters arrived in the Canadian. On arrival the respective divisions marched up to the citadel barracke, where they are to be quartered." The left wing of the 9th Regiment, under command of Major Bethune, arrived in Montreal on Monday evening, Scptember 7, in the Upper Canada steamer. They number as follows:-l field officer, 3 captains, 17 subalterns, 1 staff, 27 sergeants, 17 drummers, 339 rank and file, 26 women, and 32 children. The right wing was expected on the following day. Recruits are daily reaching the head-quarters of the Artillery at Woolwich from tho various provincial stations, and after being passed are forthwith equipped and put through the necessary drills for foreign service. Yesterday sov:-al parties arrived at Woolwich for presentation from York, Ipswlch, Watford, St. Alban's, Portsmouth, and some other localities appointed as recruiting stations of the corps. Numbers are rejected as being below the registered stature five feet four inches being the lowest standard for admission to the4Royal Artilery. Brevet-Major Ward's A troop of Royal Horse Artillery, at Woolwich, has been medically inspected for service in India. The completion of the screw steam ship Edgar, 91, al Woolwich, is ordered by the Lords of the Admiraliy to b pushed forward, so as to commence the Anson and two other 50-gun frigates, with as much despatch as possible The Edgar Is expected to be launched about April next.

This regiment is upwards of 1,000 strong. The Dnmfries Militia will assemble for embodiment on the 1st of October next. The 4th Royal Lancashire Light Lifantry Militia assembled at Warrlngton yesterday for permanent duty, and mustered 36 officers and 910 men, and, as numbers are hourly arriving, it is expected that in a few days the full strength (1,240 men) will have joined. Oa Monday the North Down Rifles mustered for embosdiment at Newtownards. Although only a week's notice had been given, and the men were necessarily scattered-some in Scotland and others in various parts of Ireland, following their various callings-still, at the first roll-call on Monday 410 men answered to their names. Their appearance was highly creditable, and such as naturally elicited the commendation of their Colonel, the Marquis of Londonderry. All the officers were present. The South Downs were also embodied on Monday last at Hillsborough, when the attendanc! at roll-call was highly satisfactory.
TLE SETANDA RD IEIGHT FOR THB ARMY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Is there any sound reason why a man of 5 feet 4 inches should be rejected as unfit for Her MIajesty's service? In the Anglo-Swiss Legion, 2,100 of whom were quartered in Smyrna during the late war, men were enrolled at the low standard of 5 feet 2i inches. The average height of course exceeded this. Their appearance on parade, as regards size and strength, was pronounced by many comnpetent judges fully equal to that of our line regiments. In marching powers and endurance of fatigue they were certainly not to be surpassed by our beat troops. Their breadth of shoulders and depth of chest took our arnmy contractors by surprise. I think it may be laid down as a general rule that a well-framed little man can go through continuous hard work for a longer period than an equally well proportioned big man, It is almost a proverb that many a little frame encloses a big heart. The Enfield rifle, some pounds lighter than "Brown PYas," certainly does not lose its formidable powers in the hands of a man of 5 feet 4 inches. WNhy is not the standard, then, lowered ? Our small army is going off, regiment after regiment, to the East. We have no reserve. Recruits are coming in, but not rapidly enough to fill up the probable casualties of Eastern service, certainly niot to provide a new army. Every day many -good men and true are turned away by the recruiting sergeant on a matter of Inches. Thle splendid infantry that rolled back the tide of invasion from the suiny homes of "la belle France," that carried Napoleon's eagles in victory over a continent, -was mainily composed of men who, by the present regulations, would be rejected by the Briti.h recruiting officer. Let the standard be lowered two inches. Let a corps of 5,000 be formed from these hitherto rejected volunteers for service in India. Let them be lightly equipped and clad. Let them be offlicered by men specially distingilshed for their powers of organization. Let them have a proper quota of light active horsemen, picked men, armed with sharp sabres and good revolvers,-say two regiments of 500 men each. Furniah thetn with the usual complement of artillery. Place a good man at their head. England, once stlch in experirent made, will have no more occasion for foreigners to fight her battles. I have the honour to be. Sir, your obedient gervanf EXPECTANS, TO THE EDITOR OF TaE TIMES. Sir,-I live in an agricultural district, and, knowing that there are mauy active young mlen ont of work who, I believe, would enlist if they could only see the recruiting sergeant, I requested a sergeant frorn a neighbouring town to pay my neighbourhtood a visit. He did so, and he went to a fair where he could have got as many as 30 or 40 stout growing lads, of the proper age, but not quite up to the standard of 5ft. bin. These young feUows would soon grow tall enough, after they had been well driled and well fed. I was in hopes the red tape-system was almost exploded, biV it does inot look like iL. z our obedient servant. A R5TIPFD OFFICER
VC,LUNTBEBR CORPS. TO THE EDITORw OF THE TIMES. Sir,-T);e public prinsut teem wfit;h urgent proposaln that voh &nteer corps shall imrtmediately beu rAisod for sernice in India. At the same moment the recruiting segrgents are 2noeting with but very mnoderato succoss, a bontity 4 21. per man and a freo kit collectitig omarcoly 1,000 men a-week from all Eugland. The explanation of this apparent womnialy is tket the classes who proposo to forni tbeso voluti3r corps justly consider thomancves too good to enter the army as private soldim oion '>te humiiMatitg and hopeleus conditions which tho prchaseo system entbrces upon incn without mnmey in the B3ritsh service. I hope that before the Minister of W- ,aserionsly entertains any of theae propoeals he wilt maturely consider how tlhey are likely to work, for nothing is more destructive of puiblic 'confideace at such a crisis as this than the hasty promulgation of abortive schemes. A dozen regiments of volunteers for India Raid as well as the Q(neenfs troops, enlisted for a limited period, lovwed to select their owna officers, and promoted subsequently by merit instead of by purchaew, would soon be raised. They wouild be very popullar corps-so popular that their formation woukd at once paralyze the recruiting for the regular army, which woutld then only obtain such recruiits as had been considered unworthy to be admitted into the volunteers. In the field the privilegges poseased by the volunteers, their superior condition and education, and the consequent estimation (supposing the experiment to succeed) in which they would necessarily be held, would lower the tone of the regular army and render it dissatistied and unmanageable. No ambitious young man, conscious of merit and courage, would enter a branch of the service in which these qualities would go for little towards his advancement while another branch of it existed in which they would be sure to fetch their full value. And if from among these volunteers some half-dozen promising oficers should start prominently forward, how would it be possible to give the country the full advantage of their abilities without justly irritating the officers of the regular army, who would reasonably feel that they have paid for, and ought to posse.s, a vested interest in the higher prizes of the service ' I am convinced that a system of volunteering, such as has been proposed, is altogether. incompatible with the existence of a regular army, working parallel with it, but on totally different principles and conditions. What we ought rather to attempt is the subjection of our whole army to such new terms and rules of service, as shall bear equally and fairly on all classes willing to expose their lives in their country's cause, according to the portion of military merit which they contribute towards the general fund of the nation. Outrigging corps of volunteers, invested for the emergency with temporary advantages and privileges of a superior description, cannot fail to embarrass our leaders and degrade and disgust our regular forces as long as war lasts. Still less can they fail to be themselves disappointed when war ends, when they find themselves snubbed and laid on the shelf, as every soldier without fortune who has disting,uished himself in the field must ever find himself to be in the British army during peacetime, so long as the purchase syistem endures. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. J. 0. I izep D. L. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIM-ES. Sir,-Among the many letters which you have received from correspondents who are anxious to volunteer for service In India we have seen no notice of a class to which we ourselves belong, and which we believe to be a very large one. It is that of young men who have received the best education the country can afford at the IJniversities, and who, ion completing their studies, too often find themselves quite at a loss for any employment befitting their inclinations and the energies which a liberal education engenders. They are too old for entering upon mercantile occupations, they have not sufficient means to proceed to the bar or to the study of medicine, they have no interest at the Horse Guards, and no money to purchase a commission; and they thus find themselves, at an age when their future course ought to be definitely marked out, reduced to an aimless pursuit after anything that may " turn up." Many in this predicament enter the Church, not from inclination but necessity, and wear out their life in an occupation at once distasteful to themselves and unprofitable to others; others gain a precarious and -wearisome subsistence by private tuition or other scholastic pursuits; a third section become the relentless persecutors of members of Parliament or connexions who are supposed to have influence in procuring Government appointments; others rest all theirhopesupon theprospect of a legacy or some other contingency equallyuncertain. All these alike would gladly enter upon a course which should promise at all events the honour and respect of their feUow-countrymen, which should satisfy their aspirations after glory and adventure, which should provide them a secured subsistence, and which should enlist in its behalf aU that love of what is noble, all that hatred of cruelty and oppression, all that chivalrou devotion for the weak and helpless which1 bunis with purest flame in the breast of youth. Trusting you will allow the voice of men thus situated to be heard through your powerful columns, and enclosing our cards, We beg to remain, Sir, j T~~~~our very obedient sp,*vAn+ TWO GRADUA.TES OR ovizn*n epD. W). TO TEiE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Having been fearful of trespassing too much on your valuable space, I did not, in my letterof the 19th inst., allude to the manly and enterprising spirit which prompts so many young men of the better olasses of sodety to offer themselves for service In India. As an old soldier of the regular army, I should say that it is the firat duty oE the authorities of the Horso Guards and War-office to foster and turn to account this truly British spirit, so'strongly manilested by our courageous youth and young men whose position and habits of life naturally disincline them to enter the regular army as private soldiers. Seeing that there are but about 40 commissioned officers in a regiment of 1,000 rank and file, it Is obvious that on no possible system of promotion could any considerable number of young men of the middle olasses hope to obtain commisions by passing through the ranks of a regular regiment of the line, and in the actual stato of the British army it is wel known that, owing to the system of purchasing commissions, vacancies for ensigncies without purchaso are so few as to make it difficult to provide with commissions those cadets who pass satisfactorily through tho course of studies at the Royal Military CoUege, Sandhurst. It is thus obvious that our young men who cannot well accept the social position of a private soldier cr non.com. missioned officer in the Line must serve in corps apart, and under a different organization, from the rest of tho army. The difricult question arises-what arete be the conditions of service in the proposed volunteer corps? The Govern. ment cannot expect to obtain their services cheaper than those of the regulars; and, on tho other hand, it will be scarcely justified in procuring the help of a few volunteer battalions at a largely increased cost. Moreover, great and well-founded jealousy would be ex. cited if the volunteer soldier were paid more out of the pub. lic purse than the regular soldier. It would seem that the Government might fairly grant to the volunteers precisely the same pay and allowances, barrack, ship, and tent accommodation, as to the Line, leaving the volunteers, if they required better clothing, more com. forts, and so on, to make up the difference out of their own private resources. At the same time the volunteers must be subject to the Articles of War as fully as any other soldier, and put up with the same accommodation and regulated amount of baggage. A corps in which every man expected to have as much baggage carried for him as is allowed to an officer of regulars would be simply immovable, and wholly useless. As to the nomiuation of officers-the volunteers might be allowed to choose their own non-commissioned officers and subaltern officers, subject to the approval of their Colonels, and the captain and field officers might be chosen by the subalterns subject to the approval of the Commanderin-Chief. But, once organized, promotion should go as in .ke rest of the army. No doubt difficulties would attend such a dep,arture from rottsne as the constitution of volunteer corps for service in India. But gre.%t evils require extraordinary remedies, aud the experiment ought to be tried. The. military spirit of the middle and a large section of what a :e caled young men of the upper classes, who cannot ob.ain commissions, ought to be put to the test. It is weUl kipown that the Mexican war was brought t3 a suocestul brsue chiefly by the sarvices of the volunteers of the UWMkad States. Why should not British volunteers Avenge n treacherons and inhuua.n Sepoys the unmeniloumae horrors they have inflicted on tender and delicate Emgtish, Sootch, and Irish women I 'But, It difficulties attend the formation of volnnteer corps tor foreign service, these dificulties soaroely exist with re-- aard to home defence. The question every thinking man asks himself is, as tm sees regiment after regiment, squadron after squadLoe, battery after battery, ordered to India, what is to beeome of us at homo, in the three kingdoms, In case of any an-dden change in the politics of Europe ? Cannot the Rmperor3 of Franoe and Rusda now dictate to us ? Can we raise a finger in case either of them adopt a pohcy advera to our essentialiterests! Mest we not eat any dirt they choose to throw at us ? Do we forget that the French can man a fleet much quicker than we can ?-that the winds and waves no longer protect our coasts as before the days of steam? Some place their dependence on the Eentish hedge-rows; but who would be behind and who before the hedge? Be hind, we should have a Kentish clodhopper, with a smockfrock, heavy hobnailed boots, and possibly a pitchfork, or an old blunderbuss in his hand. Before the hedge we should have a light, well-trained disciple of the famous Mini6, in the shape of a French Chasseur, with his unerring rifle, formidable sword bayonet, with all the advantages of organization, good officers anda former experienoe in war. No doubt our small Regular and Militia foreo would do Its duty gallantly-none more so than the truly galan' P;ince at the head of the army, who has aU the courage of a Guelph and all the feelings of a Briton. But, should we be safe? Is this a state for England to be in ? Now, the question is, cannot a proper development of the volunteer system add materially to our security? Is it to be in vain that we are unquestionably a vigorous, a courageous,-nay, a pagnacious race? A fighting people as we are, must we not become mnore of a military people in the sense of better training and more general acquaintance with military affairs ? The idle dreams of the Peace Society have received a practical refutation from the late outbreak of the Sepoys. Messrs. Cobden and Bright would not now advise us to stand still, and let our wives and daughters be violated and our own throats be cut. Let us, thercfore, eneourage military exercises among onr people; let us foster instead of throwing cold water on the military spirit of the conntry, by liberally aiding, and even rewarding, so far as may be, all those who are willing to arm themselves for the defenoe of all that is dear to a free and loyalnation,-our families, our homes, our country, our Queen. Woe to the nation that neglects its military institutions. Thanking you, Sir, for your most able, most patriotic, and most influential exertions in behalf of your country, I remain, your obedient servant. ONE WHO HIAS SERVED 40 YEARS. Sep. 24.
-EBNERA L HAVEL L OK. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have waited vainly for some days In the hope that I should see some distinguished mark of Royal favour bestowed apon that great man on whose proceedings the eyes of the country are anxiously fxed as the one hope of Englnd in India, General Havelook; and all that ha, yet been done to reward his glorious career is a pension of 1001. a-year, which he shares, I suppose, in common with dfty or a hundred ordinary nen ! Is it posdble, Sir, that any cold etiquette can be allowed to stand in the way of the expression of that intense grati. tude which I venture to say the nation feels for those brave and glorious deeds? Who knows how soon a life of such toil and such peril may be cut short ? Let it not be said that any time was lost in rewarding it while it Lasted. Let the very next mail carry to General Havelock the news that his services are appreciated in England, and that no honour is gradged to the man who with a handful of brave soldiers has enoonntered over and over again incalculable odds and in every conflict has come off victorious. Little do our rulers appear to be aware of all that they lose by failing to reward, or by rewarding too lAte, the ser. vices of such a man as Havelock. Do they imagine that France would have left such an oflicer for one week ungraced by every title of honour and every form of reward which soldiers value or a grateful country can besow ? I am, Sir, your obedient servant. PHILAGATHOS. Lour correspondent should make allowance for the fact that there is scarcely a Minister in London, that Lord Panmure is more intent on the destruction of grouse than of mutineers, and that " the fountain of Honour" itself is far away in the Highlands out of reach even of telegraph.]
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-I have read with deep indignation a letter from Colonel Sykes inT heTimesof lastTuesdayin which he seeks to make out " an absolute parallelism between the mutinies of 1806 and 1857 ;" and, after referring to Mr. Wilberforce's speech and the Annual Begidter, he breaks forth Into the following lamentation:-" Alas! these terrible and prophetic words were written 51 years ago, and we shudder in reflecting that a disregard or oblivion of their importance has involved half the families of England in anguish, despair, and mourning." Now, I do most emphatically protest against this solemn triSing. It is a shameful thing to attempt thus to throw dust into eyes that are dim with tears. Every one who knows anything of India knows well that the cartridge question was not the cause, but only the excuse, for the outbreak; that our native troops were ripe for revolt long before they ever handled the new rifles, and only waited for a seasonable opportunity, when any other pretext would have served their turn equally wel. The present insurrection is not parallel with that at Vellore. Whether the presence of pigs' fat is real or imaginary, it was at least not with the sanction of the Go. vernment that it found its way into the composition of the cartridge, nor was any intentional violence done to the religious prejudices of the Sepoys by their commanding officers; whereas, "in the case of the mutiny at VeUore, coercive measures of the most aggravating description had been re. sorted to," and the most wanton outrage bad been committed upon the feelings of our native soldiers by insisting upon removing from their foreheads "the tilluck," which is the distinctive sign of their faith. Instead of referring to the bygone prophecies of anclent seers and tho register of events that are now only a memory and a tale, Colonel Sykes had better refer to the book of the prophecies of Sir Charles Napier, which to the English public is quite a new revelation, though known to him nearly 10 years. Instead of sheltering himself behind "' the dim and dark imagininge' of 51 years ago, which have no possible connexion with our present disasters, let him come forward frankly, on the part of himself and his brother Directors, and tell the English people what they havea right to know when the blood of their best loved ones has been poured out like water; let him tell us why the honest remonstrances and repeated warnings of Sir Charles Napier and others havo been so long smothered; why Delhij Cawnpore, and Agra have been left dotenceless till our brothers and sisters and their helpless babes were slaughtered in their streets, while the magnates of Icadenhall.streot wero slandering the conqueror of Scindo, or sordidly litigating for the legacies of Dyce Sombre. The generous heart of England, even when wrung with the most bitter sorrow, can pity and forgive the miserable ignorance and obstinacy of its Indian rulers while the waves of a common calamity are roling over thoir heads and ours; but let them at least learn to reverenco in dooent silence a nation's grief, and not parade themselves before our eyes in the tattered garments of hypocrisy, which are all too poor to hide " the shame of their nakednes" When the Directors of the India-house can have recourse to such impotent shuffling as Colonel Sykes can descend to it is quite time to remind them that for all the blood which has been spUt-and God knows what yet remains-a more terrible account may yet be required at their hands than they wiiU be very wiUing to render to the urgent and united demands of " half the families of England." Your obedient servant. J. M.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,- In your very able leading article of Monday last there is one omission, umintentional, I am sure, on your part, which has occasioned much pain to the relatives of those concerned. In speaking of General Havelock's "band of heroes," a you justly term them, you say-" If Havelock could do so much with tho 64th and the 78th, what may not be done with the half-dozen fresh regiments thus coming in ?9' Now, in addition to the two gaUant regiments spocified, there is another-the Madras Fusileers, who are thus spoken of by General Havelock in his last despatch:-" The 1la Madras Fusileers again distinguished themselves." Ia private letters it is stated that Lieutenant Dangerfield, oE tlids regiment, was the first man in the rebel intrenchments. Ood forbid that I should undervalue the noble services of Hek I3ijesty's troops in this arduous struggle, while, as a Compau,'s officer, I cannot but feel proud that my owa service s ,eo honourably distinguishing itgelf. I venture io solicit the insertion of these few lines in your valuable jOnrnal, and remain your obedient servant, AN OLD OFFICQR,
