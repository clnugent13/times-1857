MOAN. -MARKT and ITYINTBLLIGBNyB. I Thursday Evening. The Bank of England have to-day raised their charge for discount from 8 per cent., which was adopted on the 19th ult., to the unprecedented rata of 9 per cent. The public were fuly prepared for the measure, and in some quarters it had been anticipated even that the movement would have been to 9 per cent. for bils not having more than 60 days to run, and 10 per cent, for longer descriptions. That the latter restriction would not have proved too strong seems aIready to have been indicated by the fact that the demand has shown little, if any, diminution. As the public have now an amount of notes tn their hands equal to any recent average, and business has been for some time undergoing rapid contraction, this continued pressure must be mainly caused by alarm and the consequent desire of every person to be over supplied. The question whether any further rise will be necessary will therefore greatly depend upon the extent to which this action is carried. If the mercantile community, instead of recognizing from what they have already wit- iessed of the course of the Bank that they are in no danger of being suddenly shut out from accomamodation, will pertinaciously rush to obtain a double share, any inconvenience they may sustain will be of their own creating. The Bank can undertake to provide for wants, but not for fears. There is not the slightest provocative to panic, and whether such a humiliating exhibition of national ignorance and folly can now take place is a question rational people would hardly have entertained a few weeks back. The old opponents of the Bank Charter Act, however, are beginning to bustle in the storm, and it is impossible to feel certain on any point. One of their great modes of creating fright is by pointing to the low state of the reserve of unemployed notes, as if when that is exhausted the Bank would be obliged to cease discounting altogether. But the fact is that the Bank could, under such circumstances, Etill continue their discounts on as great a scale as ever, since their bills receivable each day of course on the average bring in as large a total as they are ordinarily asked to let out. They could not increase the scale, but no one will suppose that with a contraction of business In all quarters any increase can be required. There ja consequently not the shadow of a pretext for any cry for Government palliatives. Some persons who have shown every disposition to assist in allaying idle apprehensions have nevertheless suggested that Government should intimate their readiness to grant a conditioual power of relaxation in the same manner as in 1847,-that is, by a notification that upon payment of a certain rate sufficiently high to prevent needless applications the public should be allowed to have any extent of discount they might require, without regard to the increase or decrease of the stock of bullion. But the public have never in the present crisis been without an assurance equally strong. It is admitted that it does not matter how high the rate may be, so long as the certainty is given that money can be had at some rate. When has this certainty been called, in question 7 The very object o' the Bank in each successive advance is to maintain a position to enable them to oomply with every legitimate application, and there can be no doubt of this being effected, unless an insane demand upon them should prevent it. It may, however, be asked, " Why not avert the chance of such folly by a Government notice that would calm everybody? Grant that in principle it would be humiliating and ridiculous, still it could do no harm, and might prevent much mnischief." This announcement can scarcely be requisite. All classes of the public must be well aware that if thIe nation should so pitiably lose its self-possession as to give way to panic there is but one:remedy, and that the Government will be compelled to adopt it. There can be no need, however, by a formal proceeding to proclaim a belief that the financial sense of the nation is still so low as to cause the degrading contingency to be regarded not only as possible, but probable. The fands to day have exhibited fully as much steadiness as could have been anticipated. Under the certainty that a further movement would take place at the Bank they opened at a decline of a quarter per cent., and subsequently experienced another slight fall, but the market was without agitation. Consols for money were first quoted S80 to J, from which they advanced to 89. They then remained at 88. to 89 till the brealing up of the Bank Court, when several sales of stock, some of which were alleged to be on account of the Bank, caused a reaction to 88i to i, which was the final quotation. For the 7th of December the last transactions were at 89 to J. Advances on stock were in demand in the afternoon at uncertain rates, ranginig between 7 and 7t per cent. Bank Stock left off at 2U9 to 211 ; Reduced, 87J to i ; New Three per Cents., 87a to - ; India Stock;, 210 to 212; India Bonds, 45s. to 35s. discount; and Exchequerbills, 1.5s. to 10s. discount. In connexion with the Bank announcement today no one can fail to ece cause of congratulation at the fact of a heavy loan to IDdia having thus far been avoided. Even the assistance already affbrded to that country-amounting to three or four millions sterling, since the cessation of the payments ord_ narily due from it must equally with the specie in course of despatch be regarded as a contribution on our part-has seriously aggra-vatcd the difficulties of the crisis, and if a loan of five or ten millions in addition had been contracted we should undoubtedly for the sake of making everything smooth to the Indian people and the routine financiers at Calcutta have plunged the entire trade of the empire into confusion. Happily, too, as regards the future, it may be hoped that the advance to 9 per cent. will have the good effect of causing the 13 ome Government to insist that these financiers, before availing themselves of .he easy method of drawing upon what they fancy -to be the exhaustless resources of England, shall be compelled to attempt the discovery whether a country which for a long time has been absorbing silver from us at the rate of six millions per annum cannot be made to provide In some degree for the cost of its own disturbances. Periods of inurrection are precisely those in which a suspension of specie payments is not only legitimate, but in most cases, as a matter of justice, indispensable; and even Hf it were an unmixed evil, instead of a salutary precaution, it would be better that the natives of India should be subjected to the slight inconvenience of receiving their dividends and other claims in interest-bearing but temporarily inconvertible paper than that the commerce of Europe and America should be convulsedand thousands of families bethrown out of employment, in order that there should be no discom- fort on that side aud no interruption to the facilities of hoarding. It is the business of the Indiaa (Government to consider what they would do if they had not the English exchequer to fall upon. Would they abandon the country, or would the wholesome stimulus of necessity yield its usual results? We have supplied men and munitions, and India is rich enough to find money. There is no reason to assume that the issue of a note circulation, even on a large soale-supposing it requisite as a last resource-a clrcumstance far from cer3;in-would be attended with difficulty. The natives would be found sufficiently keen to esti=ate the vlueo cd a GoTernment note, carryIng 6 or 7 per cent. interest, and receivable at par in the courseo of six or twelve months for reTenue dues, and at the same time we should have the the satijfactioa of knowing that every one with paper of this description in his pocket would feel an access of loyalty and a proportionate desire for the maintenance of order. An average business has been transacted in the foreign stocks generally, at the depressed prices or yesterday. A further fall of # per cent. occurred in Turkish. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99i ; for the account, 99 ; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Danish Three per Cents., 83 and 84k; Peruvian Four-and-a.Ealf per Cents., for the account, 75i and 76i; Portuguese, 42k; Spanish lieew Deferred, 25- for both money and the account; ditto, Certificates, 5; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 86k, 871, and 861 ; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 97* and ~; for the account, 97i; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents, 64; ditto, Four per Cent. Certificates, 97X: and for the, account, 97. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening wero 66f. 80c. for money and 67 f. for the end of the month, ahowing a decline of only an eighth. The alteration in the Bank of England rate of discount was probably not generally known before the close of business. The private letters state that the bullion in the Bank of France has not experienced during the past week any important alteration. From all places in the continent various sums in specie seem to be in course of transmission to America. There were no gold withdrawals from the Bank to- day, some which were intended having been cbecked by the alteration in the rate of discount. The discount houses have increased their rate of allowance to 8 per cent. for money at call, and 8k for deposits with short notice, being an advance of 1 per cent. The National Discount Company have notified that their terms are, respectively, 8k and 8i per cent. The rate of the joint-stock banks for deposits will be 8 per cent. It was not expected that so large an increase would have been adopted, and in several quarters there was a strong indisposition to accede to it. The private telegraphic intelligence recelved today from New York by the Vanderbilt describes no material change during the two days which had elapsed since the previous advices. Some stocks were rather lower, but in exceptional cases there had been an advance. The failure had been announced of Messrs. Robb, Hallett, and Co., of New York, and the bank of James Robb and Co. at New Orleans, and, as it was known that 300,0001. of their bills on the Liverpool firm of R. Wilson, Hallett, and Co., which stopped on Monday last, would come back, the disaster had added considerably to the existing gloom. It is stated that the Atlantic was not to leave until the 26th of October. She will therefore bring two days' later news, and may possibly arrive to-morrow. The suspension was announced this morning of the old and important house of Naylor, Vickers, and Co., steel-manufacturers and iron-merchants at Sheffield. The amount of their liabilities has not been stated on authority, but they are rumoured to range between 600,0001. and 700,0001. The firm is of the most respectable character, and its difficulties are understood to have arisen solely frorm a total cessation of remittances from debtors in America, whose position a few months back seemed worthy of all confidence. It is confidently believed that the stoppage will prove but temporary, and it may be hoped arrangements will be forthwith made to prevent the regular business of the establishment from being impaired or materiaUy interrupted. They have branch houses at Liverpool, Stockholm, New York, and Boston. At the commnencement of the present year they possessed a clear surplus of 200,0001., besides large private property; and, as their positive losses thus far in America have been extremely small-delay in remittances being as yet the only ascertained evil-the prospects of the creditors are very favourable. Annexed is the circular issued:- "Sheffield and LIverpool, Nov. 4. "Wlth the deepest regret we have to inform you that the uttor disorganization of commercial and financial affairs In America and the impossibility of seeing the end of the present crisls make a temporary susDension of pavment imperativeuponus. We have instruated Messrs. Harmood, Banner, and Son, of Liverpool, to prepare a statement of our affair which will prove our assets to consist In so great a proportion of metals and real property, and our surplus to be so large, that the eventual payment i full of your olaim Is beyond question, and that all we requ is time. This statement will he ready to he laid before a meeting of our creditors on Tuesday, the 24th inst., at 2 o'clock, at oulr offices in Shefield, at w hich we urgently request your attendance. " We remain, &o., "NAYLOR, VICEERS, Ax]) Co." T'he Liverpool letters state the suspension of Messrs. W. Orr and Co., in the River Plate trade. The liabilities are not supposed to be very heavy. At a meeting of the creditors of Carr, Brothers, and Co., of Newcastle, who failed on the 6th of August, the inspectors, through Mr. Coleman, reported the result of the further investigation into the affairs of the establishment, and as to the compositions offered by parties to the bills on which the firm were liable. It appeared that there was a small increase in the amount of the liabilities, but that the statements as to the working of the collieries during the first seven months of this year were more favourable than had been anticipated. A question was raised and considerably discussed as to the admissibility of certain bills negotiated for or in conjunction with Messrs. Carr and CO.'s business, and it was ultimately agreed that such biUs should be admitted to rank on the estate, and the inspectors were authorized to have the necessary deeds prepared for carrying out the arrangement. The liquidators of the Hull lax and Cotton Mils Company, which failed in September, have made a call of 251. per share on the shares, in addition to the 1001. which has already been paid in full. On the 501. shares only 401. had been paid, and the holders of these are required to pay 121. 10s., and an additional 51. On the 251. shares only half has been paid, and the call on them is 121. 10s. and an additional 21. 10s. The authorized capital of the company was 375,0001., the proportion paid up at the time of the stoppage being 244,5671. 10s. The number of shareholders Is 140, and the further claim upon them, in addition to the loss of all their capital, must involve much misery. A special meeting of the General MIining Association was held this afternoon, Mr. A. C. Bridge in the cnair, to sanction the proposed increase of capital required for the purchase of the interest of the late Duke of York in the mines and minerals of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. The sum to be raised is 50,0001., and it Is proposed to issue pro ratd among the proprietors 5,000 now shares of 201. at 101. each. The report stated that by the new lease the company obtain, among other advantages, the abolition of the fixod rent and the reduction of the royalty from 2s. to 6d. or 4d. No export duty on coals will be imposed by the colonial Legislature without leave of the society. In return they engage to relinquish their right to other minerals, giving up a merely nominal privilege. After a short discussion, In the course of which it was observed that the alterations were worth 10,0001. a-year to the shareholders, the proposed arrangements were approved unanimously.

AMERICAL - ------s SOUTHAMPTON, Nov. 5. The United States steamship Vanderbilt, Captain Edward Higgins, arrived at Cowes this morning from New York, whiek-sl'e1ft on the evening of the 24th ult. Her delpaiq6urb, was delayed for six hours, expecting to bring'the mails of the Collins's steamer Atlantic, which haid met with some trifling accident, but she did not bring them. The Atlantic Was to leave for Liverpool on the 26th. The Vanderbilt brings 183 passengers for Southampton and Havre, but has no specie. Her arrival off Hurst was telegraphed at 9 a.m., but the smaU steamer, with her passengers, &c. for this port, did not arrive here till after 2 p.m. The delay was caused by the Vanderbilt touching the ground at the Brambles as she was making Cowes, there being a very dense fog at the time; but she fortunately got off again easily without sustaining any further damage than three hours' detention, and has proceeded on to Havre. She has had very rough weather during the voyage across the Atlantic. The Jason, screw steamer, from Southampton, arrived at New York on'the 23d, having experienced during the passage a series of heavy gales from the westward, with a sea running the equal of which had not been seen by the oldest seaman on board. Despatches had reached Washington from Colonel Alexander, commanding the advance of the Utah military expedition-the first received since the detachment left Fort Leavenworth. Colonel Alexander and his command, consisting of eight companies of the I0th Infantry, had marched a distance of 620 miles within the time allotted by the orders issued by General Harney. The soldiers had enjoyed excellent health, and the loss of animals had been but trifling. The United States' surveying-ship Arotic, Commander Berryman, arrived at New York on the 22d. She had been absent over three months, making surveys along the coast of Newfoundland connected with the Atlantic Telegraph scheme, and deep sea soundings and thermometrical observations in the Gulf Stream. In reference to the Ohio State election a despatch from Cleveland of the 22d says:- "The official returns from 72 counties have been roceived. Chase's majority, official and reported, is 2,027. The indications are that the Senate will stand 15 Repub. licans to 18 Democrats; and the House, Republicans 46, Democrats 57." The New Yorlk ReDublican State Central Committee had issued an a'ddress to their friends urging them to instantly organize in support of the principles and candidates of the Republican party. From WashiDgton a despatch informs us that the President, hearing that ex-President Pierce contemplated visiting Madeira for the benefit of his wife's health, had, through the Secretary of the Navy, tendered him a passage in the steamer Powhattan, which was on the eve of leaving for the East Indies, touching at Madeira. The Liverpool packet-ship Jacob A. Westervelt took fire in New York Harbour: on the 23d In her cabin, and before the flames could be subdued she was damaged to the amount of about $2,000. A meeting of the directors and shareholders of the New York and Erie Railroad was held on the 22d in the lecture-room of the Mercantile Library, for the purpose of raising subscriptions to relieve the road from its present financial embarrassments. About $400,000 were subscribed, and a committee appointed to collect subscriptions. A convention of delegates from New York country banks was held at Syracuse on the 22d. Ow'ing to the insufficiency of the notice given-the circulars calling the meeting having been destroyed by the burning of the mail bags on the Central Railroad a few days ago-there was but athin attendance, only 36 delegates being present, representing acapital of some $6,000,000. Resolutions wrere adopted recommending the country banks to discount to the extent of their ability, and to aid in bringing produce to the seaboard; also appointing a special committee to effect an association for the mutual protection and interest of the banks, and to arrange a system of redemption and e.xchange. The delegates expressed themselves very freely with regard to the city banks. The meeting stood adjourned, subject to the call of the special committee. Several large and extensively known houses in New York had signified their willingness to receive consignments of flour and grain from the West, among whom, befides Messrs. Spofford and Tileston, we may mention Messrs. Grinnell, Minturn, and Co., and others had been mentioned as willing to do the same thing, and to pay freight and charges to New York, with the view of aiding in the movement of bread3tuffs from the interior to the seaboard, by which the present pressure might be alleviated and exchanges equalized. Commercial affairs continued in a very unsettled and unsatisfactory state. The NVew York herald of the 24th, in its review of the previous day's moneymarket, says:- " This (the 23d) has been a very blue day in Wall-street. So far as the stock-market is concerned we see nothing in the immediate future but depreciation and disappointment. As for speculation, it is out of the question. The bnUs have a very gloomy aspect, and outside holders of stocks who want money must make up their minds to take lower prices. At the first board to-day Virginia Sixes declined 2 per cent.; Bank of America, 1; Camberland Coal, i; Pacifio Steamship Company, 2; New York Central Railroad, 11; Galena and Chicago, 2i; Reading, 1; Michigan Southern, old, 1.i; ditto preferred, 1; Panama, 13; Illinois Central Railro%d, 1; Cleveland and Pittsburg, 2; Cleveland and Toledo, 1; Chicago and Rock Island, 11. Illinois Central bonds ad. vanced 1.4 per cent. There is no life in the market. " At the second board the decline in prices was to some extent upon a very limited amount of business. Nearly all the transactions were for cash. Virginia State Sixes fell off 6 per cent.; Erie bonds, 1871, 2; Pennsylvania Coal, 4; New York Central Railroad, 3; Hudson Railroad, 1; Michigan Southern preferred, 1; Erie Railroad, ; Reeding, 2; Panama, 2; Chicago and Rock Island, 41; La Crosse and Mllwaukie, J. Stocks are rapidly running back to the old level. "The apprehensions in financial circles regarding the course of the money-market and money matters generaly are as great now as at any time during the present revulsion, and tho panic is as wide-spread and as intense as at any previous period. The next steamer from Earopo is looked for with the greatest anxiety. She will not bring the worst by a great deal. Up to the date of her departure they had received in England nothing worse than the suspension of the Philadelphia and Baltimore banks Eand a few heavy faUures among the commercial classes. When the news of the suspension of the banks of the city of New York arrlves in London there will, beyond all doubt, be a panio equal to anything realized on this side. The suspension of the Bank of England and the Bank of France are events we shall not be surprised to see reported by any steamer after that. We de not see how they ean continue specie payments in the face of an active demand for gold forshipment to the United States. We understand that a large amount of sterling bils of exchange were returned by the Earopa. Bills drawn by the Penn. sylvania Bank in London were returned protested for non-acceptance. They are supposed to have been mere kites for speculative purposes. Bills drawn by Robb, Hallett, and Co., in London, were also returned non-accepted. The return of these bills must create a great deal of diffculty among houses here who remitted them to meet maturing liabilities abroad. The acceptances In London in anticipation of remittances from this side to meet the bills have, of course, been made to an immense amount; and as no remittances have been made since the revulsion here commenced, the position of houses in London must be rendered very precarious. "'The assistant treasurer reports to-day as follows:- Total receipts ..1 ... . 0 .. 102,597 94 Total payments .. ... .. 140,997 06 Total balance . .. ... ... 5,910,106 52 Of the receipts to-day $41,000 was on account of duties. "The total number of failures officially reported since the 1st of August is about 900. It is estimated that the total liabilities of these suspensions will amount to full $90,000,000. It will be seen by this that there is plenty of food for a general bankrupt law. During the whole of the revulsion in 1837 the number of failures reported in this city was about 500; but the returns under the bankrupt law, in I841, showed that 5,000 took the benefit of that Act, showing liabilities amounting to about $50,C00,000O "1 The announcement of the suspension of Robb, Hallett, and Co. this morning created eome surprise. This is a branch of a house of the same name in New Orleans, The bank of James Robb, of Now Orleans, is a atock company, and therefore a separate ooncern. The house of Tallent and Wilde, of San Francisoo, was founded some years since by Mr. Robb, but it Is, we beHleTe, inno way oenaeotod with the houses here, except in their exchazge operatioasj which will, we understand, be properly protected4 Mesrs, Robb, Hallott, and Co. have a branch house in London, and they have done a very large foreign exchange business. A good many of their bills, it is reported, came back by the Europa. *'The Lebanon VaUley Railroad Company has been obliged I o suspend its work near Harrisburg, and 550 labourers are diecharged from its unfinished sections. "' The work upon the w4bole line of the Auburn and Allen town Railroad was stopped last Wednesday, owing to the , uspension of Messrs. Choteau, Sandford, and Co. Al the workmen have been discharged. 'The steamship Persia, from Liverpool, is about due at this port, with seved days' later intelligence from Europe. Her arrival is anxiously;1ooked for. We have no doubt the advices she wiUl bring will be of the most unfavourablo cbaracter. The full force of our financial- revulsion will be known in London before her departure and the effec' will have shown itself in the money-ma,ket. The diffi culties and embarrassments of the Bank of England have' doubtless, been severely augmented by the disastrous inteUi. gence taken out from this country, and we may look fo - most gloomy accounts. The bankruptoy of our large rail-. road companies must be unfavourable intelligence to a large body of European capitalists, and to those houses directly connected with the finances of these companies the news will be of the most startling importance. The AngloAmerican banking houses of London will be the most serious sufferers by the collapse in our railroad credits. Several of them must be very deeply involved, and theic capitals, however large they may be, may not suffice to fill the vacuum oaused by depreoiation and actual losses. It is wel known that some of our largest railway loans have been negotiated in London by the Anglo-American banking houses, and it Is also well known that they are direct holders of large amounts of our most worthless railroad securities and bonds, which are not to-day worth 10 cents on the doUar, and ranked as the lowest class before this revulsion commenced. Those houses will be sorely tried by thls panic and prostration. The class of houses in London and liverpool that Wi feel seriously the state of our markets are those directly and indirectly connected with our foreign import trade. Those concerns are pretty well distributed and pretty well backed up with capital They are located in all the principal cities of Great Britain, and are able to stand a pretty good bleeding. We do not fear much for this class of merchants, for the aggregate amount due from this side in the way of trade is not large. It must be borne in mind that our actual indebtedness on our last year's foreign trade wae not at the close verY heavy. Payments up to the last moment before the revulsion commenced were liberaly made, and we havo only to point to our immense exportation of specie during the year ending June 30, 1857, for a confirmation of this statement. The balance due at the close of the old year, and the obligations incurred on the new, are so well distributed among the manufacturers of Europe that we do not look for any disastrous oonsequences to that clam. In 1837 the foreign import trade of the country was carried on through credits with three great banking houses in London and the revulsion brought them down without ruining any of the manufacturers of Birmingham or Manchester. This debt ix now better distributed, and withal cannot be very large. The railroad interest is a very dlfferent affair. The ful indebtednees of the different railroad companies is represented on paper, and th'at paper floats about from hand to hand as so much currency, or settles down in the hands of capitaliste and others as so much productive property. So long as its credit and negotiability is maintained, its value Is real, and represents actual wealth. It will pay debts from one man to another, and serves materially il adjusting balances in money matters. The moment this enormou; interest became discredited, that moment hundreds of millions of property became nominaly valueless, and all these widely extended banking houses and business houses generally dealing in and based upon this clams of securities found themselves at once without support. We have seen the effect of the collapse in this property on this side of tha Atlantic. It will not be many weeks before the fuU effeo' of such an utter annihilation of value wiiU be seen upon the eame class of banking houses in London." The Courier and Enhquirer of the same date says:- " One of the fist effects of the inteligence in London of the revulsion in this market has been the prompt curtil. ment of American credit. This is felt in the refusal to accept for the honour of drawers on this side any bils except for funds actually in hand. We learn that a small amount of the bils drawn by the Bank of Pennsylvania on their London correspondent, hMr. George Peabody, have been protested for non-acceptanoe. The suspension of MessrsRobb, Haliett, and Co., bankers in this city, was aunounced this morning, attributed to the return of their sterling bills by the Europa's maiL The firm of James Robb and Co., bankers, New Orleans, is likewise connected with the NTew York house, and it is thought will suffer severely in con sequence. The bank of James Robb, at New Orleans, one of the new free banks of that city, of which Mr.James Robb Is president, will not be affected by the present suspension. This bank was paying specie at the last date. "Other bils than those alluded to have been returned under protest by the Europa's mail, showing a determi. nation on the part of English bankers and merchants to restrict their American credits at present to a very narrow line. " The negotiation of foreign bills for some weeks past has been very difficult, in consequence of the want of money. Remitters could not pay in cash for bills even at the extraordinary quotations of leading drawers-viz., 102 to 105 for sterling bills at 60 days, and 445 to 560 for francs. Now another cause of disturbance arises,-even if money were more plentiful, there is doubt as to the willingness of parties in London, Paris, Liverpool, Hamburg, &c., to accept American bills. " All the existing circumstances will serve to depress the Liverpool market for cotton, and to interrupt for a longer period the current of foreign exchange. Eor breadstuffs shipped hence there will be required an export of bulion from England, a deviation from the coursa of trade much to be regretted, as it will create further trouble in the money. markets of Paris and London, and soon react upon us again. The course pursued by the London brokers in 1837, under somewhat similar circumstances, was to refuse accommoda. dation to parties connected with trade of the United States. Numerous failures occurred in consequence, and, as a measure of self-defence, they may see fit to adopt a simldar course under present exigencies. " We regret to learn that the house of Messrs. Lord, Warren, Evans, and Co. have suspended, and ask a six months' extension from maturlty on all their indebtedness. These gentlemen have always maintained a high standing as upright, enterprising, and intelligent men of business, and will meet with general sympathy in their present misfortune. " The Treasury Department having exhausted the funds appropriated to the purchase of Government secuities, the atter have fallen in price for want of purchasers. The price week ago for United States' Six per Cents of 1867-8 was 1174, now they can be had at 114. Ohio and Kentucky Sixes have advanced 1 to 3 per cent. California Sevens are quoted at 2 per cent. better." The New York Morning Express says " The movement of the banks continues to be towards a greater contraction, varied in some few instances. The next woekly statement will show an increase of coin with a marked decrease of loans and deposits. This is the only report to be looked for. The banks in suspension, of course, seek to strongthen themselves by renewing their coin and reducing their ciroulation. To do this a reduction follows in their discounts, for It is only by the conversion of the debts due the banks into gold that they oan get it, and it Is only by decreasing discounts that their circulation can ba retired. The hope that suspension would stimulate the banks to expand must be abandoned. "Much complaint is made of the delay of southern and western agents in remitting collections on New York s.ccount. All parties out of town who are desirous of taking New York business should at once address our banks by circular, stating what they will collect, at what rates, wbether they are in condition to make prompt remittances, and in what mode they intend to make them. " Collections were never in a woree state, and the information suggested is very much wanted." The Bxpress of the 24th, under the head of 1' Effects of the Pressure," publishes the subjoiaed melancholy catalogue:- "' N Nothing to do' is the cry that is coming up to uS from all the great cities, north, east, and west. An army of mechanics and labourers are already out of employment, and from all appearances there will be additions to rather than subtractions from it before Christmas.

THE 60TH RIBLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-In TheC Times of yesterday appeared a letter giving the names of the offloers and men belonging to Her Majesty's 60th Rifles who have fallen before Delhi I happen to know a good deal about this regiment, and I fancy there are but few in this country who have the slightest Idea of what it has gone through, and of ths extraordinary number of officers and men who have fallen. The (30th Rifles were the first to arrive before Delhi on the breaking out of the mutiny. They left Meerut under their commanding officer, Lientenant-Colonel Jones, 450 strong, and on the 23d of August this number had been reduced by the bullets of the enemy to 220. In 61 days they were closely engaged with the enemy 25 times, and, whatever acts of heroism we may have heard or road of, few have ever exceeded that mentione( by your correspondent;" J. M'Pherson, he fought wlth nine bals in him, the tenth k iled him ;" and many others I see have been wounded twice. Of officers 19 have been kiUed and wonnded,-nearly the number that left Mmeert. The Crimean war had the advantago of a gentleman sent by you, Sir, who could chronicle the deeds of valour per formed by our soldiors; unfortunately our Indian army does not possess this advantage. I think, therofore, It is the duty of every ono who may possess any information concerning that heroio band who have so nobly upheld the honour Of their oountry to place such information before the British publio. It is well to recall to mind the ooncluding paragraph of Sir W. Napler'g Hiutory of ae Pcninsidar War. I trust our soldls, both men and offioers, may have no caus to oomplain I remain, Sir, your faithfel servant, LUTTERWOP,TH. Nov. 4.
ZONDON, FBUDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1857, Lord GRANVIM'S defence of the GovernorGeneral of India, at the MIansion-house on Wednesday, was necessarily so fuU of reserves and qualifications that it furnishes the public with little more knowledge on the subject than they possessed before. That Lord CANNING'S position became unexpectedly arduous, that he was suddenly confronted with perils of unexampled magnitude, that the ordinary duties of his office were abruptly exchanged for responsibilities of the most awful character, and that under such circumstances he has fair claims upon the conaideration of hiis countrymen-aU these are -oints commanding general acknowledgment and assent. It is undoubtedly true also, as Lord GnANviTLE remarks, that the opinions which we involuntarily form upon the receipt of intelligence from India might undergo material modifications if we were in possession of a more complete and comprehensive knowledge of facts. This argument, however, which is almost invaria3;ly employed in deprecation of popular censure, would, if rigidly applied, prevent the formation of any opinion at all. Complete knowledge never comes. Though the contests and recriminations Dccasioned by the Crimean campaigns are now coniigned to oblivion, it cannot be said that we have ever yet arrived at what all parties would call truth; andif we were to reserve our judgment in the present case for the time when the history of the Bengal mutinies should have been unexceptionably elucidated, the whole existing generation might descend io its grave with the subject still unexamined. It is of no use entering upon any defence of the practice actuaUy prevailing in this respect, for the simple reason that it is unavoidable. Men must talk and cliticize, especially when the events are zo momentous and the interests excited so deep. They cannot and will not wait for an inquiry which may or may not occur a year or two hence, and which may or may not result in any positive deciy,ion. They must express their views at once, though they hold themselves open to information and correction; and, as a matter of fact, we must needs say that time and investigation often do little more than confirm the instinctive impressions of the public. We very much doubt irhether the conduct of the Indian Government will appear this day twelvemontha in a light substantially differing from that in which it sta-ads at present. Of course, there are many particulars of which we are ignorant, especially those concerning deliberations of State, but events have now been spread over so many months, the policy of Government has been indicated by so many acts, and al these transactions have been reported and illustrated by such an infinity of authentic and independent communications, that we suspect the substance of the case is pretty well before us. Judged by these impressions, the conduct of Lord CAN.r-G would receive, upon the whole, no unfavourable verdict. It is impossible, indeed, to quibble or wrangle over the one weighty fact which Lord Gnxwvi;. adduced-the fact of success, for success it must be called, notwithstanding all the calamities intervening, when a Governor-General of India, unaided by the arrival of a single battalion from England, has first withstood and then crushed in its stronghold a revolt of 100,000 native soldiers. If at the outbreak of the mutiny we had been told in this country that it would embrace the whole Bengal army, and that the army of Bombay would show manifest signs of sympathy before the first column of reinforcements could reach India from these shores, it cannot be denied that the capture oI Delhi and the general discomfiture of the insuruents would have been regarded as contingencies calling for great satisfaction. If we proceed further, too, in the scrutiny of these transactions, we find ample matter for approbationi in the unremnitting energy by which succours were collected at Calcutta, and despatched to the Upper Provinces. There was not a station or settlement within reach of the Governor-General from which he did not draw every available bayonet, and, as far as yet appears, with all practicable aespatch. This, in fact, at the moment was the zhief duty of Government. The one great object was to get troops together, to liberate our besieged ,arrisons, and to reinforce the army before Delhi. We failed, unhappily, to reach Cawnpore in time Eor the rescue, but Lucknow we devoutly trust !ias been relieved, and Delhi has been actually cardied by storm. It was when these first convulsive struggles for elf-preservation were exchanged for the more Drdinary proceedings of Government that the chief occasion for dissatisfaction with Lord CANIsG'S policy appears to have arisen. For this dissatisfaction we still think, notwitbstanding Lord GRAN-VLLS'S deprecation, that there was sufficient cause. It is not merely in a particular proclamation or a particular appointment that objectionable features are discernible, but in the concurrence and tenour of a succession of acts. What scandalized and exasperated the people of this country was the apparent impress of a narrow, traditionary, and exploded policy upon the actual proceedings of Government at this terrible crisis. The worst spirit of the old Indian Civil Service became suddenly visible in the acts of the Administration, to the prejudice and disparagement of our struggling troops, almost before the death-grapple could be said to have been decided. It was not that the proclamation which Lord GRANVILL.s analyzed was theoretieally unjust, but that it was out of place altogether, and betrayed unwelcome principles in its terms and its tone. The policy of the Government at this period seemed to indicate the general ascendancy of a spirit opposed to the dictates of justice, and based only on the interests of a class. The magnitude of the revolution, which had at first been denied, was depreciated; the dreadful incidents of the revolt were alluded to in commonplace terms, and great anxiety was shown so to represent and arrange matters that the action of our nilitary coramanders should giveplace as soon as possible not merely to civil government, but to the routine of an administration as little as possible undisturbed. Perhaps the distinctions drawn in the Government proclamation may be logically justifiable, but people in this county would rather have seen the matter left to ouur Generals in the field. W'e could have wished that instead of appointments of civiliansand promotionsof Mahomedans-instead of elaborate edicts respecting the apportionment of penalties, the prominent features of Lord CAN-iNG's policy had been a bold recognition of the real state of affairs, and a decisive support of those men on whom the control of India now actually rests. We wish Colonel NEL had been a more conspicuous figure than such an Indo-maniac as Mr. GRANT, and that the fine shades and delicate discrimiinations of mutiny and murder had been left to the cognizance of our officers on the spot. The policy of old Indian administrators is perfectly natural. They wish to make something less than a revolution out of the matter, and to preserve their own privileges and functions as far unimpaired as may be. But the system is now past and gone. India can never again be the India of former times, though we hope it may be something far better. We have never been among the detractors of Indian statesmen. For the general government of that country there is much to be said,-more, by far, than many people appear to conceive. To the status quo, however, we can never now return. We cannot have a dominant Sepoy army, a system of centralization affecting even the autholity of regimental officers themselve, or a government in which power auid responsibility are so divided that no effective share is to be found in any one pair of hands. In so far as the old policy of Indian administration rests upon these traditions it mnust perish, and any attempt to revive or preserve it made at the expense of that military power to which we now look for the pacification of our Eastern Empire will infallibly evoke the discontenat and remonstrances of the public.
There is nothing in the Central American question which is very interesting to the English people. For many years the Spanish States which are situated near the Isthmus have shared that indifforence with which we are accustomed to regard the politics of the mother country. Their Social relations, their customs, their friendships, and their feuds have been less studied on this side of the Atlantic than the doings in Caffraria or Borneo. But of late an adventitious notoriety has attached to these regions. They have been the scene of adventures which recall, however unworthily, the remembrance of the bucaniers three centuries ago. The United States, with an increasing population and great inaterial prosperity, of course contain a number of restless spirits, who, having neither the will to work nor the capital to speculate, are glad of any enterprise -which promises them excitement and congenial employment. Hence the series of attacks which have been directed against the possessions of the Spanish race during the last 10 years. In the greatest of these the whole nation took part, and the result was the annexation of the fairest portions of the Mexiean State to the territory of the Union. The acquisition of Texas, California, and New Mexico and the brilliant campaigns of ScoTr and TAYLon have naturally made the despoiling of Spanish America a popular idea. Invasion has become to some extent a pastime for the idle and dissisipated. 'Witbin a few years Cuba haa been attacked, and Nicaragua occupied for months by forces waging a kind of private war under the name of Filibustering. The profound peace which reigns on the American continent, the smallness of the United States' army, and the consequent waut of an outlet for the military spirit of the population, have no donbt led to those expeditions, which every one must condemn as reprehenaible, and which would be ridiculous did not the courage and endurance of the misguided adventurers extort a kind of admiration. However, we are assured, and can well believe, that the people of the United States do not support these violations of the law of nations. To say nothing of higher motives, it would, seem that Americans are convinced that the possession of I these equatorial regions, and their admission into I the Union as States, would be a curse rather than a blessing. There is a zone to which men of European race must confine themselves in every part of the world. Whatever may be the physical vigour of Anglo-Saxons, or Irishmen, or Germans, they cannot hope to occupy the swamps and forest land of the Tropics with impunity. Central America and the West Indies may be cultivated by negro labour, slave or free, and a certain nber of whites may live in affluence and civilization as owners or overseers, or traders or professional men; but the bulk of the population can never be of our own race. If whites settle in numbers they must degenerate and become demoralized, and die out in the course of a generation or two. These things are too plain to escape the observation of thinking men on either side of the Atlantic, and consequently the Arericans, with the exception of the extreme Southern party and the fanatics for annexation at any price, have no desire for acquisitions on the Spanish Main. The Tropic of Cancer must be the limit of Anglo-American Republicanism. The path of civilization is westward, and the nation must obey its destinies. The true statesm_an doe not attempt to rule events, he merely watches and takes advantage of them. Every year thousands of acres are brought into cultivation far to the west of the Mississippi, and towns are rising on the most distant shores of Lake Superior. I The whole impulse of the country is westward along the belt of northern Free States. European immigrants flock as naturally towards Illinois and Iowa as the native-born lad from New England. To check or coatrol this movement merely by the promptings of political ambition is impossible, and the world may rejoice that it is so. We, in England, with a long experience of tropical possessions, have felt from the first that the scheme for converting into American States the neck of land which joins the two continents could have no root in any real national instinct. While, however, by the nature of things Central America must be left in the hands of its present possessors, yet England and the United States must always have the deepest interest in the tranquillity of the country. That Honduras, or Nicaragua, or Costa Rica ean ever occupy a high position in the world as States no one can believe. But they mnay yet be peaceable, prosperous, and respected. The Spaniards have adapted themselves to the country better than we ever should be likely to do, and they have not that antipathy to amalgamation with the Indian and African races which marks the Anglo-Saxon. They are certainly the fittest people to inhabit the country; at any rate, they are there, and we must make use of them. So to settle the Central American question must be our first object. The long disputes between the Union and this country are, perhaps, better understood by diplomatists than by the public. In America they have, no doubt, been followed with interest by the readers of newspapers, but we Englishmen, amid the multiplicity of our relations and the neverceasing succession of great questions, have paid but little attention to a region which we generally associate only with mahogany, rattlesnakes, and yellow fever. However, the question is reaJly important, simply because it has been made so by politicians. The aggressive designs of this "1 grasping monarchy" on Central America were, we will venture to say, the topic of some fifty thousand orations last 4th of July. We cannot but rejoice, then, that our Government has determined to settle the matter, so far as lies in its power. Sir WnmAm GORE OusELEy has been despatched to the United States, and will, it is said, be met in an amicable spirit by the Americau Cabinet. The chief subject of discussion will, of course, be the construction to be placed on the CLAYrroN-BaLwuL Treaty. It is well known that a party in the United States has seen with anger the Government at Washington bind itself never to occupy the Central American territory. Happily it is, we believe, only a party, and the great body of the public wiU be contented with a treaty establishing the neutrality of regions which as a possession can be useful to no one, but a free passage through which is necessary for the security of the world's commerce. The complaint that England still retains some rights on this coast is evidently frivolous. England has nothing but the little settlements which date back so many years, and which she has bound herself not to extend. The question has, no doubt, been complicated by the Filibustering expeditions, which have excited the American mind, and made it unwilling to consent to anything which seemed likely to check ths occupation and conquest of the country. However, as this excitement has now pretty well passed away, the sensible and equitable stipulations of the treaty are likely to be better appreciated. We sincerely trust that the two Governments will settle this matter speedily and permanently. The quarrels between these little Spanish States, their petty wars, their social disorganization, and now General WAixua's bucaniering, have delayed for years the great work which alone can give a value to this part of the world. A canal joining the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is every day becoming more and more a necessity. The Americans can hardly reconcile themselves to the notion that the route from New fork to San Francisco is always to be round Cape Horn; nor can we help seeing that the nearest way to our Australian Colonies is across the Gulf of Mexico. It seems now high time to thiik about this great work, which we believe was once proposed by the United States' Government and cordially approved by our own. But, whether the canal is to be in Nicaragua or at Panama, it is necessary that the whole region should be tranquillized, which can never be done as long as the bickerings between America and England allow sanguinary factions to be continually " pronouncing " in each unfortunate Republic.
The Charge of the Bishop of OXrORD is partly a retrospect and partly a manifesto; it is didactic, hortative, and pensive by tumns; at one stage his spirits droop as the recollection of " family griefs' comes over him, at another he " sounds the trum" pet, beats the drum," summons his followers, marshals them, and gives the word of commnand. It will not do for a leader of party to indulge in mnelancholy; his task is to be always cheerful, always lively, and always to see things in a bright light. He must do what the poets describe the sun as doing,-disperse the mists and fogs that overhang the ground, and bring daylight upon the scene. He doubtless sometimes finds this rather a difficult and irksome duty, and the process which enlivens and inspirits others is a heavy one to himsaif. How surprised would the innocent follower who retires from the interview cheered and exhilarated, and with the feeling of everything having been set to rights, often be if he knew how very differently his leader really felt on the subject I ATMnEws wa told by his physician to "go and hear McATws." But the political or religious chief has one duty in common with " Clown ;" he must bo always in good spirits; he must be so in spite of all the cares that weigh upon his heart. The Charge of an Episcopal leader is looked forward to by the party as a note of encouragement, a reviving strain, just as the cheer is looked forward 'to by soldiers; and the Bishop of OxPoRz is, from his oxtraordinary activity, in a position to wield this opportunity with advantage. A good worker is the best inspiriter. The Bishop of OXFORD cau appeal to large institutions erected in his diocess, to frequent confirmations, and to a constant intercourse with his clergy, not only public, but private. Some years ago we believe he could say what few Bishops could,-that he had preached in every church in his diocess. It is due to him to say that he set the example of a Bishop governing his diocess, not by correspondence, but by personal knowledge of his clergy-an example which has certainly done a good deal to raise the working efficiency of the English Bench. Yet no relation of leader and follower is ever perfect, especially in the religious sphere. A religious party wants twvo sorts of leaders-one exclusively religious, the other with a mixture of the secular in him. The latter is necessary to recommend the party and promote its principles in mixed society, and among men of the world and men of station. But, though both of these leaders together work not amiss, neither of them gives perfect satisfaction by himself. To the one leader the party says-" It is true you are a very sincere man, "but you are a hermit; you do us no good with "the world at large, bat, on the contrary, repel " them by your severe looks ;" to the other the party says-" It is true you are an admi" rable man of the world, but you are rather more " a man of the world than we like." Thus one leader is too much of a hermit, and the other rather too little of one; the one is too rigid, and the other too accommodating. Some of the Bishop of OXFORD'S party are said to give vent occasionally-having first looked out of the window, shut the door, and thrown a glance up the passage, to see that nobody is listening-to low soft murmurs of apprehension, like the breathings of an A'olian harp, that his Lordship is not a perfect enthusiast. The Bishop is, we have no doubt, aware of this gentle undercurrent, and, in return for the reflection upon his sincerity, has his own secret estimate of the understanding of many of his followers. We do not want to say anything to undermine these sawed relationships, to damp a generous mutual confidence, or to dim a glowing and attractive picture, but we cannot help suspecting that the connexion of religious leader and follower is often apt to partake more or less of this drawback,-the follower thinking that the leader has rather too much of the wisdom of the world, and the leader thinking that the follower has too little of that wisdom, and of every other as well. With every inclination to stand neutral between these two comparisons we must yet confess to a slight bias in favour of the latter of the two. A man who is charged with the interests of a religious party in the general field of society must be a man of remarkable intelligence, address, and readiness. He mustbeamanof large sympathies, able to understand different systems and minds and characters, and to recognize truth under different forms. He must have this breadth of mind, otherwise he is of no use whatever to the party the instrument of which he is, forno man of the world will give himself the trouble to listen to a narrow-minded partisan, however sincere and fervent, who can enter only into his own set of subjects and confined standard. But such a person as this must not be expected to be an unmixed enthusiast,-it is not his nature, it is not his mission. The Bishop of OX2ORD makes a bold use indeed of this largeness of ground; he does everything with a swing. Hear him at scientific or literary mieetings, and you imagine you are hearing a " Broad Church"-man. He expands into the widest schemes of Christian comprehension, he adopts the language of the Church of the future, he admits everybody into his communion, and tallks of the whole company, which embraces, perhaps, every denomination under the sun, from Romanism to Sandemanianism, as one Christian brotherhood. But listen to his next charge, or sermon, or speech at a dioceean society meeting, and he is reduced again to the limited dimensions of orthodoxy. He is an Anglo-Catholic divine, quoting the Fathers, upholding tradition, urging ceremonial, and fervently entreating his hearers earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, and to hold fast the form of sound words. Such a double aspect is open to criticism, and leads to the question, which is the true Bishop of OXFORD,-the one in society, or the one in the pulpit, the general converser, or the earnest preacher ? But, perhaps, after all, his Lordship only does on a large scale, and with the bold, impetuous swing and exuberant speech characteristic of him, what the most intelligent members of his party do on a smaller scale and with less effectiveness and power. We believe the Bishop to be as rigid a High Churchman as a man can be who mixes a great deal with the world and has general sympathies. But the truth is, most of our High Churchmen-at least, the thoughtful part of them-hold their principles a good deal in solution. This is the tendency of the age. We in this nineteenth century are Baconians; we go by facts, and if we see that, as a matter of fact, excellent Christians are to be found in all schools and parties, we begin to acquiesce in a comprehensive religion. The Bishop of OxroRD knows perfectly what the claims of his party are upon him, and he will fulfil them zealously and effectively. He wiU stand up for High Churchmanship in the House of Lords on every occasion; he wil denounce State supremacy, and fire up at the lay insolence of Prime 3Iinisters and AttorneysGeneral. All this belongs to his position as a religious party leader, and he throws himself into the execution of tho duties which the position brings upon him. We do not mean to say at all that he does not reaUy believe in the system which he advocates; we have no doubt he does-he certainly appears to perform all these services con amore, and it would be most unjust to call him a counterfeit HighChurchman. His liberal language is the more likely of the tvo to be a counterfeit, and if he cheats anybody it is the savans. But we do not like hard interpretations, and had rather believe that the Bishop, with all his High Churchmanship, does not at the bottom of his heart think that his own father, of whom he is o justly proud, was a heretic-a concession which singly would commit him to a very considerable omprehensiveness. The fact is there are so many infuences at work in our modern free system, there is such a conflict of light from aU quarters, every branch of evidence is allowed such play, and ihe contact with different, and at first unwelcome truths, *s so forced upon all of us, whether we will or no, that many a nominal partisan holds his favourite dogma in solution.

AGRIOULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIEES. Slr,-I trust that your "miserable criticisms" on Mr. Disraeli's speech at Amersham will awaken the entlemen of England to some sense of shame at the beggarly proceedings of most of our agricultural asociations. I am not going to decry agricultural asociations as much, or to deny them the merit of attempting, if not of achieving, some useful functions in connexion with rural economy. All country people and most cockneys have something to say about farming, andit is reasonable to supposethattheinterchange of ideas which takes place at these annual gatherings may tend to the removal of prejudices, and to the introduction of improvements into that all-important branch of industry. Nor do I see any reason why ploughing matches and other trials of skill in agriculture should not be placed on the same footing as horseracing, cricketing, and other national and manly exercises which have been from time immemorial the characteristics of country life. These are mere physical contests, in which victory Is the real prize, and its token-whether a laurel wreath or a sllver medal-a matter of comparative indifference. But when agricultural associations transgress these limits, and undertake the very delicate office of rewarding merit, they may fairly be asked, " What hast thou to do with another man's servant ? To his own master he standeth or falleth." What business have you, my Lord Huntingbox, and you, Squire Harkaway, and you, Farmer Smallbeer, or any number of you, to insult my old carter George Styles, who has lived with me 40 years, by saying to him-" Styles, you appear to be an honest man, or your master would probably not have kept you so long. You have brought up 10 children, without costing the parish a farthing, and it is to be hoped you have taught them the duty of maimtaining you when you are too old for work. Such men as you are scarce, and deserve to be encouraged; so here are 20s. with which we present you as a reward for your good conduct, and as a mark of our approval." Why, Sir would not Styles, if he had a particle of selt-respect, reply,-"My Lord and gentlemen, I am infinitely obliged to you for the good opinion you have been pleased to express of me, but I must decline to accept your money. If I deserve any reward for 40 years' good service my master is the proper person to bestow it upon me, and I am sure if times go hard with me he wili not let me want; but if not, gentlemen, as I have not had the honourI of working for you, you must excuse me for saying that you had better keep your favours for those on whom you are better entitled to bestow them." I want to knowv why the agricultural labourer is to be placed on a lower footing in the scale of respectability than the domestic or any other menial servant ? What would be tsiught of a body of gentlemen and ladies who should form themselves into a committee for the purpose of rewarding their neighbours' cooks and footmen? Would it not be deemed a piece of intolerable impertinence ? And if this be so, I ask why should the agricultural labourer, who is nothing but an outdoor servant, be treated as though he were the property of the community at large, and hod no master of his own who cared for him or was able to do him justice ? The fact is, Sir, that this system of coaxing and petting the labourer was invented as a cloak to cover the hardships and tyranny of the Poor Law of 1834. It was the sop thrown to him by those who were foremost in traducing the character of the whole labouring population, and consigning them when infirm or out of work to the worse than prison discipline of the workhouse. The labourer was then regarded as an eneumbrance on the land, to be got rid of as best might be. " Workhouse fare or emigration" was the alternative offered him by the landowner. Well, he has taken the hint and gone. There is no complaint of too much labour in the market nowadays. So let me recommend the " fine old English geatleman" to treat those who remain with more respect than is iaplied in the offer of these paltry doles, and not delegate to agricultural associations the duty which can only be properly discharged by each individual for himself. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A BERKSHIRE FARgER.

TO TEIE EDITOR OF TEH TrMES. Slir,-The noble letter of "A Hertfordshire Incumbent,;' which appeared in your impression yesterday morning, and from which the above passage is estracted, has, I doubt not, been read by thousands with the interest which this all.absorbing subject demands. It is a very healthy sign of the present times that public opinion is aU but unanimous on the subject of the desirableness, and our paramount duty as a Christian nation to propagate Christianity throughout British India. Thank God, the age of " timidity" is not likely to return soon. The system of discouraging missionary efforts would not be tolerated for a moment, even if clvil governors could be found rash enough to attempt it. At the same time, it would be neither vise nor politic for the Indian Government, as a Government,to step forward and take the initiative in the great work of evangelizing the heathen in India, or, indeed, take any active part in it in its official capacity. All that is asked on behalf of the Gospel In India is fair play. We want no favour. Fair play we have a right to demand, and, as a Christian people, we ought not to be satisfied without it. I believe that we are now, as a Church and people, so conscious of our past neglect, and sufficiently awakened to a sense of our duty in respcot of India, that the active steps towards evangelizing that eountry can be safely left to the consciences of Individual Christians and the agency of missionary societies already existing. In declining the dlrect interference of the State, whether represented by the Home or Indian Government, I am far from supposing that it is not the duty of individnal members of the Government to encourage and substantially aid the movement. I would have all who are placed in igh offlicial positions proclaim that they are alive to the duty of spreading the blessings of Christianity throughout India. From our beloved Sovereign on the throne to her lowest officer in every department of State I would have all ?roclaim in a manner not to be misunderstood that this duty must be discharged if we are to expect God's blessing upon us in future. To come now to the practical part of mny letter. We now seem to see our way to the suppression of the Indian mutiny, and many hearts, now bowed down by the weight of the affliction will soon, I trust, be filled with joy and gratitude that the evil day is gone by. No doubt we shall have a day of national thanksgiving to acknowledge God's mercies for the past, and to supplicate Hia blessing for the future. What more convenient season for thanking God in deeds as well as in words. Let there be coUections in every church throughout the kingdom on that day for the extension of our Indian missions. Let our two great missionary institutions receive such an amount of contributions as will enable them at once to send forth a "' great multitude" of preachers to British India, and let us no longer be open to the charge of neglecting the souls of our heathen feUow-subjects in that land of spiritual darkness. But in order to create a still greater amount of interest in this all-momentous subject there should be a public meet. ing in the largest building that can be found in London a few days previous to the national Thanksgiving Day. In 1851, when the third jubilee of the Society for the Propag3' tion of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was inaugurated, the Prince Consort presided over a public meeting held in St. Martin's-hall. The speakers were Lord John Russell, Earl Grey, Duke of Newcastle, Mr. Sidney Herbert, and others eminent in Church and State. Why shotuld not the same thing be done again ? Why not inaugurate the revival, or rather theextensionof Christian missions bya monster meetIngin Westminster-hall, the largest buiding I know of in London ? And I respectfully ask if there is any reason of State policy why our Most Gracious Qaeen should not be seen this time seated by the side of her Royal Consort. Let all our leading public men take a part in the proceedings of the meeting. Let all the Bishops ba seen within those time. honoured walls, and I, for one, believe that a million of money might be raised by members of the Church of England within the next fewv months for the purpose of spreading Christianity in India. No fraud need be practised, no force or violence need be resorted to. Only let it be publicly proclaimed that we care for the souls of our feUowsubjects in India, and that we seek by fair means to do them good, and doubt we that our exertions will be in vain? MIay we not hope that they wiUl return in rich blessings upon our own heads? Pray, Sir, let your powerful voice be heard in support of this movement. You have already done good service to the cause of Christianity iu India, the timne for action wiU soon be upon us. Another opportunity may not be offered to us. If we neglect it now we may not have, as we certainly shall not deserve to have. auiothe? b.1 A COUNTRY INCUMBENT. Nov. 3.

DUBLIN, TuaswAy MoRMWa; -.Le grana.. masserx- resumed their deliberatlox yesterday afternoon, but aa yet the official, result of their counsels, in the usual form of a report, his not met the light. Sir Wiliam Verner, one of the members for Armagh, and not the Earl of EnaskiUlen, was in the chair on the firt day, and on the second day Viscount Dungannon presided. It is rumoured that after all the high-sounding notes of preparation for an outburst of Orange indignation, the attendance has been by no means as numerous or inluential as might reasonably have been anticipated. THE INDAN }ELIE FUND. The county of Galway meets on Saturday next for the purpose of expressing abhorrence of the massacre of our fellow- subjects and of the atrocious crimes committed by the revolted Sepoys and others in lndia, and of promoting a subscription in aid of those who have been deprived of their fortunes and their prospects by the events which have taken place inwthat country. The requisition to the figh Sheriff is most numerously signed, and embraces the names of a great number of the Roman Catholic laity of the upper and middle classes, but not a single clergyman of that persuasion has had the moral courage to encounter the displeasure of the Papal delegate by affixing his signature to the document, and thereby expressing his concurrence in the objects of the meeting. THE PRESSUE ON THE IRISH BEAIS. TheDerryJournal has the following statement with respect to the sound state of the local bank in that city:- "'With respect to our local banks, a very absurd rumour has been afboat for the last 10 days, for whioh there is not a shadow of foundation. We have hitherto abstained from referring to it, believing that its absurdity would soon put an end to any agitation upon the subject; but, as we find our Belfast contemporaries have referred to the partial excitement that has existed, we may as well state our entire confidence in the perfect security of every one of the banks in this province-founding this strong opinion, in the first place, upon the sound, careful manner in which these banks are conducted; secondly, upon the known fact that no one of them has made any losses, but, on the contrary, that they are all possessed of la-ge accumulated profits; and thirdly, upoa the known respectability of their large proprietaryevery one of the proprietors being responsible to the ful extent of his property, no matter how smaU his interest in the bank of which he is a shareholder.

STATE OF NORTH TIPPERARY. The following account of the state of the North Riding appears in the morning papers:- " On Monday night a man named White, who is a servant in the employment of the Rev. George Handeock, vicar of Bourea, near Templemore, was attacked on tho road near his residence and received a blow of a stone on the head, which caused a severe fracture. No cause can be assigned for this wanton offence, as the man is a stranger in the locality and his master most popular in the district, except the revival of the old spirit of mischief and a demonstration in favour of the withdrawal of the police force, this being the third outrage that has occurred in a narrow circle since one of the re' cently adjoining policestations hasbeen closed. The meeting to be held on the 11th inst. in Nenagh, to consider the redistbution of the constabulary, after 330 of theforoehave been removed from the North Riding, is considered to be on the principle of shutting the stable door when the steed i gone It is the general opinion that 'the boys of Tipperary' are determined to take the suggestion about the 'longwinter nights,'notwithstanding the heavy sentences inalic ted by the learned justice who presided in the criminal court at the last assizes."

TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES. Sir,-May I, through the columns of The Times, be per. mitted to ask for a solution of what at present is to me an enigma? I have for the last 30 years examined recruits for both the militia and the line, and, perhaps, during that period tbousands have been inspeoted by me. I therefore may fairly lay Claim to some experience in the matter. To my astonishment lately nunmbers whom I had passed were on presenting themselves at the office in Westminster cursorily examined, and with the simple statemenb ' medi. cally unfit" rejected. Scarcely are these men out of the office when a recruiting sergeant steps up, and intimates " it is all right; come again to-morrow and you will be passed." Sume do go and are passced, and others of the " medically unfit" Be to Colcbester, are at once accepted, and arc at the present timel doing duty in the camp. Some wghose warlike ardorr is of an evanescent character, prefer returning to thelr villages, and decline the " bubble repultation e'en at the cannon's mouth." s\ow, Sir, I wisb to know why these are rejeoted in the first place, or if "medically unfit' they are urged to make a second attempt and then passed. Am I to draw the illiberal inference that the oxaminer has a wish to serve some friend by rejecting eligible men, in order that the candidate for a commlssion may easily pick them up snd thus coiiiplete his quota ? There must be eomething Iotten in the state of Denmark. I aiu, Bir, your obedient sPpv4+. G.LEY, Nov. U.
A ST LAY2A SHIRE UNION of MECHA.ICS' INSTITUTES.| On Wednesday evening the Lord Bishop of Manchester 1resided a; the first annLal distribution of prizes and certificAtes awarded by the Council of the East Lancashire iUnion of Mechanics' and other institutes. The distribution took place in tho assembly teoom of the Burnley Mechanics' Xustitutiun, in presence of upwards of 1,000 persons. On the Wlatform were Sir J. l'aklngtoa, ALP.; lr. W. Cowper, 3LP.; Sir J. ID. Kay-Shuttlewrorth; Colonel W. Patten, 3[.P.; Lord Cavendish, MP'.; Colonel Towneley, High 'heriff of Laucashire, and other local promoters of popular *pducation. The Bishop of lAB.:E(EsTZRP, in commaencing the pro*Wdings, said,-The present moveraent is orne peculiarly Ar%tiIying, both in the manner in which it has been com3nenced in its present aspect, and in the prospect which It mems to have before it. One hundred institutions engaged ucation have now combined ; upwards of 22,000 of Lh.ir members are reaping the advantage of this union; and it strack myslf, and one or two others, as it also occmrved, by a happy coincidence, to my friend Sir J. Kay1huttleworth, that it might be desirable to hold local ex0mainatiovs in different' parts of the union, where rizes ,-ught be given to those who distingnished themselves Cy proticieacy in the several branches of studv. That scheme has been commaenced and has answered; i85 pupils the other day were examined in Manchester, and prize, were listributed by the great promoter of mechanics' institutes, the venerableLordBrougham. (Eear.) Iunderstandfrom the xeport ot the inspector of schools that the examination on the W1resent occasion has been in every way most satisfactory. If ether were any cause for disappointment I should find It 2n the fact that the number of these who have competed Jias been so smalL I cannot help thinking that when the mature of this examination is more clearly understood, when its multifarious advantages are more sensibly felt, we -shall have a much larger numcbr of competitors. (Hear.) at was by examinations of this kind that the University of Vambridge emerged, in the early part of the present century, from the long and lethargic sleep in which It hai sunk, mad rope to the high and proud position which it at present Iolds in the estination of the learned world. (Hear, hear.) a regret to find, from the report of the examiner here, and from nmy own experience elsewhere, that one of the weakest points in the instrcttion of the different candidates is a grammatical and accurate knowledge of the English lan. guage. It has been pressed by high authority upon the council that they should endeavour to give, not merely rewards for proficiency in several branches, but that they should also seek as far as possible to ctlitivate success in any one branch. No doubt accurate knowledge in one branch is infinitely preferable to Stiperficial knowledge in several, and, at all events, a do trust the council will require a solid substratum of acourate hnowledge of their mother tongue before they mlow candidates to proceed to anything else. (Applause.) There is one circumstance on which I may most truly convratulate the union. It is the admirable selection of sub. 3ects which has been made. I really believe that one of the main nauses of the want of adequate attendance at our schools has been the utterly useless and unmanageable nature cof a large portion of the instruction imparted there. It is little if we make a ild an accurate eographer, if we do not instruct him in the geographlca beanngsof the country in which he lives. it is little if he know the length of the Mississippi and Missouri, or the point of jtunotion of the Jumna and the Ganges, If he cannot trace clown your own river hero until it mixes itself vwith the Ribble, aLd pours itself at List into the sea. (Hear, hear.) I cannot retrain from also alluding to the care which has been sedulously taken, without interfering in the slightest degree with the rights of religious feeling, to recognize in one book esDecially recommended those great elements without which mian's education is imperfect indeed. 3fost wiFely did your council judge when they selected iPaley's Natural T/woloyy to be one of the subjects of ecxsmination. Most wisely did you judge in not shrinking from encouraging the student to read the book of nature and read it aright with a reference to the visdom, skill, and power of its great Author. The mext point I would mention in reference to the examiliation is that this institution being in its infancy, the standard miist necessarily be low at first. 'The council have most wisely observed this, and extended the limits to take in n larger proportion of candidates for prizes than they at first intended. This encouragement, I trust, wiL be Iet by increased activity and exertions, What is the position of the young men ohom lam now addressing? If the elective tranchise is, as some say-mark, I do not smy whetber rightly or wrongly, for I am not talking lpoitics here-to be extended, is it not important that an educated ndd vwell directed population shall be the parties Xto sw.ay the power which it pleases Almighty God to place in their hands (Applsuse.) You have high vrocatiOns and l3oly duties before you, if you will not shrink from them, and the young men to whom I am about to present the przes aro, I trust, but a first sheaf of the rich harvest that as to follow. (Applause.) Big Lordship then proceeded with the distribution. ?rirzes of money, varying from 15s. to 41., were given to 15 students, and certificates of merit were awarded to four otherF. Colonel TONV-TFLXY moved the first resolution: "That leom eight to 13 years of age chldrea employed in mill rVend only half their tuie In echooL and at 13 leave the school for Mill vtork. That children on whom the half.tlimesytem is not obIJgator hv law cominoDls are m.uch lees regular In tbeix attendance at echOO' thantbehalitimescholars, aundforthenoes psrt leave schoolataa earlir age than IS. That It Is de!irable to induce the scholan of dav schools to ccutinue their education by attendance on eveniog ciaeel when thpy leave the day sobools, and to enter mechancs' and Utie. .rary Iustitutions when they are of ripe ace for instruction." Sir J. P. KAY S.l1suLLZVORTII seconded the resolution. wMter bearing his personal testirnony to the admirable demeanour of the young men who had b'een examined as candidates for the prizes now distributed, he said,-I am persuaded from the demeanour of these young men that a very great number were deterred, from appearing purely by a very modest estimate of their own merits, and 3 am very glad to say that there lies on the table a lietter from Mr. Kennedy, the inspector, stating that not only did the papers of the candidates exhibit a much egreater degree of merit than he had expected to find, but that lie did himself receive the same impression that I and every other person present in the room received, that the ecfect of their training on their moral character and ibeanir6 was in all respects ad mirable. I say these words of iencouragenient because I trust that on the next occasion a ,much larger number of candidates will assemble from the -very unn,erous body of students In the 12 institutions ,which frirm the East Lancashire Union, and that instead of 20 or ;P candidates we shall have at least 100. While this inim is entitled one of "mechanics' and other lInstitutions," the declaration of its objects, put lorth at its foundation, contained a distinct intimation that it was intended to include evening schools, whether connected with mechanics' institutes or 'having a separate existence, provided they were in a state of elhlciency. The disposition of the council of the union Is not to frame regulations of exclusion, but rather to frame theni on the most generous principle of comprehensionnot to surround themselves with an atmosphere of repulsion, but to make the union as attractive as pos2ibe. i Applause.) Nor do I think It beyond the limits of the consideration of the council that they should adnmit to the examination men who, unable toattend classes, are, by praiseworthy and self-guided efforts, striving in the diflcult path of knowledge to raise themselv,s in the scale of moral beings. (Hear, hear.) In the founedation of this union the first consideration that presented itself to us was that all the efforts for the efficient educatiou of the working classes, having been made of late years, are necessarily deficient in some main elements. There is a deficiency of schools, the schools are Imperfect, there is irregularity in the attendance, and there are the liiits to the school age. I shall only allude to a few of the more prominent statistics to show that we are still in a very imperfect state as to education, especially in England. According to the late census, the total number of children in England and Wales lbetween the ages of 5 and 15 was some few thousands over ,000,6t0o. The number on the books of private and public schools was little more than 2,000,000. It is to be inferred that tle amount ot schooling does not exceed four years, and for a great part of the population does not even exceed three years. Nearly 11100,000 children between 5 and 12 were not attending schools, whose absence could not be -explained by llness, work, or home instruction. Besides this lamentable fact, it was found that a very large numrbtr leave school as early as 10 years of age througho,t the agriculturaldistricts, and U years ia the manufauturing districts, and where they remain longer it is chietly owing to their being restrained by the Pactory lecgulation Act. The irregularity of attendance Is proved biy facts like the following :-Out of 4,800 schools inspected 5in order to see If they were wortby of the capitation grant 1,09; recei ved its aid, and of tiie 102,364 scholars in them 4only a i tl9, or 36 per cent., came within the conditions requlirmrg an attendance of 176 days in the year. What are the cau,ta of these sad results? I have heard them attributed in great measure to the moral indifl'erence of parents, their overty, and to the great demand for juvenile labour*; and nths een argued that the advantages of education boing hfetly mnoral, intellectual, and social, it cannot be expected §that they should be appreciated by apopulation not generally educated in the last generation. It hasbseneadihcu siderable justice that you ask a man easaidg with nes.s- ear idcfo S.t ins,perwrec t gie u, fr example, under the factory n-ystem, one-hal the timue of his children from eight to 13 years of age, or 2.3 years, when tbe average earnings of the child in each year will be 71., and the loss will be ,1. 1Os., bIesides, perhaps, 8s. for the cost of schooling, making it mearly 4?. per annum for each child. It has been also urged 'that iou cannot expect a man who has not received the advantages of education to continue his child at school from 13 to 15, when in his district, at half time, he would lose 71. 10s., or, at full time, about 151. a-year. The loss is im. maediate, the gain is prospectve anud remote. Seeing that this Is tLe cost to the working man, it is natural to ask what ico the promoters of schools and the Government pay, in the lbest- conducted schools, for each scholar ? Do they give to the 2nass of the working classes satisfactory evidence that they attach a greater value to education than the working man limsi-If? 1 ho statistics of schools inspected by tbe Govern. ment ofiTmers prove that the promoters of schools pay, on the avtr. age, about 10s. per annum for each scholar in the best com ducted schools, and the Government itself does not pay more than 12s. per annum. I have already said that the parents pay from s. to 's. per annum for each scholar. What, the ni, can be done by the promoters of education amnong the middle classes, and by the State tself, to produce a general conviction that they attach to education the value they profess for it? In the first instance, it seems to me that the promoters of schools inight, by their own individual exertions, personal Qxamnpi., curstant visits to the schools, and endearouring to gave a tho-roughly practical aim to the schools, so as to make them itRuence not merely the success in life, but all the moral aitris of the working men's characters, and by exhibitions l f personal sympathy of this kind, give direct evidence of their concern for education. I think also, if employers were more generally to selet their clerks and confidential Eservants from the most distinguished pupils in the schools they c-uld offer a much largser reward tian they could by xay other system, and a greater proof of their own confidence in education. (Cheers.) J have heard it said that the middle classes, beyond the political and religious objects whioh they have in view, have not hitherto given any such prominent proof of their interest and confidenoe in the education of the psop16 as to inrease the confidence of the people themselves. have heard intelligent and able men insist that this state of things is almost a necessity,-that we cannot have agreat manufacturing system, and at the same time a highly educated people; that we cannot under-sell all other nations, and command all markets by means of cheap labour, and yet educate our own people efficiently, and it has been argued that we must improve education within the limits assigned by our commercial pre-eminence. I do not believe any such doctrine, but hold that if we regard the wealth andc resources of this great country we shall come to a totally oppo- site conclusion. Among the impediments to the success of 1 our school system, we have first the fact that the population has not had the advantage of one generation of education. We have alsn the great demand for the labour of children created by our manufactuting system, and, though time is proving that the calculations of economists as to the effect of the Short-time Act orn the labour of women and children were utterly erroneous, atill there lingers a very strong impression that that inte2ference was not perfectly and economically just. Now, I ask, are we to presume that we have to pay the price of the ignorance and sensuality which now exist in our population for our command of the markets of the world? I am perfectly convinced that we have not. I think it only necessary to point to the single fact of the constant effect which improvements in machinery have to free us from all the embarrassments which economists have predicted concern'ng our career to anticipate the most auspicious results. I iind throughout Yorkshire, as is reported both by factoryand school inspectors, that the disuse of the labour of women and children in mills is con stantly proceeding, and I believe it is proceeding to a considerable extent in this district; and in like manner we find that oar seial advances are constantly promoted by scientific results which were not within the original reckoning of economists. I thlnk I might with confidence remiind you of the vast wealth accumulated under our manufacturing system. We have only to look abroad, through this neighbourhood, and see how every valley gives evidence of the accumulation of capital-how we are building great cities on every side of us, multiplying vast factories, and proofs of wealth of every kind-building ports, and sending fleets all over the world; and in this state of things we have to ask ourselves whether, being the wealthiest nation of the world, we cannot pay for the schooling of 4,000,000 of children for three or five years more. The truth Is that, upon the most accurate calculation, that might not cost us more than 2,00001. a-year,and we are at the presentmoment expend. ing on various other things a muchlarger sum. Some years ago Mr. Porter stated that 58,000,OOOl. per annum was expended, chidfly by the labouring classes, on beer, spirits, and tobacco, and while we expend about 3,500,0001. oni the repressive forces of crime, the cost of depredations may be estimated at about 6,250,0001., and the cost of pauperism in' this country is about 6,000,0001. per annum. Out of the vast mass of expenditure that I might detail to you, surely we might save 2,000,0001. for the education of the people! (Cheers.) Then, I ask, what attractions can be offered? No employer of labour who has witneseed the effect of the more efficient schools in this district wmll deny that the school makes the children more docile, more intelligent, more careful of property, less turbulent, more contented, more conscientious, more prudent, and brings them up in less sensual habits than they would otherwise be. Moreover, we have not yet entered vigorously on the great question of the reform of our en. dowed charities, by which young men of abilitv were to be enabled to pass through college, or be apprentieed to trades. These charities have been wasted or misused, and if properly applied they might induce the working-men of this country to keep their cbildren much longer at school. Then there is the subjeot of Government patronage. Of late years competitive examinations have been introduced in certain branches of the civil service to prevent the bestowal of appointments on purely unworthy objects, but it has not been adopted so as to give to the parents of scholars attending elementary schools a clear conception that by the proficienoy of their chlldrea In those schools, and oy their subsequent attendance in evening classS, they might have a chauce of rising through successive stages of a career in the Government service, which would afford them greater advantages than those which are within the ordinary sphere of their exertions. There are Ino less than 12,618 offices, worth from 501. to 801. a-year, in the Excise, Customs, and Post-office; the annual vacancies are from 700 to 800, and the appointments are chiefly on the recommendation of mem. bers of Parliament. It is quite obvious that if Instead of application being made to members of Parliament for their recommendation of suitable persons, so that the distribution is chiefly guided by political motives, it were made to the managers of schools, or such institutions as the present, a direct incentive would be offered for the continued attendance of children and young men in the classes. (Applause.) Of these departments, at from 601. to IOC'l. per annum, about 300 become vacant every year, and they give a very fair prospect of a rising salary to 3001. a- year, acd out of those who attain to 3001. a-year the most meritorious may be promoted to offices varying from 3001, to 6001. a-year. Now, I say if we would convince the working classes that we are thoroughly in earnest as to their education, and that we value an educated people for itself, and are determined to offer the largest amount of stimulus in our power to the growth of the sentiment among the working classes that education Is reaUy a good, then, as employers of labour, we ought to select the mosb deserving young men from the schools for Promotion to our employment ; and, as aState, we should be careful to exercieShtato patronage not to produce political servility, but to produce the most earnest efforts on the part of the parents of scholars to better the condition of their children by Improving their moral and intellectual condition. (Cheers.) Let us contemplate what would become of us in this country if there were an insurrection of the slaves in the souithern States of America, and no cotton crop for two years. We should have to spend millions of money in the support of this population. And should we not have to rely on their confidence in the law and in everybody about them, and on their power to appreciate the nature of such a crisis? Most certainly we should. letme suppose another case, and I say it is not without the bounds of possibility. What if we had to spend 100,000,0001. in repeling a foreign invasion? In such a case as that we should need a devoted population, a people every man of whom would stand by is hearth with the feeling that he had in his master and in every order of society above him those who were just to hi'm, sympathizing, who had exerted their wealth and influence and the whole power of their station for his benefit, and who had not looked with a narrow thought upon any part of his condition, but had determined to make bim not merely a servant, but a man. (Great cheering.) The resolution was carried unanimously. Lord CAVENNDISH, MY.P, in moving the next resolution, said he believed, whatever system of primary education might be ultimately adopted In schools for children, we must at all times greatly depend upon the system of mechanics' or similar institutes for the education of the working population. (Hear.) He thought It very probable that much of the disappointment experienced in the working of theseinstitutions wastraceable tothe fact thatwehad notyet made use of all the means in our power to render them effective. He was disposed to regard the competitive examinations now beiog introduced as amost important auxiliary in that direction, looking at the great results which had foLlowed the adoption of that s.stem in the University of ambridge, where the most learned professors in the world gave iostruction to the wealthier classes of England. (Applause.) The resolution was as followvs:- That by means otfan Impartial examination the proficiencyof the put,!! of such institutions wf hbe tted4 and proofs given of Dersevering application and ability, which'wiU be accurately deSned In coet-. floates ,t, be awarded by the examiners of the BEet Lancashire Union to al who can produce tesmontalwot rsspiotabllty.^ Colonel PATTBN, M.P., seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. Mr. W. CowryR, M.P, in Proposing the next resolution, said he regarded the proceedings of the East Lancashire Union as of a very important character relative to the extension of national education. As he scarcely hoped to see the sehool-age of children greatly lengthened, he rejoiced to find that provision was being made for their instraction by means of evening classes from the time they engaged in labour. If those who were interested in education were toeconfine themselves to the encouragement of primar schools they would have been occupying them selves only with that which was the basis of public education, and entirelEy kept ohut oef siugtht the necessary superstructure, (Ap- "That ash° attendanDc on eceningi edicola or mutua ninutaction EOoeE,is and on mec^hanics' and lltenai Institutions, is a sign of a ,esguar and correct life-A means ot mental an moa DOl Improvement, anDi of prepabraIon for all the duties of life." The R1ev. Mr. KEa2sxny, one of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools (who had acted as examiner of the students to whom prizes were awarded on this occasion), seconded the resolution. He said he considered institutions of this kcind all-important and invaluable. One fact which his expe-i rience had deeply impressed upon him, though one on which he knew all persons did not agree with him, wras thei great importance of the labour of the young. He believed it was a thing we could not dispense with. He wished to educate them, hut we needed their labour in the field, the factory, the mine, for their owrn home, and for the country at large. now, then, was this dilemma to he overcome? lTe be- lievec it was by evening classes and such institutions as this. And if he should ever live to see these classes universally established throughout Lancashire, and well supported, he believed he should also see the interesting population of that county the best educated people in Great Britain, for their intelligence was equal to their independence. (Cheers.) The resolution was unanimously agreed to. Sir J. PA KINGTON, who was received with loud applause, said,-I have been asked to propose to you the next reso. lutton, and I find the terms of it so important, and they command so entirely my individual sanction that I could not hesitate to accede to the request:- "That to encoiuage young Persons who sire proof of a sober sad thoughtful life by attending evening clasee-, aud especialy such of them as may h y abillty and pereeverance gain Prizes and certificates, It is Important that employers of labcur should pay grest res5ect to such certltcates in selecting young persons for employment and promotion, and that such desersing men have a strong claim to be nominated to compete for oli>cee in the Exlse,Csustoms,Iulnad Revenue, Post-oflice, and othf, departments. irrespective of selection by means of PEaismentary p..tronage"T I hope that this resolution wil beunanimously adopted. It tells you that you are not invited here to competefor these prizes for the sake of mere personal display, or in order to gratify the vanity and love of distinction which is reckoned among the weakness of human nature, but which bas been for wise purposes implanted by Pzovidence in a greater or less degree in every human breast. Bear in mind that the objects this institution has in view are of a higher and more endurirg character. It is desired that by success in this competition you may lay a sure foundation for an honourable life hereafter. (Applause.) I cannot address such an audience as this without being reminded that I have sat in the House of Commons with men whom I have felt proud to number among my personal friends in public life, who commenoced their career as factory-boys. (Cheers.) I du not hold out to every one who comes to this table to receive a prize that you can hope to rise to similar wealth ar similar honours, but you may feel the assurance, or tla t,4 dt ycmr life, of tbpogt, g eminent and endauing advantages, respectability and competence. (Cheers.) Those you are sure of, and you maygain muchmore. This resolution Indicates two means by which this success in gaining prizes is to be made the chanuel for acquiring greater and higher advantages. The first is that these certificates placed in your hands may be the means of insuring to you the preference of employers. While I agree with vwhat Mr. ennedy has said in hoping to see some such syatem made universal and compulsory, I do in the meantime entertain the most sanguine hope that by a generous and intelligent co-operation on the part of employers these certificates may be made of the greatest value to those who hold them, and a means of the greatest encouragement to education. (Cheers.l But this resolution points to another means of attainmg these ends, and I do hope that the adoption of this resolution in the resence of my right hon. friend will draw the attention of Her Majesty's Government to this most importaut object, that it may at no distant day be broadly and distinctly laid down that those who gain these prizes and hold these certificates shall thereby have the right to compete for places in the civil service (cheers),-not as a matter of favour or patronage, or as the result of coming cap in hand to the member for the county ("hear, hear," and laughter) or the borough, and saying i humble tone, "Will you be kind enough, Sir, to recommend me as a persoun who may compete 7" (laughter), but that these men hereatter shall come armed with their honest prize or certificate, and say, as a matter of right, "I have trinmphed in myfirst competition, and now I claim to be admitkd to the competition where I maay be held com,petent to serve say country as a member of the civil service. (Cheers.) In reference to the object for which we are assembled, I entirely agree in thinking that union is strength in the case of mechanics' institutions. If you want proof, you have only to cross the border Into the neighbouring county of York, and there you *3il find abundant demonstration of the advantages which arise from these combinations. I most earnestly advise all working men, especialy the younger portion, to do al they can for the support and encouragement of mechanics' institutes. (Cheers.) Perhaps the fact that I am a resident in an agri cultural district makes me more sensible than you are here of the advantages in this respect to be derived from a densely populated country. We have mechanics' institutes in the part of England in which I dwell, but they are chiefly frequented by adults, for recreation, and I am sorry to say very little frequented at all. We find it difficult to niaintain them, because, instead of being, as you are, congregated in vast masses, our pepulation is comparatively thin. I agree with your lords hip, and amy friend Sir J. Ray Shuttleworth, that the progress of publlc events makes it day by day more pressingly important that the intellect of the great masses of our people should be duly cultivated. (Cheers.) I don't believe you can have a better means of cultivating theni at present than these Institutions afford and I believe you have in your classes here abundant proof that working-men may thus supply the deficiencies of previous instruction. On the other hand, even if we had a more satisfactory system of education in England, these institutions are the means of extending the process to the age of manhood, and maintaining what is previously acquired. Having freauently had occasion to point out our inferiority in education to the United States and other countries, it gives me proportionate satisfaction to claim mechanics' institutions as being essentially English, and a most valuable means of completing the edacation of young men. (Cheers.) I caunot refrain from saying a few words on the system of prizes, which is the especial reson of our assembling to-night. With rega-d to these prizes, as applied to elementaryschools, dlfferences of opinion may exist. I consider them valuable as auxiliaries of a good system, and as palliatives to great evils, but if I am told that they are to be accepted as substitutes for a better system, and that we are to look to them as the panacea for all existing educational deficiencies, I repudiate the idea altogether. fApplause.) But this is not the case with the system adopted in theseinstitutions at a subsequent stage of education. Hlere, In my opinion, the prize system produces unqualified good effects. I hope it will be so regulated as to be open to the most numerous possible body of caudidates, for while it is well to have some prizes for great talent and high attainment, these will generally take care of themselves, and this system, I apprehend, Is rather for the benefit of the many, and ought to be so regulated as not to deter and alarm persons from becoming candidates on account of the great difficulty of obtainiDg prizes. (Cheers.) Mr. G. STmySrIELD sonded the resolution, which w-as carried unanimously, and the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the right rev. chairman.
SADLEmR'b WRLLS THEATBW. The comedy of the Clandestine Macsrije, one of the most ordinary nieces of the English repertory during the days of Mr. Farren and thelate h'irs. Glover, has been so long laid on the shelf that now it is revived at Sadler's WeUs it has all the bloom of novelty uporn it. Mr. Phelps has selected tho character of Lord Ogleby for one of those comic impersonations with which he so often delights his public, and, as usual, his interpretation is altogether originaL That appearance of utter dilapidation which Mr. Barren assumed on his first entrance, as a crazy foundation whereupon the veteran gallant might be hterally built up, is avoided by Mr. _lhelps, who makes the old lord look smart though weakly in his dressing-gown. When he is fairly on his legs, the sense of his proficiency as a conqueror of the feminine heart is expressed not so much by a buoyancy that bursts through all physical impediments, as by a quiet state of chuckling complacency, indicating that le is sure of his victory, and need not put himself greatly outof his way to attain it. Theelaborate compliments, which sound so oddly at the present day, roll from his tongue with all the courtly formality proper to a beau of the obsolete school, and the little touch of sentiment which comes in at the end of the piece elevates the kind-hearted old ralke in the estimation of his audience, so that they take leave of him, pardoning his foibles and admiring his benevolence. Mrs. Marston, decidedly the best actress of the day in the line associated with the late Mrs. Glover, plays the terrible Airs. Hleidelberg with all her force, and the tremendous pormp with whch she basts her familiarity -with the ways of the " quality" creates a roar, though the term and the social condition indicated by its usage belong to a bygone tine. Mr. Ray adequately represents the vulgar-minded Sterling with his ostentatious hospitality and his coarse laugh, and the old Swiss servant Canton, dressed as though he had been snatched from a canvas of Hogarth, is wrought up to the perfection of continental servility by Mr. Williams, an actor who seems to make a " character" of every part he undertakes. That unamiable personage Miss Sterling is deprived of her usual repulsiveness, but allowed full pos.ession of all her acrimony by tho smart pointed acting of Miss Fitzpatrick, and if the engaging Fanny Sterling affords no great scope for the recently discovered talent of Mrs. Cbarles Young, the unaffected manner of the artist keeps the interest of the play in the right direction. The melancholy Lovewell and the gayer-but not very gay-Sir John MelviUe are made as much of as they merit by Messrs. Robinson and Marston, while, to complete the large picture, Miss E. Travers throws a vast amount of downright unyielding force into the emall but effective character of Betty; and Brush, who, like Trip in the S&hool for Sandal, typifies the "Jeames" '.f the last century, is played with burlesque foppery by Mr. Beolford. The costumes are new and appropriate, so that a most agreeable view of the laced coat and powder period is pre. sented to the modern eye.
TO THE EDITOR OF THBE TIE!ES Sir,-Not having observed any cause for the stoppage of the dawks between Lahore aud Mooltan given in the newspapers, I have the pleasure to send you the following extracts fromn a letter dated Mooltan, the 19th of September :- "The peaee of the Mooltan district has within the last few days been disturbed. A band of marauders, headed by the Customs Peons, who mutinied on learning that they were to be dismissed under the provions of a recent order directing the dismissal of all Hindostanees, have attacked and plundered the Hurappa Tuhseel, bordering on this district (and attached to Gogaira), taking off the horses, bullocks. and cameis from some of our post-ofice chowkies, possessed th-mselves of the arms of our rural police, and threatened tne neighbourDg towns and vMlages. The communication with Lahore and other stations has consequently been cut off since the 16th inst.

ExTRAorwnany SUIciDE.-A suicide of a very determined character was committed yesterday on the Bristol and Glocester branch of the MidLandlaUway. Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternuon, during the passage of one of the up goods trains, a woman and her little bay were accosted near the Crossways-bridge by a man with a foreign accent, who asked the way to some place in the neighbourhood. From the peculiarity of his manner and appearance the woman and her boy were induced to watch the stranger, and they observed that after getting a little distance from them he made his way on to the railway embankment, and upon reaching it took his hat from his head and waved it aloft, as if in the act of cheering. They thena saw him descond and go along the line until the whistle of the goods traiu denoted its approach. The man then reascended the embankment and laid his hat upon the ground, after which he descended the slope and concealed himself in a crouching position behind some furze bushes. In this posture he watched the approach of the train, and upon the engine arriving nearly opposite the bushes he threw himself under the wheels, and the whole train passed over him, literally cutting him to pieces. The body is said to have been identified as that of a French doctor named Briot, who left his home on Monday in a desponding state. The engine-driver states that he saw the man on the line about a quarter of a mile above the spot, and that on sounding the signal-whistle and observing that he moved offthe line, he concluded that aU the danger was over. Finding that the engine jerked considerably oa passing the spot where the deceased had concealed himself, the engine-driver stopped the train, and on going back found the mangled remains scattered about the line. The hat was afterwards found at the spot where the woman and bo aw it placed. 0OLYHEJ NEW ATi sSERvicE.-The neyw packets to be provided for the improved mail communication between A'olyhead and Dublin are to be four in number, each being not less than 300 feet long, and of 1,700 tons measurement. The voyages will be four daily-viz., two from each port. and the average time between London and Kingstown will be reduced to 11 hours.

LORD BROUGiHAA IN LIYEBPOOL. LIVERPOOL, Nov. 5. The Right Son. Lord Brougham and Vaux arrived at the Lime-street station yesterday afternoon from Leeds. He was met by Mr. William Brown, M.P., Mr. Joseph Christopher Ewvart, sP., and a number of other gentlemen. His Lordship accompanied Mr. Brown to the resi. deuce of that gentleman, whose guest he Is during his stay in Liverpool. This morning Lord Brougham vsited theFree ibrary and Museum and other public institutions, proceeding shortly before 1 o'olock to the Livarpool Institute and School of Art for the purpose of inaugurating the Queenes College, recently formed in connexion with that scholastic establHshment, between which and the Univeralty of London it now forms the connecting link. The noble lord was acowmpaniied on the platform by Mr. W. Brown, M.P., Mr. Janmes Mllyneux, President of the Lverpool Literary Institute, Mr. George Holt, the Professors of the CoUege, and other gentleren. The tnoble lord was received with loud and reiterated cheering. Mr. BROW2, M.P., read letter; from Lord Stanley (of lHuowsley), the Bishop of Manchester, and other distinguished personages, expressing sympathy with the object of the mneeting, hut pleaing prior eDgagemenits which pro. vented their attendance. Lord BROUGHAM, on taldng the chair, was vehemently applauded. It gives sme very unfeigned pleasure (said the noble lord) to acknowledge to you with heartfelt thanks the greatklndness with which you have received me, and which, I wil add, is not confined to those who are within these walls, but I have muet with the same kindness wherever I have been since my arrlval in LiverpooL We are met here upon a most important occasion-tbe opening of an irstitution which is already in progress of florishing andwhichIdo most devoutly hope, and Iwill add confidently expect, wil flourish more and more every year of its existence. (Cheers.) When I came 22 years ago to lay the foundation-stone of that institution, in immediate connexion with this Queen's Colege-I mean the then-caUed " Mechanics Institution," afterwards the "Liverpool Institute"-I little expected that I should liveto see the day when itshouldbe connectedwith a collegiate establishment, that establishment connected with a university. (Cheers.) Now, were I at the present day to dweU upon the advanitages of knowledge and the inestimable benefits of education I should be doing one of the most useless things that it would be possible for a man to bestow his labour on (hear, hear), as to the benefits of knowledge-and education there is happily, nowadays, nothingwhatevernewtobesaid. (Hear.) Moreover, allpersons admitthe benefits of education-all, or nearly all-and the few who still deny it may be said to be unconvertible. (Laughter and cheers.) Now, it is an old saying that to preach to the converted is a useless office, and I may add that to preach to the unconvertible is a thanldess office. (Cheers.) I carefully, therefore, avoid addressing either class, But upon the inestimable advantage of this new institution saffer me to detain you for a few momeats. Liverpool has been tMll now what the great capital of London itself was till the year 1820 or 1826, whoUy without the benefits of a college establishment for education. There were certain classes In the ca.pital, and also in Liverpool-though, perhaps, fewer in point of numbers-who educated their sons at the University of Oxford or Cambridge, or, in Ireland, at the Trinity Colege, Dabl'n, or in Scotland-but I will say something afterwards on that subject, which stands on another footing. But in London there war not fcr those who could not afford or did not choose to zend their sons to Oxford or Cambridgethere was no means of obtaining good sound educatien in the walks of science, including the science of medicine itself. We then founded a University College, for many years called the Urniversity of London. Since that university has been established, to whichthis college is now affiliated, as well as King's College, the younger slster of the University College-or, rather, I might call it the daughter, for one sprang out of the other-the University College of the metropolis affords the inestimable advantages of a sound education of all descriptions, classical as well as scientific, for those who either cannot or do not choose to send their sons to Oxford and Cambridge. (Cheers.) I said a minute ago that I paused upon what I had to observe respecting the Scotch colleges, for this reason,-that the University College, being chiefly destined to educate the sons of persons residing in the town itself, was placed naturally upon the same footing with the Edinburgh and lasgo w Colleges, and with that of Aberdeen, which educate the sons of persons resident upon the spot, and are, as it were, day schools, conferring the inestimable advantages not only of an economical but also of a moral kind, to those sons who reside under the paternal roof while they frequent classes of knowledge in the course of tbe day. (Hear, hear.) Upon that footing mainly is the London University conducted; but it also gives the -ame advantage to those coming from the country, but who are in very small numbers compared with those who belong to London Itself. All those who come from the country of course live in lodgings and the boarding-houses, as in Edinburgh and Glasgow,-the great bulk living in thei: fathers' houses, with all the advantages in point of morals as well as of mere economy,-but the higher anvantage in point of morals, being under the eye and superintendence of their parents, while they benefit by the instruction of the masters in the course of the day. Now, this is the plan of the Queen's College, to open which we are assembled to-day. It will not refuse to receive those who board or lodge In the town, their parents not living in Liverpool; but the bulk of those who attend it will naturally be the sons of Liverpool parents, and wll enjoy those great advantages to which I have just adverted. That this should be otherwise than eminently successful I hold would be a slander upon the people of Liverpool to entertain the slightest doubt. (Cheers.) Professors well calculated to afford full instruction on all matters of science are already engaged to hold classes, and considering the short time during which it has been open, the college has had considerable success, but a success which I will venture to say will be as nothing compared with what in a very few yearsI will even say months-will attend their very enlightened labours. (Applause.) I have said that, connected with this college, is that institntion which was opened 20 years ago, and of which I had the great honour of laying the foundation-stone. Commencing with a very small beginning, I think, as early as the year 1825, it occupied a roon for evening classes only in Parker-street - some years afterwards it removed to the rooms nov occupied by your Free Library and Museum in Sister-street; and I cannot even in passing name that readingroom and museaum, which I had great pleasure in inspecting this morning, without expressing the gratification which I felt on finding tht of the very noble library of 22,000 volumes-confined to the readingroom, not lent out-500 or 600 daily are in the hands of young men attending that reading-room,-100 at a time being all that the room can accommodate; and that of the other libraries connected with that institution, containing 17,000 volumes for lending out, upwards of 1,200 are issued day by day, of which it is not estimating too highly to say that not less than four readers benefit by every one of those volumes. Let it be observed, and it is a most gratifying circumstance, that when the public lending libraries were established, Instead of diminishing, they g reatly increased the number of readers at the Contral Free .ibrary. (Cheers.) But when I mention that reading. room, that museum, and that library I caunnot pass over another circumstance whlch the presence of my most esteemed and hon. friend Mr. Brown (great cheering) would have suggested had I not been aware of it before, though his presence imposes a restraint on me in expressing my feelingS, which I know are all your feelings, with respect to his noble ane -wise as well as noble munificence. (ApXplause.) 2Now, connected with this mechanics' inst'itute, now called the Liverpool Institute, which numbers, as I understand at this moment upon an average 1,400 members, I rejoice to find that it is self-supporting, So much could not have been predicated of the small beginngs to which I have adverted in Parker-street and in Slater treet before the year 1837, when the new institution was opened, but ever since that-except with respect to a debt of moderate amount now paid off by subscription -the whole of that institution has been supported in all its expenses by the payments of those who benefit by it. (Cheers.) I will not enter into particulars except upon two points; and the one is, that thereare receiving the benefit of instruction in that institution and paying for it somewhere ahout 1,400. the greater of whom, almost the whole, are mechanics, artisans, or persons living by daily and weekly wages. (Hear, hear.) No doubt this Is a great benefit to them, to their employers, and to the town and society of which they are members. But there are also, no doubt, defects to be observed. 1L400 for Liverpool is too small a number, and I confidently hope that if I should be spared to visit Liverpool a year or two hence (loud cheers) I shall find that 1,400 more than doubled. (Renewed cheers.) Having alluded to a girls' school which had been established by rx. G. Holt, his Lordship said,I only wish it were possible that I saw an immediate prospect of another kind of school for the benefitSof persons of a humble rank, to be taught not needlework, or embroidery, or arts of that description-things useful enough in their way,-bat ordinary common things, so as to qualify girls for being domestic servants. (Applause.) At a late congress which I attended at Birmingham we had a most important and a moat painful and heartrending paner read by on>e of the most eminent men of London, Mr. Acten, who clearly showed what frIghtful effects upon the morals of that class of s^ociety are pro. duced by the parents not stooping to let them be taugut ordinary things, so as to malie them fit for being domestic servants, but must needs teach them needlework to starve upon threepenee a day-to struggle for a few months, and, in some heartrending cases, even for a year or two, with that utterly inadequate payment for their own support, and sometimes the support of an infant or a parent, wvho are in the end often driven from mere hunger into profligate courses. (Applause.) Now, if, instead of teaching them those things, they taught them those ordinary matters of cookery, washing, domestic management which would qualify themtobedomesticservantstheywouldobviate that universal compl2ant both in town and country-the difficulty of obtaining domestic servants-and prevent that great source of Immorality of young women in London and elsewbere which MIr. Acton has s9 justly and without he slightest exaggeration described. (Cheers.) I wish to detin you as little as I possibly can, but I feel it my d aty to dweU upon one or two of those partioulars to which I alluded the day before yesterday at Leeds,-namely, the isreportance of early closing (cheers),; and those in. whose l' ends that question may be sa:.d to rest are in the first plrce the employers of young people-shopkeepers, nmanufrjcturers, and another class to which I shall presently advert . Now, asto manufacturers. Far be it indeed from me to i 'sist upon their dismissing their workmen or young sVorkysople after 12 hours rather than 13 hours of employment, or after 14 rather than 15 hours, bmvause they may answer me, " There are two thir .gs of which men are extremely generous; the one is V.aeir own advice, and the other is other people's money ." (Laughter.) And, generaly speaking, that 2s too true -but still 1 ¢annot help feeliDg that it is tae duy of those n;aster manufacturers, as far as they can, to. lessen the r nmber of hours that these poor young people are employee, under them. But I would not have it d6se all at once' but suppose they were employed 15 tours, 'lat migb'%'be reduced to 14 this year, giving thes noticestbat if they did not work harder duriuc, toSe 14 XQi4> it Nvov,d, became 15 hours again the 77ti after. And so in proportion with the other hours;' Were this plan carried out I think the manufacturers wonld nothostain any material lous, and that the problem would be solved. (Alpplause.) Comnigtotheshopkeepers, hisLordshipshowredh ow impossible it was for young people confined in a shop from 7 in the morning until 9 or lo at night either to go to sebool or to do anything else in an educarional point of.view. He argued that the settlement of this part of the questiqn rested quite as much with the customers as with the shopkeepers themselves, and that if the former would oily act rationally and benevolently the change could be effected without loss to the shopkeeper, and with rcaterial benefit to .he~o Ung peoplethemselves. Alludilgnext to the difficulties in Inda in connexion with the subject of education, his Lordship said,- Of the difference between uneducated and barbarous man and educated and civilized man we bave had, unhappily, of late the most frightful example in our Eastern possessions-those whom we ca,l fiends in the dipguise of men, and justly so, from a striking, aye a frightful illustra. hon of the au of force and powver, and the arts of destruction which you have taught them, being in the hands of men who are not educated and humanized by civilization. See what has been the result. See those frightful, those hideous scenes enacted by such men in possession of such force. Frightful indeed to contemplate; almost impossible to allow to pass through one's mind ! Those creatures I the subjects of princes who arrogate to themselves the title to which they have no right-of lions; for one calls himself Runjeet Singh, or the Lion Ranjeet-for that is their Eastern vanity and their Eastern falsehood and fraud, They have no title, and they slander that animal by assuming the name. (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) The rage of the lion is noble compared with theirs. There is another animal whom they might call themselves by the name of-the tiger. (Hear, hear.) The lion only puts to death his victim by his instinct, but the tiger tortures him sand torments him before he releases him by death from the torments that have made his life not to be endured. (Renewed cheers.) Shall all this be passed over even when this mutiny is put down? No. I say " No," and the voice of all the civilized world echoes that negative. (Cheers.) I speak not of revenge, for we are Christans (renewred cheers); but I speak of retribution-dizcriminating retribution. (Cheers.) That all this may end better thau it has begun-worse It could not-that all this evil imay be got rid of, and may lead, I won't say to better governing, but to more wisely and to more discriminatingly administering our affair inthe East, is my sanguine hope and confident expectation; and that it may lead to extending to those classes the benefits of education which they so greatly want, and show that, without the slightest attempt at intolerant interference with their faith, we at least are not ashamed of our ow n (" hear, hear," and applause), and that vwe shall set hem an example at least, if we canmot give them instrucion in relgious duties and in Christian morality. (Cheers.) Having again expressed his best wishes for the prosperity of e institutlon, his Lordship resumed his seat amid loud applause. Mr. G. HOLT proposed,- That this meettg congratalate the public on the aecession to the town of so valuable au institution as the Qnsen'd College, anid heartily wih it eve,vryo-slble encases!' Mr. H. BOOTH seconded the resolution, which was carried by acclamation. On the motion of Air. W. BROWN, M.P., seconded by Mr. J. MOLYNmux, a vote of thanks to Lord Brougham for honounng the occasion with his presence was also carried by acclamation. Lord BROUGrHAI, in responding, said,-You will at once perceive how needless it is for me to express my hearty thanks for your great kindness, but I must say that it mortifies and humbles meto think how very, very much less I have been able even to attempt than I could have wished. As to success, I almost entirely deny that any material success has attended the efforts that I have made, along with others wiser, and better, and abler than myself (" No, no"), in the cause, the great cause of popular education. In some things we have succeeded. We have obtained for the people, as my hon. friend Mr. (Mr. Brown) has well said, we have obtained some material rights for the people. I only hope the people will show their sense of those rights we have endeavoured to bestow upon them by continuing well to exercise them-by choosing good and useful representatives, for example (cheers)-by giving their children such an education as is within their means-and by all ranks, even the humblest; taking advancageof themeansof instruetion whicharenow largely-Iwill saylavishly-providedforthemall over the country (Cheers.) I cannot recollect that I am now standing in Liverpool without expressing my infinite gratification on the very -wholesomo change which I find to have been produced in the diminution of the rancorous spirit of party of those who think in Church and State. (Cheers.) I can hardly fail to remember what Liverpool was 45 years ago. Upon another ground I will venture to express my extreme gratification. Observe, I say nothing against party, if it is honest, if it it is based on principle, if men combine together because they really and honestly entertain certain opinions, and do not advocate them for mere party pur-oses-not as counters with which they play a party game. To such no man can object less than mvself ; but it is against the bad spirit of faction, with all its profligacy and aU its falsehood, all its acrimony and virulence, that I protest, and In the extinction of which here in Liverpool I rejoice. (Applause.) But one word more on a subject on which I and those with whom I have been afellowlabourer 40, 50, or 60 years worked together, and in -which there has been most entire success. I speak in Liver. pool, which was once the seat of the infornal Africau slave trade. (Cheers.) It is to me a matter of unspeakable delight and exultation wbich I cannot suppress within my bosom that I have lived to se not even the shadow of a shade holding by that execrable traffic. (Cheers.) Let us hope that we are not to see it revived under another name. (ChOeers) Let ushope that the planter arty will no longer exercise an infiuence, not merely to be deplored, but to be reprobated, over certain potentates with whom we are in alliance, and of whom I wish to speak with the greatest respect (cheers); but I grieve to find what I predicted in the House of Lords Last July, that in this rid?culous pretext to encourage " the emigration," as it is called, of "' free African labouiers," which is an attempt to revive the African slave trade (hear, hear)-I grieve to say and I am surprised to find that what I then predicted has been more than verified, and that tke innocent, and useful, and civilizing commerce of Africa is for the present suspended by that speculation. I hope and trust that there will speedily he an end to It; but I could not have left without lifting up my voice in Liverpool to denounce that which I call, not an abomination, far from it, but a delusion prevailing elsewhere. (The noble lord ceased amid general cheering, and the proceedings terminated.) At the Free 2ablic Library and Museum Lord Brougham was received by Mr. J. A. Pilcton, who explained to his Lordship the flourishing condition of the institution. The noble Lord appeared highly gratified, and made some wellapplied observations. On leaving the Liverpool Institution Lord Brougham proceeded to the railway station forthe purpose of immediately returning to Brougham-halL.
T1A vELLrNG 1Pd ITALY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On Wednesday, the 21st of October last, I, along with my wife and several other passengers, left Sienna for Rome, having taken two seats in the coup6. We started at about 12 o'olock midday. AUl went on well till about 12 o'clock at night, at which time we arrived at the Roman frontier, the Ponte Centino, where Is the Custom-house. Some time before this a fearful thunderstorm had arisen, accom. panied with perfect deluges of rain. After waiting some time (which arose, I believe, from the unwillingness of the postillons to proceed further) we proceeded onwards. At about half a-mile from the Custom-house we had literally to cross the bed of a hiU stream, as the bridge was broken down-a most serious undertaking in the fmest night, but in this, during one of the most fearful storms that could be Imagined, perfect madness, owing to the torrent of water that was coming down. When within a few yards of the river, after having once been nearly upset, the horses either refused from fear or were unable to proceed from the state of the ground, it being like driving across country. The horses were then taken out and sent back to Ponte Centino, as I supposed, to get some more horses or some oxen. This was about half-past 1 in the morning. About two hours elapsed; the storm all this time had been going on without any intermisdon; the river had swollen to a most alarming extent, and had reached the diligence; and not one word had been heard either of the gnad or the horses. We saw if we stopped much longer in the diligence It would be at the peril of our lives. I told this to a gentle. man in the coupL with me, and he fonnd out from some of the passengers in the interior that an ox-cart had been sent down (I believe by the Custom-house people) to our rescue. I then jumped out into the water, and made my way to the back part of the diligence; I sawv some kind of conveyance had arrived, and got the driver to come with a lantern to help my wife into it. We then proceeded a3 well as we were able to the Cnstom-house, and found when we arrived there that two of the passengers were absent, Not so the guard; he had saved himself, and never came to warn one of us in the coupe, nor those, as they said after, who were in the bamsgeatc. We arrived back again at Ponte Centino about 4, and waited patiently for daylight; when it broke some one came to say, as I expected, that the dili. gence was nowhere to be seen. Too true ;soon after we left it the waters rose, as those who were in the &anquedic said, roand the diligence tiUl it was carried away by the raging torrent. The two gentlemen who were in the b&qucte were brought in aud put to bed some hours after; one, I believe, saved himself by swimming or lying on his back fra the water. Soon after we w ent down toes£eif we could fit'd and secure our lugg>age, and Foud some lying in the neighbeurine fiolds. but the msant valuS arle nai- n1 luggage, containing jewels ani money, was nowheto be found, and I have no doubt it W55 plUY,dered We were forwarded to Eome in somo sort of things called carriages, but did not atnve till nearly a day and a half after our time, having nothing with us to wenr except whatwehad on. Wher, we arm-,ed at the ofice the director never of ed us a carriage to go to an hotel, nor one halfpenny to> buy any necessa.ies * nor have we to this day heard naything of the ,',a,ble property, almounting to some hund-eds of toullds, 'belonging to us alone.

I THE DUK'E OF ZNEWOASETLB ON INDIAN AFFAMRS, The Duke of Newcastle performed the ceren-lonygf laying the corner-stone of the new National Sehoqls, now in course of erection at East Retford, on Tuegda3r l,ast and in the eveniug attended a meeting of the Soiatt for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. .Eis Grace delivered a speech in favour of the objects of the society, and, aater reviewing the course of its ope.S tions in various parts of the world, sad, their most exoevt. lent diocesan was about to addyoss them upon theoperationof the society among the heMthens. He feared to engroachL upon that province at all, and yet there was one part which appeared to belong to the subject allotted to him-he referred to the church in India. He was aware that it might be felt that the time had hardly come when anyone ould enter fully-he might say with freedom on the subject of the church in India, because, in the first place, all the energies of this great empire must, for the present, be devoted to one !object; they mnst endearour to put down the rebellbous murderer in that land-they must endeavour as speedily a possible to establish British rule in that great country. The arm of power must be exertbd for that purpose, not merely an account of the preige of this great empire, not merely for any advantages which may be supposed to accrue from its position, but, as the Bishop of Oxford lately said at a similar meeting in the town of Liverpool, "As Christiar. men we are not justified in abandoning India ;" 120,OO0,00O had claims upon us; and he believed we should be guilty, not only of treason to the State, but of treason to our religion and our faith if we were to abandon that continent to the atrocities of any government or any people who might, for anylittle time at least, succeedusinthatempire He believed, in facb he knew, that the greatest ignorance of India prevailed throughout English society, and those who knew the most felt they knew the least, asd therefore were not prepared to dogmati7e. At the same tume he for one would not be found to blame those against whom culpability might be said to lie though sightly, if at all, as he was little disposeA to maike accusations which time might prove could not be substantiated, or fall into the common habit of stigmatizing the Government for a gross dereliction of duty with regard to the propagation of Christianity in India. He spoke, when he said so, of the present moment, because he was prepared to maintain that great timidity and vacillation were shown on this subject. Re was prepared t- admit, nay, to assert, that while onthe one hand missionary officers were tolerated as a kind of service which he for one, either in his place in Parliament or in any other assembly, would enually and at any time be prepared most strongly to repudiate, yet, on the other hand, the privilege of missionaries of the church to reside in Hindostan waS not given. Perbaps they would say great blame was attached to the Government for so doing; but he was not prepared to say to what extent the conduct of the Government was improper. He did not merely refer to those facts which were patent to all, and to the improvements which had been introduced within the last few years in the habits and customs of the people by local government, but he took many instances as evincing the falsity of the statement that Obristianity had been absolutely repudiated by the Government. He spoke. of course, of late years; aud, not wishing to trespaws upon their time, he would only refer to one sentence in a letter written by the Rev. Dr. King, Principal of the college at Calcutta, after the dreadful massacre at Delhi. He said intelUgent and well-informed native converts held high and important positions-the highest of the mission. Now, he contended that those few words clearly proved that the converts by the missionaries of this society had not been subjected to the pains and penalties spoken of. His object in referring to this was not to dtfend the Government-that was no business of his; but he was bound in fairness to mention it, and from the information which he at present possessed he could not join in those strong terms of reprobation which had been. launched agaimst them by many who had spoken and written on this subject. The most opposite opinions appeared to be, held as to what we should do when the strong arm of power had been established in India. To judge from what they heard, some people would overcome all difficulties by being "all things to all men." That appeared to be the vievr vhich some people took of tbis matter, while otbers advocated a policy of a totaUy different character, which they hardly avowed though vainly hoped-he would not caU it a propafation by sword and cannon, but a compulsory propagation o their creed. Now, as regarded the first of these matters they had certainly little temptation to attempt anything of the kind. How had measures of that kind succeeded already? How hadtoogreat a deference tothereligious feelings of the people been met ? Why, in this way,-the greased cartridges had been seized upon as a pretext for rebellion, because, they said, we had been endeavouring to. tamper with their faith-we had been establishing , dynasty opposed to theirs-the Mahomedan-by fire and sword. Well, then, that failed, or at all events systems similar to it. As zegarded comnulsory conversion, he could hardiy think that any man could maintain that this principle wasnotalien tothe habits of the people of England and utterly alien to the genius of Christianity. We could not, with our enlightenment, adopt the theories of the Talmud, nor, as Christians, imitate the fallacies of Mahomet. So, we were not by compulsion of every kind to force these men into a false Christianity, whom we were not able by conviction. to bring to our faith. He said that Government power must. neither be used to control nor disturb the religion of the natives. Complete toleration must be given. When he said toleration, he meaut not only must compulsion of every kind be avoided, but that which was as bad, namely, seduction-which he could only call a broad species of fraud-must be equaUy avoided. They must neither attempt by compulsion nor by reward tomake Christians of men whom they could not convince. He believed the latter was as alien to. the spirit of Christianity as the former. Any man who came to be so convinced was little better than a believer in the faith he had just left. But if they were not to do this they might at any rate avow their faith and act in accordance with it. They might show their Christian conduct and they might adopt P. Christian policy. They might show in private life those virtues and characteristics which would induce the natives to follow the belief of those whom they could not help admiring and respecting. Surely, it would besno difficult matter for the natives to draw a contrast between the Christian lives and policy of those wvho now govern them, as compared with the monstrous lies and wickedness, the treacbery and horrors perpetrated before their eyes by those who ruled them in former days. It was by such examples as these-by such conduct as that -the spread of Christlanity would be effected in that great continent of India. (Cheers.) He repeated that Government must not attempt to convert. The power of Government must not be exercised for that purpose. Policy, faith and duty forbade it. But that was not the case as regarded individuals. As regarded individuals, the Government was not only justified but bound to give them fair play. It was through the agency of men whom thia society eent out that this great work must be carried on. He confessed to have seen, with some pain, allusions made in various quarters to vhat people were pleased to ca the judgments of Providence upon us for our sins in India. He could not help feeling that there was something almost profane in putting these minute interpretations on the ways of the Almighty, that time, circumstauce, and place were all to be fixed by our fallble eyes as to the objects of the Almiihty and the sins for which He was especially afficting us. lBo doubt, all suffering was the consequ ence of sin, but were they justified in saying that it was or some act which was committed 30 years ago, by which some slight had been placed on the Ch'nstian religion in Iudia, that Providence had visited us with this great caLamity. We had sins enough in this country, in India, and ebewwhere to call for the Tisitation of the Almighty without pretending to judge the exact cause of the calamity which had befallen us. It was enough for us to see the finger of God in the work, and, seeing it, to believe that it might conduce by God's; blessing to the propagation of the faith of Christ in India. (Cheers.) They had often seen that these calamities, towhich fallible men could attach none but the most disastrous consequences, had been the harbinger of a better day ; they had seen many of the greatest calamities turned into the greatest blessings; and he ventured to hope that this calamity, great as it was, would be succeeded by that result. After some further observations the noble duke resumea his seat amid loud cheers.

FORBIGN IXTELLIGBNpE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN COssPB rv, % t'Tho following appeared In our seoond odition ol yes. tra :-_I PARIS, WDN,-SDAY, NMoV. 4, 6 P.. The accord supposed to exist between Prussia and Austria on the question of the Danubian Principalities is not denied or admitted at the Ministerial offices. You are merely told, " We have no information on the matter." This, of course, no one believes, or the French Minister at Berlin must be a very useless sort of person. So unsatisfactory an answer naturally leads people to conclude that these two Powers are of one mind, and, as Russia is evasive, France seriously apprehends that,if she persists in supporting the political union se will be left alone in the Congress; and all the ensusiam of her agents and the homilies of the P107niteur and the other organs of the Foreign-office on the purlty of election will go for nothing. The party against whom the Emperor feels most indignation is the Sultan, and I doubt much, after what hab occurred, whether His Majesty holds an opinion as to the vitality of the Ottoran Empire very different from that of the late Emperor of Russia. The E-mperor is dissatisfied with the turn things take in thePrincipalities, where certain words are pronounced which have an awkward revolutionary sound, and are grating to an Imperial ear. The Moldo-Wallachians have gone beyond the limits the French Government assigned to them, and the indiscreet zeal of the Mnisterial press has made matters worse. The parties who, in truth, are the first sufferers by this state of things are the Turkish and Austrian Ambassadors in Paris; they are as yet excluded froma the festivities of Compiegne. Fancy these unhappy gentlemen condemned to read every morning lively descriptions of thehunting and the huntsMen; about the noble "quarries" which, I suppose, wait to have the honour of being shot at by His Majesty; the magnificent banquets and the more magnificent guests who partake of them-all these fine things going on, and they not sharing them ! The neglected diDlomatists were, it appears, in the firat list to be invited, when the remorseless Lord Stratford dashed from their lips the cup before It was tasted. AL Hubner is, it is said, about to proceed to Vienna " on leave of absence." Vienna is near at hand, but whither shall Mehemed Djemil Bey fly to avoid the sight of pleasure he cannot enjoy? Constantinople is far off, and the Ottoman Tantalus must bear hPI pain to the last. It has been announced by telegraph that King Otho has subscribed 10,000f. out of his privy purse to the Indian Relief Fund, and directed the various fuDctionaries to follow his example. The following is t"e text of the Royal decree issued on the occason:- "The unheard-of misfortunes whioh havelatelyfalen upon the Christians of British India having come to our knowledge, and observing also the general sympathy which these misfortunes have produced among the inhabitant, of this kingdom, who are moved not only by a spirit of philanthropy and Christian charity, but also by that feeling of profound gratitude which they entertain towards England for the aoble aid she gave them during the war of Independence, we, at the proposition of our Minister of the Interior, have decided that the Nomarchs be ordered to open subscription lste throughout the country in favour of the victims of this barbarous mutiny, and, alter having collected the amount, they will forward the sum to the office of the Home Department. Our linister of the Interior is charged with the execution and the publication of the present ordinance. " OTHO." A subscription has been oDened at Turin for the sufferers by the mutiny, to which King Victor Emmanuel has contributed 10,000f. The publication of the reply of Queen Maria Christina to the report of the Parliamentary Commission of 1854 is expected with much curiosity in Madrid, and will, it is said, produce a favourable Impression. The moment is well chosen as M. Mon is most anxious for her return to Spain, to protect him against the cabals of the Court. Though the Cabinet Is hardly instaUed in office, the rumous of a Ministerial crisis were current in Madrid on the 31st. They are, as I learn from a private letter of that date, entirely unfounded. The incident which gave rise to them was this:-On the previous day, that is, the 30th, Admiral Armero submitted to Her Majesty the nomination of two functionaries, or, to speak more properly, he consulted her on the subject. He proposed to appoint as Captain-General of Seville General Rlvero, the present DirectorGeneral of Infantry, and General Aleson as hiB successor. The Queen objected to Aleson, on the ground of his being a Progresista, and Armero did not insist. Now as Martinez de la Rosa and Casans, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the latter of Justice, bad informed their colleagues that they accepted office merely to facilitate the formation of the Cabinet, and should resign on the slightest manifestation of dissension between the Queen and the Mlinisters, the fact of these two Generals having been proposed to the Queen, and Her Majesty's refusal to confirm their appointment, was concealed from both Ministers. Hence the rumours of a crisis. Another incident also gave some appearance of probability to the report. Armero went to the Palace on the 30th, to have an audience of the Queen. He was kept waiting for some time; Armero became impatient, particularly when he saw the Chamberlain introduce the Intendant of the Palace before himself. Hegrew angry, and left the Palace without seeing Her Majesty. The " Sepoys," as the Vicalvarists are caUed at Court, have become very restless since the fall of Narvaez. Gonzales Bravo is expected to arrive here soon. He gives up his post, as he anticipates that it will be taken from him. It would be sarprising indeed if Mon retained such an ambassador at such a Court as that of England. He comes to lend a hand to Narvaez to overthrow the Cabinet. There is nothing new in the political world. The Ministers are verybusy distributing the best places to their friends; afterwards they will probably attend to affairs of State. The coumtry can afford to wait. The press Is rather favourable than otherwise. The general hatred against Nocedal, the late Ministera hatred not confined to any party, but to all alikecauses the present Ministers, even if they were bad, to be regarded with favour. Nocedal knows weU how his name and person are execrated; he keeps himself out of public sight to avoid any matifesbtation of public feeling, and for fear of the indignation of the unfortunate people whom he Imprisoned at Leganes (a village about nine miles from Madrid), which he had transformed into a kind of penal settlement. 2,000 persons were confined there, whose only crime, that we are aware of, was having belonged to the national militia of Madrid under the Government of Espartero. They have been set at liberty by the spontaneous act of Bermudez de Castro, the present Mfinister of the Interior. The Three per Cents closed to-day at 67f.

The Itdperdanwe says - " It appears that the dlecision adopted by the members of the Cabinet to resign their portfolios did not at first obtain the unanimous assent of the members. If our information be correct, and we have every reason to believe it is so, three diferent opinions were expressed in the Cabinet. Viscount Vilain XIV. and M. Dedecker are stated to have energetically deolared their intention to resign; MUs. Dumon and Greindl said they wero disposed to adopt the opinion or the majority, whatever it might be; and MM.I* Nothomb and Mercier declared that they would remain at their posts in spite of public dispproTal. However, notwithstanding the tenacity of the last two gentlemen, the opinion of Visount Vilaln XIV. and M. Dedecker wsy, in the end, as is known, adopted." M. de Brouckeme, who was fizst sent for by the King of the Belgians in order to form a Ministry, wais one of the member of the National Congress in 1830, is a moderate deputy of the Left, and was formerly the chief of the Cabinet replaced by that now dirtd by M. Dedewker. A letter from Bruslels, in speakingof the redgnatioFn, says " The disolution of the Chamber is considered by many political men as exceedingly probable, particularly if M. de Brouokire asumes the reius of power. It is said that if the dissolution takes place the Right wil abstain from coming forward as candidates. The King is greatly annoyed at the present state of affairs, amd wil, report says, do all in his power to preveot suoh a course of prooeeding. The chiefs of the Left hold meetings every day, either at the residence of General Goblet, member of the Chamber, or of HL. Rogier, head of the Liberal Ministry of 1846." The latest accounts from Brussels state that M. de Brouckere has not succeeded in formxing a Ministry. It wras supposed that some other member of the LXeft would be sent for. The review of the Civic Guard of Brussels, which was to have been held on Tuesday next, on the opening of the Chambers, has been countermanded. It is therefore presumed that there wiMl not be a Royal speech on the occasion. PRUSSIA. (ROMS Oun OWN CORRESPONDENT.) BERLIN, Nov. 3. The course of the King's recovery continues uninterrupted, but does not progress any more rapidly than I have been able to annoulce hitherto. His Majesty still walks every day on the terrace of Sans Souci, leaning on the arm of the Queen, but they do not even yet extend to more than half an hour, and various attempts that have been made show that, how satisfactory soever his improvement In bodily health is, he has as yet made very little progress towards a capacity for entertaining subjects of Importance involving thought and reflection. The delay in removing to Charlottenburg has not been occasioned by any relapse or diminution of strength on his part, but by the necessity of preparing the roads thither for the easy travelling of his carriage. Since the opening of the railroad from Berlin to Potadam, some 20 years back, the cross-country roads from Charlottenburg and Berlin to Potsdam have falen very much out of repair, almost the sole traffic thereon being confined, at present, to marketgardeners' carts; and so, now that even the smooth travelling of the railway carriage Is thought by the physicians too much for their Royal patient to bear, the state of the sad cross. roads shows it,elf as one more than ever in need of improvement. The existenoe of a necessity to take these various measures of precaution testifies very distinctly to the nature of the affection under which His Majesty Is labouring, and controverts entirely the determined denials of all those who stand betweeni the Court and the public and strive to keep the latter in the dark on the subject. The Prince of Prussia oontinues to come into town regularly every morning for the despatch of business, generally accompanied by Prince Frederick William; and every morning as the clock strikes 11 his Royal Highness Is found ready to receive the Ministers and the different CaNwnetsrfthe. Hvow valuable this punctuality and attention to business must be to the different members of the Government at the present juncture maybe measured from the faot, that of Cabinets-ordres alone, which in matters of routine are short documents involving only the necessity of signature, there were 1,800 waiting to be despatched when the Prince undertook the management of public affairs. Yesterday his Royal Highness gave audience to the young Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who, together with the Marquis Lavradio, the Portuguese Minister in London, has come here for the purpose of obtaining the consent of the King, as head of the house of Hohenzollern, to the marriage of the Princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern with the young King of Portugal. Among the few diplomatio personages whom his Royal Highness has as yet given audience to have been the new representative of the Sublime Porte at this Court, Ishan Boy, who presented his credentials, and Baron von Koller, the Austrian Minister. The new Prussian Minister at the Court of Vienna in the place of Count Arnim, who has retired from the service on account of ill health,will probably be Baron von Brockhausen, up to the present time Minister at Brussels. The tate of the King of Sweden's health is described In terms pretty nearly applicable to that of the King of Prussia: though it has not retrograded at all, its improvement is but Flow, and the expectation of an entire restoration is very faint indeed. Since his return from Tullgarn the King rides out nearly every day with the Queen in an open carriage. Count von Platen, formerly Minister of Marine in Sweden, has been nominated Swedish Envoy Extraordinary to our Court, and M. C. A. Jarta, hitherto Swedish Chargd d'Affairet in Binseels, to the post of Miniter-Resident at the Court of St. James's.
SAVINGS-BAN S.-Af amcount was given some time ago of the operations of the savings-bank of Paris ia 1856, and the Moniteur contains a report to the Emperor from the Minister of A.griculture and Commerce on the operations of those of all iranoe during the same year. The following are the prinolpal features of the report:-The number of savings-banks authorized at the end of 1856 was 386, being the same number as at the end of the preceding year; but only 373 of them were in operation, and that number was five more than in 1856. The 386 banks had 163 branches. Of the 373 banks in operation accounts have only been obtained from 370 of them. These aocounts show that the capital, subscriptions, donations, legacies, subventions, interest on capital, and various profitsof the 370banks amounted to 9.140,109f., which excee ed the total of 1855 by 697,002f. The expenses of the management of the banks were 1,178,900!., or 30,861f. more than in 1855. The number of savings-banks' books on the Ist of January, 1856, was 890,536; that of those issued in the course of the year was 172,998, and that of those received by transfer 10,685; total, 1,074,219. Of that total the accounts of 138,031 of them were closed in the course of the year, the holders having been paid off; so that there remained on the 31st of December last 936,188, which were 42,322, or about 4-75 per cent. more than at the end of the preceding year. The number of new books isued in the course of the year was 18,797 more than in 1855, aad that of accounts closed 4,093 more. These figures are stated to be highly satisfactory. Divided amon the tota population of France (35,781,628 souls), the 936,188 books show that there was one book for about 38 inhabitants; in 1855 it wwa one in 40. Ln 23 departments the proportion was hlgher, in 63 lower. The departments in which the number of books was highest were the Sine-t-Marne, where it was one in 14, and the Rhone, where it was one in 15 ; those in which it was lowest were La Vendso and Ariage, where It was onein adone in 47& In money the 370 banks had in d from the preceding year 271,359, 16f ifthey received ' n deposits 126,959,5f for interet allowe to depositors 9,442,602f., and fordividends on rente 188,o46f. ; their total receipts were consequently 407,948,566f. Of that sum they employed 382731f. in purchasing rente to reduce aoconts to the limit fixed by the law of the 30th June, 1851, 5,268f. in purchasing rente to oonsolidate abandoned accounts in execution of the law of the 7th of May, 1853, and 10,3.12,343f. in purchasing rente at the demand of the depositors ; they, mroe,ribre eoist the amount of 121,895,31 21.These vriouItes makeia total of 132,605,654f., whiob, deducwe from the aforesaid 407,948,566f., left a balance in hand on the 3Lst of Decem. ber last of 275,342,912t. The deposits made were 6,793,9e9f. more than in 1855, which were atthe rate of 5-65 per cent and the reimbursements ffected 2,271,160f. more, about 1*89 per oent. The balance iu hand was abeut 4,000,0O0f more tdan at the close of the year 1855. Dividing th sums in hand at the end of 1856 among the books held there was an average of 294f. due on eaoh book. In 64 departments this average was exceedoed in 22 it wa not attained. The departments in which it was highest were the Var, whereitwas 5031., and the Vauclase, where ib was 494f.; these in which it were lowest were the Seine, where it was 207f., and the Vosges, where It wa 1901. Seeoting some of the large towns it appe that the der sits made inParis in the course of the year were 26,858.955t Lyons, 3,30,330.; Marseilles, 3,120,552f.; Bordeaux, 2,449,5591.; LDle, 1,397,357f. ; uoen, 1,284,7861. ; Nantes, 991,090f.; and Havre, 981,049f. In all these towns the deposits were considerably greater than those of preceding years. Of the936,188 books 71L,199representeddeposits below 500f., 112,470 deposits of from 501f. to 800f., 68,738 of from 801f. to 1,000!., 39,947 of upwards of 1,000f., but subjeoct to reduotion within threo months, and 3,834 of upwards of 1,000f. not subject to reduction. Compared with the preceding year the deposits below 500f. present an increase of about 5*55 per cent., of from 501f. to 800f. of about 6 37 per cent., of from 801f. to 1, 000f. of about 1-96 per cent., of upwards of 1,000f. subject to reduction 7'35 per cent., and of upwards of 1,000f. not subject to reduction a diminution of about 60 per cent. ThIs decline is ascribed to the numerous deaths of soldiers snd sailors which took place in the Crimea, to the reduction inthe effective of the army, and to the new system of obtainn exemption forminltay service.

TEE BL$HOP OF OXFOBTYS TRIB-N11AL 7ISIT.ATION~. The Bishop of Oxford commenced his trfaienil v3sitatioa of the dioceas of Oxford on Wedn.adas The Right Rev. PR1EA.TE delivered charge to the Ole r.,ie sald,-I meet you again, my rev. brethren aud my orethren of the lity, at this our acoustomed gathering. after another perlod of three years, with pleasurable bat also mingled feelings. That past period oftime down which we have floated together seems to render up again severat eventful imessaes, And the hom ald fears, the successe i and disappointments, and the grefs and joys, by wMhchit was checkered as it pased. Ilve now again in that musing retrospect. The emotions which such a survey must excite are, I suppose, common to us all ;-hunmldiation for time lost, for opportunities not duly used, and now passed irrevocably away,-resolutions made in the strength of God, that in the time to come we will render a truer and more complete service to our crucified and risen Lord, and gratitude to Him whose long-suffering love has so long spared us, and still continues to us the opportunities of service and the gifts of grace. These I think, m their united actlon, gather themselves up around into a solemn and im passloned tuning with our every faculty to our Lord as our helper and our portion. Theme, I thinl, must fill at such a time the souls of all of us. In my own case one other master feeling is present, andmust find utterance. It isone of deep thankfulness to you with whom the providence of God has connected me in the rule and governmuent o' His church for unnumbered acts of kindness. As I look around and see this gathering of laymen and clergy from centre to centre of the diocese I am moved to wonder and doubt whether other dioceses can yield to their bishops such a body of Idnd and personal friends, and warm, hearty, and able coadjutors, as God's goodness has granted to me. The three past years have added new instances to such sup port as I had before received, and have bound me by new ties of friendship to those who in the work of the ministry have been my helpers in the rule of thil diocess-my advisers and supportrs, and who, when it pleased God to visit me wth a heavy family affliction. helped to hold up the lagging spirit which deep grief had beaten down by their loving sympathy and earnest intercessions. Truly, I would ta e up among you this day the Psalmist's song as best expressing my own mind, and say with him, " How good and joyful a thing it Is for brethren to dweU together in unity." I proceed to pss briefly in review before you, first, the chief features of our common working in our own dioceos through these three years For ray own part, in these works would to God it had beea better wrought I I have In those three years ordained 133 candidates to the order of priests, 153 to that of deacons, and I thinlk that I may venture unhesitatingly to say that I and those who have assisted me in the appointed eraminations of those candidates have thankfully notioed in them a marked Improvement, both as to the average amount of preparation for the ministry, andyet as tothemore important quhification-I mean the spirit of serious devotion In Which those peculiar functions have been sought by them. In the same time I have confirmed in this diocess 16,586 candidates, being an increase in the number of 2529 upon the preceding period of three years. In most of our parishes the greatly increased exertions of the clergy through theee and immediately pre. ceding years having already brought to that holy rite the elder members of their flocks who were yet unconfirmed, we may set down thizs increase of nunmbers as really drawa from those who are coming into life, and not from the heavy arrears caused by former negligence. The bearing, the demeanour, of those whom you have brought before me for confirmation has borne undoubtedly most gratfying evidence of greater seriousness and understanding of the rite with which your candidates have come before me to the confirmation. Let mae take this fresh opportunity of encouraging your hearts in this eminently important portion of your labouts. Though only the last great dav cau fuly reveal the greatt effect of confirmation of candidates who have been prepared by wise and lind pastors with dogmatic teaching, with clear and powerful instruction as to Christian iving, with appeals to the consciences, with earnest enforcing upon them the necosaity of spiritual discipline, aud, above all, the earnest prayers and endeavours to draw them one by one to their crucified Saviour, and, under the con. vesting in'duence of His croas, and His love, and His grace, yet we are suffered through God's goodnem to see some of these fruits. The heart of some pastor who is ready to faint under an apparent want of success may be encouraged by such an instance as has come before me. A Crimean chaplain attending the dying inmates of the army hospital after a battle found one, and but one, man at that time whose soul was manifestly filled with the love of Chrlst. As he came to speak to the dying man he found that he traced all his religious life to the labours and grace of confirmation among ourselves in this very diocess. As to this holy ordinance, my rev. brethren, I feel confident that the promise is fulfilled,-" Cast thy bread upon the waters, and It shall be seen after many days." In this work you, my lay brethren, may give us great help b usng the influenoe you possess as parents and as God parents t stir the younger people to seek God's blessing in this ordinance. You may bring them to you, and by coming with them to this celebration to witness their solemn profession of Christ's faith, you may seek for them the outpouring of His Spirit, and may increase the blessings they may receive. For myself, I grudge no labour to give the fullest effect to this ordinance. I have devoted the season of Lent in going round annually each of the three counties in my diocess, and I purpose, God helping me, to continue this practice. From the interlapping of our counties I am enabled to visit any of our neighbouring clergy for urgent cases of those whom they may wish to brmg to confirmation without waiting for my circuit in their own county, Bequests of such kind I am always glad to receive ; and besides this, I am ready to arrange to come annually or biennialy to any parish in this diocess, the olergywishing it giving me due notice for the need of such service. My circuits for the administration have led me to confirm in the last three ears in 200 churches, and I have been able to preach and jog with you in your ministrations and service in 89 churches on other occasions, so that I have ministered to you in the last three years in almost 300 of our churches, and in some of them frequently. In these united services and especially the celebration and partaking of the blessed Saorament of the body and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, I have ever found the liveliest pleasure. As years pass oa this union in worship proves, as I rejoice to believe between us a full, a loving, and trusting unity which nothing else can equally engender or maintain. I trust that during the next three years, if it please God to spare my life, these 289 services in our common parishes may b X yet further multiplied. In another and welcome department of my work your zeal and energy have not suffered. Again, you have called me to reopen 26 restored and to seapart 12 new or rebuilt churches for God's glory and ths good of the souls of EHis people. And now, turni from my own special charge, I have again to thank the rural dean s and other officers of the diocess for the continuation of their unfeigned, their best, their able, and energetic labours in the cause of Christ among us. Again, I feel bound ia justice to them to declare that I know not how with out their aid I could with anything like efficiency ad minister the diocess. The rural chaptersare reported to me more and more by theirexperience to have greater effect ia bringing the olergy of districts into harmony of feeling ano action, which tend, I am convinced, greatly to our growth in grace and to increase incalculably our strength for good I trust after the experience of so much good that these chapters may be begun without further delay in other deaneries 'where they are not already introduced At the last annual meeting of the school inspectors ageneralImprovement was reported to me, and an increase in the number of schools which had comeunder inspection. I kow no instauc3 of managers of schools having admitted inuspectors without their afterwards acknowledging the good effect of their visits; and I would take this opportunity of recommending generaUy to those who have not as yet done so the wisdomn of taking for their echools the advantages which they might secure from those visits. It is by making our schools better that the great part of our work with the population must be done, for not only is this our means of raising the nexr generation as a body, but it is also one of the chiefest instrumonts of awaking the hearts and reaching the affec tions of the adult members of our flocks We can d's nothing effectual for them unless we possess their love, and that love is most directly obtained through the hearts of their children; and to do this we must improve oar wchools, for one main hindrance to our work of ednCating, espeoially, the agricultural poor is the early age at which the children leave us. Now, when their leavingashool is bod, fide the oonsequence of their having reached the age at which they can at once enter upon the true labour of their lives, and learn what will afterwards make them bettor workmen, I do not think we ou htto regret their ohanu g the class-room for the farmyard, ths stable, or the field. In truth, when that season is reached, it is in this rather than in schools their true education is t; be carried on. But what we most lament is that for trifling and doubtful present earnings obtained from ocoupations which do not fit the children for the work of their after life, for the present wants of thoughtless parents, the greoa work of their children's education is so often prematurely interrupted among us. There can be no great improvement here until we have so raised the character of the educatioa we give them, as well as our mode of imparting it, that we at once win in its progress the affections of the children and make their parents feel that by it a real and substantil' benefit is conferred upon them. We have, thank God, an increase in the number of schools which are of this high charter, but much remains to be done before we can hop, that it haa beon reached by the great majority. No labour is better spent than that which brings the religious tralaing and loving instruotion in the distinctive dootrlnes of oar Reformed -Church home to th3ehearts and lives of the young. The principles, affections, habits, and beliefs of the true Church of England men grow in such cases, through GFod's blessing, in the natural growth, and strengthen with the strength, of our population. 'Your returns show 33,938 children as under youtr dally instruction, besides 9,079 in infant sohools, and many more in our Sunday and night schools. This number, large as it is, from the incompleteness of the return, is far less than the actual total. But, muchaswe are doing in these schooL, there is another but not less important class for which we ae pro. viding far less than we ought. While through the system we have been reviewing provision is made for our labouring population, and whils through our great public schools,with theirdependencies of smaller schools and private tuition, and stil more directly through such institutions as St. Peter's College, Radley, and St. Andrew's, at Bradfield, the church does provide Christan education for the higher classes, she dolesa yet scarcely anything for the great middle class of our people; ancdl there is nothing that I would press more earnestly upon the diocess thau that we should resolve to found colleges and institutions which would secutre the oonfidence of our yeomen and leading tradespeople, and offer them the opporbunity of securing for their chlidren a thoroughly good and sound and usdul education in direct connexion with our church. We ought to be encoura6ed to make such attempts by the support our diocesan school at Cowley has received. I shall rejoice to join with you in praotically eonsddering the beet means for providing this moet important 'work. From oar provcios for the training of the young Iturn naturally to what we are doing among the busy masse bof our adult population. The returns whiah I have received from many of you are, for various teasons, inoemplete. They state that the ordinary congregations amount bo 113,779, and 29,38.5 cosmuanicants, Accuracy as to threle reXturs for the future is, for many reasons, so Important that I do not heditato to ask you, my reverend brethren, to take the needful stepsand they really are not difficult-for counting from time to time the actual numbers of our congregations, children and aoults, and to keep an accurate list of your communicantsand their names and attendances. No less than 236 such lists are alreadykept in the diooess. These returns with their numbers abolutely so large, yet relatively to our whole population so small, leading us, if they are correct to the concln. sdon that only one in 20 of our whole popuiation regularly communicate in our churches, suggest to us, I think, two most important questions. And, first, how can we bring under the influence of these means of grace which we ad. minister more of those who are as yet in our reach; and, seoondly, how can we, my reverend brethren, specially make more full proof of our ministry among those to whom it does actuatly reach. Now, of course, the chiefest of all means which we can use for both of these purposes is the raising of our own spiritual life. It must be found in out winning more faith and a more abundant in-dwelling of His Holy Spirit in our own souls-in a more true and earnest love for Christ and love for our brethren being employed in our own hearts-in more simple faith in Him-more devotedness to His sacrifice-more self-denial, more study of God's word, more prayer, more labour, more unity, more doctrines. These, under the blessing of God, will win over to us those who are witheut, and build up those who are within. To causes which may be thus removed many of your answers as to the success of your ministry have drawn my thoughts; for you have named among your ovwn shortcomings, cowardice, neglect of principles, want of prepara. tioss, too much generalities, insu'icient study of God's word, restraint of prayer, and want ef the outpouring of His Spirit. Plainly, then, must our owrn growth in the graces I have mentioned be cur first means of increasing the success of our mini8try-means how easy to name, how difficult, alas through our natural corruption, rightly and habitually to employ. Maythe ontpouring of the good spirit of our God work oa usand in us for this desirableattainnment. Butboyondthese general principles there are one or two special suggestions I would wish you to consider. First, might not an increase of our publio catechizing be found to be beneficial ? I find at present there are 173 churches where this means Is used. If it were not a mere formal asking of set questions and rereating of fixed answers-necessarily a rrformance of very lttle interest to the listeners-but if the children being well prepared by private teaching and questioning, it were the means of drawing out from their mouths not only the great truths of the Gospel, but also the distinctive teaching and authority of our own Church, and all these interspersed with short and affectionate appeals addressed to the hearts and consciences of the people, might not the increase of such a catchetical examination tend'greatly to the instruction and edification of all ? Again, suffer me to ask-and I ask it of myself just as much as of you-are our sermons what they ought to be, and what labour and prayer might make them ? Now, I am by no means disposed to give an indiscriminate assent to the truth of the popularoutory againstour sermons which has of late reached the ears of IL But, set, are they not too often deficient precisely in those qualities which are necessary to make them really effective with our people? For is there not in general the taste of essays or iquitions about them, and their merit soundness moderation, perhaps exactness? And Is not their fault that reallyunpardonablefault to the listeners of every cla, and especially to our clas of listeners-that of dulness ? And is not what we want to reach our people a style of composition the exact opposite of this, one which is intellectual, terse, pointed, dealing in short sentences ; using Saxon words as close to every day life as It can be without being profane or vulgar; being at once impresSive in its subjects, its applications, it ustra'ions, and Its assertions ? Should it not be rough enough, so to speak, to make it felt through their dull skin of ignorance and in. attention? Should it not startle the careless and positively jog the drowsy man ere his slumber is sound ? Should It not be pathetic, for who more notices than our osmmon race that which reaches them through the affections ? Should it not through illustrations convey truths which the unlearned never receive ? Should it not avoid the easy uniformity of a man applying a nostrum, and with the livlng earnestness of one who believes he has all important truths to oonvey declare the curse of sin and the blessed remedy provided for it in the sacrifices and perpetual offering of our Lord, and in the working of God the Holy Ghost ? Should you not dweU on and proclaim Christ on His cross, Christ in His work of love, Christ in Hi word, Christ in His Churob, Christ in His sacraments, and Chrlist crucified; Christ risen, Christ mediating, Christ saving ? Should It not embrace all the variety and fire and love which belongs not to a mouth full of phrases, but a heart and mind and soul fuU of their subject, and that subject eternal life, man lost or man's salvation, and the love of Christ and the working of the eternal spirit, and the blessodness of the Church of the redeemed ? And should not all these be delivered as if we were in earnest, because we are in earnest? I must leave it to you to deter. rine for yourselves whether you can best speak, then, for Christ from or without a manuscript. I believe generally the best course is to preach once each Sunday a written and once an unwrltten sermon,-by no means one which has been committed to memory, but one which, through fresh uttering3 of the moment, is the product of thought and study and prayer; for the written sermon secures exactness and variety and the unwritten the habit of speaking to our people from the heart to the heart, insteaof reading a composition in their presence. It would help us, again, this mode of preaching, if we remembered constantly that for the great mass of our people preaching is and must be 1 the great instrument God uses for converting souls; and it is only through this that the dullmonotony of a life of worldliness is ever broken in upon by that stirring of the spiritual affections which belongs to God's mercy. It is from my conviction of the great importance of reaching these affections, and especiaUy at such a time, that I would urge you to aim specially at producing this result by short sermons, fuller than usual of affectionate appeals and devotional thoughts, before the administration of the Lord's Supperintheohurohes. I know the difficulties which indispose some of you to this. Youl feel that It aU tends to a lengthening of the service; but I would rather that you should shorten the singlng, or, after reference to me, divide the service according to the declara tion made by the bishops, than that you should not preach, however shortly, before celebration. The more frequent administration of that holy Sacrament is another means I would mention to you for raising the tone of our ministry. The system of the Church of England plainly supposes a weekly communion in our parishes where three or four communicants can be found to receive it with the minister. And while such a frequency of celebration would probably diminish the numbers present at each time of the administration, it would, I have no doubt whatever, increase the total number of communicants. But even if this frequency is, as a general rule, impossible, we may do something, and much has been done, Iam thankful to say, in this diocess. In the year 1848 there were in the diocess six churches in wzhich the holy Communion wasa administered three times a year. There were 238 churches in which it was administered only four times, and there were only 98 churches in which the celebration wras monthly, and seven in which it was weekly. Whereas by your last returns I find that tbere are but three where it is administered only thrice in the year, and they the smallest parisbes in the diocess, in which the greater frequency from absolute absence of the necessary number has been at times impossible. There are now 306 churches wthere it is administered monthly and at the greater festivals, and 20 when the celebration is weekly and even more frequently, while I gather that 29,335 are in the habit of par. taking of the Holy Eucharist. I have no doubt the number is even treater than this, but, gratifying as is this increase, I would earnestly beg of those who have not yet done so to bring up the number of their coinmunicns to a monthly celebration. Many are doing this, and from the communications I have bad with others pre. paratory to this visitation I find that they have resolved to adopt the same course, and I have no doubt that the number of communnicants as well as the attendants will be increased by this nmeans, and the cause of God proportionately advanced among us. The reason commonly given by those who wish to a&here to an unfrequent celebration inthat their communicants are few. This reason appeas to me to involve a double error. It forgets that there is not a surer way of increasing the attendance than by multiplying the services; and next it overlooks the great truth that the whole machinery of grace is intended for the fow who do, and not for the many who do not, profit by it. I will mention only one more duty, and that I think a very important one. We ought far more than we do endeavour to impress upon heads of families and employers of labour the duty of using thoir influence with their dependents as the means of brngng them rogularly to God's worship iu their parish churches. We have neglected here a great instrument of usefulness. It Is, of course, easy to ask what use is there in their coming to the house of God, and pleasing their earthly masters But surely the answ er is easy. What the secondary motive here does is only to bring men under the influence of the means of grace To convert the soul is the high prerogative of God the Holy Ghost. The utmost we can do is to lot down the net, and leave the filling of it to Him. And what, after all, is plainer than that God is pleased to draw men to a higher law of service through their observance of the lower? And, my brethen of the laity, suffer me as the chief pastor of this diocess to use this opportunity of our being gathered here together to press upon you affectionately this great truth, Among the chief hindrances to the success of their ministry which the Clergy at this visitation have returned me, numbers of them have mentioned the lack of aistanca which they might receive from you. I find among them such answers as these :-" The apparent in. differenee of rich and the consequent degradtion of poor," ' the want of lay aid," "indifference of masters in my parih to the character of the labourers," " the bad charac. ter of landlords; their indifference to the spiritual condition of those who work for them," "the great increase of worldly spirit among the middle and rising classes, and their aversion to anything approachingChurchdisciplineoraauthority." Suffer me, my brethren of the laity, affectionately, bat earnestly, as in God's sight, to remind you thbat for the use of our influience, as for every other talent, we must render up an account at the great day, and your influence in this matter is, believe me, very great indeed. In most of our parishes our congregations would be weUnigh doubled if its leading laymen and employers of labour would exert themselves to get their own dependents and labourersto attend with them tho house of God. And great indeed, rely upon it, would be your reward,-here in the increased respect and affection which such care of their souls would bring on those that work, and hereafter the rich reward of souls whom those exertions had mainly helped to gain over to God and be saved. One means to this end I would earnestly impress on all employers of labour in this diocems,-I mean the practice of never paying their labourers upon a Saturday night. The simple change of pay-day to Fridaywould removegreat hindrances to the attendance at church on Sundays, and would permit, in many instAnces, whole families both of workmen and of shopkeepers, by whom the workmen are mainly supplied with provisions to attend. Of ourother work throughout the diocess I am able.to speak with thankfulness. The Theological College at Caddeaden was opened for the reception of students at Michaelmas, 1854. Since that time to lchaelmas, 1857, 78 students have esLeed Of the3e 36 have been ordained to the ministry within the dioess of Oxford, and 16 to oures in other dlioeses, five have not proeeded to ordination, and 21 are still in the coUege, which is now quite fuL The demand for the curatse trained at Cuddesden hax been equal to fuUy doube tho Iumber the college is ble tospply. Whether the build. after longer experience; meanwhile the establishment of exhibitions is a question I have much at heart, and hope, throngh God's blessing, to uee it carried through. The pay. meats of students sre fied at the lowoest standard consistent with making the college self-supporting. There are many anxious to avail themselve of it, who find that additional years at college after auniversity education are too expensive for them, but it is not intended as a substitute for, but As an addition to, the university career. All thatIhave yet seen of the effects of this attempt to prove the ministerial character of our younger clergy has more than equalled my expectations, andful61led the hopes which I ventured to express in my last charge. The value of such results caunot be exaggerated, aud you will, I trust, remember these institutions in your prayers. Culham Collegehasalso contlnued to fiourish during the fewr years it has been established, about which there has been a remarkable absence of an infant institution, it having sprung up at once as it were to maturity, and already sent ont 86 teachers. His Lordship then prooeeded to speak of the importance of pupil teachers being multiplied in the county, and recom. mended tbatthose who came up to Culham should be able to play on the orga. or harmonium. The work of Christian charity in those houses of mercy at Clewer and Wantage had also been eminently successful during the last three years, and yielded no slght return for all the labours and prayers and saorifioes of those who had given themselves to save others. Turning from these questions to their great diocesan societies, he might speak with thankfulness and ztitude of the continued support they had received. His rdship proceeded to speak of the efforts which had been made m the last three years to raise funds for the support or maintenance of several diooean institutions buhiding and endowing of churches Great as was the total of this, yet investigation showed how small an income its whole wealth could give to each labourer, if that wealth were equally divided among them. Even yet it vwas scarcely understood at how low a rate of remuneration the Church of England, from the social position of its clergy, obtained the services of so large a number of higuly educated men. It had been calculated that the clergy brought into tho common fund some three times the amount of the income they received. He believed that this calculation, instead of being an exaggeration, fell below the fact. The amount of their contributions to educational purposes, to di. rect charity, and to the good of all around them filled him, he must truly say, with great and continually increasing wonder. Never would any approximation to the truth of this subject be generally attained unless, which God forbid, the evil day for the poor and for the religion of our own land I should ever come which severed from ewh other the Church and State of England. His Lordship next stated that he should continue his pastoral letter to the clergy annually on behalf of these excellent institutions. The BookhaWinz Society, and its increasing sphere of usefulness, was glanced at, as also the Church Missionary Society. The great missionay arm of the church amid our colonies and dependencies, the Gospel Propagation Society, was next referred to by his Lordship. Never was there a time when the claims of our colonial church were prese more immediately upon us by the startling events of God'sjudgments. Never was a time when He was doing more to make us feel that our national greatness was for Him, and at the mere breath of His displeasure It would melt into nothingness like a dream " when one awaketh," Might they listen to His voice, and, whether laity or clergy, set them. selves in His strength to do His work with more sincerity, zeal, and loving self-denial. From our diocesan concerns (said his Lordship) I tur for a fewr minutes to those matters of g"eneral interest to the church in which we take our share. The two Houses of Convocation in this province have, as most of you are aware, continued their sittinCs through. these years with regularity, and their consultations with increasing interest; and I cannot but recommend you to make yourselves familiar with the pub. lished journals of their proceedings, and especially with the important reports of several of their committees. Of other matters, perha the most Important Is that of the docision of the highest aurt of Appeal in causes ecclesiastical which has, I trust, set finally at rest many questions which,, while they remained in doubt, did cause some disquiet to the minds of many conscientious members of the church. The peace which God in His mercy has given to us in this diocess on these matters makes it needful for me to speak but on two points in that judgment. From the report of that judgment I am led to think that in the conducting of our public services we are violating what we are reminded is the plain and express law of this church and realm, and to obey which, now that it is so pointed out, we of the clergy are in conscience bound by our oaths and promises at our ordinations, our licensing, and our institution. The points to which I refer concern, first, the uso of embroidered linen and lace on the communion table at the time of the administration of the holy communion. This is decided by the Court to be inconsistent with the meaning of the rubric, which preecribes the use of a fair white linen cloth, and it is consequently our duty to abstain from the use Of such ornaments. Nor need we be pained by their abandonment; for, though they have been doubtless often introduced in that noble spirit of devotion which longs to offer to God's service whatever is most precious and most beautiful, yet if their removal tend to maintain in our churches that chaste simplicity whioh so highly distinguishes us from the tawdry and tinsel trappings of Roman worship, we need not doubt that the safety of our people's souls and the honour of God are quite as really promoted as they were of old, when Hgezelkah, not without some reproach in his day, took away the high places and altars, and said unto Jerusalem and Judah, "Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem.n The second poLt in the judgment to which I must call your attention Is that which states that the order of the rubric is, that the broad and wine to be used in the Holy Communion re to be Ut by the priest himself, and by no other, on the comonmuion table between the reading of the offertory sentences and the prayer for the church miltant. The words in the judgment on this point are these :-" The rubric directs that at a certain point in the course of the communion servicefor this, no doubt, is the true meaning of the rubric-the xminister shall place the bread and wine on the communion Itable, but where they are to be placed previously is nowhere stated. In practice they are usually placed on the communion table before the commencement of the service, but this certainly is not according to the order prescribed. Nothing seems to be less objectionable than a small side table froni which they may be conveniently reached by the officiating minister, and at the Proper time transferred to the comnmumon table." These are, I say, the words of the judgment delivered for us in this high court of appeal, and to this, as to the tormer noint, we are bound to yield our ungrudging assent. It is one thing to have fallen in, as many of us have, from the wish to avoid giving offence by continuing a custom which has been common; it is quite another thing per. versely to continue such a custom when the highest legal sentence warns us that it is not according to the order prescribed-not, therefore, according to that which we have promised to obey; and when the voice of loving authority calls us, as it does in this judgment, to abandon the custom, a continuation of the old course would be Wilfuly to violate our forms of canonical obedience, and to introduce into our common service the occasion of inevitable divisions. One other subject of general interest I must detain you upon for a few moments, It is not my intention to take with you on this occaslon a general review of recent legislation as especially affecting our church; bat there is one matter I must, from its essential importance, make an exception-I mean the rece-it alteration in the law of marriage and divorce. Until the last session of Parhament marriage was by the law of the land, as it still is by the law of the church, a contract indissoluble during the lifetime of the contracting parties, for I cannot allow any weight to the faliaclous objection of that assertion which alleges that some marrisaes have been annually dissolved by Parliament ; that the law of England therefore declared marriage to be dissoluble. The mere fact that a speCal relief was required to dissolve marriage proved that by the law which the prisetgiure suspended marriage was indissoluble, just as those Acts which Parliament annually passed to enable certain parties, as, for example, the contractors of a new railway, to take the landof the proprietors who arennwlllint to sell prove only that by the ordinary law of England owners casnot be compeled to part with their property. No one will venture to deny that the introduction of such a nostrum would be an entire and startling alteration in the law of property, Nor, again, was there any truth in the allegation that the bishops of the church by suffering these pr eVilaQ to pass unchallenged had lost the right of consistently opposing the introduction of a law providing for the ordinary practice of divorce ; for it is a principle of Parliamentary practice that when one or more private Acts have passed granting some special lioense they become precedents, to be set aside only by some subsequent general legislation, which created a plea for all persons in precisely the same eircumstances to claim a similar enactmentin theirfavour. Now thesepi-s,ia were private Bills. The first of them was opposed most vehemently by the bishops, and their silence on their repetition was only in obedience to the general principle with which they regard private Acts, and left them, therefore, at perfect lberty to protest against a general alteration of the law which introduced a jiew and vicious principle into the jurisprudence of our country. The law of the land, then, observe, h sbeen altered, and the opposition made by us, the bishops, to that alteration was not in contrast with our former conduct. I will not here enter Into that question how far the law so altered is or is not in accordance with the law of God. We all, probably, are convinced that in one important respect, at least, there is such a variance. We may fairly differ upon the question how far that varianoe extends, but what I wish you especially to notice is, that by this legislation that old harmony of two distinct codes expressed so happly in our ordination service in the words, "1As thts church and this realm doth receive the same," which enabled us with such full and undivided loyalty to obey both in one, has been rudely broken, and the law of the land and the law of the church is for the first time, as far as I know, put into direct opposition to each other; and, secondly, I would have you to notico that we, in our capacity as clergy of the national church, are required to perform, or to allow others to perform in our churches for us, certain solemn religious acts, the performance of which at the same time is forbidden to us by the law of our churob Most dangerous consequences seem tD me to be likely to foUow from suoh a state of things - for, first, such an opposition, separating the law of the land and the law of the church, tends more than any. thing else to dissolve that union between the church and State in this land which has for so many years yielded such blessings to both; and accordingly this enactment was advocated in Parliament by thebitter opponents of ourchurch establishment with insulung taunts at our condition; and next, and beyond this, such legislation seems to me to involve principles which are directly at varianco with the claims of Christianity itself to be the revelation of the will of God. For if the church of Christ, mark you, doss posses such a deposit, and if her laws are the transcript and the expression of it, then toallowanybody extrnal to henelf to alter those laws is to allow them to tarper with the deposit. Itie allowing that the State possesss th right o1 dictating what we the authorized clergy shall or shrll not teach a the truth of God. How absolutelysubrive of the claim of the Church to reoelve andset forth the revelation from God himself I And if, once more, we would estimato to what 6onsequeuces such coacessions mnay soon praotioally lead in our own case, we mut take Into account this r f eraideralion, that under our representative form of government th4. most active powers of the State arb wielded by a majority of a body into which are freely admitted those who have avowedly opposed all our dlstinctive, teaching. Nor let it be said that these conclusions are in any degree averted by the paltry 6onessdons that a&s to one clss of such marriages the State does not require individual clergymen to act contrary to their own con-l sciences. In trath, it does appear to me that in the' whole course of this vicious legislation this so-called concession is the most faulty spot-faulty everywhere, As sheltering no principle and involving fresh confusion, as in no respect preserving the Church's truth and yet as yielding to scruples of individuals Twhat they have no right to ask. For if that which is unsariptural be not a violation of the Churoh'slaw then no clergymanhas nylight to entertain a private scrupie As to obeying the Act, and to yield him an immunity as to obedience is injuring those who have a right to his services, and is setting a perilous ' examplefor admitting publio offloers on the plea of private opinion to violate that law which is to be the common xule of alL But if, on the other hand, that which is enacted Is. a violation of the Church's law, then no clergyman ought to be allowed to perform it, not because this Act wrill cross any, scruples of his own or violate his own conscience but becaube it violates the law of his Charcb, and so is an injury and n insult and a detlon to that Church, and every member of it. ior I am most anxious that you, my lay brethren, should distinctly. understand that this is not a question concerning us clergy with any particularity of application to us, but It concerns every one of you equaUy, for the purity of the faith and the certainty of its being propounded to us by Divine authority are treasures juast as precious to you as to us It is this, anD not our scruples, which are brought into questioa by this Act, for 1a body externl to the Church can claim the right to alter a law in the Church-the. law of matrimony-then it may at another time seek to alter the law of baptism or the Lord's Supper, or to interfere with our creeds. And romember, this is not a queston as to who has in the Church the right of revising these matters. I am not arguing that this should rest with the clergy rather than with the laity, but merely that It is a right inalienable for the Church herself, that it is a power which she cannot abdicate in favour of any external body, but must use herself in whatever way or degree she deems right, and it belongs to her laity and clergy and bishops, according to Christ's ordinance, to exercise It lawfaUy. It is, believe me, most important that the clergy and laity of our church should weigh this matter wel, for depend upon it if this alteration is successfuUy established, the principle involved in it will not be allowed to sleep. The same external power which has interfered with the Church's law of marriage will interfere with her Book of Common Prayer, and we shall have the attempt made from the vantage ground of previously permittod encroachments to thrust upon us an altered form of our printed Prayer Book. There were two ways in which this evil might have been avoided,-first, in exact harmony with the best precedents of past times, the English church might have been required to revise her law on the subject,-and I am far from willing to dogmatize as to what relaxation she might or might not have been enabled to allow; and, secondy, the Church might have considered what marriaes she be. lieved to be expedient, and then have provided for their legal celebration by that system of civiloontract for which the full machinery is already at work, and her authority would have been supreme. Unhappily, neither of these courses was adopted, while the dangerous one was foUowed and-I pmy you to mark it-was performed, and was justi. fied by tho yet more threatening assertion of the Attorney. General, that it was the duty of the clergy as the ministers of the national ohurch to do whatever the State ordered them, drawing therein a picture of a national church as being necessarily, because she is national, utterly degraded, as incapable of retaining truth, as powerleas as a witness or instrument of good. This certainly is the bitterest invective which any of her bitterest enemies has ever endeavoured to apply to her. Our duty under these painful circumstances seems to me to be plain. We cannot let the matter rest where it is. For whether or not we think that the innocent parties ought to be set free from an adulterous union and suffered to marry again is not the question. It is, whether for ourselves and our children we can permit the Church of this land to be degraded from being a witness for God, to be a mere earthly machinery, and to speak the words which the State may put into her month. And against this we ought to protest, by requiringth tthese marriages, which the State resolves to legalize against the Church's law, should be contracted before the civil magistrate without the profanation of our appointed prayers through their use, which words cannot onesty apply, rather thau we should submit to a degradation of our apostolical communion by having a variation in our church's doctrines and in the faith which she has once for all received, or that she should be dictated to in matters of such momentous importance by any earthly authority. And now, my brethren, after this review of our affairs within the diocess, and this light touching upon the general affairs of our Church, I part from you, commending yoU to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inhentance among all them that are sanctified. May He by His holy spirit-may He by His exceeding mercy, accept for Chriss sake our poor labours I May He enable us to remember more abundantly in all our ministrations that It is His glory in the conversion and sanctfication of souls, for which alone we labour. May He make us to be more of one mind in His vork,-free from party spirit, free from personal peon liarities,-and enable us to avoid fal g into extremes of opinion in the pracice of Hi4s ord-tender forbearing, loving, consearntious, and, above all, may say active ! May the Spirit of PenCe enable us to be at peace among ourselves, enabling us, wherever we see activity in His work among our brethren, to work heartily and trastigly with theom, that oven thogh there may be upon some points a slight and perhaps inevitable difference of viows between us, may He enable us to remember howr short at the longest is our days of service, how near our sentence, how near our doom, how near our eternal recompense! Surely all things around ns teach us this lesson. Of you, my reverend brethren, wFho are only the* incumbentWs of this diocess, 37 have been taken to their great accoaunt since my last visitation. For myself I have had the warn. ing that of aU my predecessors in this see since it was founded but six have administered the diocess longer, and one as long, as I 'havo served among you, while 18 have had fewer years than the 12 of my episcopate, caUed to render their account and trust to the great Bishop of Souls. With increased earnestness, if I know anything of myself, do I intend pursuing my work, to live as a brother among brethren, to love all, to be loved, if God will, by all, to be prayed for by all, to help you all without distinction or dfference iu your works for Christ, that so through His grace I and wou may finish our course w;ith joy in the ministry which we have received from the Lord Jesus Christ, and testify to the gospel of the grace of G}od. His Lordship and a number of the clergy remained to partake of the Holy Communion, and after wards dined together at the White Hart Hotel.

CAMBRIDGE, Nov. 5. A Congregation was held this day for voting upon questions relating to the new statutes. Ten graces appeared on the paper, si of wshich were opposed and four unopposed. The enate mustered very strong, isage reinforcements of the country clergy having marched in to support the Heresy The first question was the commencement of the Michaelmas, making this the 1st of October instead of the 10th; thrown out in the non-Regent House by a majority of 8,non-placets, 38; placets, 30. The second grace proposed fixing the EAser Taation-to begn on the 7th of April and to end on the 21st of April. 'his was rejected in the non-Regent-house by a majority of 19,-non-placets, 43; placets, 24. The third grace for uniting the two Rouses was rejected by the non-Regents by a majority of 46,-non-placets, 69; placets, 23. Rgnsuoped All the other graces passed the non-Regents unopposed, except the last, which proposed to repeal the provision for a Court of Heresy, consisting of the iour senior Doctors in Divinity, being Heads of Collegs, the three Professors of Divinity, and the Professor of HIebrew, five of whom to be a quorum, and simply to substitute these words: - Nemo doctrinam ant disoiplinam ecclesie AngUcaua legibus publicis stablitam concionando in academi. templo oppuguet." This was rejected by the non-Regents by a msjority of 53,-non-placets, 73; placets, 20. The grace for giving higher degrees to persons in the colonies, though opposed in the Regent-house, was carried by a majority of 16 to 2.

GENERAL HEWITT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-As you were kind enough to insert a letter from me in July last, begging a saspension of public opinion as to the conduct of my brother, General Hewitt, at Meerut, I hope you will now permit me, through your columns, to requesS a littlo time longer-rendered necessary by the disturbed state of the communications,-whenithe whole facts wvll be made known, supported by correspondence and official documents. This correspondence and the documents accompanying will enable the public to judge impartially whether my brother has or has not done his duty, and also whsther official interference with purely military duties has or has not benefited the public service. Old officers, I know, have much to contend against,-indeed, in reading your strictares of yesterday upon anotber Indian general, I perceive physical infirmities much interfered with that officer's efficiency; in the case of my brother there was no such disability. Although in the GSth year of his age he was on the 10th of Mlay strong and healthy. He slept on that night with the men on the ground among the gnns, and for 14 consecutive nights he did the same, during 10 weeks, night and day, woaring his regimentals, except during necessary change. Being confident that the verdict of public opLuion. both as regards the outbreak at Meerut and the passage of tho Rohilound mutineers, will on the facts be with my brother, I trespass en you to permit these few lines, in order that silence may not oporate to his prejudlee. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your mest bedient servant. T. S 1PRWT 9, Viewfield plo%, Stirling NoT. 4.
ZLAV REPORT. COURT OF C-AN-rV T-.. - AT-lrsrnrs - (BeMfoe the " \, ; UV. O. This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Xindersley, dismissing the plaintiff's bill without costs.

This was a suit for specific performance of an agreement to purchasee a portiou of the well-known .,ppuldercombe sate iu the Isle of Wight, with an allowance for compensaton l}tItespect of two alleged iasdescriptions in the particulars of slse. One of them related to certain buildings and premises called Great Span Farm, which were stated to be included in the lot sold to the plaintiff, hut were, in fact, included in another lot; and the other to the quality of a portion of the land sold. The first misdescription had been, as the defendant insigted, cured by an offer to give the plaintiff as part of his purchase the omnitted pre. nmLses. The second involved the question whether a description of land as comnprising "about 37 acres of raeadow and pasture land" was justly applicable to land which consisted of 11 acres of meadow and 26 acres of down land, which were mentioned in detail In the particulars as " asture and feirze?" This land appeared to be down land of a rough description, which had n broken up and used as fox cover, and was, aS the plaintiff contenAed, but an indifferent sheep walk. ViceChancellor Wood held that the plaintiff was entitled to specifle performance of the agreement, Including the omitted buildings, but without compensation for the other alleged mnIsdescription, and from this decision the plaintiff appealcd. Mr. Cairns and Mr. Bevir appeared for the appeal; Mr. Rolt and Mr. Faber were not called upon. Their LORDSHIPS were of opinion that upon the two points before the Vice-Chancellor his Honour was perfeetly right, and that so far the appeal must be dismissed. They, however, directed certain inquiries, which related to the right of the plaintiff to a small piece of land alleged to have been omitted from the sale. YEA! V. EDWARDS. A yeoman named John Yem was possessed of land (by encroachment) of the Forest of Dean, and devised the same to his wife for life with remainder over. By an Act of Parliament, 1st and 2d of Victoria, chap. 42, the possessors of such land had power to have leases at a nominal rent, and also to purchase at a nominal price. The name of John Yem's widow was Inserted in the schedule of the Act as '- holder" of a piece of land. She elected to purchase the fee simple of the land, and obtained a conveyance, and devised the same upon trusts for sale. The Vice-Chancellor Wood held that the lady's will had no operation, and that the remaindermen under John Yem's will were entitled. This was an appeal from that decision. Mr. Jesawl supported the decree of the Court above; Mr. Dowdeswefr (oft e common law bar) and Mr. Southgate were for the appellant. Lord Justice KeiGELT BRUCE said be never saw a more absurd or more hopeless appeal.

Still he was in possession, and took upon himself to devise it to his widow for life with remainder over. Under an Act of Parliament she obtained a convevance in fee, and it bad been gravely contended that ber devisee was entitled to keep it against the remaindermen under her husband's wili. The appeal must, of course, be dismissed with costs. Lord Justice TURNER was of a precisely similar opinion, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
ROILS' COURT. COTANRRYW.T.St Xr- A . - r RIAXWELL V. YATES AY]D THIE PORT TENNANlT PATENT STEAM FMET. A7'n OnaT a (Before the MASTER of the ROLLS.) This was a suit for specific performance of a contract under the following circumstances :-It appeared that the plaintiff, having an interest in the Cadoxton Colliery, lamorgan, and in Levingston's patent fuel, assigned it in 1852 to Mr. Yates (secretary to the Great Eastern Steamship Company), and other gentlemen, for the purpose of forming a public company to be called the Port Tennant Patent Steam Fuel and Coal Company. The price agreed to be given to the plaintiff for his interest In the coliery and the fuel patent was 8,0001., to be paid either in money or shares, and the agreement of the promoters of the company was subsequently eonfirmed and adopted by the company when formed. Owing to certain opposition from the Stock-Exchange, and a settling day not having been assigned to the company by that body, the company has never been able to carry on its operations, and appeared, for the present at least, to be at a standstill. Among other things which the company had omitted to do was to carry out its alleged contract with the plaintiffas tothe assignment of his interest in 1852, and the objoect of the present suit was to compel the company to specific performance. The bill was opposed by the company on the ground that the agreement as to the 8,00L purchase-money for the plaintiff's interest in the colliery and the fuel patent was imcorrectly represented to the shareholders, the plaintiff having, subsequently to his agreement with the promoters of the company, agreed to take between 4,0001. and 5,0001., instead of 8,0004., and this subsequent alteration of his terms not having been revealed to the shareholders, but withheld from them, with an intention of rewarding certain officers of the company who had assisted him in carTying out his plans, instead of in lessening the liabilities of the shareholders, as should have been the case. His HONOUR held this a good defence to the claim for specific performance, and disnissed the plaintiff's bilL Ir. Rc. Palmer, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Deane, Mr. Freeman, and Mr. Jessel appeared in the case.
VICE.CRANCELTTnmRc (YTrrPrz .. IN RE ?NAvv'".. '- - - (Bcfore AireChancd1or Sir R. T- K Mr. Lxsvox applied for an order in this matter under the Settled Estates Act (19th and 20th of Victoria, c. 120) for the examination of a married woman abroad, under these circumstances :-Mr. Noyes, the testator in the case devised certain property in strict settlement, and numerous parties were entitled under his will, and among others Mrs. dams, the lady in question, who was resident at Geneva nd as it was asked by the petition which had been presented that a certain portion of the estates should be sold, a question of title was involved, and it was therefore necessary to take her consent. It was proposed to appoint a gentleman named Edgar Smith, who was a certificated solicitor of this court, but practising in Paris, to proceed to Geneva, but a question arose upou the 38th section of the Act whether that would be the proper course, and by the desire of the chief clerk the matter was now mentioned to the Court. That section enacted that the consent should, in a case like the present, be taken either by the Court, or by some solicitor duly appointed by the Court for the purpose, who should certify that he had examined her, &o., and that she consented, being aware of the nature of the transaction, &c. There was a question whether this autho. rized a commission ? The VICE-CHANWELLOR said his opinion was that this section did not authorize a commission, but the examination must be either by the Court itself or by a solicitor duly appointed by the Court. A case occurred where the lady was In the back woods of America, where there was a dlfculty to find a solicitor. The solicitor must be certificated at the present moment, for, as it was in the discretion of the Court to appoint a fit person, there ought to bc the means of Judging of the fitness. The chief clerk would see to the details if he was applied to. MIr. Smith was not (his Eonour presumed) the solicitor of the husband. (Before Vice-Cihaszcetlor Sir J. ST2.,ART.) iLTRRrS V. MIOR,A2N. This was a suit for the administration of the estate of the late llichard Betteson, of Bath, brewer, who by his will dated in 1840, gave all his real and personal estate to trustees upon trust, afrter the death or second marriAage of his widow, M2ary Betteson, for " Richard l)alinan, the son of MIary Dahnan, then or lately residing at Empeworth, in the county of Hlan,ts," for life, sod in case Richard Dalman sould die, leaving a child or children at his death, then in trust for such child or children. The testator, Richard Betteson, died in 1849. It appeared that In 1816 the testator married his present widow; that he afterwards, when in service as butler in a gentleman's family, became acquainted with MIary Dalman; that he subsequently set up a school; that in 18'24, when pursuwng the vocation of schoolmaster. he, under the assumed name of Ilichard Harris, married bIary Dalman, his wife, Mlary Betteson being then living; and that Richard Dalman Harris, otherwise Richard Dalman, and called by the latter name in the testator's will, was the fruit of the testator's cohabitation with blary D)alman. The plaintiff, who was the only child of Richard Dalinan Hrarris, otherwise Richard Dalman, who was now dece.ased, claimed to he entitled under the above gift to the testator's real and personal estate, subject to the interest therein of the iesotator's widow, Mary Betteson, during her life ur w idowvhood. The plaintiff's title was not disputed at the bar, and the only question was as to the costs of the stlit. Mr. Mfalice and MWr. Hallett were counsel for the plaintiff; 'M[r. B'acon and Mr. W. W. Cooper for the testator's widow and trustees; and MIr. Craig and Mr. Soutbgate for persons who 'would have been entitled after the death o-r cecond marriage of the testatOr'S wridow, MIary Betteson, in the event of the plaintiff not e.stablishirng his claim. The VICE-C1r.A>iCELLOI1 said that as the qulestion of the identity of the plaintiff's father wvhich ha-i been raised by the sult was one which the tcostator hnd hinmself created, and as the suit was one also for the general admuinistration of the testator's estate, he thought the costs ought to be paicl or;t of such estate. -
'COtRT OF OUEEN'S -li nfl rERTTS V . t .!Nz 1FS AXl (Sittings in Banco, before Lord'CAM PiiBE - COLERIDGE, WIcEITMAN. Owl R- aI{T J Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., moved pursuant to leave reserved for a rule to enter the verdict for the defendants. This action was brought to recover d-rnages for the infringement of a patent granted to the plaintiff oni the l;tlh of January, ,1849, for "anew manufacture of car sules, and of amnaterialto be employed therein, and for other purposes." At the trial, 'which took place before Lord Caw pbell at Westminster, at the sittings after last term, the plaintiff obtained a verdict, leave being at the same time reserved to the defendants to move to enter the verdict in their favour, upon the ground that the plaintiff's patent could cot be simported. The object of the plaintiff's patent was to combine tin with lead 'by means of pressure, so as to make capsules and other articles composed of tinfoil. These had formerly been 'made of tin, which was a much dearer metal, nbut they were now made of lead coated wibh tin by means of pressure. The learned counsel contended there was no novelty in the plaintiff's invention, because before the plaintiff's patent was granted the plaintiff had manufactured a large number of his capsules forsale. Lord C A5spngLL said that some delay bad occurred in obtining '>he patent, in consequence of the law officers of the Crown being absent from town, bu t the plaintiff hadi given 1llstinct and express orders that none of the capsules so made should be sold. It was, howvever, a fair questiosE for 4onsideration whether that was such a publication of the Invention as would deprive the plaintiff of his right to a patent. Mr. SETrx also contended that the plaintiff's patent was bad, upon the ground that the claim was identical with that of Dobbs's patent, granted in 1804. Lord CAMPBELL said that evidence was given to show that without the proportions and direotions given in the plaintiff's speclfications the object could not be effected. Mr. SMITH said, he thought the validity of the patent -was for the Court, but if it was for the jury he contended that the verdiot was against the evidence. The learned oounsel would not dispute that there was an infrineement. Lord CAMPBELL ald that upon that point his opinion was strongly in favour of the plaintiff. Rule nisi zranted. IANIERE V. THE VESTRY OF MILE-END OLD TOWN. Mr. EDw9N JAMEs, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, foraruleto entertheverdict forthe defendants in this case if the Court should be of opinion that the defendants' plea of justification was proved. The action was brought against the vestry of Mile-end Old-town for removing a trough and shed which they alleged was an obstruction in the street, and which they were justified in removing by the 120th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act (the 18th and 19th of Victoria,chap. 120). At the trial which took place at Westulnater before Mr. Justice Wightman at the sttings after last term the plaintiff obtained a verdict, It being reserved to the Court to decide whether, upon the facts In evidence, the defendants' plea was proved. The COURT granted a rule nus. BLACKXOBE V. THE BRISTOL AND EXETER RAILWAY COalPANY. Mr. PN, QC., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to show cause why the nonsuit in this case should not be set aside, and a verdiot entered for the plaintiff for 2501. damages. The action was brought by the plaintiff as administratix of her deceased husband, to recover damages for the death of her husband, occasioned, as alleged, by the negligence of the company's servants. It appeared at the trial, which took place before Mr. Justioe Coleridge at the last assizes held at Bristol, that the company had contraoted with a person named Harvey ior the carriage of a quantity of stone in their truoks, it being one of the terms of the contrast that Harvev should unload the stone from the trucks into his carts. ft appeared that, in point of fact, the company provided a orane for this purpose, but whether this was compulsory or only voluntary did not appear. Harvey's men were engaged in unloading the stone, and called upon the deceased to assist, and while he was so engaged the chain of the crane gave way, and the man was khed. The evidence showed that the chain was defective, and that this was known to the company. It was contended on the part of the company that they were under no obligation to supply a crane, and that they could not beheld responsible for the defect in the crne, wvhich they had simply alloed the use of. The learned Judge nonsui'ted the plaintiff, hut with the consent of both parties he assesaed the damages contingently at2501., and gave the plaintlff leave to move to enter the verdict for that amount. The learned counsel now contended that the company was responsible for the defect in the crane, even if they had merely lent It, but Lord CAMPBELL Intimated his opinion that such an argument was untenable. Hs Lordship inquired whether the stones could have been unloaded without a crane, and on being answered in the negative expressed an opinion that, though nothing was said abeut the use of the crane, there was an Implied undertaking to supply a crane, and if so it ought to have been in a state fit for use DACRY V. THE SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY. Mr. Serjeant BALLANTINE (with whom was Mr. F. H. Lewis) moved for a rule for a new trial in this case. The action was brought against the South-Eastern Hallwty Company to recover damages for an injury done to the plaintiff, a little boy, by the alleged negligent driving of the defendants' carman. At the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell at Guildhall at the sittings after last term, it appeared 'hat the little boy was coming up a very narre - street in Whitechapel, formerly called Petticoat-lane, ba now known as Midlesex-street, when he met one of the company's waggons going down the street from Whitechapel. The boy fell under the wheels and was seriously injured. The jury found their "verdict forthe defendants, the evidence not clearly showing that the plaintiff was knocked down by the waggon; but the jurydesire to express their opinion that the most culpable negligence was sbown by the carman In charge. The jury also consider it desirable that Middlesex-street shall not be passed through by such ponderous vehicles." Lord CAMPBELL said the learned serjeant might take a rule to show cause. LA{MERT V. SrDEBOTTOlI. Mr. BOVILL, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Needham) moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict in this case, which had been found for the defendant, should not be set aside and a new trial granted. The case was an interpleader issue directed to try whether oertain goods which had been seized in execution by the defendant on the 8th of July last were the property of the plaintiff, as ainst the defendant. At the trial, which took place before Chief Baron Pollock at the last assizes for Surrey, the jury found their verdict for the defendant. The learned counsel now moved for a new trial on the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was agaiast the evidence. It appeared from the learned counsel's statement that the goods in cues. tion formerly belonged to a Mr. Adkuss, who resided at Winterson-house Brompton. Adkins was a man who had become known to the world as formerly the keeper of a gambling-house, whose transactions had come before the public on the trial of an action in which Culverwell was the plaintiff and Sidebottom was the defendant. Subsequently an aotion was brought by Sidebottom against Adkins to recover back a large sum of money lost at play, upon theground that it had been unfairly won by means of loaded dice. In anticipation of the trial of this action Adkins wished to dispose of the lease of his house in Brompton, and also of his furniture therein, and ultimately he sold the plaintiff the lease for oOOl.. and the chief portion of the furniture for 800l. The purchase was completed on the 18th of June, and possession given, but the plaintiff left Adkinss cook in possession till the 22d of June, when the action of " Sidebottom v. Adkins" was tried, which resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, the present defendant. He then put another person in possession of the goods, and when execution was put in by Sidebottom he (tte present plaintiff) claimed thegoods as his property. At the trial the plaintiff was examinea to prove the purchase of the goods, which he said was bond fidr, and though he admitted he had a knowledge of Adkins on the turf and at Tattersall's he denied that he was at all intimate with him. The learned counsel contended that the learned Chief Baron had not left the right question to the jury. Hle ought to have asked them to say whether the sale to the plaintiff was bond fide or merely colourable; instead of which he had called upon them to say whether or not the plaintiff ought not to have called Adkins and other witnesses to show the nature of the transaction. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that there ought to be nei rule granted. The summing up of the Chief Baron was unexceptionable. Tho question was whether, under al the circumstances, there had been a bond jide transfer of the property by Adkins. The Chief Baron had a strong Impression on his mind that it was a fraudulent proceeding, but he did not take the decision of that upon imself, but left it to the jury. If they had not concurred with the Chief Baron they would have found their verdict the other way. In considering the question whether there had been a bond fide transfer of the property, theju would take it into oonsideration whether the not callng Adkins did not fortify the suspicions which the other parts of the case raised. If they thought the conduct of the plaintiff was fraudulent he (Lord Campbell) could not say the Jury were wrong. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said he thought that if the question had been left in a different way to the jury they might have come to a different opinion. It seemed, however, that, as the question was left to them, the jury had adopted the suspicions of the Chief Baron. He (Mr. Justce Coleridge) would have been better pleased if the matter were to undergo another inquiry. Mr. Justice WIGHTM.AN and Mr. Justice ERJ,E concurred in the opinion of Lord Campbell, and thought that the question of the bon/2 fide transfer of the property should have been left to the jury, and that there was no reason why the verdict should be disturbed. Rule refused. THIZ 'RLNCE OF WALES ASSURANCE COIMPANY V. THE AT11EN:}'UM ASSURANCE COMTPANY. Sir F.

The COURT granted a rule niei. ELKI5NS V. hMURPHY. Mr. M. CHAM-HERS, Q.O., moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict found for the defendant in this case should not be set aside, and a new trial granted, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was brought to recover damages for warranting that he had the authority of a Mr Toulmin to sell a house to the plaintiff, when, as alleged, he had no such authority. The jury had been locked up nine hours before they found their verdict, which the learned counsel contended was contrary to the The COURT granted a rule to show cause. FROMSE V. ASHDOuYh- AIND OTIIERS. Mr. HAW hINS moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict in this case, which had been entered for the defendants, should not be set aside and entered for the plain. tiff, for 2001. The defendants were the promoters of the Hungerford-hall Dining Company, and they had passed a resolution requesting their solicitor, the plaintiff, to pay the sum of 2001. to a person interested in the building, which they were desirous of securing for the purposes of the company, resolving at the same time that be should be repaid out of the first moneys which should be received bv the company. The defendants contended that they were not to be held personally liable; but the plaintiff con. tended that they were liable, not only because of their resolution requesting the plaintiff to advance the money, but because of a previous resolution by which it was resolved that all the preliminary expenses should be paid by the promoters. In fact, a sum of 381. had been paid in to the bankers of; the company, so that the plaintiff, at all events was entitled to be paid that amount. Lord CAMPBELL said he thought the plaintiff would be entitled to that sum. The learned counsel might take a rule SNOW V. THE PATAGONIAN 3MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A person who represented him,self as the plaintiff in this action said be wished to ask the advice of the Court as to the course he ought to pursne in a matter personal to himself. Lord CAMPBELL asked the applicant what he wanted the Court to do? The applicant said, he wanted to bring an action against the Patagonian Missionary Society for 3081. Lord CAMIPBELL said, he could go and bring his action. The applicant said, he had no means. Lord CAMIBELL said, the Court could not give him the means. The applicant, who seemed somewhat astonished at this response, then withdrew, and the Couri rose. CROINv PAPER.

This was an Snterpleader cause to try to whom certain goods belonged. It appeared that the defendant put an execution- In the bouse of a person named French, a butcher in Whitecross-street. As soon as the execution was putin theoods were claimed b the plaintiff, who stated that In 185D tbe goods of FrencK were distrained for rent, and as French had marrled the sister of the plaintiff he purchased the goods of the offioer in possession, and paid him 791. 2s. 6d. for the same, taking a receipt for the money. The plaintiff, hoiwever, on account of his sister, permitted the goods to remain npon the premises for the use of his sister and her family, and these were the goods which were now taken in execution by the defendant. The case was fully proved by the plaintiff and other witnesses, and The jury returned a verdict ior the plaintiff. SCOTT V. CANI'ON. Mfr. EdwardJames and Mr. Stammers were counsel for the plaintiff; Lr. Edwin James and Mr. Serjeant Parry for the defendant. This was an interpleader case, the question being whether certain goods were the property of the plaintiff or of a person named Charles John Allen. It appeared that Allen had been a bMbroker. He had borrowed 5001. of Mr. Scott, for which, upon an execution, he had afterwards obtained a bMl of sale of Alien's furniture. Allen stated that he was in the habit of adOertiBing to lend money. He applied to one Watson, a matrimonial agent, for a woman with money, and he recommended him to a woman, saying she was worth 6,0001., and he gave him 151. or 201. for the lntroduction. They exchanged likenesses. The por. traits of the ladies were kept in a drawer. The matter was done chiefly by correspondence. They married and went to Paris on theLr wedding tour, as his wife said she wanted to go there to see her sister, but they did not find her there. After the marriage he found that instead of his wife having a fortune she was very much involved. His mother told him that he had made a mistake, for instead of marrying a lady he had married a late lady's-maid. Before his marrrise he had gone down to Cheltenham to see his intended aie, nd found her keeping a maid and a carriage. When people told him of his wife's debtss he said "it was all false; what a wicked world it was, that people should tell such falsehoods." After his return from his tour he had 41. left out of 2501. He took her upon the belief that she was going to be married to somebody else, or he should have made further inquiries. His wife's debts amounted to about 6001., which he had compromised, His wife left him a weekafter their return from Paris. She had come tohis office once since to tender herself. He thought she had had the impudence to call once since. He had brought an action for crim. con., and the damages were assessed at 1001. He had told her he kept a brougham and had 1,0004 a-year. He had borrowed 1001. from the defendant Lust be. fore the marriage, tellng him of the fortune he was about to marry, and he had obtained another 1001. on his return, teling him it was all right, as he at the time believed it was 601. per cent. was allowed on the loan, HiS profits before the war were 1,0001. a-year for three years. The plaintiff had advanced him 1,0001. since the mnarriage.He got deeper into difficulties until he went to Scotland to take the benefit of the Sequestration Act. The defendant put in an execution, and then the plaintiff put in his claim. Would not swear he had not himsef charged r ent. uponloans The furniture was at his mother's, adhehad reddea more there than at his lodgings. He kept a coachman, a footman, and a phaeton-(the examina. tion of Allen created roars of laughter)-and set up a brougham to catch gome one. When the woman told him she was engaged to another, he induced her to start with him and lease the other gentleman in the lurch. Mr. Scott wised Allen's mother to take possession of the furniture a keep it for him, and It had been in her possession ever since. For the defence it was contended, that the question was whether the plaintiff having a debt had used this bill of sale colourably to protect Alien's goods for Allen. The check given by Scott for the 5001. was in favour of Mrs. Allen. Mr. Scott was the trustee for Irs. Allenunder her husband's will, and Mrs. Allen was to have a portion of the interest of this 500b With regard to the matrimonial affair the biter was bitten, end that was all; for Allen, being at the time himself insolvent, was endeavouring to get hold of a gbl with 6,0001. In order to pay his debts. It was not till after the marriage, and a writ had been served for the wife's debt, that Mr. Scott commenced proceedings for the recovery of the 5001. It was therefore submitted that this was a colourable proceeding, and not good in law. Mr. Justice CRoMPTroN,ln summing up, said, the question was, whether at the time the bill of sale was executea it was intended really that the property should pass to Scott to do what he liked with It, or whether it was a mere sham or The juxy found a verdict for the plaintiff,

This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Cresswell, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 7191. Mr. LuSII, Q.C., now moved for a nonsuit or for a new triaL The action was brought on a guarantee given bv the defendant for 1,4001. on behalf of one Kirby, a builder, who wanted to raise money on the mortgage of some house roprty the defendant gUaranteeig, if on a sale of khe property the purchase money should not he sufficient to discharge the money advanced upon It and all erpenses usedby any defectof titleorotherwise, tomakekothe amount good. Kirby became bankrupt, and the houses were put up for sale and knocked down for 9001. That sale was, however, not completed, and on a resale they were knocked down for 6501. to one Watson who signed the contract for sale bu' afterwards on requiring proof that the ground rent had been paid, which could not be given, refusedto complete the purchase, and an action was brought against him to enforce his completion of the contract, and while that action wu pending the preeent action on the guarantee was brought. On the part of the defendant it was contended, that as yet there was no sale, and that the plaintiff might get damages in the acton against Watson, and then put up the property for sale again and get double the money. Rule nisi granted. MONTAGUE V. ULARRIsO. Mr. Serjeant ATXINSON moved for a rule in this case to discharge the defendant out of custody, he having been arrested while attending a court of justice as a prosecutor and witness. It appeared the defendant was bound over as a witness to appear before Mr. Broughton, at Marylebono Police-office, to give evidence on a charge of felony, and wbile so in attendance he was arrested under the roof of the court. The question was whether a witness before a olice magistrate was privileged from arrest. Mr. Baron ghannell, at Chambers, had refused to discharge him. Rule nim granted. SUTTON V. SADLER AND ANOTEMR. This was an action tried before the Lord Chief Justice at Cheater. Mr. GROVE, Q.C,, moved for Pa new trial on the ground of misdirection. The question at the trial was whether a testator was sane at the time of making his wilL This testator was proved to have been sane at one part of his life, and clearly insane for another part of his life. The question was whether he was competent to execute a will at the time when the will was made. In order to prove his competency the defendant called a witness who gave evi. dence of a statement made by the testator with respect to the property which he himself took under his father's will, and the father's will was offered in evidence to show that that statement was a correct one, as evidence that the testator at that time knew the state of his property. The father's will was objected to, and not pressed to be put in evidence. The Lord Chief Justice in summing up told the Jury that it was for them to say whether, as the will was in conrt and objected to by the plaintiff to be put in evidence, it was not to be inferred that the will contained a description of the property agreeing with the statement of the testator. The learned counsel now objected that this was a misdirection because the will was not in evidence for any purpose. Secondly, it was objected that the learned Judge left it to the jury to consider whether the testator when he died did not intend that the defendant should take his property. It was contended that this was likely to direct the attention of the jury more to this fact than to to the testator's sanity when he made the will. The COURT were of opinion that, as to the first objection, the inference was a natural one, which would arise in any man's mind, and that the ruling secondly objected to was not calculated to mislead. Rule refused. MOTTLZE -NVELOPE COmPINy V. SEYNOUR. This was an action for the infringement of a patent for making bottle envelopes.

COURT OF EXCHEQUER. TnTRMn)AV. %n,A x ILIRRIS V. TRE OFFICIAL MANAGER OF THE ROYAL TRPTT-I R A ~' I (Sitting in Banco.) Mr. PnIPSON moved to set aside an order of Mr. Baron Martin made on the 26th of June last, setting aside the judgment obtained in this cause in so far as the lands of Mr. Bingham Baring were concerned. The judgment was obtained in March, and on the 2d of May the plaintiff sought to affect the property of Mr. Baring as a registered shareholderhyregistering a memorandam of the judgment in the Court of Common Pleas, the amount being 4,8601. The judgment was obtained against the bank; the proceeding of the plaintiff took place under the 7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 113, sec. 9, which enacts that- " Every judgment decree or oder in any proceedig agalnt the company may lawfully be executed o9WnuAt and may have the olce effect on the Property and effects of the comPany and also, subject To the provisione hereinafter contained, on the ersn. property, snd effects of every shawreolder and former shareholder, as if every individual shareholder had teen by name a party to such proceedgngt" The effect of the Winding-up Act weas to place the offica manager in the same position as if his name had been used instead of that of the company. The present question turned on the meaning of the words "subject to the provisions hereinafter mentioned." Without those words there would be no doubt that the lands of a shareholder would bo liable to a judgment against a company, hut the contention of the plaintiff was that those words merely referred to the manner and order of executing the judgments, and did not disable the jtudg ment creditor from charging the lands of a shareholder by the registration of his judgment. The order, though purporting to bte made b Mr. Baron Martin, was in fact the order of Mr. Justice Willes, who sat for him, and his Lordship bud stayed the matter till the fifth day of Term, in order that the point might be raised in court. The terms of the order were, that IIthe entry be struck out so far as: Mr. Baring was concerned, there being no judgment entered against him, or anything to warrant such an entry." After some discussion as to the construction of various sections of the Act, The CO = BARox stated that it appeared to be monstrous that a judgment creditor should not be able to touch a shareholder's goods without coming to the Court for leave to issue execution, but that he might of his own motion attach all his real estate, i-bich would follow from the contention of Mr. Phipson. The rule, however, might go, but the proriety of drawing it up was questionable, as it would,inU probability, be discharged with costs. hMr. PHE31SON said, that after that intimation, though the point was one of great importance, he should abstain from taling a rule. The CHF BARoN.-I think you have exercised a very sound discretion. LEE V. DASEUWOOD. Mr. M. SETH, in moving for a now trial, on the ground of misdirection, stated that the plaintiff was the assignee of hesrs. Sadgrove and R&agg, who had acquired such notoriety as whoolesale maanfacturers of aceommodation bills, as appared in the proceedings under their bankruptoy. Their legitimate trade was that of upholsterers, and the defendant being caught by a specious advertisement called at their shop, and selected some articles of furniture and ordered others to be made-on the asrance that they would be all French polished and horsehair stuffed. The defendant paid 60l. down, the whole bill being 1531., and some of the goods were sent to him. On their arrival he ascertained that they were stuffed with cotton, and that there was little or no " French polish" on them. He then complained, and the bankrupts promised to repair all omiBSions in tho goods which had been so sent, and to avoid such faults in those yet to be sent. When the latter appeaed, however, they were as bad as the others, and the dafendant refused to pay for any of the goods, the last lot being warehoused. At the tril the defendant contended that the contract was an entire one, and that, as such, some of the goods having fallen short of the guaranteed quality he was not bound to pay any more than the sum he had paiddown. The learned judge (Coleridge), however, asmued that the contract was not an entire one, and directed the jury to say what the goods were reasonably worth,lwhereupon they gave the plaintff 80l, The Counnt granted a rule as prayed, it being understood that some of tegoods sent on the last occasion had not been selected by the defendsant. Rwule nisi granted.
IZNSOL VENT DEBTORS' 0o0URT, Nv. 5. IN RE W. G. lNORnfAl (Bf'OrC tac Cmxi COMMISONXR.) This insolvent, a journeyman printer, applied to be discharged. He was opposed on behalf of a creditor named Chase, to whom the Insolvent was indebted on account of rent. The complaint was that Mr. Chase's action had been vexatiously defended, and that the insolvent's arre8t was a collusive proceeding. It appeared that the In6olvent had employed one Guy, an accountant, to conduct his law business, and that person, acting as clerk to Mr. Govett, an attorney, had defended the action, and was now performing the business in this court. The detaining creditor was a MIr. Jones, a medical gentleman, who had attended the insolvent for many years, and the arrest was admitted to be a friendly proceeding. Mr. Jones, however, upon being called, sWad, he was quit ignorant of the insolvent being in custody at hls Buit until about a fortnight after the event, neither had he employed Mr. Grayson, who appeared to be the plaintiff's attorney. The CHrEF Co0rsII5 oIEn, said thate after the evidence of Mr.Jones there was no course left but to dismiss the retition. There had been a clearly vexatious defence to Mr. Chase's action, through Guy and Govett, who had contrived to make three law jobs for themselves at the insolvent's expense,-vlz. the defence to the action, the arrest, and the busines inthis court. The arrest in Mr. Jones's name, without that gentleman's knowledge or sanction, was a fraud upon the court, and upon that ground the ettiion must be disssed. He (the learned Commissioner hoped, however, that the insolvent would make some arrangement with Mr. Chase, andnotfaliagaininto such hands as he had lately been in. With respect to Mr. Govett and Mr. Guy, he should consult with the other Commissioners whether those persons should in future have the opportunity of playIng such tricks on this court, Petition dismissd.
1POLIOE. MAINSION-HOUSM-The LoRD MAYOR requested that the press would aeknowledge the receipt of 21. from M. H. Treachor, Esq., as a donation to the poor-box. GUILDAL-David Rees Davies was charged with frauds upon the benevolent. Thomas Jewin said,-I am In the employ of Messrs. Gren. feU and Co., copper merchants of Upper Thames-street. In January last paid the prisoner a subscription, and on the 29th of September last the prisoner called again for a similar subscription in aid of the Mint Borough Ragged Schools. I paia him 21. 2s., and he gave me the receipt produced. At the time I paid him I believed he was authorized by the school to receive the subscription. I entered both eubsecriptions in the collection book that was found on the prisoner. Boroford, the Mendicity Society's officer, here produced the book. Witness.-The signatures to the subscriptions I paid for Messr Grenfell and Co. In January and September last are in my handwriting. Sir P. I&sRM-It appears by this book that this Is a gross impositiou, and has been carried on to a considerable e=tent. Have you any question to ask this witness ? Prisoner.-I merely wish to ask him if I did not say I wanted to get a child into St. Ann's schooL Sir PErER L&.UxrL-Did you give him this paper (the receipt produced) ? Prlsoner.-I did, Sir. Sir PnB LAun=-Well, your wishing to get a child into St. Ann's School cannot have any connexion with your obtaining this subscription. Mr. Edward Budd said,-I am a copper merchant at Castle Baynard wharf. On Saturday last the prisoner caUed on me, but I did not pay him any money at that time, although I had previously. When he came he sent in by one of my clerks a receipt for a subscription to the Mint Borough Sagged Schools. I paid the previous subscription for the Red Cross Ragged Schools, and upon reading the receipt I saw the prisoner and asked him if it was a fact that he had been dismissed by the Rev. Mr. Cadman from the Red Cross Ragged School for misconduct. His reply was that he had left Mir. Cadman's schools be. cause they had been torn down, but that he had established another sehool of his own, caled the Mint SchooL at which he was instructing a great number of the boys who used to attend Mr. Cadman's school. In reply to the charge of being dismissed by Mr. Cadman for misconduct he produced a letter written by the Rev. Mr. Cooke, the curate, giving him a good character, which so staggered me for the moment that I let him go without giving him into custody, although I had caUed in a policeman. I, however, detained the collecting.book produced and the letter containlng his character. Sir PETER LAuRiE.-Is that letter a genuine one? Mx. Budd.-I believe so Sir Peter; for I have seen the Rev. Mr. Cadman since * he informed me that the prisoner obtained that letter without his knowledge. After this I was at the Union Club wherel received a letter from the prisoner, stating that he was gaUty of telling falsehoods, that he did not live where he had stated, that he had no school now, although he had had several since he left Mr. Cadman's, and that he had worked hard and bettered their condition materially, and he appealed to me as a man of feeling, ready to assist the distressed, not to do anything to in3ure him in this matter until the folowing imonday, when he promised to call u on me. I applied to the secretary of the Ragged School Unison at Exeter-hall, from wvhom I received information that the prisoner was an impostor of the worst description. The prisoner was remanded. WEmSTSmT .-Elizabeth Griffiths, a servant to a lady named Butt, residing at No. 4, Belgrave-road, was charged before Mr. ARNOLD with stealing a white satin dress lined with white lace, a crimson velvet mantle lined with ermine, a valuable shawl, a scarf, five headdresses, and other articles, valued at above 2001., the property of Mrs. Hudson, wife of Mr. G. Hudson, raiway director, who has apartments at the house. It appeared from the evidence of a woman named StUlwell, living at No. 17, Hendon-place, that on the previous afternoon her chUd, Emily Stillwell, who is about 10 years of age, brought her a bundle which she said was given her by the prisoner, who wished her (witness) to take care of it til the evening, when she would call for it. Mrs. Stilwell opened the bundle, when, on finding that the contents comprised the valuable articles above described, she consulted with a neighbour what was to be done. Her neighbour remarked that she thought the articles had been stolen. Upon that suspicion she went and gave information to Mrs. Butt, who applied to Mr. Humphreys, the inspector, who at once directed Fells, A. 238, to inqnire Into the case. In answer to Mr. ARNOLD, Mrs. Stillwell said that she had seen the prisoner once before. Emiy Stillwell was called, but, as she had a very imper. fect notion of the nature of an oath, which was elicited in answer to questions put to her by Mr. ARNOLD, the worthy magistrate declined to examtne ber. Mrs. Martha Harriett Butt said that Mrs. Hudson resided at her house, and that the prisoner had been her servant about two months. She had lost a white lace jacktet. Sergeant Fells stated that he took the prisoner into custody at No. 4, Belgrave-road. He told her that she was charged with stealing a quantity of property belonging to Mrs. Hudson, and he informed her that she need not say anything unless she liked. She then said that she took the things out of a box in the drawing-room. Shortly after Emily StiUwel came, when she stated in tho prisoner's presence where she had taken anotber bundle by the pri. soner's direction. The prsonor admitted having sent the bundles by the child. (The property was produced, and it was stated that the shawl cost about 1001.) Mr. ARNOLD asked if mrs. Hudson were present? Mr. Humphreys replied that she was not. She was of a very advanced age, and was too unweU to attend. Mr. Hudson also was out of town. Mr. ARNOLD remarked that he should remand the prisoner, and said that if, on the next examination, Mrs. Budson was still unable to attend he would hear the evidence of Mrs. Hudson at her residence, where the prisoner must be taken. Be also gave directions to Mfrs. StillweU to let her child be taught before the prisoner was brought up again the nature of an oath, so that she might be sworn as a witness. The prisoner was then remanded for a week. WORSH-STREET.-Gtatherme Engel, a young German woman of some personal attractions, was charged with robbery. Mlr. James Deutz, landlord of the Netherlands Hotel in Commercialstreet, Whitechapel, said,-The prisoner has been in my service for four months. That time ago she came over here from Germany to join her sister, who was going to New York. On finding her sister had started before she got here she cried very bitterly, and, as she was entirely without money, I allowved her to stay a few days till I could get some situation for her. I found, however, Ithat I could not find her any situation, and, as she was wrholly friendless over here, I thought I would keep her myself as a houasemaid. Yesterday morning, at 9 o'clock, she brought me the key of my bedroom, as it was usual for her to do, and five minutes xfter left to go to another homse of mine in the same street. A few minutes later I wentt up to my room, and, on unlocldng the door, was surprisea to find that a leather portmanteau, which I kept under my bad for safety, had been stolen. It contained 87 20-frano pieces belonging to a German pamenger lodging in my houre, and who had given them to me to take care of, and 21 sovereigns, my ownt money, in a pocketbook. The trunk was stolen without the key, which Ihad inmy possession all the time, and I inforraed the police of the robbery, as the prisoner had disappeared also, and was nowhere to be found. Mr. Isac Solomons.-I am an interpreter, and also a friend of the prosecutor. From what he told me I went ta the Eueson-square station of the North-Western Railway at 6 last night, and at 20 minutes to 8 saw the prisoner in the booking-office, dressed in a new cloak and bonnet. Being so altered, I doubted at first whether it was she, but when ± saw a man who was with her, a German, give her a ticket for Liverpool, I was sure of it and seized her round the waist. She began to cry out in bad French, and struggled so that I was obliged to let her go, as I could not get any assitance, and she got Into one of the carriages. She had a parcel wrapped up in a shawl, and, as she was escapin, I spoke to the superintendent, who sent for an officer, who took her out of the carriage. The parcel in the shawl then turned out to be the portmanteau now produced. We then all got into a cab, and as she mentioned my name then, though she pretended not to know me before, I cautioned her that whatever she said I should repeat to the magistrate, She then said " I did it, and whatever punishment I et I deserve, for Mtr. Deutz did not treat me in such a way tuat I should serve him so." I asked her who the man was I had seen with her, and she re?lied "That rascal, that scoundrel, enticed me to do all this.' Mr. nAntlLE-Wher is the young man who was with her at the station ? Witness.-I don't know. I could not detain hin, as I could not get any asstance from the officials, though many were round me. They would not even let me pas from the pa office to the carriages. If they had assisted me I coud have detained him and her too, but they refused. I know the man was a German, for when she called out in French I told her that she spoke German, not French, and the man replied In German " Yes, she does speak German." The train would have started ln a quarter of an hour. Mr. EHAmrLr.-It is very extraordinary that no assistance was rendered you. Your conduct was most judicious throughout, and you deserve much praise. Are you aware of the pri r be acquaLnted with anv man? Deutz.-Yes, Sir, a German whom I knew abroa He often came to my house and was much in her company, but he has not been seen since the robbery. Hall, 264 S.-While on duty in Drummond-street I was told by a youngman that a girl was in a second-clas carriage for Liverpool who had robbed her employer, and I found the prisoner as described, with the property produced. The portmanteau was unlocked, but I took, suspended from her neck, three keys, one of which, a new one, fits the lock of the trunk. (The trunk had on it a card, with" Miss Smith, passenger " and the other side showed the key had been ought of a locksmith in Guildford-street.) In a carpet-bag she had also with her I found a pocketbook, contafiing a gold finger-ring anda passport. Inspector Weakford.-The prlsoner vwas brought last igt to the Sptalfeldsstaton in ousted, with a new carpet.bag, containing her wearing appare, and the portmanteau produced. S3he spoke German, anId I ordered a female searcher to search her. The searcher shortly after handed mne the 87 mising 20-franc pieces, a portmonnaie containing 15 sovereigns and a half, a gold ring and nockethodr and a bill for new clothing, purchased in Black. ?rars-road,'for 11. 17s. 13mma Harrls.-I searehed the prisoner and found the money on her person, tgether with a second-class railway ticket for LiverpooL Mr. Karl Konecker.-The 87 20-franc pieces are mine intrusted to the prosecutor for safety, and the pocketbook is also mine, but the portmnonnale I knowv nothine about. I deambige to go abroad directly, and hope I shl no1 b The prisoner, who had wept without ceasing throughout here said, through the interpreter, "I am guilty." Mr. HAMMILL. as the witnees could no' attend, determined to decide the case summarily, and committed the risoner to the House of Correction for six months, with nard labour. TuAs,-John Wilson, a sailors' boardinghouse-keeper, of Old Gravel-lane, St. George's-in-the-East, appeared before Mr. Sxy upn an ad'ourned summons, charged with detaning 10 in cash, a chest, wearing apparel, and other property belonging to a saUor named Frederick Larson. Lr. SELa--This is little better than a robbery. It is really scandalous. I sentence the defendant to pay a fine of 51., and also to return the money and clothes, and in default he is committed to the House of Correction for two months and tobe kept to hardlabour, Lock him up directly. SoUTwAnW .-William Harris, a well dressed, smartlooking young fellow, was brought before Mr. BuRcHA, charged with stealing a valuable watch from the person of a lady named Martha Farren at the opening of the Snow'sfields Ragged Schools. The prosecutrix stated that on the previous night she went with some friends to attend the opening of the new Ragged Schools in Snow's-fields. The meeting was presided over by the Earl of Shaftesbury. About half-past v o'look she was passing along one of the passages to get her shawl and bonnet, and at that time her watch was attached to a chain round her neck. She saw the prisoner standing in the passage, and as she ws about to pass him she heard a sDapping noise, and on looking round she saw her chain fall from the prisoner's hand, and her watch was gone. She instantly seized hold of him, and said, " You villain, you have stolen my watoh l" He replied that he had not, and attempted to get away, but a constable came up at that time, when he was ten into a room and searched, but the watch was not found on him. Mr. BuRcxr.A asked her whether there were other parties in the passage at the time ? The prosecutrix replied that there were several persons going out, and as soon as she missed her watch there was a kind of rushto the door. She had no doubt someof those persons were the prisoner's companions, to whom he had passed the watch. Mr. BuRcs asked the prisoner whether he would plead before him or go to the sessions for trial. If the former he must plead " Guilty." The prisoner pleaded " Guilty," as he did not want to go to the sessions. Mr. BuBcu here inquired what was known of him? Dennis Clark, 108 MI, stated that he was a well-known tutor of young thieves, and a short time ago he lived In a house in Bond-street, Borough-road, which was filled with them, male and female. He generaUy took them to public meetings, where they in most instances successfully committed their depredations. In April last the prisoner was sentenced to two months at Marlborough-street for a similar robbery, Mr. BuEcaAm told him he should remand him until Monday to consider what punishment he should inflict on him. However, if the watch was forthcoming in the meantime It would make some difference in the sentence, as he had pleaded guilty. LAi3Tzm-Mr. John Chisholme, a master baker, at present carrying on business at Croydon, was charged before the Hon. G. C. NORTON with committing a violent assault on Ir. Robert Martin, landlord of the Tiger publichouse, Camberwell-green. Mr. Martin said that the prisoner had been in the habit of coming occasionally to his house, but in consequence of his offensive and disgusting language he refused to serve him with anything, and requested he would keep away. On the evening before, however, he came there, and having grossly insulted a respectable customer by declaring that his wife was no better than a prostitute, and also made use of insuiting language to Mrs. Martin, witness requested he would leave his hous-s He refused to go, and as witness was about toremove him the prisoner struck him a violent blow behind the right ear with the iron instrument produced (a baker's rasp). The prisoner would have also struok him again, he had no doubt, had it not been for the presence of a constable off duty, who was having a half-pint of beer at the counter at the time. The witness added that he suffered considerably during the night, and was still suffering from the effects of the blow he had received from the pnrisoner. Police-constable WiUiam Jepson, 72 P, corroborated the testimony of the last witness, and said he took the prisoner into custody before he could strike the second blow. The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said he had purchased the rasp in the New-cut, and would not bave used it In the manner described if he had not been drinking. He therefore hoped his worship would take a lenient view of his case. Mr. NoRToN remarked that theocomplainant had a perfect right to object to serve such persons as the prisoner. The law held him responsible for the good conduct of his house, and if deprived of that right it was quite impossible he could preserve proper order in his business. It was here stated that the prisoner had been frequently in custody at this court, and twice sent from it to the Old The prisoner replied that since then he had frequently served on juries at the SurrY__eySessi_Ons, a_nd_ "rd~e ~ indenture to show that he had had apprentices bound to him with the approbation of Mr. Ellott, 3lr. NoRTOX remarked that, from the account which he had received of his conduct, he, for one, should be sorry to be a party to an apprentice being bound to the prisoner. In the present Instance he considered his conduct to be most scandalous, and the assault with which he was charged of the most uncalled-for and violent description. He then convicted him in the penalty of 31., or in default to two maonths' imprisonment, andI further called on him t-o put in bail for his good behaviour for six months. Mr. NORTON requested the acknowledgment of ol. from "A.B.C.," and 25s., post-office order, from breT.S.," for Hugll, the poor brewer.

-PRBSENTATION of OOLOURS to the 68th LIHrr INFANTRY. PORTSMOUTH, TruRsDAy. The 68th Light Infantry, upwards of 1,000 strong, under the commrand of Colonel Henry Smyth, C.B., being on the -eve of embarking for India in the steamship Australasian, from this port, were this afternoon presented with now colours on Southsea-common by his Royal Highness the Commander in-Chief. The Dake, attended by Brevet. lieutenant-Colonel T. H Clifton, aide-de-camp, and accompanied by Major-General the Hon. Sir J. Yorke Scarlett, H.C.B., cornmanding the South-west district, arrived at 11 o'clock this morning, and proceeded to the Government-house to breakfast with the Lieutenant. Governor, Major- General Scarlett. At 12 his Royal Highness was escorted to the field by his gallant host and a briliant staff, comprising Major-General Lord WilUiam Paulet, C.B., commanding the First Infantry Brigade at the Camp at Aldershott; Colonel Forster, Royal Yagineers, Aide-de-Camp to the Queen; Colonel Lake, C.B. *oemmanding the Royal Artillery ; Lieutenant-Colonel Travers, Royal Artillery; Lieutenant-Colonel Aitchison. Royal Lancashire Militia Artillery; Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, Assistant-Quartermaster-General; LieutenantColonel Conolly; Captain Gordon, Aide-de-Cam p to -General Soarlett, Town Major Breton, &sc. Admiral Sir George Seymour, X.C.B., the Naval Commander-in-Chief; Admiral the Hon. H. D. Byng, Captain Seymour, C.B., Flag Captain, and a distinguished general company were on the ground, although the day was truly a November one, and the neld sodden with the late rains. The 3d battalion of the Soots Eusileer Guards formed on the right, the 68th in the centre, and the 47th on the left of :the square, and the ground was kept by the Royal Marine Artillery. The old colours of the regiment were dressed in laurels in commemoration of Inkermann-day. The Commander-in-Chief was received In open Equare with the general salute, and the square having been extended the lRev. E. W. Milner, garrison chaplain, advauced to the colours and invoked a blessing upon them. His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief then advanced on horseback and gave the colours into the hands of Lientenant-Colonel Blount and Mejor Greer, who delivered them over to Lieutenants Grace and De Saunderson. They were Inscribed with the names of " Salamanca,"' "Vittoria," "Pyrenees," " NiveUe," "OOrthew," " Peninsula," "Alma," 'Inkermann," " Sebastopol." The DuXE then addressed the regiment as foUows'Officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the X6th Light Infantry,-I have much pleasure in presenting new colours to a regiment which pon all occasions has dis tinguished itself whenever brought into action. During the Peninsular War no regiment suffered more, or porformed its duties more creditably. Again, in a recent contest which has now become matter of history, on this very day three years ago, I. myself, had a opportunity of zeeing the distinguisbed gallantry of the 68th. I am persuaded that the same spirit animates the regiment still, and that whenever caUed upon to meet an enemy in the field it will exhibit the same energy and courage wLhich it displayed at the battle of Inkermann. It is a satisfaction to me to see the regiment go out under the commnand of an officer in whom I have the greatest confidenee, T regret that you should be again caUed upon to leave your native shores after so short a sojourn at home, but the British soldier is always ready to go anywhere and do anything for the honour and glory of his country, and I am sure you will embark as cheerfully for the distant shores of India as no doubt you disembarked when you returned from ,the Crimea. You are going to a distant part of the world, but I hope you will not relax those strict rules of discpline which so distinguish you whilo at home. You -Lave my best wishes. I have participated with you in the achievement of great victories, and I hope to hear of your prosperity wherever Her Majesty and the country may require your services." Colonel SMYTII then made a suitable reply on behalf of the regiment, after which the troops on the field went through the evolutions incidental to au official inspection. Mis -Royal Hghness afterwards inspected the lines and the new barracks at the top of tho town, named after himself, and which wiU shortly be occupied. He left Portsmouth by the 4.1.5 p.m. train for London. The proceedings of the day closed with a banquet given by Colonel Smyth and the officers of the 68th to the principal personages connected with the garrison, port, and district.
TVE PATRIOTIC FtrND.-Sir John Pakinoton in a letter, dated Mlonday last, and addressed to a 'Worcester. shire newspaper, has sought to vindicate the administration of the Patriotic Fund, which was assailed at the recent county meeting at Worcester, held for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny, by Mr. Acton, a Roman Catholio gentleman. "5The acousation (says Sir John) is that the noblemen and gentlemen whom it pleased the Queen to associate with the Prince Consort for the admi. rmistration of a noble public charity have abused their trust, violated their duty, and disregarded the most obvious dic. tates of honour; and that their motive for so acting has been the hope of converting to Protestantism some few dozen ,voor Roman Catholie children of soldiers and sailors who mced in the service of their country during the late war with Russia, As this charge has been seriously made, I suppose I must seriously notice it, though I -onfess it seems to be so extravagant that I find It 4difficult to treat it with gravity. But the facts are more important than the imputed motive. Mr. Acton refers to the Commissioners having paid eertain sums to the Wel- ington College School, to the Royal Naval SchooL and to several other similar Institutions casnected with the army and navy to enable us to send to them a given number of Orphaus; and he then adds, 'I ow much has been given to any one Catholic institution ? Not one shilling.' The answer is that there are no Roman Catholic institutions of this description. Mr. Acton complains that 'The Sisters Of Mercy of St. 4lare and other religious communities in D)ublin offered their services, at small expense, for the education of female orphans, and yet their services were refused.' Their service were not refused; Mr. Acton has been altogether mfisinfonined upon this point. Mr. Acton states thiat 700 elilidren are under insBtruction, supported by the fund, and then asks, ' If these children are Protestants, where are the Catholeise' These words :uggest an inference, and are therefore not so easy todeal with distinctly as specific allegations. I sup. pose Mr. Acton to allude to the fact that there are about 700 children in Protestant asylums, and only 25 in Roman Catholic asylums. The answer is that the number of children In asylums depends very much upon the mothers, with whom has been left the right to choose - ndeed, there is no power vested in the Commissioners to deprive them of that right. There are few children from Ireland in asylums, for two reasons; first, food is cheap, and the mothers prefer keeping their children at home and receiving the allowance. This operates equally in Scotland, where there are only 20 in asylums; and we find the same inclination in England when the mothers have the means of supporting their children; second, there are very few children above the age of seven in Ireland or In Scotland, or indeed among the line regiments generally. There onlv remains Mlr. Acton's compnlant that the admission of three toys to one of the Roman Catholic establishments was de,ayed b:y 12 months' correspondenee, 'and alL sorts of frivo. lous objections.' Tne explanation Is that we have always t.hought it our duty to reserve the right of inspecting schoo,s tO which we sent children. This wa;s acceded to by the princpal of that establishment, but he stated that the school was about topass into other hands, and he could not answer for them. Under these circumstances we delayed =ntil we obtained an agreement to these conditi9cm from the lay brothers, who have since taken charge of the whool, It rests with the mothers to direct what the religious teach. ing of their children shall be. I trust I have said enou h to show that the suspioions entertained by the Roman Catholec body do not rest upon any reasonable foundation. In dealing with so Lsrge a number of applicants accidental errors may have occurred; If so, let them be correoted, but of intenionl unfaness therehas been none, and I submit thaLt It in now inctumbent upon Archbishop Cullen and others who havebrotught forwvard these opprobrious charges eitbor
-E-TROPOLITA N BOARD3 OF TORKS. CON 0ETALE eE co,, F,-ENEWITEH SIR 4"NIJA\IIN RALL. ON T B_ AIN DRAINAVroE('P L xgvm---- TheJU1 MetroPolitan Board of Wormited ~ Aa caled pan Bto he First Commissionier of Her M[ajesty's WorksB Pact Buildings for the main drainage of the roolis. This plan was rejected, on the ground that It did no' fulfi the requirements of the Act of Parliament. A seco"d plan, caged plan B ', was then prepared, =nd laid before the Commissione% by whom it was ref erred to Captain 330ugla Galton, 'ILR., lr. James Simpson, C.E., and Mr. T. B. Blackwel, G1E., for consideration. These gentlemen made t'eir report on the 3lst of July last, in which they recommended a system of drainage varying in many moaterial respects frem that proposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, a involving nxumerous modifications of that plan. The ILetropolitan Board came to a resolution resecting the plan of the Government engineers, and on Eriday last addressed a letter to Sir B. Hal, in which they assigned their reasons for so doing, and at the same time requested an interview with him en the subject. A conference was accordingly held yesterday at the office of the Board of Works, Whitehall.place, between Sir Benja-rin Hall, the First Commissioner (who was assisted by Captain D. Galton and MIr. Simpson), and Mr. Thwaltes, the chairman of the Metropolitan Board, accompanied by Mr. Woolrych, the clerk, and Mr. Basalgette, the engineer of the board. Mr. TiwAiTEis.-Thls,.Sir'Benjamin, wil be the third time I have had the honour of appearing 'before you on the all-important subject of the main drainage of the metropolis. It is now within a few days of a twelvemonth ago that 1 presented to you plan B*. That plan has been referred by you to three gentlemen of the highest eminence and respectability. The delay that has arisen out of that reference is a matter which the Metropolitan Board of Works deeply regret. I am not about to blame you for having so referred that plan; probably it was the course whioh aay person under similar circumstances would have adopted. Neither am I prepared to blame the referees for the time taken by them for the consideration of this important subject. Indeed, they have acknowledged in their report -that so vast has been the question that the time occupied by ,them (being somewhat about nine months) has been insufficient to enable them carefully to master all the details and difficulties of the matter. No doubt, the referees found that the more they investigated the subject the more it was beset with difficulties which did not appear on the surface. Without making any further prefatory remarks I beg to express a hope that the result of the present conference will be to rescue the question from aU engineering conflicts on the one hand, and from fierce personal and private jealousies on the other. I trust that we shall be able to bring to bear on the subjeet such an amount of common sense and practical knowledge as shall result in relieving the inhabitants of London of those evils aristng from an imper feet and an Impure state of drainage from which they have been suffering for so many years. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to caU the attention of Sir Benjamin Hall to the reasons which had induced the Metropolitan Board to refuse the adoption of the plan proposed by the Government engineers. One very serious obh Jectlon was the proposed increased area which the plan of those gentlemen comprehended. Upon that subject, probably, it was only necessary for him to refer to the fact that upon Sir Benjamin's own motion Parliament had but recently fixed the extent of area to be dealt with by the Board of Works, and there might probably at this period be some difficulty in extending that area. But there were other objections to an extension of the area, to which he begged to call especial attention. The area under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board comprised 1172 square miles. The area with which the Government referees pro. posed that the Board should have to deal would comprise 354 square miles; the drainage of alarge portion of the additional distriets being simply that of the rainfalls, the ordinary manure of those districts being applied to agricultural purposes. But what would be the consequence to the ratepayers of thus increasing the area ? It would be necessary to increase the size of the sewers some three or four times in capacity ; while for the greater portion of the year, owing to that increased size, the sewage would be running in mere driblets, the result of which would be a vast deposit, and an inefficienoy in the general action of the sewer altogether opposed to those hydraulic prinoiples which guided engineers in the contruction of such works. The deposit in the sewers of London was a veryimportant question. It involved an annual expense of 26,0001. to remove the deposit which remained stagnant in the present sewers. The object both of Parliament and of the Board must be so to construct the sewers as to insure a sufficient scouring power to relieve the districts that were suffering from these deposits. If the extended area were adopted the tunnels would be so enlarged as greatly to increase the difficulties which the Board would have to contend with in other respects. The sewers to bo constructed would be of such an enormous size as to be almost impracticable in the streets of London. Another point adverted to by thhe covernment engineers had engaged his attention. They stated that one cubic foot of sewage mixed with five times its bulk would become innoxious. They, indeed, laid this down as a principle-he might almost call it their formula, by which they regulated all their proceedings, for he found that their main deductions were founded on that proportion. It was impossible,. as no doubt the referees had themselves aacertained, to carry off the whole of the rainwater during the entire year, and the plan of the Board made that admlssion; but with the view of preventing an overflow of water into the Thames for some ten days in the year these gentlemen proposed additional sewers, or rather sewers of an additional size, Involving a fHghtful expense of money. And why should aU this be. What would be the proportion of the sewage to the rainwater when the channels were surcharged and the contents passed over into the Thames? Takin, very various condition of the sewage, he found that that which would pass over the tunnel into the Thames would be in the proportion of 7} cubic feet of water to one of sewage. This was a larger dlution than that which the referces stated would be necessary in their own opinion to be obtained; therefore one would logicaUy arrive at the conclusiou that to increase the sels of these sewers for the purpose of preventing during a few days in the year this diuted sewage from flowing Into the Thames was altogether unnecessary. The referees did not themselves propose the introduction of a large stream of water which would effoetually carry eff aU the sewage throughout the whole year. They admitted that during certain days in the year some portion of the sewage must pass over into the Thames, and yet to effect so small an object they proposed a plan that would involve a most disproportionate expenditure. He would now call Sir B. Hall's attention to the proposition for the construction of open sewers. The Metropolitan Local Management Act expressly provided that the Board should not construct way works so as to become a nuisance. It had hitherto been the policy of the Board and of all preceding Commissions to abolish all open sewers; but the referees appeared to be of opinion that by a mixture of five parts water and one part sewage the evil effeots generated by the impure gases arising from open sewers would be destroyed, or, in other words, that a constant flow would prevent those consequences which would arise from a more stagnant pooL The time that would be occupied in discharging the sewage at the outfall, and the time required for decomposition of the sewage by the action of the atmosphere, were questions he would not enter upon then; but he apprehended that Sir B. Hall could not fail to arrive at the same conclusion the Board itself had arrived at, that open sewers ware entirely inadmissible, and that it was a proposition which could never be sanctioned. After some technical criticisms as to the practicabitty of constructing these elongated open sewers, and as to the admission of water into them for the purpose of carrying off the sewage, he stated that the Board were apprehensive that to effect the object proposed by the referees the navigation of the river itself would be greatly prejudiced, and that in order to have a quantity of water equal to the ordinary flow of the channels it would require the construction of reservoirs that would occupy no less than 460 acres of land, an area equal to that of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens together. He need nob say that any schemaerequlring such a work in order to keep up the proposed .lisoharging power was altogether inadmissible. The mechanical power that would be required to lift the water from the Thames into these channels would be attended with an annual cost of 36,uOOI.-a most onerous burden on the ratepayers of London, and one which demanded the most serious consideration of the First Commissioner before giving his sanction to any such plan. The next point to which he begged to call attention was the proposed extension of the outfall. That had been already the subject of conference. On the 20th of November last year a deputation presented to Sir B. Hall the plan B with a star, and it was accompanied with a resolution passed by the Board, declaring their readiness to carry out any extension of their own plan if the Government wished it to be done and were willing to assist in providing funds for that purpose. On that occasion a member of the deputation asked whether they ware to understand that the plan indicated in Captain Burstall's letter as to the points of outfall wvas satisfactory to the First Commissioner, wheniSir Benjamin Hal said he did not think ho should be justified in goin beyond those points, because if he did he should be assking them to expend money fo. purposes other than were considered by the Legislature necessary for the metropolis. That declaration on the part of the First Commissioner, If carried out, would relieve the Board from many difficulties in regard to the outfall. The Boardl was qulite willing that the outfall should be extended to Sea Reach. He was prepared to admit that the point fixed upon by the Board was not so good as that indicated by the referees. He considered that their reasons were sufficient and conclusive. The Board was quite willing, therefore, to extend the outfall to Sea Beach, provided that the ratepayers of the metropolis should not be required to pay the excpenses of that extension. hut thatt tnose expenses should he provided for out of tbe national fund, as suggested by the First Commissioner at the con- ference on the 20th of November last year. Sir BENLJAMIN HLL5.L-I did not say the expenses shouild be defrayed out of the national fund. . Mr. TUNVAITES.-Well, I am careless as to the fund out of 'which the money comes, so that the ratepayers are not burdened with the charge. Sir B. HALL.-I never said anything as to the manner in which the money was to be raised, either directly or indirectly, e.ietyo Mr. TsHArTEs.-I understoed that the additional expense should be provided for out of the national resources. Sir B. HAUL.-I wish you distinctly to understand that I never had a glimmering of such an idea in mY imagination, or that I said anything that could posifbly lead any person to such a conclusion, I never in the slightest degree, directly or indirectly, indicated that ihe Government would advance a penny, or that Parliament would sanction any advance. Air. TInWAITES1 said it was niot at all necessary for his purpose to dispute the question, The cost for extending the outfal from B*to Sea Beach was estimated at 1,500,0001. It would hardly be just to impose a tax upon the rate. payers of the metropolis to pay that additional charge. The referees had considered what districts ought to be taxed in aid of the ratepa%yers of the metropolis, and from the deo(s given by those 'gentlemen he found that the districts, including persons residing 10 miles from the sewers, would have to contribute 3 per cent. of 1.50,0001. towards the additional outlay of 1,500,0001. Would so insigni. ficant a contribution be an e nuivalent for the exten. sion of the outfadll? He thouI 'te referees would op Jgsw ira that it would be better fur the Board at once to present aiosc districts with ths 150,0001., sad permit the to *earry oat a sealed sewer of 'their o0n, instead of acceptIng so inadequate a contribation. Atter all, the whole matter turaed entirely upon a questin of finance. It had 'bcen asked why were the metropolitan represeatatives so tenacious on the matter of tavotiou as not to be prepared so take the sewage down to a onoft of outfall which it vss desirable shouldlbe adopted ? N must be remembered tkat when the Board of Works was formed the fends for ca'tytng out the drainage of the metropolis were exhausted, acid -Parliament had come to a decision that no further grants should be made for Parliamentary improvemedts, but that the metropolis most take care of itself. The Board was called into existence to face am irnmense -debt which was left to them as a legacy by their predonessors. As a municipal body they were denied every.power which a merely provincial corporation possessed forthe improvement of their town. Liverpool was a case qut%e analogous to that of the metropolis. he corporation of Liverpool had constructed magnilicent docks and had made other improvements, not by possessing the power of dire-t taxation, but by an indirect mode of taxation-namely, by the levylng of dues upon the shipping passing and enteming that port, and by other means. Bab in London there were no such resources Although they had omnibuses and cabs tearing up their streets any tax imposed upon those vehicles found its way into the public exchequer, and not into the hands of the Metropolitaa Board of Wo-ks. If there were coal dues, they were absorbed by carrying out improvements in an area consisting of one square mlle, and were not extended to improvements in anarea af 117 square miles. Many other towns and cities had the mneans of taxing themselves or possessed property from which they derived a revenue applicable to local improvements. The members of the Metropolitan Board of Works not having these means were not disposed to plunge altogether into any expensive undertakings unless they saw that a valuable consideration would be derived from them for the ratepayers of the metropolis. He repeated, therefore, thst if Sir Benjamin Hall was of opinion that the outfaUls should not be at B*y but should be extended to Sea Reach, the BEard were ready to carry out that plan provided the funds were forthcomina. But from what source they were to come he would leave it for the right hon. baronet to explain. The Board had a right to ask that they might be supplied with the means for carrying out these improvements% They were unable to make brickswithout straw. It was idle for thepublic orfor Sir B. Hall to expect the Board to carry out these enormous works while funds were withheld from them. For the considerations he had thus laid before him he hoped the right hon. gentleman would not require an extension of the area laid down by Parliament, and would not sanction any scheme which did not confine itself to the metropolitan area. In reference to open channels he ventured to esy that Sir Benjamin Hall would scarcely endorse the construction of works which upon the very face of them it must be obvious would be most injurious to the public health; and, lastly, as to the extension of the outfalls, that was a question he left with confidence in the hands of Sir Benjamin; and begged in conclusion to say that every member of the Metropolitan Board felt an anxiety for the speedy settlement of this important question; and he hoped that by means of this conference it would be so reheved from the difficulties with which it had hitherto been beset, and would be brought into such a shane by the friendly conference of the engineers, as to determine what the area should be, and whether the point of discharge should be at B* or Sea Beach. Tkese were engineerin points on which he had no doubt the referees and the engineer of the Board would come to a satisfactory conclusion. We come to you (said Mr. Thwaites) In the best spirit, and we feel the utmost confidence that you are disposed to meet us in the same spirit, and that you are as anxious as we are to bring this most important matter to a close; and I trust that means will be placed at our disposal by which we may bce enabled to carry out this gigantic work to a satisfactory concluson. Sir B. HALL.-I quite agree with you that it would be desirable that this matter, which has been under consideration for so long a period of time, should be settled and brought to a close as soon as possible. But after the observations you have mLde it may be convenient that I should state what has taken place. On the 23d of December I received your plan, and on the 31st of that month, notwithstanding the holydays, I placed the plan in the hands of the referees. On the 31st of July they made their report, a copy of which I transmitted to you on the same day. Therefore, as far as thia department is concerned, not one day has been lost in the consideration of this important matter. I hope and believe that the conference this day will lead to a satisfactory conelosion. I will now refer to the three objections to the plan of the referees to which you have called my attention. You say that the metropolitan area comprises 117 square miles; but that the referees, with a view to the main drainage, have comprised within their area not less than 354 square miles; and you say that this involves an increased size of sewers three or four times greater than is necessary if the mam drainage be confined to the metropoLitan area. My object when I proposed the Act of Parliament was the purification of the river Thames by cleansing it from all the impurities that may from any source run into the river, and I consider that It is your duty to carry out that provision of the Act. I don't wish you to do more. But then you may say that the referees have included a larger number of square miles in their plan than is proposed by yours. So they have, and why? The reason is that a great dealof drainlae comes downfromfar off districts into the Tnames, which'is within your area. Now, I think it is the duty of your Board to intercept all impurities thab flow into the Thames within the area of the district under your control and supervision. As thismay be amatter for the referees to consider, Ithink you would do well to appoint one or two members of your Board, with your engineer, to confer with the referees. Ur. TNvArTES.-If I understand you correctly you require us to intercept the drainage coming from places eyond the metropolitan district. Sir B. HALL.-This is a very important point, and I should be sorry that any misunderstanding should arise respecting it. Take, for instance, any stream, call it stream A that faUs into the Thames within the metropolitan area, I conceive that if there is any impurity in that stream which renders the Thames pestilential it ought to be intorcetted. Mr. TxwArris.-Then all contributory streams to the Thames must be intercepted, for thereis scarcely any stream which, strictly speaking, can be said to be free from impurity. But in many cases you would have no tidal stream at all, and the navigation of the river wodLd be destroyed, as it would be ileft without water. What the Board are required to do is to remove any impurities that are created within the metrorolitan boundary, and intercept any nuisances within that area. After this point had been very fully diseussed, Sir B. HALL observed that It was more a matter for the consideration of the engineers than for him to enter upon, and repeated that his intention and the intention of the Legislature was, that the Thames should be cleansed from all impurities that flowed into it within the metropolitan area, and it would be the duty of the Board to provide means for that purpose. He quite agreed with the Board that there should be no open sewers. Mr. TarvES.-What do you mean ? Sir B. HALL said he thought it extremely desirable that all channels for the sewers should be covered. Then, with regard to the outfalls, he was quite ready to admit that if the outfalls were made according to plan B*, it would meet the immediate requirements of the metropolis- but what would be the consequence if he were to sanction that plan ? His impression was that if they were to stop at B* they would incur many risks, by which the provisions of the Act would,be violated, and it wasfor the Board to consider whether they would run those risks. The more the question was gone into the more did it become the feeling of the public that the point of discharge should be much lower down the river than at B*, and he thought the point selected by the referees was the best point of discharge that could be determined upon. Then, with respect to the funds necessary for meeting the extra expense that would be incurred by carrying the olnt of discharge down to Sea Reach, he repeated that he tad never said one word as to Government advancing a sigle farthing towards the work. Even if Goverament entertained such an idea he was perfectly certain Parlianment would never sanction it. He did not agree with Mr. Thwaites that the whole matter turned upon a question of finance. This was a great work intrusted to the Metropolitan Board-a work that would last for ages and generations to come, and ought to be carried out in the best, the most generous, and the moat liberal spirit. No doubt, every consideration ought to be given as to effecting the work with a proper eeonomy, but at the same time, he would repeat, the views of the Legislature ought to be carried out in a liberal spirit, and sovastaworkoughttobe accomplished without too minute a regard for expense. It was said that the metropo. lis was placed in a different position from that of other towns, and Liverpool had been referred to; but Liverpool was an exceptional ease. It had old charters of incorporation under which the borough had the power of taxing the whole world. The shipping dues were very great and were extended over the shipping of all countries. The proceeds of those dues and other powers possessed by the corporation were so great that they were able to effect large improvements in the town of LiverpooL But that was not the case with other towns. Manchester had but recently received municipal powers, and yet no town In England had improved so rapidlv as Manchester The onlyv source of revenue, however. which Ntnhse possessesdwas a Gas Company, the proceeds of whichvwere not very large. But supposing they were it only proved that the inhabitants were taxed by means of paying for gas that which they would otherwise have to pay in the shape of a rate. Many improvements had been effected in Manchester out of funds paid by the people of that town; he thought, therefore, that the metropolis was placed on preelsely the same footing as Manchester. Mr. TMVAITr S said London had been for many years neglected, there being no governing rower whose duty it was to carry out improvements; a large amount of arrears had I therefore accumulated, and the Board had now to grapple with the burden by means of an increased direct taxation, instead of by a slower and an indirect mode of taxation. Sir B. HALL said the metropolis was precisely on the same footing as Manchester was before it received municipal power. They had no funds whatever to draw upon except the rates. Mr. THWAITES.-BUt we have to provide for a very large aimount of Government property which does not pay one shilling in rates. Sir B. HAIL.-But if the Crown does not pay rates, It pays by way of contribution under protest a sum equal to the rates, with the exception of the Royal pala s aud the Rouses of Parliament. Viewing the whole as a quesion of finance, it was to be considered what would be the amount imposed upon the ratepayers. The rateable value of the metropols was at the present time, in round numbers, 12,000,0oo. sterling. There was every reason to believe, looldng at the past and what would certainly happen, that the area would increase, and the amount of property over which the Board would have the power of levying rates would consequently also materially increase. But, taking the value at 12,000,0001., and assuming that the Board were required to expend 5,000,0001. sterling, the question w DS what woulid be the amount thrown upon the ratepayer for carrying out those great works which Parliament had delegated to the Board. Supposing the Board had no Mgagns of getting the money exept upon the security of the rates; SUpposing that no guarantee should be given by the Government or Parliament to enable the Board to raise the maoney, the probability was that they would net ee able to obtain it at less than 6 per cent. interest. Nw,/, if the Board raised 5,000,0001. at5 per cent. for 50 years, it would require a rate to be levied to ths amount of 273,M. per annum. That sumdistribnted over - ., 001. Seerling would require a rate of less than 65,-It beieg 5d. and onefarthingand 9-lOths. If the nsoncy were obtained at 4.1 per cenrt it would renuire a rate to be levied amounting to 253,0101., which wod make the I rate less than 5.d. ; and if the money were had at 4 per cent. the annual sum required would be 232,7511., making the rate 4.d. in tho pound. Therefore, although this was a very great work, and would require a large sum to carry it out, yet it would cost the ratepayers not more than 5.d. in the pound. He would ask was that suok an enormous charge that they ought to be detarred from proceeding with the work on the best and most comprehensive manner. Mr. THAmTES said the amount certainly did not sound very large, but it must be borne in mind tbat, this was in reference to one work only, rnd world form only ono part of their expenditure. There were the expenses of the dstrict boards and of the local drainages to be added, t and he was quite sure he was addressing gentlemen suff- ciently acquamted with the monetary world to know that it would be an impossibility for the Board to go into the money-market and raise 5,000,000& of money without the aid of the Government. Sir B. HALL.-That is another question. I am not pealung of the mode in which the money should be raisedI am only speaking of the amount of the money required F or carrying out this great work, and the question is whether you will refuse to carry the outfall down to Sea Reach for the sake of saving a rate of 5id. in the pound. Mr. TawArEBq.-Am I to understand that in your opinion the outfal ought to be at Sea Reach ? Siz B. IIALTL.-Yes. I Mr. THwAiT1s said it was impossible to doubt that Sea Reach was the best outfall, but then it was said the metropolis ou-ht to be charged with it, while the Board was thorougl2y convinced that it ought not. Was it the opinion of Sir Benjamin that Parliament would not contribute towards the expense? Sir B. HALL.-Yes. Mr. THviTms-Then there is an end; and we are to expend 1,500,0001. more money than is required by the wants of the metropolis. Sir B. HMA said, in answer to a question, that he was not prepared to say whether the Government would afford its aid by way of guarantee to the Board in raising money on more easy terms than it otherwise could do. It was a matter which rested entirely with the Chancelior of the Exchequer. If the Metropolitan Boad thought proper to wait upon that gentleman he (Sir B. Hall) would be happy to attend any meeting and hear what the Chancellor of the Exchequer might say on the subject. He was very glad they had had this conference. He hoped and believed it would lead to beneficial results. The question was what course they were now to pursue. t The referees had submitted to him a plan. He was not wedded to that plan at all. If it could be shown that there were fallacies in it, or any errors, he was suze that the referees themselves would immediately correct them. The only object they had in view was to devise a final and comprehensive scheme suitable to the purpose, and then to carry it out. The best course therefore would be for the Metropolitan Board to appoint two members of their Board assiing themselves with their own engineer to meet the referees, and he was quite sure they would enter into the whole matter in a good t, and would be able to arrive ;at some conclusIon which might be satisfactory to all The deputation then withdrew.
