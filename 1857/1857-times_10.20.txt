NONEY-MARK.Tand CITYINTBLLIGENCZE Monday Evening. TheBank of Fngland have to-day raised their ra'e of discount from 7 per cent., which was adopted on Monday last, to 8 per cent. This step is solely in consequence of the American eows. According to the latest dates, the rate of - xchange even for the best bills had fallen to a point 'which would give a very large profit on gold from Englaud, and, although, owing to the possibility of ;a sudden rebound, speculators on this side might -lesitate to undertake the operation to a heavy extent, the amount of bills tranamitted from New York, with direct orders for returns to be made in specie, coupled with the sums being despatehed by our capitalists for the purchase of securities, involve the certainty of a further drain, against which the most prompt precautions were requisite. The public were aware that the question of an advance to 8 per cent. would depend entirely upon these advices, and if the Ariel had arrived at her expected time the maovement would doubtless have been adopted three -or four days back, since the later accounts, brought vi0 Boston, are scarcely eso bad as those with which she started. The rate now reached is equal to the highest known in modern times, and -our only experience of it was for four weeks from the 25th of October, 1847, when the railway panic -attained its climax, and Consols were down at 80, the Bank bullion having been reduced to 8,312,0001. and the reserve to 1,547,0001. In the present in' stance it is unlikely that the pressure will last even to long as four weeks, but, as our condition must -dpend upon the course of the American disorder, -and it is impossible to conjecture what may be the next turn of frenzy, we must hold ourselves prepared for all contingencies. According to the accounts to-day everything had been brought to a dead lock. Debts could not be paid between distant cities because there were no safe means of remitlance, and produce ready to be converted into gold could not be forwarded to port, owing to the absence -of any power of obtaining advances upon it. Every -one saw that if the machinery of ordinary custom -could again be set in motion all would instantly be righted ; but in no quarter was there power to bring about such a result. Whether escape would be found through some final convlsion, or through a slow and fluctuating convalesence, no one could pre-dict, but it was certain that, matters could not continue long in their then state. Among the con-aiderations on the favourable side was the fact .that the stock of specie in the New York banks still stood at 2,28C,0001., which is be.yond its average amount, and more than 500,0001. in excess of the total held at the corresponding teriod of last year, while their note circulation wa3 less than at that time. The Californian arrivals of about 250,0001. each fortnight would also be -retained, and in less than a week the Vanderbilt would be due from Havre with, it was believed, 200,0001., to be followed shortly by the 320,0001. lately despatched from London and LiverpooL Against these prospects the only alarming point is the poswibility of the run upon the banks for hoarding purposes, which had already atsumed disagreeable proportions, becoming altogether ungovernable. Meanwhile, as regards our own position, in all those branches of trade not connected with America there is a total freedom from uneasiness. The circumstance merely of an advance in the rate of -discount to 8 per cent. for a fewr weeks to meet a temporary evil in which all other nations participate can inspire no dread on the part of any solvent houses. The difference bet'reen that and 5 per cent. -even for two months would amount only to an extra 10s. per cent. on all the accommodaiAonr they might reauire, and if their eapital and current profits are inadequate for such a contingency they can scarcely be considered fit to be in business at all on their -own account. Of course, there are cases where, owing to heavy contracts having been entered into, or other similar causes, the effect may be peculiarly severe, but these are altoegther exceptional. As a general rule, there ought among a sound mer-cantile community to be no terrors in 8 per cent., or any other rate of discount, supposing it not to have been occasioned by a reckless course of national extravagance, and hence there is reason to believe that the announcement of to-day will be received throughout the country, as it has been in the metropolis, without the slightest ineication of confusion *or alarm. The funds opened this morning at a decline of a half per cent., in consequence of the impression that the American advices would increase the drain of specie, and the speculators generally were disposed to press sales. Most of the brokers, however, were still buyers on behalf of the public, and a recovery took place until about half-past 2 in the afternoon, vwhen the resolution of the Bank was notified in the Stock-Exchange, and a faU oc-curred to an eighth below the opening prices, from which there was no recovery. The first trans-actions in Consols were at 88# to i, whence they rapidly advanced to 88i. They then went to 88 to i, which was the last official quotation, and after regular hours there were sellers at 88. For the 10th of November the final price was 88k to i. :Bank Stock left off at 212 to 213k-; Reduced, -87k to -; Neow Three per Cents., 87i to i; India Stock, 20, to 209; India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 9s. to 5s. discount. Money was abundant in the Stock-Exchange at the commencement of business, and loans on Government securities were obtainable at 5 per cent. Ultimately the charge was 5i to 6. At the Bank, in the course of the morning, there was a very active pressure, many persons anticipating that the New York intelligence would be followed by a speedy advance of the rate. The supply thus obtained seemed to be beyond any actual requiremaents, and at the end of the day the balances in -the hands of the banks and discount houses were 7arge. About 60,0001. of tnegold bytheRoyal Charterwas Rold to the Bank to-day. It is said a larger proportion would have been taken there if the rate of dis-count had been raised at an earlier hour, but when the announcement was made the greater part had been sold for the Continent. The amount of gold likely to be sent to New York by the Arago, from Southampton on Wednesdav, has not been ascertained. It will probably consist of sovereigns. The discount houses have increased their rate -of allowance to 7 per cent. for money at call, and 7i for depoeits with short notice, being an advance zo one per cent. The National Discount Company have notified that their terms are respectively 7* and 7i per cent. The rate of the joint-stock banks for deposits will be 7 per cent. Foreign stocks have been heavy, and nearly all the transactions were at a reduction. In Turkish, -especially, a fall occurred of nearly 1 per cent. Brazilian Five per Cents. wese negotiated at 100 and 994; Chilian Six per Cents., 102; Danish Five per Cents., 100X; Mexican, 19i; Peruvian Four- nd-a-HJalf per Cents., for the account, 77, 76, and 177; ditto Three per Cents., 53i and 52i; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 954; Sardinian, for account, 89; Turkish Six per Cents., 87a, J, ancd j; for the account, 8Q, 87Q, 86i, and 87; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 97;; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents. 634; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 974, 4, and 97. The corn-market showred increased heaviness this morning, and it was difficult to effect sales at a de,line of 2s The final quotations of the French Three perCents. don the Pars Bourse this evening were 66f. 85c. for money and 66L 80c. for the end of the month, -ahowing a decline of a'oout three-eighths per cent. Moet probably the movement made by the Bank on ibis sde did not tanpire before the close of busi- es. It is assumed that the Bank of Franco will i.fsel cpelled imediately to fellorw the example. The suspension wa announced to-day of M esar Asid and~ Buch~nsn, of Glasgow merchant5 asyd shippers. Their liaoilities, which are estimated at 100,0001., are believed to be chiefly locaL At Hamburg the rate of discount has advanced to 9i per cent. The Vienna letters mention the stoppage of Messrs. Malanotti and Co. for 40,0001. The list of additional failures from New York comprises several houses of first-rate standing. Among these are Clark, Dodge, and Co., bankersWillits and Co., importers of hardware and whale oil, reported a few weeks back to be worth 200,0001.; P. Chouteau, jun., and Co., merchants; and Hutchinson, Ziffana, and Co., warehousemen. Bowen, McNaniee, and Co., silk importers, were likewise in good credit. At Pbiladelphia one of the largest was that of Levy and Co., importers of manufactured goods; and at Boston Messrs. Lavrrence,Stone, and Co., extensive factory owners. It is till observablo that a large proportion of the general suspensions consist of manufacturing firms, and it may be inferred, therefore, that in numerous cases the event has been brought about by the inability of those who had been upheld by the old protective system to encounter the recent reduction of the tariff. The number of persons thrown out of employ would be enormous, and there was a prospect of severe distress during the approaching winter. At Philadelphia the diqcount on the inconvertible circulation was still not more than 5 per cent., but this quotation applies to silver coinage, the discount as compared with gold being apparently 7 to 10 per cent. In the New York Stock-market the daily fluctuations in most of the principal railway securities has been equal to 20 per cent.; sometimes the range has been nearly to that extent between two consecutive transactions. Erie had touched 9i, but closed at I11 ; Panama had gone from 50, its lowest price, to 63 ; Illinois Central, from 75 to 84; New York Central, from 60 to 554; and Reading, from 25k, to which it had fallen upon some of its bills being protested, to 304. At one moment the stook is said to have been offered at Philadelphia at 12. Michigan Southern had declined to 11, and remained -without recovery. The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week are much less uneatisfactory than might have been expected. It must be assumed, however, that throughout the remainder of tie year the amount of our exports will be considerably reduced by the cessation of the American demand. Of course, the varioua houses on this side desire to say as little as possible of their Iosses, but hitherto the actual mischief seems not to have been of dangerous extent,thesteady conduct of our principalfirms having kept them in a position to meet any temporary inconvenience. At Manchester the failures, although numerous, have been entirely limited to secondary establishments, and the large suspensions at Glasgow are believed chiefly to have comprised houses long notorious for trading beyond their means. At Birmingham it is said no severe injury has thus far been inflicted, while from Leeds we have the remarkable statement that 1,0001. would cover all the liabilities that have yet arisen in connexion with the New York diasters. It can scarcely be hoped that these instances of immunity will continue, and there is little doubt that the aggregate of debts due to England from failed houses in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and 3altimore is enormous, although from the manner in which they are spread, and the stability of those upon whom they have fallen, the publio in a majority of cases will probably be spared a knowledge of them. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been little alteration. The number of ships reported inward was 223, being 11 more than in the previous -week. The number cleared outward was 124, including 15 in ballast, showing an increase of 15. The Board of Customs have granted the privileges of bonding tea to warehouses in the occupation of Messrs. Joseph Barber and Co., of Brewer's-quay, adjoining the Blackwall lailway. It appears that the India mail, vid Marseilles, oonsisting of 33 boxes, was conveyed from Paris to London in a little over eight hours on Thursday last, vid Boulogne and Dover, by special trains and steamer. This is the quickest transmission of a mail that has ever been efiected from Paris to London. The Fairy has arrived from China with 604,5001b. of tea. The following is from the Port Philip and Colonial Gold Company:- "Advices have been recelved from the resident director, dated Melbourne, August 12. Considerable improvement had taken place in the business of quartz-crashing at Chines. The stamps and the Chilian mill were working more effciently than hitherto, and the yield of the quartz was in. oreasing. The machinery then In operation was a stamping mill o' 20 heads and one Chilian milL Mir. Bland was prooeeding with the erection of an additions stamping mim of 12 heads and another Chilian mill, seeing encouragement In the progress hitberto made. The details of the proceedings since the last mail are coming by the Australian Overland Mail, the foregoing intelligence having been received by the Royal Charter." And the following is from the United AIea*an:" Advices have been received from Guanaxuato, dated the 14th of September. The amount of extraction from the mine of Jesus Maria y Jose during the three weeks had been 2,450 carga.,-a somewhat less average, attributable to circumstances unconnected with the capabilities of the mine. The repairs and timbering of the shaft having been completed, the resinking had been commenced on the 10th. Notwithstanding a holyday, 850 cargas had been obtained the prior week. On the 5th 1.623 cargas were sold, and produced $5,739 ; and on the 17th another sale would take place (the earga beirg 3501b.). The haciendas of Dolores and Duran were fully employed on or from the mnine of Jesus Maria, and with good results."

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARBS. - Mondsy Evenibg. The railway-market has been influenced by the advene movement in the funds, and in at the Bpeculative descriptions a decline of from 11. to 21. bas taken place. Canadian and Indian shares also receded. A general reduction ocourred in French on the receipt of lower prices from Paris but chiefly from the expectation that the raising of the rate of discount here must cauBe a similar step to be taken by the Bank of France; Dutch Rhenish, Great Luxembourg, and Lombardo-Venetian also declined. American securities were heavy, and a fall of 31. occurred in Illinois Central shares. A fair amount of business has been done in mines, but prices show no alteration, except in East Basset, which were quoted at the clo".e about 101. lower. Joint-stock banks were dull, and no important variation has taken place. In miscellaneoux securities there was a recovery of IOs. in North of Europe Steam. ORDUIARY SHARES AND STOnfR
RAIZWAY rNTELLrGEZCE. BUFFALO ANMTD TAI1l TfTTRl The report of the directors of th!s company states that at the date of the last mneeting of shareholders the line had been but recently opened to Stratford. No further openiDg has since taken place, the ohara.ter of the works on the section from Stratford to Goderioh being snch that any partial opening of tho eastern end up to the present time has been impracticable. The road had beea opened to Stratford in great haste, to avoid the impending penalty for delay, so that a considerable amount of earth. works remained to be fiished, and a great portion of the baUast both between Paris and Stratford, and in some parts between Paris and Fort Erie; these are now reduced to a verytrif'ing amount, and some addi. tional baUast wlll be required. With two or three unim. portant exceptions, which are being set right, the road is tn substantial good order and equal to a large business. The line, it is expected, will be opened to Goderich on the 1st of January. The company is bound under heavy Penalty to open the line to Goderich on or before the 28th of June next ; but to make absolutely certain of this, in consequence of the poesible severity and length of the Canadian wrinter, it will be necessary to incur nearly the whole of the expenditure during the present year, as only a few weeks could be relied on for work next spring before the 28th of June. TTnder these circumstances the chairman took upon himself the responsibility of deciding that the works should be proseuted with the utmost vigour with a view to open the line in January. The cost of working the additionai 45 niiles will be but a small increase on the present worklng expenses. Fourteen miles were ready forthe permanentway,the laying of whici was commenced on the 14th of September. The rails on this section will be fished. The maintenance of the permanentway will be charged for the first yearto capital. The new ferryboat for carrying the cars across the Niagara river is nearly ready for launching and is receiving hor engines. The intended permanent landing on the Canadian shore is not yet commeneed. Arrangements will be made for running the new ferryboat to and from the present wbarf at Fort Brie. The engines and rolling stock of the company are of excellent quality and in thoroughly good condition, The cost of maintaining and ranning the engine3 and carriages has been at the rate of 27-7 cents per train anile for a total mileage on revenue account of 161,699 train uiles. The Oost of locomotive power separately is 18 89 cents per train mile. In conclusion, the directors remind the proprietors that their railway must not be estimuated either according to the unfavourable circumstances of the past few months or its present inoomplete position. It must be estimated as a whole, not likely to - show its real capabilities till the system aimed at is com- plete. Its future is that of an important trunk raiLw to and from the west and north-west. Its present X, little more than that of a detached lotal line through a dlst'rict temporarily exhausted of produce and depressed by the extraor4 dinar stagaation of buslneea, The total traffic on the line for the half-year ending the 31st of July last amounted to $113,629, including ,647 foreign traffic. The revenue account shows that the receipts for the half. year ending 31stJanuary,1857, amounted to $37,502, and the expenses to $42,446, leaving a balance of $4,944 agatnst revenue, The receipts for the half-year ending 31st July last amounted to $124,552, and the expensesto ,122,623, leaving a balance in favour of revenue of $1,928. The capital account showed that $1,779,637 had been received, and $1,788,165 expended, leaving a balance of $8,528 against the company. TBAFIC RETURNS. Miles Pan- ler- Total, ToW.

I T . MAJR-LMNX IdONDA"wv Arnvnc1fl 1i The arrivals law? week were generaUy abudant. -The exports were 1,383 quarters of wheat, 222 quarters of oats and 40 socls of flour. The receipts of English wheat were 8,987 quarters; of foreign, 30,216 quarters, two-thirds being Russian. The tupply for the morning was moderate; but the weather had affected several samples, and, with few buyers from the country, trade was exoes8ively heavy, red samples being 2s. per quarter lower, and white offered 2a. to 3s. cheaper, withont much business. In foreign the same heaviness pre. valled, and ab'out the samel concession was necessary in order to make any sale. Of country flour there were 20,492 saoks; of foreign, 3,765 barels. Factors found a vory heavy trade, though the nominal decline was only about Is. per sack. The newr American arrivals were not brought to market, but the few old were rather cheaper. Of barley there were 3,457 quarters of English and 9,389 quarters of foreign. The finest malting qualities only just maintained their valun, but al below them were difficult to quit at Is. to 2s. decUne. The malt trade was under the same Inflaence, the finest samples being Is. per quarter lower, and inferlor sorts 2s. to 3s. less money. Of oatg there were 1,382 quarters of English, 35 quarters of Sootch, 1,818 Irish, and 30,813 foreign, principally from Russia. The successive good arrivals have made sales v6ty diflfclt, and occasionally some concession was made In the price of new descriptione. The supply of Engllsh beaus was 1,041 quarters, of foreign 500 quarters. Of peas there were 1,043 quarters of English, and 830 quarters of foreign by coast. Businews was dull In both these linds of pulse, withoat much quotable alteration. The arrival of liluseed (all Russdau) was 9,550 quarters, the exports being 2,130 quarters. This better supply gave buyers favour to the extent of is. per quarter, but cakes sold well, and without abatement. In the seed trade but little was passing. The business in cloversoed and trefoil was very quiet, dealers preferring to wait tiUl nearer the semaon. Canaryseed was cheaper, somo foreign having appeared, and was a slow sgale. Tares continued dullL Rapeseed, mustardseed, and other sorts remained much as last quoted.

Yesterday the annual m o'. enterdiL the eet!tg l of he Wela en A~gri. cultural dociety was held, herei,plder Ste ireddonoy of Colonel Cator, MnDr. by. 4eorge Non&u r Caird, Mp,, Mr. ilkiaon,- late M.. for 'Lambeh, and the leading gentry of the neighbdoishd. A&fter th tusual prooeedings ir ae field .Ae mebersiand their f.iends dined together, Colonel Cator in the chair. lnpyropoqeg "The House of Coimmons," the Cantir coupled with it the name of Wr. C*ird, * niemuber of that Houso and a distinguished agriculturist. Mr. CARD, IL?., who was received with muoh.chheering in acknowledging the toast, bore testimony to the rnest. nets and zeal with which the House of Co mons lAbord for the welfare of the people. On one subject, howeveri, they had shown themselves lamentably deficient, for hexemem. bered going down one evening early in the last tfaesion, and finding the House almost emptyhe asked afriend atthe door what was going on? "Oh I nothing; some quebtion about tho tenure of laud in India" wa te nswer; and so little interest did the question then excite thatthe House was within an ace of being counted out. Very different would be the interest manifested on such a ques. tion now. And as a membor of Parliament heihould be deficient in his duty if, in addressing any, meeting of his fellow countrymen, he failed to call their attention to the revolt in India. He deemed this tbe greateag crisis in ths history of England ince the Reevolutlon. (Cheers.) It was not our business at present to philosopliize on the wouderful sPectade of a little island likeorirs, with lesm than 30,000,000 of people, ruling a mighty territorr with 180,000,000, at a distance of 10,0D0 riIle= This wag an inheritance bequeathed to us by our anoestors which we must retain at all hazards and at wrhatevel sacrifioe, or lose rank before the world. (Loud cheers.) There were two tbings connected with this outbreak 1hioh mem, wonderful indeed. First, the utter unpreparedness of the In. duan Government for a blow that must have been long In contemplation; and secondly, theheroic conshncy and courage of a small body of Englishmen scattered byhiandfuls over a line of 1,200 miles in length, surrounded not by an open enemy, but by tens of thousands of mutinos soldlers, whom they had been taught to look upon asf their comrades in armx. If we lost aome of our ancient prestige by taking only the second part in the campaign in the Crimea, England had in India reasserted her position by tho calmL heroism of her Anglo-Saxon sons, not picked men, but ordinary Englishmen. (Loudcheers,) Itwasdredfulto think of the atrocities that had been committed and the fearful re. tribution which must follow, but truly it njeded some such stern rebuke to rouse Eugland to inquiry sad exertion. What did the people or Parliament of England know of India? Literally nothing. We had treat4 it sa an. outlying fArm, which, if it left no grat prolit to ourselves, yet gave profitable employment and wealth to aome junior members of the family who were sent out to manage it. But the welfare of 180,000,000 of people was not so to be treated. (Eiea, hear.) For the talent wa had received we wero now called to refder an account, and if we had hid it in the ground, actuatod by no higbher motives than half-yearly dividend, the time seemed to have come when it must be taken from the hand that had failed to use it with advantage and be intrated to better keeping. (Cheers) For 100 years we hbad borne away over the richest territory in the world and had been , conented nob only to witness but to encourage the posseet idolatry aud superstition, without in all that time impressing upon the native populAtion a particle of the spirit of our relgion or our principles of truth, justioe, and humanity. (Hear, hear.) It was but a year ago that the Government in Indi admitted the truth of the statements in a memorial sented to them, which alleged that the rural populatlon of Bengal, many millions of people, were IlUffezig from a. native magistracy who were oopt, oppressive, and incompetent, who encouraged the concealment and Iommlstion of crime, while the people were'reduced to beggary and pitiabbl servitude. (Hear.) The timehad not come, nor Wa thix the place, for discussing our futare Indian poli ; but the light was now bursting in, and the =pee of E ngad would not permit its fair fame to be tarnihed by the coutinuanoe of a policy which bore no better fruits than these (Hear.) We must have due precedence given in our Indian empire to English ideas language, And religion, not intolerant of the religion of otbers so long as it was not offepsive to morAls, but giving no public countenance or encour rsement to idolatry, and selecting for special reward in the servicoe of the State those, whether natives or Engish, who best approved themselves our friends by similarity of religiorn language and spirit. (Loud cheers.) He begged to offer one word in conclusion on the vengeance to be taken on the ruthless murderers of English women And cfildren. There was surely no need to encourage such a spirilt. It might be "'Iell left in the hands of those who were on the spot, who coul best appreciate the crime and mete out Its punishment. He had no fear but that the generous and merciful character of the Euglish soldier would at the proper time temper justioe with mercy. (Much cheoring.) An interesting discussion followed, in which the Chair. man, Mr. Norman, and Mr. Caird, ILP., took part, on the relative ecpense of farm labour In England and Scotland, and the condition of the agricultural labourer in the two countries. Mr. Norman, who had lately visited a border county and had specially investigatedthis subject, eontended that the lower wages of labour in Scotland and the mode iii which they were pid in ldnd enabled the farmer at the. expensoef the labourer, to py a higher rent for his land. He deprecated such a system, and should not wish to see It Introduced into this country. Mr. Caird, on the other hund, showed, by taklng Mr. Norman figuree, that at the prices of the last three years the payment of the Scotch labourer In ldnd gave him a much greater sapply of the comforts and necessaries of life than could be pro. cured by the money wages of the EngUsh labourer, who had to pay out of his wages a weekly house rent while the Scotch farm labourer lived rent free. He also pointed to the fact that such a thing as An agricultural labourer seek. ing prsh relief was unkiown in Scotland, while here they gave prlzes to the labourer who could brlng up his famUy without parish aid. Ho agreed with Mr. Norman that a certain expenditure on labour was more productive on a Scotch than an Bnglish farm, and thus left a larger balsnce for rent. Bat that aro from the indivldual labouter being bette- Wed, better educated, and thus more intellgent, while his labour was more economically and effectively applied on fArms laid out with a speCal reference to the production of crops. He found no fault with laudlords who preferred the beauty and charm of woodland scenery, sma encosures, wide hedg6rows, and A good head of game, and within that distance of London he thought they were right in doing so, for their property would ultimately become more valuable as attractive bnilding sites than for agricultural purposes. But in such circumstances labonr must be more costly and lees effective, and agricultural rents proportionslly low. (Hear, hear.) Mr. WriuNsoN, in proposing " the health of the ChaLir. mnan," said, thathe made it a rulenever to sW-ak on a subject which he did not understand, and he had therefore takem no part In this disoussion. On former occasions in that room he had argued some unpalatable questions, but he believed they now all agreed with him that farmers, like other classes in this coontry, required no othei rotction than their own skill, enterprise, and industry. is orn agrictltural experience was comparativelylimited, and It reminded him of a question that wae put to him a few days ago by an eminent banker and landowner in this neighbourhood,- "Mr. Wilkinson, are you afflioted writh a farm r (Laughter,) He concluded by proposing "the health of the Chairman," which was received with much cheering. Colonel CAMOn returned thanks, referring in the course of his speech to the advantage of providing Improved dwellings forthe labourers, and After a few other toasts the meeting broke up.
LONDON, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1857. Au East India Director is for the moment an interesting personage. The Board has awaked to find itself famous. A few months ago it was only a conclave of gentlemen conversant, or sipposed to be conversant, with Oriental matters, which were a mystery to the public. Military Service, Civil Service, Courts of Sudder Adawlut, PRajahs, their heirs' pensions, quarrels, and grievances, were matters which no reader could be found to wade through in his newspaper, no member to listen to in the House. Now all is changed. Who would venture to skip the driest detail from Leadenha]l-atreet ? Who would lose the faintest accent of a Directors speech ? One of the 24 has just spoken to Leominster and the world. Mr. J. P. WiLLouGnBY could not refrain from satisfying the impatience of his auditory to know the causes of the Indian Revolt. He had, no doubt, found himself for some time previously the centre of many a little knot anxious to be enlightenci as to the causes which have raised a whole army against our authority. So the oracls has spoken, but oracularly. We are still in doubt as to the precise causes of the calamity. We are only informed what they are not. By the use of the exhaustive method we may be able to arrive at the desired knowledge, but Mr. WILLOUGEBY indicates it only negatively. The first conclusion we are apt to draw from the address is that the mutiny had no cause at all; but, rejecting this on philosophical grounds, we are forced to believe that it had some transcendental origin, discernible by the eyes of a Director, and capable of being removed by a Board, but which must wholly escape the eyes of ordinary mortals. Mr. W=ouIJEmy approached the subject with the deliberation of one about to advance some tremendous dogma. His caution also was wonderful; he is expressing his own opinion only, and not that of a party; he is "only addressing you as "your representative in Parliament on a subject "of the deepest interest." Then comes the series of negamions. The hon. Director cannot agree with those who consider the movement as a national one. It is not a rising of a people against misgovernment and oppression, for the peasantry are quiet, and even In the vicinity supply us wvith provisions. 'hen, it is not a Royal or arlstocratical movement, for the Rajahs and Chefs are with us almost to a man. Both Princes and people show by their conduct that they respect our character and value our rule. AUl that is proved is, that the revolt is a military ons, confined to a portion of our army. Seventy to eighty thousand men have risen against tae Government and released from gaol some 12,000 criminalh, who have joined them in their ravages. Now, why did these troops rise themselves and make the gaol-birds join them ? That is the question which Mr. WnLLouGHBy fails to answer. The greased cartridges were used by the MIahomedan as a means of rousing the Hindoo; but how did the Mahomedans come to plot and the Hindoos to fall victims to them? Hear the explanation :-" There seems to have been a delucsion, almost amounting to insanity, which no "effort on the part of the authorities could possibly "have prevented." The speaker then continues to say what was not the cause. It was not the conduct of the European officers, or the centralization of authority, or the depriving commaanding officers of the power of punishment, or the abolition of flogging. It was not the missionaries, for they were not specially obnoxious to the people, and perished only with other Europeans. Some people may say it was the yearning of the Mussulmans after their lost dominion; "but whether " the yeariiing excited the revolt or the 6" revolt the yearning does not appear." At any rate, says the speaker, it could only have been a partial cause. As little was it the annexation policy of late times, which we are told was, after all, upheld by every party in this country, with the exception, on one or two occasions, of the East India Company. Such is all that a Director has to tell us at the present crisis. Eighty thousand men have risen in revolt, massacred our people, proclaimed the heir of the MoGuLs, seized a great city and arsenal, besieged our troops in the capital of our last acquired province, and one of the governors of the empire, a commercial lord of the East, informs us that there is no assignable cause of these calamities. Our families are plunged into mourning, our national honour imperiUled, and our national coffers emptied, by wh&t it is pretended is an uncontrollable and self-generated necesity. Now, though we cannot pretend that any one of the matters mentioned by Mr. WILLououBy was the true and only one, there are several to which we are inclined to assign a part and share in the disaster. Great political events eertainly seldom have any one clear and definite cause on which the historian can lay bi, finger a bIt there are gellera&Uy a number of eiroumstances having the same tendency, which together make up the complex cause of the event. So we think it is with India. Philosophers have gone bacX to the Franks to find the causes of the French RIevolution, and so an over-scrupulous inquirer may deduce the Bengal mutiny from the nature of Asiaties generally, and the iueffaeable character of races. But we must be content with simpler investigations. Az far, then, as it iB useful to inquire, it wrould seem that the proximate cause of the revolt was the general laxity and want of tone which marked the rule of the East India Company. We have not the slightest desire or intention to attack this body; we are willing to confess that any other set of rulers would in the same position have committed as great or greater faults. The defects of the Indian Government have been such as might be natually expected in the case of a few Europeans holding for the irt time in history the dominion over nillions of Asiatics. Still it is necessary to learn by experience, and to point out faults as soon as they become obvious. India, then, has been misgoverned to a certain extent because it has not received the attention of the nation which rules it. It has been left to functionaries, military and civil; and though these may be, and certainly are, as a general rilde, active, intelligent, and zealous, yet the system has been not the less sluggish, stationaxy, and i every day more unfitted to the condition of the country. In al that Mr. WILLOUGHBY says as to the kindness and justice of the Government we fully concur. The Mussulman ana the Elindoo have been governed as they were never governed before,-life and property have been made secure, inhLuman laws abolished, infamous rites discouraged or suppressed. The few Aaiatics who think and have the materials for thinking rightly wil do the Company justice, and even the people wiU naturaUy cling to the shelter of their rule. But still the system founded by HASTINGS and WELTFSLEY has had its day. It did well enough when the British provinces were comparatively small, and the Governors-General engaged in incessant wars to extend their domain. Then race was pitted against race, creed against creed. The Rajpoot Sepoy could be led against the Mahratta, and the Mussuli man would have been delighted with a campaign against the Slkh. Then the rough and ready way of turning soldiers into judges and clerks into captains woreed well enough; and the English officers or civilians, far from their native country and dependent on their own exertions, displayed a continuous energy which belongs to a first generation of conquerors. Now, however, the country is too vast, too completely subjected, and we believe too well-informed, for the old style of government to be safe. The army of Bengal consisted lately of 100,000 men, with nothing to do. Every enemy had disappeared. Every province, from Affghaniatan to the MIalay Peninsula, has been brought under subjection. Again, the means of comnunication are vastly superior to what they were in the old times, and the natives can use the same methods of conveying intelligence which are open to us. In fact, while the Company has not been innovating for the better, Time has been innovating for the worse, so far as their authority is concerned. Even such blessings as peace and a post-office have strengthened the natives against the Government, because the Government has negleeted to strengthen itself. We see in the material struggle of the Sepoys against us an emblem of the moral revolt which might, ere long, arise throughout Hindostan. The mutineers fight us with our own muskets and powder and percussion caps, our own guns and ohot and shell; they give the word of command as we have taught them, and mount guard over our own arsenal according to English military usage. So it is, or will be, with India generally. The people are getting, as it were, up to the Government, and, unless that be improved and invigorated, Asiatic cunning may play us more than one more dangerous trick. General weakness is the complaint under -which East Indian Government is suffering; laxity of military discipline, confusion in the civil service, and pandering to idolatrous usages, are only the outward effects of the disease. To no one of these singly may we owe the mutiny, but we owe it to the system out of which they have grown during a long course of years.
In the midst of the manifold anxieties which the Sepoy mutinies have craated, it is some satisfaction to reflect that the convulsions of the crisis have been confined to India. No commotion has occurred either in Affghanistan or Burmah; the Chinese question has been suspended without apparent prejudice to our position or our claims, and the actual evacuation of Herat, according to the terms of the treaty, has testified to the good faith and quiescence of the Persian Government. Our own colonies in other regions have, indeed, vibrated with the shock, but only, we are rejoiced to say, after the very same fashion in which we have been affected ourselves. Not even in London or Edinburgh, or Manchester, or any other great centre of British opinion, has more indignation been felt or more energy aroused than in those colonial establishments which lie between England and her Eastern Empire. The Governors of these settlements have risen promptly to the level of the emergencies before them, and have despatched succours in every form to India with a generosity and zeal deserving the approbation of all Of these colonies Ceylon was the nearest to the scene of mutiny, and to its Governor was the first appeal of Lord CAz oG preferred. It met with an immediate response. Although the population of Ceylon itaelf had but recently passed through the tumults of a revolution, and apprehensions might naturally be entertained of some renewed disturbance at so agitating a crisis, Sir I. WARD instantly forwarded to Calcutta almost every British soldier in the island. The reinforcements thus procured were scanty, it is true, amounting only to a few companies of Infantry, with a small proportion of Artillery, but their arrival was opportune in the extreme, and we have seen in more than one instance that the presence of 200 or 300 Europeans has sufficed to retard or suppress a revolt on the very point of explosion. Next to Ceylon comes the Mauritius, and here again the garrison of the island was unhesitatingly surrendered for the assistance of our coumtrymen in India. The 5th Fusileers at Calcutta, the 33d and 4th Reglments at Bombay, represent the welcome succours due to Sir JAMES 3iGGoisoN's alacrity and devotion, and every possible exertion has been employed by the authorities in a cause which they regard with the same intensity of feeling experienced at home. It is at the Cape, however, as might be expected from the magnitude and resources of the colony, that the zeal and energy of the Governor and people have been most signally expressed. Sir GEORGE Ga, on the receipt of intelligence from the Bombay authorities, at oncea answered th- appeal by forwarding in the transports which were waiting for them every man and horse available at the moment. Four stroug and seasoned regiment3 have thus been despatched to India from the Cape-a reinforcement of which it is impossible to overrate the importance; and, what desrves especial mention, the efforts of the Governor were seconded by the mest patriotic support on the part of the colonists. *in order that every addier wNit b sparoa& lot India, the inhabitants of Cape Town and its vicinity cheerfully took upon themselves all the duties of the garrison; and, as the demand for horse3 was especially urgent, the studs of private stables (including that of the Governor himself) were freely yielded for the service of the expedition, without any such enhautcement of price as the occasion would naturally have brought about. The crisis, indeed, appears to have evoked all the best feelings of a British community. It is not so very long ago that the Cape settlers were banded together to resist the policy of the Home Government on the transportation question; but these ranklings, if they survived the occurrence at all, have utterly vanished before the demands of this painful conjuncture, and the citizens of Cape Town, and the colonists generally, appear possessed with the same solicitude and animated by the same determination as we feel in England. To estimate such zeal and services at their proper value, we must remember that up to the date of the very last mail the Governments of Calcutta and Bombay had been indebted to these sources alone for every single soldier that had reached them. The head of the great eolumn of British reinforcements wa, indeed, approaching, but all the stssistance as yet actually received by Lord CarrTG and his colleagues in their arduous exertions had been derived from our colonial establishments. It was from Ceylon tbat the indefatigable Governor-General acquired the timely aid of the 37th; itwas from the Mauritins that Lord ELrnPlIsrTo received the 33d and 89th; and it was from the Chinese Expedition, promptly diverted hv Sir GoERGE Gr from raongkong to india, that the authorities of Calcutta obtamned the 90th and the 23d. The immeiate action of England, indeed, could not be felt for months-it has not been perceptible even yet-and Lord CA-NIG was left for the protection of India against a monster revolt to the outnumbered forces of the empire itself and to the succours which our colonies could afford. WeU has it been both for India and Britain that these succours were provided with such generous self-sacrifice and despatched with such untiring zeaL The record of these services suggests also some especial remark on the promptitude, energy, and success which have characterized Lord ELPHIUSTONIE'S administration at Bombay through this period of alarmL Of thisPresidency, as of Madras also, we are entitled to say that the opinions we expressed in regard to their positions at the commencement of the mutinies have been substantially verified. If, indeed, it could have been predicted in June last that Delhi would have remained uncaptured nip to the beginning of September, probably few persons could have prevailed upon themselves to believe in the immobility of the Madras and Bombay Armies through a season of such protracted trial. Yet, notwithstanding these temptations, the great bulk of the Sepoy forces in both Presidencies have absta;ned from mutiny, and the southern portion of India has been almost denuded of European soldiers without any material interruption of political tranquillity. We cannot, however, conceal from ourselves or our readers that the preservation of order in Bombay has probably been owing more to the energy of the Government than to the intrinsic fidelity of the native troops or the loyalty of the Mahomedan population. In Rajpootana, where Bombay troops in some numbers had taken the duties of the Bengal mutineers, they hive not been proof against the incitements around them, and, though the first symptoms of revolt in the Presidency itself were happily stifled, and have not hitherto reappeared, the result must be ascribed in great measure to the rapidity with which reinforcements were procutred, and the judgment with which they were employed. Without consuming valuable hours in useless circumloeution, Lord EarPHI?STONE, upon his own authority and rcsponsibility, sent vessels to the Mauritius and the Cape to bring up troops to his succour. His vigorous measures found happily a counterpart in the energies of the two Colonial Governors; the arrival of a single wing of the 33d sufficed to inspirit the European community; the revolters were cowed at the sight of this handful of bayonets, and the turn of the trembling balance was deeided in favour of Government and order. This amount of success and good fortune is as much, we think, as could reasonably have been anticipated. It could hardly have been expected that the Bombay troops should altogether and in every case have resisted the coutagion of a protracted mutiny in the adjacent provinces, and the solicitations of insidious emissaries capable of turning such temptations to the best account. But they have taken the infection only partially and yielded to its influence slowly, while a small European force has proved hitherto sufficient to control the disaffected and preserve the ascendancy of Government against all the schemes of the seditious. We can only trust that this superiority may be well maintained, and that Lord ExNixSrONE may witness the reward of his energy in the continuedtranquillity of Bombay, while the plains of Eindostan receive a final pacification through the sharp but sure agency of the sword.
The annual distribuition of national medals for specimens of artistic design, which took place some days ago at Manchester, appears to have produced a very respectable show. There are " anatomical "studies," "heads," "foliages in outline," "oak leaf C"bosses, .,. 'pilasters," "egg plants," "primroses," "rosettes," "flowvers in tempera," "TRAJAJ scrolls," " Florentine scrolls," " friezes," " cars," " dis"coboluses," " dancing girls," ";lions," "Â¢LAo- c CooNs," " fruit," CC vases," '" urns," C kettles," " cups and saucers," IIHERcuEsxs," " ho?lyhocks," " ribands," " muslins," " lace." We cannot complain of want of variety. All this is a stimulus to bring out " the eye" of the British people-the eye, we mean, of course, in the artistic sense. A good deal of our nature has been developed, but they say-and we suppose it is true enough-that " the eye" has not. We are first-rate mechanics, and can master the most intricate relationships of wheels; we subdue the earth and bend the metals to our will, btit that myaterious faculty called " the eye"tthat inner guide and directing power which from some sanctuary within the brain transmits motion to the fluger-ends-has not been brought out. The subtle science of curves and angles, on which effects depend, is still a very latent and buried faculty in the English mind. So far, at least, as we could augur from the last teapot, urn, and sugar-basin that were exposed in the shopwindows, we believe that at this moment it would be dangerous to apply even Lord GAxVrE's very elementary test at all generally-that "to lay a knife and fork per"fectly parallel to one another reqaires the sort of "eyewhichis perfectedby a drawing lesson or two." Very few of us could stand even this very rudimental test, and should have to take our first drawing lesson before even we could finish dinner gracef'1y. Do we not leave off ea ing like barbarians,witl-out the least idea of a proper attitude for our knife and fo*k, and, what is still worse, eat lik-e them, too, wit. out the slightest reference to the gracefulnusag of our actions ? All this would be much alered if we siudied LAocooNs. and Nio:ss. A Lord ! eayel feast would be a perfect luxu)irnb labyriz& of goo-d curves per.ormed in th_ct of coni Wing the turtle and venison to o-ar mouths-a scete of trmultuomabeauty, like tl. Rape of the la ~ QCA triRth, 9unh ' BA(COQV, It is poMibeWq may never attain to such perfection, but.even in the practicable development of the eye we have not advanced far. What a want of even moderate inspiration there is in most of our furniture, china, and metalwork ! You go into one of our enormous marble warehouses, and see hundreds of chimuney-pieces, which follow a fixed, immoveable tradition-having exactly the same bulge in the same place, the same perpetual centrepiece, &ac. A iile of camels on the Great Desert woud not supply a more barren choice. Our marble artists are the slaves of precedent, and their profession shows the signs of an old family dynasty, upon the ancient Egyptian principle, upon which all trades were hereditary, and were transmitted, along with the family idols, mummies, and sarcophaguses, from father to son. But now, with the help of our Schools of Design, we are going to turn over a new leaf. The eye of the nation is to be developed, and we may look forward to an age-as marvellous as the Golden Age in this country-of good chimneypieces, grates, fenders, elegant papers and curtains, chintz and damask, classical carpets, anxchairs, and sofas,-an age in which there will be no difficulty in choosing a good breakfast, dinner, or dessert service. Fancy that. It is difficult to say, of course, how much of this dream will be realized. I When a nation has gone for a thousand years -with an undeveloped " eye," one begins to suspect that there are some considerable obstacles to its dovelopment. On the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that the " eye," like the voice, or like imathematical talent, or like engineering talent, being a part of our nature, will always exist. however latently, in a certain proportion of the popu1ation. Every thousand men in Grert Britain, we know, contains a tolerable carpenter, a tolerable mason, a fair plumber and glazier. Increase the area of number, and it will give a good engineer, and should it not give a man with an " eye " We are not a musical nation, and anybody who has been in Germany knows the difference of the German musical atmosphere from our own. In that vocal country music seems to grow spontaneously, and chords come floating over the air as if they were its native inhabitants; every other group in the streets is a group of gleesingers. We ask how all the people learnt to sing, and the answer is that they learnt to sing just as they learnt to talk,-by hearing everybody I else singing about them. Music in this country has a very stiff, professional, and artificial place; it is the property of a privileged class of masters, and whoever wants to have any share of this valuable gift must purchase it by quiarterly patments. Yet, even in unmusical England theru is not a village in which a fair choir may not be got up if people wMil take the pains. IJpon the same law, we presume, we may reckon upon an eye"' existing latently in one of every thousand or two thousand, or whatever number it may be, of the population. But the truth is, this island -was for many centuries outside the great march of European art. We may not like to ov, n this feature in our history, but our national monuments betray it. Our cathedrals are, indeed, iire-rate edificee, i because the Church had the advantage of a most compact organization, which brought all parts of it into intimate connexion with a common centre. The Church had the advantage then of the advancement of European art; but the nation was a good deal removed from it, and we were externally,-in point of town architecture, streets, public buildings, houses of nobility, &c.,-rather a rough people at the time that Italy, Germauy, and France displayed much artistic luxuriance, and lodged its magistrates and nobles in palaces fit almost for the gods. Remains of our medizeval streets are to be seen now in some of our old towns-in Bristol, for instance-and what are tbey ? Why, very poor specimens of ornamental building, much inferior to the old streets of foreign towns. Our old wood and plaster houscs, with their overhanging upper stories and gables, picturesque as they are, and endeared to us as monuments of the past, do not bear any comparison with the elaborate richness, the luxury of carving and moulding, the dignity and amplitude of foreign buildings of the same date. Our insular fog intercepted the mellow light of Italian art and disconnected us in a great measure from the European centre of taste and professional skdll; and the Reformation for some time tended to confirm the estrangement. All our Puritan prejudices were against the false allurements of continental art, combined as it was with the Roman religion, and used to a great extent to illustrate its doctrines and worship. We now feel the effects of this insular and traditional separation from the centre of European art and taste, of having been for so many ages islanders and not continentals, aud we are very properly trying to remedy them. We have our Schools of Design, and o~ur annual national prizes for succ .s, we are stirring up the emulation of youth, and we invite the lower classes to enter the school of competition. Our statesmen preside at these ceremonials, and give them all the weight of authority. Nor can there be any reason why we should not succeed, but, though a School of Desiga may soon be formed, it tak-es a long time to create a national atmosphere of taste.

THE MANOHBSTEB ExHIBIXION. TO THE EDITOR OF TE: TIMES. Sir,-In the notice of the closure of the Manchester Exhibition of Art Treasures which appears in your impression of this day MIr. "William " Fairbairn's name is given as the Chairman oÂ£ the Executive Comrmittee. This is an error wbich you will, perhaps, be good enough to rectify. Mr. "Thomas" Fairbairn's name should have been given. The father has been confolinded with the son. At bome and abroad the name of the father has long been known as one of our foremost men in engineering science. The name of Thomas Fairbairn, his son, will long be gratefullly associated by bis fellow citizens and coiutrymen with the successful organization and triumphant cmpletion of one of the noblest schemes. which our age has seena realized.

TE UVIITED STApES. (nom OuBR NEW YOQRK COREEspV.AM NEW YORlK, OCr. 6. _By the Arabia, ariving at this port on the 2d -Inst., we gat the comments of the English press upon the extraordinary hurly-burly in WVall-street a month since, when all New York wa., trembling to know whether the banks would make enough advance to the Erie Road to prevent its coupons from towg to protest. The Tiwnes, as usual, hits the a8il. on the head, and says in a few words more about the real state of things that then prevailed, -than any New York journal did for a week after it. In the midst of such a state of ex-citement one is apt to over-estimate minor causes, to give them undue importance, and to ,pass by the real sources of 'tle trouble. Some of the London journals seem to have had a aimilar capacity for error. One of your contemposaries that usualy assumes to possess peculiar sources of information about things upon this continent dwells upon the recklessly profuse style of living which, it says, forms so atriking a feature of society in New York, as the main cause of the financial troubles that still surround ws. That there is plenty --of free living here cannot be doubted; but that the usual style of living is recklessly profuse you will be inclined to doubt when I tell you that there are not ten men in New York (and 1 doloubt whether there are five) who spend 5,0001. a-year. Men of moderate means perhaps live nearer up to their incomes than do Englishmen in the same rank of life; and gamblers on the StoÂ¢k-Exchange here, as well as in London and .Iarla, imitate at a snobbish distance the manners of atioblemen of large fortunes. No nation can claim exclusive possession of the race of HIluntingdons and Ptedpaths. Even the pious Paul and his sanctimonious partners can be matched elsewhere. To no .-nuch temporary and individual cause as this is the recent and present panic to be attributed. I do not 'think it was even brought on by such causes. The -effect in the stock-market was unquestionably in creased by the freedom of expenditure by the stocklbrokers and outside gamblers, who are, I fancy, ;pretty much the same animals the world over; but to suppose that they could by their personal extravagance produce the serivus effects which we have witnessed in commercial circles throughout -the couDtry is to give to a small " boo" a prodigious effect upon a very great calf. I need not dwell again upon the real causes of %the trouble. It is enough to say that everybody *now feels a trifle more cheerful. The arrival of the -Star of the West (about which we had begun to feel anxious) and the prompt payment of the first batch -of October notes maturing on Saturday have set the .general batch at least three notes higher. The manner in which the New York merchants have passed through acrisis that has diminished the value ofthe best kinds of property 25 per cent., and of some .-f the railway properties niuch more, entitles them to all credit. Up to this time there have been very few mercautile failures. The most Important one is the old fur house of P. Cheauteau and Co., which is understood to have been largely interested in Illinois Central. In Boston they have niot had equally good luck. Some of tae oldest, -best established houses have gone to the wall in ,the general destruction of rmanufacturing property. That community exhibits a very sound feeling in 'its tribulations, and seems resolved that its banks shall continue to maintain specie payments. The -Boston merchants had a sort of town meeting the other day, and resolved that this was policy -as well as honesty. There is now a little better feeling there as well as here, and I hope that the banks will go through. The New York " bear" organ yesterday morning expressed the belief that we have seen bottom; that the country, after all, is not ruined; and that we shall by and by come on our feet again. I need not say that I -share the opinion. The crisis has been a fearful -one; the weak ve3sels have collapsed, but the .strong ones that have stood the shock far outnumber them, and if we can get over the difficulty of getting the crop to market, we may hope that aU will be right once more. The perturbations in domestic exchange are now the great trouble. The business in New York is done on a specie basis; the business in the country on a paper basis, with the "cur. renoy," as it is called, of country banks to represent money. The crops being arrested by the extreme -caution of the farmers, exchange on New York is absolutely impossible. A merchant in Chicago wishing to make a remittance to New York bas ,only "currency" to do it with, and with this he annot buy exchange. In this way the funds, as well as the property of the country, are at a dead lock, and so must stay until confadence is restored. The best-informed bank directors look for a speedy change for the better. Mr. Stevens, the head of the Bank of Commerce, writes to a Boston friend:- " Our banks are prepared and now ready, and will soon * be much stronger, for the wise action of liberal aid to the community, More coin flows into the city from all quarters -from Philadelphia, from the West, and is already on its way from Europe. " A California steamor is due with about half as much more as there is in all Mssachusetts. Some of our banks have scarcely diminithed their loans for two months, notwithstanding their aid to neighbouring cities. The large banwl have expanded, and wiiU continue to expand. On the system of dlsooanting mainly only short paper they always have money to loan, When wiUl yours confine themselves to short dates sad cease to encourage the pernicious system of long credits-credits ramified to the last degree, from which spring most of your diffculties? Our corresponding bawks in Boston are advised that we will not press them for their balances." The general bank statement for the week scazcely justifies the strong tone of confidence that pervades this extrct. It shows the following changes from -the statement of the preceding week:- DolAs. Decrewa ot Loans..1,5,^J3A De-ease of specie.. 1s 26 682 De.ase of mxawn deposits.. . 4,120.497 Incraase t n cieantO .. .. .. 77,7 The New York Daily Times (money article) com-anents upon this statement very justly:- "The liquidation is general and unexpectedly heavy in leach department. The figures show in a very palpable way the effect of the financial storma of last wveek, and the extent to whioh our banks were drawn upon beoause of the trouble in other quarters; the doubt or uncertainty which It inspired here, and the assistance which it called forth in ColAto the support of nearly all the specie-paying points. Nearly oue-half thb. large draught of $4,C0J,000 upon the line of deposits appears to have been met in gold; most of the remainder going to the liquidation of debt due to the bans. Little or no aid was received from the Sub-Treasury 4disbursement of $2,029,000; the Mint took $400,00O, and -the savings banks $850,000. Most of the latter Is held in -their own vaults for employment in States' stocks as the -opportunity ocunr. Including the Sub-Treasury statement of Saturday aftes-noon and the Cleariog-house operatiors of -the week, 'which were unusually light (averaging only $15,180,291 per day), the following is the general compaison with the previous week, and also with the corresponding 'week of last year:- CO0LM,LRATIrVE icAPrmULATION.

The complete prostration of the manufacturing interest has thrown a great many operatives out of employ. We anticipated a winter of inusual suffering.

" TELEOBAPR" AND " TELEGRAM." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It was with .eal astonishment that I read Mr. Walford's statement in your paper of this morning, that ',the verb r7iXsE-yptttv is formed according to the very strictest analogy of language 1" Is there any other A.A. c, Oxford, and late or pi:esent scholar of BAflslol, who is igncrant of the fact that such a compound verb is an ltnposslbility, and who wonlt ' Et to ryXtypdityua from rnlsXypa4ew ? From the 5.iJ of Scaliger down to our time all competent Greek scholars have been aware that rY)Xrjpa0iW, from . ?XEyp7ipoc, is the regular form of a verb involving a synthetic compound, and that the barytone 7qAkypifOw would be a gross barbarism. (See Scaliger on Pk",nichus, p. 266, ed. Lobeck.) fie must be a bold man who invites the world-wide circulation of 2We Timew, to advertise his unacquaintance with this piece of information. With regard to the question of " Telegram v. Telegraph" Mr. Shilleto has said all that is necessary; bat, having called attention many years ago to the point on which Mr. Walford has committed such a blunder, I feel myself obliged to pro. test against a soleoism which, if allowed to pass without a rebuke, might bring discredit on the scholarship of England.

THE " FIRST-CLASS" COLLISIOZS OX THE CAlBBRIDGE AND OXFORD LINES. (See She Timnes, Oct. 15) TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIhES. Sir,-When Cambridgeand Oxford "First-Class" trains come into collision the world around stands awe-struck and amazed. "Telegram" is a correctly formed word, says Oxford "First-Class." " Telegram" is a barbarism, says Cambridge "First-Class." And each appeals to every one 'who knows anything at all of Greek that he is right. I used to know something about Greek, and, like the two antagonists, had the honour to be a First-Classman. In answer to the appeal, though a Cantab, I must in this case give my voice on the other side. Let our good friend, Mr. "R. S.," only regard tho adverb r-iXs as used as a preposition (and it is constantly so used-rTAE 0lXAwv, &c., Hom.); and by his own showing " Telegram" is correctly formed, after the analogy of anagram, epigram, &c. Bat, supposing " Telegram" to be a barbarism, whiat is Mr. "i E. S.'s" kindly offered substitute, " Telegrapheme"! Will Mr. " R. S." enlighten us as to the etymologicl propriety of this his bantling ! I confess to me it seems a sort of "ovOÂ° t Xir7 ssaXE-p7vv, such a creation as once puzzled poor old Bacchus, and kept him awake all night trying to malke out what bird it was. True, in verbs compounded 'with nouns the final w (omega) wil be resolved into Ew ; thus, from 4wov and ypc0ow, we have 4wypcuE&i ; and hence 7Y7PC)47a. But ,-FIXe having nothing to do vith the nature of a noun, but being used (as above stated) as a preposition, the final w in yp'pwo, in compositlon with it, would remain unchanged, and 7TAs-7pc00EV and r7iXeypaptai would be compounds corrcutlv fonned. With regard to the "vile Americanism," "reliable," to me it seems as good English, and formed in much the same way, as "deniable," "undeniable," "eatable," "drinkable," " pitiable," and a thousand other such vwords. I fear our excellent Cambridge "First-Claw' friend is getting fastidious. Eelieve me, Sir, yours with all rssuaett A. a.
" TELEGRAM" OR " TELEGRAPHE;jl-E." TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,--No man is better able to defend a philolo ical po3bion than Mr. Shilleto. In case, however, that heshould not think it worth his while to break a lance with his oppo. nent, Mlr. Walford, I venture to trouble that gentleman, and any of your readers interested in the controversy, with the grounds of Mr. Shilleto's accurate distinctlon. T1,Eypa601ua, the word he suggests, is descended from a hypothetical rnXnypa06v, just as amayp6oqppa (Plat. Thecart., 208) comes from the sufficiently common verb aoLaypa4)e-tv, as C-,ypaioita is derived from l,ypaoeZv; and +Â£vaopccppa from iEvaoypa1ta7v. With regard to the rival form r11,ypappa MIr. Walford will find, if he consults his lexicon, that ypciaya is compounded only with prepositions. Thus we have I-riypaycta, 7rpbypap pa, atiyypajuya, &c., but povacipappxa was never written as yes by Greek or barbarian. The Grameo-English monogram comes, I believe, from a Gra&eo-Latin m onogrammna, the coinage, apparently, of an African bishop of the fifth century. This word, being feminine, of the first declension, has nothing whatever te do with epigramma and its congeners ; it is apparently a feminine inflection of yovoypappioc, an adjective of tolerably reputable parentage. An obvious but false analogy led medieval writers to inflect "monogramma," " monogrammtatis," in the third declension; and hence, I suppose, the puov6ypapa of the Latin lexicographers Forcellini and Ducange. Meanwhile, to those interested for the preservation of your very useful coinage, "telegram," I venture to point out adroypac iv, in Aritet. Mfetaph1., vi., 1, 6, ed. Oxon., as supplying, on the w;hole, a better false analogy than epigram, For mny own part, I am thankful to you for a serviceable gift-horse, destined, as I fully believe, to survive the critics who have had the had taste to "look him in the mouth," Your obed;ent TeVA,I+t G.

THE REPRESE2TATIOiQ OF OLDfAmL-Yesterday being the day fixed by his worship the mayor of Oldham for the nomination of a fit and proper person to represent Oldlam in Parliament, a temporary hustings was erected, and thereto his worship proceeded, accompanied by "he friends of Mr. W. J. Fox. Mr. Fox himself was not present, but was represented by Mr. William Knott. The absence of all opposition rendered the proceeditgs remarkably tame, and business could scarcely be said to be suspended. T'hemayor having opened the proceedings, Mr. Fox was proposed by Dr. Leach, and seconded by Mr. Robert Yates. No other candidate being pro osed, his worship pronounced Mr. W. J. Fox to be duly elected. Mr. Willam Knott, in returning thanks on behalf of Mr. Fox, remarked that the next session would be highly important-first, on account of the Reform Bill which had been promised, and to which Mr. Fox wonld give his attention; but the most important matter to be brought before Parliament during the next session would be British India. Relative to this he might remark that India was not only to be reconquered but re. constructed. An ascendancy of bayonets was not what was needed for India, but the ascendancy of those principles to which England owed its glory. It would be necesary to have attention directed to the civil, social and religious condition of India, and to these Mr. Fox's vigorous mind would be directed. He was convinced that Mr. Fox wonld fairly represent the feelings of the people of Oldham. Mr. Fox, he remarked in conclusion, was a first-class man, and in him were conjoined the habits of a gentleman with the ability of a scholar, the power of an orator, and the discern. ment and judgment of a statesman. A vote of thanks to the mayor concluded the proceedings.

A long and laboured article in this morning's number concludes with these damning remarks :- " Orangeism exhibits Protestantism in ai campdefended by intrenchmenta thrown up halt a century ago; them smrrounded on every side by a multitudinous enema , making desperate sortiesoccasionally, and iflictnsignal;eWeamce. And now, long after peace has been ostablhsbea when the barracks of the Queen are full of troops to nrottet them, the OraDgemen obstinately keep the old g8 indbraDding all Protestants as false or doubtful who lo not -wear their colours, and as hee-rodox who do not speal, their shibboleth.

What has it ever done to strengthen and extend the Protestantism of this country? By its own confession-nothing. It was besieged in its camp, occupied solely in defending its own existeno. What has it done for poor Protestants, even as a benefit society? Where are its almshouses and its schools, its asylums for old age and orphanage ? How many of the Protestant societies which fill the Rotunda during the month of April bave been founded and supported by the Orange Society ? Those educational aud missionary societies are the strength and the glory of Protestantiam. It is by them that Roman aggresSion is encountered and repelled Instead of lying besieged in their camp, cultivating lilies mendbag flags, and keeping alive the memory of battles, the propagandists of Protestantism boldly advance against the enemy, like the liberating host of Havelock, attacldng Satan's strongholds, and still marching on Iconquering and to conquer.' The whole history of Christianity proves that the phllosophy of Orangeism on this point is unsound. True religioL cannot be preserved without being propagated. While the church is merely defensive she languishes and be. comes feeble. But when she goes forvmrd armed for the war against ignorance, superstitiou, idolatry, anti-Chris. tianism, and spiritual despotism, she becomes Istrong in the Lord and in the power of His mi'ht,' worthily fulfilling her mission as Ithe light of the world'" THE MON-TARY CRIS1S. According to the generally correct authority of the trade report of the ffreeman's Jornal, commercial matters here are on a perfectly fi-m and sound basis, and, except the severity of the high rate of interest, there is no pressure of any kind. There is not any urgency for discounts, and the banks appear to be acting pretty liberally towards their customers. Two bankruptcies appear in the last D'ublin sazette, one a country one, reported to be rather heavy, and the other a Dublin one, of mnor consequence. As a whole, the traders never passed through what has been a trying year with surer credit and less disaster. High prices, high interest, dimihished consumption, and general du. ness have now ruled for many months. The following is extracted from the trade report of the Freemant's J snzla of this morning- "No further 1ight has been thrown upon the Belfast tea frauds, and it appears likely that the principal party has for the present escaped apprehension; and although some of the Ihelps' have been laid hold of, none of theI respectable' accomplices, by whose aid and connivance 70,0001b. weight of tea had been stolen, have been brought to justice. Without knowing much of the circumstances, it seems to us that there was a good deal of remissnesswith the Customs' authorities. It appears the fraud was discovered on Thursday, nearly 24 nours before MIoore left Belfast, and he was not even put under surveillance; and we have heard it statedwe know not how truly-that It is a positive fact that the Board in Londonwere not made acquainted with the circunstance until Monday, four days after its discovery in Belfast. It is within our knowledge that on Saturday, our own collector, Mr. Gardner, was not even made acquainted with the occuMrence, although one of the first personas who should have heard of it, possessing, as Is known, the confidence of the Board in London, and aectually selected by them to condr.ct tbe inquiry. A reward of 200h. has been offered by Government for the apprehension of the delinquent." THE PAPAL DELEGATE. Archbishop Cullen has returned from Rome to his head-quarters in Dublin.

TEnm LAST SAVED FROMS THE CErTEAL ArTRicA. -After a lapse of 16 days since the first party of those saved from the Central America were landed at Norfolk from the gallant little brig Marine, and when every hope of seeing any more of the unfortunate passengers and crew of the lost steamer had been almost extinguished, three more have beenreturned to their homes. After enduringthemost terrible sufferings on the open sea for nine days-they were without food or water-drenched with the waves, exhausted fromi exposure, and reduced to skeletons from starvation, they were mercifully snatched from death in the darkest hour of despair. The account of their long agony, is harrowing. One of them, Tr. Tice, the second englneer, was drifting on a plank for 72 hours, when, espying one of the damaged lifeboats, he fortanatey succeeded in reaching her, and soon after fell In with the other two, Grant and Dawson, clinging to the hurricane deck of the steamer, and took them off. There is a sad episode in the story of these two mnen. It appears that at one time there were 12 in all on the hurriane deck, of whom 10 perished miserably from exposure and starvation-a slow, lingering, and painfal death. While drifting about at t'ie mercy of the waves they saw several others clinging to portions of the wreck, but were uanable to aid them; and, as there is no account of any of them having been taken off by any other vessel, the painful con. clusion Is forced upon us that ihey are lost-that we shall never he.-r more of the brave Herndon and the hundreds of unfortunateg who went down with him on the deck of the Central Ameria. It is a rmarkable fact that tbe men lst rescued had drifted on their frail support nearly 600 miles from the spot where the seamer sank, before they were picked up-a dreary voyage, the terrors of which, with a protracted and agonizin.. death staring them in the face, no one but themselves caa realize. There are few instances, if any, on record of mea enduring so much from tbe disasterof shipwreok, yet cemlig so bravely thro,gh It. Though there is little cause for hope that any more will be or have been saved, still there is EL bare possibility that some of those seenr clibgln to the captain's cabin or the wheel house may have 'been pieked up by some vessel not yet heard from. We sincr.rely tust, though we hardly dare hope, that it may be so.- -New Bark Herald. TP: OCow3isu Fisusrrrzs.-Upwavrds of 400 hob1has of fio pUchsards were taken by Messrm. Bolitho a Ij,r,., of B.

The CHswseiXA eaid,-It would be useless at the prawn'. mioment to trawe the o;gin of the revolt, but he felt satisfled is was not to be satributed to the attempted converaion of the natives to Ckistianity, as the lnsurrection had been purely military, tbeapdople generally having taken little or no 1part in it, but, on the cuotrary, had succoured the wretched sufferers of botip sexes who vrere flying from the ruthless miwreanut who, were Eeekirg their lives. They had, therefore, much moerigghlto attribute the klndly feelings and dispositions of the,natives to the efforts of Christirnn mnislonaries than they had the misfortunes which had arisen to their attempts at conversion. Archdeacon BicKERsThs, who rnoved the first resoluHo, expressive of deep sympathy with the sufferers in India, attributed the outbreak to the fact that, wnder the plea of resecting native prejudices, the Government hax' been hiding Christianity and dishononring God in the sig..e of hesthen By encoain areducation they but undermined the faith of the indoo without ving ' n any better faith in its plce.

WRECK OF ANAMXJICAN SHIP AND NARROW ESCAPE OF THE C.RW. SOUTHAMPTON, OCT. 17. By the arrival at this port to-day of the captain and crew (16 in all) we learn the particulars of the loss of the Richard Anderson, Captain C. E. Coffin, and the narrow eseapE of all on board. The Riehard Anderson was a fall ship, and left Rotterdam for Baltimore on the 29th of August last. On the 23d of September, when in lat. 44.9 N., long. 38512 W., it was found that the vessel had sprung s leak forward, and several hands were immediately put to the pumps. The wa.er continued to increrse for several days, notwithstand. ing the pumps were kept going continually day and night, and the crew got quite worn out. On the morning of the 27th moderate breezes set in from the southwest, which increased during the afternoon alnd evening to a hurricane, and at 8 p.m. the maiDtopsail waS hlown away. At 9.30 p.m. the ship heeled over suddenly, and on going below It was found that the lower hold was half full of water and all the cargo adrift, the ship at this time lying on her beam ends. The main spanker was brailed up and the forward sails set to try to get the ship off before the wind, but they could not get any canvas to stand the hurricane. At 10.30 p.m. the mizenmast was cut awaT, and at 11 the mainmast was also cut away. At this time the hurricane was at its height, and the ship still lying on her beamends, so that no one ouald get along the decks. The ship rolled heavily, and the pumps were kept going, but with very little effect, the crew being nearly exhausted from their continued labours. The hurricane moderated as the night advanoed, and the morning of the 28th opened with fresh gles and squally, the ship still lying on her beamends. The pumps were getting useless, and the crew continued balig water out of the quarter-hatch with buckets, but could not get much out on account of the cargo being all adrift la thohold. This was contiueddu ngthe day, and at 2 p.m. the gale abated; but the vessel still made more water, and was settling down very fast. At 6 p.m. the longboat was got ready for launching. At 7 they shipped a heavy sea, which carried away the lor gboat and stove a second boat, thus leaving them with only one boat. The ship was roUing very heavily to leeward, and they had to cut away the foremast (the only one leftstanding) to ease her. At midnight, thew eathergetting r.oremoderate, thelastboat was gotreadyfor launchlng,as the ship was stilsettling down in the water, and pumps and baling were rendercd useless. At 9 30 a.m. on the 29th the bo.t was got ready, and the second mate and one man placed in her, but in launchiher she got half full of water, and in passing her rouda the stern of the ship she swamped, and the mate was lost; the otber man was rescued, and the boat righted. In this perilous condition they remained till the following afternoon, when a sail was seen on the starboard bow at 4 o'clock. They hoisted a signal of distress, and as it wavs getting dark showed a lght and burned a tar-barreJ. At 7 p.m. they came within hailing distance, when the orew of the Richard Anderson took to their boat and went alongside tho vessel, which proved to be the bark 'ille de Fecamp, from the banks of Newfoundland. They were taken on board, and the sinking ship abandoned, her state that time leading to the expectation of her capstzing and going down in a very short time. They left her in lat. 41, long. 31-31. On the 3rd of October they felU in with the bark Sir Edward Parry, of and for London, which took them on board, and on the 16th transferred them to the Charlotte pilot-boat, of Weymoutb, where they were landed at 310 p.m. Thence they came on to this plae by rail this morning, and made application to Mr. Thomson, the American consuL The captain, we believe, returns to America by the Arago steauaer on Wednesday, and the crew will be sent home the first opportunity. The Sir Edward Parry is a South Sea whaler, and comes home, we are infosmed, with 300 tons of oil on board, after being out three years and a-half.

The pcice are still prosecuting their researches, and a reward of I 1001. bas beon offered by the Government for the apprehension and conviction of the murderer. A DnATm SCN n MIBN sIsYa pi.-The following from the Examiner gives an account of the execution of Jefferson Gray, for shooting Robert Abernathy, in Pontotoc county, MlississipL With a general hurrah and shouting the crowd mnarched their victim off immediately to the woods. About haif a mile trom the town of Red Land they balted at a hickory tree at the road side, tied a rope around the prisoner's neck, and threw the other end of therope over a limb of the tree. They then gave him a few minutes to say his prayers and speak what he had to say. He first called for a drink of water, which being given to him he said, " they had one end of the rope around his ncek and the other over the limb, but as there was a God in heaven and a hell below he was innocent of the charge against him." Some one then cried out, "Hang him up; he is determined to die with a lie In his mouth." A motion was made to swing him up, wben he cried to hold on ar,d he would confess and tell the whole truth. A little time was given him. He then confessed that he shot Abernathy, that some difflculty had ocourred between Abernathy, Jones, and himself; that he went to Abernathy; in the field, and attacked him on the subject. Abernathy having no gun. acknowledged himself in Gray's power, turned his bak to h to walk off, when be shot himin tie ack. After ke had fired the gun Abernathy exclaimed, "You have killed me, Gray, but I am going to Heaven !i He further stated ihat "no one else wasimplicated in the murder but himself that his wife was a good woman, and he hoped sbe would be taken Care of; thatAbernatby was a goodman, and he believed Was gone to Heaven; as for himsoM he could see *ho flames Of tell blazing under his feet liks dry broom sage." He then prayed awhile, and calleA for some one to pray for him. Whereupon Major Steel%, by requezt o2 the comPany, prayed a very solemn and fervent prayer for the *piritual welfare of the prisoner, and for the sanction o( Heaven upon the'rt proceedings, the most respectful order and silence beiD g observed by the crowd during the prayer.

IrztzPATd COLLSroy ON THE $oi7tH W SALS I BAILWA Y. NEABTI, Ocr. 19. nae inqueet ou the body of Satrh Ann Harnter *as resumed this morning before Mr. Catlibertson, coreer for Glamoranshire, at the Town-halL 3Mr. Tripp anD llr. Cottenham, of London, appeared onr behalf of the oompMny, with Mr. Clarke, the geuernsupere intendent of the line. Thomm Gannell, dkiwr of the down train, which left Cheltenham at 6.30'or thb mornig ofthe collisioi, was the first witneEs caled. Ve deposed that his train arrived at Pyle station at 10 20; being about nine Ininut;es behind time. They wore stopped by a messengerfrom thedirectio, of largn^, who said a tram had broken down at Margum and obstructed the down-line. Witaess propoed to go on icautiously along their ows ine (the down) to the spot, as they could render assistance. The paengers, how. ever, said that the guard of the goods tramin bad ordered that nothing was to come oD until further orders, on which witness said, "Then, I've dbne.'r They were detined at Pyle an hour and 18 minutes, when Mr. White, the stationmnnster of Stormy, camne down, and aid witnes was to book his trin up the down line to Stormiy. Witness asked him if he had given instructions to stop everythingcomnag down and he replied that he had. Witness then aked br.White for a written order to go back and retu or. the wp line, and Mr. White said he would give it him at Stormy. Witness, however, required that he should have it before he moved the regulator, and Mr. White then gave him one in pencil, which wVs exchanged on their geettag to Stormy for an order in ink. At Stormy, afteJr few miinutes' delay, Mr. White got on the englne t' act as pilotman, and they then prooeeded don the up line from Stormy toardwt Pyle. They went cautiously down the bank, butrdid nat saop at- Pyle. Had pased Pyle, and as he was proeeeding, along be rw some steam at a distanoe before hit of about half a mile. Could not see on which line of raile the engine from whilh the steam proceeded was running, but called to the fireman to " hold on," in order that they might be sure. XIn a second or two he reversed his engine end blew the guard's whistle from that tbne until the collision took pl ce. Itwas thez about a quarter pust 12 o'dock. When at Pyle statioi, before backing at Stormy, Mr. White told witness that hbehid had a telegraphic message from Port Talbot, directing that the down train sh ould proceed on the up line to- Port Talbot. Heard no conversation at Stormy. By Mr. Tripp.-As they passed Pyle the second time the messenger from Port Talbot give the signal with hi hand "all right," and he then made bimself sare he was rkiht, and had wonfidence. It was after that he saw the steam of the approaching up train. John Days, policeman at Stormy station, heard of the obstruction by the breaking down of the good strain atabout a quarter to 11 o'clock. Was in the office when the tele. graph message arrived from Port Talbot some time after U o'clock asking if the down train had left. EHe was sent into the office by Mr. White; the bell wa not " on." It ought to be on. It was on when the Irish goods was tele' graphedat Bsidgend. Was not in the offie after unttl senI by Mr. White. His answer to the Port Â¶albot inquiry Wa that the down train had not come back from Pyle. Was told by Sr. White to ask at Port Talbot whetner it would be right for the dow n passenger train to go on the up line. This was before Mr. White went to Pyle. Was telegraphing the inquiry and had got as far as "Is right to send down," when Mr. White came in, and witness told him how far he had got with his message, and that he had not made them Aunderstand his message yet. They had given him signals that they could not understand him. Mr. White then took the instraument out of witness's hands, bat witness could not say whether he sent a message or not, but heard him tele. graphing. Did not receive any message from Port Talbot, " Send down train from up line," nor any other message than what he had stated. Mr. White did not tel him that he bad received amy such message. As Mr. White was leaving the office to go with the train towards Pyle heard him gLve directions to some person to " telegraph to Port Talbot that eown train had now left on up hue to Port Talbot. Gardner, the forem%n, came to the door, and said the order was that Davy was to take the telegraph and witnessto gointothe yard. By Mr. Trtpp.-There was no necessity for attaching the bell to the telegraph while any person was in the office, as his attention would be attracted to the instrument, if at work, without it. Before Mr. White gave him the orders to telegraph the under guard of the down train, who had come back from Pyle and had seen Mr. White, said he believed his train was to go d,wn on the up lire. Darint, the time Mr. White was rbsent at Pyle witness was not out of the c,ffice, and wa3 endeavouring most of the time to telegraph to Port Talbot. When he first " called" Port Talbot it was not answered, but it was answered afterwards. Had a good m any signals that they did not understand him, but he got with his message as far as the word '- down," which he believed they understood, but could not get them to aunderstand further. Was using the single-needle instrument. The sigle-needle instrument was put up last Auast, and wvitness had been instructed in its use by Mr. White, and had used it most of the time stuce. By the Jury.-The single-needle instrument which he uced was only connected with Porb Talbot, Stormy, and Bridgend. Mr. Clatrke here explaimed that the single-needle instrament was totally unconnected with any other, and that a message from Bridgend could not interrupt a message between Port Talbot and Stormy. By the Jury.-Did not hear Chapman remonstrating with Mr. White for sending the train on the up line. By Mr. Tripp.-Was not in the ofiice from 9 or holf-past until Mr. White sent him there before he went to Pyle. Davy was afterwards at the telegraph, and said the up train had left Port Talbot. Witness then told him to stop everything. The down train had then left for Pyle, and it was useless to send any one after it. William Davy, porter at Stormy, deposed that at 11.64 he received instructions from Mr. White to telegraph to Port Talbot. His instructions were- Davy, try and let Port Talbot know that we have lefton theup line." Wi-tness proceeded to telegraph, and had got as far as " Down passengers," when the telegraph man at Port Talbot stopped him by a message saying, 'IJp passengers now left." : his was at 11.58. Did not hear Mr. Chapman remonstrate with Mr. White for sending the down train on the L- line. Eeceived the message from Port Talbot on the s'nle needle instrument, the same as that on which he was trying to send the message to Port Talbot. When be received this message from Port Talbot, that the up paEsenger train had left, the down train had left Stormy four minutes. Called Port Talbot several times on the double needle instrument after the message, but could not make them understand. In the couihe of the inquiry the following rules, applying to " accidents and obstructions on the line," were read, as bearing upon the case:- " Rule 23.-Wben a train is stopped on It, jin rsey by an accident, or from any cause other than the regular stoppage at the stations, the guar ft tbere be nly one, or the under guard, if tmer be wo or more, bhah immediately go back with danger signals to atop any coming train: and shall, In addition to bli hand signaX take his detonator and fases ignals.

Ba let mea et benisunde,stood Although I think it:very probable that this wasmade the pretext for rebellion, I 8rzmly believe,- that- mnsny who were otberwise loyal soldiers were seduced from their allegiance by this means, and were really made to believe that the use of these cartridges-was to be forced upon them to destroy their religion. In fact, there seems tohave been a delusion almost amounting to insamity, which no effort on the part of the authorities could possibly have prevented. baÂ±.y are the causes to uhich the rebellion has been attributed-the conduct of European officers, the centralization of authorityi depriving commanding officers of the power of rewarding.or punish. ag,theunwise abolition of coporeal punishment in the native army while it remained as- a custom in the Eur army, on the plea that it iould interfere to preventh caste men from entering into the army. Some, again, say that it was a movement against the missionaries- but I am bappy to say that, neither in private nor official sources,-is there the slightest trace that such was the case. The mis- smonaries were, generally speaking, not obnoxious to thenatives; they passed blameless and self-denyinglives, and have sown much good seed in Inda, from which-I. have.r3o doubt much good fruit will hereafter be produced, Bat, in justice to those holy men (with many of whom I. am acquainted), I must say that the revolt was- clearlynot directed against them, because, if so, they would have become the especial objects of vengeance vhile (as has been happily observed) the outbroek-hiszbeen the strongest where no mlssioiay ever resided-; and although, unfortunately, some few. of them have fallen, it - has been In general a massacre of Europeans. Anotber - party, taking a political Tiew of the case, say that these terrible evenuts originated in the yearning ofthe Mussnlmans to recover their lost dominion; but'whether that yeareing, excited the revolt, or Whether the revolt excited the yearning, does not appear. At all events, it is perfectly clear that such a feeling does exist ; but still this could only be a partial cause, or it would be impossible to account- for- the - fact that the Mussulman princes and population- exhibited very little sympathy with the mutineers. By others the sevolt is attnbuted to what is caled the annexation policy. I do not think that is the case, because those aefected most by that polic7 have not joined the movement, and, with-one slight exception, it would not affect the revolted body. But, whether right or wrong, the annexation policy has been upheld by all parties in this oountryi and the only party who on more tha n one occasion resisted and opposed it was the East India Company, as- the Parliamentary records of 1843 and 1844 will prove. These-are some of the causes which may have eontributed to this outbreak; but, at the same time, I think it behoves persons to approach the subject with reserve and caution, because proper inquiry will be instituted by the auth 'ties wben the present emergency has passed away. The'e is one other cause assigned to which I would allude, tlat the Bast India Company have neglecced their duty of evaRnge. linng the natives. This is a large and wide quetion - but I think that while i'4 is our duty to abstaini from .-ire interference with the conversion of natives to Christianitythat while on the one hand we are bound by treatles and Acts of Parliament to tolerate their forms of vorship so long as they are not opposed to puklio morals, on the otber hand I thilkit is our duty openly to avow our Christian faith, aLd by precept and example to show that we are a Christian natlon, acting upon Christian principles. (Cheers.) What we halve now to ook for is the punishment of those who have so grossly betrayed their trust ; the liberal reward-of -those who have assisted us, particularly those who- have be. friended our countrymen and countrywomen in.-their- distresses. We shall have to reortize our mility force, wbich no doubt muast in the main be dependent upon EBroge"n arms, assisted by native troops, for it wIl be- impo"sible to perform all the duties by Buropeans. By a jsidicious mixture of the two such a force may be-maintained as will prevent for the future the danger from- whioh- I hope we have now almost escaped. In the next session of Parliament the subject will doubtless be amply and fully discussed; a-sd I hope the great Conservative.partywd - approach the subjectthan which none can be of nmore interest both to England and India-in a calm and di-s. passionate spirit, determined to do only what is best for India and to avenge without destroying. That is.the.prnciple we have acted upon and will act upon, I am not pre. pared to defend the system by which IndLia i -at present governed. The East India Company may have commaitted sine of omisson and commision, but, taken as a whole, their rule hba been benefiÂ¢ent and has done.great good to India. Whether any other ystem of government may be devised which would be more beneficia1 I cannot ssa but it certainly would not answer to place the wh ole of tat-vast empire nn(eDr a Secretary of State, assisted by resident' cfiicers."

FOBBIGN IZEYLLIGE2CE. - R AVtWh. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) X portlon of the folowiug appeared in our $ewoid erA S, OCT. 18, S P.m. A private letter fror Stookholm states that Count de Platen has been definitively named to succeed the 3Baron de Hochachild as Minister cf Sweden In London. This aelection is regarded in Sweden with approbation, all the more as it is, at the sama time, the first nominatior under the T'-egency to an important poBt; it is a favourable inauguration of the new rggime, and an earnest of what ulterior appointments wil be. It has added to the populaty of t;he Prince Royal, as well as to that of the Minister for Foreign Affair Count de Platen is described as among the most esteemed memben of the Swedish nobility, and he has always distinguished himself in the Diet by his advocacy of enlightened and liberal measures. He was named Minister of Marine in 1848, but he fUed the post only a short time, owing to political reasons. He began bis career as an officer in the navy, and spent many yer in England, and lived on board the vesels of the Royal navy. Be is a -warm admirer of English character and manners, and has cherished the strongest prediletion for the country. The Countess de Platen is spoken of as a lady distinguished for grace of mauner. She Is the only daughter of the Count de Geer, one of the wealthiest of the Swedish aristocracy. No one at Stockholm doubts that Count de Platen will be welU received in England, and that he will be found to be admirably fitted to continue and consolidate the politcal and comercial relations, as well as the friendly feelings, which have so long subsisted between the two countries. Lord Rowden had a long privaite audience of the Emperor of the French a fewr days ago at St. Cloud. The principal topic of conversation was the pssent state of Spain. 1 am happy to say that the most complete accordance on that sbject between England and Erance was the result. It is to be hoped that the knowledge of this fact will arreat the pernicious designs of the retrograde party in Madrid. The Emperor and Empress left this afternoon for Compiegne, accompanied by the Ministers of Finance, Justice, Foreign Affairs, two or three members of the Diplomatic Body, and some other persons rpecially invited. The legal proceedings before the Correctional Police-court of Colmar, in the department of the Haut-Rhin, and on whic.h the judges are to deliver their decision on Thursday next, are amusing aud instructive. The defendant, M. Jules Migeon, has been prosecuted on various charges, which, in the opinion of the law officers, should disqualify him from taking bis seat in the Legislative Body, to which he has been recently elected, though, perhaps, his greatest offence consists in having obtained a majority of 7,000 votes over the Government candidate. This triumpb, obtained in spite of Prefects and Sub-Prefects, Mayors and Commissaries of Police, and in the very teeth of the central Government, shocked the moral sense of the authorities. We may now conclude that henceforth the Imperial Government wtill visit with severity, in its own functionaries as well as in the representatives of the people, the slightest violation of the laws of virtue and of decency. Vice and fraud among public characters will be put down when detected, aad the man who claims to be intrusted with public functions must previously show that he Is innocent of domestic irregularities, and that, both in public and private, his life is a model of all the virtues. Of this unexpected and violent fit of official moralityM. Migeon has become the first victim. He is tho scapegoat in whose vicarious torture the sins of many are atoned for, and he is held forth as a chastisement and a warning to all delinquents. The charges adduced by the Procureur Imperial against AL Migeon consist in his having, through the instrumentality of his friends and agents, obtained the votes of the electors by the cizculation of " calumnious reports and other fraudulent manceuvres;" of having promised his influence to others towards their obtaining certain employments under Government for the same ob~ject; of having threatened certain eubordinate functionaries with the loss of their pla es it they opposed him; of having s.ttempted to damage the fair reputation o` the higher functionaries in his circulars and addresses to the constituency; of having distributed the said circular wit;hout the uthorization of the superlor authorities, as required by the law; of having worn on certain occasions the decoration of the Legion of Honour and certain foreign orders without being entitled to do so; and of having used offensive language and gestures to a sergeant of Gendarmes and the Mayor of the village of Bermont for something in that functionary's conduct which displeased him. In addition to these grave charges, of which I give the substance, allegations are made against the defendant that he was a gambler on the Bourse, that he had (which I suppose is more heinous) lost a large sum in those speculations, that he had been disinherited by his mother, that he had separated from his wife, that he had been ignominiously excluded from the Petde Bourse, &c. To rebut all, or most of these charges, numerous witnesses were produced on the part of the defendant. Among these were clergymen, retired officers of the army, farmers, peasants, and even subordinate functionaries of the Government. The evidence on both aides is now under examination by the Court, who, as I have said, will pronounce their decision on Thursday. I refrain from offering any opinion as to theculpabiity or innocence of1lLMigeon, but, pcnding the deliberations of the judges, I may observe that these proceedings have painfully affected the public mind, not merely in the large towns but in the remote districts. By the warmest friends of Government this prosecution is considered as a great fault, inasmuch as it has attained an object which could not have been contemplated. The Government meant to prove the "electoral frauds" committed by the opponent of their candidate in the Haut-Ithin, and the authorities are clearly shown to have had recourse to the same manceuvres, the same coercion, as denounced by the law, with a view to secure the election of the Minist isal candidate at Colmar. If the election in question be the criterion of all the deDartmental elections unanimously favourable to the Government, thepublic may naturally doubt the real value of universal suffrage, from which the Inperial regime derives its origin. We may well be surprised at the want of tact on the part of the public functionaries in instituting a prosecution which they must have known was sure to iead to disclosures of so vcry damaging a character to themselves. The most ordinary intelligence mniust have anticipated the deplorable effect that would result, not only from the declarations of the witnesses for the defendant, but from those too which were extorted from the electors and functionaries summoned to depose against him. The Minister of Justice must have been well aware of the means employed by the Prefects and Sub-prefects against a candidate who was so recently the proteg6 of the Government, and with whose demerits it was long since familiar. It was, perhaps, imprudent to commence an attack when the Government was sure to receive more injury than it could inflict, and to employ a weapon which was likely to destroy the hand that wielded it. When it is remembered how earefully, and oftentimes how vexatiously, those who are charged with the censorship of the press prohibit the pub- lcaton or any fact -which would tend to lower the character of official people in public estimation, we are surprised at the publicity which has beea permitted to these scandalous proceedings. That publicity has directed attention to the manner in which elections are conducted in the rural and more distaut localities; and whether the unusual indulgence allowed to the press on the present occasion is the result of indifference or negligence, or the earnest of greater liberty in future, the lesson is useful, and will not, it is hoped, be lost. These " electoral frauds," shown to be comamitted by both parties, prove how hypocritical was the indignation which denounced the first elections in the Danubian Principalities, and the Kaimakan of Mioldavia, when he is again lectured on electoral morality, may point to those of the Hau t-Rhin, and the proceedings at Colmar. If all be true that is alleged against the candidate elected in opposition to the official nominee-that he g4mbled at the Bourse, and that he was an immoral ehvraoter-the Governxment was aware that these disqualifications for admission to the immaculate Cbamber, appropriately presided over by the Count de Morny, existed while M Migeon still enjoyed its favour; and the ooincidence of a prosecation with hi triumph at the ballot-urn justifies the suspicion as to the purity of its motives. M. Migeon, we are told, amassed a fortune by means of Bourse speculations and by the practioe of usury, &ad therefore waa unfitted to be a Deputy; but it Iis akedisn there no one among those in high place3 who has risen suddenly aud unaocountably from comparative indigence to the powesion, or at all events to thed lplay, of great weslth ? E any such there be, will tey be subjeed to the same exposure aa the unfortunatg deputy for the HautP.bin? or will the public bave still reason to say that MX Migeon, even supposing all that has been brought against him true, is merely the whipping boy on whose back far higher transgressors are 'vicariously scourged; and that the present severity of the guardians of public morals in this single instance Is with the view of turing public attention ,from others t The last accounts from Turin state that M. Benedetti, Chief of the PoliticalDepartiment at the French Foreign-office, has left that clty to continue his journey to Central Italy. M. Benedetti is charged with a confidential rleion to inquire into the present situation of Italy. A telegraphic despatch received by the French Governnent through Germany announces that the Prince de Joinville arrived on the 8th of October at SebastopoL M. Christopoulos, the Minister of Public Itruction at Athens, has addressed an interesting communication to the Paris Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres on some curious antiquities which have lately been discovered in Greece. I am Informed that the Austrian Government has forwarded a complaint to the Porte against the Intrigues which it s said have been practised in the Rouman provinces of its empire by a certain member of the Liberal party who obtained a majority at the elections in Wallachia. The Marquis de Isle de Siry, French Minister to the Court of Lisbon, who has been some tlne in Paris on leave of absence has been commanded by the Emperor to return to hia post. He left Paris today, accompanied by the Duke de Belluno, Secretary to the Mission. He proceeds to Rochefort, where he will embark on board the steam corvette Coligny, placed at his disposal to convey him to PortugaL A letter from Brest of the 15th inst. Informs us that on the 9th a ship, supposed to be three-masted, and of 300 tons, foundered with all her crew at the south-west point of the island of Uishant. A planl%, on which the name " Symmetry" is Inscribed In gat characters, and a strip of the English flag, have been found on the shore, and leave no doubt as to the deplorable fact. Some broken pieces of raisinboxes, on which are written the name " Vincent Gaboila, Dlenia," part of a mizenmast, and a dead body have likewise been washed ashore. Twelve bills of lading, three charterparties, and 48 letters, which belonged to thhe English sloop Adventure, of 59 tons, Captain Crispin, were found on the coast near Conquet. According to these papers the vessel waa laden with Spanish wine. Accounts fromRochefort announce that the steam sloop Pregent sailed for the island of Bourbon on the 15th inst., on her way to reinforce the French fleet in the China Seas. The ateam frigates Imp6ratice Eugdnie and Impetueuse anchored in the port of the Jollette at Marseilles on the 15th inst., bringing the 54th and 68th Regiments of Infantry from Algiers. The Mo^miteu4r AlIgerie contains the following order of the day published by General Renault on the occasion of the departure ef these regimnents: ")ead-qu%rters, Algiers, Oct. 9. "The Emperor has decided that the 54th, 60th, and 68th Regiments of the Line shall return to France, together with the 18th battalion of Riflemen. The Governor. General ad inlterim cannot suffer these brave regiments to embark withou taking leave of them, and recording the services they have rendered. "The 54th diiguished itself during the campaign In the south of the province of Oran, in 1854, in December, 1855, and January, 1856; during the expeditions to the frontiers of Morocco In June and July, 1856, and In Great Xabylis in 1857; the 60th, at the siege and capture of IAghoust, in 1852, during the campaig of Kabylia in 185, during the expedition against the Beni-Ouagnenoun in 1855, during the campaign against tho tribes of the Valley of Boghni in 1856, and during the compalgn in Great Kabylia in 185T; the 68th, during the expedition against the Benl-Shasen of Morocoo in 1852, at Djebel-Frlma, and during the campaign of the Babors in 1853, in the Valey of Bogbni in 1856, and In the campaign In Great Kabylia in 1857; the 18th battaUon of Riflemen during the operations against the tribes of the Valley of Boglnl i 1856, and the campaign of Great Kabylla in 185't. "During a period of repose those regiments have given an example of ardour for labour by completing important works of oolonizatlon. Go, soldiers, and show yourselves the worthy representatives of that army which is about to continue that work for the accomplishment of whioh you have so gloriously laboured." A private letter from Trebizonde, of the 29th of September, informs us that the Commissioners appointed to define the boundary between Russia and Turkey In Asia have arrived at the following conclusion :-The celebrated lake of Balouk Gueul, situate in Armenia, to the south of Mount krarat, of wvhich the half was claimed by Russia, has been doelared to belong entirely to Turkey. The strategic road from Koudjak-Guetchit has been roetified near EBaysid, and a point has been fixed where the boundary between the two countries is to be established. A tract of land at Gouriel, of about eight leagues in circumference, claimed by both parties, has been divided, and the watercourse of Teholok has been declared as the limit between the two States. Every matter is now so clearly defined that any future dispute will be impossible. PRtISSTA. (FRoM OUR OWiN coRsroND-ENT.) BERLIN, OcT. 17, It has been my lot, within the last faw months, to report to you of two Kings, both distinguished among the most remarkable men of the present day for high mental qualites, having become disqualifled by bodily illness for the further conduct of public affairsviz., the King of Sweden and the King of Prussia. The former has been remarkable for extensive reading, enlightened wisdom, and strong clear sense in the practical solution of actual difficulties; the latter for brilliant intellect, cultivated taste, wide-seeing, high-soaring views, and fervent zeal for the spread of religion and peace. Both have been reduced from their high level of mental superiority, and must content themselves to resign for a time the exercise of that sovereign power which they considered the highest attribute conferred on them from above, and which they held it to be a divine right to wield. The illness of the King of Sweden showed itself first this spring, and, as far as has become known at this distance, consisted of little more than excessive debility; in June he proceeded to take the benefit of sea-bathing in S5ro, but returned from there without having derived the advantage desired. His physicians have officially declared their unanimous conviction that "liberation from all ment exertion in an indispensable condition of the King's regaining his lost health." And in answer to the question how long this state was likely to last, they have offlcially decared "the ng mustor at least a year, be exempted from the fatigues that the conduct of the government entails upon him, if he I to regain his healt"' In neither the case of the King of Sweden nor that of the Kng of Pussia is there any indication of insanity, but imply a giving way of the bodily strength, and, in consequence, a weakening, not an aberration, of the mental powers On September 11. the ombined Swedish and Norwegian Privy Council, under the guidance of the King, enacted that an interim Government, com- posed of an equal number of Swedes and Norwegians, should be immediately organized, and the members nominated and summoned. A proposition has been subsequently submitted by the King to the Estates of Sweden and Norway, that the Crown Prince of Sweden, who was at that time performing the functions of Viceroy of Norway, should assume the Regency of the united kingdoms; and this proposition was accepted and made law September 25. After transacting such business as was imperatively necessary in Stockholm, the Crown Prince Regent set off for Christiania, where he was to close the Storthing on the 15th of this month; and for the term of his absence from Sweden the powers of the Regent have been put into commission. In the meantime nothing further is heard officially of the progress of the King's reovery, and all that trans- pires is, that he is gradually, but very slowly gaining atrength from his present state of repose a tranquillity, The illness of the King of Pria is of too recent a date to admnit of any arrangementsl being as yet made in connexionl with the conduct of publio ment at albigarvda ~eiy l apprthensoso nutml n ae ti true, for the present removed; nor are there as yet any indications which necesarily imply that the King will for Any lengthened period_yar for more than a year-be unable to devote himself to business; but there are also just as few kdicatlons that he will recover rapidly enough to Mupersedo the necessity of some provisional form of government being instituted. The decision that has beea come to by MinisterB, in conformity with the straightforward and manly answer which the Prince of Prussia communicated to them on Saturday, in reply to their summons to amsunie the management of public busines in hi brother's narae, is, that H{is Majesty shall be advised formally to empower hix brother to administer the affairs of the kingdom until he is completely recovered; and, as I hear, the Queen has been in possedsion of the document to be signed by the Kian for that purpose since last Tuesday, with a view to her introducing the subject to him at the first favourable moment. The arrangement is of the most pressig urgency to the State5 inasmuch as in each minisier-unm or branch office of the Government the accumulated busines of thr.ee months lies piled up waiting for the Royal pleasure and sign-manual, a vast number of, Interests in the State at large are being prejudiced by the delay, and the Ministers are prevented from taking thetr measures of preparation for the next sesion of the Diet, which must be summuoned early in January. The King's state, however, does not 'as yet admit of so grave a subject being submitted to him; he in unaware how long or how seriously ill he has been ; his memory is only slowly returning to him, and he frets extremely at his inability to find the fitting expressions for the ideas that recur to him. The political dilemma is, that the King is not ill enough, or ha not been long enough ill1 to admit of the Regency being introduced de jure In virtue of the C.harter, and at the same time is not strong enough to have the subject of empower. Ing his brother to act in his place laid before him; and a further dilemma to be looked forward to s this, that as soon aa he is well enoughl to take this subject into consideration he may feel so convinced of his immediate and entire recovery as to refuse to adopt any such measure a- all. The medical dilemma is, that while the Zing's present tate of debility is so great as to render his reconvalescence painfully slow, the phy. sicians are deterred from giving him any tonics from the certainty of superinducing a renewed rush of blood to the brain, from which fatal results might be apprehended. The bulletin which wa published yesterday was as follows:- 4'The Kings stae of helth offered yesterday severa gratifying symptoms of gradually progressve improvement. His Majesty pased last night also in tranquil and refreshlig sleep. " Sans Soud, Oct. 16, 9 o'lock a" The real state of the case was, that though, doubtless, the august patient is gaining some strength from rest and quiet his state during that day approached closely to stupor; he can walk a little about the room with the help of a servant, and at times utters lucid remarks, but is incapable of a sustained conversation, from his, inability to recollect or to clothe his ideas in fitting expresslons, which to one formerly so remarkable for felicity of expression is doubly painful and highly irritating. In the night of the 7th to the 8th inat. the King lay for two hours motionless, senseless, and breathless, so that the Queen and the Dowager Duchess of MecklenburgSchwerin, his sister, who were sitting up with him, were almost driven to believe his spirit had actualy departed, the more so as the brightest light held before his eyes produced no effect upon them, while in life he is peculiarly and painfully affected by light. It was at this juncture that thePrince of Prussia wfas sent for in all haste, and he immediately summoned all the other members of the Royal family by telegraph. UJntil to-day the Prince of Pruseiabas, I behoeve, hardly left Sans Souci since he was that night called thither, but he has not as yet been admitted to speak with the King, in spite of all the improvement that we read of in the bulletins. The last document bearing thatname appeared this morning, and states :-"The course of His Majesy's illness during the last four-and-twenty hours was, considering <she ciroramstances, satisfactory." Now that your readers have learnt from me what " the circumstances" are, they will not permit the adjective "satidaotory" to mixlead them into too sanguine expectations. The Princess of Prussia w remain at Coblentz until some decision is come to with reference to the Prince's assuming the administatlon of public affairs; whenever that is the case he will, in all probability hoe and reside for a time 3n the Royal I C1F ere, where he will then be joined by the Princess. Prince Frderick William has been compelled by his unele@s illness to give up, for the pre3snt, his journey to England, where he had intended to spend his own birthday (the 18th inst.) Whether he will be able to be present at our Court to spend there the Princess Royal's birthday (Nov. 20) is also at present problematical. The Emperors of Aushia and. Ruskinform themselves daily by telegraphof the progres of the King's recovery; and the Pope desired the Prussian nister at Rome to express, by telegraph, his warmest wishes for His Majesty. The Emperor of R,Ussia has even sent General Count; Adlerberg from Warsaw to Potadam; and the Empress-Mother has also sent thither Prince Gagarin from St. Peterburg, for the purpose of their being kept repeatedly and correotly informed of the state of thelr uncle and brothers health. The Minister-President feels now at liberty to leave Potsdam for considerable portions of a day at a time, and almost daily Ministerial Councils are held here. AUSTRI. (]mom oun ow CoRnsWPoNDWzrr.) VIENNA, OcT. 16. In my letter of the 14th inst. mention was made of tha discovery of a plot to take the life or to over throw the Government of the Iospodar of Servia, and it is now in my power to give some details on the subject At noon, on the 9th inst., M. Damjanovitch, a senator, who was once Minister of the Interior, was arrested as he was returning from the senate-house in Belgrade to his own residence, an i at the same time M. Martzajlowitch, a very infla ential man in Belgrade, was seized by the police while taking refreshment In an inn. On the same day M Paul Jankovitch, who was formerly Minister of Finances, was arrested at Semendria and taken to the Servian capital, where he was immediately cast into prison. Many other persons of less note were also put under lock and key by the police. The Servian Government i said to have documentary evidence in hand that the persons who were arested on the 9th inst. had cognizance of a conspiracy, the object of which was the assaesination of the Hospodar. In the evening of the 8th inst. a fire broke out opposite the palace of the Prince and au attempt on his life would probably have been made if he had gone into the street to assist in extinguishin It.. Some 30 or 40 haystacks were con- I sued by iire in the evening of the following day. but no other property of value was destroyed Already on the 7th of October the Belgrade correspondent of the Ost Deutche Post wrote that thera were vague rumours in circulation of a plot having been formed against the Hospodar, and he also alluded to secret meetings "held by the lntelligenee of the principality" in the house of the Prefect o0 Semendria, who is known to be a most zealous partisan of the Russian Government. It is averred that Prince Daniel of Montenegro Is in intimate correspondence with the Sclavonic agitators in the Turkish provinces in Europe. and it is I probable that he knows as much of what is pasaing in Servia as the chief of the Belgrade police. For some time past the ruler over the Montenegrins has been intent on directing the attention of the Sclaves to the fact that the Hospodar of Servia is merely a vassal of the Porte while he is an independent Prince. The ambitioa. little potentate seems to wish to accustom the Sclavonic races i Turkey to look upon him as their natural leader, but Austria keeps a watchful eye o l his movements, and wvi not fail to call him to order if he should go beyond his tether. As soon as Mustapha Pasha of Scutari received the order of the Porte not to molest the inhabitants of Wasojevitz he withdrew his troops, and hardly had he turned his back when Mirko Petrovich, the President of the Montnegrin Senate, marched 50) men into the "N ahie" (district), and Incorporate I it with what is xnow called the Principality Berda.* The Consuls of Austria, France, and Enganc have prote-sted against the measure, but the Montenegr-in * The four "BErdas" are Bielopavici, Pperi4 Rovatsk Mlorataks, and Kut8ka. Prince appoars to care As attle for the one Power as for the other. The Montenegrin Senate has confiscated the property of the convents, and in future the "popes" will be paid by the State. The Archimiandrite of Ostrog was so perscuted that he fled to Dalmatia, and went from that Austrian province to Rusia. The Volksfreund learns from Cattaro that Prince Daniel has created three dukes during the last fortnight, and the writer expresses lii belief that his ighness has taken the Emperor 8ououque for his modeL Some of the organs of the French pres have recently stated that the opinion of the Austrian GoVernment in respect to the union of the Danubian Principalities has undergone a great change but reliable information has reached me that such s not the case. The Vienna Cabineti not likelyto object to a oomplete assimilation of the institutaons of the two principalities, but it will never agree to their plical union under the rule of a foreiga Prince. It is even related that this Government has recently, by means of a note, expresed its entire approval of the circular in which the Porte declared itS resolve not to permit the Divans ad hoec to meddle with the union question. Tho Catholic hierarchy havlng discovered that the ecclesiastical courit are very expensive propows to cover the outlay by imposmg a tax on persons who marry but neither the Cabinet nor the Council of the inmpire is likely to approve the scheme. Rome, as you are well aware, has many friends in the highest cireles, but I much doubt whetiler any of them would have the courage to propose to His Majesty to permit the clergy to impose and levy a new tax in his dommiuons. The priests will naturally have their fees and dues whenever they perform the marriage ceremony, but the State will take care that they do not make any unreasonable demands on the weckets of the lioges. Rome has the conscienees of the Austrians in her keeping, but fortunately their stong boxes are not at her disposal. Instructions are said to have been sent to the Vienna papers not to make any mention of Eugene Sue, of EenryEHeine, of the Protestants in Itria, a;ndof Prince Metternich'a work on Rungay; but the whole story must be a mystification, for the authorities who have to do with the press would never commit such a mistake as to place the productions of the pen of the ex-Chancellor of State on a level with those of Messrs. Sae and Heine. *L de Walewski, an Ultramontanist, residing at Cracow, has just published a work in which he seeks to prove that the present system of government-that of strict centralization-is not likely to conduce to the wellbeing and development of Austria. Not long since one of the superior employts in the General Bookkeeping and Central Office had an audience of the Emperor, and communicated to him certain facts which induced His Majesty to 1ssue orders that the department in question should be subjected to a striet examination. The whole affair is kept so very quiet that it has until now been impossible to obtain any reliaable information as to the result of the examination. Excesses have recently been committed by the peasanta at Dembica, in the district of Tarnow, in Galicia. The peasants who were "expropriated" by the authorities, it . rder that the Galician Railway might be constructed, fancy that they have suffered a great wrong, and endeavour to avenge themselves by setting fire to the property of those persons whom they believe to have injured tbem. Such an unusual number of fires occurred that the suspicions of the authorities were excited, and some peasants were arrested. The friends of these men assembled, and after having declared that the railroad workmen and their employer were the authors of the numerous fires, they proceeded to the house of the director of the works and endeavoured to force their way into it. As tbe authorities at Dembica were unable to persuade the excited peasats to return quietly to their homes, the asistance of the Gendarmerie was demanded by telegraph from Tarnow. A detachment of Gendarmes was inmnedately Eent, and peacoe and order were restored, but hardly without loss of life. No ditails of what occurred after the arrival of the armed force have yet reached this city. The concluding words of the sentence by means of which the Pope ratified the Concordat with NVurtemberg were-" We declare that everything which may be done by any one-whatever may be his rank or position-that is not in keeping with these stipulations shall be null and void. Therefore no human being is allowred to act contrary to these presents, which have received our approval, acceptatlon, confirmation, and ratification. But if any one should venture to do so, be it known unto him that he will incur the auger of God the Almighty, and of his holy; Apostles Peter and Paul." The text of the Wurtemberg Concordat has not been published by the i Papal Chair, and it must therefore, be supposed that it is infinitely less advantageous for Rome than tbat which His Holiness two yarar ago concluded with the Emperor Francis Joseph. On the 12th trains ran between Milan and Venice, but there was no official ceremony. Yesterday a part of the Junction Railroad was opened here, and the goods train from Trieste went directly up to the Custom-house. That part of the Junction Rairoad which is to connect theCustom-house withtheNorthem Railroad is not likely to be completed for some time to come. Odessa firms have offered to sell the Austrian ironfounders the English and French cannon balls which were collected at Sebastopol at a low price.

Joseph Ressel, the director of one of the departments of the Austrian Admiralty. AL Reesel, in the year 1827, took out a patent here " for the use of a screw instead of paddle-wheels in steamvessels." As M. Resel could not find any one who would purchase his patent, and he could not afford to pay the annual tax, he was obliged to renounce his claim to it. TURKEY. (FROM OURP OWN COERRSPONDFUNT.) CONSTANTINOPLE, OcT. 10. Turkey is again in her yearly, at least once recarring teething period,-the formation, namely, of a new Ministry, and it seems more painful and critical than usual; nothing but old stumps loose, or pressing each other too closely, and some rather hard nuts to crack for any new set. The Ministers themselves seem to have no confidence in their own future, and no one is willing to put himself forward in such a critical position for tear of ruining his political prospects, You see, therefore, just at this moment the curious phenomenon that among al place-greedy Turks no Grand Vizier is to be found. Old Mustapha has been placed and kept there for form's sake, and he would be the most convenient man for most of the Ministers, as they could do under his r7lle whatever they pleased. ut circumstances are such that: some ng better than a good-natured old gentleman; I is required at the head of the Government. Of the and Ash Pasha-the first sees that he is Impossible, at any rate now; the second has declared that he would on no account accept the post of Grand Vizier; and the third remembers too well his last Government to put himself in that ungrateful situation, where he had all the blame and no power. They are all three of them too clever to be ciphers, and to sacrifice real power for the bare name of it; and neither of them has authority and weight enough either in the country or over his colleagues to become a Grand Vizier in the full sense of the word. There was some chance of 1ibrisli Pasha being put forward as sign-post, but since his patron, Fethi Ahmed Pasha, is in disgrace, his chances have considerably diminished. But, more than anything else, it is the financial crisis which makes people cautious not to compromise themselves. As I said in my last, it is not the public Treasury which is in such a bad state, but the civil list. When Redaschid Pasha was still in power there were various projects to pay off the debts of the civil list and palace, and the estimate which was made out showed that they amounted to about 4,000,0001. sterling. Now, for the greatest part of these debts aninterestof from 15to 20 percent. must be paid; and, as nobody w.ould lend any snore money, the general revenues of the counltry had to supply more than they onght to haFve done, and aoe,800,0001. of debts; te are200001. Tenew issue of paper.money was uominally for these two departments, but they have only received-the War Departtnent about 40,00Z., and tho Marine little more than 15,0001.; and yet 75,000,000 piastre,, or about 5u0,000i., have been issued in paper according to the declaration of the Government, and it is atrongly suspected that more will be yet issued without any declaration at all. Qaery, what has become of tne rest of the money gone to relieve the pressing, wrants of the civil list, which has exhausted all other means to meet the daily growing wants of the palace. Nobody Will lend any more except against jewels and plate, and most of this has been already pawned, and nobody dares to oppose himself to the extravagance, which never was greater than at this present moment. Any new Ministry will have to grapple with this financial monster. It must be done, and every one feels this and loses courage. Rumour has been rife therefore, for the last few daysiof Redachid's and Ahmed Vefik Effendi's return to the Ministry, and there can be no doubt that it must end there; but nothing -would be more regrettable than if Redschid's return was too prceipitate. The suddenness of his return to power last time was one of the causes vhich weakened his position. He took the reins of Government without having obtained guarantees from the Sultan which would have freed and strengthened his hands, and without which he can do just as little as the rest. His advantage is just that, if anybody, he can obtain these guarantees from the Sultan, with wrhom he is nowr more in favour than ever, and then his prestige is such that he can keep unruly politial sm.31tÂ£on3 in check, and that he will always be master in the Ministry in which he sits. One of the most efftcient instruments to check the power of absolute Sovereigns has always been thelr stress of money,which seems their chronic complaint. Wby should the population of Turkey, which will bave ultimately to pay the debts of the Court, not derive some benefit likewise by their means 7 The pledge of the Sultan to be satisfied heneeforth with his splendid civil list, making about ans-eighth of the present revenue-a pledge that the number of functionaries will not be doubled by the nomination of palace favourites to rich sinecures created for them-these would be advantages which would not be too dearly purchased by paying the 4,000,0001. or 5,000,000Q. sterling to which the palace debts amount. Turkey at the present moment has little or no chance of obtaining this or any other sum by direct negotiations in Europe; she must again, as soon as a new Ministry is formed, begin negotiations for a bank to help her out. The repeated failures in this respect have had one good effect, and that is to sober down pretensions. The Turks begin to see that without European help they cannot get out of the maze, and that they must come dovwn with their terms if they really do wish to deal with serious people. They must make sacrifices and pay for the financial disorder which they have let go on for years and years. But no sacnifice can be too great to get out of the present disorder, which is like a clog on the start which material progress would takejust now ; for in vain do the revenues increase, they are absorbed like water in a desert of sad. For instance, this year the revenues have increased by almost 800,0001. sterling, which is no small sU1m, considering the whole revenue last year was only 7,500,0001. The more that comes in the more is squandered away and turned from its destination. A Government, even if purchased at a high price, by having the payments in its hands and by publishing its transactions would be the best and, I think, indeed the only check which could be found against all malpractices. Every one in England must be anxious about the Indian telegraph; some information about the projected land line to Bussora will therefore be welcome to your readers, although it may prove that the Government at bome is not quite so anxious as they. I need not refer to that part of the transaction which passed in England about a telegraph line from Seleucia to Bussora It was a scheme saugested by the Euphrates Valley Railway, and the Mediterranean line in connexion with it was to have been carried out by an Austrian company. The Goverment having promised the jubsidy the Turkish concession was to be obtained, and 1Y Zohrab,' late Turkish Consul-General in London, and Mr. Staniforth were intrusted by the company with the negotiations. Pedschid Pasha, who was then still Grand Vizier, took up the scheme, and all the preliminary steps which are required to bring the matter before'the Tanzim-atthe Council charged with theinquiryinto all these Idnd of project,-were soon made. But just on account of this support on Redschid's side the project was ratber hostilely viewed by this Council, whose President waa then, as he is now, at deadly feud with the late Grand Vizier. The objection then raised was that the Turkish Government could not guarantee the protection of the line from Seleucia to Bussora through the Desert. In vain did the negotiators for the company maintain that they did not require any such protection from the Government. The Tanzimat Council firmly maintained its opinion that it would be dangerous to give such a concession, for if anything occurred, whether pledged or not pledged to the protection of the line, the company might always come down on the Turkish Government for damages. The project was not accepted, Redschid was determined, however, to have the project carried, and he would have brought it before the Ministry in spite of its rejection by the Tanzimat had not the recent complication intervened and prevented his doing so. He resigned his post of Grand Vizier, and went as President to the Council of the Tanzimat. The negotiators for the telegrapheompany, encouraged bythis, brought their project again before this Council, and were this time successful in obtaining the sanction and recommendation of the Tanzimat. The next step was to bring it before the Couneil of Ministers, which was done by Redschid, as President of the Tanzimat. It found very little support, but iu the beginning, likewise, no opposition, till at last Fuad Pasha took the matter up and declared himself directly against the scheme. He maintained that it was against the principle on which telegraphs have been hitherto established in Turkey; that it had been from the beginning the wish of the Government to take all telegraphs in the country into its own hands, and not to make it an affair of private undertaking; he was therefore against the scheme for this reason; and he ended with the proposition that the Government itself ought to establish a line of telegraph from Scutari through Asia Minor, down to Bagdad and Bussora, employing the engineers, buying the materialof the company, andcoming to an understanding with the British Government about the transmission of their messages to Bussora, and the connexion of the line from there to Kurrachee. The proposition was too reasonable not to be accepted by the Council of Ministers, and they all agreed in it. The new projected lint, from Constantinople right across country removei the great difficulty of passing the desert shores of the Euphrates, exposed to the Arabs, which is in the present state of thin.s there a fatal obstacle to any line across from Seleucia. It would spare the British Government and the Eajst India Oompany the yearly subsidy of 12,0001., and the line caunreckon on more security if the Government is interested in it than If it was in the hands of a private company, which would have to act through the petty local authorities in the far out of the way districts. The proposition was telegraphed home, and obtained the consent of the Government, and the negotiations about the details began again at the Tanilmat, whose President Fuad now is. It is but justice to say that he bebaved in the most liberal way. There was to be one wire exclusively for English Government messages, worked by Englishmen, and the whole line was to be construoted by them. A separate convention with the British Government was to regulate the tariff and other details, and things had proceeded so far that the negotiators were empowered Ito telegraph to their employers that everything was arranged as regards the construction of the line, when a couple of days ago the British Government sent a message to the effect that it could have nothing to do wth a line from Constantinople direct overland to Bussora. This is very much to be regretted. It is suspected that the reason of this refusal is a convention concluded with some Austrian company for laying the cable across the Mediterranean. Whatever thereason is, it will throw back the chances of a telegraph to India. The Turks want to have the telegraphs in their own hand. Right or wrong, they will not easily give in. They know the absurdity of a SeleuciaBussora line, and proposed therefore another through Asia'Minor, and then direct down the Tigris, where it can be protected, and the Government at home refuse to treat, although it would cost them nothing. It this line is not accepted, there wil a difficulty to get another, for the Turks will not easily give permission. to laud the cable in Alexandria or any other place in Egypt; or, ait any rate. it will be some time before they can be made to consent to any other line. If the British did not with to have a telegraph line soon to India this would be the way to succeed. ITALY.

THB STATE OF CALIFORNIA. (FROM OUR OWN COMMPoWDXNWr- SAN FRANCSCO, I33rT. 4. The State elections were held on the 2d inst. The candidates repreaented the party organizations of Democrats, Republicans, and America. There in no doubt the Democrats have carried the State. and that they wMi have a large majority in botn branches of the next Legialature. Ir. Weller is the Governor elect. He has for several yeanbeen one of the Senators for CaliforniaatWashington. TheAinerican (or Know-nothing) candidate for Governor wAs well supported, having run far ahead of his opponent of the Republican colour; but the Democratic vote nearly equaled the other two, showing pretty clearly the complexion of the StaWs politics. in fact, California hag always been Democratic. In San Francisco, on the other hand, in the election for city officers the people's party, which sympathizes with the Viglance Committee, has beaten the Democrats. The eleotion pased off very quietly, the villanies of former elections having been kept 'down by a large attendance of the repectable voters, who for once took a personal interest in the proc eeviings. The question to be decided by this election which excis the greatest interest abroad is that of payment or repudiation of the public debt of California. The electors in fsvour of payment were to vote "Pay the debt," and those against payment, "Repudiate the debt." Ax soon after the election as news was received from the interior the impression becane general that the vote for payment was in the ascendant, and a great many are still very confident that such is the case. Some of to-day's newspapers say, "There is undoubtedly a majority in favour of paying the State debt." In fact, busines arrangements have been predicated upon this result for some time back, and all the outstanding bonds, &c., have beea bought up on speculation in anticipation of itfor parties in Washington chiefly. It s proper for me to state, however, distinctly that the result is not yet known, and cannot be known until all the election returns come inh which will not be for eight or 10 days. All calculations upon the matter are speculative. As public feeling will have it that the debt has been ratified by the people, and in the earnest hopea that it i po, but guarding myself against any eh - prelssion of opinion, I may as well give a summaryr of the Act providing for the furding of the debt in the near form now. insa efrigittl h next mall leavesj edo eern ttl h Ner bods reto be issued payable in 20 years, to bear 7 per cent, per annum interest, payable halfyearly on the 1st of January and the 1st of July in California-not in New York as formerly. The first payment of interest to be on the lst of January, 1859, when it is understood to be the intention to pay a whole year's interest, although the law does not exprem this fact. The claims now outstanding against the State which are to be funded are:- " L Civil bonds, issued under the Fundlng Acts of 1851, 1852, I53, 1855, and 1856, with the interest due thereon added. (This aBplies to the CaliforDian Bonds now floating tl1 over a wo V2d) *- 2. Controer's wArrantb drawn for cvil expenses prior to the lst of January, 1857, and now outstanding, excluding eerLain of those evidences of indebtedness which were re- auired to becanoelled by an Act of the Legislature of the sOth of January, 1856; and also some others, which wree declared ilegal by the courts of law. "3. Just or legal claIms against the State accrued crior to the lst of January, 1857, and which may be allowed and audited by Act of the legislature. " All persons having any of the claims (as above) against the State of California entitled to be funded shall, upon 'the presenttion of the same to the Treasurer of State, receIve in exchange therefor a bond or bonds of the State of California. "Such claims mzay be received for funding, and bonds therefor may be ILssued prior to the Ist of January, 1859, but not afterwards; and all clanms not presented for funding prior to that time are excluded from the provisions of this Act, sec. 6 and 12." The provision to be made for the payment of the debt and interest to grow due thereon being the most important portion of the law, I quote in extenso: "Seo. 6. For the payment within 20 years of the prin. cipal and interest of the bonds i3sued under this Act there shall be levied annually, until the bonds are paid, and promptly collected In the same manner rs 3s or may be pro. vided by law for ordinary State taxes, a tax of 30c. on each $100 of the assessed value of real and penonal property in the Sthte, and the fund derived from this tax ahail be set spart and applied exclusively to the payment of the interest on the bonds herein provided and the final redemption of the prlncipal of the bonds, and the faith of the State of California is hereby pledged for the payment as herein provided of the bonds issued by virtue of this Act, and the interest thereon ; and all moneys that may be received by the State of California from the United States Gooernent on account of the civil fund. so called, are hereby irrevo. cably pledged to the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds issued under this Act. A wilful refusal or ns glect by supervisors or any other officer to levy or collect she tax imposed by this Act shall be a misdemeanour, and the person or persons convicted thereof shall be removed from offce and punsed by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by Imprisonment in the county gaol not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment." Theexcess of the above tax over and above the amount of the annual interest is to be converted into a sinking fund for the gradual redemption of the debt, and should the " Interest Fiud" prove la any year insufficient to pay the coupons the deficiency is to be made up " out of the General Fuad of the State." Many of your renders will, perhaps, expect some opinion upon the validity of the law which has just been pased by the people, supposin it to have been ratified. If so, 1 am Isorry toube under the necessity of disappointing them. All that I can undertake to do s to state the case with precision. It is already generally known that the former Funding Act was declared void by the Supreme Court of this State, on the ground that the debt of the State exceeded the limit of Indebtedness fixed by the constitution. The Judges, in their decision to the above effect, expressad an opinion,- " That the indebtedness of the Slate could be legalized by the Legislature adopting the present indebtedness, and submitting th, some, In conformity with the 8th article of the constitution, to the peo0ple for ratification." in compliance with this opinion, and in the spirit of that article of the constitution, as construed by a majority of its memnbers, the Legislature acted It passed the Funding Act, of which I have above given a summary, nd if the people have now ratified this Act at the eleotion held two days ago by " a majority of all the votes cast," they have by such " majority of votes" assumed the debt; or, in other words, they have declared it valid. *Whether these proceedings are, in strict legal interpretation, within the terms of the 8th article of the constitution and in accordance with the spirit of the whole of that instrument and with the Intentions of ita framers I cannot undertake to say. I will merely add that a general conviction prevails that the debt is now placed upon a legal bais. The question whether or not a convention ahould be called for the purpose of amending the present constitution of the State was also submitted to the people, and the opinion generally entertained is that they have negatived the proposition. Powerful influences were brought to bear to defeat tho calling of a convention by the friends of persons now in office, under the fear that some of the present offices would be abolished, and that the presenb Supreme Court would be destroyed, and a new one, with five instead of three Judges, ebtablished- a question which was mooted with some asperity; for the preseat Supreme Bench is unpopular to a degree, whioh fis a great scandal to a free country. On the 25th of Augnst Columbia, the largest mining town in the southern mining region, was burnt down. Five men were killed by an explosion of gunpowder, and the loIs was $600,000.

.OMAN CGATEOLIC CHAPLA [NS IN THB BAST. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In an article which appeared in your columns a short time since you censured severely Cardinal Wisemaa for having proposed that the siums contributed by Roman Catholics to the Indian 3Relief Fund should, in the first instance, be appropriated to the outfits of the Catholic chaplains about to proceed to the scene of bloodshed in the East. From inquiries which I have made, I am inclined to think that you have dealt hardly with the Cardinal in this matter, and that the suggestion which he made was a good one. In the Crimea it was computed that about half the British arimy was composed of Catholics, who, as soldiers, have ever done their duty as loyally and gallantly as their Protestant comrades. The Roman Catholic creed considers the presence of the minister of religion by the sidea of the dying, whether in the hospital or on the battlefield, even more essential than the Protestant creed does. This feeling, which is shared in as anxiously by the priest as by the penitent, increases immeasurably the labour and the dangers of the military chaplains of that persuaMaon. As long as the war with Russia lasted there were no men present with the allied armies who lived or worked harder, or who exposed themselves more readily and constantly to death in the faithful discharge of their duty, than did our Catholic chaplains, and this with no hope of reward or distinction on this side of the grave. Their pay scarcely sufficed to supply them with the necessaries of life, nor were they considered worthy of pensions in case of broken health or distinguished service. Many of them, we know, died at their posts unnoticed aud unhonoured-as far as public notice and honours were concerned-and are now forgotten. Were I not unwilling to make my letter too long I would detail to you how one young man in comparatively easy circumstances at home threw up his chaplaincy, devoted his small means to his own outfit and to that of a brother priest, poorer but not less zealous, bound on the sa.ne mission of mercy and danger as himself; and how, repairing to the scene of disease and blood, he sank, after doing good service and winning the esteem and admiration of all who knew him, a victim to the terrible winter of 1854-5. I would tell you of a prelate of the same church, a man who enjoys, and deservedly enjoys. the confidence and respect of religionists of all classes in this country, who out of his small, his very small means-for the means of Catholic are not as the means of Protestant prelates -devoted throughout the war considerable sums to the same object. But I think it will be more practical to point out to you the reason why the arrangement suggested by the Cardinal, and animadverted on by you, becomes almost a matter of necessity at the present moment, if the Roman Catholic soldiers of our army in India are to enjoy the consolations of religion at all. The Roman Catholic priests in England are generally poor men, without private resources of their own. Their church has no rich benefices to offer them in return for cruel sacrifices freely made or hard duties manfully discharged in her honour, It is, therefore, but fair to assume that the clergymen 'who are now volunteering to do chaplains' duty in our army are actuated by none but the purest and highest motives. In a worldly point of view they can have nothing to gain. Probably, few will survive to return to this country. But it is requisite, in order to enable them even to exist in Indis, that they should be provided with a certain outfit; luxuries they do not ask for, but a small outfit is necessary. In addition to this, the *vestments and all the furniture indispensable for the decent celebration of mass call for a further outlay. 50l. is about the minimum which would suffice for the two purposes, and those persons who recollect what the outfit of a cadet or an ensign costs will not be indisposed to admit that 1001. would not be too much. Now, as far as I can learn, neither Her Majesty's Government nor the East India Directors assist the Roman Catholic chaplains in any way as to their outfit, and when they arrive in India their pay amounts, I am assured on the very best authority, to very little nore than ludf of the pay assigned to our Protestant c7hplai?ns. If this be so, I think you will admit that the arrangement suggested by the Cardinal was perhaps the best and most reasonable arrangement that could be suggested to meet the difficulties of the present emergency. It is always disagreeable to a public writer to be convicted of having made an erroneous statement; but on the present occasion it will give me sincere pleasure to learn that I amn altogether mistaken, that the Roman Catholic chaplains attached to our army in India each receive on appointment 1001. to defray the expenses of their outfit, and on landing in the East the same pay and allowances as their Protestant fellow-labourers in the same stony vin2yards. I am, Sir. vour obedient sArvsnt J. b.

The traveller here was judicious in the choice of a strange and perilous route,-a refreshing contrast to the monotonous fair-weather voyages of ordinary yachtsmen,-happy in his companions, his weather, and hiis incidents, fortunate in reaching his bourne, and still more fortunate in returning-above all, the right man on the right track; full of fun and frolic, and with a very striking capacity for exhibiting the high talents and taste he inherited. Under these conditions, and with the accessories of choice typography and of illustrations, many of which are quite fascinating from their spirit and significance, a volume has been produced which is a luxury to the reader, and which affords him an opportunity of enjoyment almost unrestricted. The magical palace of Aladdin wanted the Roc's egg to make it perfect, and so this book, beautifal and complete as it appears, by a singular omission is destitute of an engraving of the tutelary genius so often referred to in its pages. We have some graceful verses to the "Figure Elead of the Foam," which was executed in bronze by Marochetti, and which we are assured was a "Calm soulptured image of as sweet a face, "As ever lighted up an English home, " but no vignette is found to satisfy our curiosity or to vindicate the consistency of the writer, whose gallantry should have retained an image of his fair "harbinger" to grace the record of the perils through which she preceded him. For our own parts,we object to have our curiosity raised and thus disappointed, but, having marked the inexplicable omission, we proceed with the adventurer's story. A gentleman of Iceland, and other amusing companions and attendants, duly scheduled in a Drama.tis Personce, accompanied him on his voyage. But his starting was delayed by the untimely illness of his captain, and by the difficulty similarly exDerienced by the King of Scotland in the ballad of "Sir Patrick Spens :"- " Oh, whar vwill I get a skeely sldpper. " To sail this gude ship of mine? " After some delay, howvever, a very competent substitute turned up, and, starting from Stornoway in the Hebrides in Jtne, 1856, in 10 or 12 days the writer, Lord Dufferin, *as dating a letter from Reykjavik, having landed in Iceland. The little ship had behaved beautifully on the top of the Atlantic rollers, or "Spanish waves," as they are called, and- "Few peoplo can have any notion of the coziness of a yacht's cabin under such circumstances. After having remained for several hours on deck, in the presence of the eempest,-peering through the darkness at those black liquid walls of water, mounting above you in ceaseless agitation, or tumbling over in cataracts of gleaming foam,n-the wind roaring through the rigging,-timbers creaking as if the ship would break its heart,-the spray and rain beating in your face, -everything around in tumult,-suddenly to descend into the quiet of a snug, well-lighted, little cabin, with the firelight dancing on the white rosebud chintz, the well-furnighed bookshelves, and all the innumerable knickknacks that decorate its walls,-little Edith's portrait looking so serene,-everything about you as bright and as fresh as a lady's boudoir in May-fair,-the certainty of being a good 300 miles from any troublesome shore, all combine to mspire a feeling of comfort and security difficult to describe." A great fund of amusement was furnished to the voyagers by the writer's servant, one Wilson, who regarded life genera}ly and this passage of it in particular as an opportunity for exhibiting his sanguine despondency. Wilson was never seen by the writer to smile but once, and that was when he came to report that a sea had nearly swept his colleague the steward overboard. He professed such a limited belief in his own star that success with him was itself a disappointment; and his consolations for his companions when afflicted with sea-sickness, and which are recorded in the form of a dialogue, were full of sinister presentiments. Next to the melancholy Wilson, of whose features we have a characteristic portrait, the most notable subject was a melancholy cock which had been shipped at Stornoway, and became gradually bewildered on the subject of that meteorological phenomenon called the dawn of day. "In fact," says the writer, with the observant humour which is one of his characteristics, "I doubt whether he ever slept for more than five minutes at a stretch without waking up in a state of nervous agitation lest it should be cockcrow. At last, when night ceased altogether, his constitution could no longer stand the shock. He crowed once or twice sarcastically, then went melancholy mad; finally taking a calenture he cackled lowly (probably of green fields), and leaping overboard drowned himself." It is further suggested that, simultaneously with his perplexities as a natural philosopher and chronicler of sunrise, he was wvounded in his affections by the mysterious manner in which every day a fresh member of his harem used to disappear for the sustenance of the voyagers. Thus, with the help of Wilson and the cock, the writer reached Iceland in good spirits, where he found the scenery like that on the west coast of Scotland, only bolder and more tourmente, the atmosphere clearer, and the local colours more intense. In fact, on this latter feature Lord Duifferin is at pains to express himself writh sufficient emphasis, that we may have a clear reflection of his own impression. Reykjavik consists of a collection of wooden sheds (such are its houses), which are built along the lava beach and flanked at either end by a suburb of turf huts. On every side of it extends a desolate plain of lava: the pier is constructed out of huge boulders of lava, the seasand is pounded lava, the mud on the roads is lava paste, the foundations of the houses are lava blocks, and in dry weather you are blinded with lava dirt. The most available means of communicating with its learned inhabitants, who are cordial and hospitable, was found to be Latin, which may suggest an opportunity to some of our Fellows of Colleges for cultivating hereafter that now neglected language. The looks and costume, manners and castoms, of the indigenes were noted with a pleasant interest which was generally mixed with admiration, and observations on their history and antiquities are of course combined with extracts from the chronicles with which scholars are familiar. As might be expected in so icy a region, hospitality has a potent alcoholic quality which it required all the writer's traditional prowess to encounter. How he fared towards the conclusion of an Icelandic dinner shall be told in hi own amusing reports: - "After this began the public toasts. "Although up to this timae I had kept a certain portion of my wits about me, the subsequent hours of the entertain. ment became thenceforth enveloped in a dreamy mystery. I can perfectly recall the look of the sheaf of glasses that stood before me, six in number; I could draw the pattern of each; I remember feeling a lazy wonder they should always be full, though I did nothing but empty them, and at last solved the phenomenon by concluding I had become a kind of Danaid, whose panishment, not whose sentence, had been reversed; then suddenly I felt as if I were disembodied,a distant spectator of my own performances, and of the feast at which niy person remained seated. The voices of my host, of the rector, of the Chief Justice became thin and low, as though they reached me through a whisDering tube ; and when I rose to speak, it was as to an audience in another sphere, and in a language of another state of being; yet, however unintelligible to myself, I must have been m some sort nuderstood, for at the end of each sentence cheers, faint as the roar of waters on a far-off strand, floated towards me; and if I am to believe a report of the proceed- mngs suhsequtently shown us, I must have become polygiot ia my CUps. According to that report it seems the Governorthrew off (I wonder he did not do something else) with the Queen's health in French, to which I responded in the same language. Then the rector, In English, proposed my health-underthe circumstances a cruelmockery, -but to which, ill as I was, I responded very galantly by drilnkng to the beaux yentx of the counteEs. Then somebody else drank success to Great Britain, and I see it was followed by really a very learned discourse by Lord D. in honour of the ancient Icelanders, during which he alluded to their discovery of America, and Columbus's visit. Then came a couple of speeches in Icelandic, after vhich the Bishop, in a magnificent Latin oration of some 20 minutes, a second time proposed my health; to which, utterly at my wits' end, I had the audacity to reply in the same language. As it is ft so great an effort of oratory should not perish, I send you some of its choicest specimens:- "'Y Viri illustres,' I began, ' insolitus nt sum at publicum loquendum, ego propero respondere ad complimentum quod recte reverendus prelaticus inihi fecit in proponendo meam salutem; et supplico vos credere quod multum gratificatus et flattificatus sum honore tam distincto.

Mur. ray, 1857, baudc aliter quam allos,-et virginum Islandarum pulchri. tudoper omnes regionea cognita ea.

"The last words meohanicaUy rolled out, in the same ore rotundo' with which the poor old Dean of Christchurch used to finish his Gloria, &c., rn the Cathedral. "Then followed more speeohes,-a great chinking of glasses,-a Babel cf conversation,-a kind of dance round the table, where wo successively gave each alternate hand, as in the last figure oi the Lacers,-a hearty embrace from the Governor, -and finally-silence, daylight, and fresh air as we stumbled forth into the street." From Reykjavik Lord Dufferin and company visited Thingvalla and the Geysers, for which purpose they had to invest in a drove of ponies and make elaborate preparations. Jollity was of the party, made as usual more jolly by the doleful forebodings of Wilson; and sO aided they reached the two parallel Gjas or chasms which are the lateral boundaries of the plain of Thningvafla, a sunken or subsided district full of iissures and emerald depths of water, and containing that very remarkable spot where, at a period when feudal despotism was the only Government known in Europe, free Parliaments used to sit and regulate the affairs of the Icelandic republic. The character of this spot is clearly indicated by some interesting drawings, and its geological formation is speculated upon with much ingenuity. But this iS only one of the natural curiosities which doubtless exist in t!is wonderful island, over a great part of which, consisting of the area occupied by the Skapta Jokul and its mountain-cradled fields of snow and icy ridges, human foot has scarcely ever wvandered. }From the bosom of this desert district descended the most frightful visitation ever known to have desolated the island, and it may give a good idea of the scale of nature's operations in this strange land to cite Lord Dufferin's vigorous description of the occurrence:- " This event occurred in the year 1783. The preceding winter and spring had been unusually mUd. Towards the end of May a light bineish fog began to float along the confines of the untrodden tracts of Skapta, accompanied in the beginning of June by a great trembling of the earth. On the 8th of that month immense pillars of smoke collected over the hill country towards the north, and coming down against the wind in a southerly dirention, enveloped the whole district of Sida in darkness. A whirlwind of ashes then swept over the face of the country, and on the 10th innumerable fire sprouts were seen leaping and flaring amid the icy hollows of the mountain, while the river Skapta, one of the largest in the island, having first rolled down to the plain a vast volume of fetid waters mixed with sand, suddenly disappeared. '-Two days afterwards a stream of lava, issuing from sources to which no one has ever been able to penetrate, came sliding down the bed of the dried-up river, and in a little time-though the channel was 600 feet deep and 2t0 broad,-the glowing dellige overflowed its banks, crossed the low country of MIedalland, ripping the turf up before it like a tablecloth, and poured into a great lake, whose affrighted waters flew hissing and screaming into the air at the approach of the fiery intruder. Within a few more days the basin of the lake itself was completely filed, and having separated into two streams, the unexhausted torrent again recommenced its march, in one direction overflowing some ancient lava fields, in the other re-entering the channel of the Skapta, and leaping down the lofty cataract of Stapafoss. But this was not all; whUe one lava flood had chosen the Skapta for Its bed, another, descending in a diferent direction, was working like ruin within and on either side the banks of the Hverfisfliot, rushing into the plain, by all accounts, with even greater fury and velocity. Whether the two issued from the same crater It is impossible to say, as the sources of both were far away within the heart of the unapproachable desert, and even the extent of the lava flow can only be measured from tile spot where .t entered the inbabited districts. The stream which flowed down Skapta is calculated to be about 50 miles in length by 12 or 15 at its greatest breadth; that which rolled down the Hverfisfliot, at 40 miles in length by seven In breadth. Where it was imprisoned between the high banks of Skapta the lava is 500 or 600 feet thick, but as soon as it spread out into the plain its depth never exceeded 100 feet. The eruption of sand, ashes, pumice, and lava continued tiU the end of August, when the Plutonic drama concluded with a violent earthquake. ,"hFor a whole year a canopy of cinder-laden cloud hung over the island. Sand and ashes irretrievably overwhelmed thousands of acres of fertile pasturage. The Faroe Islands, the Shetlands, and the Orkneys, were deluged with volcanic dust, which perceptibly contaminated even the pure skies of England and Hlolland. Mephitic vapours tainted the atmosphere of the entire island; even the grass which no cinder rain had stifled completely withered up ;-the fish perished in the poisoned sea. A murrain broke out among the cattle, and a disease resembling scurvy attacked the inhabitants themselves. Stephen3on has calculated that 9,000 men, 28,000 horses, 11,000 cattle and 190,000 sheep died from the effects of thisone eruption. The most moderate calculation puts the number of human deaths at upwards of 1,300, and of cattle, &c., at about 16':,000." Of course Lord Dufferin and party did not neglect the Geysers, in which vicinity they were when at Thingvalla. In fact, they spent some days at the spot, in order to witness an ebullition of the principal Geyser, which ia a very irregular performer. On one occasion, irritated by a false alarm, they detern^.ined to revenge themselves by going and tormenting the Strokr. What the Strokr is, Lord Duifferin shall tell us in an admirable bit of descriptive writing: "Strokr (or "the churn") you must know is an unfortunate Geysir, with so little command over his temper and his stomach that you can get a risc out of him whenever you like. All that is necessary is to collect a quantity cf sods, and throw them down his funnel. As he has no basin to protect him from these liberties you con approach to the very edge of the pipe, about five feet in diameter, and look down at the boiling water, which is perpetually seething at the bottom. In a few minutes the dose of turf you have just administered begins to disagree with him; he works himself up into an awful passion; tormented by the qualms of incipient sickness, he groans and hisses, and boils up, and spits at you with malicious vehemence, until at last, with a roar of mingled pain and rage, he throws up into the air a column of water 40 feet high, which carries with it all the sods that have been chucked in, and seatters them scalded and half-digested at your feet. So Irritated has the poor thing's stomach become by the discipline It has undergone that even long after all foreign matter has been thrown off it goes on retching and sputtering until at last nature is exhausted, when, sobbing and sighing to itself, it sinks back into the bottom of its den." While the party were watching at the Geysers they were startled by the appearance of Prince Napoleon, who, with his suite, had reached Reykjavik two days after themselves, and had now followed on their track. A fraternization naturally ensued, which led to a further companionship; but before we follow their further proceedinas in conjunction we are naturally arrested at a revelation which we find here of the primitive implicity of Icelandic manners. It may be the means of sending so many young tourists to Iceland that this simplicity may soon disappear; but for this result we entirely decline to be answerable. The revelation of this fact we make on the responsibility of Lord Dufferin, premising that the hero of the adventure was not Lord D. himself, but the surgeon, photographer, and botanist of the expedition- ' Having unluckily caught cold, instead of sleeing in the tent, he determnined to seek shelter under a solid rooftree, and, conducted by our guide Olaf, set off on his pony at bedtime in search of an habitation. The next morning he reappeared so unusually radiant that I_could not help inquiring what good fortune had in the meantime befallen him, upon which he gave me such an acoount of his last night's reception at the farm that I was almost tempted to bundle tent and beds down the throat of our Irritable friend Strokr, and throw myself for the future upon the hospitality of the inbabitants. It is true I had read in Van Troll of I something of the kind, but until now I never fully believed it. The Doctor, however, shall tell his own history. it'No sooner,' said he, ' had I presented myself at the door and made known my errand than I was immediately welcomed by the whole family, and triumphantly inducted into the guest quarters. Everything the house could pro- duce was set before me, and the whole society stood by to see that I enjoyed myself. As I had but just dined an additional repast was no longer essential to my happiness; but all explanation was useless, and I did my best to give them satisfction. Immediately on rising from the table the young lady of the house (old Van Troil says It is either the mother or the daughter of the house, if she be grown up, who performs this office) proposed by signs to conduct mte to. my apartment. Taking in one hand a large plate of skier, and In the other a bottle of brandy, sbe led the way through a passage built of turf and stones to the place where I was to sleep. Having watched her deposit, not withoat misgivings-for I knew it was expected both should be diaposed of before morning-the skier by my bedside and the brandy bottle under the plllow,-I was preparing to make her a polite bow, and to wish her a very good night, wben sbe advanced towards me, and, with a winning grace difficult to resist, insisted upon helping me off with my coat, and then, proceeding to extremities, with my shoes and stookings. At this most critical.part of the proceedings I naturally imagined her share of the performance would conclude, and that I should at last be restored to that privacy which at such seasons is generally considered appro- priate. Not a bit of It. Before Iknew where I was I found myself sitting on a chair, in my shirt, trouserless, while my fair tirewoman was engaged in neatly folding up the ravished garments on a neighbouring chair. She then, in the most simple manner in the world, helped me into bei, tunced me up, and having said a quantity of pretty things in lelandie, gave me a hearty kiss and departed. 'If,' he added, ' yslu see anything remarkable in my appearance, it is probably because- This very morn yve felt the sweet surprise "'Of unexpected lips on sealed eyes;' by which he poetically intimated the pleasing ceremony wh, ch had bwaked him to the daties of the day. I think it i eedless to subjoin that the doctor's cold did not get bet,ter as long as we remained in the neighbourhood, and that bad it not been for the daUy increasing fre of his looks I sioufd have begun to be alarmed at so protracted an indisposition." At this stage, in answer to an invitation from the French Prince,' Lard Dufferin abandoned that part of lim propoled route,whkoh Wmr to AT himavrv AU iiknown tract to the north-weat of the island, sn1 was taken in tow by the Reine Hortense to expedite him northwards. A ball was given by the French oficers to the fair Icelanders before starting, and the adventurers were further cheered by the following characteristic augury from Wilson: - "We're going to the icy regions, Sir, ain't we? Well, I've just seen that ere brig as is come from there, Sir, and they say there's a precious lot of ice this year. (Pa.se.) Do you know, Sir, the skipper showed me the bows of his vessel, Sir. She's got seven feet of solid timber in her for'ard; we? ve only two inches, Sir I" (Dives belowv.) In fact, Wilson is the exact counterpart of John Want, in The Frozen Deep, and with this Job's comforter of the crew they left Iceland to the southwards to encounter the perils of the Arctic Seas. The Foam, in the first instance, was towed by the :Reine Hortense across the Faxe Fiord and round the base of Snaefell, then along that north-west extrenity of Iceland by the rugged cliffs of which few mariners have ever sailed. Indeed, until within these last few years the passage is said to have been impraticable in consequence of the continuous fields of ice which used to drift down the channel between it and Greenland. Iately some great change seems to have taken place in the lie of the Greenland ice, and during the summer time you can pass through, though later in the year a solid belt binds the two shores together. Here is the famous Eyrbiggja district, the most classic ground in Iceland, of which Lord Dufferin recals to us some of the curious traditions while he speculates on their origin with no deficiency of penetration. His observation of " the last sunset" as they proceeded northwards is also recorded in a poetic strain which was natural to the occasion - "It wasnow just upon the stroke of midnight. Ever sinee leaving England, as each four-and-twenty hous we climbed up nearer to the pole the belt of dusk dividing day from day had been growing narrower and narrower, until having nearly reached the Arctic circle, this, the last night we were to traverse, had dwindled to a thread of shadow. Only another half-dozen leagues more, and we should stand on the threshold of a four months' dsr ! For the fsw preceding hours clouds had completely covered the heavens, except where a clear interval of sky that lay along the northern horizon promia lO g stage for the sun's last obsequies. But, like the heroes of old, he had veUed his face to die, and it was not until he dropped down to the sea that the whole hermisphere overfdoved with glory and the gilded pageant concerted for his funeral gathered in slow procession round his grave, reminding one of those tardy honours paid to some great prince of song, who, left during life to Panguish ina garret, is buried by nobles in Westminster Abbey. A few minutes more the last fiery segment had disappeared beneath the purple horizon, and all was over. 'The king is dead-the king is dead-the king is dead! Long live the king!' And up from the sea that had just entombed his sire rose the young monarch of a newv dy; wrhile the courtier clouds, in their ruby robes, tnrned faces still aglow with the favours of their dead lord to borrow brighter blazonry from the smile of a new mnaster. "A fairer or a stranger spectacle than the last Arctio sunset cannot well be conceived. Evening and morning, like kinsmen whose hearts some baseless feud has kept asunder, clasping hands across the shadow of the vanished night. "'You must forgive me if sometimes I become a ISttle inagniloquent, for really, amid the grandeur of that fresh prim eval world it was almost impossible to prevent one's imagination from absorbing a dash of the local colouring. We seemed to hlave suddenly waked up among the colosal scenery of Keats's Hyperlon. The pulses of young Titans beat within our veins. Time itself, no longer frittered down into paltry divisions, had assumed a more majestic aspect. We had the appetite of giants-was it unnatural we should also adopt ' the large utterance of the esrly gods? " The Reine Hortense had established a system of communication with the Foam by means of a huge black board displayed from the hurricane deck of the former vessel, and when the French officers wished to inaugurate their arrival in the Arctic waters by a carnival Lord Dufferin was asked in this fashion whether he could make any suggestion on the subject. To this the Briton replied, after deep reflection, by the monosyllable "' Grog," when there foUowed an entertainment and masquerade on board the Reine Hortense, at which his Lordship was invited to assist. During this interlude of jollity, however, the thermometer began to fall, and soon they were steering among innumerable ice islets. On the evening of the fourth day it came on to blow hard, and, the Frenchman's coal running too short to attain Jan Mayen, Lord Dufferiln as informed by the board tÂ±at he was about to return to Reykjavik. There was just time to write a letter or two to friends in England, when the towrope was let go, and, with mutual cheers, by wav of adieu, the Reine Hortense and the Foam parted, the latter still proceeding on its way. Jan Mayen was reached after considerable difficulty, and a landing effected on its desolate shores. In no part of the Darrative does the pluck and dash of the noble mariner come out into such bold relief as in this successful attempt to reach Jan Mayen's Island, in spite of ice floes and fogs. The picture of the black peak, laced with snow, as the fog cleared off and disclosed the mountain towering above the Foam, is one of the best bits of word-painting in the book. Thence the voyagers stood for Hammerfest, where they made some acquaintances among the Lapps, while the consistent Wilson had the satisfaction of there obtaining most trustworthy information that Spitzbergen had now become totally inaccessible. Lord Dufferin, however, had views of his own about ocean currents and drifting fee, and he determined to proceed; and, after touching at Bear Island, and tacking about to clear the ice in much difficulty and perplexity, Spitzbergen was sighted, but ice on all sides seemed to close it in from access. "About this period Wilson culminated. Ever since leaving Bear Island he had been keeping a carnival of grief In the pantry, until the cook became almost half.witted by reason of his Jeremiads. Yet I must not give you the impression that the poor fellow was the least wanting in I pluck'; far from it. Surely it requires the highest order of courage to anticipate every species of disaster every moment of the day, and yet to meet the impending fate like a man, as he did. Was it his fault that fate was not eqnally ready to meet him 9 HIis sbare of the buisiness was always done; he was ever prepared for the worst; but the most critical circumstances never disturbed the gravity of his carriage, and the fact of our being destined to go to the bottom before tea-time would not have caused him to lay out the dinner-table a wbit less symmetrically, Still, I own, the style of his service was slightly depressing. He laid out my clean shirt of a morning as if it had been a shroud, and cleaned my boots as though for a man on his lastlegs. The fact is, he was imaginative and atrabiliots, contemplating life through a medium of the colour of his own complex on. "This was the cheerful kind of report be used invariably to bring me of a morning. Coming to the side of my cot with the air of a man announcing the stroke of doomsday, he used to say, or rather toll ; - "'Seven o'clock, my Lord.' "'Very well; how's the wind ? "'Dead ahead, my Lord-dead !' "'How many points is she off her course ?' Four points, my Lord,-full four points ! (Four points being as much as she could be.) ' I Is it pretty clear ? eh ! Wilson?P " ' Can't see your hand, my Lord !-can't see your hand 1' 'Much ice in sight ? "'Ice all round, my Lord-ice a-all ro-ound !'-and so exit, sighing deeply over my trousers." Tho navigators were much impeded by fogs, but, in spite of fogrs and ice, they succeeded after a voyage of II days in anchoring, on the 6th of August, in the silent haven of English Bay, Spitzbergen. A panoramic view which accompanies the work gives, no doubt, a faithful view of shores which are vast, desolate, and fearful to contemplate. Primeval rocks and eternal ice constitute the landscape and encircle the bay in which for a time the Foam found an anchorage. The adventurers landed and discovered there the skeleton of an old Dutch navigator of the last century, the frost gnawing for ever on his bleaching relics, yet eternally preserving them. Some bones were gathered, some photographs taken by the light of the midnight sun, a few ptarmigan and a bear were shot, a memorandum of the visit was deposited in a tin box, and on the 11th of August the travellers set sail to return. Five days after quitting it Spitzbergen remained in sight, and again and again the sepulchral voice of Wilson announced to his master that there was "' ice aU round." When he overheard that their next destination was theMaelstrom,he concluded that his supreme hour had arrived,and perhaps to his disappointment he was taken aafely to Throndhjem, whence the Foam made its way homeward, touching at Bergen. That this book will be as successful we cannot doubt from the marked literary ability with which it is written. We might, perhaps, object to a little flippancy and sentimentality here and there, but where there is so much entertainment so gracefully afforded it would be ungracious to dwell on occasional blemishes. As a whole, we must admit that a more charming narrative of a summer's tour we have never read, while there is so much to delight ua independently of the interest of the subject that we are pleased to infer we shall hear of the author hereafter.

MIDDLESEX sE&oarg Oct. L9. The criminal business of the October Quarter Seadons commenced this morning at Clerkenwell before Mr. BLIss, Q. C., and a bench of magistrates. There were 58 prisoners for tril, 47 charged with felony and 11 with misdemeanour. Mr. Buss deliverad a short charge to the grand jury. The Rev. Robert Maguire, the recently elected incumbent of Clerkenwell, attonded and went through the ceremony of taking the Oath of Allegiance. William Thomas, 18, was indicted for feloniously break. lDg and enterlng the dwelling-house of James EHickman, and stealing therein a coat and other property value 81. l0 He pleaded " Guilty." Sentenced to one year's hard labour. James Crayford, 49, was indicted under the first section of an Act of Lord Campbell for unlawfuUy having in his possession by night a certain instrnment called a crowbar, v'ith intent to break and enter the dwelling-house of James Wagstaff. He pleaded" Guilty." Mr. BLISS sentenced him to three months' hard labour. Michael Henry, 31., was indicted for unlavrfully and maliciously stabbing Edward Macdonald. It appeared that the prosecutor and some acquaintancem bad been drinking at a publichouse at Wapping, whence they proceeded towards the Thames Tunnel. They met the prisoner in company with a young woman, who spoke to the prosecutor. This ultimately led to a quarrel, and the prisoner, after thTeatening to mark him for life, drew out a knife and stabbed hinm with it in the thigh, and severely bit him in the feshy part of the left arm. The wound in the thigh was in close proximity to the femoral artery. The lury iound the prisoner Guity on the second count, The CounT sentencod him to six months' hard labour. (Before Mr. CRmASY.) Elizabeth Hunt, a marine store-dexler in Victorla-grove, Cambridge-heath-road, who was convicted on Wednesday last of having feloniously received a number of pewter pots which had been stolen by three boys from publichouses, was brought up for jndgment. Mr. CREASY said it was a most aggravated case, and sentenced the prisoner to four years' penal servitude. The boys, who had pleaded " Guilty" of stealing the pots, were sentenoed each to seven days' imprisonment' and to be whipped.

POLICE. MANsSioN-HoruS. - John M`Crow, a ferocious-looking fellow, was brought before the LORD MAtYoR, obarged with having stabbed William Witham, a fishdealer in WhitecroFs-street, under the following circumstances :- The prosecutor, having been sworn, said,-On Saturday afternoon last I was in a coffeeshop, iri Botolph-lane, eating a haddock. I asked the prisoner to phss me the pepper-box, and he made a dirty observation In i eply. A young man wbo was standing by commenced larking with the prisoner, wbo immediately took a tableknife froin his pocket, and said, "1 This is how I serve people who interfere with me." He placed the knife on the table, ar.d took up a stick, say nghe would strike any low-lived fellowwho did anything to him. I said to him, " Why, you are the first that ought to be bit with it for the expression you used just nowv." The prisoner took up the stick for the purpose of striking the young man whom I was anxious to protect from vlolence, and upon my endeavouring to assist him the prisoner again took up the knife and stabbed me In the hand in two places. I then proceeded to St. Thomas's Hospital, where I got my wounds dressed. Cross-examined by the prisoner.-I did not at All interfere with you. You made use of a very bad expression when I asked Tou to pass me the pepper-box. Heiry Wooster, a costermonger, said,-I was present in the coffeesbop when the prosecutor was stabbed. He was eating a haddock and asked for the pepper-box. The prisoer replied, " You don't waut it," and made use of a filthy expression. He then began larking, and got out of temper, and tried to give me a crack on the head with a stick. He bawled out, " The first man who uses bad langusge ought to be hit on the head wth the stick." I replied, "Then, you are the first man who ought to be hit on the head." I got larking with him, and he got on the seat for the purpose ef striking me. The prosecutor tried to stoD him, upon which he took up the knife which he had previously taken from his pocket, and stabbed him in the hand. He "jobbed" the knife at him twice, and I immediately saw the prosecutor's hand covered with blood. Cross-examined.-I did not throw any tea or coffee at you. The prosecutor was trying to protect me when you stabbed him. 'Mr. G. Grabham, house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, said,-The prosecutor came to the hospital on Saturday, when I examined his hand, which I found had been wounded in two places. They were incised wounds, and had been very cleanly cut evidently by a sharp %instrument. One vwas in the palm of the hand, the other in the middle finger. The one in the palm of the hand I consider a dangerous wound. The danger of bleeding has not passed by yet. Cross-examined.-One of the wounds Is very deep, and boih have been inflicted by " jobs" with a knife. MIonger, police constable No. 564.-I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. I asked him for the knife, and E e said he had thrown it away. I received the knife produced from a waiter, who found it under a seat. I afterwards found a white-handled knife in the prisoner's pocket, upon which he said, "That's not the one I stabbed him with; it was a black-handled one, and I would serve any one the same who interferes with me." The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said that the prosecutor bad been wounded accidentally in attempting to take the knife from him. He was fully committed for trial to the Central Criminal Court. MARLSOROUcG}-STREET.-Anna MlUer was brought before Mr. BIGHAMI on suspicion of having caused the death of her infant child. Mrs. Frances Whittaker, 5, Gerrard-street, said she was district visitor of St. Anne's, and the prisoner, whom she had previously known in her capacity of visitor, came to her shop on Saturday evening and said her child was in a fit. She looked at the child and saw it was dead. She told the prisoner the child was dead, and the prisoner began to cry, and said it was her busband's fault. Witness had called on the prisoner some davs previously, and then found the infant crying piteously. The prisoner said she had lost her milk for three days. Mr. Jones, Soho-square, surgeon, had examined the child, but did not find any external marks of violence, The child appeared very much emaciated, but that might proceed from natural causes as well as neglect. Inspector Lester, C division, said there would be an inquest on the infant that evening. Mr. BINoHA,%f said it appeared to him that the witness had accounted for the death of the child by her statement of what the prisoner told her respecting the stoppage of the natural feod of the child. He should discharge the prisoner. As soon as the prisoner left the dock her husband got into the witness-box and complained of his wife's general had conduct and violence. He had been obliged to appear against her at this court. Mr. BINGHAr said, on proof of violence, he was quite prepared to restrain her in the way the law pointed out. MAtItYLIoN-x.A very respectable looking man, about 40 years of age, described as " Mr. John Probert, a farmer, at Llanfeliy, Abergavenny," was placed at the bar before Mr. BROuGROwN, charged with being concerned with another In stealing property to the amount of 100. from the shop of hIr. Stradth, a jeweller, c, in London-street, Pad. dlr Grange appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Herring for the prisoner. The caee, from the Deculiar circumstanoes counectod there. with, excited no smgI1 degree of interes The first witness alied wa Sophia Aygott, in the service of Mr. Stradth. She said, -On the 3d of this month, between 8 and 9 in the moraing, while in the kitchen, I heard a penny drop Into the area. I went and picked it up, and saw a man looking down, and on my asking him what he was looking for, he said, "It's down there." I went up stairs, opened the door, and gave the penny to a man whom I believe to be the prisoner. He seemed much gitatod. He went away, and I watched as far as the oDrner of Sussex-gardens. Last Saturday evening I was walking with a young friend, and saw him cross over towards an oysterstall. I said to my frend, "I believe that's the man," and sho ran home to my mJstress, and I went with her and we came back with a polioeman. On returning I looked in at the window of a coffeeshop and went in with the constable, and there saw the prisoner. I and the policeman had some coffee, and while there T had a full view of him (prisoner). Mr. BRovoUGTO.-.Are yon still of opinion that he is the man to whom you handed the penny? Witnes-I am, Sir. Witness added that she thought she was doing no more than her duty in giving the prisoner in charge, her master and mistress having been spoken to by her previously. Mr. Herring cross-axamined the witness upon vaious points in her evidence, and elioited from her that she "thought" at one time he was the man. Thomas A^ugustus Oram, apprentice to Mr. Stradth, said that at half-past 8 on the morning of the 3d inst. the prisoner-he bei eved he was the person, and, in fact, he had ecarcely any doubt about it-cailed him outside the shop, and, pointing to a gold chain in the window, asked him the price of it. He told him he wolid go and inquire, and at the same moment Mrs. Stradth, who was in the kitchen, called out to him " Tom !" Witness immedtately afterwirds returned to the shop, and there saw another man, who inquired of him if Mr. Taylor was there, He was told that he was not, and after he had lost sight of both the parties it was ascertained that 14 gold chains and a gold and silver watch had been stolen. Xr. BRoUGHToN. -Did the prisoner go into the shop at all. Witness.-He did not, your Worship. By Mr. Herring.-I was in the shop at 20 minutes to 8- the other apprentice, whose duty it was to "set out' the window, was not there. Two chains had been left hanging up in the vwindow on the overnight. I brought the box containing watches, &c., from the parlour into the shop. AfterIhad been asked by the prisoner outside tbe shop the prioe of the chain I went in, and there found another man. I did not see him go in, s my attention was directed towards the chain the price of which I was asked. I have told somebody that I thought I might be mistaken as to tho prisoner being the man who spoke to me outside by the window. I have said so to the servant girl. Mr. BRoUGHTON.-Looking at him now, do 7on believe he Is the man? Witness.-I am sure of it. By Mr. Herring.-After master came home I and the servant both talked to him and mistress about the robbery. I think the prisoner iB tbe man. Mr. BRouGonroO.-Let Sophia Aygott stand up again. (To witness) Do you still adhere to it that the prisoner is th_e reon ? witness.-Yes, Sir; I believe he is. By Mr. Herring.-The man who dropped the penny, and to whom I gave it, seemed greatly confused. Some other witnesses were called and they were very ably examined at much length and cross-examined by Mr. THe rearned gentleman, after a protracted inquiry, in the course of which he pointed out rnany discrepancies in some of the statements made, set forth that the prisoner was a fanner of considerable wealth ad unblemished reputation, He should further be in a condition to prove by clergymen and other highly-respectable parties who had been telegraphed for that prisoner had not been away from his home until the period of his getting into this trouble since March lati; it would clearly be shown to be a case of mistaken Identity. Mr. Herring mentioned a case in which some time ago a jeweller was robbed of a large amount of property; a person was charged with having stolen the Eame, and after. wards a great portion of the stolen valuables was found to have been purloined by a relative of the prosecutor. Mr. BROuGHTON considered that the identity had been so sworn to as to justify him in remandiug the accused; but he should order that he be brought up again to-morrow (this 31r. Herring asked for the prisoner to be liberated on baSI, but the magistrate, as the remand wxs for so short a ime, did not comply with the request. He (Mr. Herrig) was quite sure that there would be fll and clear proof adduced as to his respectable client's perfect innocence. LAwsesb-Charlotte Richardson, a middle.aged woman whose husband is t present undergoing a sentence of transportation, was place:at the felons' bar before Mr. ELiorr oD a charge of being concerned with John Brookes and Harriet Perch at p resent in Newgate awaiting their trial for the offence of breaking into the dweDinghouse of Mr. John Coleman, at the King's Arms, in Meeting-house-lane, Pecklamn.rye, and stealing therefrom 230. in banknotes and gold. On the night of the 1st of September last the bedroom of Mir. Colemau was entered from the hack premises, the drawers broken open, and a bag, containing banimotes and gold to the above amaount, carried away. Some days after Brookes and Perch were apprehended, and the evidence against them of being concerned in the robbery being quite conclusive thev were fuUy committed for trial, and the officers engaged in the case have been since endeavouring to Aprehend the third party connected with the offence. Sergeant Bond, of the P division of police, said, that from information he received he on Saturday evening went to a shop kept by the prisoner near Lant-street, Borough, and on seeing the prisoner told her that he must take her into custody on a charge of being concerned, with a man named Brookes and a woman named Perch in robbing a publichouse on Peckham-rye of 2301. in gold and notes. She replied that she knew nothing about the robbery, though she had heard something of it and knew a man named Brookes. He thea asked her if she had any money in the house, or books relating to money or property, and she replied she had not. Oa searching her house, however, various articles of new wearing apparel and a savings6bank book for 301., deposited in the savmgs-bauk in Bloomsbnrystreet, Bishopsgate, were found in her drawers ; and at the stationhouse seven duplicates, relating to other uroperty, were found on her person. The goods, she said, sbe had got from a taUyshop, and referred him to bills which sbe had with them, but on examining these he found that their dates were as far back as 1855, and the money, which had been deposited in the savlngs-bank on the 7th of September, just seven days after the robbery, she said was the pro. duoe of the furniture she had sold. Thomas Evans, a constable belonging to the D division of police, corroborated the testimony of the last witness rospecting the finding of the articles produced at the house of the prisoner. Mr. Coleman, the prosecutor, identified the prisoner as having been frequently at his house and drinking at his bar with the man Brookes and the woman Perch, who stood committed for trial, about the time of the robbery, and Mr. Goslin, a next-door neighbour, swore positively to have seen her come out of a passage by the side of the house of Mr. Coleman on the mght, and about the time of the robbery. Mr. Smart, a butober in the Bagnigge-wells-road, said, that some weeks ago the prisoner deposited in his hands the savings bank book produced, and 101. in gold, and said she -as about to take a coffeesbop in the Bethnal-greenrdad. She subsequently took the book and money from him. .Mrs. Susan Brookes, the wife of Brookes, who stands committed for trial, was called as a witness, but her testimony was objected to by a solicitor who appeared on behalf of the prisoner. Mr. ELUOrTr, however, desired her testimony to be taken, and she was sworn. She deposed that some months ano her husband left her and went to live with the woman Perch. She also said that the prisoner lived in the same room with her for 12 months up to about six weeks ago, and had no furniture whatever there to dispose of. Sergeant Bond requested a remand and a summons agains` a witness who, he thought, would be able to give important evidence in the case of a future examination. 11r. ELLIOT complied with the request, and the prisoner was remanded for a weeka

CAPTURED ARTILLEBY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -I think that few of your readers can have failed to be surprised at the quantity of artillery said to be captured from the Indian mutineers by our troops in every skirmish which has taken place. A letter which appeared in your columns on the 14th inst. throws a curious light on this point. The writer, a private in the Carabineers, describes how his troop attacked a party of rebels 20 or 30 miles from the ffeerat cantonmeuts, " routed themn and took a number of guns." He goes on to say:- " And how, and of what, do you think tbey were made 7 Why, I will tell you. You may, perhaps, have seen the iron socket of a telegraph oost, by which it is fixed into the ground; of course it is hollow, and a touchhole is easily made at the smallest end of it. So far, so good; there is your gu. No%v for the car. iage, &c. ; they cut up the wooden posts, and for the ammunition they cat up the telegraphic wires into small rough pieces, tied up in an old sock or somethig of that kind, just like grapeshot. Not such a bad get-up for a set of niggers !" The capture of guns is generally considered to be the test of complete military success. A couple of guns lost in the Crimea were more mourned over than the loss of 500 men. The Ru-dians used to make any saorifice rather than abandon their field artillery. I think, therefore, that we ought to be careful not to give in this Indian warfare brevet rank to the iron sockets of telegraph posts, which would appear, from your corre. spondent's description of them, to be so much moredangerous to our enemies than to ours;lves that it is almost a pity to deprive them of such weapons. I am, Sir. your obedient Ase,,+t MATTER OF FACT.
TO THE BDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -You were good enough a few days ago to publish a letter of mine pointing out the feasibility of establishing a mesns of communication on railway trains between the passengers, the guards, and the eDgine drivers. Might I suggest that petitions to Parliament should be prepared and signed, demanding that the construotion of wome such contrivance be made obligatory on railway com. panies s Between this and the next session I have no doubt that the accumulation of signatures would be overwhelminx in number in a matter so nearly concerning tha Uves and limbs of a whole nation. I am. Sir. vour ohes-ini. - hIANGLED REMAINS. -lerts, Oct. 17.
COTTON.-GLASGO W Oct. 17,.-We have had a week of almost total cessation of business in our cotton. market, caused chiefly by the untoward course of the money-market aud the general glooum caused by the heavy faUlures in town. We make no change iu our quotations. Goods and Yarns.--The inarket for goods nd yarns is very quiet, and few or no transactions going on. We have to report the failure of the highly respectable firm of Auld and Buchanan. printers, with liabilities to the amount of 80,0001. The assets show 1vs. in the pound, which the creditors expect vUIl be realized. Large consignments to America, and the failure of a firm there with which they are involved to a large aimount, have brought about the calamity. Pig Iron.-The closing week has been remarkable for fluc. tuations in value of pig iron. On Monday the announce. nment that discount had been advanced to 7 per cent. caused considerable anxietv, and in efforts to realize the price of warrants fell from 65s. to 62s.6d. cash. Next day the panic was even more 5utense, sales being reported at 58s., but in course of the same afternoon there was more inquiry, the market closing firm at 60s. Since then prices crept gradually up under influence of brighter proapects in the money and stock markets, touching 62s. 6d. prompt cash esterday. To-daythere was again a smart panic, and for cash =X10 dayssales were made at from G0s. 6d. to 6s. 9d.,olosing without animation nominally at 61s. No. 1, 64s.; No.3, '9s. The re port that one of our local banks was very heavily involved with several large failures, and the resignation of the moaniager, have contributed much to unsettle our rmarket. fAdvortisement..] -To Parents and Teachers.-Some difflcalty has bren experiencedn finding books writteu in a style euffi. elently plain ant shimple to suit the capaelt'es of very young chidreu, a series of tales written hya Pros bant lady weU knowzfor hermuctea ful exertions in promoting the building of churchea in destitute Disats r.f Ireland; vwil be fotnd peouarlrs adapt-d for Instructing children ot fr,om two to five years.

13BGISTRATIOr. 'TTRRTI V Mr. T. F. Macqaeen, the revising barrister, held am adjourned court at Lincoln's-inn yesterday morning, for the purpose of disposing of the list of electors for the parish of r, Holborn, on which a point had been raised of soLne importance (reported in The Times of Thursday last), the consideration of which had been deferred in order to prevent inconvenience to the representatives of the other parishes. Mr. HAM 0on2,D as representative of the overseers of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, said the collectors of qaeen's taxes had objected (being electors upon the register) to a large number of persons who had duly paid all the parish rates but had not paid a quarter's assessed taxes due at Christmas but not demanded until March. The REVIsING BARRIUSTER said the point was a delicate one; but there was a preliminary to its consideration-viz., the proper notice should be given to the parties objected to. Had that been done?t One of the objectors stated that notice of the objections had been served upon the overseers, bat not upon the persons objecttd to. The learned BARRISTER referred to the 17th section of the 6th of Victoria, chap. 16 (the Registration Act), which prescribed the mode of making objections, and which reqWured that notice should be given to the persons objected to, -either personalservice or by post. addressed to the place of residence asset forth upon the register. As that had not been done in these cases the nature of the objection could not be inquired into. Mr. W. S. Mays, one of the persons objected to, complained of the conduct of the collectors, who had objected to 176 ratepayers. One of the collectors said they had stated the fact of the non-payment of taxes in due time to the overseer, who, nevertheless, had inserted the names in the register, and the collectors then considered It their duty to object. The REVISING BARRIsTER said the proper notice had not been given, and therefore the objections could not be entertained. The names were accordingly retained upon the list. The learned BAiRRISTrR said, before quitting the court, he wished to make a few observations in reference to some circumatances that had occurred in another borough. The Legislatare appeared to assume that the voters would at the proper period inspect the lists posted in public places as appointed by the statuate. That, however, was a degree of vigilance the want of which could scarcely be held to be censarable, for there was nothing to compel anv pexon either to procure himself to be registered or to vote when he was registered. The privilege of voting for the election of members of Parliament excited a lively interest in the minds of some men, while others regarded it with less concern, and some even with indifference. Even lawyers, the guardisns of the constitution, were sometimes remiss, of which an instance had been given in a neighbouring borough; but it wonld be absurd to impute blame to those gentlemen upon tnat account. There were, however, persons occupying official positions upon whom the Reform Act had imposed the duty of drawing up the lists, a duty which ought to be carefully and religiously performed; and when, as it sometimes happened, it was discharged in a slovenly manner, it caused great inconvenience and merited severe rebuke. It was extremely hard that, in consequence of a want of care on the part of the parish authorities, gentlemen who were fully qualified to be upon the register should be necessarily removed from it by reason of imperfeotions and inaccuracies in the lists. Mr. H&srmmoxD remarked, as some excuse for occasional Inaccuracies, that the time allowed for the preparation of the lists was extremely short. The XEVISLNG BARPISTER admitted that, but still considered that in some parishes there had been a great want of care. The Finsbury revision was then concluded, and with It terminated the annual labours of the revising barrister in the metropolis.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-From the late correspondence in your colurmns respecting the want of communication between the engine drivers and guards of railway trains it appears that the public have not cognizance of a simple and perfect apparatws which was invented ahout two years since for this purpose. It consists of a light metal rod fixed underneath the carriages, with a simple coupling at the end of each carriage, so as to make a continuous communication through the train. One end of this rod is under the control of the guard, and the otber is attached to a steam whistle on the locomo tiea boiler. The guard can thus sound the steam whistle in ease of need, and I caitnot but think that this svatem is the most simple aud effective that has been proposed. The small extra expense which this apparatus would involve has hitherto prevented its general use, the railway comparies preferring t) coetinue the imperfect system of cord communication, which is frequently neglected in the hurry of starting, or of attaching extra carriages to the trains. I know that the gentleman who has invented this new apparatus has used all the influence lie possesses to have it properly tried and tested, hut without success. It is, I be. rleve, now proposed to take decided steps to bring his invention before the public; and, in the hopes that this letter may aid in iudcing railway companies to give the general subject their consideration, - - I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

TO THE EDITOR OF THEH TIMES. Sir,-Trusting to your powerful pen in always attempting to secure the publie safety to those who travel by rail, I beg the favour of your making known to the many who trav3l the state of things at a station on the Great Western Railway, which by your so doing may be the means of preventing an accident which alI who live in this neighbourhood are in daily fear of. At the Klrtington Road Station (a small one, no doubt) between Banbury and Oxford one man, and one man only, has every day to do the following duty:-He has to issue tickets for the up and down trains, frequently coming and going close together; he has six signals to attend to and four p_ir of points to attend to ; al passengers' luggage, to receive all parcels, to collect tickiets, to carry a lamp in the evening half a mile on each side the station, his office and signals in the meantime being left without any one; he has also to weigh up coal for the company and to load the corn trnoks. This latter duty is being every day less, as the corn is going more each day by the canal, for want of assistarce in loading, ite has also to put any horses and carriages on the rails. Now, Sir, how can any one man on earth do all this with safety to the travelers? As for myself, I am constantly on the line, as are a numerous quantity of people in this neigh. bourhood, who all stand in dread of an accident. I remain, Sir, your obedient servant. A. A. UGw. Â£0.
FATAL ACciDE?NT TO MAJOR BARFOOT.-An accident of a serious character, which terminated in his death a few hours afterwards, occurred at Soathampton on Saturday afternoor. to Major Barfoot, of Midlington-house, near Droxford, Hants. The Major was proceeding ia his carriae down the Northam-road, when the horses took fright and ran away, and the galant officer jumped out. He unfor. tunately fell upon the back of his head, whereby concussion of the brain was produced. He was immediately removed to the Royal Hotel, and medical assistance was called in, but the Major never rallied after his fall, and he expired about 9 o'clock in the evening, after lingering for some bours in a state of insensibility. An inquest was held yesterday afternoon, at the Royal Hotel, before the borough coroner, and a verdict of " Accidental Death" wa, returned. Major Barfoot's only child, a daughter, is married to Earl Howth, of Howth*castle, Ireland. BREADSTCFFS TN AMIERICA.-Froui our market reports it appears that within two months the prices of ffour have fallen in this city from $1 25c. to $3 15c. per barrel upon different brands, the general decline being about $1 25c. Yet, in the face of this decline, which is still goin2 on, and in the face of the immense crops of wheat which are awaiting shipment from the great West, and in the face o this financial pressure, which is operating to reduce everything to its proper level, we are told by some of oar wise contemporaries that breadstuffs will be high in Now York this coming winter. And wherefore? Because of the want of the cash required to pay for the transportation of these breadstuffa from the West to the East. A few facts, however, are better than a tbousand empty theories; and as it is a fact that the grain producers and dealers of the West must paytheir debts, and must havethe money for their pro. duce, even at a sacrifice, we rmay safely conclude that the ways and means will be found for bringing the produce to market. Where wheat by the quantity may bn had In Kentackv and IlUinois for 40 or 50 cents a bushel, if our speculators and banks cannot raise the cash needed to bring it to the seaboard European capitalists will be very apt to have a finger in the pie, and we shall soon find their agents among us ruling the roast in the flour-market. It is bad enough to be threatened this coming winter with a general want of employment among the working clesses, without the additional pressure of increased prices for the necessaries of life wben the country is literally overflowing with its soperabundaace of wheat, corn, &c. Noo; when money is tight and high other things must come down, and when the great West has millions of debts to pay, and millions of money to raise, it miust appropriate its redundant supplies of wheat and corn, and et them to market, and seU at any price that will coll. mans the casoi. Hence we conclude that breadstuffs in this port and througbout the country wiU be lower through the coming winter cban during any preceding winter for the last 10 years.-New York ierald. FJS:CAPE FROM GAoL.--On Friday night last a lad named Grieves, about 18 years of age, made a daring escape from Stamford gaoL Sl'ortly after dusk he was placed in his cell for the night, and upon the governor of the gaol taking his rounds previous to retiring to rest he discevered the cell door open, and thq prisoner gone. Upon examination it was ascertained that Grieves commenced his escape by mounting some palisades; thences by an almost superham5n effort, ho reached the governor's sttting-room window, which was barred,and scaled the walluntilhecame to abed-roam win. dow, whenhe managed to gain the roof. We crossed the roof to the opposite side of the gaol, and after descending a spout alighted in the street. The wals of the prison are full go feet high, and some surprise is expresmed at his escape. Information of the cireumstance was immediately given to the police, and the boy was captured the following morning by the governor about three miles from Stamford, while waiting to see an elder brother to obtain a change of cloth. ing. About five weeks since Grieves made his escape from the same gaol by climbing up a spoat, and with the aid of a nail in the wall succeeded in reaching the tops of some houses, which he traversed, and finallv alighted by means of a spout into a gentleman's garden. lÂ±en days elapsedrcafore he was captured on that occasion. Grieves is andea op1gU.S months' imprisonment for a larceny.
INDUSTRIAL EHIBITIoN,.-A young lady paesenger in one of the Mount Pleasant cars a day or two ago came very near getting the hats of aU the gentlemen, who noticed a singular and unexpected display of good sense and prudence on her part. On entering the car her dress caught, and was considerably torn, the rent presenting a very unhandsr,me appearance in contrast with the exceeding neatness of her apparel. As soon as she was seated she removed her kids, and diving into the recesses of a tiny pocket brought oat a needle and a bit of thread, after uniting which with most dexterous manipulation she set to work to repair damages, and very soon spread out the folds of her robe as complete and whole as if no acoident had ever occurred. The materials of industry were then re-deposited in their resting-place, and the lady assumed her kids and an attitude of repose, smiling triumphantly.-Bo8on (United States) Courier.
