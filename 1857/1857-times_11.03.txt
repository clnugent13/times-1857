MONBRY-MARKBTad CI'YINTBLLIG.ENCE. Monday Eveing. This being the day for the half-yearly balance at the Bank of England, the transfer offices were cltsed, and it was kept as a bolyday at the Stock-Exchange. There were consequently no regular transactions in thepublic funds, but on 'Change Consols, which left off on Saturday at 90i, were nominaUv quoted 891 to 90 for money, and there were buyers at 90 at the close. The heaviness was attributable to the news from America showing that the recovery described by the previous mail had been only partially maintained. In the discount-market to-day the demand was rather less pressing, and in some cases choice bills were negotiated at a fraction below the Bank minimum. The payments faling due on the 4th are not unusually large, and in London there is every appearance that they will be weU met. The corn-market was quiet this morning at the rates of Monday l3st. The final price of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bozrae this evening was 67f. for money and the present account, showing a decline of au eighth. The approach of the settlement has caused a full demand for loans, and applications have been numerous at the Bank of France. The drain of gold to the continent continues, and about 40,0001. was withdrawn frora the Bank today. The precise amount of specie to be shipped for the East by the PeniDsular and Oriental steamer Ripon on the 4th is 956,8461. Of this sum 1501. is for Alexandria, 5001. for the Mauritius, 859,3161. for India aud Ceylon, and 96,8801. for China and the Straits. Nearly the whole of it is silver, the gold amounting to I2,1521. only. Some acceptances were returned this afternoon of Messrs. R. Wilson, Hallett, and Co., of Liverpool, the correspondents of Messrs. Robb, HaUett, and Co., of New York. The engagements of the firm are believed to be large, but it is hoped such difficulties as have arisen may be but temporary. The private letters from New York to-day do not describe any material variation, but they reach only to the 20th of October, while the accounts by telegraph vid Halifax are to the 22d, and report a considerable decline in all sorts of securities. This adverse movement appears to have been caused by the arrival of the Europa, which left Liverpool oa the 10th of October with the news of the first advance in the Bank of England rate of discount, which occurred on the 8th, and was from 5i to 6 per cent. The further advance to 7 per cent. would be announced by the next packets-the Baltic and the Persia; but, as these took out 313,0001. in gold, it wiU probably be found they have assisted to restore confidence. The disappointment with regard to the rapidity of the anticipated rebound seems to have arisen from the conduct of the banks, who, in resorting to suspension, have withheld one of the chief benefits looked for from it-namely, a partial restoration of the note circulation, which, in their efforts to save themselves, they had contracted to an amount far below the requirements of the country for its internal trade. Hence the only advantage at present felt was from the arrangement entered into by all the banks throughout the State to receive each other's notes at par, subject to the regulations of the Clearinghouse. This, however, was an immense gain, sineo it would enable produce to be sent and remittances to be made from point to point. The fear which has restrained the banks from granting increased acosnimodation seems to have been from the ab Bence of any positive power on the part of the Governor or Legislature of the State to legalize their continued suspension. The people of New York, when they agreed to the amended constitution of 1846, wanted confidence apparently in their own financial sobriety, and tied themselves down by a clause which now, at a time of emergency, deprives them of independent action. This clause was that the Legislature should not sanction, either directly or indirectly, umder any circumstances, a suspension of specie payments. A more dangerous proviso could not have been framed. Any country that permits a paper currency to exst, and deprives itself of the power of making it a legal tender whenever extraordinary circumstances may seem to call for such a measure, must always be in a condition of DLex&ring,thetaentl N wer ~y the Government that averted a financial convulsion ; and in cases of panic it must over constitute the Eole safeguard of the community. Unless banks are supposed to lock up aU their customers' cash and never make the slightest use of it, they cannot be exempt from the consequences of a popular mania, and a bank that continues paying after it has become clear that an indiscriminate ran is established actually gives a preference to the very persons whose insanity is creating the evil. If the State of New York wishes to establish a sound paper circulation we may hope to see it adopt Sir Robert Peers Act as a model, reserving to itself, as has been the case in England, the right of a free community to deal, through its representatives, with any exigency that may afterwards happen. The next steamer from New York wil be the Atlantic, with dates to the 24th. She may be expected on Thursday. At Hamburg the rate of discount remains at 8c per cent. The cause of the recent advance was the purchase of 60,0001. in silver on London account. The accounts frorn Mexico by La Plata state the disorder which reigns throughout the country to be indescribable. Marauding bands, each numberlng two or three hundred men, infest all the interior districts, while the official classes, degraded and mercenary as ever, squander at the gamning table the gains of corruption. The command of a regiment or an appointment in a Custom-house constitute the readiest means of fortune; and the contraband system, being thus a chief dependence of civil and military empzoye's is carried to an extent that has entirely extinguished the possibility of fair trade, and has thrown the profits of all commercial operations into the hands of the most depraved cla^sses. Cotton, linen, and woollen manufactures brought by land over the American frontier are to be obtained at 30 per cent. under the cost price of those imported in a regular manner by honest merchants. The administration of justice is marked by the same feature4, and, finallv, the all-pervading shamelessness Ss exhibited in the highest degree by the general Government in its treatment alike of its home and foreign creditors, the revenues being profusely exhausted in pandering to tho army and satisfying the avarice of favourites. One of the most approved modes is said to be by nominating partisans to extraordinary diplomatic minssions paying them one or two years' salary in advance, and then allowing them to remain at home. With regard to the claims of the English bondholders the utmost indifference is shown, and, owing to the belief that their own Government will do nothing for them, their position seems to be simply a subject for polite jests. If, under these circumstances, it should turn out that the assistance by the British Cabinet to enable the Mexican Government to escape the national extinction that would have inevitably resulted from a collision with Spain is to be granted without any conditions being exacted the creditors will have a lasting ground of complaint. Nothing can be worse than their present prospect. Any change would therefore hold out a chance of benefit, and the British uovernment can hardly deprive them of that chance without recognilzing that special measures should be taken for their protection. The following relates to the recent ex:tension of Customhouse facilities with regard to the passenger traffic from the continent:- " Slr,-The Lords of the Treasury have, on the recommendation of the Commissioners of Customs, extended the privileges of examining pasengers' baagage at the Londonbridge terminus of the South-J1astern Iadlway. Under the authority now granted baggage, whether registered or not, may be examined on the arrival of any train, whether tidal or otherwise, from Dover and Folkestone. excepting ouly the train starting from Dover at 2 a.m. But the passengers may have their baggage forwarded by the next train, arriving in London at 7 45 a.m. "It will therefore be seen that traveUers arriving at Dover and Folkestone from Boulogne, Calais, and Ostend wiD, so far as the Treasury and the Customs in London ara concerned, have the greatest facilities afforded them. In coming to the determination to grant those extended privileges the Lords of the Treasury state, ' There can be no longer any doubt that the arrangement has hitherto been attended with very great advantage to the public.' Of this every one will be satisfied when it is known that from the 6th of April last up to the 30th of September 7195 pas sengers availed themselves of the advantages der.ved from having their baggage examined at London-bridge. ' It is fair to the Commissioners of Customs to state that they have willingly recommended this measure, and that they are most anxious that it should be carried out in saCh manner as will be most satisfactory to the public. The raeponsibility is now shifted to the railway authorities, who it appears were the parties really blameable for the disarrangezngnt of the traffc during the past month, It r§msias to be seen what arrangements tIey will make for carrying Into effect the accommodation which the Customs have afforded them. On this point they have no longer excuse. Nor will it avail them to say that they cannot persuade the continental companies to work with them. If the Great Northern of France Company will not put on a tidal train from Paris to Boulogne, that is no reason why the South-Eastern Company shonld not carry the passengers forward immediately after their arrival at Folkestone. The delays and annoyance at Boulogne can never justify similar treatment at Folkestone. "A word or two on the petty annoyance practised at Folkestone, for the purpose of detaining travellers there, may not be amiss. Every effort is exerted to induce poople to remain and have their bhgage examined there. The most absurd representations, always false, are made for this purpose, and every paltry excuse is resorted to. A short time ago some friends of mine were returning from the South of France, and one of them having a small box of bonbons in a reticale, which, of course, was not registered, it was detained, and the owner told that it must paes throngh the baggage warehouse. When this trifle wsS examined it was found that the duty only amounted to Is. Had the owner waited for the examination it would hava caused a delay of one night; and rather than submit to this the parcel was left behind. "Another matter has been pointed out, and which is most objectionable. Iam informed tha the tide officers at Folkestone are in the habit of handling ladies' drasses as they para from the boattothe shore; that is, apartal search is made as to whether there is anything concealed on their person or not. Now, if there Is anything more strictly forcidden than another by the regulations of the Customs, It is this; and I feel assured that any well-grounded complaint made to the Board of Customs would be followed by the Immediate dismissal of the offender. So well known is this among all grades in the service that, had I not been informed of the fact by some ladies on whose trath I can place the most implicit reliance, I could not hAve believed IL It Is might the public should know that sach a practice Is not only not sanctioned by the Board of Castoms, but that any complaint on this head will meet with immediate redress. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, " OBSERVER." A meeting was held this afternoon of creditors of M§r. A. Hill, shipping agent and commission merchant, whose suspenaion followed upon the announcement of the failure of Mesrs. Rosw Mitchell, and Co., with which firm he had had some rather large accommodation transactions. A statement of affairs, prepared by Mr. Chatteris, the accountant, was submitted, from which it appeared that the total liabilites expected to be proved against the estate are 61,2681., of which 50,4771. is on account of accommodation bils. The assets are estimated at 17,4301. A proposal was made on the part of the insolvent that a composition be accepted of Ss. 8d. in the pound, payable in three instalments, extending over a year, to be succeeded by a further dividend of 2s. 4d. to the trade creditors only, secured by an assignment of claims of the estate upon the drawers of the irregular paper. After a short dicussion a resolution was passed accepting the terms, subjectto confirir^tion by aU the creditors within one month. The general business of the port of London during the past week was to an average extent. The number of ships reported inward was 263, being 50 less than in the previous week. Those included 56 with cargoes of grain, rice, &a., 12 with sugar, 11 with fruit, and 3 with coffee. The number cleared outward was 131, including 17 in balast, showing an increase of 6. Advices from Kurrachee contain very favourable accounts of the capacity of that port to receive vessels of large tonnage. It is believed that at high tide there is always a depth of 26 feet. Returns have also been published showing the increase of trade at this important place, which, in addition to receiving all the traffic of Scinde, is likely to become a chief route to the whole of the North-Western provinces of India. Ten years back its exports were 154,7301., and last year they were 734,5221. Wool has become a most prominent article of production, the value of the quantity shipped inthe 12 months ending the 30th of June last being 311,5901. The receipts of the Zollverein for the first six months of 1857 amounted to $12,910,109, against $12,137,508in1856,ahowing an increase of $772,601. The Grand Duchy of Hesse shows the greatest improvement. In the receipts from Hanover, Nassau, and Electoral Hesse there was a falling off. The following on the Manchester markets during the past month is from Messrs. P. Barbour and Brother:- "A month ago the market, from a healthy and buoyant appearance, exhibited a slight reaction, and prices had receded a little, The dsstrous accowunts from America, the raising of the Bank rate to 8 per cent, and the want of confidence at home have since that time had a considerab e infuence on it. Agreatlycrtiled busine has been doing thtafal fui tully 5 per cent. has taken place from the highest point. The prospect of better accounts from America and the favourable intelligence received by the mail just arrived from Shangh and Bombay have exercised a favourable inflaenoe on the market, which is much less depressed thau it was early in the week, and some considerable purchases have since been made of staples adapted for the latter ports. The home trade this autumn has been good, but the beneficial effects of cheaper provisions are likely to be counteracted by diminlshed employment. Orders are being countermanded for the Ulnited States, stocks are accumulating, and prices, with a few exceptions, graduilty declining. ' Short time' is extending and some minll are entirely closed, which is not remarkable, as it would be the worst poicy to make goods without any prospect of immediate sale out of the present high-priced raw material. " The sales of cotton in Liverpool have recentlybeen very small, especialty during the last week, the daily average being only 2,380 bales. The total sales of the month show a remarkable contrast to the activity which prevailed during the two previous months, the weeklr average being 29,400 bales, against 64,900 in August, and 63,600 in September. Prices have been irregular, and in many cases nominal, but a considerable fall has been established-say, from Jd to ld. per lb. ; the greater portion of which has been lost during the current week. Yesterday there was a little more activity, and a more hopeful feeling prevailedL"
GLASGOW, Oct 31.-Cotton.-We have had a very quiet week In cotton, owing to the continued inactfvity in Liverpool and the gloomy state of the moneymarket. Spinners have only bought where they have been absolutely compelled to do so, aud the transactions have been so limited as to give no opportunity to test prices. To effect sales, however, considerably lower prices would require to be taken. There is a somewhat better feeling in the market to-day. Goods and Yarns.-After some weeks of unexampled depression we are now able to report a decided feeling for the better having set in. The commercial accounts from all parts of India are favourable, and from America the next mall, it is confidently expected, wDi confirm the report of the crisis being past its height. We cannot report much business doine, and the few transactions that have been entered into are chiefly for the India marketa. The home trade prospects are good, and no doubt we shall have more doing for this branch immediately. Iron.-The pig iron-market has been depressed during this week, in sympathy with the commercial difficulties existing in this city and Liverpool; prices have not, however, been seriously affected, the lowest cash prices accepted being 58s. 6d. for mixed numbers' warrants. The Western Bank bavln arranged to go on as usual, a better feeling has prevaile during the last two days, and yesterday 59X. cash prompt was realized. To-day there was no busmess done, and quo. tations are strictly nominal; warrants, 69s. ; No. 1, 61s.; No. 3, 57s ; Gartsherrie, No. 1 72s. Makers are now coming pretty freely into the market as sellers. Exports for North of Europe and Mediterranean ports go on actively, and the total make a good average.
THE COBH TRADB. MA&RK-LA2iA MONDAY Ayr0nmooq. lNv- 2 The arrivals of wbeat last week were good, of oats very large, and of other things moderate. The exports were 1,C03 quarters of wheat, 24 quarters of barley, ad 14L quarters of oats. The quantity of Bglsh wheat was 6,061 quarters; of foreign 18,345 quarters. The morning's supply from Kent and Essex wM short, and the trade ruled dull at last Monday's rates, the condi. tin of the samples being affected by the weather. For foreign tbe inquiry was limited, at unaltered pnices. The supply of flour was 16,554 sacks of Englsh, 3,112 barrels 834 saks of foreign. Norfolks partly recovered from Friday's depresdon, and were held at last Monday's rates. In town and foreign samples there was no change. The receipts of English barley were 1,901 quarters; of foreign, 7,405 quarters In the absence of cboloe miating samples the secondary sorts were Is. to 2s. per quarter lower; but this reduction did not extend to gilinding sorts. 4alt was a very heavy trade, and 2g per quarter cheaper. The total quantity of oab was 60,949 quarters; of these 46,406 quarters were foreign, 13,088 quarters Irish, 871 quarters Scotch, and only 584 quarters English. The heaviness of tho supply occedoned a general reduction of 1s. per quarter on old sarmples, and ls. to 1s. 6d. per quarter on rbew foreign to black Irish. Of beans there were only 37 quarters of foreign, and 570 quarters of English. Of peas 680 quarters of Englsh, and 765 quarters of foreign. Business was slow, but the value of both these pule remadned the same. The supply of linseed was 8,335 quartrs, with 1,685 quarters exported. The prices of seed gave way 2s. per quarter, but cakes remained a free sale at former prices. In the seed trade there was universal dulnesg, the demand being on the most restrictive scale,and entirely consumptive. Canary scarcely maintains its value. Cloverseed, trefoil, mustard, hempseed, rapeseed, and other descriptions were held at former quotations.

THE TPA TRADE, Nov. 2.-The deliveries in London estimated for the week were 682,1171b., being a decreose of 81,4691b. compared with the previous statement. CONSECRATION OF THEE CIArEL 01F HARRow SCHsOOL.-Smnday last, All Saints'-day, having been fixed for the consecration of the now chapel of Harrow School by the Lord Bishop of London, a very largo concourse of old laurrovians and others took place to witness the ceremony. The bishop arrived at the head master's house shoctly before U o'dock, when the procession moved tovards the chapeL The school was already in possession of the body of the chapel; wihUe tie chancel, gaUery, and every vacant corner of the whole area were occupied by visitors. The usual legal formalities having been gone through, the bisbop, followeed by the clerical masters, walked from the east to the west end o the bullding, ropeating In alternate verses the 24th Psalm. On returning to the commnunion-table tho consecration address and prayers were read by the bisbop, after which the morning service was read by the head master, the Litany by the second master, and the appointed lessons by the two senior clerical assistant masters. The sermon was preached by tho bishop, from the Epistle for AU Saints' Day, Rev. vii., 0, " A great multitude which no man could number." The Sacrament was afterwards administered to a very large number of the boys of the school, including 50 or 60 former Harrovians from the two Universities and numerous visitors. The service did not terminate till half-past 2 o'clock. The ovening service was attended by the bishop and a congregation as numerous as that in the morning. The sermon was preached by the head master. The collections throughout the day, for a stained glass window in the chancel to cominemsorato the con asetion, amounted to upwards of 1041. The building which. has now entirely replaced a small brick chapel ereoted on the same alte about IS years ago, is one of the most beautiful works of its distinguished architect, Mr. Scott. It is of flint, richly faced with stone, and comprises an apsidal chancel of great elevation, with a crypt below it, as weU as a very beautifal south aisle, erected in comuuemoration of the Harrow officers (22 in number) who fell in the Crimes.. The windows in this part of the chapel are designed to be filled with stained glass as monuments to some of the Individual officers in whose collective honour the aisle has been beuit. Five beautiful painted windows have been already placed in the apse, one of which is the gift of an old Harrovian now at Oxford, and tbreo others have been presented by the boys in three of the Masters' Rouses. The exterior of the chapel is not yet quite completed, bat the interior preserted a beautiful spectacle, filled as it was on Sunday by vu overflowiDg congregation.

ROYAL SURREY GABDBE& The report of the committee of shareholders appointed on the 6th ult, states that they have examined the counterpart of the lease which wag granted to Mr. T.ler, and sold by him to the company for 14,0004, and find that there was at the time of such sale ; term of only 12 years from Michaelmas, 1855, unexpired; that the premises were subject to a yearly rent of 3464, and a s tennial ofin of one year and &-half of the annual va~ue of the premises; that there is no covenant for renewal in the said lease, and there is a covenant on the part of the lessee to delver up at the end of the loase all buildings which can by law be claimed by the freeholder. The committee are ot opinion tha' under these cireumstances the lease of the gardens, at the time of the parchase thereof by the company, ias not worth above 1,000t Tho contract for thDe muichal and adjacent buildings was 17,0004, &nd the amount actually expended on the buildings was nearly double that amount It appears by the books that the directors accepted bills on behalf of the company amounting In the whole to 20 6471 of which at the tine of filing the titioni tho Court of Bankruptcy 9,T78l were un id_ Jullien was appointed director and manager of tho' mntsical department on the 30th of November, 1855, for a term of five years, at a salary of 2, a-year. It a bS the first balance-sheet of the directors that from the by theofirt alno h bth of Auegust to the 29th of September (being half the regular season) there was paid as follows --M. Julliesns salary 1,25011; band, 2,4471; vocalists, L040! - refreshments to chorns;, 150L-total, 4,8871; being at the rate cE 9,774i. for the whole season of 20 weeks. The commnittee had had great difficulty in ascertaining any of the facts relating to mortgages, the minute-book being strangely deficient in information on the subject, although throe mortgages, amounting together to 14,5001., were approved, but whether these mortgages vwere ever executed does not *ppear by tho minute-. The deed of settlement provides that the directors shall have power to borrow 10,0001 at their discretion, without obtainin the sanction of the shareholders, but that they shall not exceed that sum without tbe cousent ef the shareholders at a*emal meeting The mortgage to Messrs Scott and Cornwall for 6,00g, and the first mortgage to Mr. Colborn, would, therefore, exhaust the borrowing powers of the directors Tbh general balance sheet up to the st of October, 1856, shows that the company had then expended all their paid up capitl, and were acthslly in debt to the amount of 14,363l; moreover, it aupear by the bankor's book that on the 1st of October the balance in tho banker's hands was onld 199f, wnhile the dividends delarsed would amount to t,304L, which was notto be p aid til tho 1t of January foIowing In tho meantime the directors borrowed on mortgage tho dsum of 5t0001. from Mr. Colborn, and even that assistance wras so tsr forestalled by debte that on the 1st of January there remained only 4774s at tho bankr's and t 58 in hand, so that it is perfectly clearthatthe dividend, instead of being paid out of earnigs, w as paid out of money borrowed after hef first account was made Dp, and at a time when the company was in a shta of insolvency. wn the rnonth of April the directors caled a meeting of the shbreholder, and exhibited a balance-sheet, purporting to be made up to December 31,1856. By comparing this account writh the account made up by 3Ir. Spooner 1,o559 is entirely left out from the expeuditure, and not a wvord is said as to the " debts of the company," although there vwere then debts for which bills to the amount of 11,1434 had been cgiven, and other liabilities to the extent of 3,1801. Mr. Tyler wa; allowed to take about 300 shares boyond those which were awarded to him as the purchase money for the gardens Mr. Tyler and Mr. Weston, the auditor, have been allowed to escape without any payment on their shares. Mr. Tyler recived his salary of 6004 per annum, and also 951. as a dividend, when he stood in the books indebted to the company in 3, 5004 on his shares It appoars that the general y of the shareholders were entirely Ignorant that there were any mortgages on the property, or that the company wvas involved in debt, - until they were Informec of it by tho afridavit of their own secretary, filed in support of tho petition to the Court of Bankreptoy. The committee have come to tho conclusion that the premises might be made a place of healthful and rational recreation as well as a sourco of considerable profit to the shareholders, but it can only be done under a systen. diametrically opposite to that which has heretofore been adopted. They are of opinion that the plan of continually giving very scientifio music is a great mistake, The comnuittee recommend, as a general rule, a more varied class of music and of a more national character, such as the best English, Scotch, and Irish compositions The committee recommend that proper steps should be taket to have a fun investigation of the moortgages and all claims on the company, in order to ascertain what the encumbrances reaUy are, and whether such arrangements could be made as would enable the company to carry on the gardens with a prospect of paying the credihrs, and giving some retuLrn to the shareholders
Tnx ELECTRIO TELEGRPSHP IS AvsviSit--The estimated cost of the lines will be read with interest, as affording a fair index of the cost of material and rate of labour in the colonies. In Victoria the cost of the 3)D miles of telegraph is estimated at 751. per mile, the whole cost being 22,6001. In South Australia the estimate is 601. per mile for the 320 miles required; the total cost, 19,200?. The average cost of all the lines of telegraphs In the United States is statcd to be $200, or about 401,, and in this country it is rather more than GOh per mile, so that the estimate for the Australian lines cannot be considered as excessive. We would urge upon the local Governmenlts the duty of avoiding anything like false economy in the construction of the lines. In the 'United States durability has been sacrificed to the desire for cheapness of oonstructlon, and, as a consequence gaps are constantly oocurrins in the communications in kmerica owing to the decajing and rotting of the poles, the rupture of wires not safficiently strong, and other causes which a slight additional expenditure atthe commencementof the works might have obviated. The proposed telegraphic stations on the Victoria line are Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Raglan. WarrnambDol, Belfast, and Portland; on the line in South Australia - Adelaide, Mount Bsxker, Strathalbyn, Gool)a, Port Elliit. Guichen Bay, and MIount Gainbier. The coat of the ma:n. ttnnnce and working of the lines, includin2 interest on capital, will be 11,200?, per annum.-Austracln and NczD Zcahsnd Qazctc.
THE ACCESSION OF THE EMPEROR MYIGOLAS.* A volume issued at the command of an E Iiperor to clear the memory of his Imperial predecessor, and to satisfy that craving " for historic truth" which In recognized even by Emperors as a legitimate desure, is, of course a more authoritative pro-duction than any of the books by wbich more humble individuals modestly endeavour to inu- i ence opinlon. There is this further importance in I the resent publication, that it is the revelation of a naily secret' hitherto reserved "for the members of the Tmperial house and a few confidential friend3 ;" for though the narrative now conmunicated has been twice printed before, on -each occasion the impression was limited to 251 copies for the use of the circle thus eminently distinguished. The public were only admitted to aparticipate in the information it contains on the -death of the Emperor Nicholas himself, and in 'consequence of the present Emperor's regard for his 'father's reputation. As we are acquainted with the dstails of the last day of the life of the Czar Nicholas, "H is Majesty the prement Emperor has -deigned to think fit, for the eternal memory of his illustrious parent, also to make public the sarrtive of the first day of his Impenal career." 1rne accounts which have hitherto reached us are judged to be inaccurate, and in the meantime contemporarles are growing old and dying, traditions are disappearing, the very eye-witnesses find their memory of the past growing dimmer and dimmer, ad the design of this publication is " to re-establish the facts in their purity, and at the same time -to fill up for the future historian of Russia a blank 'which posterity would not pardon us for leaving." How far this blank is in consequence fiUed up, :and the insuBrection and bloodshed which accompajnied the accession of Nicholas are accounted for, by the present narrative our readers will be able to judge. Of the Emperor Alexander we are first informed that down to the last days of his life he entertained a secret determination to abdicate the throne and -embrace the life of a private individual. Circumstances prevented the completion of his desire. Years glided on. The Prince who in early youth liad dreamed of a private life on the banks of the Rhine, had twice crossed that river with the laurel -of victory and the olive-branch of peace, and " had avenged the destruction of Moscow by the ?reserva4ion of Paris. Russia was blazing with the glory -of her monarch; kneeling Europe was proclaiming im hersaviour, her earthly providence. But amidrt 1the splendour of all this greatness, the loftiest that was eve,- attained by man, Alexander, however his vocation had been fulfilled, found no happiness upon hlis throne." He was discomforted by the want of a conjugal and parental felicity, which he had never tased in consequence of a connexion which he had -formed in early youth, and in default of heirs both to himself and to his brother Constantine, neither -of them having any children who could with propriety be legally recognized, he was solicitous for the due transmission of his sceptre to hands which could subsequently bequeath it to legitimate heirs. Eis next brother, Constantine, having " contracted family ties of the same peculiar character," was animated besides with an innate and irresistible aversion to the idea of reigning, and accordingly Alexander dining in private with his third brother Rlcholas in 1819, after premising that he beheld with delight the conjugal and parental happinees of him and his wife, informed him that he was destined at a future period to be invested with the Imperial dignity. The young couple were struck by this communication "Cas with a thunderbolt," and, "bursting into tears, were unable to articulate a reply ;" but Alexander, " with that angelic kindness and delicacy which 'distinguished him," soothed and encouraged them, combated their misgivings, and reconciled them to their " certain and inevitable destiny." Nicholas himself, nevertheless, says thst, after the conversation terminated, they felt " precisely what a man might feel who, while tranquilly advancing along a level road, amid a lovely landscape, should see sud-denly yawning at his feet a frightful precipice, 'towards which he should be irresistibly drawn by the fascination of an overpowering force, so that he could neither go forward nor turn back." Up to -that moment he had had no such anticipations; his antecedents had afforded him no preparation for a throne, and now he suddenly found hims-'If called upon to bear " an almost insupportable burden of tremendous responsibility to God and to his own conscience-the burden of ruling the most gigantic empire in the world." It appears that the issue of Constantine's morganatic marriage, which be had contracted after his divorce from his Grand DuebessAnna Feodorovna in 1820, were excluded from the succession by a contemporaneous Manifest, in which it was laid down as a principle that a member of the Imperial family should not be held capable of communicating to such persons the rights which belonged to himself. But -even pilortothistime,according to theEmperorAlexander, "the Cesarevitcb," as Constantine was designated, " had declined to accept the Imperial crown.` It is remarkable, bowever, that he made no explicit -communication on this subject to Nicholas himself, whom it chiefly concerned. In 1821 he informned Michael, the fourth brother, when they met at Warsaw, tbat he could make himself at home with him without ceremony; " but when I expect my brother Nicholas I always feel as if I were preparing to meet the Emperor himself." Moreover, driving out with lMichael, he intrusted to him as a great secret his own determination to renounce the crowm irrevocably and for ever in favour of Nicholas. But, in contradiction of his proffered ceremonious deference, he treated Nicholas himself with signs of honour which " sometimes almost took the fcrm of extravagance and caricature," and he excused himself in answer to Nicholas's remonatrances by saying jestingly, "Thisais all because you are Czar of Mirlikii,"-a sort of nickname which he fron2 that time forward began to employ frequently in speaking of Nicholas Paulovitch. The motives which dictated this singular behaviour, this reticence was we may call it, are neither stated nor suggested, but they are left for us to guess at by the Imperial writer or deponent. One evening in the month of January, 1822, Constantine being at St. Petersburg, recalled to Michael their conversation at WVarsaw, and inforned him that "this evening the whole thing has been arranged" with the reigning Emperor, and that the Emperor had promised to draw up a particular Act i,pon the -whole affair, and to place it with the other State papers preserved on the altar of the Cathedral -of the Asumption at Moscow ; but this Act is to be kept a profinmd secret, and made public only when the necessary moment arrives. A letter is then written to the Emperor at this dlate, and in furtherance of this arrangement, by Constantine, who petitions for the transfer to his brother of his right of succession, " not feeling himself endowed either with the talents, the powers, or the energy indispensable for one who may one day be -elevated to that dignity to which his birth may give him a right ;" and the Emperor after the Interval of a fortnight answers his petition by "leavin- him fuUy at liberty to execute his- irre-I vocable aeternination,"and by "imploringAImighty God to bless the consequences of such generous and disinterested intentions." Nicholas Paulovitch and mi wife, however, remained in complete ignorance of what had taken place. The Empresa, indeed, "obe . an to throw out frequent hints," but " all the other members of the Inperial family preserved a profound silence on the subject," and, according to our poor notions of the freedom of famnily intercourse, must have been verv ullsatisfactory company for each other in consequence. It was impossible, however, for mere letters exchanged between the members of the family to annul a fundamental law of the empire, and therefore an actwas eventually drawn up,as"the Emperor had verballypromrie the Cesarevitch, but to which he <the Cesarevitch) had mode no allusion in his letter." Even then the matterwas involved in im-penetrable secrecy. The sole deporsitaries of the mystery were three personas selected by Alexanderhimself, the Count Araktcheeff, Prince Galitzun, and Philaret, Archbishop of Mloscow, the latter of whom was commanded to compose the rough draught of a Manifest transferring the succession to the Grand Duke Nicholas Paulovitch. Philaret also undertook to place the same in the ark or receptacle under the altar without revealing to anybody that he had done ,o, or rather, as the context shows, without comnmu- nicatinog to the church officers more than the faot that an instrument solemnly sealed, as they were permitted to see, was deposited there 1b the Emperor's orders. Copies of thls 27t Aceno~ f idwjjI.,copiled by upwoh comn. ~a~i of ho Epero 4exIda,Ii..by bs Imperial M~jotys Scrtar ofStae,Barn M Kofiand tranalstod Manifest or Act, after a considerable interval of time, were sent to the Council of the Empire, to the Synod, and to the Senate, but op the packet transmitted to the Council the Emperor wrote with his own hand the, following superacription:-" To be kept in the Council of the Empire until demanded back by myself ; and, in case of my decease, to be opened, before any steps are taken, in an extraordinary meeting of the Council." The delays in these arrangements, the secrecy of the proceedings, the apparent provision for a change of mlnd on the part of the Emperor, or some one of the parhies more immediately concerned, constitute such an amount of mystery that the compiler halts at th point to observe that the true key to these problems has perished with the individuals who were the actors in these proceedings. If consequently we cannot fathom them, we must add, on behalf of the future historian of Rus3ia, whose case was particularly contemplated in this publication, that the blank which is not filled up for his convenience by the Imperial memorialist is by no means inconsiderable. We learn, however, that on the 30th of August, 1825, the Em eror being at St. Petersburg with the GrandDukeMicholas, was "gloomy," and that in the folowing November Constantine, being atWarsaw with the Grand Duke Michael, had become extremely "gloomy" also. In this frame of mind, after dinner on the 25th, Constantine explains the cause of his gloom to his brother. The news having arrived that "the great spirit of Alexander was soaring into the precincts of another world," he then vouchsafes to tell him, the brother of the deceased, that he had been previously troubled by bulletins of the Emperor's illnes. " From the first days of the Ernperor's illness, which, according to the reports brought by the last feld-jitgers, had taken a most alarming turn, he had known of it, and had borne buried in his heart the tortures of foreboding and suspense." The compiler by his silence may perhaps mean to imply that in this respect the conduct of Constantine was considerate. If so, we take the liberty of making our humble objections, that in our eyes it was neither frankly fraternal, nor intelligible; and that again there is a little blank to be filed up for the future historian. Moreover, the deceased Emperor did not reveal the secret of his testamentary dispositlon of the succession, even on his deathbed. Out of the three confidential dignitaries who were present athis demise, not one was aware that the right of the elder brother to the successi( a of the throne was transferred to the second, The Empress herself was in the same complete ignorance; at all events, "4she knew of nothing precise." Thus, we cannot abstain from interpolating, is business conducted where the interests of milions depend on the caprice of an individual, and their destiny wavers as he is gloomy or propitiated. We think we can discern more meaning in these transactions than thisvolume conveys to us, but as our impression is conjectural we do not insist on it. We have, however, this strange misunderstanding to account for, that about the deathbed of the deceased Emperor his wife and his great functionaries are " await ing the commands of the newv lawful sovereign the Emperor Constantine Paulovitch," while the latter is assuring his brother JMTichaeO at Warsa-w that no change whatever has taken place in his plans or his determination, and that ' his intention of renouncing the throne is more Immutable than ever." Thus Constantine rebukes those about his person who ask for the commauds of Ris Majesty, and informs them that he had renounced the right of succession in favour of his brother. He further orders them to prepare letters to the EmpressMother in conformity with this renunciation, and at the same time communications for Prince Volkanskii and Baron Diebitch; and he sends oft his brother Michael to carry these to St. Petersburg, together with, as we infer, letters to Nicholas, one of which is private and confidential, in which he lnformn him that his former determination is irrevocable. In the meantime, while the Emperor is dying, Nicholas at St. Petersburg resolves that he must in the event of the Emperor's decease, " withmst losing a moment, take the oath of allegiance to his brother Constantine." The fatal necessity for his election in this behalf comes upon hinm as here described:- " In the course of tbe night the Empress-Mother fre. quently called her son to her side, to seek from him such consolation as he was able to give. Towards morning, at 7 o'clock, a feld -jiier arrived with the announcement that there bad taken place a cbange for the better, and bringing a letter from the Empress Elizabeth Alexlovna. ' 11 y a un niteux sensible,' she wrote, ' mais il est tres fatble.' After mouing mass, and the celebration of a particular service for Eis Majesty's recovery, the Imperial family, with the persons immediately atta¢hed to it, heard divine service in the great chapel of the palace ; the other dignitaries of the State assembled at the monastery of St. Alexander NvskU. In the palace the Empress stood close to the altar, in the saonsty, from which led a glazed door to an antechamber. There the Grand Duke also took up his stand, and ordered Grimm. the Empress's old ralet-de-chambre, in the event of anew fedjd!,ger arriving from Taganrdg, to give him a signal by tapping at this door. The mass was just concluded, and the prayer for the Emperor hardly begun, when the signal was given. The Grand Dake quietly passed outfrom the sacristy, and in the library of what had formerly been the apartments of the King of Prussia he found Count MiiorMdovitch, by the expression of whose face he instantly guessed the terrible news. 'C'est fint, Monseigneur,' Eaid the Count, Icourage maintenant, donnez l'exemple;' and taking him by the arm he began to lead him out of the room. On arriving at the passage which existed behind what was formerly the hall of the Chevalier Guards the Grand Duke felt himself on the point of fainting; he sank into a chair and sent for Isuhl, body physician to the Empress, without whese presence he was afraid to communicate the news, dreading the possibility of its causing her a stroke of apoplexy. Ruhl speedily arrived, and then they all three proceeded. The prayers for the recovery of the Emperor were Etill going on, but the E1mpress had not failed to perceive the prolonged absence of her son; she was on her knees, in the cruelest agonies of suspense. On entering the sacristy, the Grand Duke, without speaking, prostrated himself on the ground. From this gesture the heart of the mnother guessed the truth, and a terrible stupor seemed to enchain oll her faculties; she could find neither words nor tears, The Grand Duke passed through the enclosure of the altar in order to stop tho service, and brought back with him her Confessor Krinltzkii, holding the crucifix in his hand, and who was in the act of concluding the prayers. It was not till then that the Empress, bowing to the ground before the crucifix, was able to shed the first tear. 'Suddenly,' writes an eye-witness of these events, 'when, after the loud cbanting of the choir, the church became suddenly still, and no sound wa b eard but the prayer pronounced in a low voice by the priest, there feU upon the ear a sort of gentle tap at the door-of the cause of it I am ignorant ; I only remember that I shuddered when I heard it, and that all who were in the church directed an gitated and inquirng look towards the doors ; no one, however, entered through them, and the circunmstance caused no interruption in the servlce, which did not, however, go on many minutes. The north doors opened; from the altar appeared the Grand Duke, as pale as death; he raised his hand to command silence; everything-was atill,and as it wero immoveable wlth suspense, but in an instant all seemed to understand at once than the Einperor was no more; the whole congregation uttered a kind of Inareculate exclamation. In a moment all was a itation; the whole crowd burst into one confused chorus or cries and sobs and weeping. Little by little the oongregation dispersed, and I remained alone. In the confusion of my thoughts I did not know where to go, and at last. as it were mechanically, instead of leaving the chapel by the usual door,I passed through the nortbern entrance to the altar. But what did I see there I The door leading to a side room was open. There the Empress Maria Feodorovna, almost In a state of insensibility, was lying in the arms of the Grand Duke; before her, on her knees, was the Grand Duchess Alexandra F6odorovna, imploring her to tranqullize herself-'Maman, chere mamao, an nom do Dleu, calmez-vons ' At thhis mont the priest takes th- e cross trom the altar, and, raising it on higb, approaches the door i on perceiviDg the oruofix the EmpreEs prostrates herseif before it to the ground, bowing her head to the Very floor close to tfhe feet of the priest. The unspeakable grandeur of this speotacle overpowered me ; carried away by my feelings, I fell on my knees before the sanctity of matermal grief, before the head of this Princess bowed to the dust under the Cross of a suffering Redeemer. ThE Empress, almost insensible, was lined up, placed in an armchair, and carried into the interior apartments; the dors closed bebind her. Then the Grand Duke Nicholas, with otber great functionaries, take the oath of allegiance to Constantine, whereupon the Empress and Gaitzin reproach him, and he, the person most interested, hears for the first time of the Will or Act of the late Emperor in hi3 behalf. Then begins what the compiler terms " that majestic episode in our history" in which history " departs from its eternal law, and offers the example of a hitherto unheard of struggle-a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation." The inconvenience, nevertheless, of this departure from eternal laws or ratber of this family contretemps, arising out of deficient arrangements and the disinclnation to confide in the public or each other was shortly experienced in the Council of the Empire, to whom Galitzln communicated the nature of the deposit at Moscow. Some were of one opinion and some of another, when Miloradovitch announced to them that Nicholas had set the example of swearing alleglance to Constantine, and, Nlcholas having confirmed this announoement in person, the oath was generaly taken in Constantines favour; Constantine was apprized of it by a letter from Nicholaa, edicts were issued in Constantine's name, while at the same time Constantine himself was sending from Warsaw to inform Nicholas that all this was an anachronism. Here, then, was a perplexity the very reverse of that which brought the noses of the two kings of Brentford into undesigned collision. INicholas was willing " to sacrifice himself and al that he holds dearest-domestic happiness and tranquillity-to obey the will of another." But how was he to accomplish this sacrifice when alegiance had been sworn to Constantine, and Constantine was not present to disclaim the unwelcome engagement? There is evidence cf Nicholas's perplexity and more than perplexity in his words, which are quoted:-" All might be still arranged, and might take a favourable turn, if the Cesarevitch would himself come to St. Petersburg; and it is only his obstinacy in reniaining at Warsaw that can cause calamities, the possibility of which I do not deny, and of which in al probability I shal myself fall the first victim." Aftera prolonged discussion, however,Nicholas determined to write to him, announcing that he was under the necessity of conforming to hia will, providing that that will were again and decisively announced. And he earnestly entreated the Cesarevitch to come to St. Petersburg, which entreaty waa Feconded by a letter from the Empress Mother. Conjectures were raised in St. Petersburg in the mean tilne by the fact that the Grand Dnke Michael, who bad arrived there, had not taken the oath of allegiance to Constantine; and, no doubt, these conjectures were as fuel to the fire of that party of whom so little is told us in this compilation, and who desired not only to swear allegiance to a new Emperor, " but to new laws." Thui party, which wEs founded in 1816, was now stirring, and desirous of a Constitution; and intelligence reached Nicholas at this time of a conspiracy which they were organizing, and which "overwhelmed him with unspeakable horror." Thereupon came a letter from Constantine at Warsaw, in answer to that of Nicholas, and brought by his messenger, from the first line of which Nicholas 'Isaw that his fate was sealed." Constantine stil refused the Empire and refused to come to St. Petersburg. How much furniture, glass, and china he had broken in tempestuous efforts to make up his mind thereto is not mentioned in the Imperial memoir, but those who are curious on such subjects may refer to M. Louis Blanc's Rlistoire de Dix Anzs, vol. ii, chap. 10, whence, on testimony which is there averred to be authentic, we make the inference that the upholsterer's bill was considerable. From the time of receiving his Ietter, however, "Nicholas Panlovitoh silenced in his heart, before his sacred debt to his country, the voice of self-preservation and self-interest; with a soul overflowing with the most pious confidence in Almighty Wisdom he yielded to its decree," and so became Emperor. The difficulty of communicating this in the face of an apprehended conspiracy, the arrangements made for the transfer of alegiance, the uncertainty as to the disposition of certain regiments, the final outbreak and conflict in the Senate Square, partly, no doubt, arising from tbis family misunderstanding, and the consequent ambiguity of the position of the real Czar, make up the remaining and larger portion of this volume. But no part of it, not excepting the " Solemn Communication" of Constantine to his countrymen, which came to light many years after his decease, and which is here printed in the appendix, explains the real mystery which snrrounds these transactione. What was the reason for the secrecy in which the arrangements out of which they sprang were originaUy enveloped? Why were these when known regarded so doubtfully and hesitatingly ? and why did Constantine refuse to come to St. Petersburg and duly authenticate the transfer of his right to the uccession ? By ordinary individuals this would be considered the course of busines. In this case it would have saved confusion and a great sacrifice of human life, and then no memoir of exculpation would have existed or been requisite. If these are the manners of Titans and Demigods, then the manners of Titans and Demigods have considerably degenerated. When Atlas, suffering from a spinal infirmity, requested Hercules to relieve him of his burden, he did not, that we are aware, chuck the globe at his toes without consideration for its pensive inhabitants. The presumption is that he handed it over to him gently and ceremoniously, with due consideration for Hercules and the terrestrial incumbents. Why the globe was so recklessly handled in this case that the streets of St. Petersburg ran red with gore is the mystery undisclosed. Its key may be for ever buried in the grave of Constantine, with the savage passions of his Kalmuck blood and gloomy brooding temperament. At all events, it is not forthcoming here; nor, we may add, does the consideration of the loss of human life appear to have induced the compilers of this volum^e to seek for it. They evidently had other objects in view, objects which are no doubt sufficiently attained if the blank is not yet filled up for the future historian.
SUPPOSED MURDBR IN BSSEX. Much excitement was caused on Saturday night in the neighbourhood of Colne Engaine, a village three or four miles from Halstead, by a report of the sudden and msns terious death of a respectable dealer in that parish, under euch supicious circumstances that little doubt is left on the mind of the public that a foul and coldblooded murder, accompanied by robbery, has been committed, almost in open daylight. Mr. Isaac B3utcher, the victim, is a respected inhabitant of Colne Engaine, where he has recently taken a small farm, besides carning on a somewhat extensive dealing in farning stock. The following is an outline of the circurm stances elucidated up to the present time, and -which, if corroborated upon oath, will bear out to a great extent the general opinion that the unfortunate deceased met his death by the hand of violence. It appears that on the morning of Saturday Mr. Butcher, in the ustal course of blusiness, attended Colohester market. After dining he obtained the offer of a ride home with Mr. Johnson, a dealer at Wakes Colne, who gave him " a lift" as far as Mr. Skingsley's farm, between two and three miles from his residence. Here he got out, and taking two or three paclkages of tea and other groceries walked on briskly towards home, apparentlyin his usual health. The deceased, after leaving Mr. Johnson, was met by several persons, who also observed two men following him at a short distance. When about 10 rods frora the spot where the alleged murder took place he was met bv a person named Hubbard, who bade him "good night," which he responded to and passed quickly on. A few steps further on the road Hubbard met a stranger, whom he alFo saluted, but received no audible reply; and clcse behind followed a second man, also unzknown. This was about 6 o'clock, and was the last oecasion on which the ?eoeased was seen alive. Two or three minutes past 6 Thomas Butler, the under-gardener to Mr. Robert Hills. late High Sberiff of Essex, was crossing the Colne-park, and -%hen at the distanee of about e0 yards from the road which I ounds the Park groutnds he heard a noise apparently of persons scuffling. Thinking it arose probably from persons ntoxicated, be walked on quietly to the lodge-gate, which is within a stone's throw of the spot. Pasinzg through the gate, wbich closed loudly after him, and probably alarmed the murdierers, he walked towards deceased, stopping when albout halfway to listen for a moment, when he distinctly heard the footsteps of more than one person running in a directionfromhim. Butlerssnspicions werearoused, and he then commenced running at the top of his speed, and to his horror, instantly on turning the corner, discovered deceased lying on his back by the side of the road. The head, which was lying nearest Colne Engaine, bis intended destination, was smeared with bloed, and his clothes were in a very disordered state, the waistcoat and underclothes being open. his sbirt partly up, and his high boots pushed down to the miiddle of the calf. Ha8tily rmaling these general observations, Butler ran to the next turnming, when he once more heard footfalls near the plantation, some distance off. Soon after, thinldng it dangerors to go further in puruit alone, he retraced his steps and sought for assistanCe. In the meantime and before he returned with help, Mr. J. J. Mayhew, jon., drove up with the deceased's brother, and, observing the body of a man in the road, Mr. Butcher alighted, and raising it up recognizedwith what feelings may be imagined-the corpse of his Medical assistance was Immediately but frautlessly obtained; the deceased was quite dead. On examination it was discovered that he bad received a wound on the forehead, but whether sufficient of Itself to cause death must be a point for medical inquiry. It is said that deceased had a quantity of both gold and silver in bis possession, but not a coin of any description was found upon the body. After Ieocaping from the scene of the murder it Is presumed that tbe two men -who are sapposed to have committed the atrocious act made their way across the country, as footprints of two persons bave been found leading from a gate on the roadside over a field of tares, through a fallow field, z nd a portion of a field of mangold wurtzel, whence they appear by marks on the sand to have leaped over a hedge into the adjoining meadow, but here unfortunately all traces cease. The alleged murderers are thus vaguely described by the witnesses, as far as they were able to judge in the dusk of the evening:-Thetaller man wore acordnroy jaoket and trousers of a light appearance. His companion, on the contrary, waS dressed in a black coat buttoned up to the chin; he wore, moreover, a dark wideawa'ke, and it was remarked that he possessed a beard and moustache. The county polce are making active exertios to discover these persons, and we trust that it guilty thev will bo brought to speedy justice. It is but right to add that deceased suffered from disease of the heart, which ha been suggested by some persons aM the cause of hts death. He had just entered his 45th year, and leaves a widow and sI children ito lAMent his untimely end. Very great exitement prevails in the neighbourhood, and tbe isnityof his death baa been visited by hundreda of pet, cOnS axous to obtin a vlewe i ihe fatal spot,
SIrR BRLyVJA3I.f HAUL AZD TBE WELSH FARAfAIS. A few days ago Sir Banjamin Hall, NLP., the firt com. missioner of Works and Pablic BaUidings, now on a visit to his seat at Llanover, ia Meonmothshire, presided at the annual meeting and dinnerof tha Abergavenny Agricultural A.sociation, held in that town. There was a well-contested ploughing match in the early part of the day, and an exhi. b2tion of cattle and sheep, horses, implements, and poultry. Prizes given by the Earl of Ahergavenny, Sir Benjamin Hail, and Colonel Clifford, M.P., were also awarded for the test specimens of garden culture, and for which there vas a trong competition. The dinner, at which about 120 perons were present, took place at the Angel Hotel, and tho company was comnposed chiefly of the neighbouring gentry and farmers. The usual formal toasts having beea drunk, Sir B. HALL said,-Haring gone through the general routine of toasts I wil now propose the toast of the evening; and, as it is usual on all similar occasions for the person who fill the chair to make aome prefatory remarks in introducing the sentiment of prosperity to the association over which he presidea, I will endeavour to make some observations which shaU be brief in character, avoiding as much as possible the example set by some other gentlemsn who preside at meetings smilar to thia, aud endeavouring directly to confine rnyself to the object in view. I shall eschaw all political observations, because they are not only distasteful to myself, bat are neither congenial nor apposite to the occasion which has brought as together. We have heard from the judges this evening that they are well satified with the progress which this institution has made, and they haTe expreased their approbation, not only of the stock and crops, but also of the ploughing which they have witnessed. Now, I have lived in this county all my life, and I have a great stake and interest ia it. I have watched the progress of civilization, of manufacture, and of agriculture, and Iam quite sure that no county has made greater advances in agriculture during my lifetime than this. I will tell you an anecdote that I he&rd my father relate very often. About 45 years ago he endeavoured to persuade his tenantry in the hilly district to grow turnips, that their sheep and cattle might eat them. He was told in very strong and emphatic language by the inhabitants of the distiect that a Welsh sheep would not look at a turnip, and Would scorn to eat one. (A laugh.) The difficulty was to overcome that prejudice and induce the people to grow turnips in order that. their sheep might eat them and prcsper more. He took the wisest course. We are all Wel3hmen here, and I shall not be speaking disre3pectfully-being one of them-it I say that it is of no use whatever to drive a Welshman. You may lead him, bat it is imnossible to drive him; and, moreover, it is always be'tUr to use persuasion than compulsion, and to appeal rather to a man's good sense than endeavour to force him to do that which is contrary to h}s own wishes and prejudices. This reminds me that a drcumstnce occurred the other day which annoyed me very much. I happened to make a road through a art of my estate at Abercasne, and I found there a remarkably fine beech tree; bht its fine silvery bark bad proved too strong a temptation to the knives of the idlers, who had inscribed their names and their rude lore songs upon the tree. It was perfectly covered with all kinds of bleroglyphics, which offended my eye. As to putting up a notice that mantraps or spring guns were laid to prevont Welshmen from cutting the tree, I knew that would unse. less; so I put up a notice, written both in Welsh and English, 'None bat fools will inscribe their names upon thi tree." (A laugh.) Thus appealing to their good sense, and they not wishing to be included in the category of fools, my tree now remains unmolested by every gentle swain, and no rustic Viludns has since attempted to address his Dlnah by writing upon it. (Laughter.) Bau that Is rather a digression, and we will go back to the turnips 3y father was determined to convinoe his tenants that Welsh sheep would eat turnips; so, on the top of a hill, on the very highest point of his estate, he bad a very fine field of turnlps. It was walled round, and a strong fence was nut on the top of the wall, with a kind of chasaux de frse, to prevent those very nimble quadrupeds, the Welsh sheep, from getting over and destroying the crop. Wel, the turnips grew, and winter came; the sheep began to flock about the roads, and the cheraux defrie was taken down. Over ijmped the Welsh sheep (a laugh), and of course in a few days the field was filled with them My father was apprised that this was the case, and he ponded all the sheep. That was very heinous offence for a landlord to commit towards his tenants, hut he put a very high price upon the damage that had been done. They complained very much about it, but he bagged to assure them that the businese did not concern them; that it could not be their sbeep that were pounded; for he had it upn the word and honour of Welshmen that their sheep wouldo not so much as look at a turnip. (Laughter.) This had the desired offect, and at last my father consented to have the sheep released from the pound upon the owners declaring that, on tbEir consclences, the Welsh sheep would eat turnips. (A laugh.) That was the commencement of turnip.growing at Abercarne. We may come to a later date when, with younger men than myself, I went partridge shooting. We wanted a field of turnips, but the dificulty was to find one. However, when we diefind one we always had good sport, for it was excessively foul, and we generalky knew it more by its beautiful yellow tinge than by the beautiful groen it ought to show- and when we got the partridges into the turnips we always had better sport, because instead of running into the straight lines made br the drills, they went through the tortuous windlass of broadcast, which made it better for us, but not so well for the farmer. (Laughter.) Now we can find in the county as good fields of turnips as any in Norfolk or Lincolnshire, owing to the stimulas glvon to agricalture by societies each as theae, and the desire thus created among farmers to compete with those in the more favoured districts. (Cheers.) I am happy to think that this society goes on improving. This is the first time I ever had the honour of being preseRt at one of tbese meetings; and it may very natarally be asked, " Why is it that 3 ou, a landed proprietor In the county, and who bave an important stake in ariculture, have not been preeent at thesemeetinga before For the last tbree years, owing to various circumstauces; it has been impossible for me to be present. I allude to daties of a high character which I have to perform; but, besides, I would not attend these meetings because Imight have beenlookeduponratther asablack sheep in the flock. ("No,no.") Idoenot alludeoto this particular meeting, but there are meetings held in this kingdom of this description where a person cannot enter unless he is what is called a " farmer's friend," and unle3s he happens to hold some peculiar political tenets. RAther than throw the apple of discord into the society I stayed away from company in which I should have been extremely happy to mix, feeling certin that theday wouldarrive when political opinions would be merged on such occasions and I should be able to come among you and take my place among the farmers of this country. (Cheers.) I think that, althoueh entertaining strong opinions on certain points, it would ll become me to obtrude them here; and I hope that during the time I have been in this cbhir I have, by refraining from so doing, set an example that will be followed. May we never have meetings like this obtruded upon by matters of that character, and may the one effort be to support the toast, "Prosperity to the Abergavenny Agricultural Association." (Cheers.) At a later period of the evening Sir Benjamin, in responding to the toast of his health, gave a general invitation to the inspection of his farm, and promised that those who came should be supplied with every information that could be given. Withlu the last 43 years he said he had converted a desert waste into a fruitful source of produce, and where briars and farze and rank weeds grew they might recently have seen corn growing in aoundance, and might now see the stacks of corn which did grow there; and they would see, too, as good fields of turnips as any that had been entered for competition this year. of course this had been a matter of cost and thought and toil; but during the time when it pleased God to visit him with a great affliction-during the time he was deprived of sight, and while he was unable to take part in the healthful pursuits he before enjoyed-to go across the country, or stalk a stag, or knock over a grouse-farming became his pursuit, and had over since been his pleasure up to the present time. And now, when he was relieved from the more anxious duties which belouged to his position it was a pleasure to come down to Llanover ; and if, by means of the example he had set he had done any goodin his Ephere he was thankful for it, and he hoped that that exasple, as far as it Was good, might be foUowed by others and be beneficial to them. If what he had done could be made of any avail by examination let them come and examine it by all means, and he should be happy to see them. and eplain wrhat he had done in detaiL. At aU eventa, if they did uot follow his example, they would admire the results of his system, for they would see now a smiling farm where formerly there was a disgraceful swamp. (Cheers). The meeting was also addressed by Colonel Clifford, MhP.,, and several of the local gentry present on the occasion.

DOCK ALTARATIO. AND EXVERSION. BIRKENHEND V. TXTVRD1Pnnrt At te cncluionof te odinry business bafore the Liverpool Dock Committee on Thursday last wr. CHiARLES TUI1sER, the chairman, said they had now arrived a' the important matter which had been deferred for a fortnightthe plan shoving an alteration of tho Brunswick and of tho usklsson Dock As they would recollect, there was a mnenorial fronm the Liverpool Shipowners' Association, a letter from Mr. George Booker, ancx acommunecation from the Chamber of Commerce, aud they had since received sEveral additional communicationg, which had better be read. Memorials were then read from merchants and traders interested in the timber trade, calling attention to the inoonvenience and loss sustained in conseqnence of the inadequate accommodation afforded at the port for ca,n7. on their business, and urging that the accommodation ao Jong promised at the nortb end of the towrn should be rovided; from a number of tbe leading shipbrokers loading at the port, asking for improved accommodation by the extension of the docks on the Lirerpool side of the Mersey; from a nnuber of the leading morchants, ahip owners, and brokers engaged in the trade with the Untted States, urging the necessity for greatly extonded dock and qnay space on the Liverpool side, and expressing a s rong conviction that the contemplated completion of the Birken. head Docks would afford them no relHef, those docks being, in their opinion, unsuited to the general bmuiness of the port, and especially to the American trade, which was necessarily concentrated on the Liverpool side of the river. from a number of merchants, shipowners, smelters anl others interested in the trade of copper and sUrer ore, submitting the necessity of applyiog in the ensuing Parliament for powers of dock extension, to enable the committee to give Increased facilities, not only to the particular branch of trade in which the memorialists are all interested, bht also to the general commerce of the port; and from other merchants in Liverpool, engaged prizcipally in the Mediterranean and Levant trade, urging upon the dock committee that if further moneys are raised for dock mrposee, they should be employed in increasing the acoon-4 mnodation on both side4A the Mersey, but more particularly on the Liverpool side. A memorial from a numberof tradesmen and others at the South end, was read, praying for the continuance of tha Brunswick as a timber dock. A letter from tir. Eyre Evans, a member of the committee confined at home by illness, was recived by the chairman. It protested against the proposed alterations of the Branswick dock, which would sacrifice existing dock water space to a supposed increase of qUy room, and dwarf the accommodation for ships, stable like, into stslls. Mr. BARBER at great length urged that it would be folly to go agan to Parliament in the present state of mnatters, and expoeed again to a rebuff. He was surprised at the American trade, for he could not see why Birkenhead vras not as well adapted for it as this side of the river - and what a great relief iLt would be to the docks here If they would proceed with the works at Birkenhead, where they might nave 80 acres ready almogt instaner- but impediments seemed anxiously thrown in the way. i object was that they should not expose themselves to Parliament, and be sent hack and told that they had the means of remedying all those alleged deficiencies at hand, and were not disposed to use them. Air. BOLD, that they might be perfectly in order, called for the resolrtion of the committee to whom this subject had been remitted to be read. The CHUAIMAX said it as submitted a fortnight ago, and its consideration deferred tUIl to-day. The resolution was-Plans were submitted " showving an alteration of the Brunswick Dock and the Huskisson Dock, and we recommend these alterations to be included in the notice of apply. ing to Parliament next session." That was from a special committee on dock and graving dock accommodation. The proposed alteration shovred a cut out of the Huskiswn Dock and an alteration of the Brunswick Dock, which it was proposed to divide into three. lr. LocKE; said the morcantilo and shipping interest having expressed their opinions, which they had done fully, be begged to move as an amendment that the matter be referred hack to the special sub-committee to reconsider, taking these memorials also into consideration. Mr. RoBIXSoX seconded the motion. Mr. HOLWIE thought If they were compelled to go Immediately for the completion of the Birkenhead works an injury might he done to the trade of this port. Those works had cost 1,140,0001., and the carrying out of the plans which had been proposed would involvo an outlay of nearly three milllona of money. And what he looked at vwas tho time occupied, if all the works at Birkenhead were to be carried out. He did not think they would be executed in less than five yearg. M1r. HARTLEY said the shortest time would be seven or eight years. Mr. Ho%mE asked what was to become of the commerce during that period ? He was rather struck wlth the remark In Mr. Evans's letter, that if they took the Branswick Dook they would bo destroying that which might be for some timo longer a benefit to the trade of the port. He thonght it desirable that they should go on with such works as were Immediately required for the commerce and the interest of Mh'r HALUEAD admitted that the feeling of the timber trade was altered, but it was under the impression that tho accomumodation at the north end would be on a liberal scale Ba to rates. We thought it inexpediont that the trade should be divided. Mr. HOL3Sb hoped it would not go forth that there was ay destre not to proceed with the Birkenbead works. It could not be supposed that they were wishful to have a million and a half of property lying idle any longer. The C1A1R3I.UT said the question was as to how far the memorialists wished them to proceed as one of themselves. p Mr. MoSNDEL said he had always advocated that the land on the east side of Haskisson Dock should be appropriated for steam purposes. The steam shipping had doubled itself within the last five years, and wras likely to g on at the same ratio. It now occupied about 42 acres of the whole dock space, and if they oould provide on the west aide of the Brunswick accommodation for 360,000 tons that would meet a great many of the requirements for some time to come on this side of the water. He thought tbey would do wrong in hampering their successors with any plans, and if theZ called for more than was necessary they would fail in their object. The motion of Mr. Lockett was then agreed to; and this being thew hole of the business tho meeting broke up. A special meeting of the Birkenbead Commissioners was held yesterday (Friday) morning, when the chairman, Mr. John Laird, read some lotters from the directors of the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Junction and the Great Western Rxilway Comipa. Dies, advising that they should hold a confer-nce, with the view of ascertaining what steps sbould be taken to compel the Liverpool Corporation or the Liverpool Dock Trustees to proceed 'with the completion of the Birkenbead Docks as required by the Mersey Conservancy Act of last session. He explained that notwithstanding that the dock committee hadbeen defeated for the last three years in their attempts to force an extension of the dock space on the north shore on the Liverpool side, Parliament ad refused to grant permission to enable them to do so, and had bound them down to complete a certain portion of the Birkenhead Docks by September next. In spite of this, however, the Liverpool corporation had agreed to a report by Mr. Hartley, their engineer, who had advised that certain changes should be made in the plans, which cbhages Mr. Laird asserted would postpone the opening of the Birkenhead Docks for an indefinite time, and would inflict great injury upon Birkenhead, while at the samo time there was a great outcry from the comnmercial community for more dock accommodation, which he said could be more easily and economically provided by the completion of the Birkenhead scheme than by the proposed dock extensions at Liverpool. A resolution w&s ultimately adopted sanc ioning the proposed conferenco between a deputation of the commissmoners and a special committee of the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Junction and the Great Wetern RAilway Companies, with power to confer with the Man. chester Chamber of Commerce and other parties on the question. The Law Clerk was also authorized to give notice for an application to be made to Parliament for the purchase of the Birkenhead Gas and Water Works, and for the construction of any new works that might be necessary.
THE SA,ITARY COMIMISSION ON THE SEAT OF WAR IN' ThE EAsr.-A thick blue-book, of 300 pages, Issned on Saturday, contains the report of the proceedings of the Sanitary Commission despatcbed by Lord Panmnure to theseat of war in the East (1865 56). It is of course impossible to give more than a cursory notice of this valuablo and interesting document. The practical conclusions of tho commission are these,-that the defective ventilation and consequently foul atmosphere of the hospitals on the Bosphorus were sufficient to account for a large proportion of the excess of mortality amorn the sick and the outbreak of cholera among the troops In November, 1855 ; that the had sanitary condition of the town and harbour of Bala!:lava and the vicinity was the cause of much siekness, and that the local causes of disease were essentiaUy tho same as those which are observed to predispose to epidemic and pestilential diseases elsewhere; that, aa regards transport ships, the best course to be pursned when sickness prevails on board is to remove the infected vessels into the open sea, and out of the vitiated atmosphere of the port ; and that by far the greater part of the disease and mortality existing in the camp when the commissioners arrived out In the Crimea was due ro zymotic maladies, such as cholera, fever, dysentery, and diarrhnva, t'e causos of disease being chiefly damp, impure air, and (in a minor degree) impure water. A wet subsoil, a retentive (of wet) surfa~e soil, and a confined locality were alwavs connected with attacks of zymotlo diseasFe, and the ev'ls arising from local causes of dampness w ere of'ten aggravated by the manner of pitching tents and erecting huts. AS the result of their whole experience the commissioners express their opinion that, inasmuch as the neglect of military hAgiPnc4 whether as regsrds the soldier personaUy or the sanitary state of camps. barracks, and hospitals, has hitherto, in all countriese climates, and seasons, been the cause of the largest amount of loss in armies, the wholo subject demands in future a p-actical development commensurate with its Importanee to the pubEic service. The appendix to the report contains papers on the topography and geology of the Eeat of war, and on cooking ard clothing, besides abstracts of diaries and journals from the pens of Dr. Milray, Dr. Sutberland, Mr. Walling, Dr. Smart, aad Messrs. Newlands, Freeney, and Aynsloy. A WHALJ 3 STRAA-DED AT SCAuuOROUC,u.The Yorkshir-c G4adU says:-" On Monday last a young whale, of the species Balcrnoptevr Borqual, was discoverea on the rocks behind the outer pier at Scarborough. Yt is supposed to have been left there by the tide of the previous night, as it wa quite dead when found. This monster was upwards of 30f. in length, and nearly 14tt. In idrcumfrence at the thickest part Of the body. A party of fishermen who found the prize soon commeonced the wor; of disotion.

UYA-V.El?&A-z- (lA URRZlnil. Nat. o The Vice-Chancellor met the t members of the Senate 1c the Art Scbools at 2 o'clock to-day. The first subject brought under dLscusslon was the prof posed new statute respecting the Lady MArgaret Professar. spi of Divinity. ,ter some prdiminary observations from the Vice-0ha. Ir. ROBY, of St. John's, said he thought, in disposing of thererenues of thoee parithes which conAtltuted the en. dowment of the Lady Margaret' Professorship, something ought to be done for the parishes themselses, considering the Inadequate endowment of the vicar.ges. The VICR-CHAMCELLOR said this had oocupiea the attention of the Council on more than one occasion, and they came to the conclusion that it was not competent for them to recommend anything vitb reference to the perishes. The MAsiTmn Of ST.

No amendment being moved, the Vice-Chancellor passed on to the proposed statute for founding a SadleriAn Profes. sorhip in plac of Lady SadTler's Lectubras, the object being to found a now Profesorship, and to aulment the Lacaian and Plumian Professorships. Mr. REqyNiti, of St. John's, was alteguetber opposed to the statute. He considered it neither last n3or proper to divert the fonds of Lady SaAler's foundatton from their oginal prpose, which was to teach alEbra in the different colleges, and from which the best results ha arisen. Mr. PanRE, of Emmanueil thought the banefit to the University from the est-ablishment of such a Professorship would depend on hislecourfs comprithe thoe higher branches of mathematics; and he subsrquenty moved an amendmnent to that effect. Mr. H. Goo£wel commented at length on the observations of Mr. Reyner. Teaching algebra was the duty of a college tutor under any circwmstance The augmentation of the Lucasian Professorship tecthis approbation. Tho precent Professor was one of the most learned men in Euope, buxt from the smallness of his stipend, he was unable to reside; and one of the pzincipal objects to be attained, if possible, was a staff of eminent resident Profes'ors The VrcldseA cnLLon did not thank the terms of the proposed statute would confine the Pro!sssor to algebra mr. rHspa here moved his amendnent. The manner of electing the proposed Professr next occupied the Sitnting. Mr. Roy thought the Counnl too numerous, and advo. cated a board of non-resident electors similar to that pro. posed by Sir W. Hamilton. The VicE-Cn&,mELnoR said nothing ha,d aivn the Council more anxiety than the election of these P.ofessors, but after the nuxmerous schemes which had been propounded they could devise no other method than that proposed. Other spakiers addressed the meeting, which was ad. journed to Saturday next, at 2 o'clock.
POLICE (BNGAL PME IDE-CY).OU Saturday appeared a copy of a dospatch from the Governor.General of India to the Dlreotors of the East India Company (dated the 14th of May, lS51, ith a heap of enclosures. relating to the system of pollee inthoBengal Presidenoy. In tbe despatch oftho 14th of Maythe Indian Governmentinform tbo Dirctors of their unanitnous opinion that the appointment of one superintendent of police for the whole of thelowerprovinosE is not expedient, and they consider the existing system of dividing the cointry into manageable tracts of four or five districs, and placing each districtunder tho euperlntendence of a conmissioner having authority in all xecutivx artments, inclusive of the police, as the best hich has yet beenr devsed for India, and one which works well both in Bengal and elsewherh. They agree generally in the view of the Governor-General (expressed in his minuto) sg to the extent to which it is desirable that a military organization should be given to the pollce of Bengal, and they opine that a nioveable corps of station guards, or military police, should be attached to each aivison, ready to assist the civil forco in case of need, The minute of the Governor-General, of the 18th of February, 1857, contained the folloving proposals :-L That the police of Bengal ho reorganized at once without waiting for a plan applic ble to the whole of India. 2. That there bo no general superintendent of police for Bengal, but that the ice bo superintended, as at present, by the comTisso0ners of divisions acting under the general control of the Government. 3. That the police of Bengal be not organized after a military fashion, but that two, or perhaps three additional corps of station guards be formed to protect the offioes, gaois, and treasuries, to furnish escorts, and to sid the regular polieo In case of need. 4. That the salaries of the mohurirs, jemadars, and burL-undanzes be raised, as proposed by the Lleutenant-Governor, at an annual additional expense of 3,38,609 rupees. 5. That special salaries be assigned to deserving darogabs, at a mnximum annual cost of 30,000 rupees. 6. That either covenanted officers or uncovenauted deputy magistrates be placed in chargo of subdivisions, conslsting of from three to four thannahs each, and that 90 mombers be added to the subordinate executive service at au increased annual expense of 4,12,800 rupees. 7. That the office of magistrate and collector wh:re now disunited in Bengal should be combined in the same person, and that such of the covenanted officers as are now magistra'es and are not absorbod in the higher office, should be employed as joint rmaistrates and deputy-collectors, but without sny increase of salary. S. That the joint magistratein exch diitriet should ordinarily have the superntendence of the police under the general control of the magistrats. 9. Thst the deputy maoistrates exeroise judlcial as well as policoe povers, 10. That the moonsifla generaUy be vested with the criminal powers of an assistant magistrat, and with snch higher powers as the local Governmeat may think proper to confer in particular cases. 11. That the proowedings of the subordinate courts be made as summary as possible, and that there be no appeat of right; and 12. That the local Government be authorlzed to vest respectable residents of the interior with the powers of an Assistant magistrate.

LONDON, TUESDAY, NOVEJfBER 3, 1857. Lord SHAFTESBURY'S speech at Wimborne is worthy of the patriotism, the religion, the warm sympathies, and the sterlinig zeal which have always been connected with his name. On a subject like the Indian Mutiny, on which everybody has been expressing himself for months in almost the same words, genuine heart alone can speak with freshn6Ss. In the hardening process of repetition we lose the edge of our feeling ; even the greatest hlorrors, by being perpetually brought before us, become matters of course, and we find ourselves unable to recover our first strong inipressions, except somebody renews them for 'us by the force of a more retentive realizing sympathy. Lord SHAFTrsBTuny's speech reads as if the new3 of the Indiaa outrages had only reached us yesterday, and he were givillg his very first impressions. Yet there is nothing extravagant or unguarded in his style. Nothing can be more just or moderate than what he says about punishment, and we are glad that he has called attention to that part of General WPLsoN's address to the troops. How simple and just is 'Qeneral WLasoN's settlement of this question,- cNo quarter to the rautineers; spare the women "and children r1 This is the proper, natural com]i-nation of justice and mercy. NVhat are people disputing about on this subject? Will any one say that this order of General WrLsoN's is savage 2nd inhuman ? If nobody will, then all we can say is that we, for our part, are satisfied with it. Jlave we ever said a single word more _n this question than that the guilty parties in this mutiny should be punished? Have we ever said that we wanted the innocent to be punished? General WILSON'S distinction, then, satisfies us. Let those v hom it does not satisfy hold up their hands. None will venture to do this publicly, though a few-a very few we hope, but we are afraid a few-will secretly and in their hearts not like it. These gentlemen talk about justice because they know that the country will not tolerate the omission of all reference whatever to justice. But it would be very difficult to propound any definite course of justice whatever that they would not thinjk severity. The truth is, there are a few among us,-we Fre reluctant to deseribe them more particularly, because, having no hostile feeling towards them, we do not want to direct hostile notice to them ; if they recognize themselves it is all that we want,-a few there are, we say, of whom we must express the real apprehension that party disappointments, isolation, and want of sympathy with the dominant religious feeling of the country have so warped and irritated them that their patriotism is now reduced to very moderate dimensions, and in danger of still further reduction. If some of these gentlemen fairly examined themselves they would confess to the existence of a considerable doubt whether they really and in their hearts wanted English power and influence to maintain and spread themselves in the world or not. Why should they? They think the great mass of the English people deeply and fundamentally wrong on the subject of religion, they oppose the general currert of English legislation, they suspect and criticize all established English principles and maxims, they separate themselves in opinion and feeling from the English people on all the most serious and cardinal questions in their own scale of importance. It is quite true they have no objection to the improvements of modem art and science, to railways and the penny postage, clean streets, air and watertight houses, good ventilation, and all our sanitary and physical advancement, but their union with England is in hard externals; their separation from her is in tender internal points; their sympathy is superficial, their disagreement is deep. Such relations of opinion and feeling to their country must affect patriotism; it is not possible but that in the nature of things it should. In your wishes for the maintenance and spread of a nation's power you must be influenced by the consideration how far you think that nation right or wrong on important points. If you think it wrong, then the growth of its power cannot be a matter of simple congratulation to you. Persons cannot separate these two resilts Opinion must modify patriotism. You cannot think the great mass of your countrymen in vital error, and wish exactly the same success and influence to your copntry that you would if you thought differently and sympathized with the national temper and creed. Wherever the influence of your country spreads you may be quite sure that there spreads an influence adverse, on the whole, to your own particular views, and giving extension and prominence to other and counter ones. The growth of a nation is the spread of a creed ; it cannot he!p being so; however compietely and heartily the aim may be disavowed, it must in effect be fulfilled. Our conquests and our colonizations, the very triumphs of our commerce, the very growth o. our manutfactures, are an unconscious propagation of a religion. Wherever English power spreads the faith of the mass of the English people spreads with it. We may disclaim the intention ever so much, aud, indeed, no object can have been less aimed at than this, but we cannot help the result, becsuse whereever we go we take our own heart, temper, and creed with us. In this point of view the colonial growth of England is incidentally a propaganda, and a most vigorous one; it is all to nothing the very largest propagation of a religion which is now going on in the world. Some of our querulous fiiends, then, who complain so bitterly of the natural indignation of the English public on this occasion, and who stigmatize the general call for justice as a cry for vengeance, may disown the motive-they may not even realize it exactly to themselves, but we cannot help referring some of their dissatisfaction to this source. This demonstration of public feeling frets them, because'they are not, in fact, one with the English public. They feel very little general symPathy with it, and want of sympathy makes us bard critics. " After all, what "are we maling such a noise about? What if "vulgar, commercial, Protestant England has "received a snub, and has been insulted and "outraged on her own Imperlal ground,-what "business has she to make such an out- cry?" These fastidious gentlemen feel themselves unable to join heartily in a patriotic demonstration, because they feel at the bottom a want of sympathy with the English people. We all know how difficult we are to please, and what unfavourable judges we are of a man's behaviour, when we are prejudiced against the man. Then nothing that the unfortunate man can do avails him; be cannot stand, or sit, or speak, or look, without giving offence; if he speaks louder than a whisper he is a bear, if he laughs he is an hyena, if he utters a sentiment he is a coxcomb, and if he displays the slightest warmth of feeling he is a firebrand. Whatever the poor creature does, he is sure to be vulgar, outrageous, and disgusting. This is the sort of criticism that the English public has been meeting with from a small, fastidious, and uncongenial school. It has been voted outrageous and brutal, vulgar and arrogant, bloodthirsty and revengeful. Why? Because it has simply asked for stern justice for horrible outrages. Really and truly, we are not aware that anything more has ever been asked for or wished for. We lnow that when a whole nation speaks out individuals maysometimes say things that they had better not say. No sensible manwill expeet that in a time of extraordinary excitement, when every feeling is justly up in arms, people will always measure tbe exact force of every syllable. But, allowing for sueh exceptions, the public feeling of this country has, on the whole, spoken out, though very strongly, still guardedly, and has shown great decision, but not extravagance. Any judicious ear would observe a clear limit and measure in the very highest climax of expression. At no stage of this just excitement of the public mind would any proposal to pumish innocent Hindoos, simply to strike terror, bave been received with any other feeling than that of horror. Under such circumatances some cautions may be wanted, and we should not object to tbem, but we are very sure that a captious, carping, petty, jealous, irritable criticism is quite ouit of place.
We have repeatedly as'erted both the policy and feasibility of maintainh.g in India such a force of British troops as would at any time be competent to overpower, and consequently at all times to ovErawe, any native levies, whatever might be their description or character. This we believe to be the fundpmental principle of sound Indian administration. That the system would be practicable enough can surely not admit of a doubt in the face of the s,cenes before our eyes. If a weak contingent of less than 20,000 men, aided only by about half as many more collected from various quarters, could hold their own against an organized body of 100,000 arm2ed rebels-men picked for tieir military aptitudes, equipped with excellent weapons, and drilled by ourselves-if a garrison of 500 or 000 Europeans can maintain themselves for months together against all the insurrectionary fulry of one of the chief provinces of Elindostan, how is it possibly to be affirmed that we cannot keep in India a force sufficient for its protection and control, when there will be no r,uch Sepoy army to oppose us ? 'We have reBisted the worst conceivable expression of Indian revolt 'With an unusually weak army. We have but to strengthen that army on the one hand, and demolish the chances of revolt-i.e., suppress the Sepoy battalions, on the other, and our rule will be seeure. $uch a systeml, lhowe7er, would requirQ cgi. siderable modifications in many departments of Indian administration, and especially in the regulations touching military service in those parts. If the European force in India is to be materially increased, it must be upon conditions more favourable to those employed than have hitherto prevailed. It is not probable that the necessary changes, if well undertaken, would involve any serious difficulty, for the tendency of things has been for many years in the direction to which we refer. Sixty or seventy years since service in India was almost equivalent to expatriation for life. The voyage was so long and so costly as to be accepted only once and for all; Indian habits were so peculiar as to unfit men for a return to European society, and Englishmen adopted permanently a species of Asiatic character with an Eastern abode. Furlough regulations were, perhaps, necessarily rigorous, and nothing was so difficult as to revisit England. Australia, the Cape, any place almost, I might be selected for a change at a less cost than home, so that in the end military service in those parts came to be regarded as something altogether different from soldiering in general. A man would I go with his regiment to other countries in the natural coiuse of things, but go:ng to India was like embarking in a new profession, or taking up with entirely new prospects for life. Experience has now shown us that thele is no real ground for any of these distinctions. Service in India ought to be as agreeable as service anywhere else-indeed, more so than on many stations. It is only at particular spots and seasons that the heat ii excessive; there need be no confinement or monotony, and we have recently learnt by unexceptionable proof that the climate, even in the greatest heats of summer, admits of laborious campaigning without much prejudice to health. We have probably been overapprehensive in this respect, and thrown away our pains. It was stated in letters from the Camp before Delhi that the men were not only none the I worse, but visibly and strikingly the better, for the i exertions they had undergone; and that the percentage of sickness, after all their marches and bivouacs, was considerably less than it used to be in summer cantonmel ts. Nornmust it be forgotten that in future railroads will enable long marches to be in a great degree dispensed witb, will facilitate change of quarters, and give easy access to healthy stations. Add to this that the soldier is now better cared for as rega'ds the adaptation of his accouitrements t. his duties, and that all conditions conducive to his robustness and efficiency are more scrupulously observed than formerly. The precautions of our euthorities will suffice against anything but an irresistible climate, and a climate can hardly be irresistible where one great complaint of the service is that officers grow too old in it to be fit for work. But there is one special consideration most imperatively suggestive of reform in the system of which we speak. If Englishmen are kept too long in India not only does the efficiency of the force suffer, but the individual character becomes impaired. A race which governs by virtue of its inherent superiority cannot be too tenacsous of its attributes. Englishmen in India should be purely Englishmen, not Anglo-Indians. They should retain all their national qualities, not merely half of them, and it is manifest that this is most likely to happen when England and India are brought most effectually into communication 'With each other. The old fable of AzNTzuTS fits the case exactly. Our countrymen should return as often as possible to their country, and gather fresh vigour and nationality from the contact. As soon as the character begins to yield to the influences of Eastern life, life in England should restore its tone. A very celebrated Indian officer, Colonel Jonx JACOB, appreciated so keenly the desirability of this revivifying process that he advocated the establishment of a " Salbatical year"-i.e., the assignment of one year out of seven to the work of reinvigoration. His opinion was, that by such an observance the British officer would be enabled to retain unimpaired and in full activity those peculiar qualities to which Hindoo and Mussulman paid the involuntary homage of political submission, and which must always and necessar:ly lie at the foundation of our rule in India. We have said that things have recently been tending in this direction, and it would be easy to multiply illustrations of our remark. Service in the East, even now, is not so protracted as formerly; tre'nsport is far more rapid, communication is infinitely easier. This, however, is not all. A variety of other circumstances has been combining to bring the two countries together. Indian affairs have been discussed in the press -with far greater ability and in Parlianent with considerably greater interest than of old-in fact, we hare now examples of statesmen who have actually seen India wvithout having been in the Company's employ. A short time, we may trust, will enable us to establish telegraphic communication with our Indian empire, and when that is accomplished, and tlhe overland route made more generally available, there will really be no reason why service in India should not be thought just as acceptable and just as much a matter of routine as service in Canada or Gibraltar. How, indeed, can a country to which wehave just despatchedl30,000 men in the course of three months be regarded as beyond the sphere of ordinary military duties? It would be very desirable also that the visits of Hindoos to this country, of which we have already had several examples, should be multiplied as much as possible. One would think that when a Brabmin finds himself entirely free from religious solicitation, though alone among 30,000,000 Christians, he will cease to believe in our anxiety to destroy his caste in his own land,-not to mention that the unmistakeable tone of public opinion would greatly conduce to his tranquillity. A Hindoo in England would learn that even among the most ardent propagators of the Gospel there did not and never would exist the Slightest desire to extend Chrisi-anity by compulsion; he would ! hear nothing but vise and benevolent wishes expressed with respect to the destinies of his countrymen, and could scarcely fail of being convinced that he had nothing to fear, though much to hope, from British dominion. This, however, would probably be a work of time, but we see nothing that need stand in the way of a prompt and constant communication between Englishmen in India and their native land. All furlouglh regulations should be revised, with the object of stimulating intercourse with Englandr,A impeding it. Officers serving in India should be no more divested of their national characteristic3 than officers serving elsewhere. Nor should they in any greater degree regard themselves as detached from their country. Service in India might easily be rendered popular when it was found to entail no disabilities, and to be productive of no estrangements. It would never do to garrison Bengal by a dominant force of Europeans, if those Europeans were to lie under the restrictions prevailing thirty years since. India requires, beyond doubt, for it administration special experience as well as general ability; we can never dispense with a school of statesmen mainly, if not exclusively, Indian as regards their information and their aptitudes; but these conditions do rot extend to the military departments of the Government. A good soldier is a soldier everywhere, in one place as well as another -,-in fact, we have just oommitted the pacification of India to an army which is touching ita shores for the fiS tiue; nor i% there any pro. bability that a regiment arriving there at this moment would be less efficient than one which may have been there these ten years. What is required in our officers is not Indian experience, but British character, and that is most likely to be austained by uninterrupted intercourse with the land which has originally conferred it.
General LroYD has come forward to defend himself against the charge of incompetency as shown in his management of things at Dinapore, but his defence rtuns oddly. " Although from my goutty "feet I am phajsieally iweqtua to active bodily " emlion, I assert that in judgment and inteUeet I " am fully equal, if not superior, to any of the " younger commanders at Dinapore." Yes, but what we have all along said is, that a General ought not only to have judgment and intelligence but also feet. It is different with some civil functionaries. There are great State officers who could dispense with feet altogether. A Lord Chancellor can deliver the most lucid judgments with his feet buried in mounds of flannel. He is a sedentary official, he need not be able to run, or ride, or walk, or even stand; if he can only sit it is quite enough; the only change he requires is a suecession of seats, which must, of course, be provided for him,-a seat in his library, a seat in his carriage, and a seat in the Court of Chancery. His footman lifts him from his ea y chair into his well-stuffed carriage, in which he rolls along till he comes to the next-not staton, but-sitting. The seat is, in fact, the badge of the Judge; it is what the coronet is to the Peer and the hat to the Cardinal; it is the emblem of imunoveable justiee; "]'Irnos sedet eternumq.e sedebit." But it is new to hear a General arguing as if he wera a judge of the Queen's Bench or Lord Chancellor, and could do without the proper use of his feet. We do not mean to lay it down positively that an earlier attempt to disarm the three naive regiments at Dinapore would have succeeded. General LLOYD says that they fled at the very first approach of the guns and European troops, and that this would have been exsactly the case whenever the attempt to disarm was made, whether later or earlier. He adds, that it was to prevent this dispersion that he put off the disarming, and commenced with the preliminary and lighter step of removing the stores of percussion caps. Well, there may or may not have been "judgment"-that is the General's claim--shown in this proceeding. But all this is befora the mutiny. How does the General act when the mutiny has broken out,-for this is the main test, after all, of his competency? A General should certainly be able to stir himself in such an emergency as this, and head the work of pursuit and punishment. But what is the cae here? General LLOYD tells us that he gave most judicious inAtructions for this purpose. " I gave instruc"tions for the attack and pursuit of the Sepoys "by the guns and HER MAJESTY'S 10th, under "their respective commanding officers, and left it " to them to follow tp the mutineers by land." But the gouty old General could only give instructions, and could not lead his troops. " I had no " horse in cantonments. My stable was two miles "distant, and, being unable at the time to walk "far or mueb, I thought I should be moss "useful on board tle steamer with guns and rifle- men." He expected to get some sbots at the Sepoys on the Arrah road, which ran along the bank of the river, " but the Sepoys, instead "of flying along the Arrab. road, went off across "the swampy fields," Fo that General LLOYD and bis steamer could not do much. Now, if this is not a picture of incompetency in an officer in military command we do not know what is. A mutiny brealks out, the mutineers fly, a pursuit takles place, but tne General, instead of joining his troops, is obliged to content himself, after giving instructions, with a position in a steamer on the river, and the mere chance of a flying shot at the rebels should they happen to take the road on the river's bank, which they do not-the General only knocking over a few of those who attempt to cross the river, in boats. We say this is a picture of incompetency. We do not say that it is culpable incowpetency. It is only justice to General L LOYD to admit that he does not appear to bave gone on board the steamer for any self-sparing object, but only because, as he says, he thought that with his bodily infirmities he would " be most useful "there." But, though we will not call it culpable incompetency, we must call it incompetency. The steamer was not the proper place for the commanding officer on that occasion, and a General was certainly ratber past his work who was obliged to take such means to " make himself useful." 'We do not find fault with General LLOYD so much as with the system which allowed a gouty old General to remain in command of an important post, where his infirmities would be certain to prevent him acting with any effect in any trying emergency. We have been oblUged in some remarks of ours cn this general. class of appointments to say things not very pleasant for old persons to hear, and which to some may have seemed not very respectf ul to old age. But we really cannot help ourselves. To old age in its place we are always ready to show proper respect, but nothing that is out of its place, and so far as it is out of its place, is woitby of respect. This is a valuable rule and a universal rule. Every person must be in his place if he means to claim respect as a right, and old age must be in its place. A Judge, a Bishop, and a Secretary of State may be oltl men, and may be afflicted with the gout, and st'll may be able to do their duties tolerably, but gouty antiquity is no more permitted to Generals than mediocrity is to poets. This is the conseqjuence, then, of our strict principle of succession by seniority, which aims so jealously at the preservation of the rights of age that it results in the exposure of its infirmitieQ. Why this extraordinary jealousy of younger men in our system of appointments ? Is it because seniority is the most convenient rtule, gives no trouble, and imposes no responsibility on the heads of department-? This has probably a good deal to do with it, but this is hardly a decent excuse for, and certainly not a satisfactory defence of, such appointments. But this is not, perhaps, the whoAe account of the matter. The beads of departments are generally themselves either old men, or at any rate approaching that tage, and old men like appointing their coevals. There is a latent compliment to themselves im- rlied in the choice. Nobody likes so adrmit that he is getting past work. An old head of a eepartment may not be able to deny the strokes of Time's clock, but he says to himself, " I feel myself as young as ever I was; my head is clear; I like business inore thLan " ever; I can sit for hours and hours at this table " with the greatest satisfaction ; the older I grow "the less I want to leave it; and business suits me " better and better every day." In this state of Eelf-cmigratulation the news of a vacant military appointment reaches our chief. Ile immediatoly says, "The very thing for my friend -; he has "jidgment, experience, and, as for age, o eli, he is of no age at all; why, he is "nly a year or two my senior, and t1erefore he " cannot be cld ; that is out of the question." Every one, says the Eastern proverb, has more than he thinks lhe has of four th'ngs-enenies, fau1lts, years, and debts, Wo grow older every dy, and do not feel any change in our inner nature and powers. And this may be to a certain extent true of the mind, but the body, unfortunately, cannot keep it up, and begins to lag. Timne tells on it, however that fiery courser intellect may escape the benumbing stroke. And here is the mistake of our head of a depart. ment. He tbinks that because he can sit at his table twelve hours a-day his old fricnd con remain on horseback as long-can ride, walk, and go about as actively as ever le did. With all the advantage that we derive from the age of our chiefs of departments in the way of experience, there is, perbaps, no little mischief attending this latent compliment to themsplves in the appointment of coevals.

ADELPHI THEATRZ. The engagement of Mx. T. P. Cooke having terminated on Saturday, the regular wInter season of the Adelphi com. nienced last night. According to immemorial custom It was inaugurated by the revival of Grecn Busht , and the reappearance of Medame Celeste, after an absence of several weeks, in tho character of Mimi. Tho house was attended by a numerous audience, and the directress, who has austained its fortunes for so many years, was received with every demonstration of bearty welcome. The speedy reappearance of Mr. B. Webs ter Is promised, and the an. nouncement of a romantic drama and a drama of "powerful interest" shows that the old Adelphi energies are alive in their wonted direction.
OLYMFPIC THEATRE. The revival last night of Mr. P&Igrave Simpson's amusing little plece, Heads or Tails (founded on the MTfon Etoile of X. Scribe), was rendered chiefly remarkable by the appearance of Ms Emden in the character of the comic maidservant. As Lis Somers this lady has long been a favourite actress at smaller establishments, but this was her first important attempt at a fashlonable theatre. Her manner is thoroughly natural, and is distinguished by that quaint uncon ioumness of which there has not been an instance since the days of Mr Humby, of whom her performance will doubtless remind many older playgoers.
CONCERTS FOR THE PEOPLE. The Monday Evening Concerts, " for the people," ara resumed, and the second performance took place last night in St. Martin's-halL There was a tolerably numerous audience, the nnajority of whomwerelocated in the area, tho charge for admission to which is 4d. The programme com priseda variety of pieces, exclusively vocal, chiefly by Englsh composers, in the Engllsh languaae, and therefore the more likely to be rationally enjoyed by the assembly to which they were addroesed. The pdncipaldngers were Misses Ellen Lyon, Cooper, E. Cooper, Messrs. Dawson, J. Howe, Lawler, and the members of the Marylebone Glee Society. Their exertions were unanimously appreciated; song after song was rewarded with the loudest applause, and several pieces were redemanded with great vehemenoe. That the entertainment afforded genuine gratification was evident. If the Monday Evening Concerts, through judicious management, can be made to pay on the " self-supporting' system, and to attract the class of people for whose benefit they were professedly established, their influence must nnquestionably be good. It is of oourse far better for the humbler classes to pass their leisure hours in listening to music, unaccompanied by the stimulants of tobacco and exciting beverages, than In other recreations needless to specify; ;but the difficnlty is to entice them. This task the committee of the Monday Evening Concerts have gallantly undertaken ; and it is to be hoped their benevolent iLtentions may be rewarded by ultimate success.

FIBE; Ar A PAPER MIL.L.-Early on Sunday .norning a fire broke out on the prem4ses of Messrs. Garnett and Sons, papsr manufacturers, Otley, Yorkshire, but it was fortunately extinguished by the efforts of the O.ley fire brigade, aided by a fire-engine belonging to Mr. IF. H. Fawkes, of Fainley-hall. An alarm of the coaflagration reached Leeds, and four engines started from that town, but when they had proceeded abont half way to Otley it was ascertained that the fire had been extinguibhed. Tho damage done is estimated at between 6001. and 7001., and It is covered by insurance in the Leeds and Yorkshire office.

IRBLAND. THE BANMS AND TRADE OF BYLFAST. (FBOX OUR OWN' COBxOND:NT.) DUBLIN. MONMAV fOnXrvn L1e 1 wmnercIa± reports from Belfast state that the general course of trade there exhibits little change from that noted last week. The Banner of Ulster remarks - " One very gratifying feature of o^,r local trade ig the punctual meeting of payments in all departments of trade, If a small business only cian be reported, that business is sound and legitimate. At the banhk all sotms quiet and easy, as though there were no storms in other atmospheres and no strandings of financial *hips in other waters. No extra pressure for accommodation can be noted at any of the local institutes of cash, and we rejoioe to report that so far Belfast hba escaped the suspension epidemle, In thosrmallertowns around us the good principle of comn mnercial integrity holds its usual influence over the republic of trade. A wholesome feeling of caution his been upheld by the merchants and traders of aU grades. In no caso ara weighty stocks on hand, and thus the incubus of large lots of merchandise hs not been suffered to press on the peoplo in business." Of the state of the linen trade the tame authority reports as follows6- " There has been no change in the ordinary aspect of tbla manufacture for the week. In the present state of affairs beyond the Atlantic activity could not be expected, nor has the home trade been marked by the usual stir of the autumn season. Stocks accumulate largely in several of the more extensive houses. Sanguine merchants feel ahope that the panic is nearly over, Rnd that the feverish con. dition of finance in the Northern States will speedily abAte. In the meantime the usual activity prevails at our seats of finish, and the spread-grounds of bleachfields are very widely oovered with goods in process of whitening. Browrn markets were largely supplied with webs for the last 10 days. Ballymena, the loading place of public sale, wras dull on Saturday, and large quantities of goods were held over. Prioes, however, did not recede. Armagb, on Tuesday, was quiet, and Lurgan, on Thurnday, equally inactive. Power. loom goods begin to bulk largely. Yarns show no turn Sales have been inactive, and for low wefte less money has been accepted. The general rule of the market, however, is firmness, Flax has been taken pretty freely, and, in the face of adverse reports about finished goods and dull transactions in yarns, the raw material holds a finm placo a, to prices." Referring to the commercial embarrassments across the Channel the trade report of the Belfast MIercury says:- " Looking to local affairs, it is satiEfactory to state that while in the manufacturing districts across the Channel the building of flax-spinning factories has gone on at a rapid pace, hero, in Belfast, we have not increased production of linen yarns in any perceptible degree; for, while some small mills rere built, other large ones were susFended, and stocks, which had accumulated to some considerable extent a few years ago, are new narrowed down to a ver low amount. It is also satiefactory that none of our merchan ts are connected with the Borough Bank of Liver. pool or the Western Bank of Scotland. It wotuld be wrong to say that no loss will be sustained here by the suspen sion of these two banks; it winl be a loss to the opera. tire community that a great deal of money from Scotch employers, annually expended in Ireland, will be withdrawn, but the comm ercial body generally will not suffer much, though a few individuals may be involved to a small extent." THE RUN FOR GOLD. One of the Galway papers (the Tuam Hcrall) states that during the last few days a great many holders of National Bank notes have applied for gold at the bank in that town. "The bank (it is added) is meeting every demand1iF gold, which It seems to hold in abundance. We knot not the orlgin of this run, but we know it is the opinion of lr the intelligent men in the community that the panic, which is almost altogether confined to the peasantry, is totallry unfounded. It was at the fair at Kilmain, on Wednesday, that the matter was first spoken of." One of the Dublin trade reports states that the bills of the Liverpool Borough Bank are held to some exient here, but not the slightest apprehension is entertained as to there being any danger of loss ia the matter. It 'was the custoni of several of the cattle-dealers who frequent Smithfield-market here to exchange the money they received in England in payment of their stock for twro months' biUs of the Borough Bank, upon which they Fwere allowed the discount by the bank, but hich rwere taken here by the salesmasters as cash. STATE OF TIPPFRARY. Since the murder of Mr. John Ellis there appears to be an attempt to revive the old code of Ribandism inl the North Riding of Tipperary. The local paper of Saturday (the .Tenagh Guardian,) reports the following latest outrage in that district:- " A party of men visited the dwelling of John Hackett, who resides on the townlan d of BaUycormack, near Holycross, on the night of the 28th inst., and fired a shot through the window of the kitchen. Hackett, his wife, and a neighbonring man named Reilly were sitting before the fire at the time, and they had a most providential escape, as some of the contents of the gnn (broken nails) feU near them, having pierced through the shutter, which was fortunately closed at the time. Hackett is caretaker over lands purchased by Mr. Matthew R. Gabbett, of Dublin, some six years ago In the Encumbered Estates Court When Mr. Gabbett came into possession of this property he purchased on liberal terms the goodwill of several small co ttiers, -who gave np their claims with apparent satisfaction, if not thankfulnesa, and up to the ontrage we hxve recorded there had not been the slightest manifestation of hostility either tow rres theresoected gentleman himself (who is spoken of very highly by the peasantry), or his caretaker, a quiet and inoffensive man. It would appear, however, that the late murder of the unfortunate Mr. Elis has given a fresh impetus to Ribandism in our county, and, favoured hy the 'long, dak; nights,' ominous Words in Tip. perary forrnerly,emboldened its upholders in the commission o£ their nocturnal offences."
SUSPECrED POISOiNUG OF A EGSBAND, WrF', AzD CB ILD.-At 2 o'clock, on the morning of Friday, tbe neighbourhood of the church of Bilboe, about seven miles from Carlow, was in a state of much excitement, occasioned by the rumour that a man narned Turnsted, his wife, and child, were poisoned. A messenger was despatched at once for Dr. Anderson, of Tiscoffin, the nearest medical an, wvho at once proceeded to the person in question, and on his arrival he found Mrs. Turnsted in a state of collapse, her husband labouring under violent action of the stomach and bowels, attended with violent pains, and the child asleep, appareuntly after having suffered in a ,imilar way. Dr. Anderson at once proceeded to administer the necessary antidotei and restoratives, but had little hope of being able to save blrs. Tmrnsted's life. The husband is still in a precarious state, but the child appears to be convalescent. There are strong suspicions of arsenioal poisoning, and that the poison bas been vilrully admin. istered by aother person.-Kilken7Y Journal. Smt (GXoRoGE G-.W AT MOItPEM.-On Wednesday last the Secretary of State for the Homae Department, who has a country residence at Falloden, about 20 miles from MIorpoth, paid a visit to his constituents and took part in the proceedings at a public meeting held At Bedlington, an oUtLying part of the borougb, to promot the rebuilding of a school, vwith the aid of a grant of money from the Governaent. The Rev. CharleA Whitloy, the vicar, who has generously given a site for the proposed seminary, acted as chairman, aDd the nmeeting was atte.ided by the principal inhabitants. Sir George Grey, in moving a resolutioa stating the inndeqnacy of the present sehool aooommodattor for an increasing populatson, and the expediency of aug. menting it by a Government grant in aid of private sub. scriptions, took occasion to say he considered it the bounden duty of those who had property in the district or political connexions with it to assist in keeping up the means of education to the number ald wants of tho inbabitants, The timo had gono by when it was necessary to dilate on the advanta;,ss of education, or to point it out ae a duty we owed to God and our neighbour. Unfortunately, a divLson of opinion had long existed as to how education could be best promoted. Continenul methods of educatiort wouXi never be popular in England.

THE INDIAN MUTINY. THE FUTTERGETTR Am,.rTr-vx The following account of the Futtebghur mutiny 'avas drawn up by one of the survivors. It is dated Vawnpore, September 13:- On the 3d of Juno information vwas received at Fattehthur, that the troops at Shabjehanpore and Bareilly had mutinied, and that a body of the Oude mutineers, consisting tf an infantry and cavalry corps,were marching Into Futtehthur. This caused great anxiety, as the 10th were knowvn to be mutinously disposed, for they had glvon out that as soon as another corps arrived they would rise and murder zll the Europeans, only sparing their own officers. That tight a consultation was beld, and it was considered abso Iutely necessary to send off the ladies and children to Cawnpore, and aa boats had been secured it was settled that a start should be made at once, as it had been before agreed that it was impossible to hold the fort, and it was at that time thought that the river was quite open. All was settled, -when several gentlemen said that unless the magistrute accompanied them they would not leave the station, He agreed to go; accordingly the party started at 1 a.m. on the 4th, and got on very well that night. The next morning we were joined by Eome of the officers of the 10th, who reported that the 10th had mutinied, seized the treasure, abused the Colonel, and fired on one or two of their officers, and that there was little chance of any *of those who had remained behind having escaped. We accordingly proceeded on otr way, and when opposite the village Koosoomkhow were fired upon by the villagers, but only one of our party was slightly wounded. T'he next day we had not gone far when a report reached us that the Onde troops were crossing one of the giAts a few miles below. The boats were anchored tiU Information could be received from the man at the ferry ; wvhen he came up he said it was false, so a consultation was held to know what was best to be done, and as the party vwas very large it was agreed that it would be safer to divide. Eurdeobulu,h having offered Mr. Probyn protection, with any of his friends, it was settled to go to his fort, About 40 Europeans availed themselves of the protection offered. The remainder of the party proceeded to Cawnpore, as no Intelligence of the mutiny there had reached us ; and I may here anticipate the narrative by stating that the whole of the party, amounting to about 126 souls, who went down ithe river were foully murdered by the Nena Sahib at Clawnpore. Arriving within a few miles of Dhurrumpore [about 10 mrles from Futtehghur) we learnt that the Colonel had induced the 10th to return to their duty; that though they had the treasure in their ponsession, aU was going on much as usual. Accordingly Mr. Probyn and two officers rode into Futtehghur to ascertain the state of affairs After remaining two days Mr. Probyn returned to Dhurrumpore, where he and his family, with Mr. W. Edwards, colieetor of B4daon, eventually remained under the protection of Herdeobuksh. After remaining a few days, and being convinced that the Gurhee of Dhurrampore was not in a position which could afford any effectual protection against any armed force, It 'was determined to return to the station on the 13th of June, and we commenced sleeping at the fort and returning to our duties. Each morning preparations were made to secure boats and have them ready for flight, in case the regiment again mutinied. Early on the morning of the 18th of June vie were sud. tienly roused by one of the officers(Lieutenant Swettenham) vho informed us that the regiment was in open mutiny, the Sepoys havlng broken the gaol and released the prisoners. Thisevent tookusby surprise, for a couple of days previously the 10th had handed to their commanding officer, Colonel .9mith, a letter written by the Subahdar of the 41st, who had come from Seetapore, tid Shabjehanpore, and were there a few miles distant across the river, requesting the 10th to murder aU their officers as they had done theirs, seize the treasure, and join them. The Subadar informed the Colonel that they had said in reply that they had served the Company Bahadoor too many years to turn traitors, and that they were determined to abido faithful to their Salt, and advised the 41st not to come in their way, as they 'would certainly oppose them. The Sepoys had also assisted their officers in breaking up the bridge of boats and siakLag al other boats at the different ghftts, to prevent in every 'way possible the mutineers crossing to the Futtehghur side. All this, however, was merely to serve as a blind, for no sooner did the 41st cross and enter the city walls than a company oi the 10th and the artillerymen, with the two guns, stationed on the parade guarding the treasure narched to the Nawab, placed him on the Guddee, and 3aid the colours at his feet, and fired a Royal salute of 21 guns. From all accounts the Nawab declined to accept of their colours, but said if they brought him the treasure he would have no objection to receive them into his service. The Sepoys, however, were not to be done out of their money, so returned to the parade ground, saluted their colours, and shared the money among themselves. Up to this time a few had remained with us as a guard in the Tort; these now took their departure quietly; one or two zeturned now and again to fetch away their lotas and other orticles they had left in the fort. The reglment then divided into two parties. The Purbees crossed over at once to Oude, with intention to make for their homes, accompanied by Captain Bignall-we afterwards learnt that this body had been plu,dered by the villagers and Captain Big. 3sall killed; otbers went off by twos and threes to their homes, and those who remained were killed by the 41st be. cause they were not allowed a share in the public money. Thus this regiment was completely disorganized and des. troyed. It was now suggested by some to take to the boats, but the river was mach too low, so that idea was abandon-d, and it was resolved to hold the fort. Out of upwards of 100 Europeans, including women and children, there were buat 33 ablebodied men, and these proved our sole avaiable force for defence. We then endeavoured to prepare against any attack. A 6-pounder loaded with grape was mounted over the gateway, and about 300 muskets, stored in the fort, were brought out, loaded, and placed ready for imme. diate use. While Mr. Thorohill was loading his It aocidentally went off and wounded him severely in the hand and arm, incapacitating him from further duty. The godowns were next searched for ammunition for the guns and muskets, but only a few muster round shot and shells were found, together with sixboxes of ballcartridgeand an equal quantity of blank. 3 he latter we broke up and used ilor the guns, and a lot of nuts, screws, hammer heads, &c., -were collected to serve as grape and round. We were then mustered and divided into three parties, each under the orders of a military offlcer, and the whole under the com. mand of Colonel Smith, of the 10th. Our first day passed very quietly, but we heard that the 41st were encamped on Lackparah, a large tope about a mile to the west of the fort, and were making preparations to attack us. At nightfall pickets were posted at each bastion, but the night passed without any attac_. In the morning we mounted a 3 pounder, and by the evening a -9-pouuder was brought into position. Provisions were also stored, and we busied ourselves in strengthening our posi. tion aS much as possible, and by the time the 41st attacked 3ss we had seven guns mounted-viz., 3-pounder, 6-pounder, 9-pounder, 12-pounder, 18-pounder, and a 24-pounder; the last three being howitzers, and a small brass mortar. On the evening of the 26th or 27th of June a party of our coolles, who were employed in pulling down some walls close to the fort, were fired upon by the enemy. An alarm 'was immediately sounded, which brought every man to his post; few shots were exchanged, but nothing particular *ccurred. Next morning before daybreak the mutineers opened upon us 'with their two guns, but it was too dark for them to aim with any certainty, so after a few rounds they stopped and recommenced firing at daylight. The Sepoys tock up their positions behind trees, bushes, and anything which afforded them cover, and kept up a heavy musketry fire aud gave us little or no chance for a shot at thern. Their fire, heavy though it was, did us no harm; they maizitained it tUl a Uttle past noon, when most of -hem began to retire, and by the evening only some random shots were heard now and again. Next morning the guns began to play again, but from a different directlon, still doing no harm, as the shots either a-assed over or hit the bastions. The discharge of musketry -was heavier this morning than on the preceding. Several ladders were seen being borne towards the fort, but the l5earers were shot down by us as soon as they came within r ange. For four days the enemy's guns and muskets played on in this manner, and seve?al ineffectual attempts wexe made to escalade. On the fifth day a decided decrease of firing vas observed; a company of the riflemen had taken up their positions on the tops of houses in the Hoosainpore viUage, and kept up a deadly fire upoa us, Captain Phil. lamore, Mr. Sutherland, and one or two of the servants were thus wounded. Some of the riflemen had also taken zp their po,itions In a small outhouse about 70 or S0 lards from the fort. They loopholed the walls and kept up a harassing fire from thoem, which rendered vr, guns perfectly useless, as we dared not lift tour heads to fire. It was here my poor brother, *-while c'overing one of the guennrs (Conductor Ahern) -with his rifle, was mortally wounded by a bail in 4hohead, which killed him a few hours after. Colonel 'Xacker was killed on the same spot a day after my brother -was wounded, and they were buried together in one grave. 4t)n the following morning Mr. Ahern blew away, with a isocharge of grape, some dozen men who were constructdng a breastwork for their riflemen on the woodyard wall,which Vllace they had reached by means of a covered way they had erected with jhow and sandbags under the protection of the Sxe of their riflemen, They did not attempt the same again, but procured the assistance of some Sappers and Miner3 and cut a hole throuogh the woodyard wall, and by this means got into the yard. There was a large store of firewood and straw in it, so we allowed thom to get in, and work away, for they rere unable to do us any hsrm, and when they had fairly worked for two days we fired tho wood and drove them out baffled. They commenced a inine and worked two nights, and early on the third morning they sprun-, i;; the explosion was awful, it shookthe whole fort, we allI tbought it was over with us, but an examination proved that it had blown down only five or six yards of the wall, leaving the inner half standing. The bastion where I was happened to be the next to that where the explosion took place; I at once ran to the spot to :ee what mischief was done; seeing, however, several of our gatty voigaed(l in moving a gun to the breach, I returned to my own post, and noticed from 100 to 100 P'athans and Sepoys congregating below the breach, in order to attempt an ecalade, as soon as the dust and smoke cleared off. I at once sent notice to the others to get aid, and in the meantime by pouring the fire of two double barrels and eight muskets, already loaded, into thenm, and discharging themn as they were reloaded by a native, managed to disperse thenu before any of my comrades came up to my aid. Somewhat later in the day a second assault was attempted, which was defeated by Mr. Fisher's shooting the leader of the narty, which caused his followers to fall back. We this .lay lost our best gunner, Mr. Ahern, who was shot through .he bead while layinig a gun. The eneemy had now brought a gun to bear upon the bungalow contaisiirg the ladies and children. The shots generally passed over, but two or three struck the home ; another gain they got to bear against the gate, and contrived to break a hinge and knocked several holes throngh it, but little harm was done, as we had piled up the archway with timber, which effectually stopped tFe sbots. Two of our guns -were soon after disabled. The onemy then commenced another mine close to the first. The dethrmination thus shown by them, as also ths lors of three of our h st men, disheartened the garrison, already worn out by fatibue and watching. It was also certain that if the second nilne was completed and fired, the enemy would attaok us by both breaches, which we could not pnsa'ibly dfsend ; our position became desperate ; we began to look to thle boats as our only node of escape, the river having risen considerably by the rains. After due consideration it was determined to evacuate the fort. No time was lust in getting everything ready for a start. The laeies and children weredividedlntothreeparties. Atmid night they were got safely Into their respective boats ; one of the- party was then sent round to the pickets to call them in Atal,out2 asn. of the 4thof July webadallembarked. The gans in the fort had been spiked, and the little ammunition we had left destroy ed. The order was given to let go; we Atarted in very good order, but no sooner did we pass the fort walls than showers of bullets were sent after us, and a cry raised that the Feringhees were running away. The i,epoys followed us about a nmile, firing all along, but doing uo harmn, for we were a long way out of range. WVe had not proceeded far when it was found that Colonel (loldie's boat was much too large and heavy for us to manage. It was accordingly determined to be abandoned, so all the ladies and children were taken on Colonel Smith's boat. A little delay was thus caused, which the Sepoys took advantage of to bring a gun to bear on the boats; the dis. taice, however, was too great; every ball fell zhort. As soon as the ladies and children were all safely on boand we started and got down as far as Singheerampore without accident, although fired upon by the villagers. Eere we stopped a few minutes to repair the rudder of Colonel Smith's boat, and one oat of two boatman we had was killed by a matchlock ball. The radder repaired, we started again, Colonel Smith's boat taking the lead. We had not gone beyond a few yards when our boat grounded on a soft muddy sandbank; the other boat passed on, all hands got into the water to push her; but, notwithstanding all our eff>rts, we could not manage to move her. M'e had not bhen in this unhappy position half an hour when two boats, apparently empty, were seen coming down the stream. They samo within 20 yards of us, when we dtseovered that they carried Sepoys, who opened a heavy fire, killing and wound. ing several. Mr. Churcher, son., was shotthrough the chest; Mr. Fisher, who was just behind me, was wounded in the thigh. Ilearing hiin caU out, I had scarcely time to tu'n round when I felt a sumart blow on my right shoulder; a bullet had grazed the k-in and taken off a Little flesh. Major Robertson was wounded In the face. The hoats were now alongside of us. Some of the Sepoys had already got into onr boat. Major Robestson, seeing no hope, begged the ladieei to come into the water rather than to fall into their hands. Wbile the ladies were throwngn themselves into the water I jiumped into the boat, took up a loaed oc .sket, and, going astern, Ehot a Sepoy. I loaded agiin, b;xt finding no cap I was obliged to retreat, as the enemy wvre now coming in in great numbers. Lieutenant and Mrs. Fif zgerald were at this time sitting In a corner of the boat with their child. Lieutenant Fitzgerald had a loaded miuket, vith the bayonet fixed, In his hand. Ir. Churcher, sen., still lay weltering in his blocd. The others had all got out of the boat into the water, Mafjor and Mrs. Robertson, with their chUd and Miss Thompson, were standing close to each other beside the boat; Lteutenant Simpson and Mr. Churcher, jun., were near them also; I all this time lost sight of Major PhilUot, Ensign Eckford, and a few others. I suppose they were killed. Mr. and Mrs. isaer we.e about 20 yards from the boat; he had his child in his arin apparently lifeless. Mrs. Fisher could not stand against the current ; her dress, which acted like a sai'. knocked her down when sbe was helped up by Mr. Fisher. I now resolved to make an escape, If possible, to the leading boat, which I knew could not have proceeded far, so at cnce I btruck out into the stream. Mr. and Mlrs. Fishcr eon. tinued in a distressing position when I passed them unable to render any assistance. I saw Mr. Fisher again, alone, floating on his back, but soon lost sight of lmn, as it was getting dark. I contirnued swimming for about an hour or niore, vwhen at some distanme I saw the other boat. On reaching her I found everything .n confusion; hlr. Rohan, the youngest Mis Goldie, a chiid, and tl:e only manjee wl-o was on board were killed; Lieutenant Swettenbam, Dr. Mailtby, and one or two were severely wounded opposite Singheerampore by heavy fire I of grape froma two guns planted on the heights by the Sepoys who had followed us. We repaired the rudder, which had been damaged, and continued our voyago with heavy hearts all that night. Early the next morn*ng a voice hailed us from the shore, which we recognized as Mr. Fisher's. He came on board and informed us that his poor wife and chUd had been drowned in his arimis; his wound was very painful, the ball having passed through the middle of tho left thigh. We continued our voyage the whole of that day 'till we reached a village opposite Koosoomkhore, in the Oude territcries. Here the villagers offered us assistance and protection. We at firs' feared treachery, but soon, convinced that they were friends, accepted their kind offers and put to shore for i the night. We were aU hungry, and begged the villagers to bring us some food, which they soon did, givinig us chu. 1 patties and buffalo's milk, which groetly refreshed us, My wound had now become very painful, and my naked back having been expoEed to the sun and rain all day was smarting severely. The boat, now, as I supposed, was anchored for the nlght. 1 determined to find rest in the village, as I had had none the two previous: ihts. I asked one of the thackoors if he could accommodate me wvith a charpoy for the night in his village. He at once took me , with him, and gave ine plenty to eat and a charpoy. By this time my back hbd become so very sore that I could find no ease In arny position. At night a meesage caine from Cclonel Smith, saying the boat was going to leave. I was too weak, however, to pay any attention to It, A second and third came, but I woould no go. 1 had determined to stand my chance, happen what might. Tho boat left. I beard nothing more of it for several days, till their mangee who took her down returned and gave out that Nena Sabib had tired upon them at Bithoor, and aU on board were killed. I reimained in the village for about a m'ant:s, and subseouently joined Mr. Probyn, and camne down with hirn to Cawnpore.

"Ia my last I tlink I told you of the arrival of the moveable column from Kamptee-viz., four 9-pounders, two 241b. howitzers, 70 artilerymen (Europeans), a squadron of the 4th Light Cavalry, the rifle company of the 1st Nagpore Infantry, and the 33d regiment of Madras Native Infantry, the whole under Colonel Millar. Two companies of the 52d Bengal Native Infantry and two companies of our 23th joined the column here. Wel, wo in our simplicity thought the colamn had been sent here for our benefit; but on the 19th of last month the entire column moved on tow-ards Dumoh, not leaving us a single man or gun. We did get up a meeting of the senior officers. All of as who were to remain here advocated the necessity of leaving us X couple of guns, but all who were going with the column were against dividing it, and, as they were the more numerous, of course they had it all their own way. Major -, however, wrote to Government, pointing out our position and what a loss it would be to Government, and that the labour of 30 years in securing the Thuggs might be thrown away in a moment. We believe thi s representation bore fruit eventually, bat for a long time we were left to our own resources. After the arrival of the Kamptee column aU the married men, except myself, left the intrenolimeuta at the Residency and returned to their bungalows. I was quite sure there would, sooner or later, be a panic, and that they would all rush back to the Residency. Well, affirs went on smoothly enough for a time, and on the 31st of August, the last day of the Mohurrum, I was in 'the act of writing that al had pass d ofl quietly, when B- ran in and said Mrs. So and So, naming two or three ladies, were all come. tiura enough here was the panic I anticipated. There they were, pale and agitated. An immediate attack of Bundelahs, aided by the Budmashes from the city, was apprehended, and some of the 52d were said to be implicated. It was not a false alarm, thou -b, tbank God, nothing came of it. A large body of Bundelahs had assembled on the low hills beyond the parade ground. They were to have attacked us at early dawn, hoping to carry the 52d with them as they cosssed the parade. The non-appearanjee of an influential chief, who had promised to join with 400 men, frustrated the plan; Ihis ef course was ascertained aiterwards. From that time to this all tbe ladies have remained at the Resldency. For a few days all was quiet. Suddenly we were startled by seceiving an express forn young Osborne at Rewab, informnug ws that Koor Singh, with 4,000 men, had ascended the Ghauts and was advancing on Rewah; that the Rajah had advied him to lave the country, as he could not protectim, and his troops could not he depended upon. The Rajah himself dled to a stronghold he has in the southern part o' his territory. One blaguard fired at Osborne, but he de. termnined not to leave the country till the last moment. The next express from Osborne reheved our minds from any apprehension of an attack on us by Koor Singh. The rural populalion of Rowah -refused to sanction the pzssage of Koor Sir.gh and hls mnen through the Rewah territory; and though he offered a guararntee that no property would be injinred, and said he would pay for everything, they would not listen to hin. Hle was not strong enough to force a passage, but as he and the Rewah Rajah are connected by marriage I fancy he never Intended to employ force, so he retired down the Ghauts. It is said that the people told Eoor Singh if he could show a ' perwannah' from the King of Delhi they would allow him to pass. Luckily for us he was not provided with such a document. About this time, also, reports reached uas that the Dinapore mutineers, joined by the Ramghur battalion and sx guns, amounting to some i,G0 nmen in all, had, when In the act of crossing the .jun,na, suddenly changed their minds, and were In full march on Banda. A glance at the map will show how this was likely to affect us. Whether from these reports or by an order from Calcutta (this last I believe is the fact, though .,,e havoenot been told so), we were gladdened on Sunday evening, the 13th, by the arrival of 2 guns and20 European arlilleryceon, GO troopers of the 4th Light Cavalry, and 150 Sepoys of the 33d Madras Native infantry, sent back to our assistance from the Kamptee column. The arrival of thls worec g:ve us confidence, and the very next morning our Deputy-Coiurmisaloner (Clerk, of the 4th Light Cavalry) scized 12 men who were known to be conspiring against our Government; at the head of the conspiracy was Sunker Shah, the Gond Rajah, and his son. Their place of abode is about four miles from this. In former days this family ruled over all this part ot the country; they can trace their descent for 60 generations. The family had been deprived of everything by the Mah. rattas, and were in great poverty when we took possession. Our Government raised them up from this state, and gave them sufficient to support themselves comfortably, and now they showeed their gratitude by conspiring against us ia our time of sore triaL The family have neither much property nor power, but the ancient name and prestige was apoint on which to rally. About 9 o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, the 15th, a report was recoived that there would be an attempt made to rescue the 12 prisoners; immediate precautions were taken to preventisuch an event. The 52d Regiment were 3aid to be implicated. Most of us were under arms all niight; about 3 o'clock in the morning several shots wers heard, fired near the lines of the 5 2d, and in a short time dames were observed to issne from an unocoupied officee's bungalow near the llnes-this was all that ocourred. In the morning it was aseertained that eight men of the 52d had gone off with their arms and ammunition, 40 rounds per man. You will naturally ask, ' How could they got their arms and such a quantity of ammunition? It happens thus -when we first came to live in tho Residency, the men of 'he 52d were allowed to take their arms and keep them in their own houses, and every man had 40 rounds of ball cartridge served out to him, and this they were allowed t) retain to the last. On the 16th and 17th all remained quiet; on the 18th, at 11 o'clock a.m., our two guns were advanced a few hundred yards in front of the Residency, covered by a company of the 33d and a few troopers, and it became known that the Gond Rajah and bis son were about to he blown away from the cannon's month. The old man walked up to the guns with a firm stride, the son appeared more dejected; the old man, with his snow-white hair and firm mcanner, almost excited compassion, and one had to remember, before such feelings could be checked, how atrociously he iDtended to deal with us had his conspiraoy suo ceeded; the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming, all was over in a few minutes. I he scattered remainswere pounced upon by kites and vultures, but what could be collected was handed over to the Ranee. In the course of the day Colonel Janieson went to the lines of his regiment, intending- to take away 300 spare muskets (those belonging to the men on leave), hat the men al appeared so quiet and made such professions of fidelity that the Colonel was convinced of their staschness and good faith, and did not carry his inten. tions into efiect. But I ought to add that he was partly in. duced to leave matters as they were for the sake of some of his officers wbo were on detached duty. At the very time t'e men were assuring the Colonel of their fidelity they were on the eve of open mutiny. At 9 o'clock that night the whole of the regimnent left the cantonment, and so quietly did they go that it was some time before it was known that they had aotually slipped away. They took with them the colours of the regiment, their arms, and the 40 rounds of ammunition; they took lsho about 4,000 rupees from the regimental cash chest. They abandoned all the property they had in their lines. The guards over the treasury and magazine quietly withdrew, leaving both untouched. In the course of the night we secured both the treasure (140,000 rupees) and the contents of the magazine, sudalso the MtO spare usuekets. On the forenoon of the 19th the mutineers reacbed a place called Patun, 20 miles off, where there was a detachment of the regiment under a European officer; this officer they placed in confinement, and have written to say they will not give him up unless we give up the ten men of the regiment who remained behind. A de. tachment of 40 men under a native officer, stationed 12 moiles froq.p Yatvun, muutinied and joined the others, but alo lowed thenative officer to come here. Another detachment, with two European officers, was stationed 40 miles from this, on the Mir7apore road. When news of the defection of the whole regiment reached this detachment, the native officer told the two European offioers that they had better g I away. They ordered their horses and walked quietly ofl; their horses led behind them, and their servants carrying their guns. A number of tho Scpoys went along with them for a time, some of them crying like children; and at parting the native officer shook hands with them I We were delighted when we saw them safe here on Sunday (20th) night. Is It not a complete marvel this mutiny? There seems to be an understanding that when a regiment is called upon to go-go it must. The moving cause in this instance we have not far to look for; but, to finish the 52d, I may here add that the two companies, with the Kamptee column, were quietly disarmed and the column is now on its return to Jubbulpore. I cannot but think that it was a false move the column ever leaving this. They have destroyed a village or two, and perhaps the lesson might have had a salutary effect had the column remained or gone on, but this return will, I fancy, leave matters much as they were, if not worse. Damoh was saved, and 80,000 rupees, which might havo been done by a detachment. And now to return to the Dinapore mutineers. The next news wo heard of them was that they had left Banuda, and were advancing on Nagode. The officer commanding the 50th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, stationed there, calculating on the stanchness of his men, made every preparation for an orderly retreat; the men alilowed the magazine to be destroyed, and the officers spiked the first two guns and smashed 400 spare muskets. When the Dinapore rebels were within three miles of the cantonment (this was on the 16th), the 50th crossed the river, and had marched awAy for some distance, when a man in the leading company suddenly called out 'Halt r The order was instantly obeyed, and the men prepared to fire upon their officers. The officers, seeing at once that flight alone could save them, rode off. We have since heard that all the officers, with 120 good men of the regiment, have crossed the Sousa, and are making the best of their way to Mlrzapore. Now, I have no doubt but that it was a quite a settled affair between the 50th and 52d that both regiments were to go; the exact day depended on circunmstances; and yet you see how both regiments kept up appearances to the last moment. * "The mutineers, we hear, are still at Nagode. There vas 70,000 rupees in the treasury there, which I suppose they have got. In our entenecments we had not much to fear from the 52d, but we are all very thankful that they went off so quietly, for they might have destroyed much property. Saugor is still safe. I am happy to say young Gordon and all the Jubhulpore party arrived there a few days ago; the Shawghur Rajah had allowed them to go. They had been treated very shabbily by their different captors, but I have not heard particulars. At hlow they are in a regular fix; the Bombay regiments sent for its relief have shown such a mutinous spirit t.he column cannot move. I fear much that more of the Bombay regliments will go, but I trust' the hiadras army ill continue faithfuL. It is much to be lamnented that a few thousand men werer not at once sent overlnd-5,000 a month ago would have been of more valuo than 50,000 now. You see I have confined myself to writing about our own province; all other details and later news you will find In the pa rs."
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your article on Wednesday on the extension of mutiny through the ranks of the Bombay army ought to convince the Government that we can no longer trust our dominions in the East to any army composed of the subject race. When the appalling news of the revolt of the Bengal Native Army first fell upon the ear of this country we had nearly every reason offered for its occurrence save the right one. The Bombay army was pointed to especially as an example of what could be accomplished by superior discipline. The Bengal officer was charged-and even by men who were themselves soldiers-with laxity of discipline and with per. sonal conduct towards the men calculated to produce dis. affection, if not the very calamities which had occurred. And this grievous charge was brought against them at a time when they required and deserved all the sympathies of their brethren. *They were blamed for the class of men of which the regiments were composed,-it was all oving to the number of Brahmlns and Rajpoots enlisted; they ought to have had more low caste men, more Mahomedans, &k. Then they had petted and pampered their men and succumbed to tbeir prejudices. This, however true of the Indian Govern. ment, is utterly untrue of the officers of regiments, and they must know little of the British officer who suppose that he is ever likely to put up with any nonsense from the men under him. Again was the Bombay army paraded triumphantly before the unfortunate Bengal officers while wounded in the most tender point by the base treachery and bratal conduct of the men In whom they had placed the most un. bounded confidence. They were down, and some men had the baseness to tresd upon them, instead of simply passing by on the other side if they would not help them. It wwas all the Bengal system. Look how different It was at Madras and Bombay. But the truth has now come to light, and that truth has proved past aU denial that we can no longer place confidence In the regiments of either Bombay or Bengal when com. posed of our Indian subjects, however mixed the race and however low the caste. To borrow your most admirable ilustration, they are gun. powder stilL It matters not of what quality the charcoal may be, once add the sulphur and saltpetre, in the shape of arms ans ammunition, and it becomes explosive and dangerous. As long as the charcoal continues in its normal condition, although combustible, it is not dangerous. And as long as the Hindoo and Mahomedan continue in the position of mere tillers of the ground and manufacturers of commodities, they are not only innoxious but useful and valuable. But once arm and discipline these same men and they become a most dangerous manufacture. Many people have supposed that by mixing up men of various races in the formation of our native army we might deprive it of all explosive properties and render it a trust. worthy engine. But depend upon it, whatever the quality of the charcoal it is charcoal still An inferior quality may render the gunpowder made from it less effectual against our enemies, but it is an art:cle as dangerously explosive againstonrselves as though the principal engredients were of the best quality. I am very hopeful that the fall of the great stronghold of the revolt will strike terror into the hearts of the disaffected and thus check the progress of contagion in the Bombay army. But, as you truly observe, enough has already occurred to dispel the delusion that you can constitute an army from the subject race that wiiU prove faithful to their conquerors at all times and prefer their service to being their own masters, even when they suppose the choice is open to them. The wreck of the Bengal army is now complete; the last stick left standing has gone overboard in the apostacy of the 50th and 52d Regiments. The work of reconstruction has therefore to be begun de sieve. In commencing upon it, the first thing to be ascertained is our absolute wants in the way of foreign levies. Before a single man is enlisted let the duties for which he is entertained be fully ascertained, and whatever levies may be required to carry on the police duties of the country-and we require them for no otherlet us use no more charcoal in their composition if we would avoid a repetition of the terrible tragedy jus't played out in India. Whatever may be required to carry on duties unsitable to the European soldier in that country must henoeforth be composed of alien races. Ohoorkas, Affghans, Punjabees, Malays, Burmese, Caffres, Zooloos, may all be used and wil answer the purpose very welL But no native materiaL if we value our future peace. To raise regiment upon regiment without inquiring for what object, and becauso we had a certain number of regiments before, would b- a most unwise way of proceeding. What are they to do? where are they to go? are questions to be answered before organizing a single levy. Surely we shall never call forth a mighty army merely to supply guard at the quarters of every staff officer and civil official in a cantonment, and over every petty commissariat godown the contents of which may not be worth the pay of a choke. dar, or capable of being carried off were any one desirous of stealing them? Let strict inquiry be made into the nature of the duties taken in cantonments by our native troops, and X think we shaU find that there was very nmuch that was most superfluous, if not really objectionable ; and that onefourth the strength of the late Bengal army will amply suffice for all necessary purposes, while the European army hitherto maintained in ldia will be sufficieut to preserve the most perfect peace and order tbroughout our vast empire.

GENVEBRL WILSON OF DELHI. TO TEB EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It appears that the victorious Geleral VilEon, now in possession of the bloodstained stronghold of the execrable mutineers in Central India, is supposed by many from his coolness aud determination to bo a native of Scotland. Now, without detracting one iota from the acknowledged bravery of our Scottish fellow-subjects, I venture, through the medium of your well-known journal, to inform such of your readers as may feel interested in the matttr that General Wilson is not only an Englishman, but a native of Norfolk, cousin of the present Lord Berners, educated at the Norwich Grammar School, and a fellow-s:udent of the gallant Sir James Brooko, Rajah of Sarawak. Norfolk has produced in a pre-eminent degree men gfamed for deeds of arms," from the immortal hero Nelson down to Windham of the Redan and Wilson of De ; and as such England heis just cause to be proud of ker eastern county, aud that county ot her gaUant sons.

THE INDLAN IMUTIYZ. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Truth at last is working its course with the public in this country and vindicating the character of our countrymen in India from the apersions of the local Govern. mnent. The sight of a proclaration, which we might be content to call silly but for its mo6t mischievous tendenoy, has made us all indignant eTeve at this ditasni, How, then, n ust it be with those who are not only daily witnesses of but sad sufferers from a continued series of measures and proceedings of wvbich this proclamation is but one item, which have facilitated the development of mutiny and revolt, and everywhere emboldened tho ill-disDosod to raise the standard of massacre and plunder. We now learn that vhile Mr. John Peter Grant is reported to have been nentralzing the beneficial resnjts of General Neill's prompt and effective ieasures for the restoration of tranquillity and order at Allahabad, and CawnFore and the nei4hbouring country, the same system of insane conciliation and concession to the most notorious and troublesome conspiratkr3 bas been introduced at Patna. The Calcutta Eanglidman informs us that many of those imprisoned by the former commissioner of the dis rict had been released through the influence of a Mahomedan lately appointed principal assistant to Mir. William Taylor's successor. The appointment of this native gentleman on a salary of 150t. per month to a post ot so much trust and power had been lceudly condenired by the Christian community of Calcutta; but, as on every other occasion, no heed was taken of such complaints. Sorely, nothiug can be more prejudicial to the restoration of our autbority and he prestige of our name in India th ,n this display of vacillation by undoing the auts ot those placed b12her in Fower and authority at so critical a period, when hosts of traitors and conspirators were bent upon the indiscrimninate n assacre of all Christians, of whatever creed or colour. The responsibility for the extension of revolt and mutiny not only to the imnmee ata neighbourbood of Patna, hut over the entire districts of Bebar and Shahabad, and for the consequent loES of life and proper'y. and the increase of difficulties in the rear of Generals Havelook, Outram, and Neill, cannot be transferred to an innirm and decrepit old general, nor in auy respect to the late active and energetic commizsioner of Patna, but the entire blame for these disasters must rest wvith those who not only turned a deaf ear to tbe warning and repeated cries of the public, but who appear wilfully to have closed thbir eyes upon the most glaring facts In the month of July the Governor(General had been solicited by petition to disarni the Dinapore regiments, well known to be disaffected and ready for ncischief, urged on and instigated by the Mabomedans of Patna; but again to no purpose; the passive and confidiog policy of the past still prevailed, as it does even now, resultiDg in the increase of our difficultles and a fearful smcriice of life and property, commencing with the loss of 200 of our brave soldiers in their noble tff rt to rescue the 12 gentlemen at Asrra, It is a fortunate circumstance that the Governor General and the Calcutta clique of civilians, who appear to have complete influence over him, have been unable tv carry their interference into the Punjab, and with Generals Wilson and Nicholson and the glorious band of herces at Delbi. It Is surely manifest to the dullest comprehension that while on the ore hand the passive, lenient, hesitating, tatdy, and meddlitg line of conduct unhappily pur>ucd in the Bengal Presidency has not only facilitated the progress of mutiny and the massacre of our fellow.countrynmen, but has equally increased the necessity for oxterded warfare and inevitable bloodshed and retribution; on the other hand, the i reventive, prompt, stern, and determined pollcy of Lord Elphinstone and Sir J. Lawrence has proved by far the most merciful, considerate, and humane, for by immediately in9icting condi;u punishment on all rnucincers and conspi. rators they overawed the expectant and deprived them of all hopes of success. Let such as cry out for tenderness to fiendish murderers, remorseless assa5sins, and perjured traitors bear this in mind, wben dlsposed to censuro tbose who loudly demand that such guilty wretches shall receive the recompense of their bloody and execrable deeds.

MILITARy AND NA 7AL IrTELLIaGEPg0 The 68th Regiment, quartered at Portsmouth, and the I'Jth, will be the next regiments sent to India. The 68th will be presented with new colours on the 6th on Southaea. commcn, weather permitting. The Diadem, 32, screw corvette, CAptain Moorsom, is Le be submitted to a series of mechanical experiments, with the view of developing her xteam power, her speed being at present very unsatifactory, An order was yesterday received at Chatham from the War-offico by the officer commanding the 3d battalion, directing the reinforcementb for tho 60th Royal Rifles to be held in readiness to embark for Madras, for the purpoee of ioining tho head-quarters of their corps. The officer o0dered to proceed to india in charge of the reinforeements are Ensign W. L E. OgUvy and EnzignlH.St. George Burton, 3d Battalion 60th idfle. Yeterday an inspection of the whole of the troopt be. longig to the reveral India depOts at Chatham took place with the view of returns being made to the War-office of the number of non-commissioned officers and men fit for service in India. The troops belonging to the West India regiments who are Dow attached to the 2d Battalion at Chatham have keeu directed to proceed to Southamptou, where they wi l tuba3k to join the head-quarters of their respective regiIents in the West Indies. About F-) youzg nmen have recently joined the head quarters of the Royal Engineers at Brompton-barrackls, th. wbole of whom ate skilled artisans, and will roVe & a Luable acdiuon to that brsach of the service. On inquiry at the Admiralty, War Department, and *.ther offices, it has been ascertained that no acconats of damage to the Hydaspts havo been received, and there is reaecn to believe that no foundation exists for the report respecting this rhip which appeared in a morning paper yesterday. The Spartan, 26, Captain Sir William Hoste, which arrived at Plymouth on Sunday, has been in commission five years and a-half, during which time she has seen much Eervice. She left England in July, 1852, and arrived at Eangoon dunng the war in Bnrmah, January, 1853. Thence she proceeded to Hfongkong, Sir William Hoste having been appointed senior officer on the coast of China; she remained until August of that year, and wbile there her boats were constantly employed in the suppression of pirany In August she was sent as senior officer's ship to Shanghai that place being at the time in possession of the rebels. Her ifficers and crew were landed and performed garrisot di y for the protection of the foreign settlements for fix months. 6he was docked at Whampoa in February, 1554, and then proceeded to Singapore, returning to Hongkong in May, when Sir William Hoste was again appointed senior officer in China. Doring the sBtmu er her boats were constantly and mest successfully employed in the destruction of pirates. Her Senior Ileutenant Palliser was promoted fcr his conduct in a gallant affair against a large pizatical force in the island of Tylo. In January, 1855, she proceeded as senior officerso sLip to the Canton river, and daring the disturbanoes between the rebels and the Imperial Government was of n uch service in the protection of British Interests. In March she was despatched to crnise off the Kurile Islands, and remained there and in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Gulf of Tartary, and the coast of Eastern ,IVefia until the end of October. She thenireturned to H oDgkorg, visiting on her way down the principal ports of Japan. In .ovember, 1855, she left Singapore, her gaUant captain having been again appointed senior in the straits of Malacca. The Spartan w. s actively employed ruising in the straits and on the coast of Borneo for the protection of British interests and the suppression of piracy until July last, when she left for England. Her crew have been comn paratively heAlthy, considering herlengthened service in the Indian seas. lDuring her commission she has sailed upwards of 70,000 miles, and brings 47 invalids from the squadron5 In China and on the coast of Airica, of whom five died on the passage. A couple of Tro tnan's patent wrought iron anchors forged at Liverpool, have been received at Woolwich, vweighing nearly seven tona each, and one was yesterday subjected to a trial proof under the ordinary testing apparatus in tho dockyard. The proof commenced vith a pressure of 20 t-us, and the committee of competent naval authorities who were present to verify the proceedings resolved to apply a Eraduated strain up to 100 tons. No indication of weaLness a as observ.able until the pressure amounted to 94 tone, but 'then the scarf of the crown gave way with a sudden crack, which on examir,ation was folnd to rr-ceed from a sep-ra. tir.n of the welied ir n iimmediately beneath the pivo: on vwhich the crownv of the anchor works to and fro.

THE REP 9RTED LOSS OF THE HYDASPES STEA MER. SO0 UTHAMPTON, MOynAY. Rsimonrs baving been industriously circulated, both iii London and this port, and given great prominence to In two morning journals of to-day, of the less of the screw stealmship Hydaspes, on her way to India with troops, every inquiry has been made to ascertain vwhether they have any foundation in fact, but nothing can be discovered to give the rujisours in question the slightest confirmation. The agents of the company to which the Hydaspes belongs. Messrs. Croskev and Co., have set an inquiry on foot, and believe the story to be entirely groundless. It was stated that the inteillgence was received by the Admiralty last night, but we tmderstand that no such report has reacbed that body. The Hydaspes left England on the 19th unt., and not on the 27th, as stated in one of the papers referred to. Her safe arrival at St. *Vincent'shas been reported.

FORBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FnoM ou0 OWN OomRsrONDxNT.) [A portior. of the folowing appeared In our scond ed&. tion of vesielA:-I PARIS, SUNDAY, Nov. 1, 6 rP. The Paris papers of this morning agree in eulogizing General Csvaignac. Some do so less briefly than others; they differ in their reasons, but there is unanimity in their praise of him The Monitur has these few words-" The obsequies of General Cavaignac were celebrated thi morning (yesterday) in the Church of St. Lou d'Antln I)etachments of the different corps of the Paris garrison paid the military honours to the ilustrious dew" The honours, by the way, to which he was strictly entitled from his rank were those of a General of Division on the retired list. At the Emperor's desire, he received those of a General of Division in activity, and as if he commanded in chief at the moment of his death. A cast of the General's head has been taken by the sculptor Jeauron, and it is said that his portrait as ex-chief of the Executive Government will aso, at the desire of the Emperor, be placed in the Picture Gallery of Versailles, A number of distinguished persons, and also several of the members of the Diplomatic Corps, left their names yesterday at the house of Madame C&vaignac. A committee was to be formed with the view of collecting subscriptions to erect a monument to the Genera], but his widow thanked those who proposed it, and declared that she should reaerve that duty for herself. A military plan of Paris Is in progress at the Waroffice. It Is said to be very curious, and It admirably comblnes artistic and ornamental with strategic merit. The intrigues of the various fractions which contend for place and power in Madrid, and which employ every means, however unscruDulous, to overthrow the rivals whom chance or caprice has most favoured, will, I apprehend, have little 3nterest in presence of the great events which now absorb public attention. They are, howevevr, not entirely without their use; if they are not novel or instructive, they are at all events amudng. The following details, emanating from a person who is a witness of that burlesque spectacle will give some notion of the way in which Government are called into ephemeral existence in the Spanish Peninsula. He writes from Madrid under date the 28th of October:- " This morning iM. Mon, with a careful regard to the stability of his Cabinet, commissloned one of his most Iutl. mate and faithful fronds, who formerly occupied a respon. sible post abroad, to secure In his interest the two great 'influences' now in the Palace. The negotiator had riready done his utmost to that effect. He made the most tempting offers to a certain lady and gentleman whose names ar weU known to the public, and to whom the highest personage Is under obligations for personal servlces zealously and faith. fully rendered. In truth, the countenance of the two individuals in question is absolutely necessay even to the Armero-Mon Minstry, as the rival interest, which also bas Its seat in the Palace, has already begun a deadly warfare against the new Ministers. The King and the Camarilla of which he ic the nominal chief are deodedlyhostile to them. With a view to counter. balance or neutralize this secret element of distactlon, M. Mgon Is desirous that Queen Chrlstina should return to Spain as soon as possiblo. That lady Is in no great hurry to do so; but her husband, the Duke de Rianzares, who Is out of his element in Parisim society, but who Is an Important personage in Madrid, is never content when away from his country. The Minsters have Intimated to more than one important member of the Moderado party that they have no desire to ally themselves with the Vicalvarists; and, In point of fact, no one of any weight In that party has entered the Cabinet, and M. Salverria, the Intimate friend of the mysterious person who Is for the moment predominant, Is of no politica1 signification whatover. O'Donnel2 Is furious against Mon and Armero; he oonsiders himself In some measure duped, seeing the 'ntimaoy that existed between them In 1I54, at the period of the Manzanares manifesto. That manifesto demanded, among other things, 'The Throne without the Camarillas which diahonour it,' and, thinks O'Donneli, 'Mon and Armero have risen to power on the wlngs of a Camarills, and have not given any share to the Vicalvarists.' He wlUl probably menace them with disclosures in the Senate, showing their sympathy towards that rising, just as he did with Narvaez. The Queen, It appears, really abhors the party, and the name the Vicalvarite get in the Palace is the ' Sepoys of Spain.' " The public is amused with the rumours of a quarrel said to have occurred yesterday between AL Mon and Alexander Castro, late Spanish Mbinter at Turin, on account of the way he is treated. Castro fancied he had a promise from Mon that he should be his colleague in the Ministry. He was so certain of the fact that he went about among his friends distributing places as if he were already n poasession. Of these friends some now tarn with anger on him, and others laugh at him.

He obtained It yesterday, and will set out on his return to Paris in a fortnight. "The uncle of the 'Influence,' MI. Mayans, is the Minis. terial candidate for the Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies. They did not venture to make him Minister of Grace and Justice. His near relationship to 'our frlend' in thePalace would have too forcibly attracted public attention. But the person who appears to have been exerting himself vehemently, for the last two days, against the Cabinet is Marshal Narvaez, who bw been sudderly seized with a mania to be Minister; and he counts upon the Queen sending for him before her accouchement. This, I fear, is nothing but an illusion. As long as the present linfluence' prevails Narvaez must give up all hope of being anything in the country. He has taken a house in the Plazuela de Barajos, and intends spending the winter in Madrid. As to the line that may be taken by the Cabinet, nothing can as yet be said; but all in good timne.

(PROA OUR OWU CORRESPONDM.) BEIRLIN, Oor. 31. The King continues to gain health and strength, if not very rapidly, at least very steadily; on Thursday afternoon he was able for the first time to venture into the open air, and enjoyed on this occasion the genial influence of the autumn sun on the terrace of Sans Sou¢i; His Majesty walked up and down there for some minutes leaning on the arm of the Queen, and was joined there by the Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg Schwerin. This visit to the terrace was repeated again yesterday, and lasted for a somewhat longer period than on the former occasion; but it is not correct, as currently reported here, that His Majesty has already been able to drive out. The statement is very asbiduously spread about by a certain clique at Court that the King is already "quite well, thoroughly restored, only a little weak-quite himself again " these statements are made with reference to the course that must be taken on the determination of the three months fixed in the King's Cabinets-ordre for the duration of the Pzince of Prussia's proxy; for, with the sole exception of the King's death, they fear nothing more than a Regency, which would exclude their small solves from all importance In the State, and enable the Eing to travel to foreign perts. The Kng will not remove to Charlottenburg till the end of next week, at which period the Prince of Prussia Wil ao tak& up his reeidenco in Berlin, and be joined here by the Prince from Coble" Her Royal Hlghneu will, it is presumed, arrive here in time for the Queen's flue or Saint's-day, on November 19. The passage in the Prince of Prussia's manifesto, issued on occasion of his assuming the conduct of public business, which states that he intends, during the term of his proxy, to rule "according to the intentions of the King as known to bimself," is mFintained by the Ereuz Zeitung park' to be a declaration of the Prince's adhesion to fteir principles and views. This representation, however, is still more remote from the truth than that which always represented the Ring as of the same turn of mind as that party is, and put forward the Kreuz Zeitung as his organ. The Prince of Prussia has nothing in common with the principles of the Kreuz Zeitung party, and the King next to nothing. The whole party sees itself at length deprived of any remsining shadow of influence in the present, as, since the settlement of the marriage of Prince Frederick William with the Princes Royal, It had seen itself deprived of any chance for the fulture; and it is clutching desperately at every straw of mnisrepres entation to uphold its sinking existence. In the Prince's declaration there ia nothing more than the straightforward common-sense view of his real position. He intends to act according to the intentions of the person whose proxy he in. I lately mentioned that the present was not the only occasion on which the Prince of Prussia had been intrusted with the temporary conduct of publio business, and that he had already received a similar power of attorney from the King on the occasion of the latter's viaiting Enggland to stand godfather to the Prince of Wales m 1842. There was also a more recent instance of this substitution, which escaped my memory at the time-viz., when the King left here on a journey toIly (August 20, 1847); on that occasion, a8 on the present, the entire military and civil business of the country was committed to his hands. On a much earlier occasion also-viz, in 1818, when the late EKing, Frederick William IIL, accompanied by the then Crown Prince (the now reigning King), went to St. Petersburg to return the numerous visits of the Emperor Alexander I., the military affaira of the entire army were coramitted io the management of the Prince, though at the time only 21 years of age; the conduct of the civil affair of the kingdom waa at the same conjuncture intrusted to Prince Hardenburg, the Chancellor of State, and the period of the King's absence from his dominions vas two months. Among the first acts of the Prince after his entrance on his functions were frequent exertions of a Royal prerogative unknown to our Constitutlon-viz., the granting of permission to officers of the army to marry; and, as very often happens here, where the nobility is for the most part poor, and has no other form of employment thanii the army the granting of yearly allowance, of money tosuch deserving officers as do not possess, either themselves or through their intended spouses, an income of 1,50 thalers a-year. In addition to these numerous applications, of so very pressing a nature to the principals concerned, must be mentioned all the applications for leave of absence on the part of military men; for licences to open shops or undertake any commercial enterprise; and, what was most preesing of all, to give permission for the resumption of hilarious public amusements, such as dancing, farces, &c., which had been suspended as long as the King was believed to be in danger Terr von Niebuhr, the King's Private Secretary, will, it is trusted, shortly be in a position to refute the news which the Nord about 10 days ago published of his death. He had lately returned home much invigorated from a four weeks' holyday, when the news of the King's dangerous illnems summoned him at once to Potadam, and almost immediately produced in him a relapse into a worse state than be was in previously to his holyday. His incessant attention to a variety of very arduous subjects during the early part of this year had entirely overthrown his health, at no time strong, and his physicians had strenuously inculcated the necemity of many months' abstinence from business and a trip to Italy. Instead of this, he had restricted himself to a four weeks' absence in order that he might be on the spot when the Finance Commiasion should meet here. This Is a select committee of the Ministers of State, assisted by various members of the S&aatsrath, wvhich was to have been summoned to deliberate on the necessary reforms in the financial system of Prussia; and it seems now, apparently in consequence of laerr von Niebuhr's illness, that this committee will not sit at all previous to the opening of the next Diet, which Is now fixed definitively for next January. The telegraph brought us the news from Frankfort yesterday that the Duchy of Lauenburg had the previous day made an appeal to the German Federal Diet to protect it from the unconstitutional encroachments of the Danish Government on its chartered rights, in conformity with a resolution passed to that effect by the Estates of Lauenburg during thei last Diet. In connexion with this appeal the representative of Prussia at the Federal Diet has also moved there that the state of affairs as between the Duchy of Holstein and the Danish Government should be taken into consideration, wlth a view to ulterior steps to be taken by the German Confederation. The representative of Austria at Frankfort has also received instructions from his Government to second this motion, so that it wiiU in due course be referred to a committee to deliberate and report on; but it is not to be expected, from the character of the Federal Asembly, or of the Governments represented in it, that any very rash or speedy resolution will be come to. Simultaneously with the issue of the Prussian instructions to its representative at Frankfort to bring this matter officially before the cognizance of the Federal Diet, this Government issued a circular despatch to its representatives at all the Federal Courts, laying openxthe state of the case, and calling on each Government to instruct its representative at Frankfort as to its pleasure on the subject. It has been a very natural conclusion here and elsewhere that this instruction to the Prussian representative at Frankfort to make thisr motion at the Diet was one of the first acts of the Prince of Prussia's provisional governrment, and, in so far as the last definitive command to do this is concerned, it was so, but the written instructions for it were drawn up at an earlier date (viz., 21st inst.), while the Prince only entered on the management of afrais on the 23d. The circular despatch also probably bears the earlier date, in anticipation of the well-known intentions both of the King and the Prince. I mentioned lately that the Kreuz Zeitung had stated very positively, as though perfectly sure on the subject, that the French Government had been Wnformed by its representative at one of the more important German Courts that it must not any longer count on the assistance of Russia in Its unionistic endeavours In the Danubian Principall. ties. The same journal states now, with equal positiveness, that " in the month of June of this year a convention was concluded between England and Austria, in virtue of which the latter is empowered to reckon on the gooad offices of the former in case of any revolutionary movement ensuing in Italy." The two statements are sufficiently far removed from improbability to make it worth a politician's while to inquire Into the truth of them, but they must not be understood as having acquired any authority by being put forward by the Kreuz Zeitung. This journal now is again as furiously Auistrian as it lately was Russian; its advocacy having of late been frequently repudiated by the organs of the Russian Government, on account of its signal unskilfulness, it is now exhibiting a considerable amount of ungrateful malignity towards that State, and is as ready now to assert everything favourable to Austria as it formerly was to do this by Russia. "CTh, revient toujours d ses premiers amours." AUSTRIA. (AYRO oX oUW 0o0RMWpoiDWs,T VrENNA, OcT. 30. The lat number of the Fran7cfort Post Zeitung, a paper which is known to be in intimate connexion with the Austrian Foreig'-office, confirms my statement that the Imperial Government had promised its support to Prussia before the Berlin Cabinet directed M. Bismark to bring the case of " Holstein v. Denmark" before the Bund. The representative of Prussia bas not yet executed the orders of his Government, because he and Count Rechberg, the Austrian Minister, must previously officially inform the Bund " that the endeavours of its mandatories (Austria and Prussia) to persuade the Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg to fulfil his federal duties have failed." After indulging in a little harmleas bombast, the 9rankfort paper remarks that the world will soon see that Prussia and Austria have not pledged themselves to any Power or Powers not to bring the question of the German Duchies before the Diet; but, in spite of her big words, there is a strong impreeaion on my mind that Austria in very desirous to find maeans of settling the dispute between the Crown of Dernmrk and its German States without an appeal to the Confederation. The mneasure might lead to an armed demonstration sgainst the former, as Hanover, Bavaria, and some of the other second-rate Germai Powers are extremely angry with Denmark, and Austria does not consider it worth her while to quarrel with any of the great European Powers in order to please federal allies on whose symp3thy and assistance she can never securely calculate. That there will be some loud talking at Frankfort is certain, but the Confederation ia comrosed of such heterogeneous elements that it will hardly venture to send troops of execution against Denmark if France and Russia should object to its doing so. Yeisterday M. Goldscbmidt, a Frankfort barrister, laid before the Diet the complaint of the LIauenburg "Estates" against the Danish Government. The charges brought by the Estates are, that the constitution, rights, and privileges of the Duchy of Lauenburg have been infringed by the Duke, and that the timber on its domains has been felled and sold for the sole benefit of the kingdom of Denmark, which proceeding is contrary to law and equity. Jn my letter of the day before yesterday it was stated that Baron Werner, the Tinder Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was said to have remon-I strated with Baron Budberg against the closing of all the ports on the Circassian comt with the exception of Anapa, Souchum-Kalelh, and Redout-Ealeh, but remarks have since been made in my presence which lead me to believe that the A:ustrian Government does not think theRussians have been guilty of any breach of treaty. It would even appear that the Porte entertains the same opinion, for on Monday, the 19th inst., Machouk Pasha, the director of the port of Constantinople, sent for the captains of the Turkish vessels that were lying at anchor, and informed them that in future they had to abstain from going to the Circassian coasl with passengers and merchandise. Yesterday at mid-day the Acadermy of Science took formal pomemion of the edifice which was known as the University of Vienna before the year 1848. Baron Bach, who as Minister of the Interior is protector of the Academy, made a speech, in which he brought the munificence of the Emperor, who not long since placed the building at the disposal of the institultion, Into remarkably strong relief. TheVice-President,Yon Karajan, gave a short historical account of the building, which was construted bytheEmpresM ariaThepx, and served as a univeraity forl10 years, and. as a barrack for nine. This last fact, however, the learned speaker forgot to mention. After the Vice-President had concluded his discourse the ceremony ought perhaps to have ended, but Professor von Ettingshausen was unwilling to allow such a favourable opportunity of making himself heardto escape him, and he therefore gave the members of the Academy and a great crowd of visitors a terriblys long dissertation on physics. The Minister for Public Instruction and Ecclesiastical Affairs has recently attempted to impose a moral constraint on the profesors at the university. He isiued an order that all the students should attend the "holy efflce" (mass and sermon) in the University Church on Sunday and holydays, and requested the professors to do so likewise. As a matter of course, the young people obey, but the gray-headed seniors decline to listen to the nonsense of the Jesuit preachers. The news contained in the Fresch and German papers relative to the evacuation of Ancona by the Austrian troops on the 30th September is incorrect. There was a partlal change of garrison, inasmuch as the infantry regiment Einsky marched out of Ancona, and the infantry regiment Gyulai marched in. Some time since reinforcements were sent to Cattaro, at the request of Baron Mamula, the Military and Civil Governor of Dalmatla, and very recently orders have been issued to strengthen the Austrian forces In the Banat and Servian Voivodina. Some of the leaders of the Democratic party In Wallachia have taken up their residence In Little Wallachia, and the Austrian Government probably fears that the revolutionary propaganda may find its way across the frontier. Our papers contain detailed reports of the numerous robberies and murders which are committed inHungary, but a brief account of two or three of them will suffice to give a correct idea of the way in which matters are generally managed in that Austrian land of promise. In tha evening of the 13th, while it was stiU light, six men, armed with double-barrelled guns, entered the housa of a wealthy peasant in the Szalad country and demanded his money. As the man refused to say where he kept it, the ruffians bound him, stabbed him in the soles of his feet with their knives, and four times strewed glowing embers over his body. The booty carried off was large. On the 19th inst., in the afternoon, M. von Nagy, a landed proprietor, was attacked in his house by five robbers, who carried off 12,000fl. and a new double-barrelled gun. In the evening of the 16th inst., three robbers, "who were armed to the teeth," entered an inn kept by a Jew in Weszprlnm county, and struck him about the head with their hatchets until he was senseless. They then robbed him of about 500of., and, after having " torn" his wife's rings out of her ears, walked quietly away. As has already been said, the Gendarmes, who are not sufficiently numerous in Hungary, receive little support from the troops and none from the people. Count Buol, who returned to the Foreign-office last night, has already received the visits of some of the membera of the Diplomatic Body. The Emperor and Empress will be back in Viemna on the lat of November. A vast deal of business is said to have accumulated during the last few weeks, so that the return of His Majesty is looked forward to rith extreme impatience. The Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetia kingdom is travelling in the districts which have been inundated by the Po and Ticino, hut the A rchduchess Charlotte is at Milan, where she is awaiting the Archduke Francis Charles and the Archduchess Sophis, who were expected to arrive on the 28th inst. The semai-official bske Novine thus publicly accuses the ex-Hospodar Milosch of being concerned in theplot againsthis succesor, Prince Alexander:- " During the examination of the persons arrested it was proved that some of the conspirators had received money from Prince Milosch. His Plenipotentiary, Dr. P3tz-l brought 5,000 ducats here, and 1,000 of them wero given ts the hired sassain" The Belgrade correspondent of the Pesth Lloyd writes:-" The general impression here is, that the Russians had nothing to do with the conspiracy." Miloach Obrenowitsch, who is a man of about 80 years of age, has always been desirous to reinstate his dynasty in Servia, and it is a notorious fact that his descendant, Prince Michael, who resideb in this city, received a very sharp reprimand from the Austrian Government about three years ago for agitating against the reigning Hospodar of Servia. MIany Milan families are reduced to great distress by the failure of Ballabio, who has absconded. M. Guttman, a commission agent at Pesth, absconded on the 22d, leaving behind him debts t3 the amount of about 10,0001. TURKEY. (FROM OUR OWN CORRSrOl-DSNT.) CONSTANTINOPLE, Ocr. 24. The telegraph, that formidable rival of correFpondents, will have already told you that the Ministerial crisis is over, and that It has trned ou, in an unexpected manner. The Ministry afte- more than two months' delay thought itself at las strong enough to remodel itself, and instead o being remodelled it was dismissed, and Redschid named Grand Vizier. Early in the morning of the 22d Redschid was caUed to the Palace, and received the seals of office from the Sultan. Fethi Ahmed returns to the Ordnance, and Riza to the War Department. In order to understand this change, which is natural enough although it came unexpected, you must remember the circumstances under whica Redschid came into and went out of office. When he entered it he tried everything in his power to remove the Idea which was attached to his namethat he was, namely, ablindcpartisanrofEngland, and consequently just as blind an enemy of France. He not only kept his most decided adversaries ai Ministers without a portefeuile, and helped to obtain handsome pensions for them, but he overcame even the long-standing dislike of the Sultan against Riza, and appointed this latter, who passes for a partisan of France, to the Ministry of War. He endeavoured to show the greatest impartiality in all his relations with the foreign representative., and to break thus through the tradition which assigns to every Turkish Minister one of the representatives as his confidential adviser. His efforts were in vain, and his Intentions wero misunderstood. When the French policy in the PIrincipalities became more and more opposed to that which the Grand Vizier thought the most sitable to the interests of his country his oppouitiou to the views of the French Government were attributed to a leaning towards the British Ambassador, who supported the opposite opinion. Redschid seeing that the question had taken a personal tra, gave in his resignation and retired to the Council of the Tanzimat, hoping thus to remove an obstacle to an understanding. The Osborne conference settled the disputed question of the elections in favour of the French view; but, not satisfied with this succeas, Redschid Pasha was represented to the Sultan as the cause of the whole misunderstanding, and as a person whose presenee in any Cabinet was an obstacle to an entente between France and Turkey. The Sultan yielded, you will remember with what bad grace. He made Redachid's resignation a triumph rather than a disgrace, and it was not difficult to foresee that he would seize the first opportunity to replace him. The difficulty which the successors of Redschid found in forming a Cabinet helped his designs. It afforded time to ascertain indirectly whether the French Government really entertained that preju. dice a rainat Redschid Pasha which it had been represented as having, and whether it was not rather an exaggeration easily accounted for by local circumstances. The answer seems to have been in the latter sense. It was, I believe, this assurance that the French Government did not think Redchid's person objectionable, which contributed considerably to remove any remaining objection in the mind of the Sultan as weU as of Redschid. That the Sultan chome to restore Redschid to power just at the moment when the Ministry was on the point of constituting itself definitively waa one of those satisfactions of amout propre which have more meaning here .than in Europe. It acted like a thunderbolt, and is more calculated to increase Redschid Peaha's prestige than any other real concession; and prestige-the conviction that Redschid i really high i favour-is the first and most necessary condition of the success of his admiistration. Everybody sees the abuses and every one complains of them, but no one dared to touch them for fear of making powerful enemies, without even the 3atisfaction of succeeding. The usual policy is therefore to tolerate certain services, and overlookno end of weaknewses, and use both as far aa it Is possible for a good purpose. It is almost superfluous to say that this policy of compromise tends only to remedy small evils, but leaves the whole as a system intact. The best illustration of this Is afforded by the change of the governors in the provinces. Complants arise against one of them; at first his friends will try everything to support him, audto showv that the abuses he is charged with are unfounded; when at last the facts speak too clearly they give in and he is recalled. But Tery likely the man whose weighthelped most to remove hiim kas already some protge himself who cannot be refused, and who will do exactly the same as his predecessor, and will probably be recaDed in the me way. I believe in many instances it was not want of will, but the want of power in the head of the Government, which prevented improvementa. If any man can acqluire this power it is Redschid Pasha, and there lies his great superiority over all his competitors. The Sultan has more confidence in him than in anybody else, and, strong in the support he derives from this favourable position, I have no doubt of his success were it not for the opposition which he encounters from abroad, and which ties his hands. Unless this ceases, as the assurances of the French Government may let us hope, his efforts to introduce ameliorations in the interior, on which everything depends, will be just as unsuccessul as durng hi late administration, when he had so fight venomous diplomatic battles instead of turning his attention and energy to a more useful purposs.

The official organ of the Swedish Government, the Svensa Tidning, has already published a very severe article against Germany, taxing the Germans with a desire to posses themselves of the Duchies by means of unjust interference with Danish rights.

This return comprises the births and deaths regiate!ed by 2,196 registrars in: all the districts of England during tte summer quarter that ended on the 30th of September, and the marriages in 12,247 churches or chapels, about 3,188 registered places of worship unconnected with the established church, and 628 superintendent reglstrazs' offies, in the quarter that ended on the 30th of June, The marriages and the births in the present returns are above the bverage numbers. The deths exhibit a rato of mortality below the average of the sown, but higher than the rates of the corresponding seasons of the two prevlous years. Darrhcea has prevailed in many districts, and a few fatal cases of cholera of a Bevere type have been registered. MABRRAGES. 82,592 persons were married in the three months that ended in June last; or nearly 1,720 In every 100,000 persons living. This exceeds the average of the quarter for the 10 previous years (1,698). The 41,296 marriages exceed by 2,500 the marriages in the spring quarter of last year, and by 2,747 the marriages in the spring quarter of the previous year. A corresponding excesa is observable in all the dlvi. dODs except the nortfhern; wher the decrese of marriage5 In Sunderland, South Shields, NewcastI, Tynemouth, and some other coal districts has reduced the number of marriages in Durham and Northumberland, The marriages in Cumberland dunring the three quarters ending June 185D.6-7 were 2S8, 303, 36L The births of 161,215 living children were registered in the quarter that ended on the lst day of September. This number exceeds by 3,582 the births in the corresponding quarter of the year 1856, and -is the greatest number of births that ever occurred in England during the summer months. The birth-rate of the quarter was 3 308 per cent. It has been only onoe exceeded in the sutmmer quarter,-ln 1851 the rate was 3 -317. The births in the first six montlw always greatly exceed in number the births in the lst six months of the year in England. INCREASE OF POPUL&TION. The births were 161,215, the deaths 100,590; consequently, the recorded natural Increase of population in Bnrglnd and Wales is expressed by 60,625. The n%tural increase of population In the unlted kingdom was probably about 1,000 souls daily. 51,994 emigrants sailed from the ports of the unlted kingdom at which there are Government emigration officers. Of this number 18,725 were ascertained to be of English origin; and, allowing for a duo share of the 5,516 whore origin was not distinguished, the probable number of English emigrants may be set down at 20,947. 10,197 of the number sailed to the United States, 1,707 to our healthy North Axmerican colonies, 8,947 to the Australian colonies, and 96 to other places TEE WEATHER AND TH PRICxE or PRsOvoNS. These elements affect the births, deaths, and marriages directly and indirectly. The weather is fully described by Mr. Glaisher; and his account of the meteorology of this remarkable season Well merits perusaL The temperature of July, August, and September was considerably above the average of the same months in the last 86 years. Since the year 1771 the temperature of July has only been somewhat exceeded 13 times. Since 1771, a date as far back as trustworthy records extend, the temperature of the month has never been so high as it was in August last, and the temparature of the month of September waa only exceeded six times In one year only (1818) out of 86 years did the temperature exoeed the temperature of the three summer months. July and Augast were less, September was more humid than usuaL} Little rain fell in July; the average amount fell in August. the rain-fall in September was above th4 average. Asa general rule the temperature of A thermometer with itsbuLb on the grass fals in every month below the freezing point (32°);but it is o remarkable fact that at Greenwlch the thermometer so plaeAd never fell below 30 degrees in the last three months. The average price Of wheat was 76s. ld. And 72s. 3d. in the two periods of 13 weeks endiDg Septeaber, 1855, and September, 1854; it fell to 59s. lid. in the 13 weeks ending September, 1857. Wheat is consequently 17 per cent. cheaper than it was lst year. The price of beef by the carcass in the Leadenhall and tho Newgate markets has fallen in thethree summers from5id. to5Rd.per pound; that is, 8 per cent. The price of mutton by the carcas has fallen from 6d. to 5id. a pound, or 4 per cent in the same seasons: The prica of potatoes has, unfortunatelyP risen from 74s. to 78s, and to 10Ss. a ton in the three seasons . it was 42 per ceint. higher in the 13 weeks ending September, 1857, than the prices of the same season in 1855. The warcity of potatoes is likely to produce scurvy in the country, as people are not generally aware that potatoes are an anti-ecorbutic, which can only be replaced by frait and vegetables. The abundant crop of apples will supply to a certain extent the vegetable aCids which experience ha5 shown that the human frame requirs to maintain its elements in equilibrium. STATE OP THE PUBIIC H IrsRTa. 100,590 deaths were registered in the quarter ending September 30th ; and the death-rate was 2 064 per cent. The deaths in the summer quater of the previous yer were 91,330; and in tho summer of 1855 the deaths were 87,646. The excess of deaths in the last summer quarter over this number was 12,944. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 during the summer was 25 in the town districts and sub-disrcts, where 8,247,017 people dwelt iu 1851 upon 2,149,800 acres; and 17 in the other districts and sub-districts of England and Wales, where 9,680,592 people dwelt on 35,175,115 acres. The arts which have been invented In cities are now required to render their natural homes healthy. As a pre. liminary to all other steps the people must be supplied with pure water; the town manures must be restored to the disinfecting fields every day, and no longer be suffered either to remain under human dwellings, or to polilte the streets and streavs around them. If the mortality in the towns had been at the same rate as the mortality In the other districts, the deaths, Instead of amounting to 55,733, would have only amounted to 38,080. Thus in 92 days 17,653 persons perished untimely in England. What was the cause of this great destruction of life? Evidently the violation of the plain natural laws of life. And the strict observance of these laws must be of the utmost importance to the welfare of the humaa race, otherwise their violation would not be so terribly punished by the Almighty. Indeed, if the English race could lose strength, beauty, health, and life in the impurities of its dwelingplaces with Impunity, the imagination of Swift alone could conceive-his pencil depict-the depth of degrdation to which the nation might faiL The inteligent classes of this country will, however, never acquiesce in the continuance of its present Imperfect sanitary condition, and of the resulting diseases which it brings down upon the heads of the population, who often, when they violate the laws of nature, know not what they do. A summer of unusual warmth in our European clima*as not only promotes tho growth of corn and wine, but is pro. bably salutary to the human frame where the land is drained, decaying refuse is buried in the earth, and cleanlineEs is observed. Bat in England these conditions are not yet compled with; hence fever, ague, and diarrhcea havo prevailed extensively in the lasthot summer. The Registrar of Strood (Kent) has registered within one as many deaths as births. He remarks:- "This district being marshy in a great part, the poor have suffered during the last winter from ages in a greater degree than has been experienced during a, great number of year& Ague leads to debilty, and the oonsequent inabilty to earn a sufficient livelihood. An unusually hot summer has operated still more to make the marshes and adjacnt district intensely unhealthy. Many doaths have been registered from intermittent fever directly or indirectly. This disese Is rarely fatal tunder favourable circumstances). The chief mortality is among tndigent and deblitated persons and their families, who have fallen an easy prey to diseases of a general charactor in consequence of their reduced condition:" The other districts of Rent on the marshy banks of the Thames and the Medway have also experienced a mortality above their average; so has the district of Romney Marsh. Other districts of Kent, suach as Elham and Bridge, have lost few inhabitants, the mortality of these healthy places having been below the averago. While the mortality in Kent and Hampshiro exceeded the average, the mortality in Surrey (out of London) and of Sussex was about the average. 363 peraons died in Southampton out of a population amounting In 1851to 34,098, ecarlatina,whoopingcougb, and measles having prevailed. The sanitary stato of this thriving town evidently admits of improvement, in which the nation at large is interested, as it is the station of the West India and other mails. The mortality In the South Midland counties is higher than usual; 6,392 persons died in the three months. Diarrhoa was fatal at Hillingdon, Brentford, Acton, Bishop Stortford, Royston, Hatfield, St. Albans, Ramsey, Dun. stable, Cambridge, Ely, WhittleEey, and Wisbebeh. One death from English cholera was registered at lBamsey (Huntingdon), andone In Wisbeach. In the Eastern oounties tho deaths (5,677) exceeded the average number. In West Ham, Epping, Bilericsy, Chelmsford, Tendring, Colchester, sad Lemden; in Sudbury, Ipewicb, Blything, Mutford, Yamouth, Norwich, Forehoe, and Docking, the increase of deaths was onsiderable. Bilious fever, putrid sore throat, typhu3, dlarrhea, ague, soarlatina, hxve prevailed. The Registrar of BradweU says:- "There was a terrible epidemic of typhu.s in Tillingham pArish, also of mallgnant sore throat. The drainage in the part most visited by the fever in very bad. Nesly every house had from one to thme persons alk in it." One of the Registrara of King's Igqn addsl- Diarrhcea may be almos said to be universl. The high temperature has continued much longer tha usraL The illness is now accompanied with the usual remhtent ftver, which is the prevailing diseae here. The deaths. from diarrhcea seem confined to children during dentltion." Ore death from "Asiatic cholera" was regisred at Bungay; and one death from "cholera" at B"xton, in Norfolk. In the South-Western Division the deaths Increased In tbe three counties of Derset, Devon, and Cornwall; the deaths in the five counties were 7,687. Smallpox was fatW to eight persons in Wilton. Scarlatina raged in Weymoath as it only rages In bad anitay conditions. In Lerrlu (Liskeard) the Registrar reports - "The deaths (24) are nearly double the averge, and more than a third are those of children from diseas in the throat. This epidemic here generally shows itself in the form of cough and sore throat, and a pear, after arriving at a cer. tain stage, to baffle medical kill. lam told that something of a fungus nature shows itself in the throat." Croup, and what is locally called " throat fever,' also prevailed in Ee& (Truro). The West Midland Counties have suffered more than any (f the previous divisions; the deaths amowuned to ,379, The great coal and irou districts-Wolverhampton, Walsall. Westbromwich, Dudley, and Stourbrldge-are In a very unhealthy sate; the mortality has been raised greatly above the averae by smallpox, diarrhma, scarlatina, an4 typhus. One death from cholera happenedin Wolverhamp. ton, one in Wednesbury, five in Tipton, one in Sedgeley. Ig the authoritIes, who are intelligent and active in many, things, do not bestir themselves the population may again be decimated by epidemic cholera. North Staffordahir la already supplied with good water; the suDply of water lm South Staffordshire ws rewently, and Is probably still, execrable: the result are legible in the regisekr of death. The sanitary state of many English towns has undergone improvement, and the mortality hax declined in recent. years; but this has unfortunately not been the cas in the Birmingham district, nor in the dstricts immediately adjacent. Tho deaths In the three corresponding summer quarters of 185, 1856, 1857, were 920, 1,118, and 1,520 i4 the Birmingham district; 293, 353, and 529 in the Aston, district; 132, 114, and 202 in the King's Norton district5 containing Edgbaston, vwhich hs hitherto been one of the. heathiest districts In the kingdom. Diarrhoea ha been exceedingly rile. The authorities of Birmingham wDl we may hope, be stimulated by the recent meeting of the Congress of Social Scienoe to take effective stepe for the imn.t provement'of a great town which has hitherto not stood, very low in the smatary scale. The deaths in the North Midland Division exesed the deaths In the corresponding quarters of the two prevlouv years, but the mortality is not high. I4 some districts the mortalityislow. InLoughborough the Registrar says:- " The deaths are below the average. There have been fewer cases of diarrhoea than is usual at this time of the year. The populAton generally re well employed, which, with sanitary arrangements, may have tended to reduce the rate of moalt. In Ltncoln diarrhoea has been "very prevalent among childrenJ' in Horneastle diarrhoa has been "very preo valent ;" in Great Grimsby diarrhoea haz raised the deaths above the average. Worksop, Basford, Nottingham, ana Newark have also been visited by diarrhoea. In St Peter',, Derby, 31 died from dlashea. A child (11 weeks) died of "English cholera " a gentleman, 82 years old, of " English cholera (9 days) ; and a man 73 years of age of " cholera, with congestion of brain." 17,280 persons died in Cheshire and Incashre. The number of deaths exceeds the numbers in the two previous [orresponding quarters Searlatina was fatal in Stockport Runcorn, and Chester. Diarrlcea also prevailed in distrlcts of the two counties. Three deaths from cholera occurred at Heaton Norris, one of them 12 hours after the attack; one death from "Asiatic cholera," it is said, occurred at Cheadle. In Liverpool and in the West Derby district Adjoining (pop. 411,515 in 1851) 3,650 persons died, while the deaths in the corrwsponding quarter of 18Z5 were 3,C5L In Manchester, where great numbers of people visited the Exhibition, the deaths only exoeded by 79 the deaths in the summer quarter of 1855; inthe Manobestr, Balford, and Chorlton distriets (pop. 439,797 in 1851) the deatbs were 3,460. Mr. Leigh, of the Deansgate sub-dlstrict, mnakes the following judicious remarks, which deserve the careful con. dderation of the people of Manchester. Very sad there is the life of a childa- " Births 266, deaths 25 The toal number of deathba exclusive of coroners' cases, is 224, and of this number l56 were of children tnder 5 years of age, leaving a total adult mortality of only 6S Bo large a proportion I have never before known. It is evident th&t, while the ordinay circum. stances affecting adult life have been to a considerable extent in abeyance, those rmilitating against the very young have been in great activity. Of the children lot lees tan 76 were carried off by disrrhoce, 14 by whooping-coVh 6 by scarlatina, 6 by measles, and one by smallpox. 87of the children died under the age of one yer. Neglected diarrhoea, close confinement to ill-ventilated rooms during whooping. cough, want of proper nutrition, and free administaion of lauldanums, producing masmnus and convulslons, as well as hydrocephalus and congestion of brain-thes must explain why, writh a diminution of all the causes pro ducing di6ease in adults, the mortality as atotal is still so bigh" An excplosion of iiredamp at the Heys Cunlleryjkilled 40 persons in the Ashton-under.Lyne district. 10,90f7 deaths wrere registered in Yorkshire, and the mor. taklity is increasing in several districts, among wrhich are Bkipton, Hunslet, Leeds, Dewrsbury, Barusley, Sheffield' Hunll, Sculcoates, and Scarborough. Diarrhoia, typhus, and smallpox are prevailing causes. Except in Weatmoreland, the deaths in the northern counties have been somewhat in escess, in the aggregate they amounted to 5,907. Diarrhoi has prevailed here as elsewrhere, and has raised the mortality in Sunderland, Gateshead, and Newcastle. In some districts of Cumoer land the mnortality has been below the average. The Registrar of Lowr Longtown only registered '4 deaths. The deaths in Wales and Monmoutbahire amounted to 5,461L This number is below the average; acid few epidemics are menlioned by the Registrars. N ote.-The numbers of births and deaths in thls retur sie furnished by the Registrars at the end of the quarter, and have not yet been subjected to revision at the General Register-office; they w/ill therefore be found to differ in somne instances from the more correct numbers to be pub. l;shed hereafter in the annual report of the Registrar General.
BE V. DR. KE.VNEDY ON PHYSICAL ED UCATION IN SCHOOLS On Friday there were great rejoicings at Linley-hall, Shropshire,upon thecomingof ageof Mr.lRobertJasper3More, heir to the Lmley estates. A dinner, which was numerously attended, took place in a marquee on the lawn; and amon other toasts " the health of Dr. Kennedy," head-mater o} Shrewabury School, was drunk When Dr. Kennedy replied, after some predininary remarks, be said,-I shouid be content with very feve words upon this occasion were It not that lr. More has even morethan authorized me tosay a few vords upon another subject. A few days ago there appeared in The Times newspaper one of those remarkable and able articles which appear daily, many of which are charactenzed by that extraordinary admixture of powerful truth and a little falsehood which those who read that paper are tolerably familiar with. Tho article relates to the plrpqslcs education of the human being, and in it the education of the body is compared with that of the mind. The sentimnents are admirably expressed In many pointe of view, but tbere is, I conceive, an admixture of falsehood when the writer charges modern masters of schools and encouragers of learning with overtaxing the mind and not developing the powers of the body. As one of the masters of English schools-and r believe I may sueak for the mastera of Englith schools generally-I beg leave to deny the truth of that amretion altogether. With regard to the school with which I have the honour to be connected, if the writer of that article were to say that such was the cae before most Shremwbury men, they wonld laugh in his face; for, if wre were to be judged by the amount of time we give to mental bnstruction, we should acquire the charactr of a very idle schooL And I think I may venture to say there is am?le and almoet n,ore than ample time given at that school or all kinds of recreation-for cricket, football birds' nestino, boating, and all the other recreations of which the animS, genu homo species schoolboy, is known to be fond. The masters of English schools are not responsible for the over-oduc%tion or mis-education of the mind. In the course of my experience I have ween many who have suffered injury from mismanagement of one kind or other, butl have known very few cases indeed, if any, where the body has been injured and where the brain has been rendered morbid by excess of devotion to learning; although it Is true that young men who enter our colleges to prepare themselves for the higher distinctions are often tempted to give exceRssve attention to the subjects required for that purpose.

LAW REPORT. CO1ThT 0P CHANCERY T- o (Before the LoRD CflANCELLOR.) This was the first day of Michaelmas Term, aad the Lord Chancellor entertained the Judges Queen's counseL &c., at breakfast at his private residence. His Lordship took his teat in court a few mintute8 before 2 o'clock, accompanied by Lord Justice Turner and the three Vice-Chancellors. Shortly afterwards the Judges retired to their respective cou.rts. HE3QXY V. TnEB GREAT 'NORTHERN RAILWAY COIr1ANY. The LORD CHANCELLOR, addressing Mr. Daniel, said that an apphcation had been made to him in the 7acation to hear an appeal from a decree of Vice-Obancellor Wood respecting the preference shares of this company. It did tot, however, appear to him to be a case to be taken out of the usual course. The suit had been finally disposed of in the court below, and although the parties dissatLsfied with the decree might have good groutnd for an appeal, there was nothing why it should be pressed on for hearing in the vacation. He had, however, thought it right to name an early day for the hearing, and had appointed WVednesday for that purpose before the full Court of Appeal, hut as that day turned out to be an Lnconvenient one forthe Lords ttstices to attend upon, the case would be in the paper on MEonday next. DIXON V. GAYFERE. Mr. IL Palmer and Mr. Goren opened this appeal from a decreo and order of the MAster of the Rolls. Mr. Iloyd aud Mr. Ta3lor are on the other side, The case wll be proceeded with to-morrow. Messrs. Wordsworth, Locke, Skinner, Huddleston, Lush, Monk, Forsyth. and Manisty, having been appointed Queen's Counsel, and Mr. Serjeant Pigott having received a patent of precedence, were this day called within the bar.
VICE-CRANCELLORS' COURTS. Nov. 9 (lBefore Viee-C uanceUor Sir R. T. KLNDERSLEY.) The Court sat sbortly after 2 o'clock, when there belng no business to be disposed of, The VICE-CHANCELLOR roso. (Before Vice.Cetanceor Sir J. STUART.) The VICE-CHANCELLOR took his seat on the bench at about 2 o'clock, and after disposing of a few applications, none of which were of a nature to require a report, his Honour rose. (Beforc Vce- Chanccllor Sir W. P. WOOD.) TheVICE CHAN CELLOR took his seat about 2 o'clock in the Rolls' Court, shortly after which his Honour called within the bar as newly appointed Queen's Counsel the following gentlemen :-1r. Wordsworth, Mr. Locke, hl.P., Mr. Ser3eant Pigott, Mr. Skinner, Mr. Huddleston, Mir. Lush, Mr. Monk, Mr. Forsyth, and Mr. Manisty. His HONOURt then proceeded to hear a motion relating to the production of documents in the cause of " Lafone v. the Falkland Islands Company," which is not concluded.

WIaGUTMAX. and ERT.Fl This being the first day of hliohaelmas Term, their Lordships, as usual, breakfasted with the Lord Chancellor. Their Lordaships arrived in Westminster-ball a little before 2 o'clock, and immediately took their seats on the bench. THE NZW QUEEN'S COUNSEL. The following gentlemen having been raised to the degree of Queen's Counsel were, at the sitting of the Court, called to take their seats within the bar, which they did acoord. ingly, niz :-Mr, Wordsworth, Q.C., fr. Locke, Q.C., Mr. Skinner, Q.C., Mtr. Huddleston, Q.C. G;Mr. Lush, Q.C., Mr. Monk, Q.C., MIr. Forsyth, Q.C., and IMr. Manisty, Ir. SsrjeaDt Pigott, having received a patent of precedence, was also called to take his seat within the bar. SIMIPSON V. CARTER. Mfr. D. D. KwAN moved for a rule calling upon the plaintiff in this action to show cause why he ehould not answer certain interrogatorSes. The action was brought to recover damages for slander alleged to have been spoken by the defendant at a meeting of the vestry board of Chelsea, and Imputing to the plaintiff that the amusements and company allowed by him at Cremorne-gardens were of an immoral character, and had a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth. Tho defendant had obtained the leave of a judge to plead the plea of "Not guilty," and also a plea of lustificatton, and he applied to the learned judge that he might be allowed to propound interrogatories to the plaintiff; but it was objected on the part of the plaintiff, by his attorney, that the answers to the proposed interrogatories would tend to criminate the plaintfl; and were objectionable upon that ground. In consequence of this objection the learned judge referred the question to the Court. Thu learned counsel now contended that there was authority for saying that objection could not be taken unless the party himself pledged his oath that his answers would tend to crimioate him; the oath of the attorney to that effect was not sufficent-" Osborne v. the London Dock Company" (24 L. J. Ex. 140). Lord CAMIPBELL said there was no objeotion to putting the queetions; the only question was as to the liability to answer. It was clear that this was not the stage for takingI the obiection, and perhaps the plaintiff might waive all objection, and answer the questions. Mr. KE.ARE said there could be no doubt that the answers to the questions night tend to criminate the plaintiff, for they suggested that with he plaintiffs knowledge prostitutes had been allowed on his premises throughout the whole night, &c. The Court granted a rule nisi. .RE SH1ATrOCi (AR ATrORNEY.) Mr. GARTh, on the part of the Incorporated Law Society, moved for a rule to show cause why an attorney named J. Shattock should not be struck off the rolL The ground of the applcation was, that the attorney had been convicted at the last Liverpool Assizes of forging a bill of exchange, for which he was sentenced to three years penal servitude. The Court granted a rule ni,i. Several motlons for new trials were also made, but nothing occurred of public Interest.
COURT OF COMMON PLF.AS WvQ--- wr- o (,tUtngs in Banco, Michaelmas Term, before Lord Chief JQutice COCnnBUxN anld Juslces WILLIAMS, CROWDER, and WiLLEs.) The being the first day of Miobaelmas Term, the learned judges of this court took their seats on the bench at 2 o'clock. In the course of the afternoon the following gentlemen, having presented themselves, were caUed on by the Lord Chief Justice to take their seats within the bar, Her Majesty having been graoiously pleased to appoint them her counsel, and took their seats accordingly: -Mr. Wordsworth, Q.C., Mr. Locke, Q. C., Mr. Serjeant Pigott, with a patent of precedence; Mr. Skinner, Q.C., Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., Mr. Lush, Q.;., Mr. Monk, Q.C., Mr. Forsyth, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty, Q. C. THDF GZENERAL STE,AU NAVIGATION COMIPANY V. ROLT. Mr. Serjeant BYLES in this case moved by leavo for a rule to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and entered for the plaintiffs on points reserved at the trial. The action was tried before Mr. JusticeWiUes at the last sittings at the Guildhall, when a verdict was found for the defendant. The action was brought on certain articles of agreement made between one Mare of the 6Srst part, the defendant of the second part, and the plaintis of the third part, by which Mare entered Into a covenant to complete a steauivessel for the plaintiffs on or before the 13th of September, 1856, or pay 101. a-day liquidated damages, and the defendant covenanted that Mare should complete and deliver the vessel within the period stipulated. | The breaches alleged were that the vessel was not so compleled. The fourth plea to the action set olt that the vessel was to be built for 14,1201., to be paid in four oven instalmnents. About the first and second there was no dispute. The third was to be paid when the vessel was launched, and the fourth when she was completed. When the vessel was ready to launch It was agreed that she should be finishied in the bullding-yard before launching, and the third instalment was then paid. Before the vessel was finished Mr. Mare failed; meanwhile Mlr. Rolt pressed the plaintiffs for money, of which he and Mare stood in naeed, and the plaintiffs paid 2,0001. before the fourth histalment was due. Afterwards the assignees of Mare finished the vessel and she was delivered, but after the time named and required payment of the fourth instalment. For the noney so advanced, and for the damages of 101. a-day, the present action was brought against the defendant. The answer set up was that the defendant had been discharged from his covenants by the payments made by the plaintiffs. Rule nisi granted. HISHIETLD V. MASSY. In this case Mr. WELSBY moved for a rule to enter tho verdict for the defendant. The action was an ejectment, and the question turned on the construction of a u-il of an old lady named Glover. Another case on esactly the s%me point was pending before their Lordships. Rule nsi granted. RE COBBETT. Mrs. Cobbett moved for a writ of habeas cornpus cum1 causd to bring up Mr. William Cobbett, her husband, on a leDgthy affidavit, which stated that he had been arrested three times when privile ed from arrest, and had been committed to Eorsemongerlane Gaol when he had a right to be sent to the Queen's Prison. Mrs. Cobbett proceeded to state ta h ol o e justice forbher husband in the Court of Excheqe that she had been before the Chie ao tcabr to try anid get a habeas, but that a learned counsel had appeared against her application and had practised as "a gross deceiver," gettin hmself heard first and prejudicing the mind of the learned iudgeagainst her cause, and herhushaud bad in consequence neen remitted back to Horsemonger-lane GaoL Mrs. Cobbett then referred to the case of " Oldfield v. Cobbett," In relation to which her husband had been kept 12 years In prison unjustly, and she had had many sueh applications as this to make without success, until her app cations were looked upon now as foolish and ridiculous. She, however, contended that it was her husband's right by law tb be remnoved to the Queen's Prison, and also that when arrested lhe was privileged. Mr. Justice CROwVDER said, on the question of privilege, the Court of Queen's Bench had decided against her appli. cation, and he thought rightly. The LORD CiiEr JUSTICE °a;d he understood the fee of half-a-guinea. had not been paid, which was payable by statute on the transfer of a debtor from Horsemonger-lane to the Queen's Prison, and that that was the reason Mr. Cobbett had not been removed as he required. Mrs. Cobbett, with great vehemence, said she had paid e0. in fees in the case of " Oldfield v. Cobbett," and 71. 13s. in fees in getting writs in this case, and she should like very much to go into the question of fees, as it was an important one for the country- The LORD CHIEF JuSTICE.-Now, don't run on. We annot go out of the Act of Parliament; vwas the half-guinea paid. The affidavit is silent about it. hlrs. Cobbett said she did not know.v Leave was then given to her to amend the affidavit and COBPRE-r V. WARNER. Mrs, Cobbett in this oQse oigQvd to set aside a judgment in ejectmenu bnder whioh the defendant held possessioa of certain freehold lands beloDging to her husband. The LORD CIIIEF JUSTICE saw no ground for setting the indgment aside. Mrs. Cobbett then said (exciting some amusement in court) sbe should aruend her affidavit in the other case, and apply for a habeas to-mnorrow. The Court then rose.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER. Nov. 2. (.islLng un Banco.) This being the first day of Michael,nas Term, the Chief Baron and Barons Bramwell, Watson, and Channel! opened this court for the despatch of business at 2 o'clock, immediately after their arrival from the Lord Chancellor's residence. SHILLLNG V. THE ACCIDENTAL 1NSURANCE CONIPANY. Mr. Serjeant SiiEE moved for a new trial on the ground that the verdict which passed for the plaintiff for 2,0001. at the last Maidstone Aesizes was opposed to the evidence in the cause. The learned serjeant bad not concluded his statement of the facts disclosed at the trial, when, The CHIEF BAROx having expressed his dissatisfaction with the verdict, The COURT at once granted the application. TIIE OFFICE OF TUBMA1N. At the sitting of the Court to-day Mr. Ogle was called upon to take his seat as Tubman, he having been appointed to that ancient and hononrable office, vacated by the elevation of Mr. Lush to the dignity of Queen's Counsel.

INSOLVENT DBBTORS' COURT, Xo, 2. The sittings of this Court were resumed yesterday after the usual autumn vacation. Each of the three CommisBioners sat in his respective court, but the cases, although numerous, were not of much public initerest. IN BE T. H. BUXTON. This insolvent, who had been one of the directors of the City of London Deposit Society, in Farringdon-street, was heard before the vacation, and now appeared for judgment. Several persons who had deposited small sums with the society, which they had not been able to recover, appeared to complain. MIr. SARGOOD, the insolvent's counDsel, said the ruin of the society had been caused by tleo default of Br3die, the secretary, who had nowr abscouded. Mh. Commissdoner MURPHY said he should consult the Chief Commissioner before deciding upon the case, and therefore adjourned the matter until Tuesday next. fl- RF T. J. GIESON. This insolvent, who resided at Banbury, had been a director of the General Indemnity Fire and Life Assurance Company. He was opposed by fr. Joy, a printer, who, having performed certain work for the company, was paid by a bll of exchange bearing the insolvent's acceptance. The bill, when due, was not paid, and an action being brought, the insolvent obtained leave to appear, plended, and only withdrew the plea sbortly before the matter was ripe for triaL Mr. Joy complained of the insolvent's conduct in unnecessarily causing him to incur 141. law costs. The insolvent said there were men of property connected with the company whom Mr. 'Joy could have sued with every prospect of recovering his money. The opposing oreditor, however, stated that he had proceeded against some other directors, but with the same result-law costs to pay. The learned Co'LinssiozqER thought there had been a vexatious defence, and ordered the insolvent to be discharged in three months from the vesting order-a judgment which will detain him in prison about a fortnight, he having been previously at large upon bail.
CENTRAL CRJIMINAL OOURT, Monday, Nov. 2. A special session of this Court was held to-day, pursuoat to the provisions of the Central Criminal Court Act, for the purpose of fixing the days for holding the sessions for the ensuing year. Soon after 11 o'clock the following learned judges entered the court, accompanied by the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, Mr. Alderman Hale, Mr. Under-Sheriff Millard, Mr. Under-Sheriff Parker, &c. :-Chief Baron Pollock, Mr. Justice Cresswell, Mr. Justice Williams, Mr. Justice Crowder, Mr Justice Crompton, Mr. Justice Wiltes, Mr. Baron BramweU, Mr. Baron Watson, and Mr. Baron Channel] Mr. Clerk, the Clerk of the Arraigns, then said that the following days had been appointed by their Lordships for holding the Sessions of the Central Criminal Court for the ensuing year :-1S57.-Monday, Nov. 238* Monday, Dec, 14. 358t.-Mlonday, Jan. 4- Monday, Feb. 1; Monday, Feb. 22; Monday, April 5; Monday, MIay 10; Monday, June 14; Mondday, July 5; M onday, August 10; Mionday, Sept. 20, Monday, Oct. 2-ondy,5.pt 20 The Court was then adjourned. OLD COURT. (Before the CmvEF BARox.) Antonio de Salvi, who was convicted of the manslaughter of Mr. Robertson in the Queen's Bench Prison, was placed at the bar to receive the judgment of the Court. His LoRDSIHIP briefly recapitulated the circumstances of the case, and said, that it appeared he had been originaUy tried upon an indictment which contained two counts-one charging an intent to murder, and the other an intent to do grievous bodily harm, and the jury had found him guilty upon the last-mentioned count, and he had therefore been sentenced to undergo 15 years of penal servitude. The death of the person who was the subject of his violence, he said, rendered it necessary that he should take his trial upon a charge of a different character- and, having been arraigned upon an indictment for wilful murder, the jury had again negatived the intent to murder, and had found him guilty of the offence of manslaughter only. The jury were the constitutional authority to dispose of matters ofr fact, and he (the learned judge) always felt It to be his duty to give full effect to their decision; and, therefore, in this case he felt that he was not caUed upon to alter the sentence that had been passed upon the prisoner on the former occasion-that of 15 years penal servitude-except in this respect, that the sentence would date from the preeent session instead of that at which he was convicted originally. Jos6 de Rosario, the Spanish seaman who was convicted also of the crime of manslaughter, was then placed at the bar. His LORDSIIIP said, that as the prisoner did not understand tho English language It would be useless for him to make any observations in reference to the crime of which he had been convicted. The offence was a very cruel and aggravated one, and he therefore felt it to be his duty to pass upon him the same sentence as that which had been infiicted upon the last prisoner-nanely that of 15 years' penal servitude. Bridget Kavanrgh, who had also been convicted of manslaughter, was then brought up for judgment. The Cnis-E BARoN said, thatin this case the prisoner had been tried for the murder of her child, an infan' a few months old, by the administration of an ingredient which, used in moderate quantities, would be unattended with danger, but used in excess would be a deadly poisor, The jury had found that she was not actuated by the wicked and diabolical ir' ntion to destroy her child, but ;:.t she had caused its e *h by earelessly and recklessly administiring to her infant ; lasr~.- *nantity than she ough'. to have done. Ie hoped that this was the true exlanation of her conduct; bUt as the jury had given that verdict he should give effect to it, and pass a much more lenient sentence than he otherwisa should have done. He then ordered the prisier to be kept to hard labour for six months. (Before tihe RECORDER.) TAmbert Philip Moiledown, 37, a respectable-looling man, described as a dealer, was indicted for forging an order for the delivery of 300 quarters of linseed, value 7501.. with intent to defraud Messrs. Anton and Co. Mr. Robinson conducted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Sleigh. The prosecutors in this case are corn mercbants, carrying on business at the Corn-Exchange and in Fenchurch-street, a branch of the firm being also established at Altona. The prisoner carried on business in Mark-lane, and had been engaged in business transaotions with the prosecutors, and it appeared that on the 7th of September he applied to them for the advance of the sum of 7H01. upon a cargo of linseed, of which he produced a bill of lading, which purported to bear the endorsement of Lee, PRoacb, and Co. of Hull, and the prosecutor, believing the transaction to be a genuine one, advanced the money. It turned out that the prisoner had no authority to deal with this cargo, but it seemed that there had been some negotiation between the prisoner and the firm at Altona with reference to this linseed, and that a blank bill of lading had been sent to the prisoner, and it was urged on his behalf that under these circumistances he might have thought that he had authority to deal with the cargo. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty. The prisoner was then tried upon a second indictment, which charged him with uttering a forged bill of exchange for 4531. lOs. Bd., with intent to defraud the same prose- cutors. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~o wt In this case it appeared that the prisoner had purchased a cargo of grain of the prosecutors, which he paid for with several bills of exchange, purporting to be aceepted by firms at Glocester and Maidstone,which, upon inqulry,were found to have no existence. The jury in this Case returned a verdict of Guily. Sentence was postponed. James DrHscoll, 10, was charged with the manslaughter of Charles Peesey. MIr. Langford prosecuted; Mr. Meicalfe defended the It appeared that the deceased was a lad, about the samae age as the prisoner, and the circumstances under which the charge arose were of a rather singular character, Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of the 21st of September thc prisoner and the deceased were seen to come over the hedge at a place called St. Leonard's-road, Bow, and according to the evidence of one or two witnesses the prisoner was seen to make a blow at the breast of the deceased, who immediately called out " Ob, oh !" and almost at the same instant fell to the ground. He was picked up, and it turned out that he had been stabbed inthe heart, apparently by the blade of a small knife, and he died almost immediately. The prisoner shortly afterwards met a little girl in the neighbourhood and lnquirediof her if she had seen a little boy on the ground, and she told him that there was a crowd round a boy who was said to. have been stabbed, to which he replied, "I am the boy who did it." He then pulled a small knife from his pocket and opened the blade, and asked her whether she thought it would stab a boy, to which she replied, that she could not say. The prisoner then asked her if she thought that he would be hung, and e then said that he would not go home until he knewvwhat a become of the boy. A constableshortly after this went to take the prisoner into custody, and he again inquired of him whether he thought he should be hung. The constable tlhim he would not, and he then said, " I'll tell you all aboult it, I dii) 11 it, but I goould sot hselp it," The kplfe with hwhich the fatal injury was supposed to have been inflicted it appeared had not been found. Mr. METCALFE, in addressing the jury for the defence, coutended that the evidence did not at all make out the charge in the indictment, which was that the prisoner had wilfully aDd intentionally inflicted the injury upon the deceased, and he caid his instzuctions were that the wound was inflicted accidentaUy. He called as a witness a boy mamed Charles Brown, who said that he was pla3ing with the prisoner and the deceased at see-saw in the field adjoining the road, which belonged to the railway comnany, and they had no right to be there. He said that he, being the heaviest boy, was at one end of the plank and the prisoner and the deceased were at the other, and upon an alarm being given that a man was coming be jumped off the plank saddenly, and the other two boys were consequently thrown off. He also said, that he had just before given the prisoner a piece of apple, and he bad a knife in his hand and was eating it at the time he and the deceased fell off the plank, and it was suggested that as they fell the wound wa3 iofited. Several other witnesses were called who gave the prisoner the character of a mild, good-tempered lad, and quite incapable of committing such an act as the one attrilbuted to him on the present occasion. The REcoRDEB having summed up, the jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Not Guilty. George Groundwell and Henry Rubridge were indicted for the mans2aughter of William Hodgskin. Mr. Orridge prosecuted. The prisoner Groundwell waa defendedby Mr. Ribton; the other prisonerwas undefended. This charge arose out of a fight that took place between the prisoner Groundwell and the deceased in the Harrow. field& at Paddington, on the 21st of October. The facta have all been given within the last few daX a. The jury found both prisoners Guilty, but recommended them strongly to mercy. The RECORDB said, that if the fight had been the consequence of a quarrel between the men he should not have passed so severe a sentence as he was about to do, but It appeared that they had fought for money, and this was a great aggravation of the offence. se then sentenced Groundwell to six, and Bubridge to two moaths' imprbsonmentand hard labour. NEW COURT. (Before MAr. Baron MARnT.I.) Henry Chennery surrendered to take his trial for embez. zlement. Mr. Robinson prosecuted and Mr. Sleigh defended. The prisoner had, it appeared been for many years the beadle and toll-collector of the boZoughnmarket, and some time in September, a deficiency being iound in his accounts of the tolls and rents colleoted, an Inquiry took placo, and it was then found that the prisoner had received several small sums of money, a portion only of which he had entered. For the defence it was contended that the entire amount received by the prisoner bad been paid in; but owiDg to the multplicity of business the various sums had not been individually entered, but in the gross amount. The prisoner was tried and AcqBuitted upon two lndictscents. A third one against him was postponed until next se£sion. Joseph Holder, 37, soldier, a genteelly-dressed manpleaded " Guilty" to an indictment charging him with em bezzling the sum of 1,1531. ]LsO, the property of our Lady the Oueen. Mr. EDwiN JAMES, Q.C., who appeared on behalt of the prisoner, said that he bad pleaded guilty to charges which could not be answered otherwise, and what he had to offer in mitigation upon his behalf was, that he had undertaken an office which was not suited to a man who was unacquainted with business, like the prisoner. His duties consisted in keeping a large system of accounts, which he was unable to do, and theyhad fallen into confusion, which had led to his present defalcations. From the fact of so many recruits enlisting and leaving, the accounts intrusted to the prisoner were too difficult for him to manage. Mr. BODKIN, who appeared for the prosecution, did not state any of the particulars to the Court. Mr. Baron MARTIN, in passing sentence, said that the prisoner had acted very properly in pleading guilty, but he could not agreo with the learned counsel as to the confusion in the accounts being the cause of the defalcations when ho saw the amount of them. It was most painful to have to pass sentence upon a man in prisoner's position, who had been a captain in the army. The fact of being plhed in his present situation was doubtless more keenly felt by him (prisoner) than would be any sentence which he (the Baron) could pass. It was no excuse to put forward that persons were unfit for the offices which they undertook. The poorer classes, who could ill afford it, were heavily tased to meet the expenses, and offences like these could not he passcd over slightlyh; and he felt it to e his duty to mark the present one with a sentence which to a man in prisoner's station would be felt severely, although it was a very lenient one, lie was then sentenced to 12 nionths' imprlsonment and hard labour. David Roden, 30, and David Day, 19, who had pleaded guilty to stealing letters, the property of the PostmasterGenera], were brought up and severally Eentenced to five years' penal servitude. Charles Stewart Mills, who had been convicted of utter mng a for ed order for the sum of 2501., was brought up and sentenced to six years' peial servitude. THIRD COURT. (Before the COmiMON SEnjAxTr.) Thomas Closs, a shabbily.attired man, wearing is beard and moustacche, surrendered to take his trial upon an indictment for misdemeanour, in obtaining fxom Henry Fitzpatrick certain bills to the value of 13CI. by false pretenoes, and also feloniously uttering a certai picture with a forged name, with intent to defra ud. Ir. Mletcallfe and Mr. Orridge prosecuted, tand MIr. Sleigh Mr. METCALFE, in opening the case to the jury, Faid that the facts he was about to lay before them would disclose a system of fraud which, although by no means new, was not very generally exposed, and therefore it became the more desirable that it should be put a stop to, and the pubHc would therefore be much indebted to the prosecttor for bringing forward the present prosecution. The learned counsel having briefly detailed the faots called Fredlerick Willham Adamis, of 9, King-street, Covent-garden, a pictureframe maker, who stated that upon the 24th of July the prisoner Closs, whom he had previously known, came to his shop and said he had a picture by Linnell for sale, and if witness would show it to Fitzpatrick he would buy it; witness asked if it was a genuine one, and prisoner said it was, and that he knew Fitzpatrick by skht, but not well enough to speak to him. Witness asked hitn if it wvs the same one he had seen at Smart's. Prisoner said, "Yes." Witness said if it was not genuine he would not have any. thing to do with it. Prisoner again sald it was gennrne, and as he (witness) was to see prosecutor, with whom he haddealing, uponthatdayinthecif- prisoner saidhsavottld send it round to his house in a case. Pris.ner told witnoss he was not to mention any names to Mr. Fit MAick, but say that the party who wanted to sell it was . --h pressed for money, and would sell it at a sacrifice. Tie picture was then sent to witness's house in a rou- can. The picture produced was the one. The prioe to be a"red for it was at first 1351., but Closs said he was to get 120i, When Fitzpatrick came it was shown to him, rnd the wi-. -w X he thouaght it was a largo price for vo small a ire. Prosecutor asked of the party who brought tbh icture whether It was the one he had seen at Snart?q ^ said, "Yes." Prcsecutor asked if he had acy ' ; s .- ' its being genuine, and took it up and rubbed * .c "Linnetl," which was upon ,P .e witness said a0 was not judge enough to say -fL.C' it was genuine, but from what he had heard suould say it was. Witness advised nrosecutor to go to Mr. Linneli and make inquiries about it, Sut he said it was too far, and he should miss the train. Witness told him to call upon Smart. Prosecutor then offered 1101. for the picture. Prosecutor then went away. During his absence witness saw prisoner, who said, "Get me 120C. for it, and I will give you 101." When the prose. cutor came bacl(he said it was ali right, it was the picture, and he would give 1301. for it, and gave witness the money in bills and checks, and told him before he gave up the money to get a warranty. This Closs said he would not do, saying he would sooner have given 51. than the matter should have been talked about, adding, "Fitzpatrick has been,to Smart's, who tells him the picture Is genuine, what does he want more ?1 Witness said, "As you say that, it is enough," and gave him the money. Cross-examined.-I gave Closs 1151., and when I found out the fraud I gave the 151. which I had to prosecutor. When prosecutor went away he said I was to get the warranty. Re-examined.-I have given every information in my power. I more than once asked Closs if the picture was genuine. When the fraud was discovered, Closs said it was I and not he who had sold the picture. The prosecutor, a carver and gilder, of Angel-street, Sheffield, deposed to having seen the original at Smart's shop, and Smart asked him 2001 for it. The witness then, in almost the same words as the previous witness, detailed the interview which had taken place between himself and Adams, and said that upon seeing Smart, he. said it was the same one. The two pictures were produced in court, and the copy, although coarse, was well calculated at first sight to pass for the original. It was stated to be worth about 61. By . SIGH.-Artistsreproduce theirownpictures. 'rn COM1MONG SEBJEANT.-They would atill be origials. We have in this country three orisinal Vandyke Charles 1. Mr. Linnell, the artist, of Redbhll, Surrey, said the original landscape with a group in the foreground was his painting. He painted it for MIr. Smart. It was begun at the close of the year 1856, and finisbed last February. He knew nothing of the copy (a laugh) or of t name upon it. It was an imitation of is. The other part of the case was that Closs had sold tbe original picture to a Mr. Lloyd. The copy most carefully adhered to the original in frame, canvass, and every minute particulAr. Mr. SLEIGH, at some length, dwelt upon the general character of picture transactions, and contended that it was not upon the faith of what the prisoner had said that the prosecutor had parted with his money, but from what he heard from others. He also contended that the counts relating to acommon fraud were not sustained by the evidence, no public wrong being shown. Thejury found the prisoner Guilty, and The Conox SERJENsT postponed the sentence to consider the point raised by Mr. Sleigh.

POLICE. MANSION-.oUSM--John Foley, who on the 23d ult. attended with a numerous body of his brother coalwhippers, aoccmpanled by the Rev. Mr Champneys. rector of Wbitechapel, and the Bev. Mr. Bowsell, of St. Peter's, Stepty, to request the intercession of the Lord Mayor with the coalownera upon their behalf, again appeaed before the L.O11D MYOR yesterday to learn the result of his Lordship's The LOBID MAYoR said, he wa3 sorry for the long delay which bad taken place in the matter, but which was owing to the absence from town of Mr. Chanipneys. According to his promise. he (the Lord Mayor) had applied for information upon the subject of the strike to Mr. Forster, chairman of the coalowners' committee, who had sent him a fn!l answer to the statements made by Mr. Champneys and Mr. Rowsell, and these statements were certainly at variance with the state of the case as furnisbed by Mr. Forster, whose letter hd been sent to Mr. Champneys, and also to Mr. RowselL The former gentleman could not attend, owing to his absence from town, and a letter sent by the latter was by no means In his (the Lord mayor's) opinion a satisfactory replg to Mlr. Forster. During his mayoralty he had always been anxious to prevent ex par-e statements fiom being made before him, and in the pyresent instance he fel he hddone wrongIn allowing Mr. Champneysand Mx. Roweli to make a public statement in the absence of Ir. Foley said, he should like to have a copy of Mr. Forster's letter. The LORD MAYOR told him he would no doubt see boeth letters in print next morning, as the press having published the statements made upon the part of the comlwhippers would no doubt publish the reply Foley then lett the court and the Lord Mayor handed the following letters to the reporters.

OARP2E asked the witness Humby if there was no policeman in sight during the part of the occurrence he had described, Witness.-Not for three or four minutes after I was knocked down. The witness Price said that the disturbance was going on 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour before any constable appeared. The sergeant in charge of the case (A 2) said there was always a constable or two on duty at the column. Price said that when a policeman did at last make his apgearance he did not come from the column, but from the direction of Northumberland-house. Foster, 593 A, said! he was on duty by the column and saw a crowd. He went to the spot and got there in about three minutes. He saw the prisoner swinging his belk but " did not see him strike any one in particular." Saw a woman there, hut did not see her swoon nor hear her say she had been struck. The boys said prisoner struck them. He said they assaulted him first, Prisoner.-I saw fonr boys interrupting a respectable man. I told them to leave off. One of them picked up somestonestothrowatme,andIhithim. Ididnotatrike any one with my belt, and I did not bite the man. MIr. JARDINE.-I take It to be in your favour that the boys do not appear. They may have assaulted or insulted you, as you say. You revenge that, according to the wit- nesses, with a great deal of kcking and violence. I shall not notce that, as they don't appear; but when you are interfered with by another person for what he thinks unreasonable niolence you do wFhat I nerer look over-vou get.his finger in your mouth and bite it. It is an un-Enlishh act, for which I fine you 4is., or 14 days' imprisonment. WESITMIXSTER.ThomM s Kefick, a middle-aged man was brought up in the custody of ?ociw-constable Page, B 147, on a warrant, charged before Mr. PATNTrR with Biolntly aaulting rs. Eliz Elliott, a married lady, residing ae No. Y4, Brmpton-creecent aDd with also uxing v ireateniDg language towards her mos to put her ln fear ot her life. ~ ~ ~ topu hrinN_~ The eomplainant, who while gving her evidenoe appeared to be stil sffering from the effects of the violent assault upon her, said that on the let of October she -was at home In the afternoen, when she was informed by one of her servants that the prisoner wanted to speak to her. She left her room to see him, when he Stated that he wanted to see his wife. She told him that she did not know where she was. He then abused her in very coarse language, and having done so he gave her a dreadful blovr on the right side of the head and knocked her down. She Eoon became insensible. Mr. PAYNTZE-Did you know the prisoner? Complainant.-Yes, Sir. He was married to a respectable young woman, who was obliged to leave him in consequence of his ill-treatment of her. He was in the House of Correctlon for injuring her, and he thought I know where she lived. By Mr. PAmNT.-I have no recollection how many times the prisoner struck me. After I received the blow I screamed loudly. Mr. Thomas Cahill, surgeon, Mchael's-place Bromoton, sLid that he was called to see complainant. We found her in the drawingroom, She was in a very shocking state. The front of her dress was covered with blood, and she was unable to give him an aceount of the aault upon her. He relieved her, and saw her again in the course of the n1ht. He found that she had received a severe blow under the right ear and also on her chest. The violence was so great that he feared she might have suffered serionusy. By Mr. PA.YNTR.-I.consider the assault very erious. I still attend upon the complainant. Eliza Mlleston and Eliabeth Woodcock, servants of the coiplainant, corroboratedthe evidence. The lAtter stated In a d9tion that Eh. heard the prisoner observe that he woulddo for her, and that he did not care if ho got 14 years for It. Page said that there was a person in the court who would state that the prisoner remarked 12 months ago that he would do for her. The landlord of the prisoner was examined, and observed that he had repeatedl theard the prisoner mgking threats towards her. He sdl that hw would mind sufferiig anything for her short of death. MIr. Eslliott wished, on account of the complainant's present state of health, that the prisoner shoald be dealt with summarily. The prisoner observed that he had no enmity towards the comp lnant, and all he wanted was his wife. r. PANTEs, remarked that it was a charge which might be very well sent before a jury, but, as the complainant might suffer seriously if she went before another court, he should attend to the request mado to him, and deal with the case summariy. The prisoner was sent for six months to the Hous of Correction, and he was held to bail In two sureties of 40L each to keep the peace for 12 months. Mrs. Eliabeth Cam pbell, aged 65, a ady of independent property, residing at Bloomhillcottage, oodford, Essex. and Elizbeth woolf, a servant out of place, wrere charged with having picked the pocket of Mfiss Anne Ramsay, 15, Sloane-terrace, Chelsea, of a portemonnaje, containin twro 101.>-nlote, three 6/.-notes, some gold, silver, and other Mrs. Campbell was defended by a solidtor, and a solic{tor also attended for the prosecutrix. Previous to the case beng gone into a request was made on the part of Mr Camp'ell that she might, with the other accused, be placed in front of the bar, when Mr. PAYNTm. observed that that there was no person before him. MIrs. Campbell, who was elegantly dressed, and who had a gold chain round her neck, was then, with her fellow-prisoner, put In the felons' dock. A statement was then made on the part of the prosecutrix by her solcitor, who observed that the position of his cient was one of a verr painful nature, and that she was desirous of not offendmg the feelings of the ldy aains whom the present charge was preferred, but that it was insisted that it should be carned on. Miss Ramsay had been to the Bank on Saturday for the purpoese of reeiving her dividend. Before reaching Sloane-square she took the portemonnai ontof her pocket to draw a shiing out of it, with which she p aid the conductor. At the end of her journey she mised her purse, in which were two 101. noteA, three Si. notes, some gold, si;ver, and other articles. She informed the conductor of it, and, acting upon the impulse of the moment, she charged the accused with the robbery, The conductor informed the coachman, who drove the omnibus to a police-station, where the charge was made against them, they being the only persons in the omnibus. When Miss Iamsay waz aware of tho respectability of the accused she expressed her desire to withdraw the charge, and the charge is now withdrawn. The solictor for Mrs. Campbell made an objection to tho withdrawal of the charge. He had been her professional adviser for the last 25 years. She was a lady of great r4spectability and esFed considerable property. She acutely felt the lncJnity of being charged as s e had been, And without any grounds being taken to a stationhouae, where she was stripped and searched. It was very necessary that some further notice should be taken of this matter, as two of her sons, who are in a very extensive way of business, had to be sent for for the purpose of bailing her. He (the solcitor) wished the fulleest Inquiry. Mr. PA"-smii.-Were they sitting near each other in the osnilbus? Solicitor.-No. One was at one end, ihe other at another end of the omnibus. They are not at all known to each other. Mrs. Campbell was never near t!e progecutrix, and there was not the slightest pretence for the charge. Mr. PAYTgRZ.-Tho charge Is disposed of by being withdrawn. It is a most unfortunxte affair for al parties. Any question anlsing out of it most probably will be disposed of elsewhere. With that I have nothing to do. If I had known the character of the charge I would not have placed the accused in the dock; but it was my duty to hear the charge as any other charge. The prisoners then left tho court. MALYLEJO.N_-A stylishly-dressed young Frenchwoman, who gave her name Ambrosine Le Blanc, was charged with having stolen watches jewelry, &c., to a considerable amount. Mr. Woutner attended for the prosecution; the prisoner had no_legal adviser. Mr. Wontner, at some length, stated the facts in connexion with the case, and the first witnes he called was Elizabeth Horsford, who deposed that she is a widow, having care of the lodge of Mr. Bishop South-villa, Regent's Park. In September last she was iduced, from a representation msde to her by M. Martin, a French Protestant clergyman, to allowvthe prisoner to lodge with her, and she remained with her til Friday, the 9th of October, no charge whatever having been made for her lodgin. Previously to the 9th she had told witness that she should stay till the nrzxt Monday, upon which day she alleged she would go into a situatioa as gover. ness. On the day first alluded to (Friday) witness went out shopping, leaving the prisoner to take care of the place during her absence, which she premised to do,; and on ner return in the course of an hour she found the front door locked, and on gaining admittanoe into the lodge she ascertained that the prisoner was not there. Upon examining the place she discovered that her bedroom door had been broken open, and that a gold watch, a gold chain, some earrings, articles of plate, &c., had been abstracted therefrom. U p on making further search other property was missed belonging to her nephew and another person named Parsons, the offlcer, stated that on the 12th of October he received information of the robbery, And after much diffioulty he succeeded ai tracing the prisoner, having prior to his doing so traversed a distance in various directions of not less than 50 miles. He found her at Rosedale-lodge, Richmond, where she was engaged as a governess, and he there saw the lady of the establalment-tv as *school. She calledthe prisoner into her room, having previously told witness, who had made known the purport of his visit, that she had taken the accused Into her service from a recommendation of IL Martin. Wikaess informed her (prisoner); that he was a police officer, and that he had come to take her into custody or a robbery at Mrs. llorsford's, when she replied that he was quite mistaken, and denied having any knowledge of the matter. He questioned her as to the gold watch and chain which she was wearing, and sho replied that they were her own. He searched her boxes, the keys of which she gave him, and in them were found a silver watch, some gold rings, 10 sovereigns, and other property. She had on her fingers two gold rings, which, with the other articles, she h2 stolen. The property recovered by Parsons was produced, and Identified by the several persons who hadi been robbed. After some further proceedings the prisoner was asked if she had anything to say, and the answer she made was that she should offer no defence at present, but if sent for trial sbe should apply to friends, who would see that she was not left unprotected. She was fully committed, and Mr. BROUGHTON spoke in terms highly commendato of the officer Parsons, and, addressing a sergeant of the I division who was present, requested that he would ma4e knowon what he had said in the officer's favour [to Superintendent Hughes. "E. L." has sentho Mr. Broughton 10s. for the Widow Lymin. An ackinowledgment in The Tims was requested. CLXRxsxNwrs1L.-Joscph Martin, describing himself as a railway contractor, aged 45, a miserably dressed person, of rather tall stature, residing at 45, Little Drummond-street, Euston-square, was brought up in the custody of Sergeant Hill, 39 S, charged with obtainmg several articles of ironmongery from. Mr. William Fowler, an ironmonger residing at 38, Skiner-street, Somers-town, under false pretence^, and also with having attempted to defraud numerous tradesmen of goods to the amount of several thousands of pounds. The case excited a great deal of interest, and the court was filled with persons whom the prisoner had endcavoured to defraud. For some time past the prisoner, who it was stated is well known as being connected with a notorious gang of swindlers, has been calling upon numerous tradesmen, and, representing that he is the working partner of two extensive slaveholders and planters in the Brazils, who are about to buUid a large city, has given orders to the extent of 1,0001. or 2,0001. In many cases he has taken away or has had sent to his resdence valuable samples of the goods, and the tradespeople have been put to the exense and trouble of drawing out invoices and sending them by post to the Brazils. When he gives the order, the prlsoner induces the tradesman to copy the following form, and to fiU1 up the blank with the amounts which the goods aro to come to:- "London, 1857.

Owing to his (the prisoner's)_good conduct they had made hinm a working partner. tho prisomner then said that Kes.n Harris and Ferdinand were about to erect a large city, and that they were engaged to build 13 extensive hotels. (Laughter.) He (the prisoner) had been rent over for the purpose of purchasing furnishing ironmongery. When I arkedh im forreferenocs hesid hehad powertodrawupon the UIon Bank of London ceCeks for betwen 6,0001. and 10,000. The prisoner then edected goods,and rve me an order tothe extent of l,6001, The samples thatV elected came to 7. 18s. The prisoner then told me to copy the order I had given him,and said that I oould have a cbeck for 200. on tl'e Union Bank the next day. When I told him that I could not let him have the amples without he paid for themi the prisoner aid, "Oh I we never pay for Bampleg I have the Famples sent to my house, and then I send them out." The prisoner, after Eome further remarks, went away, and I did not see him nn til the np.t dsy, vhen he said he had been to the bank and could not see the manager. The same day I communicated vvith tbe pollee, and on the next day, when the prisoner askd if I was Eatisfied with him, I Said " Several parties ham. been and said that you have called upon them, but I had my opinion of the matter." The prisoner then, seeing some lanterns upon the counter, said they were the sort of things that berequired, and after taking awzy one of them as wel as apepper-boxasked for some refreshment,and I gave him a shiling. When be left the shop he ws appre. bended by the police. I havig my doubt upon the matter previously to hislcallfng on that day. I oommunicated with Sergeant IllI, to whom I gave the prisoner into cus- the prisoner here said that it waa a cmse got up by the police and the tradsemen to ruin him. He was a man who could commnsd any amount of money. Mr. Frost, jmuL, oilman and colourman, of 22, Charlottestreet, Fitzroy-square, said, -In the latter end of Septem. ber or the beginning of October the prisoner called upon me, and, tating that he was a partner in a large farm In Brazil, ordered a quntity of goods, amounting in the aggregate to 4,341L 6e. Among the items selected were ap of various descriptions, to the extent of 1,0001,; pickles in bottles, 400.;, painters' brushes, 3001.- ;.nd numerons other articles, making up the above totaL fio also told mo that if he should be allowed to take away the bottles of pickles he could get me an order to serve a gentleman who was buying largely for the purpose of taking them out to Constantinople. ae directed me to send a copy of the Invoioe to the Brazils, and by the next post it was sent out. Sergeant EHIl 39 S, said he took the prisoner into custody, and Esid he was one of the gang that was sent from this court, and, being tried at the Old Bailey, he was een tenced to a lengthened term of imprisonment for obtaining money under false pretences. He had been to the Union Bank and found that no one named Martin, of the Brazils, had an account there. When he discovered tho prisoner'. residence he found his wife and children in a most deplorable state. The room had little or no furniture In it, and the children were almost naked. The wife told him that the prisoner had done no work for the lssfive years. Since that period he had been abroad for about ten months, and since his return he had pawned all that he had got to spport his family. The landlady also stated that numerons persons called every day, some respetably attired, and others in the dress of working peopie, swho complained of the prisoner having duped them under various pretences. Understanding that there were other cases, he hoped that li worship would grnt him a remand for the purpose of making further inquiries. Mr. CoRenn said he would grant a remand until Monday next. The prisoner asked to be admitted to bail. Mr. Cowst said that aS the prisoner represented himself as the owner of so large a number of slaves, he should require him to put in heavy:bail, which he had no doubt he could do. After some further remarks the worthy ma&strate aid he would accept bail two sureties in the sum of p0iso each. The prisoner was then removed,
SHtOCAIYG MURDER 2VEAR LIVERPaOt. LIVERPOOL, -Nov. 2. The quint village of Much WVoolton, about six nmiles fromi this town, was thrown into great excitement yesterday after noon by the announcem ent of a shecking tragedy which had h-een eracted in its midst. Andrew O'Brien, the 1%ndlord of extenslve spirit vaults known as " Tho Jolly Tar," at the corner of Hanover-street and Paradise-street, Liverpool, has for eoine time past been subject to fits of delirium fremens, and since Friday hehas beon staying with Mrs. Margaret Mulyneux, his wife's mother, wvho occupied lodgingsatthe house of a person named Moss, at Much Woolton. The licensed victoaller is an krishman, apparently albout 34 years of age On Sunday afternoon cries of " Oh ! dear" were heard to issue from Moss's house, and sounds were heard as of per. son s wrestling. Soo.- afterwards the bleeding body of M[rs. AUvlyneux was seen hanging partly out of one of the upper zoonm windows. The doors were burst open, and O'Brien was found in the house leaning over the dead body of his riother-in-law. He was this morning placed beforeithe c.unty magistrates at Woolton, Mr. Theodore Rathbonie presiding. He isa powerfully-bult man, with finely formed features, but low receding forehead. The first witness called was- Mary Moss, wife of a labourer (John Moss), who keeps the house at Much Woolton in which the deceased lived. Ste said the deceased occupied the front room upstairs, and generally enjoyed good bealth. The prisoner, her son-inlaw, was in the habit of visiting her, coming once a-montb, sometinier oftener. Sometimes he stayed all night, and was generally in liquor. On Friday evening last he came to the house with his wife. He was very drunk. His wife stayed with him until 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. On Sunday morning the deceased wanted to get the prisoner some spirits, eS she said he would not get his breakfast without them. Witness gave her about half-a-giU of whisky. She saw no more of the prisoner until 2 or o o'clock in the afternoon, when she left him in the house with his mother-in-law. Witness asked how Mr. O'Brien was then, and deceased said he was very comfortable, and was sitting in the asmchair. Witness and her husband returned about 4 o'clock in the afteruoon. Lucy Gore, sister-in-law of the deceased, said that In consequence of what she heard she went to the hc,ue of John Moss at 3 o'clock on Sunday afternoon. She found aU the doors fast. She knocked and heard a noise on the stairs like some person walking up two or three steps very heavily. After rapping at the front door a second time, she heard a heavy noise on tho floor of the room which the deceased occonir(l. The noise was like a heavy stamp with the foot on the floor. Ooivg to the window of the deceased's room, which looked into the garden, she found it open. She called " Mrs. Molyneux!" several times as loud as she could. No answer was given. She then returned and told her husband. Ellen Kaye, a neighbour, saidthat sho was going to chapel on Sunday afternoon, when in passing Mosa's house she heard a woman call " Oh ocar" several times. She crossed near to the house and still heard the same cry, but rather weaker. The noise came from the window looking into the garden. Sbe heard a noise of knocking also, as if two people were wrestling, and as if a person's head were knocked against the loor. She told what she had heard to a neighbour and then went on to a chapel. Margaret Collins, a neighbour, stated that she also heard noises in the house, like knocking and thumsping on the floor. Looking towards the window (above describedi she saw the deceased with her head and aria out of the winaow. Both head and arm were covered with blood. She went acrons to Mr. Atherton's house opposite, and when she returned the deceased was still hanging out of the window. Prisoner then came and li'ted the body in. It was motion. less. The police were then senat for. Richard Gore, brother of the deceased, and a shopkeeper at Woolton, went into the house with a number of others. and found the prisoner holding the deceased, and a great deal of blood on the landing. The deceased was dead and when questioned the prisoner said, "I h4ve done it." Witness corroborated previous statements as to theblood on the window-sil and the drnrken habits of the prisoner. The deceased, he said, had lent the pri3sner suone;. She lent him 5001. about a month ago, which witness believed had not been repaid. Some time ago the deceased tol.l witness that she would alter her will and leave her children share and share alike. She said she was sorry she had iot left Jobn as much as Mary. Mary is the prisoner's wife. The Rev. Charles Kershaw, Roman Catholic minister, said, about half-past 3 on Sunday afternoon he went to MOes'S house, forced open the front door, and saw the prisoner and the deceased in a room there. The deceased was crouched upon the floor, and the prisoner had hold of her or of her dress. She was covered with blood, and appeared to be dead. Witness knew the prisoner, whom he a generally found dsank or recovering from a fit of rdrunr.kenness. The prisoner, wben witness saw him, confessed that he had done it, and was quite calm. Robert Green, inspector of police, corroborated the statements of the other witnesses as to the demcanour of the prisoner when apprehended, and stated that the deceased was dead when he went there. On taking the prisoner to the station he asked him what he was there for, andthe prisoner said in a collected manner, "For the murder of Martha Molynetux." Mr. Johln Cross, s'rteon, and Mr. Gill, surgeon, stated that they had made a poest ortcm examination, and described injuries aboht the neck, wbich must have been caused by strangulation. The head was contused, and appeared to have been beaten against the wall or floorThere were three causes of death-concnssion of the brain, laceration of the windpipe, and strangulalion. They had examined the pnrsoner, whom they considered to be In a fit state to know what he was about. The prisoner, after being cautioned in the usual way, said, 'I shall make no statement more than that 1 did it under the influence that I was bound to do it. I was going about the ronm in a state I was never in before after drink, and I saw the pictures all round moving. I would lose uny life before I would take that woman's life, that same woman. She was the satne to rmo as my own mother and the only woman I had in this country; my own mother-inlaw in the public day." The prisoner was then committed for trial at South Lancashire assizes, to be held In Liverpool. The deceased was mother of the prisoner's second wife. Over his first wife an inquest was held in Liverpool about two years apo. It was shown on that occasion that after violent wor&s had passed between him and her upstairs she was found in a state of insensibility, and marks of violence were discovered upon her person. He stated bsfore the jury that his wife was addicted to drink; that on the day in question she was intoxicated; that while exasperated at her conduct he pushed her away and she feD heavily against the wall.

Sir,-Jn your impression of to-day there is a report of the proceedings which took place at the Manslon-house on Friday last upon the hearing of a summons obtained by Mr. Coleman against my client, Mr. Edwin Ward Jackson, for an alleged libel, in having written and published a certain letter defamatory of Mr. Coleman. In Mr. Coleman's evidence he stated that he believed the direction of the envelope as well as the writing inside were in my handwriting, which at the time I did not contradict as from the course Mr. Serjeant Parry intended to adopt t anticipated before the conclusion of the hearing to have the opportunity of denying that Imputation upon oath; Ps, however, the summons was dismissed, and it was understood the case was not to he reported until after the hearing of the summons Mr. Jackson is about to apply for against Ir. Coleman, It was not considered necessary I should notice the imputation until my examination on that occasion. The report, however, having appeared, I must beg of you to do me the jusice to insert this letter in your next impression. austicetoinse I am, Sir, your obedient servant, - R. 'P. JARVis, -, Ili ov. Z.
EDUCATION.I-t is shown by a return to tle House of Commons, made on the motion of Mr. Miles M.P., that the number of children in England and Wales who are now (orwere at thedateof thereturn)provided with education by aid afforded by the guardians to their parents, according to the provisions of the Act 18th and 19th Victoria, cap. 34 amounts to 5,353, and that the number of children V'hO have been relieved out of the workhouse, having been deserted by their parents, or being orphans have relief granted by the said guardians for educational purposes, amounts to 1,184. 'h total cost of the relief so grantcd by the guardians for the purposes of education in England and Wales amounts to 1,8281. The only counties in which any sunm worthy of nention is granted for this purpose are those of Lancashire, North asmber. rand, and the West Riding of Yorkshire. The other coon. ties figtre for sumus varying from 5s. 8d. and 7s. 6d. (in Glocester and Rutland), to 581. and 551. (in Somerset and Suffolk). In Middlesex, including all the densely populated districzs of the metropolis aud its suburbs, the sum of 281. wag granted. To this return is appended a copy of thePoor Law Board Circular to C'uardians of Unions and Parishes on the education of children in receipt of out-relef, dated the 9th of January, 1856. INTERESTLSG RELius.-The navvies employed on the first section of the Dorset Central Railway, extending from Wituborne to Blandford, on making a deep cutting in Castle.hill, on one side of the road leading through the village of Spettisbury, disinterred on Alonday, the 19th ult., a large quantity of hu7man bones, among which were as many as 70 skulls. The whole of the bon es were detached, autd when found preenteda erushed and broken appearance. In one of the skullg was diecovered a spear head firmly fixed, the shaft having been evidently broken off before the body was interred; various wDeapons of war, such as sword, daggers, spear heads, with orn.amental buckles and other fastenings for the dress, and a brass boiler-sbaped vessel, evidently used for culinary purposes, exhibiting superior workmanship, were found with the human remains. The probability is that the difturbed Inirialpiace was a large grave, in which the bodies of the slain were hurriedly and promiscuonsly deposited with the fssKnoents of the weapons of war they had used in the fight. So doubt can be entertained but that the spot where the remains were discovered formedpart, 1,600 or 1,700 years since, of a it 7mnan encampment, surrounded la earthen outworks, and -.,as probably occupied at the time the Romans advanced fr,'m che v-sstern coast into the heart of the country. The we.apon8 of war and other ancicnt'cnriosities found have been cloWpared wvith these of known' Roman character, and correspo.Ad in every essentl particnuar. The whole of the remains have bve*r carefally preserved by Mr. Davis, the contraclor of the railgvAy, who appears to feel muioh gratification in exhibiting them to those who are curious to es.'ese them, ~-Olerom huprual.
