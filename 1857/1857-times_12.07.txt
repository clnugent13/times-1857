The rates of purchase were pretty much the same as those which have ruled the marketable value of land for some few years past: The estates were situate in Mayo, Galway, Longford, and Corik counties. TH IRISH 2ODUCE-XMZ23. One of the Dublin Trade Reports of this morning gives the folloQwing rather gloomy account of the effeca of the recent commercial panic at thia side of the Cbannel:- " Our readers W.ll have seen by our commerclal notes during the lst three weeks that the altered state of money affais, the stringency which everywhere prevails as to dis. count, the large failures elsewhere. till gofrsg on, beginning in A-erica, passng through Great Britain, and. now reachlig the northern parts of Europe, have told on the 'rices of produce. Within tbis brief period thousands ave been reduced from affluence to poverty, toes of thouands of artisans thereby tbrown out of -esmployment, touchtng Ireland less tban elsewhere, but still the shocks are ever7where sensibly felt., The effect, so far, on farm pro. duee bas been to teduoe cattle and sheep 20 per cent. from October prices; pigs, 30 per cent. wheat, about 35; Indian coin, 25, and amost eveRI oiier article of breadstuffs propotionately. An exception exists in potatoes, probably rrom their failure (still pices do not rise), and in oats, now extensively required for oatmeal to make good contracts and for generause as well as feeding, without noticing what goes for distillation. Such an altered state of affaira has quite taken farmers and producers aback when in the act of preparing for payenets# Of .the haIE*year. All artioles are t*herefore necessarly pre3ed for sale towards the fall of the THE CATHOLIC UNVBSITY. A notice in the Roman Catholic jourmals announces that the collection towards the austaiument of Dr. Cullen's College in St. Stephen's-green will take place in the respeedtve churches of Dublin to-morrow, and on the following Sunday. Tomorrow's subscription lists at the chapel doors will go far towards showing the amount of sympathy felt in the progress of the new Alma Mater by the Roman Catholic laity of the Irish metropolis.

SEBROUS OHAROe. PRESTON, FRIDAY. Today Mr. Monk, surgeon, a borough and county magistrate, was brought up at the Town-hall in custody oa the charge of forging a wIIL The ease excited great interest and the court was crowded. Mr. Ascroft, the town cl:rk, and Mr. I. Sear, barrister, prosewuted; Mr. R. A. Cross, M.P., barnister, Instructed by Mr. W. B!ackhbrst, being for the defence. On Thursday a coroner's inquest was held, ariing out of the sAme matter. Ed. Turner, reedmaker St. Paul's-road, died on the 25th of September. During hil illness he wae attended by the prisoner. He died in a fortnight, and at his death it was found that the prisoner had succeeded to deceased's effects, which amounted to about 1001. after his debts were paid. The ramours which were circulated ledto the exhumaton of Turner's body at the cemetery, and to the transmission of the stomach nmtd intestines to Professor Taylor for examination. Professor Taylor's examinatioa is not yet finished. Theinquest on Thursday wasadjournedafter the evidence of Altce Chadwick, the housekeeper, had been given. That ovidence showed that deceased during his illness was attended by Mr. Monk, whoinanhourafterhispatient's death demanded the keys and removed money and books from the house. The man died on the Friday and Mr. Monk ordered the funeral for the Sunday, on which day he took some silver spoons away In his pocket. Subsequently he disposed of the stock in the workshop, and the household furniiture. The inquest was adjourned till the 11th inst. Immediately after the inauest Mr. Monk was taken lnto custod by the superintendent of the police, and lodged in To-day there were eight magistrates on the bench, Ir. Ainsworth being chairma. Mr. Segar briefly stated the facts, and expressed tno pain and embarrassment he felt in being engaged in the case. He called hMr. William H. Hinder, of the Consistory Court, Lan. caster, who produced the will alleged to have been forged. The Rev. Thomas Clark surrogate, add he remembered the 26th of September. the prisoner came to his house and said that a man named ner s dead, and money was wanted to pay hs workmen's wages; that he had been to the bank, and they declined to give him any without proper authority on his pert to receive it. He said there was no Will found, or words to that effect, and that there were no relations to deceased known nor likely to be heard of, and therefore letters of adminL&ration could be granted to him, as principal creditor. He further stated that he had had repeated conversations with the deceased, and knew exactly what he wanted to do with his money. The housekeeper was to have 5s. a-week paid to her as long as she lived. He aglied for letters of administration, and witness read him e following instruction which is given to surrogates :- No creditor can obtain admnaistration without first issuing a citation, and obtaining a decree Of Court." M.r. Monk thcn wished him to a pplyat Lancaster for that purpose. On the following Tu ay he came again, and witness told him he had an answer from Lancaster. The prisoner said no answer was requLired, as a will had been found. He pro. duced a will, and witnes administered the oath to the prisoner as sole surviving executor. [The will in question bequeathed 3s. a-week to the deceased's housekeeper, and the re=ainder of the effects to the dreoner. it was punctured in the margin, oontab.ed legal phraseology, and was dated FebruLary, 1855. Mr. Segar msid the ppero on which it was written was evidently the blank outside of a draught. It purportea to be signed by edward Turner, the deceased, James Holden, and Joseph Wilkinson., Witness state further that he afterwards received the probate fromn Lancaster, and gave it to the prisoner, who paid the chargS.

RWIJS TO THE EDITORO THRE TflIES. Sfr,-The newrprison and reformatory system has rcently beenattcke In ourcolmns,andthequestion caninot be It is eaia that the reformatory holdr out so auring Pect that the dscharged thief prefers it to work he mpight readilY get, though without a character, be he labour mechanlo. a That til he get such work the union eshirs place, therefore reformatories are, at least, aperflutous. That prisons and reformatories are comfortable enoUgh to turn honest men into thieves. Passing by the question 'whether labourers anid mechanics can always get wok and the idea, discouraging enough to honesty, that character ia of so brasl accOunt, is not the fact overlooked that discharged thieves are seldom labouren8 or mechanics? Their Occupation bas been thieving, and they can no more earn a lvelihood by honest work than a tailor can inake Ahce4a The object of the reformatory is to make them labourers or nmechanies, and When they have done so they arelurned ouit to got an honest living, and, odd as it may seem, they look forward eagerly to quitting their" "luxurious home,", and 'What is more they do not returnfto it, preferring possibly their independent ditnnr against a hedge, or in a stable," to the dining atnd drawilg rooms Panted by your corresondent "I. H. E.) This Is the gist of the wholo minter. !Under the old system the dischargedI prisoner almost always founce his way hack to prsn ne h nwoetetn dency Is deoidcdly the other' way Trae it is that those who devote themsalves to the work of reformtation are 13 I fA comPassionate disposition, whichmasm.

PURCHASE OF HOBSES FOR THE INDN SMVICE: nT AUsTArA.-Mr. John Oakes is at present in Goulburn purchasing horses suitable for service in Indi3. If the associaton.reeentlyformed In Sydney for aiding tha officer authorized by the Indian Government to select horses for the army have such active coadjutors as Mr. Oakes, the task of the gentleran expeted to arrive by the next mail steamer wiiU not be,a very difloult one. Jp to the presant time very few horses .have been offered to Mr. Oake3 in Goulburn, but in other pats. of the district he ha baen eminently E4ccessful aIn the extensive country between this and Bathurst. from offers ho has aledy received, he vill be enabled to purchase over two hundred horses-a very large proportion of the total number required from the entir colony. It is satisfactory to know that good horses are not so scarce in the district as some persons seem to imagine.

The mnis continue to run short time, and the demand for goods is very qIet. Stocks are undoubtedly on the increae in the hands of'both maufacturers and merchants, and generally goods may be purchased on lower terms. Confidence is becoming stronger among mercantile men, It being the opinion of most that the monetary crisis of the year is past, buLt all parties operate with caution, anxd purchases appear MOre than usurally limited. The cOndlit[on of the workin classe is far from being so bad as in some former paics, although in some of the masnufacturing vilages of thze neighbourhood It is said that there aremore hsandaut of work t- at any time duLring the pas 10 years.

Yarns and wools are without alteration either as to demand or price. BARNSLEY, DOc. 5. The linen trade in most branohes, bat especially for the products of hand-loom 'weaving, is dull; but the operatives are most of them partially employed, and they are 'tiding" over these bad tines inas good spirit. The coDiers of tEe district are well employed, and the demand for coal is ai good as could be expected. A- meeting of the creditors of Yessrs. Taylor and Son, linen-manufacturers, was held on Thursday at the Royal Hotel, in this town (Barnsley), and was numerously attended. Prom a statement of accounts prepared by lfr Hurd, of Leeds, it appeared that the liabilities of the firm were 18,8841 s 8d., and the vailable ssets somewhat under 4,000L A propoal to pay acimpoaition of 3s. in the pound was nade and seconded, and no opposition was offered The offer will be submitted for tue acceptance of the general body of the creditors. .

At the beginnlng of the present week there wero tho3e who were sanguine enough to imagine that trade was about to improve, and thAt we had at length seen " the beginning of the end" of the present severe depression. At any rate It wts thought there were some signs of improvenent inthe Bradford trade. The favourable news from Ind4 the better-condition of the money-market in London, and the receipt of some remittacs front the United States edcouraged this vew; but the utter prostration of credit at amburg, where produce houses of good standing have hea compelled to stop payments, has ca3St tJo the Old PoinAt.

If Egypt wa of vital importance to Romo, an one of the chief granarles of the city, the cotton of IndJA may hereafter. be hardly less essentil to us. How the Romans held Egypt through a governor ap. pointed directly by theo Emperorl and owning no reoponsibility to Any other anthorit' in the state. The colonize. tion of the country astctly forbidden. It mnay be doubtod if Roman citizenship was granted to any native. A member of the Macedont assembly at Aleandria was, by a special restriction, forbidden to liave a sext in the Roman senate. No Roman knight or senator was allowed -to visit the eountry without a special license, Ag for members of the blood-imperial, Tiberiia& views differed widely from those of Mr. Newman. We may presume,irom. the analogy even of other, provinces, that the Roman army of occupxtionr w renfored, not by native levies, but by recruits drawn from the moes distant quarters-fromBritatn, Spa, or Hungary-much as -if we were to hold Inda with a great Europem army supported b bands of Cafree, NeF Zealande s,~ Red Idians. The Roman goverument of Egypt was, in xhort, a permanent state of siege. I do not pretend to say that it is applicable to ourown case as conquerors of Ind1a, but it fi.as well that thereaders of lVzC T1nMea should not be led away by the false. analogy Mr. NeTman seems to have*srawn.

TO THE EDITOB oy rTH TIMES. Sir.-In Thd Timnes of Yesterday " Cast Away. writes on the subjeot of " iNorthern Lights," andl draws attention to the almost utter darkness In which the Firth of Forth is allowed to remain, instancing, s the fraits of such neglect, the loss of one of the finest steamers sailing from Granton, which occurrGd no later than last Saturday morning. I may corret an error into which he seems to have fallen, however-viz., that tho steamer Commodore, which strick on the Carr Rook shortly after the Marteollo, was following In the wake of that vessel, and not coming down the Firth.. This-only makes his ea stronger, as if they had been going in contrary directions the lights of the one might have misled the other, Vhereas nnder the circumstances such could not be the case, a steamer's lights not being visible behind, and consequently both vessels got on the rook for want. of a light to warn them away. The Martello Is a total wreck, the Commodore serionuly damaged. The Queen, a large steamer, was totally lost. within the ladt* 12 months - and within the last few years the Windsor Castle and the Mlars, all on the same rooks. These speak for themselves. The whole north side of the Forth, from Bnrntisland to Dundee, is In darkness; and on the south aide matters are worEe, for there is not a slngle light betweenr eith and Berwick-on-Tweed, There is seAely an eaterly ale that blows bXt leaves aid tokens of the dan ers of that ironbound coast. T'he many thouand valaabte lives engaged in carying on the very large and increasing trade of the Firth demana the attention of the Board, more especiilly it thewill not use their influence to have a proper and -efficient 4ystem of pilotge instltuted. I remain. &&. Ax OBSFRYER. Ehnburgh, Dec. 3.
TEIE QuxzN's TEXBDZE TO THE INDIAN SESLVIoES. -For onoo a Speech froma the Throne b a speech that realy touches tne nation. It Is neither a shadowy outline of party policy nor a dreary summary of proposed measures in which the peopln at large take little ihterest ; but refers almost entirely both to business that needs doing and to great achievements that have been done, and on which the mind of the nation is full to overflowing. It is a good promise for the session, even though it arise from severe calamity to the nation, that It begins because there is really something to do, and not because the ordinary time is oome. With real and responsible work pressing for com letion the House of Commons is always at its best. Our deliberative assemblies seldom deliberate to such good par. pose as when they have not the time to ddiberate too much. Lelsure may be very well for scientific investigation, but all experience shows that too much leisure does not improve the practcal judgment. A certain compression of thought, an instantaneousness of conception, a simultaneous grasp of'the different hearings of a great practical question, are promoted by the immediate urgency of necessity, and are seldom compensated for by the leisurely survey of all the ground. The stimulus to the mind of a direct pressure of work that must be done is a most needfulcorrective io that distraction of thought, that looseness of intellectualevew, that indecislve frigidity of judgment, which ample tlme for detailed exemilinahton of all the parts of a question tends to produce. We have a mtot striking Mustrafion of this in the great Indian achievements, for which the most important part of the Queen's Speech claims our well-deserved admiration When we compare what the Indian offlcers and civilians have actually effected, by presence of mind and prompt audacity in the most terrible position in which human beings could be placed, with the inefficient management of our Crimean campaign-though no one could say that greater courage or gallantry has been displayed in India than in the Crimea-the inference Is ablost inevitable that it is the disdpline of constant workandconstantresponsibility which makes Englishmen what they are, and that the practical sagacity and prompt efacdcncy of English character fade away in proportion as we rise out of the laborious classes Into the classes of leisure. The English army in the Crimea was managed and officered by a leisure clams. The few English troops in India were officered by men of the middle clss, and mena who, as a clvas, have had constant and responsible civil work to do ia the most tranquil times. We saw in the Crimea that raore pblnt courage nowhere existed than among our aristocracy. Bat while our Indian leaders and civilians have fully rivalled the aristooratio classes In courage, moral as weUl as pbyical, they have certainly far outstripped them ia wealthnof resource, il coastructlve sagacity, in rapid combinationa of the most daring and suacossful plans. As regards physical courage the intrepidity of Salkeld and Home were no doubt fully equalled at Balaklava and Il-ermann. But where could we nad any event in that history to match the moral Intrepidity of Lieutenant Osborne, sitting alone In his tent, overwhelmed by illness, far from any fellow-countrymen, and yet atill able to exert authority over the natives around him, and to overawe the mutineers who had the power to destroy him at any moment? Lookonly at the tlgour and skill displayed In anticipating the rising in Asem by a swoop on the centre of the conspiracy in spite of the vastly superior number of the conspirators; or at the defeace and relief of Arrah; or at the promptitude with which the forces, utterly exhausted, as we hear, by the tremendous labours of the storming of Delhi, rallied their strth to paus the hosts of flying mutineers, without allowing them even a momentary interval t recruit; or at tbe unaimnlty of purpose and inteligent alacrity iu combination that was shov*n by the English civilians and soldiers at Agra and Lucknow. Everywhere, from Sir John lAwrence and Sir Henry Havelock down to the young civilin who brought the treasure from Gya in triumph to Calcutta, wonderful presence of mid as well :as galantry has been the rule-not the exception. We ascribe this to the practical discipline which our servants in Iadia hbve derived both from their class habits and from their constant experience of practical emergencies in India. They are, as it were, trained to authoritative judgment amid the pressure and hurry of confusing details -and no habit i of mind is so valuable as this. We believe tat we owe the I preservation of India to our maiddle classes,-emphatically workiy men, not to an aristocracy. And the geauine strngtfih of every country will be found ultimately to del ped on the proporon of real workers to the population it oontins. The Queen's Speech will carry a true glow of sAisfaction to those services, both military and civil, for whom Her &Eajesty so cordially expressed her "warmest admiration," And well do they deserve it. We are sare that the House of Commons viUl remember in dealing with our Indian empire that, after all, it is neither to the Court of Directors nor the Board of Control that we can ever o we the actual pretervation of India, and that that system, therefore, must be the best which gives most play to the mattre judgment of Induias real governors and least cripplet their power by subdividing the superintending authority at home.-Economit.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMBI Sir,-An article in The Times of lAt Wednesday, headed "The Bishop of Exeter," relating to the Burial Board of St. Thomas, near Exeter, contatns a misstatement which I think you will permit me to correct. The article sayB. cThe cemetery adjoins the old chrchyard, anfi a mud wall ozmerl divided tbe two." This mud wrall the Buzal ZB down. "The Bishop, however, now refuses to -consecrate the cemsetery, unless the mud wa be restored." tt is rot true that the Bishop refused to conseata unlets he mud wall wrere restored.

The Bishop, therefore, "declined to consecrate the new ground, unless the old fence between it and the churchyard be restored, or a satisfactory fence he erected instevd."

LONDON, MO.NDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1857, The Gazette of last Friday contained a further issut of oficial despatches from our authorlties in India, but these documents are so erratic in their coure and so uncertain in the period of their appearance, that if we were left with no other mate. rials for constructing the story o. the war our task would be one of no amall difficulty. The group now before us commences with a report from General NICnOLSON, covering the whole interval between the 27th of June and the 19th of July. It terminates with an account of the second battle of Agza from the pen of General GRnATHED, so that I the intervening period might embrace all the chief operations of the war; but this space is occupied only by communications from Major Euru relating his proceedings after the relief of Arrah, others from Lieutenant HODsoN, detailing the gallant achievements of his Irregalar Horse, and a considerable roll of statistics from Sir Aion.- DALE WiLsoN'S Adjutant-General before Delhi. The I reader, indeed, wil probably remember that a former publication of these documents contained a narrative of General NIcHOLSON'S last exploit before the attack in which he fell, whereas the first of the operations which brought this energetic soldier before the notice of the public in this campaign in only now officially proclaimed. We take it, however, as it comes, and shall find quite enough in it to insure attention. The period of which General NIcHOISO1T speaks in this despatch was one of the most critical-in the whole struggle. It was the moment at which the disposition of the iunjab trembled in the balance, and upon this disposition the support of our force before Delhi, the success of the siege, and, in short, the fortune of the war, absolutely depended. It was not that the Sikhs themselves were otherwise than well affected, but the strength of the Sepoy garrisons in the province was so great that even the European force, though comparatively large, would have been insufficient, except in daringhands, to control them, and if mutiny onoe obtained the ascendancy the mass of revolters which could march upon Delbi and raise the country in their route would have left us without much hope, except that of reconquest with a neo army. To counteract designs of such extreme danger a moveable column was organized from the Punjab force, consisting of the 52d Light Infantry, some 200 Sikh auxiliaries, and a few light guns, the command being given to General NIcOOISON. With this column he succeeded in disarming the Sepoys at Phillour, and thus preserving the only arsenal from which our army could receive sup. plies of artilery and munitions after the seizure of Delbi. Having accomplished this important service he wheeled right about and retraced his steps to IJmnitsur, from which city, the ecclesiatical. capital of the Sikhs, he could command. Lahore, the political metropolis, on one side, god the Julllindur Doab, our first acquisition in these parts, on the other. Hardly had he occupied this position when the news of mutiny after mutiny came thick upon him. There was an obstinate revolt at Jhelum, and another at Sealk-ote, the intention of the rebels being evidently to pick up the garrisons of Noorpoor and Hosheyapoor, and then, push in one large body for Delhi. The first proceeding of General NIcHoLSoN, under these circumstances, was to disarm a regiment, the 59th Native Infantry, under his hand at the moment. But it deserves to be remarked, as showing how admirably even his iron rigour was tempered *ith justice, that he mrales a special report of this corps as well behaved, and probably innocent. " It had neither committed itself," he says, " in any way, nor do I believe that up to " the day it was disarmed it had any intention of "committing itself, and I may deeply regret that, even as a precautionary measure, it should have become my duty to disarm it. I beg very " strongly to recommend this corps, both as regards "officers and men, to the favourable consideration "of Government."

For the rest of his cbluiDh, however, iio - uch allowance was reAqiiired, and what with'the 01anmPle he made of .the mutineers upon the oRavee mand the energy of onr commanders at Pesha'wur,tha elements of revolt in the Punjab were effeotually Xtinguibhed. * There are two despatchez from the AssistantAdjutant-General of the Army before Delhi, which, though df a purely atatistiita charactei, deserve cope. cial notice. The first containi an official re.tpn of the killed and wounded in the operationn at Delhf and the vicinity up to the 31st of August; and the total, comprising natives as well a Europeans; amounts to 2,110 offlcers and men. To these' figures we are now enabled to add the muasaltie5' of the assault itself, represented by a ioss, in killed and wounded together, of 14lzO, so that 3,280 .soldiers were placed hors de combat before. Delhi was taken,-a larger number of men« than first commenced the siege under Sir HENry BAnrAn. Tho scond of the documents to which we refer gives an authentic m-uter-roll of the besieging 'force on the day last mentioned, and, as we know the amount and character of the reinforcements which came up on the 4th of September, we can thus form a good estimate of the army by which 12,000 or 15,000 desperate and disciplined fanatic, were driven from a city aRs trong as Bhurtpore. The Artillery ai4d Engineering departments were comparatively strong, numbering 1,535 in the former, and 941 in the latter, but this includes natives as well as Europeans, and, what is of still greater importance, the computation In this as well as the following instances embraces ick as well as effec. tives... Of European cavalry SirA_nucDA1Z Wn;soW had of all ranks 634, including 459 of the 9th Lancers, whose services throughout these operations have been eminently conspicuous. Of -European infantry he.had the 52d, 61st, and 75th, with the 1st aud 2d Bengal Fusileers almost entire -that is to say, mustering each, sik and whole together, between 600 and o00 men, and le had also 270 of the 8th Foot and six companies of the 60th :Rifles. Of the conduct of this latter corpi duiring the Indian contest it seems imponsible to speak m terms of too much praise. 'They have behaved themselves, as all accounts concur in representing, with most exemplary steadinews, intrepidity, and heroism; but at what a coBtmaybelearnt from the fact that the casualties in this detachment alone amounted to 2X3 officers and men kllIed and wounded, even before the assult of the city. With.the siege train, on the morning of the 4th, arrived the remainder of the 8th and two com-. panies of the 61st, to which succours were afterwards added 200 more of the 60th, so that the Euroepan infantry of the besieging army was probably at the laat about 4,500 strong. We need not enter afresh into details with which our readers have been so recently failiarized, but it will be instructive to observe the extent to which .General WnmoN was indebted for these meaus to tlie resources of the Punjab. Of the entire aMYy under the General's' command on thedAy of the assault, three 'full turopeau regiments, the 8th, the 62d, and the 61st, had been detached from the Punjab garrisons, and five out of the seven auxiliary corpe, including the Cashmere Contingent, had been raised and despatched from' the same province. We take no account of thb'e Artillery and Engineers, except to remark that Phillour supplied. the aiege-train; but, upon the whole, we may probably say, that at least fourfifths of Sir A. WmsoN's force reached him from the hands of Sir J. LAwnumCa and his colleagues. With the exception, indeed, of the garrison of Meerut, comprising the 60th Rifles ancd the Carabineers, and the 75th Foot and the Ghoorka Corps brought by General AxsoN from Simla. almost tne whole of the besieging army was sup - plied.by the energetlc administrator of the Punjab. Lord CANNMG himself has already borne honour. able testimony to these extraordinary services, and it will be strange indeed if the praises with which all India rewounds should not find a substantial echo at home.
The Committee for the Administration of the Indian Mutiny Relief Fund has very wisely arrived at the decision that the wives and families of soldiers who are simply serving in India with their regiments, and undergoing exposure to the ordinary easualties of war there, do not come within the pale of the Indian Mutiny Relief Fund. There can be no doubt that the suffering which the public intended to relieve by subscribing to that Fund was suffering caused by the Mutiny and the outrages eonnected with it. The war now going on in India is undoubtedly connected with the Indiau Mutiny, as having beencaused byit, andthese0oldiers are serving inthis war, but ordinary military serviea is not suffering, at least such suffering as thiseharity contemplates. These soldiers are no worse off than soldiers sent to the Cape to fight the Cafres, or sent to any other scene of war; on the contrary, they are better off, because they receive double pay in India, and can therefore afford so much more for the maintenance of their wives and families at home. A clause, indeed, added by the Committee to their original plan brings the wives and families of such soldiers within the pale of the charity, in case of the death of the men, but so long as they are alive and in receipt of pay their simple service in a war caused by the Indian Mutiny is very justly not considered to be suffering on account of the Mutiny, or to constitute a claim to the receipt of relief from this Fund. While we say this, we must remember that the wives and families of our soldiers left bRhind in this country in e of war are very proper objects of charity-of. chaity in general, though not cf this particular one. War is a tremendous anomaly, and the parent of anomalies. There cannot be a greater anomaly than this forcible severance of man and wife for years and years; and often for ever,-there cannot be a greater frustration of an apparent design of PRovIDENwE. These two are intended to live together, the union is the fundamental law of social life, upon the general preservation of which the whole syatem of the world is based; yet a necessity of State comes in, and, s5mply telling the man I 'I want you," carries him away thousands of miles, to return to his wife and family nobody cau tell when. Of course, this is one of the things that must be; there is no resisting necessity. It is, moreover, a severance which other causes besides war produce. Commerce is an unscrupulous separater of man and wife, and produces hundreds of thousands of distant husbands, who axe heard of _or from once or twice in the year. Here, again,. it is the simple word of command from. sopiety -from society in its commissariat cipicity, as discharging the duty of providing for itself -.ea: of thW of aelf-d4ence-i. is he-*hort formula-I'`I wnt youW' Wah the legend of t -masos ,x,, niy,th nm ePf to epabody thi- sad ' truth oftmilitary service, and did- this grotesquearmy of fermne bachelors' onli prest t,he 'n- happy forced bachelorship wlahchaocompaujes-andmnst alwaysacompany mlita&tilife ' It ir true in certain -moderate- degrees: thik severanloe of company between the tWo takes place in many departments of life.

That is to a certain degree a departure from her design. She did not contemplate a journey of 60 mailes at each end of the domestic day, with the whole day in London between. Shedidnotp!oture' to herself a husband getting more and more irritable ieryyday, from the constant wear and tear of railway travelling and the bad effect of the perpetuat' 3notion on the"!,rain, unable to bear, the. least noise when ho gets to his marine dra&wngroom, sending all the children out of the room immediately, and just tolerating thxe sound of his wife's voice, if it Is only very occasional, very gentle and soft, and communicating nothing-whic4 it requires the slightest exertion of mind to anwer. BuLt these voluntary repeated severances of master andl mistress are, of course, not to be compared to the long, forced, continuous separation of a soldier and his wife. When a lady who has a flourishing command of all the resources of comfort and luxury finds herself possessing in the midst of her social prosperity the solitary disadvantage of a quasi bachelor husband, she is apt often to submit to the chastisment with almost too calm and perfect a resignation. But it is a very different cem when an unfortunate vife with three or four children is left behind by a husband whom the chances of war have smmoned to the antipodes, to return when, if ever, nobody knowx. Unls ahe is so fortmate as to have relations willing and able to assist her-which is not often thoeae in that rankof life-she isleft alone in the world, depending oncasual remittances from the distant husband, of whose fate the is from day to day quite uncertain. It is, indeed, melancholy to think - how large a- proportion of these husbands will, by the certain laws of military casualties and climate, never returnagain. It was, perhas, natural in us in times of peace not to think cnuch of the trials of soldiers or of their wives. The life of the soldier was then only a life on parade and in barracks; it appeared, and it vfas then to some extent, a holyday life, with less to bear than befalls the ordinary labourer. But in time of war this scene undergoes a tremendous reversal, and. the drain upon this country necessary simply to keep up our Indian reinforcements only shows the certainty of that scale of loss-the los of life-which requires such replenishment. We canot think for a moment of such dreadful risks as these, -risk following risk, and demanding almost amnraculousgood luck to meet them,-without seeing that the exposure to them-and exposure to them in our defence-constitutes one of the strongest claims upon our generosity that any circumstances can give-a claim of which the families which are left behind are the natural representatives. Such a claim, though it has nothing to do with the Indian Mutiny Relief Fund, deserves serious local attention, and should elicit, and doubtless will elicit, the ready assistance of all neighbours who can afford to give it.
The history of. Lady E rxs &'s jewels is one of the strangest upon record, even in the prolific annals of London crime. Fzmnn, when at work upon the biography of JONATmA WILD the Great, might have hit upon a distant counterpart to this romantic incident in the chronicles of the hulks, but even his copious imagination wouldhave failed him had he attempted to sketch the more delicate details and finer shades of such a picture. The robbery of the Royal nuraery plate was a mere commonplace affair by the side of such a transaction as this. The abstraction of the golddust upon the South-Eastern was no doubt planned with wonderful ingenuity, followed up with remarkable perseverance, and effeeted with signal audacity, but it was altogether wanting in the rich comic vein which peculiarly diatinguishes the achievement of which we are now treating. There is no insuperable difficulty, to ba sure, in the removal of a box frown the top of a cxb. by three London thieves who are on the look out for anything that may turn up to their advantage. This box, however, was the property of a lady of high rank, and contained jewelry and dresses the value of which is probably understated at 15,0001. The fellows who had made this, enormoas coup wcre so entirely ignorant of the extent of their own good fortune that they nAstook the, diamon;ds for paste and the dresses for theatrical properties, aad accordingly disposed for a few shillings of wbat bad cost some thousands of pounds. They appear to have had prettymuch the same idea of therealnature of their booty as a mob of South Sea savages or a gang of drunken sailors might be supposed to have had under similar circumstances. The behaviour of Clown and Pantaloon in a Christmas pantomime, when their thievish efforts have been crowned with success, probably presents the nearest known counterpart to the proceedings of Messrs. WE}Ty, SAINT, and ATrrwFii wihn they were unpacking the result of their little expe. dition. We were enabled in our impression of Saturday to lay a correct version of the story before our readers as skethed by the master hand of one of the partners in the theft. If we recur to the transacMtion to-day it is not in the vain hope of rivalling the grephic description of a writer who might have extorted the applause of Drxox himself, but simply in the discharge of a usual duty. The robbery of Lady En.sutmens jewels is one of the most striking incidents of the day, and we are bound to' C3Ul attention to it, now that the mystery has ; received its solution. It is, however, but'bare m Inet riter in quest!ioti-1r. WnTTrAM AnrZLL--1o- ate, that -he has-related the ,progiess of, W transction ina s pirit ~irluich setsall eoompetitiowat defiauce. It,is got only-the Ihanxnne in ii e marshals bit incident. which commands our- admiration,. but the- rich. racy English in which his narrative i embalmed lil f:iar, beyond-.the ,reacJa . of any ordinary ule~teller. This gentleman has for some -time pat, resided in seclusiom at- Springfield Gaol, in the county of Eswx, and it is fiom thui pls of tumporary retirement that he dates the narrptive wbich we are now about briefl to recapitulate. On the 22d of Januar of Isst year Mr. AafwZLL, in company with his two friends, Meg.: SAM.and W-Nrrr, set but upon.a little excurs.onfom. Londori-bridg6: to - the West-end, to see' if anything.. couild: be! done in the line of their pe"uliar 'Irfessi6n. When mn .thp neighbourhood of Grosvenor-square 'they saw' a ;arilage drawn by two. horses, 'and immediately precedin'g it two cbs. 'On one of these waa placed a large black portmanteau, with a smaUer one .by its side. .r.l WTrY hereupon remarked "T herego Port St. Peters," which expressloi being interpreted, means "trunksi" The fiends were instantly-fired with -noble ardour. "May I " be lagged," . exclaimed kr. Wriny; full of noblieenthusiasm, but- III have the big one." - They, accordingly gave chase, and, Wrhen the carriage *and the two cabs parted company, Mr. Winr Jumped' up behind the vehicle which was the object of their especial pursuit, laid hold of the rail with one hand, and with the other dragged the big-portnanteau off into the road. It was so heavy that, we are told, Wmr, being then somewhat out of condition, fell with it. The horse im- the c-ab-so violent was the jerkreared up, but the driver was not " tum" bled," in other words, had not taken alarm. The three friends endured some moments of -intense anxiety as they watched to- ee if the two 'cheers," bir cabs, proceeded quietly on their way. They did so, and it was only discovered- at the railway terminus that Lady EarasbM=as jewel.- box, or rather. jewel-trunk, had apparently melted into empty air. Upon the consternation of the guardian valet, and of the cabman, and of the lady whose property had thus mysteriously disappeared, and of her maid, when the diappearance became known, we have no space to dwell. Probably the last supposition thatoccurred to any one was that so heavy a box had been quietlylifted from the top of the cab intheface of the passers-by who were there, and of the police wvho .should have been- there. This part of the story we-| maust leave to the imaginations of our readers.; nor can WO dwell. at -any length upon the ingeniou4 manner in which the trunk was conveyed to the shop of one Mr. EDWAvD JToxsoir, an oil and colourman in Leonard-street, Shoreditch,, aud. deposited under his counter, as though it had been forwarded to hin in the regular course of business. The confederates soon assembied in Mr. JAoMoles back parlour. They consisted of the three friends, Messrs. Wmmy, -ATrwnRn, and SAMT already named, and of Mr. and Mrs. JACKSON. To give an idea of what followed it will be proper to mention what was the real nature and what the value of the property which was soon to be tossed from hand to hand in the little back parlour of the Shoreditch oilhop. We take at random from the detailed account,-a pearl necklace, a diamond necklace, an emerald and diamond necklace, a pair of diamond earrings, a pair of emerald and diamond earings , a large pair of diamond branches, a snall pair of diamond branches, an emerald and diamond bracelet, and so onthroughout. Besidesthe jewelrythere were lace dresses, China shawls, velvet cloaks, Indian scarfis, and other articles such as might naturally be supposed to forma part of the wardrobe of Lady ELESMLsmR when on her way to Windsor Castle. The back parlour, then, in Leonard-street, Shoreditch, soon. presented the appearance of AT.A - DIN's Cave; but, like so many ignorant ArDnDIjs, the confederates conceived that the jewels were only so many bits of coloured glas or stone. Mr. ATTw=, indeed, appears to have had some dim suspicion of the reality, for, as he took up a diamnond coronet, he exclaimed, "Why, them tbings are " sparks I" meaning diamonds; but the better opinion among the party was, that the fire of the splendid jewels was a mere sham. Mrs. JACKsoN, who might be supposed to be better infolmed than her male companions as to such feminine mysteries, gave it as a suggestion, " That the lady who owned the articles " must be a kind of fashionable woman." But it was necessary to proceed to business, that is, to divide the spoil, and to convert it into money. WHIM sold a diamond butterfly which had fallen to his share for 2s. to Mrxs. JACAsoy, and also a lace shawl at the same figure. The real value of the article was about 501. Other smaller portions of the property were disposed of at similar prices, and in the same way. WHnrn, among his share of the spoil, obtained a pair of Lady ExrEsMIEB!s stays and linen, which " were all given by " him to a lady named 'PoLLY GXNTXMsAN."' The more serious discussion, however, was as to the value of the great bulk of the spoiL JTcrsobelieved the jewels to be worth about 401.-[he should have saia 14,0001.]; the others were completely in the dark upon the subject. They finally resolved to go and consult a man named SAs BrmoN, who seems to have been considered by them as a kind of authority upon such subjects, as to the dresses. To his house they were conducted by a gentleman named " CALrCC }"ORNIA ;" but, unfortunately, Mr. Btrrrow was not at home, and it was not until a later period of the evening that they were able to commence their negotiation. They asked 151. for Lady ELLSmE'S wardrobe, but Mr. S. BainMoN steadily refused to glve so exorbitant a sum, and finally closed with them for 31 . The jewels were disposed of for sums of the like amount, with the exception, perhaps, of the emerald and diamond necklace, which, according to JAcKSoqs account, was sold to a Jew for 3001. When 'the reward for the appreension of the thieves Was offered the confederas seem to have taken alarm, and many articles of great value were thrown away; lest they should lead to their detection. The emerald drop and diamond bow were thrown away in -Spitalfields, and a pair of diamond earrings-was flung into a field near Whitechspel. The gold articles were in great part melted down, and altogether it is to be feared tfhat there is but little chance that Lady ELLEsuIa wil recover any portion of her property. We are not, however, at the end of the inquiry yet, for WHrTTY and SAINT, two of the chief actors in the robbery, are still " wanted." On the whole, it may well be questioned if for many years past so strange a story has been brought under the notice of a London police magistrate as the fate of Lady Erxswsauues jewels.

The European requires repairs, which, it ix said, cannot be completed in a month. On the 2d of October the House of Assembly adjourned nmtll the 3d of November. The Parliament of Victoria meta onthe21st of November, and, deductingtwo months of 44ournuments, it has been in session more than eight months. The object of this adjournment is to enable the iAaIiVTOe'Counoil to dedl with the Bills pawsed by the As. nembly, and now before the Upper House. Ministers also promise during the month's recems to prepare the estimates for 1858, these for 1857 havlnk only been passed In the 9th eneath of the current year, after three-fourths of the ex- ernditure had become irrevocable. The Ministerial scheme aow Is, on reamssmbling of tho House to pass the Bills reurned by the Counvil,. then to prorogue the Legisature; -but to commence anew session almost immediately after, -so as to pas the estimates for 1858, and thus Itek into something Itke a constitutional shape the future practice of deal. -Ug with the public moneys. In future, it is said, the sese ,ion will be commenced in June, and It is hoped (the oolonial mind is especially sanguine) may be bzought to a con-clusion by the end of each year. For practical purposes this session may be considered as -abortive. The Governor's speech at the opening promised ,a batch of measures which every one at the time perceived -tould not possibly be carried. Ministers seem to have -une upon the principle of including every ponular measure promised by every Liberal candidate on the hustings, and -cramming it into the Governor's speech as a Ministerial ploaedge. Theeffect wasnodoubtsuccessflat the moment. It effectually took the wind out of the Opposition saUs. "See what % liberal progrramme Ministers give us; Oppoaltion candidatespromised no more, and Ministers cloarly *hAve more power to perform." These promises amounted -to at least 34 in number, including 15 distinct measure of iaw reform. Only 25 Acts have been passed, some of these teave been introduced by private members; some were not -contemplated among the 34 promise, and only five can be -deemod to have fulfilled previous pledges. The most im.Portant constitutional Bill ws that of Mr. Daffy to abolish ,the property qualification for members of the Lower House. It was opposed by Ministers, and carriod in spite of -Iaem. The Ministerial aevsl dc baraiZle was their land BIL 'The resolutions on which it wabs based were introduced by 4.he old Mnistry. The new Ministry, formed on the defeat of the O'Shanassy Mfinistry, is only distinguishable from -the old by pereonal ohangeq, except, perhaps, that the squattLng elemonto is stronger. The Bill was essentially a -squatting BilL Miniters say " No Y' to this, but though cer-tainlyfar short of what the squatters demanded in 1854-5, it must be doemed a measure favourable to them. They all in -the Iowrer House gave it their strenuoas support. It was -opposed by *U their old enemies, the anti-squatters. It pre-tended to put a partial end to their monopoly in two and &-half years, and a complet end thereto in five years. It -momlnally gave the Executive, strong in squatting members, -a great squatter for Treasurer, a great boot-morchant and -sortgagesof squatters for Trado Minister-power to resume 'ands. The public out of doorn, and the Opposition withln -the Hous, perceive that this power was not very likely to be exercised for the ptublo good-pozslbly not-at all: and, even if so, the clogs upon its exer-else wero such as to make it of little advantage -o the public. Iuvain the Argus denounced the Opposition ;aa facitous; the Opposition persevered, and the Ministerial imajority dwindled down. The minority could not succeed in detroying the objectionable features of the BiUl to any -cosiderable extent, but they instructed the country, til at daogth the comntry began to know more than their techers, .na to perceive that, taken in connexion with the original immigration Echeme and the preservation of small constita. -encies, the grand object was to raise up an taistooracy of the wealthy class, andto deprea the industrious classes by ren-dering the acquisition of land as difficult as posible to them. The immigration scheme proposed to Import 26,000 people; the distresses of the unemployed settled that schemae, and Athe.Council licked it out with contempt. " Thank God, we've a House of Lords I" At length the Land Bil went up -to the Council; petittons poured in praying its rejection. The Assembly had almost ignored the Upper House; 4once or twice it really forgot their existence. Mr. Fa'wkner opposed the Bill on publio gro:mds; -moreover he considered it did not make the squatters pay enough for the use of the grass. Mr. Cruirk --hank, a great squatter, opposed it because it made Athem pay too m uch. He had been in Eng'land since Maroh, and was not in the secret of the -squatters' strenuous support of the Bill in the Assembly; he looked only to the rent and assessments, and either did not 5ec or did not care for the latent effect of the Bill-namely, -to converr himx and his class into great colonial aristocrats. A day or two before the crisis arrived It was calculated that -the Bil mignt be thrown out by a majority of one or two; -to the surprise of every one, to the surprise of the House itself, it was rejected. " Thank God, we've a House of Lords l" was repeated with more earnestness than before. The Councll having its rejecting hand in has also thrown out the Bill tor abolishing State aid to rellgious denominations-a'uea. -sure on which a large portion of the population aro oold and indifferent, and the rest divided. One important measure now before the House is the Railway Bill, passed by the Assembly with lightning speed. 'The Assembly decided upon the mraking of two lines con. ,urrently; one, the Northern line, to pass through Castlemaine to Sandhurst, and ultimately to the Murray; the -other from Geelong to Ballarat. The cost of these two lines is estimated in round numbers at 8,000,0001., to be ralsed by debentures payable one-fourth here and three-fourths in London. Two of the newspapers, after havingeupported the scheme of two lines while the Bill was beforo the Lower House, now Advocate a single line from Melbourne to Ballarat, thence to Castlem nine, and thenoe to Sandhurst and the Murray. The cost wll be less by about 2,000,000L, but, as the line would pass through a very thinly populated -country as compared with the direct northern line, it would not pay so welL It cannot be anticipated what the CounciI -will do with this Bill, but I think it is not unlikely that the direct Northern line will be preserved at all events, and if the CoanDil make any alteration it wiiU be by limiting our first efforts to that one line. The unemployed turned out to he more numerous than -the Government anticip ted, or than the press 'would alow. A vote of 25,0001. was taken to give temporary employment to such as might apply. The applicants numbered about l,100. The employment 6iven was on cuttings and em. bankments connected with public works already decided on, so that the work 'wa not absolutely made for the workmen, -and the Government very wisely fied the rate of wages lower and the hours o T working rather longer than under private employers, Thus the men will not remain longer -than they can help. ln the meantime the great influx of people by sea has rather fallen off, aud last week the depar turee exceeded the arivals. The arrivals this year up to 'the 9th of October amount to 48;691 people of alLes, the -dea rtres during: the Fame period to 15,116, making the net increase 33,575. 1 estimate the average capacity of the -coantry to absorb population as equal to about 36,000 to -4,000 souls per annum-that is, provied they are ft for the colony. Many, however, continue to comre out for whose labour there is no demand-a defect In the mode of conducting emigration which I have often repreaented. The supply of gold continues to keep up. The four fortnightly esaort3 from Ararat have brought down 78,600 ounces. The production of that new goldfLeld is about 10,000 or 12,000 ounces per week, but the " rush" has been too great, and there are many not doing well. The supply laJt week by escort was 6,692 ounces from all perts. The imports from all parts up to the 3d of October amount to 11,722,9231.; the exports amount to 10,974,8901., the former being 748,0331. in exoess of the latter. This is by no means analarming difference, though it Is quite enough to create considerable stagnation of trado. Almost a11 English manufacturedarticlesare low in price, and I think sufficiently so to check consignments by those speculative houses at home which know bat little of the wants of this market, but have some sort of vague notion that a country which -ExporLts 12000,0004 of gold must be rich and reckles It is the consigning habit whieh has proved most detrimental to the trade of these colonies, and It should be discouraged. e'a, sugar, and coffee ar almost the only articles which are acarce and dear. - There is no sugar in the market, andmuch -of the tea is not of the kind in general demand.

There have been few changes in the import markets since the departure of the Emeu, the only movement of Iraportance being i4 sugars and Ieas, and generally in Eaern produce.

Several Fecond-olass brands have been in good demand, and have commanded betterprices. As the summner advances this department of busmess3promises to attract a fair share of attention. The only wines that have been much inquired after are claret and-light summer wines. " Bcsiness has presented more animation during the last month, as the diggings have been more rovpero". The success of the new rushes, the introduotiwn of Improved msechinery, and the larger supply of water have all cooperated to increase the means of the diggers; and propor. tionately to inmprove the poeition of storekeepere. HEnce larger orders are coming to town, and it is expected that as the season advances the-amonmt of loaiding seut up the country 'wilt steadily imfpve, itbelig 'well known thit for a long timee back stocks"bave been kept exceedingly low, and limited almost entirely to artioles of absolute -mce- Is GoLD. "The intelligence from the various goldtields during the last month has generally been of a favourable character Upon many of the older digging the want of 'water seriously impeded operations. But this want has been supplfed by the recent heavy rains. Hence the pud. dlers and crushers have been enabled to realize upon their accumulations of washing stuff. The mnore ex. tenaive introduction of eflicient machinery In connexion with the quartz reefs, which are every month being further developed, bas rendered sygematic mining a more certain and lucrative occupation than digging ; and the yield from this source is steadily increasdng. The new ruashes at Mount Ararat and Mount Pleaant have fuled the expectations formed of them at the commenceIent. Hundrcds, of course, have abandonedthe new ound indisappointment, but this is invariably the csue with a new rush; but a large populatlon remains bohind, who will in. all likelibhod be permanently employed upon thoze fields; and, judging by the suceessivo esorts ooming down, Ararat 'will continue to rank among our richest iggings. Deep oinking and quartz mining will no doubt in due time sueeed the mora primitive forms of gold seeking, which are alwvas at first adopted upon new ground, and the more sanguine predict that a second BPllasat will be eata. blished. Many zinor rus have taken place latey with more or lesssuccess; but the cry of a new goldfild has bseome a nmatter of such frequent occurrence that it now excites little attention, unless the attraction prcsented be sufficient to occasion the migratlon of 40,000 or 50 000 of the moveable population of our auriferous districts in the course of a feed weeks, as was the cse when Mount rarat was discovered.

"Victoria Is still receiving from the Old World more immigrants thban, in the present condition of our land system, wre caFn readily absorb. It is calculated that as least 30,000 have been added to our population during the pat year, and immigrants are stzll pouring In at the rate of 1,000 aweek. If the land question were settled on a legitimate ba this would be a source of real pleasure anDi profit to the country; but under existing circumstanoes the emigrnt, full of hoe and enthusiasm upon landing here, too frequently quail before the impediments catin the 'way of honest industry. " Since our last snumary, however, the condition of the people has somewhat Improved. The Government has provided temporary work for a large number of those who were on the verge of destitation, and others have been absorbed by private industrial enterprise. With the prospect of an abundant harvest the hopes of the people have been proportionately elevated, and we are disposa to congratulae ourselves upon having passed over the darkest phase of the commercial crisis. We shall always be subject to similar vsitations, however, until the existing monopolies and impediments to industry are swept away and our resOurCes as a nation are permitted a healthy development. "The antipathy between the white population of Victoria and the Chinese continued unabates. At the goldfields and elsewhere collisions occasionally occur, and Itis believed that there would be a general rising of the Europeans for the expulsion of the obnoxious race but for the prospect of speedy egislation upon tho subject. On tce 25th ult. MIr. flaines obtained the sanction of the House of Assembly to withdraw 'A Bill to provide for the reddence of the Chinese in Victoria.' The principle of the measure Is embodied in the following resolution:-' That it is expedient that every male native of Chinaor Its dependencios, or of any island in the Chine seas, and every person above the age of 12 years born of Chinese parents, should, on or before the first day of every month obtaila a license to reside In Victoria, ana should pay for tie same a sum of 11.' The measure has already pased a second reading, and in some shape it Is almost certain to become law, as the public are all but unanimous In desiring to puit a per Iinit to Chinese immigration. In the meantime, the clandestine immigration turough Gulehan Bay has considerably fallen off.X REVIEW OF TE1E MARKETS. (From the Melbourne Toui-al of Commerce of Oct. 15.) Our last special edition for transmission by the Overland Mail ws issued on the 16th of September, since which d&te we have continued without any more recent advices from England or the East until yesterday, when the Euroean arrived, full nine days after her contract time, the delay having arisen from defects in her machinery, which will require complete overhauling, and considerable doubt Is entertained of her being able to leave Sydney next month at the usual time. As the letters 'were only delivered late last evening It is as yet imposuble to say how the markets will be affected by the news, fn British products we do not expect much alteration, but Eastern produce seems likely to be influenced by it as inquiries for rice were active during the whole of yesterday. From Mauritius the accounts are rather unfavourable for holdersof sugars,andwemayexpectsomereactionrfromthe recent advance here. Tho detention of tho mall, although during the labt 10 days It has disarranged, has not serioasly affected business; and It is constdered that in the present state of our market the abeence of advioes, which it 'was generally thought would bring information of extremely heavy shipments, has acted rather beneficialy than otherWiny, enu nas muow-d a goodI many good tI oit conmp rtse,and hnas alwdago a gdstgoito consumption of 'hich puchases would have been probably curtailed if the extetnt of missions had been accorately known. The month which has elapsed since the despatch of the last mail has been chiefly marked byvery great stringency in the money-market, the baulns having seemingly come to the 'conclusion, or been forced to It by a scarcity of money, greatly to restrict, and, In a measure, entirely to stop, those discount facilities which they had been extending to houses of small means; as these measures were intended to force such parties to a cash system of btuiness, they mado little distinction as to the class of paper offered, and, indiscriminately tbrowing out good as well as bad paper, if held in weak hands, manyidle, injurioasrumo~rswerecurrentdttring the mouth, but for which not the least or remotest foundation existed, and which arose entirely from the abovementioned cause. It is wonderful how regularly, in spite of the scarity of money, all engagements have been met and the absience of failures, Inapiteofthesudden withdra'wd of accommodation, augurs an extremely healthy state of trade, an entire absenco of overtrading, and a sfficiency of capital in even the smallest business proportionate to the extent of its engagements. Few commercal communities could have passed tbrough an ordeal such as we have lately been subjected to with such ease and facility; and we believe that no other conclusion can be come to but that the trading community, as a body, is in an extremely pros. perous condition, possessing individually greater elasticity i and extent of resources than was imagined. as otherwise they could not have we-athered the late financial crisis as they have done; for we do not exaggerate facts when we state that but four weeks ago, for all purposes of meeting curnet habilities, neither goods nor bills were of negotiable value in the bands of small houses. The improvement of trade at the diggings, conmequent on a plentiful fall of rain and a return of the population from various rushes to their old localities, on an improved find of gold ii, *ld, and continued good success in new fields, - and on a general diminution of stocks, owing to the large quiatities fvrwarded to and consumed at neo rushes, has greatly conduced to relieve the pressure wich wouldother. wise have been felt in town; and it affords an adblonl guarantee of the l eillty of any aeriCouspinet of our.

: TH L;BVIATR". ' ;. i * . .1 7 . - Saturday was the worit day with regat& tothe progress of the ship -which has occurred ainoe-she irnt. commenced her.tedious journey, towardsathe water.. The men were all at.work by,8.in- :the Irorning, aud-with-the first. pressure the leviathan slipped dome eight or ten inches, but belonad hs, for some umaccountable remon, it was impodlble to raove- her., All the sorew jacks and vl 'the hydraulic machlnesO were worked simuhtneoealy, and strained to -the very utmost, and -mery expedient which . coiud induce a start rHesrted to, -but in vain. The aship remained as immovable as amoUtitairs throughout the .entire * day, -asd, .notl withstanding -the tremendous pressure-applied olong the entire surface of 'both her cradles, it wa peat 4 o?.clock before another slip took place. This hitch doubtlessarose from two sources-first, thatthe fore patt of the vesEel hnd desceftdeamany inches further tbsnjthe stern, and so twisted the cradles in-the vays as5 to require double; thfy amount- of presur to overcome their friction, and, secondly,^ that sthe vEsselitself is nowatfeast 600feet fromthestrongest of the hydraulic rams,-and thIndistance necessitates so many joints in the beams which push from--them ,to her that the force of the machines is-eithek,lost in the compression of the wood, or, *hen that is overcome, that the beisu thomselves give way laterally. The- latter occurred often- on Sa.turday, and in the delay occasionetd in r efixDg the beams the greater psrV of thel'cday was lost. This contrdemps -was the maore t6 be regretted as thee wax an -unusal- mumben of atenltifid and distinguished visitors in the yard on Saturday, and during the early part of the day Mr. Brunel - and Mt: Yate' hid the honour of receiving no less illustrious a vitor than the Princea Royal herself. Her ' PRoal Highne is, attended, y bthe Duchess of Atho, Mr. O=rsby Gore, and: an :querry. in Waiting, went over the eatireayard, andall the ponderous apparatus for lowering"the largest mnssand greatestweight that has everyet been moved were duly pointed but, and their action explained. Her Royal Eighness seemed much struck by the immensity of the drulm and breaks, anithe hundreds of tons of massive chain cables which were wound around them. The enormous solidity-and strength of the -bases required to resist the backward strain of the hydraulic jresaes- seemed also to amaze her Royal Highness, who examined and inquired into every detail,,. .inspecting the hydraulic machines, the construction of the cradles, and the double purchase, which, work;ing from the- land to the moored barger, drag the vessel tovwards the river. As we have ~ld, while the Princess remained it was anfortunately impossible to move the vessel; but this loss was almost compeusated by all the apparatus for moving her bei ng quite at rest, and ao enabling. ihes to approach it nearly, which, of course, had it been in action, and with a full strain upon allits great system of bea.ns and chains, neither Mr.Yates nor AIr.Brunel would have aUowedforfear of dahger. Her Royal flighneac quitted the yard shortly bfore 1 o'clock. As we have said, it was past 4 before -any movement was made upon the ship, when the pressure applied was to great that' Ithe " yield" could be distinctly felt upon the whole series of timbers which support the ranas. After this she moved with more or less difficulty in thorb slips and with rather tedious intervals between; so that at dusk the iggnal boards only thowed a pro. greEs of 88 inches forward and 72 inches aft, her mean being 6 feet 8 inches. Daring yesterday no attempts were made, but in order that no further lots of time might be'occasioned the " rams" were advanced nearerto the ship. The efforts will be resumed to-day, and with all the advantages-which the change of machinea-will afford great proBrea uaely to be made. Trotnan' anchors appear- to -have got hold of the uentre of gravity; for, in spite of the severe stri upon them, up to the present they have not yielded an inch.

It would not be emy to surpa te & JDnsidiownjl in the grote-que manner In which it handlesEug. lish topics. The ludicrous e orn us with which it expoeod the seventies of the pasport sytem in England Ia not yet ceased to msme the public. We have to-day another xpecimen of the sort of knowledge which, with Te rare excetions, French journalists have of our habits ad indtitutions. The Pays equals, if it does not surpass, In prlmitlve inno. cence its twin brother, the onstuionidWemrm genus, par nobile fratrunm You have brought down ita thunderbolts on your head by your aricl on the simultaneous opening of the 1French and English Parliments. You have only yourself to blame for the attack made on you this day by the Pays, and for the terrible consequences of the announcement that its opinion of you and of English instiuons -is very mo-so indeed. M. Vitu, the writer of the .article, tells you that you have no oommunity of idea whatever with the public you address; that you have forgotten, when drawing the contrast between the British Parliament and the Legislative Body, one most important point-to wit, that the Utter is " elected by universl xufrsage-that is to may, by the entire nation, without any condition of qualificatlon; andthat the former Is namedbya small number of electors, whose liberty or independence noone will dare to make a boast of." HIerefers you for statistical and other informatlon on your own House of Commons to a certain M. Iegoyt, who, we are told, writes in theBRevue Contemporaine. On this authority, no doubt, the Pays informs you tat " in France the ballot is absolutely secret, and that in England the elector gives his vote in writing I -and under the surveillance of the man who pays The Pays affiins that the Emperors delegates (by courtsey called the representatives of the peop)e) are very remarkable men indeed :-" The LeslaUve Body is an assemblage of men as distinguihed as cm be desired for the happines and glory of the country which has chosen them." This may be the *aese. There was a time when France was more hard to be pleased. According to the Pays, a very little thing now goes a great way with her. G-reat Britain is very much mistaken Indeed If she hatters herself that JL Vltu has any high opinion of her Parliamentary system. "With the exception of 10 or 12 menwho can speak, or who are . acquainted with public business, there are hundreds of members of Parliament who are utterly unknown out of their countiea, and who have no other title to recommend them than being the brothers, sons, or nephews of a Peer of the United Kingdom." Then there are not so many men sSdecorated in the French Chamber as you may suppose; It Is well known that the Legion of Honour has never been bestowed in France except " as the highest recomnpense of military courage and of civil merit" The lglative Body is consequently an asemblage of the greatest warriors, orators, and statesmen of the age. Besides, supposing for argument's take, that they are not the hero and sages every one knows them to be, there are not, -after all, so many decorated as you think. Out of 260 persons in the late Chamber there were only 199 with bits of red riband. The number is so amall it is not worth speaking of. This I take to be a hint that It would be as well to leave no buttonhole -unadorned, and the Emperor should hasten to put his red mark on the whole, instead of on part, of his flock, as quiddam notum propriumque. The manner in which you have presumed to disparage Count de Mormy's parts of speech, and to nake light of his elocution, excites in a remarkable manner the indignation of the Pays. It is clear you are unable to appreciate true oratory. "cce Times," cries M. Vitu, " is not pleased with his Excellency Count de Morny's original and energetic *elcuence, which always calls forth such lively syma=7mhes," &c. It is beyond a doubt that his " Excellency" comes out now and then very strongly, but It was not until now supposed that hi. powers lay in Parliamentary eloqueuce. M. Vitu thinks that France ought to be very well ratis.fied with her internal condltion, and never more so than when she looks at other eountrles with which The Times b well %equanted; but M Vita generously forbears to pan you too much by more clearly indicating the country he has in his eye. You are told that you have excited "c Mto,IsMhent mingled with indignation" on the part of the whole of the English prem byyour criticism on the Imperial institutions. But your most terrible pniiunhment is resrved for tho last. Mbf. Vitu declares that you have brought on yourself-not to speak of his own thunder-the wrath of two of your contemporarle* the Morning Post and the Moritng Chronicl"e- who have shown that between the English public and the extravagant declamations of The Times there is no 4olidarity." Notwithstanding the desperate condition to which you are thus reduced, M. Vitu, en boa Prince, hopes that you will repent of your offences; and, though he gives no pledge to that effect, yet one can see that repentance would give you a title to his indulgence, and, perhaps, pardon. The Emperor, who is pretty woll acquainted with England, and who loves his joke like any mere mortal, must laugh very heartily when he reads such things. I am just Informed that the Presse of this evening has been seized by order of the authoritiesanother of the advantages which French institutions have over English. At the period when the mutiny commenced among the Sepoys in India the nuns of the order of Jesus Marie of Lyons had a branch establishment at Sealkot, on the frontiers of the Ponjab. The community at Lyons had no news from their sisters for several months. They have at length received a letter of an old date (29th July), from which I take the following extracts: "Ver dear and good Mother,-On the 8th of the present month the native soldiers heard they were to be disarmed the following day. They became furious, and searetly Planned a revolt. They carried their plans into execation at an early hour 03 the following morning. We were immediately apprised of It, and I hastened to awake our poor children, and all of us, half-elad, prayed for shelter at a Hindoo habitation. Some vehicles nad been prepared foi us to escape, when the servants desired us to oonceal ourselves, as the Sepoy were ooming Into the garden. We returned to our hidlng-place, the soldiers arrived, they took away our carries, and a shok was fired into the house where ve rere concealed. The baU pased clode to where our chaplain was sitting, and slightly wounded a child In the leg. At the same moment three soldiers, well armed, presented themselves at the door. The good father, holding the holysarament, whichxhe never quitted, advanced to meet them. Several of us accompanied hm.' Wehaveorders to kiQlyou,'aaidtheSepoys. 'butwo wil spare yoa If you glve us money. Go ouot all, thait we may aee there are no men concealed here.' Having searched and fouud nothing, one of the soldiers raised his sabre over the chaplain, and cried out ' You shall die.' ' Meroy, in the name of God I' exclaimed LI ' I wil open every press to ahow you thas there as no money concealed here.' He followed me, and,having satisfed himself that there was no money, the soldiers went away, We tbenibroke a hole In the Wall of our garden, and fiedinto the jungle. We had sarcely escped when 30 more Sepoys entered the house, but the Almighty preserved us fr6m this danger. We were crossing the country, when a faithful servant brought us to a house where several Europeans had taken refuge. We breathed freely there for a moment, but the Govermment treasure wa s deposited there, and 'the honse was soon attacked by the mutinouts Sepoys. We believed that our last hour wras athnd,but the savages wrere too much occupied wilth pillge to notice us, and the Eu^ropesm escaped. at this momoent a Cathdollo sol,dier offered to guAivd,us to the fort, \ ] ,_ _ sr * vo not know howr lone Twhe receipts of the Parit aed Orns oflerans hay Oompany for the week en8ding the2t o=e 1trea8df. us with the cograrend and atenopondang wTe receipts of the Paristand ore aila January to the 25th of November amaount to 52,400,810f. 6c., being an Increae of 56,65.

SATURDAY, Dzo.5. The Tmperial Court of Algiers was crowded to excem on Friday, the 27th ult., with persons of all ranks, anxious toee Captain Doineau, who obtained ce unwnviable a notoriety in the affair of the A:rab Chief who was murdered at the gate of Tlemeen. Captain Doineau was agsin brought before the public, to hear the lmperial letter read by which the sentence of death pronounced on him Is com. muted into perpetual imprisonment. When IDoineau was introduced to the Court on this occalon he wa no longer attired in the brilliant uniform -whicol so well set off his martial figure. The spe*tors who had thus seen hin could scarcely recognize the man who, surrounded by Gendarmes, wore the prison dreas composed of a cotton jacketwith blue and white stripes, and trousers of orse linen, holding a cloth cap in his hand. He fixed his eyes on the Court, and asumed the sgne attitude as during his trial. Captivity, however, had subdued his former bold bearing and inaction had produced corpulency. He listened without emotion to the decree by whieh his life wasaved. When theientence was registered, Doineau addraesed the President in the following words-" Paion, Monsieur Ze PreSulent, J'autrais qu$ques mots 4 vow adree."

The latest advices from Sweden mention that " His Majesty the King continues to take his daily drives, and It is observed with great joy that His Majesty's state of health continues to improve in spite of the oolder temperature that has set in." Precisely the same words might serve for a report on the Ying of PruiBa's health. He continues to drive out and to 'walk in the grounds of Charlottenburg every day, and very evidently gains in bodiy strength. He receives the visits of various members of the Royal famnily, and oonverses freely with his adjutants, chamberlains, and other officers of the Court; he manifeats also very distinct recollections and perceptions With regard to his building arangements; and even rentured yesterday to drive into town for the first time since his illness, after having the day before also inspected some improvements that have lately been thrown open to the publio outide the town. This attainment of a comparatively restored stte of bodily health is, however, as yet unaccompanied by a parallel and equal restoration of the mental powers ; the :ng's present state, probably, Is quite on a per with that of most men of his age after a severe fit of illneos, but offers very little prospect of such a restoration of his mental powers as shall admit of a resumption of his regal functions at the expiration of the th"ee months, or, lndeed of a year. In Prussia, in con sequence of the hZghly centralized organization of the State, the King has not only to keep himelf cognizant of,and have adecisivevoioe In, all momentous questions of policy and statecraft, but also to give his coneent and authenticate it wlth the sign manual whenever an officer of the army applies for leave to get married, or a new street has to be namcd, or new buildings have to be erected, or a charitable institution desires to take possession of a legacy, &c., and a hundred other petty matters of administrative detail, which fritter away the strength of the strongest man. From Copenhagen we learn by telegraph that the Danish Minister of Finance had made over to the National Bank of that place the sum of 1,500,000 rixdollars, to be advanced to the commercial world by way of loan on seurities of wkCeurs or goods. The National Bank had at the same time raised its rate of discount for bills from six to seven per Cent. By the same opportunity we are informed that itwas intended in Copenhagen that if a moratorium, or perlod of grace, should be resolved on in Hamburg with respect to firms momentarily incapacitated from meeting thelr engagements to have the same measure introduced also into the sister town of Altona. The Idea of the said moratorium, however, although it has been mentioned in certain telegraphic communications from Hamburg, appears not to have been actually entertained there, or, at any rate, has not been realized as yet. The Senate has introduced a slight adinistrative alteration into the practice observed in the winding up of houses that have suspended, but has rejected the proposal made to it at the same time for certain deviations fromthe general law of Germany affecting bilLs of exchange. There is as yet nothing fresh to note in the state of commercial matters here, but the rapid succession of the most depressing Intelligence from HIamburg leaves little hope but that there will soon be bad news to report from here also. The few houses that have as yet fallen here had no European standing, and are in no way connected with the great cosmopolite family of bankers. The detals of the Hamburg news you will doubtless have received direct thence more fully and more correctly than I can send it to you from here. Yesterday evening Piccolomini and Giuglini gave a second operatio representation, and this time to a full house, the critiques of the morning papers havlng been very favourable on the performances of the Monday evening previous. Musica criticism is carried here to such a pitch of perfection by men who dedicate themselves to the study as a profession that the great bulk of the people are totaUy without independent judgment in the matter, and follow the lead of the favourite critic with all the docile, gregarious feeling, of sheep following the bell-wether. Fortunately for the impresario's pure and the fame of the arti3tes the verdict was favourable, and the house was filled. All the Royal family now in Berlin, including the Prince and Princess of Prussia, who were not present on the former occasion, honoured the Italian singers with their countenance and liberal applause. Plccolomini and Giuglini were both on this and the former occasion repeatedly encored and called for at the close.

I ntimaated in my last communication that there was a probability of the hereditary burgesses being called together forthwith to receive further proposals from the Senate relative to the present crisis. The great number of insolvencies, both here and at Altona, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, amnounting to uipwards of 40, hastened the determninationof the Senate to execute theirdesignWithout delay. The object invie*was the renewal of theBankrupt Law of 1799.

(wsox ou owm OoD5roxDRx,3) ONSTANIop, v.2. By an Imperil ordinance Ist'Week thO pay of the: subaltern officers in the amy has been aumen ted. The lieutenants, whose py has beein hitherto 180' plsatera, or, aocording to the prent rate of exchange, about It. &a, are to rceive henceforth 250 ; the first lieutenant's pay has been increased from; 250. piaters, or li. 14%s to 3W piuters or 2t. 7,; and that of the captain fror a59 to 450, or about -3l sterling, a-month. Beides t h the firt reeives two, the seond three, and the third four rations, which as theymay be taken inrmoaney, adds rb,ontoetiri.w more to their pay. This increase of pay,s lght ras It Is, -Wa very much wanted, for there exists, perhap no more miserable position thai that of a subaltern officer in the Turilsh army. There is a common mag in. the army that " man begins with the major,' and a very true saying it is, for that rank is the Rubicon, and that passeda, advanoement becomes. comp.atively easy. The subaltern officers wre not officers. according to our European-notlon, they are more In the position of non-comzissloned offlcers Any one accustomed to Eurdpean srmies would be not a little surprised on visiting the~ commander of - a bat talion to have his pipe filled or lit by the first captain. Aoording to the rules, thek subalter officers should be supplied by the militry wchools after having received their professional education ; but this is, like many other-things, a rule OUn4paer.- From the first moment a youth enters the school, the idea is impressed upon him by daily experience that the road to advanoement is not merit, but favour. His firt care is, therefore, not. to acquire the rudiment. of his profesion, bu. sorse Infuential protector. He either succeeds ornot.- If hesucceedshe is kept as an able youth, -and having completed lis time, Is attached to the persona of hisprotector and beoomes apart as itwere, of his household, sharing the vicistudes of his mgater_ If he cannot ingratiate himself wifth some peson in power he is after a year or two sent to one of the regiments, where he sinks down soon to the level of his brother subalte officr, who perhaps three months before worked at -the plough. It is the men who have re fron the ranks who form the great majority of the subaitqrns. As the pay is not very brilliant, and as there is no advancement, except in extrordinary cases,, It is often difficult to find menwilling to accept the t. The firat idea of the recrlt in entering the tar service is to quit It alas soon aspeeible,but if he accepts the place of a subaltern, or even of a noncommisaioned officer, he has most probably to re. main all his life in the army. Only last yea, when the old soldiers, having completed theirtime, were discharged, the subalten officers gave in their resignations en masse, and gentle force was required to retain them. As it was, 1 in many regmenta recruib had to be takento supply the vacancies. While this lIthe poition of the subalterns the pay of a Muahir or commander of a corps Is 12,0001. a-year, that of a lieutenant-general 2,800K tht of * major-generall,200L,of acolonel800. pfalleutenint. colonel4001.,and of a major comnia ings battalion 1801.a-year. Now,observethegradatlonsbetween! the general officers and thefield of ers. This isong to a former increase In the pay of the first, whilcll at once became three times as much as It had been, while that of the field officers received a sal addition only, and that of the subalterns remained the ame. The measure was devised by the present Seraskler, who at that time was all powerful, and anxious to gain popularity among the leaders of the army. It is this break in the hierarchy of the army which is in a great measure the cause of its ine6icieney and which is in the way of every improvement. There are, as it were, two classes, or rather castes of officers, the badly-paid for work, and the well-paid ones for ornament-the firt taken from the ranks, the latter picked up anyw'here, but invariably good-looling,-the fist chiefly remarkable in times of war, the latter in tlmes of peace. As the Palaces of the Sultan on the Bosphorus, so does the ornamental part of the army augment daily. The army regulations fix, indeed, the number of general and field officer, but whoever has protection can easily get attached to one of the numerolus military councils in Constantinople, and the result is that the number of unattached auperfor officers is far larger than of those who are attached to the army. The pay of the former is rather larger, for, while the officers with the army get the equivalent of their rations according to the price of providons in the provinces, those who are at the Seraskierat at Stamboul receive the high prices of provisions in the capital. They are thus near to the fountain of Ma honour, have nothing to do, and can always find occaion for a little job. It is therefore the greatest difficulty to induce superior officers to leave this place, and even if they are named they always find excuses for not going. Although there are at least four of five times as many general officers as the army requires, there is always at least one-half absent of those who ought to be with it. The centre of the ornamental offlcers lithe office of Etat Major, where you can see them lounging and smoking, fawning, and alsaming, whie there is not a spot in the whole empire which has been regularly surveyed. If the Turks cannot do without such ornaments, they ought at least to divide them all over their territory to make maps and surveys. The young officers coming from the schools would thus have an opportunity of improving themselves, while under the present system I do not believe that there are half a dozen who could make the simplest topographic sketch, It is with a view to remove the discontent reigning among the subaltern officers that the increase in their pay has taken place. But, as usual, the mea. sure was perverted before it came into life. You are aware that all officers, superior as well as subaltern, receive a certain number of rations besides their pay; and the iame enormous difference exists in this respect as with regard to everything else. Thus the Mushir has 128, the IUebtenantGeneral 64, the Major-General 32 ratMons, and so forth. Now, a general officer, whatever be his bulk, can never eat 128 or even 32 ratlons; the original measure was therefore to take away the rations from al those officers who are not attached to the army, but pacing thepavement of Stamboul, and employ the sum thus economized to improve the pay of the subaltern. Suoh a measure would have been in more than one rspet excellent. It would have provided for the necessity of increasing the pay of the subalterix without becoming an extra charge to the Treasury; it would have contributed to Induce office to seek active service, instead of idleness; and it would have put an end to one of the most shameful jobbingo in the administration. There is a special office for the administration of the rations, which has to fix the prices to ba paid for the rations due and not consumed; the current prices form the bads of the estimation, but, as there is no control, the prices, especially in winter when provisions are dear, are always much lower than In the market. On this is basd a scandalous trade; the officers are paid low prices xn bonds,wbich they have to discountwith 30 to40 per cent. loss toprivileged sharpers, andthe provisions are sold in themarket byrmiddlemen.TheAdmirhtration is supposed to buy its supplies at a fixed price In the country, but, instead of doing this,tley confiscateth3 supplies w hich come to the capital, and thus in reality regulate the prices. For instanlce, at this pro-. sent moment, owing to the gales, the ships could not come in with wood and charcoal, and te Administration takes advantage of thi to speculate. Every vesselisseizedwhich comes in, and the price thus enhanced for the profit of the mlitary adnistration.

We shoad have supposed that the knowledge of such an atto-ipt baving beon made by the home authorities wo*be sufficient to Induce those in whom power is vested here to act, and that so soon as prastuble after the arrival of the corps in question it wou'd have been despatc'ced to India. Indeed, commononso appears to point so definitely towards the duty demanded, more especially when it is considered that steamers were sent from Bombay to Mamuitius and the Cape to dillect tr=oo, that even the excuse which we find in the many. h ed proxy ofhis xcellenywiscarcelyaountforthe torpidity displayed. The Simla, which could have takn the whole regiment as far as Po}nt do Gale, en rout to Calcutta, has been allowed to sail without It; and as we write she is half way to Port Phillip, where the City of Sydneys mail wll overtake her, and afford such an explanation of this busines as mav enable tlhose most interested to render no honour where blame is due, But though the Simla takes no troops to asdst our IndiAn brethren, she conveys them an account of the review of two entir e. ments and a battery of atillery held in the domain on the afternoou of Friday last, as It were to mock their very necesgties. There ts no reason why either one or the other of the fine regiments there parded and now lying idly-and we venture to assert impatlently-in garrison here should not be increased by volunteers from the one Lftto 1,000 bayonets, and sent with that all-permave in. strument in their hands to take a part in the all-imporhnt topic of the discussion of Britain's supremacy in India.

From the particulars which have at present trarspired it appears that on Thursday last the deceased and a twin sister were playing together near the fireplace in the kitchen of their fater's house, their mother being at the time at the back door washing. While engaged in this way, William, the elder brother cf the decessed, a boy nine years of age, took up a loaded gUn, whlch had been incautiously leftb his father in the corner of the kitchen, and from some at present unexplained cause the n w lac harza and the contents entered the hack of tie head of the esed oerc the right ear, and, from the siz of the wound, It is supposed the muzzle of the gun must have been nearly close to the head of the unfortunate child. The other child, on the mother running into the houso, was found uninured; and was on the top of the deceased, innocently looking at the wound in her sister's head. ImmedIately upon seeing what be had done the boy ran away, and up to last evening (Fri. day) had not been found, although it has been ascertained that he slept in the bulding the same night.

VIaCE.OHANELLORS' OOURTS, Dza. 5. __ _ BRAhwDLlXG Z. pr.Thr-wD tnort Vwe*UAanjdlO. Site Rx T. .MX M".l whis WaS A petition presented by the assgDtesof a mortgage debt secured by a judgment, prA yin that tbey mghethv benefit ofcertain trust dae lwhich they were ed to execute under these clruit&Uces --ft appeared t at on the 31st of December, 835, a certain deed wsexecuted by the son of t'harles John Brandling,whereby the whole of hi3 eshtes were vted in four trwees for the benefit of his creditors, and A time ws -fixed within which Iny creditor might come ID; but there ws &n abs lute discretion vesed in such trtees as to the time within whichereditors should be allowed to come in and execute. The petitioners were mortgagees by a n zneht fromRob&rt4, Curtis, and Co., of a mortgagemfr 21,000L,who had never executed the deed, but took a cognovit, upon 'which iudgment was entered up, and registered in October, 1835. Tis suit insttuted by xn smmultant claiming under the deed, seeking a ule of the estates, and the crrying but ofthe ttuas of the indenttre of December, 1855. Certin proceedings took place ,n that suit, and a sale and inquiry were direcVd. The cause came to a hearing, when it was discovered that by some error in the docket of the judgment it war' Invalid. That decison was appealed from to the Lords Justioes, and Lord Justice Tmrner coln. ciding with his Honour'g opini6iI that decidon was afTirmed. Under these circumstances, notWithstanding the length of time which had elapsed, the petitioner, having rested upon their judgment as paramount to the deed, and never executed the deed, nor applid to the trseem to be allowed to do so, now aeked as above to be allowed the benefit of its providons, beigwillng to execute. Mr. Anderson sad fr. Basch appeared in an port of the petition; Mr. B1ly, 31r. Glasse, BatesMr. r. Eieelng, Mr. li'ckAenson, h. ToUer, Mr. W. D. Lewi, Mr. Schomberg, and Mr. Forskr appeared for the other arties. The Visc-CRcAnxLLon (without calling upon the respondents) said that the queston was what was the l effect of the trust deed, irrespective of any equity, arng eot of the speial eircumstanoes ? It wa clear that on the exprese words of the deed, if any creditor did not come in within the time specified, he was excluded, unless the trutees thought fit to allow him to do so at a future time. Prtrid facie the plain rule of the Court ws that where it was discretionary, if the trustees were willing to exercise such discretion, the Court would not interfere. The equity here allege was thisx:-The petitioners having advisedly abeAined from exe. cuting this deed, it must be assurmed for the very good reason of the paramount nature of their securtlty of which they would have availed themselves if the trustees had not paid their interest, claimed before theMaster, and a petition was preented to be paid out of the 7prpduoe of the aes, which they were clearly entitled to if this judgment was valid. Unluckily itturned outnotto be so, and his Honour, with great regret, w&s oblged so to decide upon a mere techmcality, and that decision was affirmed. Meantime 20 years had elapsed, and the petitioners had not only abstained from executing, hut had never applied to the trustees for the Purpose of being alowedtodo so. This petition wAs then presented, and the question was whether the Court could make an adverse order against al the other parties claiming the benefit of she deed. Ilis Honour did not decide this case on the onnd of non-application to the trustees, although hewould not say that such fact would not be sufficent to refu the petition; but, looking at it fairly, and supposing such anull. cation made, and that the trustees had refused, hadhey acted corruptly or unfairly in so doing? It could not be a that they had ; there was not the least trace om t Where a party adversely elected for 22 years to let a matter go on, and then came for indulgence upon the equity of the discovery of snch a blot as the invalidity of the judgment, that was not such a case as would induce the Court to interfere. The cases on this subject did not touch the queation, and as, if the application had beeen grauted, it must have been upon the terms of paying the costs, it must be refused with cosin. (Before Vi(CJhanceUo Si J. TFTUART.) RAMLAOGH V. LrrHOW. This was a petition by the defendant for thew.yment out Of court of a sum of money, which by the decree in the cause had been paid in as an indemnity fund to the plaintiffs against certain judgments which had been obtained in actions by creditors against the official manager of the Royal British Banlk, and which judgments had been r tered against the defendant, who was a shareholder in the bank. Thebill was filed forthe specific performance of an agreement for the sale by the defendant to the plaintiffs of certain lands for the sum of 1,8001. Subsequeatly to that agreement the before-mentioned judgments were registered against the defendant, and by the decree which was made on the hearing it ws directed that the agreement should be specificaly performed, and that. on executlon of the conveyance, the plaintiffs should pay 900Q. to the defendz ant, retoin 100L. for costs, and pay 800OI. into court as an indemnity in respect oF the above judgments. On an applica tion to one of the judges of the courts of common law at cha^mbers, an order had been made to strie these judg. ments out of the register as affecting the lands of the de- eri.

As their judgments had been strack out of the register, their rights were no other than those of the ordinary creditors of the defendant. There would be an order as prayed for payment of the fund in court to the defendant. (Before VioE-CroLOR Sir W. P. WOOD.) WZLLSLXY V. TnH E IRL OF MOORNNGTON. A question arose upon this petition of some importance in referenoe to the Iriah Encumbered Estates Act (Ilth and 12th of Victoria, cap. 48).

These esttes, whilch had become greatly encumbered, were sold in the Irish Encumbered Estates Court, upon the petition of the present Earl of Mornington, who had become an encum= nce upon the life interest of his father.

He knew nothing o machinery, but purchased the Invention from }Er. How.. The model on which the patent wu obtained wa so in complete that to support his specifcLation he was obliged to construct what was, in fact a new maclne Another was aftrwards oonstruted, and only then three were -ever made according to the patent. Theplaintiff's witnees hd stated the specification wan sufficiet to enable any work. man to construct a machine which would answer all the purposes set out by the plalntiff;it woula be shown dis. tinctly that such was not the case if it wau, bow did it happen that no machine had ever ieen nYed for any pur. pose but sewing leather, coarsmaterifor stays?

The ounger bankrupt, 27 years of age, examined, denied that be had any idea of his father's insolvency when he joined him in partnership in 18-7. He had shortly before the bankruptcy borrowed money from various female Herfants atjtbe westend. Some of the money he got from the firm he gave to a lm Marrlott. He thought it was in Trevor-square, Knightsbridge, that he last saw Mrs. Marriott. She was the widow of Captain M arriott, and he had givhe her several sums of money. He was now married to a lAd7 from the country. A cabman named Kingston had not been. ia the habit of driving himself skad Mrs. Marriott about. He knew the Pits Head publichouse, and had driven a lady there. The CosmissioNmR said, he had heard quite enough on hs head. It wag clear in respect to the manner in which the younger bankmrpt had disposed of his drawings. I was urged in opposition that the conduct of the elder baukrupt had been most culpable as a father, and fraudulent to others, and that of the son most profligate; and that, as egarded their accounts, they were nothing better than " a conglomeration of ideal facts." It was absurd to suppse that the younger bankrupt could have driven about Iu cabs and kept the company of ladies at a cost of only 501. per year. His HoKouR said the trading had been very disrputable. The father was deficient to the extent of 6291. in 1853, when he induced the son to join him in partnership. The son could not, however, be regarded as in his leadingTerings. He was described aa a very clever young man, and ought to have known the errors of the course that was bein pursuei The expenLditure of 3,9101. against profits 1,412. had been unjuatifiable, and the borrowing of money from widows and female servatnts was most eensurable. The manner in which life policies had been dealt with by the elder bankrupt was highly fraudulent, and the son's co'bdtct had not been honest The result was that there wer, debts to the amount of 4,0001., the tsets be oly about as many hundreds. The certifioate of the elderbank. rupt must be altogether refused. Some distinction might be made as rarded the younger bankrupt. He would reeive a thirdlass certificate after three years' suspension, the first six months being without protection. The certificates of arrest would be withheld three vveeks to give the bankrupta an opportunitb of appeal.

There was also another charge of a sinsilar nature against Mr. William Watson, of the New. lngton Arms, King-street, Walwrorth. Mr. Solomon attended en behalf of Mr. Watson. Mlr. Coars asked Stowell vhich case he intended to proreed with first ? Stowell replied that he should prefer giving evidence against Mr. Bingham In the first instance,ashehadsworn that he was never his clerk. He (Stowell) could prove otherwise by competent witnesses. He was then sworn, and he stated, -My name is Thomas Stowell. I was tried and senteniced to 12 month' imprisonment at the Surrey Sessions on the 17th of November, 1856, for obtaining money under false pretences from Mrs. Penny. the landlady of the Newington Arms publichouse, King-street, Walworth. Mr. Bingham on that day swore that I was never his clerk. I begged to have my care adiourned, as I could produce evidence to show that I was his clerk. In August, 1856, £ had an office in Kennington-Iane, near the polioe conrt. Mr. Bingham's name was in the window. One day in that month Mr. Fisher, a soicitor, was In the office when a client came in and gave me Instructions, at the same time asking me what my fee was. I said I was only clerk to Mr. Binuham, and that he was in the inner room. Mr. Bingham heard that, and he said, " Pay my clerk Mr. StowelL" Ireceived the money and entered It. I cannot recollect the name of the person, or the exact amount received. I gave a receipt for it, and I think Mr. Bingham saw me receive it. Mr. COMBrOS.-NVat is the other transaction ?

This is the summoning officer at the Southwark Police-court." Guest said sometlitig, and Mfr. Binghasm told him, " If you recommend us business we'll make it worth your while." Cross-examined by Mr. Bingham.-I live in Darhamstreet, Kennington-lane. I was introduced to you at the Elephant and Calle, when you said, what business I brought you we should share. I was to be your clerl, receive instructions and money. After that you caled at my house, and we entered into arrangements, and that evening you employed me as your clerk. Tho terms were that as oun were very poor I should have half the fees. I told you I had a good introduction at Lambeth Police Court, and could get'plenty of business.

WZITR ASrZES. ROMXE CIRCmU. MAIDSTONE, DEC. 4. (Before Mr. Tvuae WrLEs.) Chare HolloWAy, 23, a& rspectable-looking young man, was indicted for forging and uttering a navy bill for 461., with intent to defraud. Mr. F. J. Smiith and Mr. Deman. oonducted the proseon. tion on.- behalf of the Admhraltr. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Bibton. This was a prostion instituted by the Admiralty. The prisoner, it appeared, ws formerly seamen'sschoolmaster on board- one of Her Maljeaty's ships etilled the Preident, and he aed in that capacity durig a period of nedy five years while that vessel was on6hekacifie station. Under a particular statuto the offioers 'on board. a Government vessel employed on such a seivice are allowed the privileg of drawing their pay byblapon t,he Accountant-General of the Navy in -ondon, which bills ae generally discounted by the merchants at the different towns' at which the vmel puts in, and then transmitted' to London, wherethey are paid in the saW conrso, if they were found to . be corrct, and the -prisoner fromn hispositon on board the vessel was, of course, well awre of the! manner in which business of this nture was tranwsated, -and ala. had an opportunity of obtaining possesin of one of the blank forms of bilithat were kept-n board the vesel forthe purpowe. The captain of the President was a gentlemannamed Fzederick, and the first liettenant was named Mtn and -itr was for forgery with refereno to the names of thoe gentlemen tht the present chatwas preferred Against the prisoner.. It asp pared that the President arnivd..in Bogland at the end of June, and was-paid offat Chatham ijhortly afterwards &ad on.the lf,h of August the prinnervprementedhimself at the Chatham braneh of the London, and Cotnty Bank, And handed to the cashier what appeed to be a navy, bill for the sum mentioned in theindl"atj drawn by Lieuenant Morgan in favour of a on named William Butler and asked himtocas'hit 'heclerkVut-somequestions to the prisoner, in answer to which he stated that his name Was Willism Butler, and that he was the peon in whosefavour the bill was drawn. He w then-to3lthat the.bill us be sent to London to asoerain if It -were agenuine ilstrument, and that he must lesve it for that purpose- but'ha, obOted to do so, and'the clerk then sid that if he was known in' Chatham, and he could get any respeable p raonto t bisname at the back'of the Hill, he waould cashit for The prisoner upon this leftthe bank and,went-tothe-shop of Mr. Marlk, an outfitter and contractor at Chaths, ana urodced the bill, and stteodthAt he had been,recomrmended shim by the London and County Bank, and asked -hIm. t cash the -bill, staig that he 'ould. take * pat of the amount la- clothes, a,nd that he did not Want all the money, but that ,portion would be saufficient for his present purpose. o at this time stated that he was steward of the Chesapeake, which vessel was then fitting out at Chathamn and Mr. Marks having aertained that this Wa not -the fact, his suspicions were excited, and he was about to send fors policeman, when the prisoner, who had- evidently become alarmed, endeavoured to make his escape and foroed hisa way out of the shop, ran off, and endeavoared to make his escape, Mr. Marks followed him, oalling " Stop thief, ' and he wAc arrested when he had gone- -short distanoe, and given into the custody of Mr. Everest, the superintendent of the Chatham police, and he then begged Mr. Marks to forgive him what he had done on acconat of his family. Mr. RTor took some ingenious tecbhical objections to the indictment, and contended that the Instrument, umder the pcar formin which it was drawn, did not come withinthetermsofthestauteasabill of exchange.. They were, however overruled by tho.Court.- The le&sueA counsel then addressed the jury for the prisonerand said that the answer ho was instructed to make to the charge was that the priaoner ead disoounted the bil in questionfor another person, and thathe was innocent of any knowledge that It wasafrdulent instrument. The jury, after a short deliberation, found the prisoner Guilty of uttering the bill knowifng it o be forged, and he ws slentenced to slx years' penal servitude. Frederick John Bushell, 27, a powerf4l determined-look. ing young man, was indicted for the capital offence of wounding Rosnna Bushell, with intent to marder her. The Indictment also contained the usal minor counts of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and to maim and disable. Mr. iibton pronecuted; the prisoner was deendod by Mr. clerk. Posnna Bushel, the proecutrix, a very good-loolkng young woman, deposed that the prisoner was .her husb and they lived at the time of this oocurrenoe in Hartley street, Dover. On Sanday, the 27th of September, aheand the prisoner were at home together, and nothing particular. ocecured during the day, and they weat to bed about halfl pat 8 o'clock. The prisoner shortly afterwards got-up, and sheals got out ofbed, and they sat up for more thatwo hours and thenr went to bed again. Very soon aiter they had been In bed a second time the prisoner again got up and she saw hm go and get a rzor, and he approached the bed where she was lying with the ra2or open in his hand. Sho took up a shawl that was on the bed anddtwlstel it round her throat, and the prisomet then seized hold of her. and pnled her out of bed, and she struggled with him to-the door of the room and-then fell down stairs.' The prisoner followed her and again lid hold of her at the stair-foot and he then cut her throat withthe rzor. The wound was in. flicted through the shAwL 'She struggled with him and tried to obtain posei of the azor, and in doing so her, thumb and sevl of her finger rwere severely cut. She at length contrived to get away from him and ran to the police. stion, an as she was going cat of the door of the house she observedthe prisonerin the actofapparentlycattinghis own throat. The pro4eutrix, in answer to questions put to her by Mr. CLERK, said that she had left the house of her husband and gone with her two children to her mother's at New Bomney, and she hAd returned on the 27th of September ofher own accord, and the prisoner £pp d to bevery glad to se her and they were very friendly and happy all day, and nothing particular.occurred until they went to bed. A ver short time after they had been In bed the prsoner sid he coald not sleep and .he would go down stirs, and she told him she would get up too, and they both went and sat by the window for trwo or three hours in their night clothes Their oonversation was of a kind and friendly description. They then went to bed again and a few minutes afterwards the prlsoner said that a fortune,tellerat Dover had told him that tbere would be murder done. The prisoner then got up and she saw him ooming towards her with a razor in his hand, and she bad hardly time to warp the shawl round her throat before the prioner laid hold of her and pulled her out of bed He did not inire her in any manner in the bedroom, but after she had struggled with him and fallen dowR the stain he followed her and cut her throat with the razor. She believed that the prisoner was under the Impresion thtt she wau unfaitS ful tohim, but there was no foundatlon for such a suspidon on her part, and he had accused her of beinglixtimate with gentlemen whom she had never even seen. Theylived vse unhappily In consequence of the prisoner's suspicion that she was intimate with other men. It was only durin the six mouths prior to September that the prisoner entertined this susBplion. It was entirely a deludion on his pert. Her husband was 27 yeas old, and she had heard that his mother was confined in a lunatic sylum and died there Upon re-examination by Mr. Rmnox the prosecutrix said that the reason she left her husband's house on the last occasion was that he acused her of being unfathful to.him, and he had several times threatened to murder her. Re had made these threats before he accused her of being unfaith. ful. He did so when he was in liquor. There was nothin in his conduct during the three years they had been married to induce her to believe that he was mad. He used to work regularly when he could get It, but he sometimes used to Zend nearly all his wages and get drunk and this caused, tner to quarrel. George Geddes, a sergeant of police at Dover, deposed that about ten minutes to 1 o'clock on the morning of the 28th of September the prosecutrix ruhed into the policestation with nothing but her night clothes on and nearly covered with blood. He also observed a large wound In her nocor, and in consequence of what she said he went to theresidewice of theprloner and found him there struggling with auother constable named Bowlee, who was endeavouring to take a razor from him. He at last succeeded in domg so and handed it to witness. It was open andbloody. He observed at the same time that the prisoner had a wound in his throat, and he was subsequently conveyed to the hospital. George Bowles, the consablo referred to by the last witness, deposed that on the night in question he heard a cry of " Murder" from a woman's voice, and on proceeding to the house of the prisoner he saw him standing at the window, and he called out to him, " Go for my brother James, for I am dying." He saw at this time that there was a wound on his throat, and he asked him what was the matter, and he said, in reply, " I have been and done what they wanted to do for U-cuit our throats." At this time the prisoner had a razor in his hand, and wItness asked him to give it to him, but he objectedo do so, and witness took it from him, While the prisoner was at the hospital witness had the charge of him, a4d he several times inquired of him if his wife wag dead, and when he told him she was not he said he was 0 re she would die, as he had given her a good cutting. The prisoner appeared to be quite sober when ho first saw him on the night the affair happened. Crossesmamined.-He did not hear the prisoner sy anything about his having heard people talidng in the street on the night the affair happened. M-r.TJoh lWlter,a suZeon at Dover, deposed that he Ws2 nt for on the night In question, and found the prosecutril lying on the floor of the polioe-staton in a very faint and exhausted stte from loss of blood, and he observed a wound on the left side of her throat. There were also several cuts on the fingers of each hand, and there was a deep cut between the thumb and finger of the left hand. The wound on the throat wasa very dangerous one. A small branch of the jugular vTin 'was divided, and if the IwnDr had extended a small distauce further it must have been morta. Mr. CTRRK made an able address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and he said. that of course it was impossible for him to deny-that the prisoner's was the hand that infilicted the injury upoi the unfortunato proseutrix; but the defence -he was instcted to offer was that by reason of the oondition of hin mind he was not criminally rpon. sible for the act he had committed. He called the attention of£the jury to the facts that the prisoner appeared to have been quite sober on'the night-the oocurrence happened, and that there did not appear to have been any quarrel between the prisoner and his wife, and Xlrged that the act of violenoc had been olely occasioned by a sdden feeling of frnzy wthich the pristoner wvas unable topcontroLe Several'witnesseswrereeanied on behalf of the prisoner,; whose evidence went to'hotw that a short time befe the occurrence took place the prisoner had,exhibitedaigood deal' of eccentricity ihis conduct, and itt was also proved ChA when th6 father of the prisoner was about his age he Vast' under a similar delusion with regard to the fidelity of ther prisoners mother to that exhibited 'by the prisoner, and that hiz mother died in alunatic sylum after having been' confined there for 18 montbz. i.

OXFORD CIRCUIT. WORCESTM Dz 4 (Bcfore Mr. Baron . 1&nT.) Edwara Elsrt, aged 46, labourer, was charged with the wiful murder of Fliza Hart, at Stourbrldge, on the 23d of ARpds, 1857. The med1ical evidence showed that the poor woman had been sufferiug from choleralo diarrhce, and that se had been suffocated; but whether the death was occasioned by thewilful act of the prisoner, or was the result of his drankenness, was so far doubtful that the jury gave him the benefit of the doubt, and found him GuiUy of manslaughter only. Mr. Baron 3MA.TTnz sentenoed the prlsoner to be imprison:ed, with hard labour, for 15 calendar months. Willhim Gibbs, aged 27, grocer, was charged with forging the acceptance to three biUs of exchange. Mr. Best appeared for the prosection; Mr. V. Richards for the prisoner. Tho prisoner pleaded " Guity." It was stated that the prisoner had uttered forged biUs to the extent of 4001., and that when his house was searched as many as 12 other biUs of the same class were found in different stages of completlon. Mr. Baron MA.r;,in passing sentence, said the offences committed by the prisoner were of a most serious description, especally in a commercial oountry, and as the prisoner had committed three sxuh offenoes his Lordship felt bound to pes a very severe sentenoe, which rwas that the prisoner be kept in penal servitude for 20 years. The business of these assizes was brought to a close at a fewF minutes after 4 o'clock, writh the exception of passling sentence upon one prisoner who had been convicted of stealing a beg containing SO sovereigns.

Several of the largest lighters employed in the service have been sent to Chatham to be used in floating her, but in this have but partially succeeded. On Saturday the large force employed succeeded in removing the sunken steamer from her former position and plcing her stem more towards the dockyard, whereby she was considerably eased of the Imnense strain to which she had been formerly subjected. Yesterday renewed attempts were made to Lftt her, and a number of additional chains were passed beneath her keel and made fast to six large lighters A the tide rose Ist evening it was found that the steamer was being lifted and hopes were entertained of being able to remove her at high tide last night. A party of 120 men have left Colchester Camp for Great Glacton, to relieve a similar number of recruits who have been stationed at that place for rifle practice. Considerable numbers of recruits continue to arrive in the camp, the command of whioh has been assumed by Major-General Blade.

I1 proceeded myself with Her Majesty's 8th Weginient, and tihe 4th Punjab Infantry to the right flank, !pr .the purpose of dislodging the enemy and taking their gmis, wiich were raking our camp. On the way I took with m,e the 1st, 2d, andE5th Punjab Cavalry, extending theInfantry in skirmishing order with their suppcrts. I took the cavalry tothe opcn spaco near the Eluropean infantry barracks, vith directions to move as cizcunmaraces would peomit. The 9. pounderAgraabattery had by this time come up. I advanced them in support of the infantry on the road leading frdm the Artillery parade-ground to the Dholopore road, and the skirmishers advanced and cleared 'the corpounds to, their front. . The Punjab Cavalry, under Lieutenant Watson, had then the opportnity. of naklcng & most gallant charge, driving off the enemy's Swaros and capturing four guns. After this the rebels niade no stand on the right, but the left continued to bohotly engaged, and the enemy's Sowarsadvanc6d with great determination on the gun, one of which was disabled from its guners havlng been cut down, and for the moment in the possesion of the enemy. It was, however, instantly recaptured, and the 9th Lancers charged the Sowars and drove them from the field. I regret to say that two most excellent officers, Ideutenants French and Jones, were wounded, the former mortaUly, and I fear that little hope can be entertained of the recovery of Lieutenant Jones. I advanced dauring this time on the Dholepore road, capturing guns as we went on, and the 9th TAncers and Artillery, aupported by the 75th and 2d Punjab Infantry, advanced on the left, taeing four guns on their way. The whole line now moved to the front, the Punjab Cavalry, as usual, performing most excellent service on the flanks, till we reached a villge three miles hence, where we halted for a short time, the whole of the enemy being then in full flight. We were now joined by the Sd Europeans, and Colonel Cotton, commanding at Agra, came up and took command of the whole of the troops. The enoemy's camp was descried about two miles in advance, and we marched upon it, the road strewed in all directions with baggage and carts; the Infantry was ordered to.halt at the camp, and the cavalry and artlllery pursued the enemy to the laree Nuddee, ten and a half miles from Agra, The enemy had crossed the river before we reached it, leaving behind him all his guns, a return of which is attached. The artillery fired grape and round shot at the retreatin enem aoross tbe rnver with good effect. The countryl a roundwas covered witis fgitiveg, of whom a large number were cut up; they have all now crossed the Bharee Nuddee. After a short halt we returned to camp, and the captured guns were all bronght in during the night I have not been able to estimate the enemy's number, as, In addition to the Indore force, and the Neemuch and te Nusseerabad brigades, Sepoys were found kdlled belonging to the 16th Grenadlers, Eurah Light Infantry, C-wallor Contingent, and several others. The whole country -as far as one could see was covered with fugitives, bat of these many were probably camp followers and rabble. I have never seen such a rout, and had our artilery and cavalry been fresh few would have crossed the Kharee Nuddee but they had marched 41 miles In less than 30 hours before arriving at Agra.

AMERiCAN ViEw or ouR LATE FINANcIL C(sis. -On tho 10th of November the government of the Bank of England raised the rate of discount to 10 per cent. This is the highest rate ever imposed by the Bank, and in this single aspect of thecase the meaoure would seem to indicate anactual pressure of great severity, and to prognoeticate further and more serious diffloulties. We do not believe that eithor of these inferences will be vindicated by the pro. gress of events. It should be understood by our own merchants, as it has jus begun to be understood by the merchants of Great Britain, that in the regulation of the rate Of discounts by the Bank of England the Bank fulfils a function of Government. By the Bank Charter Act of 1.84 the Bank was intended to be esablished as a sort of political supervisor of the commercial world, and in the discharge of its functions the Bank now indicates, not the actual pressure upon its resources for accommodations whioh It is unable to afford, but the sense of those in authority that the relations of the foreign commerce of Great Britain are in such a state as to necessitate the exertion by the British financiers of all their power to arrest the outward drain of specie. It may very possibly be the ose that the measures which the Bank has taken have tended to breed a certain confusion and something approaching to a panic in circles where the operation of the Bank Oharter Act is but imperfectly understood; but any misohief which may have been done of this kdnd must have been restricted in its scope, as is clearly shown by the fact that Consols advanced under the application of the additional 1 per cent. The general bases of trade that is remaining firm-the commercial community as a body-were refusing to be thrown offtheir balance by a phenomenon of which they comprehended the cause, an d of which the influtence in contracting operations must necessarily be bothbriefanud slight. It has been calculated that businees can be done at a profit in England when the rate of discount is carried up to 7 per cent., the habitual rate being 5; while in this country the rates of discount osciUate, as we well know, between the extremes of 10 and of 30 per oent, in ordinary times. To expect, therefore, anything like a widespread crash of industry and enterprise in England from a temporary advance of 8 per cent. above the hlghest rate usually considered compatible with continuous profit is simnly absurd. The financial relations of Loiidon with the continent of Europe prefigure no drain in that direction at present. The export of specie to the East had vlrtualU ceased by the 10th, while the normal relations of British trade with this country were resumed on the 11th, wheni the Persialeft this port carrying with herO100,00O4Lingeld. We do not, then, anticipate any protracted financial trouble in England as a result of the state of thin's reported by this arnval. On the contrary, we think the action of the Bank likely to counteract the disturbing effeots of the failures announced, and by throwing out discounters for hoarding to set more free the channeis of actual legitimate financia acti,vity. One point alone of the Bank Charter Act of 1844, which has alwaysl seemed to us of questionable soundness, has, we think, been proved defective in this instance. Tho issue department of the Bank, which is separated from the banng department by the new system, is atrengthened by Giovenmet secuLrities, Instead of specie, to the extent of 14r,)000001., the debt due by the Government to the Bank. Were these securities acquitted by the Government, and the reserve of the issue department reinforced to that extent by specie, there would never probably arise any such urgent occasion tforprotecting the issue of the Bank by a su den advance of the discounting rate as has just been acknowledged, and the Bank would be enabled to do its duty as a regulator with a less spasmodic, and consequently with a less alarming energy.-Zeo York Times, .Nov. 28. A NEw PHAsE OF TKE MORMON DIFFICiuLTY.- It will be seen by the highly important despatchea which have been received by the War Department at Washington that Brigham Young has assumed tha powers of an inde. pendent Sovereign and formaly declared war against the United States. re us for tbis high-banded cours or rather the reasons assigned by the telegraphic reports, are rather contradictory, and will not be accepted by the Government as entirely satisfactory.

Julient's conoerts. Itwasaboid essay on the part of the conductor and the performer to venture on a work of so very elaborate a nature in9peeuce of a " miscellaneous audiepce ;i 'aut M. Jullien has faith In his public, aadgissArabella Goddard had already played the conoerto at her ownv concerts and, those of the Philharmonlc Society with briliant saucces The result was a triumph both for composer and e,xecutaut. MIss Goddard has rarely exhibited her powems to more. eminent advantage. The first and last movements-which would severely tax the mechanical rescurces of. any pianist that ever earned laurels by force of manual dexteilty-- were execated with an ease, grace, and fluency lmpossible to excel; while the slow movement (that, but for.theb evident stamp of Mendelssohn it bears, might have been signed "B Beethoven") was "sang" with an expre6sioni as umafected as the melody with whlch it is overflowing. .The whole performance was listened to with devout' attention, and received with enthusiam. In the violin concerto M. Remenyl, a performer of consummate mechanical skill, failed nevertheless, in a great measure, to realize the intentions of the composer.. The first movement was given in a manner so devoid of fluency. that those previously unacquainted with it niigbLt have, criticized it as fragmentary and wanting in. continityfaults which even in his carhest compositlons; were iaknown to Mendelssohn. The middle .movement was taken so slow, and with a tone so thin and unequal, that all Its charm was lost.

The ocosion was ap'propriat enough. since on the 5th of December, 66 years aeo, the greatest and most universal of compoters breathed his lssti it. the early age of 36, having accomplished for his art, in scarcely more than half the time, almost as much as Hamidel himself; and in a sphere greatly more vared. Had Mozart being permitted to live and work for a longer period, the Reoiem, the litany in B flat, and othermasterpieecs, are enough 'to encourage the belief that he mlght hive rivalled Handel in sacred music just as he smupassed himIn the other styles. The audiences at these conoerts when the nameof Mbozvar' a,ppears as the chief attraction are on a level with those of tne Philharmonic Society in readiness of appreciation, and superior to them in genuine enthusiasm. Itis a grave error to suppose that such 2qinposerm as Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn wrote only for the learned. On the contrary,' like Shakspeare and Molilre, they addressed themselves to the world. Not pedants, but men of genius, what they had to say was of such value, and so eloquently exprssed, as to merit universal attention. Mozart no siore addressed himself exclusively to mudcians than Raphael to painters. Only those vho are indifferent to what is ideal and wtical wl have the boldness to deny that fami'airty with his works leads to a love of them, and that the delight and Instruction they are equaUy calculated to impart must inevitably exercise a refining influence. If such be not the case, the high Place art has held in the esteem of civilized nations may Se looked at as a chimera, and those who from time Immemorial have been endowed with rarer gifts than the majority of their fellows will have laboured to no other purpose than that of figuring conspicuously in a " foors paradise" of their own creation. So long as M. Jullien perseveres in a system which induces him to entertain the general publls (by whom his concerts are mainly supported) with what the members of the " fast" school are accustomed to sneer at, as " high art"but which is none the less' estimable on that account-those who do not wholly regard life as a varlegated puppet-show, will continue to believe that the popularity he has acquired in the course of 20 years has not been without advantage to the community. The docorous attention with which the miusc of Mozart was listened to by the compact and orderly crowd assembled on Saturday nig t was In every rgspect gratifying. The programme combined materials which represented the composer under his most brilliant aspect. The grand pieces were the Zaube)fl"ite overture, the Jupiter symphony (than which no sculptor's imaginary " Juplter" waS ever more colos3al and imposing), and the pianoforte concerto in 0 major, No. 1, not No. 2, as erroneously advertised in thebills. To hear these wonderful composittons wasas good asinsDpeting three of the noblest achievements of pictorial art, with the advan. tage that, while only a few individuals can conveniently examine a picture in society, as many as 3,000 were able to enjoy the music at one and the same time, and to share in each other's emotions. The overture and symphony were splendidly executed, under the direction of M. Jullien. On no occasion1 indeed, has his orchestra more honourably distinguished itself. The audience, alive to the exoellencehboth of the music and the performance, were as unanimous as discriminating in their tokens of approval, The planoforte concerto, intrusted to the experienced hands of Miss Arabeila Goddard, created an extraordinary sensation. The beauty of the music, its novelty, and the perfection of the playing united in eliciting this result The concerto was not merely new to M. Jullien's audience; it ,had never been played in England since the days of Cramei, Steiba4t, and Dnssek; and seldom has a piece of music so little deserved segect. The first of Mozart's concertos for the piano (of which no less than 17 Are engraved), it is also the model uon which the others arebunilt. Besides Its melodious p haes, which, like the flowers i a wel tended garden, enchant the sense by their beauty and variety, eh of the three movements into which it Is ditrnbuted displays that falless symmetry of form, for wwhbh Mozmit mo.e than any other composer, is distinuished. Everything comes exactly in the pro,per place, and theimpresslon left at the end lsguch as can only beproduced by wvorks where the art of conceahing art and,the grace and fluency thatspnaeu ivnto arpedrnn. Ring from spontaneous inveaMon are predomlnant. he prevalent style of the concerto is simple, almost bucolic, but this relates exclusively to the ideac, the skIll vwith which the various movements are oonducted ennobling that which is primitlve,andsettingforkthe whole vith a lustro that only the most consmmaste work ip can attain. To perform such mueic well demoads a higher gift than that of mechaical dexterity, however great. The at of expression which can Invest the homeliest phrases wlth a grace that precludes all chance of their bein regarded as common place belongs to few, more especally now, when rhodomontade so often passes for imagination, and mere impetuosity for enthusiasm. Unadulterated meIody like ozart's admit of no such treatment, but mus; be approached with reverence, Mbiss Goddard's playing displaysed the qualities required; Nt wva aS pure as the mudoic and-like atrueartist4 aiming, rather to make Mozart understood than to obtrude herselt, to shine by his light rather than her own-she accomblished her task to admiration, winning the esteem of every capable judge, Miss Goodard introduced nO " Ckers" in the first movement-althou'h tradition warrants such interpolations, wrhiob, 'when tlevely, contrived, are both appropriate and effective-and only a very short one (from Cramer) in the litt.

Roderigo crwled out as well as he could, and sat down on some spars which wee on the deck. The dektain said td him, lIfeI catch you In that foreemte agamn during yotir watch on deck I wll give you some more - and he told the secon nate to keep him At work-on the look-out, if he could do nothing else.

Roderigo could not move quicker- he WAS in a dying state t Thn. Iwasrlieved at thewhe nd ther optainws stil kicking Roderigo. About ten minutes afterwards I saw Roderigo crawling on the deck on his hands and knees; failing flat every minute.

AminrSoN oF Jzws To PAInKT,=.-On Wednesday last there was a crowd.d meeting of the inhabitanleof Jedburgh, in the Crown-lane Assembly-rooms, for the purpose of adopting a petition to Parliament for the removal of Jewish disabilities, Mr. G.Rutherford, sheriff clerlk in the chair. The Hon. W. F. Campbell enforced the propriety of repealing the Abjurition OAth in a lulcid and logical speech, in the course of which he referred to-- various historical points connected with the question. Mr. Campbell commenoed by admitting that there was ndt s much fervour in the country in regard to the claims of BaronRothschild as to render argument superfiuous, but atthe same time there was not so much coldaess and oblivion as to make argument imprope Unless the Jewish. dalms. continued to be urged, they would loee the ground they had already gpined, After alluding to the various efforts madeto enable Jews to sit in Parliament, Mr. Campbell said henow ventured to submit to them as a sounder meagure than thoee formerly suggested, the unmixed repeal of that single oath by which Baron RothschildL was exeluded. The anomalous position of Baron. Rothschild and the city of London which returned himmight be multiplied to any point. In this way a hundred towns might be disfranchised without violating any Act oe Parliament whatever. Iu 1850 ana 1851 the disorders incidental to this striking contradiction were brought out Jin soenes which could not be forgotten. A Jewish member forLondon and the Jewish member for Greenwich in thosew years a-erted the right which the electors had confrrzeW upon them. Mr. Salomons addresssd the Houns, and the perplexity which followed-chaos It nlghtbe termed-persuaded observing men that the law required alteration. To prevent such dangerousand unseemly eonflictsforthefuture,itwasnecessaryto impos a reliou-' test on candidates, or to withdraw it from the members. Toimpose it upon candidates, and so prevent men who were not. qualfied to swear from being elected by constituencies, was .a course which no party in the State had ventured to bring .forward. Conservatives and Liberals had tacitly renounoe it, although it didnot seem more harsh to impose religiouz. tests before than after the elections. lu point of fact, if a religious test ought not to be exactd on the hustings, it ought not to be exacted In theHouse. The present law appeared far too like trap. for the oDnstituencies. If, therefore, no party would con-. sent to rehgious dclrations from the hustings their abolition iD the ouse of Commons was inevitable. Mr. Cams bell then traced the origin of the Oath of Abjuration. We" said that soon after the famous epoch of 1688, by whiqh Scotland was delivered from oppresdon.and all the islanid from reproach, our anoestors determined to set;te theoaths to be imposed on members of the Legislature, under the, system which the wisdom of the nation. and the virtue of the Prince of Orange had created.' The form of oathlsbelonging to the former dynasty were ab-- rogated On the death of James II. the Pretender wa acknowledged by the Government of Frnce. Thereupon It was resolved that no peace Ahould be made without. ample reparation for the indignity the French ingbadoffered; 40,000 men were voted for lnd, and 40,000 for sea service. An attainder was directed againt thepretended Prince o Wales, and to clone thee martal demon. strationsmade,anoath toabjurehisrightsfell into thesystaes of themoment. Asthe preamblestatesitwasaresponettothe. foreign Powerwhich aclmowledgedthePretender; and as if still further to distinguish it from the permnsnent and settle& oaths of 1089, a reference to Christitnity was added, ofwhlch Baron Rothschild ws now unh pily the victim. The pretext of the new oath expired th the war wricth had occasioned it. At a more distant period the Pretenderexpired too. In still later times the whole of his decen-. dants were exhausted, but yet the Oath of Abjuration stil continued to exist. Mr. Campbell contended that there weremany grounds on which its repeal might be demanded. It ought to be repealed, if only for the reason tht laws. enacted for a temporary purpose ought not to be permitted to outlive the purpose whlch anMedted them. M1r. Campbel then asked If it could be donuet that the long resitnee of the House of Lords toeTwIh claims had hada be ect. xpon its Influenoe. He did not mean to argue that th House of Lords ought to. be censured or all thee Jewiah Bills it had throwL out, but only tVA. its attitude of discord with the House of Com. mons and the city had tended to its prejudioe, and tt attituae, he mid would certainly remain unatiltbe di*. abilitic. had vanished. When they merely asked Parli&. ment to recur to the well-considered sstem of 689, torestore the Bill of Rights to Its iutegrity, to bring back our constitution to the standrdfrom whicbh aCidis had dlverted it, the mind must be strangely constituted which venture& to reist a prayer so fra lt with moderation and: rerve, andso congenial to ite honour of the eo6mtm By repealing the Oath of Abjuration and settling the Jewis claims, they would take away the disposition to tape with the Roman Catholic Relief Act, and violate the Pr tesatopinion of the country whlich ap3intho ~rejeted Bitl of I 854, and which if still Indilged, it w.&I. *sultto measure the reslts of'.
