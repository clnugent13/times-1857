XOTTIINGHAM. JAie. 24.
The prosperity which has, attended the labours of the agriculturists as a class during several successive years has produced a larger extent of enterprise and effort among them than has ever before been witnested. They do not hide their gaing, and remain satisfied with old rates of production, but by tbel emoploYment of extra labour are bringing their farms into the best possible oDndition withi regard to working the soil and to cleaniliness while bOy a liber-al oatlay in the bigher class of manure they are increasing the weight and quality of the several erops beyond expocintiou. Since guano has become so excessively dear, however, its hoot substitute is found to be superphosphates which, being comnposed of the same chymical1 couibinations, or nearly so, are found to answer as wrell, while the outtlay Is purchasing them is much gmaller. Their effect upon the cereal crops is astounding,while for turnIps thereis nothieg like them. Moderate applIcatons force the young plants through their earlier anidmore dangerous stage, with such rapidity as to PreTent their being injured by the fly, while the waight of the bu'.s is increased by maniy tens pot acre, finch were the observations making at this Coem-exchange to-day by the mnost experienced farmers, while discussing present and future prospects.
The mnarket was well supplied with wheat; fine samples made nearly as much as Last week ; inferior and damp ones were Is. to 2e. lower. The supply of barley was larger than for some time ; choice samples could hardly be called cheaper, but coarm qualities made Is less. The preset price are :-Wheat, white, 62s. to 6iS&; red, 55s. to 62rs ; harley, for maltlng, 44s, to 82s. ; for grinding, 33s. to 38s. ; oatg, old, Ms. to Ms ;new, 2Ge to31S&; beans, old,i0s, to 53s. ;newr 3ha to 43s.; flour, super, 41s. to ile, ; fine, 41s. to 41s.
IMOESTEE, JANe. 24.
The weather has been variable, and, althoughi thieEe sudden Changes are said to be unfavourable to the progress of the young wheat, at preset there are few complaints, and in most distr;cts the young plant in looking heslthy. Farmmers, howrever, refer to the damp weather deteirleat'ng their samp,les which are being threshed out. There is an ample supply of food for cattle. The price of fat stock, is fully maIntained. At this mnarket, with a moderate supply of beatste beef sold at 6Ctd. to Id.; sheep were less plentiful, and mautton realized 7d. to 8d.
At Melton fair there was a good chow of horses, and useful cart colts sold at high price.
At this cern-market wheat sold at a reduction of Is. in barley these was no alteration. Oats EuppoDrted previous caain. Prices :-Whits wheat, fOr, to 67g.; red, iSa. to 62e. ;Oats, 2ks to IsS. beans, 48s. to ide. ;fine flour, 45ia.; seconds, 4l. and thlrds~, 413.
At Loughbberough wheat sold at a reduction of Is. to 2s, The other local markets were weaker.
DERBY, JAIf;. 24.
The weather has been changeable, and agricultural oPerations have progressed favourably. The accounts respecting the appearance of the young, wheatg are satisfactory ; still cold and.seasonable weather in much wanted.
The price of fat stock Is a shade higl er. At this market, vrith a good supply of beasts, beef sold at Cd. to 61,d. Sheep were rather scarce, and made very goodI prices mutton selling at 7 id, to Sd.
At Bakewell, with a short supply of beasts, beef sold at 7s. to So. Fat mutton realized 61sd, to 7d.
At this corn-market5 with, a fair supply, wheat sold at a deelin of is, Barley was rather easer. Priices ;-White wheat, C6s. to 68& .; red, Wse, to f2e. ; malting barley, 46a. to iCe. ; grinding, [833 to 41s. . new oats, 29a, to 33s ;old, I4a. to 3lie,; flour, 430. to 44s. ; uper.: due, to 46a.
NORTHA?.iPTON, JAes. 24.
The weather is Tariable, yet farmers are progressing satisfatorily with out-dooDrwork. The young wheats.notic?ith-tauding the changeableness of the season, are well spoken of; cold weather would, how. ever, do good.
The price of fat stock In exceedingly high. At Peterboreugh, with a fairs upply of beasts, beef made 7s. Gd. to Es. Sheep were a moderate show, and mnutton sold at 6.1d. to 7id.
At this corn-market, with a fair show of wheat, good sampleg of white made W.s, and red 60a, Matting barley of good quality sold at Ste. In other sorts of grain there was not much alteration.

LINCOLN, JAsrT. 24.
The wreather has been open, and farming w-ork hag progressed satIn. facLotor. The young wheata are, generally speaking, looking weil, but frosty weather would be benieficial in preventing them grOWing too fast. The short periods of fros have been taken advantage of for purposes of wheat thrashing, but, as a whole, the reason has not been favourable for that irmportant operation, and consequently many indifferent samples have been offered at the local markets. The damp weather has had an infuence upon tue-nIps, and in some parts they are a good deal injured. Food for stockinsabundant,but yet keeps up is price
Fat stok is seling at ver high sates At this markek, with a fair supply of beasts, beef madeIs.6d. tos&So.Seep wereoatolerble show, and mutton sold at Id. to 7id. At Boston, with a good supply of sheep, mutton made 71d to 3d.
At this coom-market, with a tolerable show, wheat sold at a decline of is. Barley about the same as last week. Pricee :-White wheat, 63e. to 8Ie.; red, 58s. to62s. ; bariey, 44e. to 62.
At Sleaford wheat was se. cebaper. In barley these was a reductiont of Is. At Gainsborough wheat sold at a decline of is. to 2s. Baricy was the terns cheaper. At Spalding wheat was Is. cheaper. In barley there was an advaneo of Is. At Lynn wheat was is. to Se lower. At Louth wheat sold at a reduction of Is, Barley was rather deare.
DONCASTER, JAle. 24.
With the exception of a light frost in the middle of the week the weather has again been mild, with frequent showers of rats. The wheat trade at the comrn arLkets In this locality has undergone a forther depression of from Is, to 2s. ; even the best samples have expo. rienced a decline, notwithstanding a fair inquiry for them, the reduction being owitng, on the one hand, to the abundant supplies which the farmems continue to pour into the markets, and, en the other, to tbedeteriorated conditioni in which grain still comes forward. Barley experienced a cheek in itis upward morement last week, and it has taken a turn lower, the fall amounting to about is. on melting sampaesm and So. on the finer sorts. Bothx oats and beans have been in bettor request, a good deal of firmness pervading the trade, especially in the best qualities of oats,
At to-day's market thero was an abundaLnt show of wheat, the con. dition of which, generally speakng, was indifferent. Holders evinced maore readiness tomake sales aLt some reduction en former rates which gave an impetus to the demand, and the maarket closed with steadiness at a decline of Cd. to Is. on isecondry and inferior samples, but some of the best lots realized as much as last week. Barley was in good supply, and malltekrg would only purchase at a reduction of Is Oats were somowhat briaker, but the improvement In dmnand did noi quotably affect the price. The followingame the quotations :--Wheat, ifs, to SOs. pe load of three Imperial bushels; O fne, 22s. to 2ls, 6d.; beans, 16e. to 2ls. , peas, 1ie, to 16s. ; new oats, 20te, to 2Si.

The cattle trade haebeen briskc, with somewhat higher prices. Hero to-day holders of stocke demanded mome money, notwithstanding a rather inferior show as regards quality. Sheep firm ; store pigs,25S. to 50e. ; pork-era, lie. to 2ls,; pork, Is. tol7s. Cd.
WOIICESTER, JA-e. 24,
Theme was not a very good attendance at mark-et to-day. Millers offered les money, and, farmers being unwilling to mak t-he required abatement, business was mall. The sales effected in wheat were, however, at a deeline of folly. Bis.Eglish white wheat, 15. 6d. to ls. 9d. for new, and 7s. 9d. to 8so. 3d. for old per bushel ; red wheat, 6s. Pd. to 7e. 3d. ; melting barley, 6e. 6d. to 6s. Sd, and distillng Ss. 3d. to 6s. per bushel ; English oats s. dsto 4s. 3d. per 391b., and Irish Is. Cd. to 4s.
Thelocal markets have been dull. At Wolverhampton, on Wedaes, day, although the supply was short, wheat was Ia. 6d. to ha. lower, At Eldaemminster-, on Thursday. the supply was good and wheaLt Is. cheaper, melting barley declining Is. to Is and sate Is, At Broms. grove transactions were limited at a decline of 2s. in wheat. Malting barley maintained its Talue, but grinding Is. cheaper. Evesham'mar. ket was maoderatelyltteuded and trade dull, hut no material alteration In the value of corn.
Worceter annual New-year fair 'was held on Mionday. These was a very limited supplyv of sheep on offer and an unusually large attendance of buyers a goo-d deal of the mutton being actually sold on the road before reaching the mnarket. Beef wmas aso in short supply. Wether mutton produced lid. to 8d. ; ewes, 7d, to lid. ; cows, 6id. to 71.d. ; and cows and calves and barrens were muchL inquired for at siring prices, Pigs quiteoas dear,fetohingIlOs.6d.tolls.

The trade for wheat has been declining in the mDarkets of the district, especialy for wheat, which the rillenr are not disposed to tak:o at former rates. At our market to-day there was a fair quantity on offer, but lttle ould be dispoed of, and where the farmers pregsed sales they were at a reduction of ful Ss. to 3s. The farmera were unwing to submit to this, and most of the samples were taken back. Barley was not o mnuch in demand as of late, and the prices for it were lower.

There bas been a pDcular state of weather duiring tho past week Snow fell for hours on Tuesday, and at night it was succoeded by a sharp frost. Since then rain has fallen extensirely, and the tompera-. tuor has been tolerably mild. The land is now so gencrally saturated that out-door operations have been suspended, and tho damp weather has also tended to check the thrashing of wheat.
At the corn-market this morning the show of wheat wavr mderato, and there was a scarcity of fino dry parcels.

Crime And Criminals.
CRIME ANrD CBIXIAALS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES.
Sir,-As I believe that every contribution from those whoso position qualifies them to form an opinion on the subject possesses some value, I venture to forward to you a few remarks touching the question which is at present engaging the attention of so many thoughtful and earnest men-the increase of crime, its causes, and its remedy.
The total number of prisoners committed to the common gaol of the county of Surrey during the 12 months ending Mscbaelmas, 1856, was mnales, 2 357 -females, 624 ; total, 2,981l Of these 94 males and' 19 feieales were under 13 years of age. Therewere 244 married men and 126 married women, having 708 and 373 children respectively; 16 wvidowers and 21 widows, having 42 and 51 children respec. tively; 104 married men and 84 married women, having no children. In all 364 males and 142 females, having each an average of 2 and 3 children respectively.
During the same period and of the foregoing number there weretrieaattheassizes,generalandadjournedquartersessions, and Central Criminal Court, 467 males and 117 females; total, 584; of which 440 were committed from the metropoistan phe corirts, 105 by the county magistrates, and 39 appeared in court. Of the remaining 2,981 about 13 per cent. were discharged and the others dealt with by the magistrates summarly, under the Criminal Justico Act. and consisted almost entirely of Southwark and Lambetli offenders.
By observing the foregoing particulars a great numerical disproportion will be remarked between provincial and me. tropolitan commitments, evidencing the gregarious nature of criminals, induced, of course, by the numerous temptations to plunder and the facilities of disposing of their booty, which large cities present. It is this tendency to congregate in certain localities which is perfectly welU known and defined, that I would first of aU attack. If the provisions of the act for the Regulation of Cemmon Lodgmghouses are not sufficiently stringent they should be
m.ade more so. Every one of those dens of iniquity known. to be the resort of professional thieves and their associates, in the Mint, Kent-street, and Lock's-fields, should be forthwith indicted by the authorities, as even more fatal and demoralizing than the gaminghouses and brothels which already are subjected to a similar wholesome treatment. I am confident that very much might be done to repress crime by a systematic improvement of the dwellings of the lower orders; for no one but those who have witnessed it can form any idea of the physical and moral pollution which reeks round the favourite abodes of vice and wickedness in the localties I have named, and which, singular to say, are tho property, in the case of Kent-street, of a corporation which represents physical pulity-to wit, St. Thomas's Hospital, and, in the case of Lock's-fields, of a corporatioR which represents moral beauty-to wit, the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury. Certainly, the dispr. sion of the predatory tribes of this metropolis, and I thorough purification of the neighbourhol ds wherein vice and crime have established their prescriptive head. quarters, are subjects worthy of serious and immediate consideration.
Again, the very smaU proportion of married persons among the criminal population, as shown in the foregoing return, is well Vorthy of notice. The fact clearly ilius. trates the humanizing ifluence of the marriage tie ; while the low average of children dependent upon married persons who havebeen charged with offences no less evidently proves that dishonesty is rarely the effect of want; that, in fact, it is less position than disposition which prompts to crime. Thisremark derives a stroinig confirmation from the fact that in the months of Deceimnber and January, 1855 6, there were 555 committals ; and in July and August, 1856, 576that is to say, the number committed during the two most trying months of the year, when the days are shortest and the opportunities of obtaining employment fewest, was actually exceeded by the number committed in a swason when tho exact contrar" influences prevail.
If these remarks can iU any degree asist those who are devoting their attention to this important subject in eluci. dating the question they are considering I shall congratulate myself on having made them. I fear to encroach upon your patience by adding to the length of my letter, though there is so much to be said whichlIhavepassed byunnoticoed Oye opinions, I know, can carry but little weight, and I
ofr them with diffidenceandmistrust. StiUno thoughtfal man can pass hours daily among beings so unfortunate, s0 wayward, and sofignorant, without having gained some knowledge of the peculiarities of the class a mong whom he ministers, and on this ground I respectfully presunme to add mny contribnUton to the information you are so usefaUly collecting. I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient faithful servant,

The railway meetings of the week have presented few facts of interest. The dividend of 5 per cent. guaranteed by the lessees of the Middlesborough and Guisborough Railway has been declared. The consideration of the proposal for the sale of the line to the Stockton and Darlington Company is temporarily adjourned. The directors of the Oxford, W"orcester, and Wolverhampton Company announce that the net earnings of the half-year will enable them, after defraying debenture charges, to pay the full dividend at the rate of (6 per cent. on the first preference stock and to carry over a small balance. At the meeting of the Royal Swedish Company the report of the directors was adopted, and they were authorized to make another coall on the preference thares at the end of two months. The shareholders of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, after some discussion, have agreed to the various guaranteed preference dividends, and to a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum on the original stock. After a discussion on the report the proposals of the directors, respecting the agreement for promoting and leasing the projected Ashton, Oldham, and Guide-bridge Railway, and carrying out the Buxton Extension, were sanctioned. The report of the Carmarthen and Cardigan Company, detailing the progress of works, has been adopted. The line will he of cheap construction, and will afford accommodation to an important district, in addition to constituting part of a trunk route through the centre of Wales, and opening a direct communication from Manchester to Milford Haven.
An official intimation is stated to have been received by Mr. Andrew, the chairman of the European and Indian JunctionTelegraph Company, from the,Treasury, to the effect thatthe Government will be preparedto execute a contract, stipulatingto pay, conjointlywith the Eaet India Company, from the dateof the completion of the telegraph, 12,0001. per annum for 25 years, or so much of it as shall be necessary to make up, with the other receipts of theCompany, a dividend of 6 per cent. WVhen the profits of tne Company shall exceed 12 per cent. the Government and the India-house are to have the power of making a reduction in the tariff for conveying messages, but not to an extent that, calculating the traffic of the two preceding years, will reduce the dividend below that amount. The Govermnent require 20 percent. of the capital to be paid up previously to the execution of the contract as security for the bonafiles of the undertakin; and it is also provided that, " to insure to the Governmient that supervision and control to which their stake in the enterprise justly entitles them, the Treasury shall have the power of appointing one official director" to represent their interests. Application has been made to the East India Comrany to allow Sir William O'Shaughnessy to act as consulting engineer. Six per cent. will accrue to the shareholders from the date of the payment of the first call.
The Australian Agricultural Company have issued a report prepalatory to their half-yearly meeting on the 30th. A loss appears to have been incurred on the operations of the company for 1855 of 4,4101., and no dividend is recommended. The agricultural department, having proved a failure, is to be extinquished. The last returns of stock show 43,094 sheep, 0,947, cattle, 1,276 horses and ponies, and 55 asses and mules. During the year 10,530 store wethers and, 00 cattle -were purchased for 5,7871. The sales in the same period amounted to 11,3431. Wool also produced 8,8921., and land at Newcastle and Port Stephens 12,3581. The number of persons Employed by the company was 380, of whom 31 were natives or Chinese. With regard to the collieries an abstract is given of the favourable report of Mr. Odernheinmer, but it is stated that, ovwing to the damage infiicted on the coal trade in 1855 by the excitement in the labour-market, the Withdrawal of the ocean steamers, and the speculative shipments from England, the profit derived from them was cnly 6771., while 9,2121. was expended in their developement. They are now, however, yielding supplies previously unattainable. The arrival of the engines and machinery despatched from London has not yet been advised. On the Port Stephens estate a large formation of magnetic iron ore has been discovered, and a Government survey is now in progress from the harbour to the Sew England district, which it is hoped may result in a road being made. A new township has been laid out in the harbour, to be named after the Governor-General, Sir William Denison. Mr. Hodgson, the newr superintendent of the company, had arrived out in September, and had formed a Committee of advice at Sydney, consisting of Meqsrs, Arthur Daniel, Edward Knox, and Wiliam Brown.
A correspondent calls attention to the extent to which raw spirits distilled from grain in England are mixed with brandy in France aud re-shipped here as the produce of that country. The quantity of British spirits exported to France in 1855 was 3,068,766 gallons, at a value of 660,7501., which would give an average price of 4s. 3d. per gallon. In the same year the quantity of brandy imported from Frauce was 1,861,390 gallons, the value being 91l.1,3051., or about 9s. 9d. per gaUon, It is pointed out that, after allowing ls. 3d. per gallon for expenses in freight, re-distiUation with wine, &c., a profit is thus obtained of 100 per cent.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day it was an. noumced, in relation to the estate of the Royal British Bank, that the dividend of 5s. Gd. in the pound will be paid on Saturday next and the following Monday and Tuesday to the creditors who have proved their debts since the last dividend sitting. The -whole of the creditors having thus been placed in the same position, another dividend will, it is thought, be declared in about a month or six weeks.
An adjudication in bankruptcy has been obtained against John Paul, the clerk in the City of London Union, charged witlh embezzlement, who is described as a corn and secd merchant of Bedford and St. Mlary-Axe. It is stated that this is the third occasion on which Paul has been made a bankrunt.
It is understood that the wlhole capital of 100,0001
for the Thames Ironwvorks and Shipbuilding Company, formed to carry on the works of Mare and Co., was paid into their bankers' in one day. The facilitiesr of the Limited Liability Act have thus prevented one of the largest establishments on the Thames, which has hitherto afforded employment to a great number of artisans, from being broken up.
The last accounts from Vigo state the injury sustained by the Royal mail steamar Tamar to b trifling, although, from the absence of the means of repair at Vigo, her passage to Brazil will be greatly delatd. The latest telegraphic reports regarding the T1ne tend to confirm the expectation that that vessel will be safely floated off.
According to the monthly circular of Messrr. W. and R. Laird, the exports of coal for December were 318,930 tons, against OnlY 223,878 tons in the eorresponding month of 1855. The chief inerease was to Frane.
The amount paid into the Trearury of the East India House for bills on India, from the 9th to the 24th inst., was 51,4871.'
The E3migration Commissioners have advertised for a vessel to carry emigrants to Sydney between the 10th and 17th of March, as may be hereafter determined.
The amnexed information relative to the progress
of English mining adventure is condensed from the Miining Journal.-
"A very large business has been transacted, and the demand for good mines would seem to increase. The committee of the Stock-Exchange have resolved to admit British dividend and progressive mines into the official list, and thus open a new market for these securities. The directors of the Delvonisbire Great Consolidated Copper blining Coiimpainy have declared a dividend of 14,3361., being 141. per share, out of profits arising from sales of copper ores sampled mn the months of September and October last

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Kendal on Thursday; Mr. L. Heyworth, M.P, in the chair.
The report stated that the directors had institUted a most searching investigation into the accounts and dividends of the company, and the result had confirmed their previous persuasion that no money had been improperly expended, and that the income and expenses of tho company were legitimately and accurately stated. This investigation has enabled the directors to conclude that the capital account may henceforth be considered closed, and they direct attention to the fact that if the amoiunt invested in the hotel and houses at Windermere, as wel as the amount of land sold, be deducted from the expenditure, it would be found that the cost of the line was very little above 20,0001. per mile, including the whole of the working plant and stations and extra sidings, as well as the remainder of the land wbich the company have stil on hand. The leading features of the revenue account are an increase of 2411. on the passengers and 2991. on goods and minerals, being a total inurease of 5411. as compared with the corresponding half-year of 1855. The working expenses have slightly decreased ; the duty, rates, maintenance, and interest have increased, leaving the net balance of increase 4971. on the half-year, the actual amount of net income boing 2,1381. At the lsst mneeting it was decided to take from the income one-third of the cost of the new engine, and two-thirds from the reserved profits; consequently 1,5381. was the amount available for dividend for the past half-year. A dividend of 2s. 6d. per share would leave 9801. to be carried to the reserve fund. In September last the Lancaster and Carlisle Company intimated that it was their intention to " conduct their goods business with the town of Kendal and neighbourhood at their Oxenholnae station ;" in fact, to endeavour to appropriate to themselves the goods traffic of the town. As the line had been constructed by the consent and with the sanction of the Lancaster and Carlisle Company, to serve as a branch for that line to the town of Kendal, great expenditure having been incurred for that special purpose ; and, moreover, as the company had formed its relations for the conveyance of goods with other companies, the directors did not feel authorized to surrender to another company a large portion of the terminal charges the i(endal Company were entitled to receive for coUecting, forwarding, and distributing the goods between Kendal and other places, and collecting the charges upon those goods. A proposal to refer the matter to arbitration was refused, and in return an offer was made by the Lancaster andCarlisle Company to give a certain fLxed sum as a rental for the Kendal and Windermere line, which the directors felt bound to decline. On the 1st of January the Lancaster and Carlsle Company commenced its opposition to this company by carting goods down from Oxenholme, and had stopped goods to the utmost extent of its power. Under 'hese circumstances the directors appeal to the shareholders for their support. The expenditure on capital account amounted to 228,6781. The traffic for the halt-year ending the 31st of December amounted to 7,3281., the expenses to 2,5021., and the interest on debentures and preference shares to 2,6871., leaving a net balance of 2,1381.
On the motion of the CILUc MAN the report was adopted, and Mr. E. Crewdson was elected an auditor.
The meeting was then made special to consider a notice sent by the Lancaster and Carlisle Company of their intention to terminate all through rates on and after the 1st of January, 1857.
After some discussion a resolution was passed authorizing the directors to submit the matter to arbitration, if the Lancaster and Carlisle Company would agree to that mode of settlement.
A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the pro-
EASTERN COIUNTIES.
The attention of the Board of Trade has beon called by cestain residenits of Norwich to the partial disuse of the Victoria station in that city. The terminus of the Norfolk Railway at Norwich is in Thorpe hamlet, while that of the Eastern Union Railway (the Victoria) is in St. Stephen's, a totally different part of the city. Since the working agreement was entered into between the Eastern Counties and the Norfolk and Eastern Union Comnpanies the number of trains leaving and arriving at the Victoria (Eastern
Union) station has Nen greatly diminished, a great portion of the traffic having been diverted by a branch connecting the Norfolk and Eastern Union lines with the Thorpe station. The Board of Trade decline to interfere, as theconsider they have no means of giving effect to any order they may make on the subjeet.
LLANELLY AND LLANDILO.
This line was inspected by the Government inspector on Tuesday last, and opens to-day for public traffic. The length of the lineis seven miles, and it forms a continuation of the old Llanely Railway to LIandilo. When the Vale of Towy line is completed, which is expected to be the case in the course of a few months, it will extend the line from
aiandilo to the agricultural and mining districts of Llandovery. Mr. J. a uel, the engineer, has succeeded in completing the hinc within Ihis estimate of 8 0001. per mile, and it appears the works have been exccuted m a substantial and satisfactory man,ner. The Vale of Towey line is being constructed at a similar cost under the same engineer, and the completion of it is looked forward to with great interest by persons locally interested.

BAILWAY MOALITy.
TO THE EDITOR OF THEI TIMES.
Sir,- -If the following facts appear to yon to be worthy of a place in your columns, their insertion vrould convey sonme information to the GreatWestern shareholders and the pubEe.
At the last half-yearly meeting of the company at Bristol a commaittee was appointed to consult with the directors as to some alteration in the constitution of the board.
After much corres,condenee, the comnnittee and the board have entirely failed to come to any agreement, except that their differences should he decided by their shareholders at the next meeting on the 13th of February, and that in the meniantidme the conflicting reports should be printed and eir-
So far all is legitimate on either side, but just observe the next proceeding of the directors; they circulate the reports, indeed, as agreeda upon, but many days previous to their sending them out, and therefore before the bulk of the shareholders were even aware of- their exist'ence, they address circulars to those of the shareholders only whom they think favourable to themselves, omi'ting those presumed not to be so, applying for their proxies to be sent to the chairman; thus endeavouring, and I doubt not largely succeeding, in entrapping shareholders into an unwary disposal of their proxies in favour of one of the parties now on their trial before the proprietary previous to their having been aware in many cases of there being any controversy whatever pending for them to decide upon.
I Will not attempt to characterize this policy myself-I only ask- what would be thought of it in ordinary business or mn private life.
I trust-that the shareholders will give a practical proof of their opinion of this proceeding, by fwituholding their roxies previous to the half-yearly meeting on the 13th of ebrury, or bywithdrawing them if they have been indaced to lyve tem nderaa erroneous impressionu
I trouble you with my card, and am, Sir, your very obedient servant.

State Of Trade.
STATE OF TRADE.
MANCHESTER, JAN. 24.
The mark-et opened this week with very little business, and there was an inactivity for some days that gradually increased the number of sellers anxious to realize, till prices were decidedly easier. The greater firmness in the cotton. market at Liverpool for a day or two past has, however, prevented the decline from going further for the present, and spinners this morning and yesterday have effected sales at rather better rates. The msarket is the more liable to these flnctuations now, because many spinners and manufacturers hold rather heavy engagements for future delivery. Thero continues to le a large busie6s still for Russia in 40's mule, which is comparatively dear, and somne other numbers. In 36-inch shirtings there is not much business, but prices are steady for what there is. India and China shirtings are very difficult to sell, but most of the best makers are still under contract. SeUers holding stocks are obliged to 6nbmit to a small concession. For domesties and printing cloths there is a moderate business, without any variation in prices worth noting. The question of cotton supply continues to be a subject of great anxiety to aUlversons connected with trade. Messrs. George Fraser, S. on, and Co., in their monthly circular, taking the most probable estimates of supply at 3,000,000 bales, which is 500,000 less than that of last year (itself faUing rather short of the requirements of the trade, say that of this deficiency probably 150,000 to 200, ases will be drawn from India in excess of what was received thence during last year, or probably more, should the hostilities with China be protracted. Again, they think that, as usual when cotton is dear, the consumption will be lessened by the greater use of fine and the decreased demand for coarse counts of yarn. But, making aU these allowances, they consider that the immediate prospect of supply Is unsatisfactory. Advert. ing, however, to the suddern fall of prices in the spring of l8n1, when cotton had attained about the same high value as at present-a fall of 2sd. to 3d. per lb. in yarn and 18d. per piece in shirtings-they think that the present experi. ment wgill, like that, probably break dowfn, and that it wiul ultimately be found that the extent of consumption is a question of p rice. They look upon the opening of the pro. sertyear, therefore, as commercially one of danger and difficulty, which wil require munch caution in dealing with.
BIRMINGHAM, Jm. 24.
The attendance at the meetings of ironmasters held at Wolverharnpton and Birmingham on Wednesday and Thursday last was not numerous; but, the ex:itement which to some extent usually prevails at the quarterly meetings having subsided, the exact position of the trade can now be more clearly ascertained than was possible four or five weeks ago. The orders for the United States and the Canadas continue to flow in steadily; and the exports to the continent of Europe are described to be decidedly on the increase. Prices are maintained with great firmuess, aid the tendency is stiU further upwards.
The coal business in all parts of the district continues remarkably brisk, but competition and the contemplated opening of new pits upon Cannock Chase prevent any advance in price.
The tin ware manufacture continues to bo greatly damaged by the repeated advances which have recently taken place in the prices of plates and blocks. This morning it was stated that tin was at 1401. and 1441. per ton, and some manufacturers believe that the rise will not stop until it reaches 1801. per ton. But, notwithstanding material is scarce and proportionably dearer, manufacturers make no complaint oE a falling off in the home or in some foreign markets, but they are unable to obtain the profits which they made a few years age. Several of the largest establish. ments are actively employed in the production of the best deseriptions of tin wares.
Metals generally woulid appear to bo on the advance. Yesterday a rise of Id. per lb. upon copper and 4d. per lb. upon brass was announced by most of the copper rerchauts and manufacturers of copper and brass goods. This advance comes at a very inopportune moment. The factort' lists had recently been selected according to the last advance ; prices were steadily maintained, brass foundry was generally improving, and all appearances promised a good summer trade. It is feared that the decision of the smelters, under these circumstances, wiU operate injuriously, if it does not produce slackness in the manufacture. At present the cabinet branch is busy, and generally there is a good demaud for articles of domestic use, and also for gas fittings and aU descriptions of tubes for tho foreign trade. Large shipments of these articles have lately been made to South Amorica, and also to the East Indies.
The various trades of the town and neighbourhood have presented few points worthy of special observation. The men employed in some branches complain of shortness of work, although not total want of employment; but in the great majority of branches the shops are well employed. The fire-iron business is brisker, and the die sinkers, for the most part, are actively engaged. This is a good indication of the well-doing of other branches dependent u,pon their work. The hollow ware trade is active, and, from appearances, the edged tool manufacture is more than usually thriving. AU businesses, however, connected with the leather trade-and there are many in Birminghamn-are iujuriously affected by the repeated advances which have taken placo in the prices of hides. Tho most senous consequences have befaUen the saddlers and saddlers' ironmongers from this cause. During the last week large orders for these descriptions of goods, which were required for exportation, have been tendered to the-saddlers' ironmongers and whipmakers of Birmingham, but, in consequence of the present dearness of materials iand threatened further advances, the tendered contracts have been rejected. It is anticipated that should the present high price of skins and hides be maintained an immense tLumber of hands mnst be thrown out of employment.
At a meeting of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce held on Wednesday last, it was resolved to join with other towns in an attempt to obtain a reform of the present bankrupt laws.
The affairs of Messrs. Parley and Turner, of the Kidderminster Old Bank, now engage the special attention of the creditors. The following is the statement of Mr. Settle, the accountant, employed by that body:-

NOTTINGHAM, JAS. 24.
The active demand for framiework-knitted goods for the home trade continues. All articles are going off as rapidly as they can be produced. Stocks which had been accumulating before Christmas are quite cleared out, and the warehonses probably never were so bare as at the presena mroment. Workpeople require full prices for msaking all qualities of goods, and this, coupled with the high price of yarns, enhances tho cost very materially. Nevertheless goods sell freely at the advanced rates, and there is no com: ! plaint of lack of business in any hosiery or glovo branch, or
in any of the numerous other branches of framework. knittirn industry. Spinners are now quite firm at the advanced rates, and merino-spinners have given notice of a farther advance to take pla,e on Monday next. The probabilities arc, therefore, that goods will continue to increase in price as the season advances.
A few home trade buyers have visited tho laco-market this week, operating to a fair extent for the spring. There is every prospect of a good demand as the new year progresses. Material is very high, and goods are deater.
LElCESTER, I-.A. 24.
The hosery trade continues w uithout change. Yarns are again advancing, but manufacturers demuar in purchasing at such high rates. The wool-market is firm, with a tendency decidedly upwards. At present the high price of material gives a checkc to business.
There has been a good steady business in the woollen trade botlh at the warebonses and In the public markets. and the demand, which is increasing with the approach of spring, keops close pace with tho supDly. In tele clothballs this morning an active spirit was exhibited, and there were inquiries for light fabrics suited for the warmer season of the year. Of other and more heavy cloths there was a good sale, considering the quantity brought to market. The manufacturers throughout the district arc well employed ard some mills are working over time. Wool still creeps upward.
HALIFAX2, JN. 24.
The manufacturers here, both of worsted goDds and carpets, are moderately well employed, and there is a fair seasonable demand for goods. To-day's market for wool, worsted, andyarnhasbeenrratherquiet, with pricesveryfirm. The high prico of wool is neceseitating an advance on yarns and pieces, which is not yielded without a struggle betiveen th yers and the producers.
BRADFORD, JAt?x. 24.
In the Worsted trade there is a fair amount of business. Transactions in combing wools aro about as active as last noted, the high prices demanded with firmness by staplers acting as a barrier to more extended operations. The supply for the time of year is tolerably good, but there is little arriving at market. There is more request for low qualities of foreign wool at slightly enhanced rates. Noils and short wools are in limited supply, and command good prices.
The yarn department does not yet prosent much improvement. Prices of worsted yarns are maintained; there is a fair demand for some numbers of Coburg yarns for home use. The export houses come forward pretty freely with offers, but the extent of their figures will not cover the cost of production to the spinner.
Cotton warps in most instances rnlo rather highor; but much caution is evinced in operations,
In the piece trado bigher rates are imperatively demanded by manufacturers, who are placed in a position of much discouragement bythe high rates of the raw material. The principal demand is for the home trade and shipment to the
Uited States. Manufacturers, as well a spinnors, con-
tinuevworking out orders, and enter into fresh contracts wvith considerable diflidence.
At a meeting of tho boot and shoo manufactuters it was agreed that, as the pricoe of leather has gradually advanced from 70 tol00per cent., a oorreponding enhancement must as a consequence take place in tho pnce of the manufactured article. A scale of prices was submitted and adopted as a amizimtsm rate at tho present prico of leather. A deputation was appointed to wait upon the trade unable to attend, and to obtain their approval of the resolution unarlimouely agreed to.

The Diplomatic Disservice.
THE DIPLOMiXATIC DISSERYICE.
(From the Ezamin72cr.)
What would bc the effect of abolishingthe diplomatic disservice? . ot any immediately perceptible good, for the diplomatic disservice has created and has on hand a stock of perplexities anm troubles w hich will last for a dozen years to come. But at tho eud of that time, if the diplomatic disservice were now swept away, England vrould doubtless begin to feel the borefit of a good understanding and audity with foreign nations. While tho diplomatic disservice exists it will always be cultivating siccessioni crops of strife. No sooner do we get nd of one ugly question than another rises, and another and another, withot,t end.
Swift says that " a bee is not busier than a blockhead ," sailors say " As active as the Devil in a gale of wind ;" but there seems to us to be no industry in the way of risohief superior to that of the member of the diplomatic disservice. le has great forecast he takes strife; as we are counmselled to take Time, by the forelock, He prepares matter of dissension with the forethought of the ant. He hoards it, lays it up in store for occasion. The public does not sea wvhat he is about till it finds itself in the mess past extrication. The differences with America have pnseil awtay, aud been succeeded by the differences with Persia, and wheneer they too are disposed of other differences il break out in some unexpected quarter, where the diplomatic disservice is now, unseen, undermining the peace of nations.
Protection is the great means of offence delighted in by the diplomatic disservice. We are always getting into quarrels by protecting sowmebody. Wo were nearly involved in war with the United States by protecting those dear Mosquitoes. We are now at loggerheads with Persia to protect Herat and the precious Affghans - but, above all, to protect Mfrs. Hashem. WeU might Sydney Smith say he was weary of protecting, worn down by defending all the world.
The Persian quarrel is a fine example of the working of the diplomatic disservice. The Zdi sbiurh Reviccw has put forth a defence of it which is in effect the most substantial condemnation. To make all the mischief was ciore than one man's work. It required not less than three artificers to perfect the present embroilment. Colonel Shiel began the work witth the convention (we stop not to question the big word for so slight an engagement) bindinsPersia not to send troops to Elerat, except when that bone of contention should be attacked by foreign troops, in which case the Persians were to retire upon the retreat of the other enemy, pari possu. The treaty was a sort of paraphrase of the old song, "1 Do as the company do." Persia was to do as the enemy did. She was to come and go with. any other invader. Herat was by Colonel Shiel made to serve like the boots of Bombastes Farioso, which that hero hangs up with the notice-
Whoever does these boots displace "Must meet Bgmbastos face to face
"If youtouch Herat," said Colonel Shiel, "nay, if you do but look at ber in a hostile way, woe betide, for yon will have to do with aveRging England." Bet the convention of
Herat, preposterous as it was, was nteog oisr
quarrel and mischief. Mhr. Thomson Colonel Shiel's
successor, had a finger in the pie. APrinpic hadl Posssson ofthe house of a niaturlzdBiis njcone
Abdool Kurreeumi, and had an insupherble sion to the ceremony of paying rent. Be would neither pa nor o. Here was a fine case for protection. Was it to be borne that Abdool Kurreem, a British subject, should be cheated of his rent? Forbid it, the honour of England The great house question arose. Mr. Thomson took the law into his own hands, says the Edinburgh Rcs'iw, and directed , forcible ejectment. What MIr. Thomson took into his own hands does not seem to us to be in the least like law, but a violence against all law. Suppose a French subject in London to be the owner of a house occupied by a prince who has a decided objection to paying rent, and we have had Royal dukes in our tine influenced strongly bv that anipathy, in *commemoration of which a column has been raLsed as high as the debts left behind one of them. Well, what would be thought of the French Ambassador if he were to send a pack of servants to turn his Royal Highness out of his house by forc of arms? "Oh," we shall be told "the rules of civilized nations do not apply to a state of things like that of Persia." But when the Persian AMinister threatens to lay hold of Mr. Hashem, appointed to a British mission at Shiraz, the law of nations is invoked against the proposed volence. And so it is that we play fast aand loose wth the laws of nations, holding them binding when they are on our side, and null when against us. A European Power in the case of Mr. Hashern would have refused to grant him an xco uatur, and the appointment would thus have been void. 'Cho seqcuel of the great house question was, that the heroes of the British Embassy were ignominiously expeUed and routed by the superannuated women of some harems let loose against them. So neither the rent was got in by tho English Minister's levy, nor the house rcstored.to the worthy Abdool Kurreem. The only consequence was ill blood on both sides, the bringing about of which is the businems of the diplomatic disservice.
The complcation has now nmade fine progress. Colonel Shiel has created the Herat question, Mr. Thomson has followed with the great honse-rent question, and third comes Mfr. Murray, with the Hashem question. At Herat Great Britain plays the part of a protector; in the great house-rent question she figures as a bailiff taking possession ; in the Hashem affair her part is more equivocal, and nob easy to describe. There was a lady in the case, and, in defat of getting hold of Mr. Hashem, the Shah laid hold of Mrs. Hashem, and justified the act by imputing something very pawpaw to Mr. Murray. The cnmson blushes of the Britis flag, whose modesty was thus outra&ed, were too painful to be borne ; down it went in a fit of dis-
leasure, and Mr. Murray, in the touching language of the EZdiauurgh .Revic'o, " set his face tovards Turkey." Of the merts of this great question, so far as Mrs. Eashem is concerned, we know nothing, but as regards her worthy mate we have our mistrust, for it may almost uniformly be observed that the diplomatic disservice has a decided predilection for foreign scamps, who come to it for patronage and protection when they have outraged the laws of their own country, and been cast off by those who have the best means of judging of their characters and conduct.
Now, let it be considered with sorrow how much more satisfactory our relations or no-relations with Persia would be if there had been no members of the diplomatic dissorvice to meddle and make-no Shiel to guard Herat to such purpose as to brin- about its present capture; no Thomson to recover a Sebt for house-rent, or in default to take possession like a broker's man ; no 'Murray to vindicate the great cause of Mr. and mrs. Mashem. How curiously each oi these gentlemen has done his worst ! If Colonel Shiel had mado a convention vith the ShaLr, stringently stipulating for his making the conquest of Herat forthwvith at his own chargo, not a finger would that potentate havo moved against the filthiest of Eastern cities. A thousand reasons, a thousand pleas of impossibility, would have been found for not performing the cngagenient. Merat would have been firmly secured against Persiant hostilities by Persian bad faith. It would have been enough that the thing was conditioned for in a treaty to insure its never being executed. By the contrary courso, by throwing paper engagements around Herat, Colonel Shicl mado the placo Rppear of the most transcendant importance to the Persians, aid an object of desire to be attainecd even at the unwonted price of some energy and exertion.
Mr. Thomson has been a square peg ia a round hole. There was a plnce for a man of his special aptitude, but it was not at Teheran. There is in London a society for the recovery of debts, to whom the service of Mr. Thomson would have been invaluable in summary process of entry and ouster, always barring the intervention of old women
to beat off his bailiffs.
Mr. Murray's quarrel we like best as a matter of taste. if we are to have a war lot it be for a Helen rather than for a dirty city or a paltry ejeetment. The Hashem war will be a fine title for history, aand subject for an epic, Murray's wrath standing in place of that of AchiUles in the Itiad.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMS.
Sir,-May I venture again to trespass on your space to say, in reply to your correspondent "J. A.," of to.day, Ithat the subject of the entire removal of tho prison of Newgate to Holloway has been under tho consideration of the Caol Committee of the Conrt of Aldermen? After a most anxious investigation of aU the reqnirements of such * prisonx as Newgate, where the varied criminals of four counties are awaiting trial, we camo to the conclusion (with, I believe, only one dissentient, Mr. Alderman Sidney) that it was absolutely necessary that the prison should be in communication with the Central Criminal Courts.
I may also state that the entire reconstruction of the interior of Newgate, retaining the external walls, which are admitted to be the finest specimen of prison architecture in the country, will not amount to half tho sum named by your correspondent " J. A.;" there is ample space available for every possible requiremont.
I would just add, in conclusion, that tho subject of the entire reconstruction and remodeling of the Central Criminal Courts is now under the consideration of a committee of the corporation, and we hope to got their authority to carry out the proposed improvements, in conjunction with the contemplated alterations of Newgate.
I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant.

Sir,-Though nowise concerned in the inatterof the for'eign excbanges, I thinak I may remove "'Dunce's" difficulty regardiny the rLbeijumu on gold in Paris. HEe sayg, "An ouneo of gol d bullon Must alwaYs be worth anouc'f l bxlin"True,I if bo-th ounces are in tho samoplace,Cut
probably untrue if the One ounce is in London anX the otber in Paris.
Suppose a trader in Tondon had to pay 1,000 sovereigns in PaLris, and, finding it a trouble and an expense to transmit
the gold, should purchase a bill of exchange', layable ia Paris (at sight), fo r that amount. Now, if the domana for gold in Paris happened at such time to be somewhat keener than it was in London, the trader would fmin that he mus,t Pay for such bill somaething more than the 1,000 sovereigns, and that something would constitute the premium in question ; while, bad the demand been greater in london, he would have obtained the bill for something less than the 1,C00 sovereigns, and ths lhe would live got a premium instead of paying one.
To adopt, "1Dunce's" forinicia)-Let % represent 1,0(X) sovereipns (practically, 2'50o0L of fine gold), and p repreF.ent 6 sovereigns. Then, 'when gold in Paris bears mule prenium as compared to gold inL London, uz+y in LondonL will be only equal to a in Paris. A. trader in Londoni, therefore, wisbing to enable his oorrespondent in Paris to receive 1,000 sovereigns (or 25Oor- of fine gold) 'wil have to pay 1,0D61. (sovereigns) in Londoni for a suitable bil upon Paris.
I am, Sir, yours repetfully.

London, Monday, January 26, 1857.
I LORDWON, AUODA Y,I JAYUARBY 26, 1857.
By telegraphic despatch we learn that the Island of Karrack, in.the Persian Gulf, was occupied on December 4, and that Bushire surrendered on the 9th, after four houle' fire from the fleet, without a single casualty on our side. The fort of
Bushire had been captured on the previous day. In the action Brigadier STOPFOBD and three other offlcers were kiUed, one officer was wounded, and the force lost besides about 20 rank and file. The absence of details makes it impossible to express well grounded opinions on this, the first operation of the war ; but it seems that both the runours prevalent beforehand were without foundation. Bushire could neither have been abaudoned, nor, on the other hand, defended by a large Persian arniy. The garrison had, no doubt, been reinforced, and the works of the town strengthened to receive us. But the issue of the contest could not be doubtful. The island and port which were the first objects of the expedition fell at once into the hands of the British.
The news received through Vienna that the Persian authorities had, on the fall of Bushire, accepted the conditions of the British Government, though published as authentic on Saturday, seems somewhat untrustworthy. It maybe that tbe conditions of surrender have been confounded with some general conditions of peace. It is difficult, indeed, to see how there could have been at Bushire any one on either side competent to treat on so important a subject. And as to the Court of Teheran having been affected by the intelligence so as to make its submission, we cannot understand how the news of this decision should reach England contemporaneously with the news of the event which caused it. Bushire is 500 milesfromTeheran, andthe communication between them is by no means rapid. We may also doubt that the Persians should make their submission on the occurrence of what they must have known was an inevitable event. No counsellor of the SHAHi, native or foreign, could have given him any hope of successfully opposing the English landing. If there be any truth in the reports of hiis determination to resist he must have counted on the ulterior difficulties of the enterprise-the pestilential climate of the Gulf, the passes to be traversed before Shiraz or Ispahan can be reached, and the hundreds of miles of desert which separate us from the city which is the alleged cause of the confLict. Therefore, though we shall be glad to hear any confirmation of the news that the Persian Government has succumbed, we think it better to regard it at present as a perversion of the merely military surrender of the fort and town.
There is better reason, however, to hope for the termination of this miserable dispute. If it be true that the Persian Court, drawing its intelligence from St. Petersburg, and inspired with additional reverence by the fall of Kuar, formed a low estimate of the power of England, the Ambassador FER11U KHAN will have an opportunity of undeceiving his master. He has already arrived in Paris, where the EmcrnoR has addressed him in a speech expressing his extrems regret that there should be war between us. Now, although we think it would be both inipolitic and undignified on our part to accept anything like mediation between ourselves and an Eastern State, we can have no objection to the Persian Envoy learning from foreign Courts what opinion is formed of the contest in which his Sovereign is engaged. The folly of attempting to withstand such a Power as England will, no doubt, be made clear to the understanding of the Ambassador. He will perceive that it is to the advantage of Persia to make peace at once, before things become really serious, before a great war has been entered upon, and the loss of troops and money provokes the British nation to further demands. The question is to us one of loss or gain; to the Persian empire it is one of safety. If the war be continued, we know the consequences. WVe shaU lose several scores of brave officers aund many hundreds of men by heat or sickness, or fatigue or the sword of the enemy. We shall embarrass the resources of India for years, check improvements, hamper commerce, delay the schemes for canals and railways, cottonplanting and tea-planting, perhaps keep up the Income-tax at home, and postpone for a period the removal of other financial burdens. But of the issue of the conflict there can be no doubt. That the Persian Government should believe in the power of Russia to help it is not wonderful, when even in Europe similar illusions prevail. In spite of the events of the last war, which showed Russian armies unable to prevail against halfdisciplined foes on the Danube and in Armenia, in spite of the acknowledged exhaustion of the empire, and its inability to obtain funds even for industrial undertakings, there are persons who affect to believe in a Russian march of 1,000 miles, from Georgia to Herat, or another less in length, but even greater in difficulty, to the shores of the Persian Gulf. A little communication with sensible men will show even au Oriental diplomatist the folly of such expectations, and we cannot doubt that either in person or by his influence on the Court he represents FxR-ux KMAN wiU aid in bringing the quarrel to a close.
Yet, whatever may be in store, the public wiU learn with satisfaction that the first success has been easily won. We have, indeed, to regret the loss of four officers kiled-an unusually large proportion to 20 men kiled andwounded. Brigadlier STOPFORD was a veteran in Eastern war, for he had been in Affghanistan in 1841-2, and had commanded his regiment, the 64th, at Maharajpore. The other three officers were in the Company's service. The country has now been long enough at peace to feel . the old thril of interest and regret at the fate of men who fll gallantly in action. The prolonged conifict before Sebastopol had somewhat blunted this sensibility. The news of the slaughter at the Redan produced no such excitement as the list of the killed and woinded at Alna or Balaklava. But now a sea attack, a landing, a battle, and a 'Victory, bought by the death of gallant soldiers, once more have the force of novelty in inspiring pride and pity. Mlay this be the last blood shed, and may this success enable us to settle our differences with a semi-barbarous potentate without recourse to a gigantic enterprise, which can only add barren provinces to our sway, or iUustrate our annals with fruitless victories, while it will delay for many years the development and civilization of the great empire which England has already conquered!

We have no wish to undervalue Mr. ROEBUCK'S
We have no wish to indervalue Mfr. RoBBuczes part ; on the contrary, we hold that it is a part, a legitimate part, and a peculiar one. The censor morum is everywhere, and always has been, though in order to obtain a hearing he has put on many disguises. He must be all things against all men. At one time he put on goatskins, danced on a waggon, and sang satirical verses. Then he lived in a tub, went into the market-place with a lantern, and gave monarchs short answers. Then he would philosophize, confute everybcdy out of his own mouth, put complacency to shame, and send wisdom a-begging. Anon, in a sudden access of indignation, he would betake himself to a cave, fRing, away his city clothes, and live on roots and herbs, in order to die protesting against all hUman contrivances. Then, as circumstances chaiged, he would retire to a wilderness, live on nature's rudest gifts, and denounce the fraud and violence practised in the pursuit of more. Then he would scoop for himself a hole out of the rock, or preach night and day from the top of a lofty column. But, not wholly to forsake the Court, he would there put on motley, and with savage humour cut and cauterize kings, courtiers, prelates, and everything that crosed him. It is the loftier and more
heroic of these metamorphoses that Mr. RoEntru undertakes, though not the less cynical. His speeches are addressed to al classes, and are a sort of Lent sermon-an exercise of mortification. If we want to be profoundly uncomfortable, or if, being uncomfortable, we want to improve the occasion, we have only to turn back to the member for Sheffield's last appearanee in public. There are looking-glasses that flatter, that warm the complexion, fill up the wrinkles, round the short points, and throw a haze of purple youth over the most time-scarred features. There are others, grimly honest and gloomily true, that give you a map of your physiognomy fit for the most Ecientific purposes. Mr. ROEBScK is a mirror of the truth-telling and incorruptible class. A faded belle would break him to pieces, or banish him from her toilet-table, but she would lose a useful monitor. His portraits are daguerreotypes. .Sorem. quis dicere falsum aud.eat ? But, after all, sunpainting is a very chymical sort of invention, and the result bears traces of the metals and acids through which it has passed. You are shown true enough, no doubt,-only too true,-but in your worst condition and your sourest mood. The salon of the daguerreotypist is the cave of TRopno.ius, and you emerge from it, perhaps, a wiser and a better, but certainly a sadder man. Mr. ROEBUCK turns out his portraits with much the same ugly, sinister, ticket-of-leave expression. You are stiUl at large, it is true, but only on sufferance; and if you should faU into the clutches of the police they will swear to a man that thoy all know you well.
Everybody comes in for it in his turn-nay, even in her turn, too, for the fair sex is not excluded from this gallery. Let us see. One can hardly find a character omitted. Here are 3Iinisters, headed by the PRIME MrXISTER and his vwifo, in one picture. They are made rather fine people, but politic as weU as fastidious. Then there is more than one portrait of a lord as an empty jackanapes, fresh from Colege or his mamma's drawingroom, stratting up to the House and made a great man at once. After this, who would be a young lord ? But the vis-'-ris of this portrait is even less complimentary. It is that of a sturdy, well-to-do, well-going, honest man, who has made his way in the world, bowing down to the very ground, crawling " upon his very bely," before a noble scion, a little petty creature, who hardly Lnows his right hand from his left, and whose only recommendation is that he signs his name without his Christian name. Why, of the two, we would rather be the little lord than the big manufacturer, who strikes one as being moraUy the less of the two. The former struts, and the latter crawls. Then, there is not only the vulgar fellow, but his still more vulgar wife, who has set her heart on going to the QuTzEN's ball. There is Captain SO-AND-SO, in a handsome uniform, and a crowd of women running after him, like turtles snapping at a rag of red cloth. There is a group of the destitute aristocracy taking refuge in the army. There is a contractor vith two sets of samples, and a handsome fee in his pocket for the official who lets him pam off the one for the other. There is the taxgatherer, who somehow is always a rich man, but who can only grow rich by the roguery of the taxpayer. There is the rich political economist, who is very tender en the subject of property, particularly that in the funds, and who has a growing dislike of Radical Reformers. A pair of pictuires gives us on the one sidle a rough weatherbeaten Admiral of the old school, with a touch of the skipper about him, and the fine gentleman who walks the quarter-deck when the weather is fine. Two groups of smaller functionaries are the one for parade and the other for service. The painter, true to his art, is so fair to aU sides that one sometimes suspects a lurking preference for the side of the seducer rather than the seduced. Liverpool itself comes off the worst of all, because the censure is there more fixed and localized. When a great man condescends to speak of a small man he always calls hin "good man,' or "good gentle" man," or by some such homely phrase. In this way Mr. Roznucx speaks of the " good town of " Liverpool," and he observes " that there is a "wonderful desire in the princely merchants of "this princely town to be thought fine gentlemen "in the House." What folows, however, seems to indicate the point of view from which Mr. RoErcux is wont to regard this very usual ambition :-" If they could only hear the sort of criti"cism and sarcasm that folows their own indivi"dual debasement, I think they would be prouder "of their position as independent men than sub" servient followers." This is very severe. Mr. RoEnucK tels the Liverpool merchants that they are not only sneaks-what is worse, they are snobs.
This may be all very true; but, then, why should truth be so disgusting ? Some one said that if Truth should ever show herself all men would love her. That cannot be said for Air. RoB1uCK's revelation of this much-desired personage. The fact is, he is rather too anatomical in his drawing. He is like the mad painter whose friends had to convey away his pictures before he could finish them, as he always finished by turning his figures into skeletons. He discloses the machinery of life rather too rudely. Besides, there is a great mixture of human motives, and a fair side as well as a foul side of most human characters. The Liverpool Financial Reformers and the London Administrative Reformers wil have to begin their work very early if they would hope to mend the universal disorder of which Mr. RoEnucK has given us so accurate a diagnosis. Go to any juvenile party ; there, sitting demurely in a corner, you will see a little girl, or may be a little boy, looking as well-behaved, as wise, as prudent, as trathful, as independent, and as selfsatisfied, as any cynic could desire. In another part of the roolm is a group as wild, as thoughtless, as reckless, as roguish, as impudent, as incapable of control, and as little to be trusted, as a cynic would also wish for the purpose of censure. The former of ihese is that solitary Truth, that voice crying in the desert, or more usually holding its tongue altogether, that the cynic himself represents. The latter is the world, society, or whatever else it may be caUed, and it has gifts
and graces of its own, its own smiles and charms, its wit and eloquence, and its larger share of this world's good things. Let theworthy cynic's own well-taught, well-disciplined child, enter the room, and ten to one she vill leave incorruptible Integrity sitting in the corner, and plunge at once into the gay throng, frisking and flirting in a cloud of wreaths, and ribands, and ropes. If she sees a little friend of hers among them she wil instinctively avail herself of the introduction, give herself to the stream, and take folly as it comes, without much ado. MIr. RoEDnUvu may depend on it all the personages in his gallery of portraits are now very much what they were 30 years ago, at school, and even in the nursery. If they are tuft-hunters now, they very early showed a predilection for any bit of nobility or simple gentility that came in their way. If they are trying to make their way by trickery instead of fair dealing, depend on it they begin with overruling their xchoolfellows or their own brothers. It is not British society, which we will fondly hope is not worse thsn the average of nations, that is in error,-there is something wrong in human nature itself, And the disease lies at the common root of axl societies, all institutions' al classes, all nations. So what is to be. done? The question in the present instance is rather of Mr. Ropsuuo's puitting than ours, so we invite him to answer it. He has
put all England on its trial, and pronounced an adverse verdict. What xentence will he pass? Wbat penal settlement-what reformatory-what penitentiary-what work-what discipline has he for a whole nation of offenders? The answer is past our skilL MIr. ROEBUCK is bound to guide us out of the labyrinth in which he has entangled us.

The oscillations of the needle in the War Income-
The oscillations of the needle in the War Incometax question are beginning to yield to the strong attraction of the year 1858, and show evident signs of settling down at that point in the compass. The Government, as the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEEQUER informs us, is too liberal to take advantage of the technical quibble which enables it legally to postpone the reduction of the tax another year. " Nothing wiUl turn upon the pre" cise wording of the act," and the necessities of the country, and not the letter of the law, wiU be its guide on the financial question. This is liberal, though it is a piece of liberality which could not wel be avoided. Parliament could not, of course, be forced by the letter of an aet of its own making to continue an augmented tax a year beyond the time at whieh it deliberately chose and intended it should expire, for the same authority that made an act can unmake it. The liberality, then, of not insisting on the " precise " wording of the act" is imposed upon Government by the simple logic of the case, and is not strictly optional. On the other hand, however, the C1rwCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER shows a certain inclination, not unnatural to his position, to keep sight of this very letter of the law, and the letter has its charms ; it is a consolatory memento to turn to ; he does not like wholy withdrawing from it, urnhooring his vessel, and committing himself without a salvo to the sea of financial discussion upon the simple merits of the question. WVhile there is no intention to make use of the wording of the act we are reminded that this wording " was no mis"take ;" that it was quite " correct;' that the "proper term to use is the ' ratification,' and not
the ' signature' of a treaty." The letter of the act is thus kept as a slight convenient intrenchment in the distance, not for the purpose of actually retiring behind it, because that would be iUiberal and cowardly, but rather for the purpose of pointing to and producing the impression on the enemy that you might take advantage of its protection if you liked, and that therefore he must not push you too far. The letter of the act thus becomes useful by not being formally used, and advantageous by no advantage being taken of it, and under the cover of a total disclaimer is made to render a delicate and insensible assistance to the embarrassed financier.
With respect to this single year's additional continuance of the War Income-tax, it is not perhaps worth while, under aU the circumstances, to fight against our destiny. It is no particular consolation, indeed, to be told that if it is continued it will be continued, not on account of the act, but because the money is wanted. This is, we believe, generally the reason why all taxes are imposed. Nobody in his senses imagines Governments to be lovers of taxation for its own sake, and the CHiACELLOR of the EXCREQUIER need not have given himself the trouble to disclaim this disinterested passion on behalf of Lord PAUNRsroS's Government. Everybody, high and low, will give them full credit for the real motive. Even CHArtims II. and Louis XIV. had no other motive in taxing their subjects than wanting the money, and, if they had so reasonable an object, who would think of accusing the present Administration of laying on taxes with a view to popular tortue ? It is no great consolation, then, we say, to the objectors to the Income-tax to be told that this is the reason why it is to be continued. At the same time, if the reason is a true one, if the money is wanted-and nobody seems to dispute the fact,the reason must be allowed to have some weight. It is the rule of the House of Commons, we are told, to find out what the expenditure of the nation is, and to lay on taxes accordingly. This is what Government intend to do in the present case. The nation has spent the nioney, and the only question is how it is to tax itself to pay the debt it has incurred. Is it to be in the shape of another year's augmented Income-tax, or in any other shape ? The deputation to the CHIAuCELLoR of the ExCIIEQUER think, perhaps, that any other tax will be preferable to this augmentation of the Income-tax. But a distinction should be drawn here. However objectionable the Income-tax may be, it is evident that the objections lie against the tax itself, and not against any particular augmentation of it, and that they apply just as much to an Income-tax which takes Zd. out of the pound as to one which takes 16d. But, with respect to the tax itself, we cannot help ourselves-we are certainly saddled with it for the next three years. The relief from the War Income-tax, then, for one year sooner would only be a relief from the augmentation of the tax, not from the tax; it would only affect the production of the tax-it would not touch the character of the tax itself. The machinery of the Income-tax would go on all the same whether it raised 7d. or lGd. in the pound; it would be just as inquisitorial, just as partial, just as trying to men's consciences, just as provocative of evasion. It is not the amount, but the nature of the tax, which condemns it.
But if the fact that we arc any how saddled with the tax for the next three years makes us sul)mit more patiently to one year's further infliction of the augmented tax, the argument recoils with so much the greater force upoii the tax itself. Governments should reaUy understand now that we want to get rid of this tax, and that we expect to do so as soon as the general act expires. It has been continued and continued time after time, tiU at last it has almost threatened a permanent residence, but it is quite evident that the more we have of it the worse we like it. There are certain classes of burdens that grow with familiarity and use; we never get accustomed to ihem; time, the universal harmonizer and soother, only developes their vexatiousness; they are more difficult to bear the longer we bear them. The public is now beginning to feel the Incometax cramp, and the kicking and stamping which we hcar on aU sides of us are only the efforts of nature to throw off the tormentor. It is simply the question now whether the public are to give way to our Chancellors of the Exchequer, or our Chancellors of the Exchequer to the public. The financier, of course, likes tho Incometax, it is so simple and so summary an engine ; it gives him so easy a grasp over the national purse; he has only t squeeze the orange, and out the juice comes. But the instrument which is so convenient to the
taxer is a niost awkward one to the taxed. We are told in plain words by its very imposers that this tax cannot be made just,-that it cannot take account of the most broad distinctions in the nature of incomes. Mr. DIsn&ELm's abortive budget attempted to grapple with this difficulty, and the effort was condemned by Mr. GLADsToNE as unpractical, because it would be impossible to carry out such distinctions in the actual worling of the tax, whieh -was to say that the efficiency of the tax depended upon its injustice. But a tax which must be anjust, and must be inquisitorial, cannot and ought not to be permanent.

There are certain points of practice upon which
There are certain points of practice upon wIhic
only a nillionairo can venture. An ordinary mortal muast pay his bills, or be esteemed a rascal;
if he have borvred a sovereign from a friend upon a railroad emergenev, he must absolutely return the coin. Nobody will give the "poor " devil" cradit for a short memory. He is not overwhelmed with the extent or weight of his pecuniary affairs; it is impossible he could have forgotten the debt. But once let a man be a great lord, or have 30,0001., and it is astonishing to what depths of meanness he can descend w ith impunity. He may content himself with the worst inn's worst room; against his economy there is not a word to say, for a man, be he prince, peer, or potboy, has as good right to sleep in a garret as on a finrt-floor. A poor man, however, murt keep up appearancet. This, indeed, is a legitimate advantage of position; but what if the millionaire on the strength of his millions refuses to pay for the use of the garret, and, rather than disburse the Is. 3d. due, provokes the intervention of a court of law? It was notorious that one of the wealthiest of England's wealthy peers never would pay a debt until a writ had been issued against him for the amount. The existence of the means of payment seems to exclude all necersity for the performance of the obligation. A most notable illustration of this doctrine may be found in our impression of Saturday last. Mr. HANCOCr, the well-known jeweller of Bond-street, had supplied Lord ERNEST VA_N7E TnSPEsT, the youngest son of the late Lord LON DONDRY, with jewelry to a small amount. The tr actions had been spread over a period extending from September 1, 1854, to MIay 11, 1855. The whole amount of the claim was the trifling sum of 1501. 19s.-we say the "trifling" sum, when the socialpositionof the defendant and the notorious and enormous wealth of hisi mother are taken into account. The plea for the defence was " infancy ;" the replication, as it is technically cealld, on Mr. HANCOCK'S behalf, was that the articles supplied were what is legally styled " necessaries." The term, of course, must not be taken in its usual sense ; " neces" saries" in the eye of the law vary according to the rank in life and circumstances of the individual. It would have been monstrous had s fashionable jeweller been permitted to recover even such an amount as the one claimed in the case which we are considering against the son of a Welsh curate, not being of age. It would have been equaUy preposterous, had Mr. HANcOCK given credit to Lord ERNEST VAN-E TErPEST, a minor, for jewelry to the value of 50,0001., that he should have sought redress in a court of justice. The law, however, is happily clear enough upon this point to enable a judge to give such directions to a jury that substantial redress, in all proper cases, is easily to be attained by the tradesman who has been victimized. Mr. EDWIN JAMES, in opening the case to the jury, stated the law upon the point to be as folows -
"iAll such articles as are purely ornamental are not necessaries, and for such things an infant cannot be miade responsible. But if they are not strictly of this description then the question arises whether they were bought for tho necessary use of the party in order to support himself in the degree, state, and station of life in which he moved; if they were, the plaintiff may be made responsible."
That is the rule of law, and we quote the words of the learned counsel here because it may be of profit to various young gentlemen now moving in fashionable society to be made aware that, all " infants" as they are, they cannot hope to bilk their tradesmen with impunity.
It may afford some little amusement to our readers if we particularize a few of the articles included in Mr. HANCOCK'S bill. First, there was a ruby and diamond ring. The law is precise upon this point. It has been solemnly held by our legal sages that a ring is a " necessary" for a nobleman. The next article was an enamelled hair-locket. Lord ERNEST VANE TEMPEST is evidently a youth of Strephonic tendencies. The learned Judge, Mr. Baron BRAMWELL, inquiredawhat the use of this article might be? He was informed " that it is "what you put a piece of hair in when you are "attached to a young lady." It is with the deepest concern that we record the answer of the judge,-" Then all I can say is, that I have " been without necessaries all my life." Be the case, however, as it may with this learned but unfortunate personage as touching enamelled hair-lockets, we cannot but wonder whether Lord ER-NEST VANE TExPEST stuffed a portion of his own lovely tresses into tbe arsicle in question and then presented it to the lady of his affections; or whether, having surreptitiously obtained possession of one of the silken tangles of NE.ERA'S hair, he inserted it into the locket, and then placed the precious trophy upon his own patrician heart. In either case it was no great compliment to the young lady to refuse payment for the locket. WVe next come upon a pair of onyx sleeve-links at 31., and a set of gold shirt-studs at 21. ; surely these are fairly "necessaries" for a person in the position of Lord ERE:ST VANE TENrPEST. From the description of the next item we may gather an idea of what young officers in the 2d Life Guards consider as necessaries. It appears that in that valuable corps it is reckoned matter of necessity that the officers should have their door latch-keys made of gold. It is the practice of the regiment, and so Lord ERNEST VANE TEMPEST selected Mr. HEACOCK as the victim who M as to supply him gratuitously with the golden means of ingress and egress. After the gold key we find mention of a gold turquoise Alma locket. Let us hope the lady of the enamelled locket-locket No. 1-was better treated than the unfortunate jeweller. Mr. HANCOCK was called upon for some explanation as to these articles, and stated " He made many lockets "for gentlemen to wear. They were worn uext "the heart a good deal." We trust they are generally paid for. Lord ER-NEST VANE TEMPEST seems to have continued his saunter along the mild, moonlit path of sentiment, for he is next charged 71. 7s. for an enamelled pearl chain necklace-a gift, we presume, from the young patrician to one of the objects of his affection, and an unwilling gift from the jeweller to the lord. In reply to Mr. HANCOCW'S claim, Lord ERN-EST VANE TEmPEST, as we have before remarked, pleaded infancy-and his mother, the millionaire MIarchioness, offered 5s. in the pound for her son's debt.
Of the legal liability of the young nobleman there could not be a moment's question, if the delivery of the goods was proved with the precision the law requires. Unfortunately the delivery of but 651. 15s. worth of goods could be proved, as the assistant who had delivered the remainder is now in Egypt. The verdict accordingly was returned for the smaller sum, the jury, however, expressing a strong opinion that the plaintiff ought to have been paid his demand in full. Such must be the opinion of every one who reads the report, and considers the circumstances of the case. We have raised our voices loudly enouqh from time to time against the improper extension of credit by tradesmen to youths who could not in reason be supposed proper persons for trust to any amount. Such cases are constantly curring at the Universities, and they are among the most lamentable which can be imagined. Many a mother's heart has been broken-many a hearth has been darkened-many a sister has remained portionless, tbanks to the credit system which has been pursued with too much success at either University. But what have such casIs in common with a paltry debt contracted by a son of the wealthy Marecionegs of LoNDoNDERiW for articles which were of the full value of the snum
C Irried to account ? His legal advisers very judicio:ily refrained from producing the Youig Hopeful
iV court, or M,*. H=^X;,o wzV.1d have recovered the ftll amount. Is it possiblo that it can be left uinpaid ?

The American Merchant Navy.-A charge
THE AmERticAx MERCHAN,T NAN-Y.--A charge Vras preferred on Friday afternoon at Liverpool before 2,1-. -lansfield, the stipen,diary magistrate, against the first ma's -of the American ship Albert Gallatin, who, it was alleged, -during a voyage from New York to this port, and particu-larly while entering the dockcs on the l1th inst., had treated Wvith considerable brutality three foreigners, named Miuller, Zimmerman, and Ziils, who, it was alleged, had been in-duced to ship on board the vessel by advertisement issued In New York, to the effect that a pasage to Liverpool and $S20 a-month would be given to landsinen andl others, -who would be expected only to Perform landsmen's duty oni -board. As the sumnmonses were confined to the Ilth, the -evidence was also restricted to that day. It appeared that the three men, when the vessel was entering 'he dock, had b3een kicked anld beaten with ropes s3everely by the mate. Mr. A.spinall, barrister, who appeared for the men, comVlained of the apathetic conduct of the American consul in
Lierpool (M.Nathaniel Hawthorne) in regard to this cls fcssin general, and venitured to assert that if thes
repeated Acts of brutality were onLly properly represented to the United States' Governmeont and people the American nation and ineicantile marine would cease to be scandalized by their recurrence. The mate was finedinaone case 5f.anid costs, and in the other two 40s. and costs.
LossE.i OF STEAsMERs.-Within the last few days !ouLr steamers have been lost, three of themnwith sacrifice of life. One of the four, a cargo vessel with auxiliary screw, was an ordinary sea risk, suggesting no considerations but those of thinkfulness that the crew were all saved ; the others, run on shore and wrecked in thy Chiannel, call for serious consideration. If there was blameo in the, orange vessel leet on Tol Pedn Pen with, the parties in fault paid the penalty of tbeir lives, and certainly the masier and mnate appea4 not to hiave known the navigation of the mouth of the ChUtnel. They were probably accustomed to the coast -of Scotland anid 'inexperienced in foreign voyages ; otherwise, how call we explain, what is strange on any stupposi-tion, that after mankinig the Lizard Lights, and determining 'their hearing andI distanco, and afte'r making the Scily tight, they should bo found with the Longship's light on their port bow, mnistaking it for Sdilly, and running on right for destruction? We can understand a steamer running on shore in thick weather which prevented the lights and the land from being seen ; but to ace all the lighits, and run wildly about ev-ery where hut where slie ought to be, does not seem the act of a sailor. In the case of the Tyne, and the still miore lamentabele case of the Violet, there can be no inmvputation on the seamanship, for the officers were confessedly mnost competent. The ships were thle finest of their class and the tracks in which they were running were well known -to those in chbir-ge. There can be no cbarge of incompetency or neglect, and yet the ships were sacrificed, and one of the crews. They kniew where they were. The officers of the Violet evidenitly knew they had run their distance, as appears from the dlirection of the ship's head as she lay on the ,sand; and the officers of the Tyne had seeni Portland light, and knew well the bearing and distance of St. Alb3n'sibead, halfway between Portland and the Needles, and in a -direct line fromis one to the other, In fact, the distance here is so short, and the trick so plain, that one is puzzled to -find an explanation for the accident, unless the a pparent absence of all danger ledi to carelessness, and the helmsnman -received a wrong point from the officer of the watch, or mnistook, or was inattentive to this directioni given him. Aftr all, both these wrecks point to the game general -eause-tbe h-Abitual sacrifice of safety to speed and punctualitY. We must have steam-packets ruijning wi th the certainty of miail coaches on shore, No matter that a Worth Sea hurricane is blowing, andl lhail, sleet, andasnow oin with the darkness of night to obscure the look-out, the Ustend letters must be in London by the morning mails and -the Violet moat risk the passage. No matter that the steamner is near the shore, the weather come on too thick to see either the lanad or vessels in the track,-the Tyne must at ali risks avoid lengthening the passage from the West Indies by an hour or two, To wait for daylight, oir even to -slacken sp 3ed, is not to ha thought of. True, there was no -object to be gained by hurry. She could not deliver her miails or la%nd her passengers one hour the sooner by thus 'Pushing onk; hutt pushing is the rule, and the caution of old 'times is exploded. A few casualties of this kind will tell -upon public opinion), and compel a more cautious and 'prudenit cours. With the rapid increase of our trade, and the still increasing size and speed of clippers and steamers, t'he necessity will be felt of enforcing the needful precautions a;ainst wreck andi oolision. It will be felt necessary 'to avoid as mnuch as possible Channel navigation for such large and rapid ships, for their owna sakes as well as for the sake of the vessels which in their headlong speed through th e darkness they endanger, Casualties like those of t'he last fEew days wil prepnre the puiblic mind, and some awful natastrophe will at last det-ermine it.-R?oyal Cor-zmarll Gazette.
LEGAL FALSEHooDS.-There is one ameondment of -t'he la6w which needs not wait for codification, consolidation, -or change of principle. It is simply top ur.ge our statute. book and practice of direct faleebood. There is no defect in the law so serious, or so calculated to destroy respect, as -the transparent lying which is mnaintained through a blind Aadhrence to custoin, - By a false caution in suLbstituting for -transPortation or convicts penal servitude, or the mnodificd -transportation of the present day, the law with regard to
tsntncsf trasortation remains technically the same while the practice aims altered. The judges are compelled to pronounce the sentence, although it is not to he carried out.
Everybody knows this, When Iledpath, Burgess, and Teater were sentenced to long terms of transportation the prisoners, and everybody en court, knew that it was not intended to transport them for some time to come, and perhaps not at all.'Thie sentences were " humbug," and $hey were known to be such by the prisoners and by those wvhom they ware meant to deter, The breach of truth is douhly sinful when it is also a breach of justice. Perha s -the grossest instance of formalfalsehood, accompanied by t e infliction of personal wrong, isthat fiction of law which makes ithe only reiiiedy for a wrongful conviction pardon. The case -of John Markhbam is the mnoat recent, though far from being alone or beingthe worst. While John Markhamnwaswailkin
in Oxford-street apolimaman tapped him on theshoulderaDnd -arrested hlim on a charge of felony. In his alarm Markham unluckily gave a false name, which probably tended to in. 4crease the difficulty of proving his innocence. Hfewas taken to -the police court, committedi for trial, andl tried, in company
'with Attwel), as Jamnes Anderson1, non of the persons im,plica tedi Saward's bank forgeries. Witnesses swore to
hi detty; the jury convicted him ; he was sentenced to fou .yar of I enal servitude, and actually sent to prison as a convict. He had been obliged to part with everythiing tec possessed for his defence; his wife was reduced to esxtreinest destitution ; his health has been entirely brokcen. At last it is discovered that John Markhami is not Jamnes Anderson, The whole treatmnent of the man has been a -mlis'take; so nowr, "1with the consent of Mr. Mlullens on the moart of the bankers of London," Markhani is "ardoned" ,by the Crown, and liberated, Buit the record of felony remains, The "pardon"' fiction rests on the assumption that tho w.iole course of anterior Proceedings has been regular; that ever,ybody could not have been wrong; that there is no Power to undo the formal proceedings of judge and jury; saidL that the only appeal Provided by'our law is to the miercy of the Crown." But the process is equally 'sgfainst truthi and justice. Instead of this cruel mockery there should be a solemn procedure to cancel the act of accusal and the conviction-to reverse the sentence, with a public confe-ssion of error. Markham has undergone an .Injury withiout any offenice on his part ; the reversal of the sentence ahould be accompanied by ample comipenisation, assessed in proportion to the damage done.- -6'peetafos-.
TUiE LAST OF, A PA'TELIURCH.-That semi-my-thi-Cal personage, whose memory is so often appealed to, the "(orldest inhabilant" of the north of England, has ceased to -inlaabit this wold. Hexhamn has lost a well-known charac. ter. The church-hell has just tolled for a patriarch known -far and wide as Old John Bell. A link which connected the timnes of Poipe, and Culloden, and G~eorge, I. with the itimes of Tenniyson, and Iimkermann, n ictoria I., has snapped. Old John Bell lias gone the way of all the eartht at the patriarchal age of 110 years or upwards. Although his baptismal register is wanting to prove this, there is littledoubt of the fact. He was the eldest of 10 children;- the gung~est, his brother Jose. h, having been horn in the year
which thle hattle of Hex am riot was focight (9th March, .171), ad Old John Beoll always stated, when questioned as to INii age, that he was poughinrg in Hexhamahire on the day of ttoe riot. Old Johin married early inx life, and an ac-count of the nutnber of his descendants is even mere extra. ordlinary than his age. The old man himself had 10 children, S ofwhloni are now living ; 41. grandchildren ; 60 greatgrandchildren ; and 2 great-great-grandchildren, both of them now living. Old John Bull, although brought up as a farmer, carried his kegs across the Borders, a noted smugggler, and could tail of his exploits and narrow escapes
tohby fl"xi anid fell, He appears throughout to have
ee eced ingly teniperate, as regards bot'h eating and drinkinig, aiid his menital and bodily powers were equally extraordinary, considering his great age. In height he was below the siniddle size, and slender, but lookced what is jenerally terined wiry, Inoffeusive through life, he has
departed from amiong us respected by all who knew hira. In what an extraordIinary epoch he has lived ! What kingdloms have beent swept away, what dynasties have been subverted, how maany millions have departed, since Old -John Bell first saw the light?2 And now, reqssiesccat, he too has departed.-lVoii-thcr-n Dailyi Express.
SPEEiNG THE ELEPHANT.-A friendI tells us of a lich incidemnt that occurred the other day in the court-room zat Frankfort, in which the proverbial attractiors of the
elpant were very forcibly illustrated. It seems that on the day in quostion a menagerie was expected in the city, and
the people were naturally on the quiv r'ime for the aproaching sights-an interest in which, as the sequel shows, his IHonour the Judge keenly participated. Notwithstandin, the Court was held on that day, though not exactly usue.Z In the progress of the morning's business a case of continuance arose, which the Judge was evidently not at all inclined to favour. His countenance, indeed, grew absolutely stern with disfavour. The lawyer in charge having urged his -plea with all the ingenuity and ability at his command, was at length in the act of yielding the point in despair, when a brother lawyer, especially up to anuff, rose, and whispered In his year that the menagerie had arrived, and the elephant would swim the river. The suggestion was big with beliaf. Brightening with hope, the wily lawyer at once drew him-self ypde ferentially, and, addressing ths Conurt, said, "M lay it pleq your Honour, I have this iiioment learned that tbe -great erican menagerie has reached this city, and the elephant will immediately swim the Kentucky river! The people, Iam informed, are alreadythrongingupon the banks wto itness the extraordinary feat." The lilt was al able. The intelligence of Buchanan's election could harAiypha e brought a more wonderful change in the bearing of his . Honour. His stern countenance at once relaxed into the
:nost genial complacenoy, and, in a tolie of generous excite. ment, he reusarked, " Gentlemen, I grant this continuance and adjourn the court I have neter seen an elephant sw;M a river; as I am an old man, it isn't likely that I'll ever have a better opportunity. The consVts adjourned !" The last thing our friend saw of the court, it was making for th 3 river at a speed never contemplated by the Life Insurarce Company. Verily, there's no resisting the elephant.- L;ouissville Journcsl.

The Wreck Of The Tyne.
THE "WRECK OF THE TYNE.
(BY ELEucIc TELEGRAPH.)
SOUTHAMPTON, SUNDAY NIGHT.
The Aid steamtug has come into dock this evening, bringing Captain Vincent and the men who have been engaged in the attempt to get the unfortunate steamship Tyne off the rocks. It had been imagined that the water flowed in at the stern of the ship, from some of the plates having started in that part, and accordingly a strong bulkhead was built across the ship, it being hoped that the leakage was confined to that portion of the vessel. The spring tides being now set in, the floating of the hull was to be attempted. AUl hands were last night set to the pumps, and pumping was kept up all night and to-day, but the water could not be got under before the bulkhead, showing that there were other sources of leakage which had not been discovered. Captain Vincent accordingly considered it useless to continue further operations at present, and brought all the men away, leaving only a few behind at tee scene of the dLsaster; the attempt to move the unfortunate ship these springs is therefore at an end, and we apprehend that her recovery may now be looked upon as hopeless. Further endeavours wll be made at some future period, when a calmer season has set in, but meantime she may be knocked to pieces.

Serious Accident To The Earl Of Harewood.
SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO THE EARL OF
I AREWOOD.
(BY ELEmThIC TELEGRAPH.)
On Saturday morning an accident occurred to the Earl of Elarewood, while hunting, which it if feared may terminate fatally. His Lordship went out with the Braraham-moor hounds, and while hunting in the neighbourhood of Wetherby he was uddenly seen to fall from his horso. One of the whippers in galloped to the spot, and found the noble Eaxl stretched upon the ground unconscious. Assistnce wan immediately rendered, and his Lordship was placed in the carrias
of Mr. J. B. Raviell, of Stockeld.park, and conveyed to his own residence. On arriving there ho was s'ill in a state of insensibility, and a message was at Ce despatched to Leeds for medical aid. Mr. T. P. Tele '
to Earewood-house without delay, and found tlhrt 1 Lordship had sustained a severo frnotorte of tVe :usIL
telegraph message was sent to London +h6 - me ev r,ing, requesting the attendance of Sir Ben;., un Brodie, but a reply was received that de was unable to leavo Lon. don. Tbe assistance of Dr. Caesar Hawkins or Dr. Fergus. soa was then sought, and Dr. Hawkins left London in a spocol t-ain by tie Great Northern Railway, and arrived at Lee ortly after 9 o'clock on Sunday morning. He immediatelWy osted to Harewood-house and, with the assistance of the other medical gentleman, did all for the unfortunate nobleman that skill and science could suggest, The precise cause of the accident cannot be stated, as no person was sufficiently near t., his Lordship at the time to describe it, but it is supposed that the horse which he rode-a young animal-got its feet entangled in a sheep net just after leaping a fence, and in its efforts to extricato itself threw the noble Earl on the ground and kicked him on the head. At the time that our account was despatched it was not known howhis Lordship was pro. gsng.

Sir,-The impossibility of repealing the Bank Charter Act, the inoxpediency of subjecting it to any important modifica tions, the mismanagement of the circulation, and consequent danger to the safety of specie payments out of which the necessity for the act arose, the principles upon which the act was founded, the result which it has secured, the failure of all the shnirter predictions of its opponents, the confirmation it has afforded to the anticipations of its supporters, the stability of public and private credit during the recent severe pressure upon the exchanges, the wonderful developement of industrial energy and of national prosperity which has been in almost uninterrupted progress through the 12 years during which the act has been in force,-all these topics have passed under our review. They constitute a mass of evidence in support of the act of 1844 to which it is needless to attempt to add further strength.
Two points, however, remain to be noticed before the discussion is finally closed. This shall be done as shortly as possible, because these letters have already occupied too large a space in your columns. Those who maintain that the act of 1844 is too restrictive, and wish to return to the system of 1819, chiefly rely on the case of 1847. The true character of that crisis has not been analyzed with sufficient care, and therefore it has not been correctly understood by the public. It was not monetary derangement, or a failure of the act of 1844 to accomplish its legitimate purpose. It was a case of banking mismanagement on the part of the Bank of England acting upon the community, at that moment peculiarly susceptible of alarm under vague and ignorant apprehensions of the effect of the new law. The bulion sustained no dangerous diminution of amount at that time, the notes put forth by the issue department continu ed to vary with the amount of bullion, the notes circulating with the public were not reduced to an unreasonably low amonnt, and, in fact, it was proved by the result that they were sufficient for the business and requirements of the country. Danger fiom undue exhaustion,of the bullion is the evil against which the act undertakes to protect the community ; against an improper exhaustion of the banking reserve, and the consequent inconveniences it is the duty of the Bank of England to take timely and effectual measures of precaution. The act accomplished all its legitimate results on this occasion, and everything went well with the issue department. Not so, however, with the banking department, the regulation of which is not the proper function of the act. The banking reserve of the Bank of England was under a process of continual diminution; the Bank, however, did not raise its rate of interest, but continued its advances as usual, until this reserve was reduced to a dangerous extremity. Sudden and violent measures then became necessary; wild alarm was everywhere excited, and the notes circulating with the public, although the total amount was high, ceased to perform their ordinary functions. All the consequences ensued which may be expected when a concern of colossal magnitude in a critical and trying period is not conducted with corresponding foresight and prudence.
Infirmity of purpose and undue delay in the requisite precautions on the part of the Bank, arising out of previous bad habits and established prejudices, were witnessed in combined operation with nervous timidity on the part of the public, arising out of vague apprehension of a new system of monetary legislation, respecting which the most extravagant alarms had been spread abroad. The result was panic-that is, a paralysis of that mutual confidence between man and man without which the common transactions of society cannot proceed. The amount of the circulation was not insufficient; but the confidence necessary to enable the public to make a proper use of it was in suspense. The sudden collapse necessarily resulting from the great abuse of credit, and the vast amount of imprudent speculation founded upon it, contributed no doubt to the infortunate prostration of confidence; and it may be safely affirmed that, without the timelY intervention which the act of 1844 secured, this abuse of credit and excessive speculation would have continued longer unchecked, and that the ultimate results would have been more extended trading, embarrassment, increased prostration of public confidence, and, finaUy, danger of exhaustion of the bullion. The mercantile disasters of that period were inevitable under any monetary system, on account of the false state of credit which then prevailed. To these might have been added suspension of specie payments-a calamity from which the provisions of the act of 1844, and those only, gave us any effectual security.
The course recently pursued by the Bank of England presents a striking contrast, and the public have reaped all the legitimate fruits of timely pre. caution and enlightened firmness on the part of that body, as well as of reasonable self-possession and confidence on their own part.
Fluctuations in the rate of Interest are by many persons laid to the charge of the act, and the measure, it is contended, has failed because it has neither prevented great fluctuations nor maintained a general low rate of interest.
The framers and supporters of the act never undertook to regulate the rate of interest. They knew that interest is the price paid for the use of capital, and that that price must depend upon the proportion b,tween the supply and the demand for capitaL To regulate that proportion, or in any direct way to influence it is not an appropriate purpose of measures the simple object of which is the proner egulationof the amount of the paper money. But. ii. add.:;on to the inexpediency of any effort to regulato by law the rate of interest and its fluctuati'. s there is the impossibility of success in the at r-pt. By what means is. it possible to prevent ;.e transference of capital or money from country to country? There is a constant tendency towards an equilibrium in the value of money in the different trading towns in the world. If the rate of interest be high in Hamburg and New York and low in London, through how many varied forms wiUmoney be drawn from London to the aid of those places, securities transmitted for sale, bills sent over for discouint, draughts drawn against credits, &-c. Not long since, when the rate of interest rose at Hamburg to 8 per cent., all these means of drawing money from London
were put into action; and the only mode by which the money-market of London could be protected was a rise in the rate of interest here until it approached the level of that of Hamburg. To prevent fluctuations in the rate of interest in England it would be necessary to have the power of regulating them throughout the whole commercial world. The friends of the act of 1844 do not pretend to be in possession of this secret.
All conquest, it has been wisely remarked by a great hiatorian, must be ineffectual, in a light of precaution, unless it be universal. Some neighbouring country must lie upon the frontier, and dis. turb by its promity. So it is with the rate of interest under the modern facilities for international
intercourse andthe transference of capital. Whatever be the cause which disturbs confidence or powerfully affects the rate of interest in other countries, the vibration must be felt with us. We cannot enjoy ease, abundance of money, ana low rate of interest, while our neighbours are straitened by difficulties and embarrassed by pecuniary pres-
Thdu.
But upon wrhat reasons does the assumption rest
tlat fluctuations in the rate of interest afford presumptive evidence of anything unsatisfactory in the condition of the country in which they occur ? Are they not rather the necessary accompaniments of rapid creation of wealth? A steady and unvarying rate of iuterest is generaUy the result of a torpid state of capital and of industry, while in countries rapidly advancing in prosperity by means of industrial energy, speculative activity, and commercial enterprise, there wiU always be fluctuations in the rate of interest. Are there any cities more progressive in material wealth and in commercial prosperity than HIamburg or New York ? And in those cities the rate of interest is subject to frequent and violent fluctuations. Take, on the other hand the case of Holland, a country of great acccumulated capital, and which is adding to that accumulation by large annual savings, but in which the spirit of enterprise which generates great national progress is comparatively quiescent. Here we find the rate of interest lower and the fluctuations more restricted. Inconsistency in their expectations is a common source of delusion with communities as well as individuals; and a stronger case of such inconsistency cannot wel be conceived than that of wishing to combine the ease supposed to attend a 'ow and unvarying rate of interest with continuous progress in all the elements of national prosperity. In our physical condition, in our intelectual character, and in all that concerns our materi6l prosperity, the law is the same-no great result will ever spring from quiescent indulgence. Bodily health, mental vigour, national progress in prosperity and wealth, can be secured only by con stant stir, unremitting struggle, competition, and rivalship, and in the never-ceasing variation of circumstances and condition which these necessarily generate. We may therefore cast aside aU weak apprehensions caused by fluctuations in the rate of interest; they are indicative of energy in our coImimercial spirit and of progress in our national prosperity. A high rate of interest when it occurs does not necessarily arrest tradmng activity, and convert real prosperity into embarrassment and ruin. Upon this point we may appeal to the present condition of the country and to the course of events during the past year. It is false prosperity, excessive credit, and ouer trading which alone are seriously embarrassed by monetary pressure and a high rate of interest. Those who trade with their own capital, or who rely to a moderate extent only upon the support of credit, experience little inconvenience under such circumstances, while the bold speculators who depend for the means of supporting their enterprises to an undue extent upon borrowed capital are incon venienced by the increased difficulty of obtaining it and the high price they must pay for it. In producing this result does not that pressure really render good service to the community, by checking the too rapid expansion of speculative transactions, thus destroying the seeds of future evil, and arresting the progress of spreading mischief ? NVe have had monetary pressure and a high rate of interest in 1847 and 1856. Inthe firstcaseit was accompanied by extensive mercantile embarrassment. In the latter we have had nothing of the kind.
What is the cause of this difference ?
In 1847 the monetary pressure fell upon a state of mercantile affairs prosperous in appearance, but reallyunsound. Trading upon borrowed capital and credit had been carried to an undue extent. The pressure detected that unsoundness, and arrested the further spread of it.
In 1856 it has faUen upon a comparatively sound state of trade; it is therefore unaccompanied by any general embarrassment, and we hear little or no serious complaint respecting it. The outcry against the act of 1844 as causing a degree of pressure which trade cannot bear is altogether fallacious; the pressure is, in fact, unavoidable under any monetary laws which are not inconsistent with the maintenance of specie payments. A sound state of trade not only bears the pressure, but takes no serious account of it.
An unsound state of trade feels the pressure in proportion to its unsoundness, and the very sense of the pressure proves the necessity and the usefulness of it.
I cannot venture to trespass further upon your columns, although the subject is not exhausted, nor have the considerations alluded to undergone a full examination.
In proposing to Parliament the measure of 1819 Sir Robert Peel adverted to the restoration of the money of the country to its just value as one of the distinguishing features of the reign of Elizabeth. A similar service rendered to the country by the acts of 1819 and 1844 consecrates his own memory. Is there the Minister who will now venture to reverse the principles on which these measures rest, to roll back the tide of knowledge on these questions, and to plunge the country again in the confusion and difficulty which are inseparable from a system of paper money subjected to no fixed limitation of amount, and therefore of undefined and ever-varying value? The country is exposed to no such danger. The Govermment is too wise to submit such a proposition, and Parliament and the public, confirmed in their original determination by recent experience, would at once refuse to entertain it. The one single purpose of the act of 1844 is to preserve a constant equality of value between gold and paper notes, and to render the notes at all times convertible into gold. Any objection, therefore, to our present system on the ground of its supposed stringency or unnecessary pressure upon trade or industry is, in reality, an objection to a gold circulation, or, in other words, to specie payments.
Is it the fact, then, that a metallic currency is necessarily inconsistent with national prosperity or progress ? These depend upon the amount of capital, the distribution of it, and the rate of profit. In what way can a metallic currency exercise any injurious influence on these, the true sources of national wealth ? The currency forms the medium through which the command of transferable capital is passed from one person to another; but it is important not to confound the instrument of transfer with the thing to be transferred. The real difficulty during a period of monetary pressure is the deficiency of transferable capital to bupply the requirements of those who
bave been carrying on transactions of greater mng-
nitude and extent than they can support by their own legitimate means. A greater supply of this transferable capital for the support of concerns which have relied too much upon credit is the real want. More currency is the demand of shortsighted clamour. Not more absurd would it be in a period of dearth to clamour for more mills to grind and more carts to distribute the corn which does not exist; or in a period of drought to seek relief by multiplying the pumps when the springs are dry.
Let those who raise an outcry against the insufficiency of the amount of the circulation under the provisions of the acts of 1819 and 1844 directly meet this question. Until they do this they must not hope to command the attention of an intelligent community.

(FROM OUR OWN cOhlESPo"Fl VA
(A porHon of the following appeared in our scondi ediUon of Saturday:-]
PARIS, FnRiDAY, JAN. 23, 6 P.M.
The Monitewr of yesterday publishes tho following article:-
"The NeuchAtel prisoners have been liberated, and axe already on the French territory. The Helvetic Governnment, in concert with the national representation of the country, has performed an act which does it honour, and which is in perfect keeping with the true interests of S witzerland.
"' The Government of the Emperor had advised that measure already in September last, and had renewed its advice In a communication dated 26th November. Aware-in confidence-of the conciliatory intentions of King Frederick Wiliam, and knowing that the whole question lay in the inconditional liberation of the prisoners, it found it necessay to insist on maaling the Federal Government understand the full bearing of the request that was made to it.
" If Switzerland refused, France could no longer deter the King of Prussia, whose spirit of moderation she highly appreciated, from having recourse to arms to procure a just satisfaction for his offended dignity. If, on the contrary, Switzerland complied with the counsels of Franco, the latter fouLnd herself engaged to make use of that concession with the Cabinet of Berlin to prevent any coercive measures, and to claim a satisfactory solution of the Neuchatel question.
"W We therefore congratulate ourselves upon the resolution taken by the Helvetic Confederation, She may at once fearle3sly dismiss her contingents, and the Prussian Government having already announced that it is ready to commence megotiations on the ground itself of the dispute, a final arrangement may be hoped for conformable to the intere4ts as well as to the dignity of both parties."
The foregoing is certainly an improvement, so far as language is concerned, on the former article in the official journal, which had the Ml-luck to displease both parties-Switzerland, from the rather haughty tone which pervaded it; and Prussia, from the patronizing air it affected. In the present communication there is no allusion to the sacred and inviolable character of the treaties of 1815, so out of place when emanating from a Bonaparte dynasty, or to the obstinacy and ingratitude of the Swiss. Nevertheless, I doubt whether it will give great Eatisfaction to the Swiss.
The French papers have been recommended not to publish any more details respecting the assassin Verger until the Court of Cassation shall have decided on his appeal. The Court met for that purpose yesterday, but, his counsel having claimed a delay of 10 days from the date of his appeal, the Court adjourned until Thursday next.
The Aflrniteur de la Flotte contains news from China not hitherto published. It was known at Macao that the Russian Government had obtained permission at Pekin for their ships to enter the five ports. This fact is consildered to be extremely important. Russia has had for some years extensive commercial relations with China by land, and, according to the terms of a treaty signed in 1725, the town of Kiachta, situate on the frontiers of the two empires, serves as a commercial entrepot. Commerce has increased, and is considerably extending itself on that point. The Russian Go vernment, in order to establish its relations more firmly with China, has obtained the privilege of having a Legation at Pekina favour which no other Power enjoys, but, on the other hand, the Chinese Government had always refused to receive Russian ships in the five ports into which the ships of other nations were admitted. Trade between Russia and China has been hitherto carried on solely by land. Admiral Panlutin, who commanded the Russian squadron in the China Seas at the breaking out of the last war, used his utmost efforts to obtain a treaty which would place his Government on the same footing as the most favoured nations. He would probablv have succeeded had not the war paralyzed his operatlons. It is impossible to give an idea of the anarchy which prevails at this moment in various provinces of China. Highway robbery is organized on a most extensive scale. The Government has neither force nor authority to suppress the highwaymen. The Mandarins execute a multitude of inoffensive beggars, but they are helpless against thieves. Yeh, the Viceroy of Canton, is one of the most abominable and cruel men in the empire. Re maintained a number of mendicants of the most unfortunate description, and every time any act of violence was committed in the city, being too feeble or too great a coward to dare to arrest the assassins, he selected a dozen mendicants, whom he ordered to be decapitated, and he then wrote to the Emperor that a horrible crime had been committed, but that the autho, s had been arrested and punished. It is by these repeated falsehoods that the Mandarins deceive the Emperor, who is never perThitted to know the truth, The insurgents, with their chief, Tao-ping, are completely masters of the province of RiangSu. Their head-quarters are at Nanldin. That city may be regarded as for ever lost to the Emperor, for his authority can never be re-established there. It was impossible to show more incapacity than did the Imperial generals. The insurgents have fortified the Yang-Tse-Kang, and the mouth of that river is closed against the Chinese fleet. By the latest accounts Admiral Seymour was still at Canton. He had established himself so as not to be annoyed by the Tartar troops. He had been joined by the hospital-ship Minden, and had sent the Winchester and Coromandel to Hongkong, the Sybille to WN%hampoa, and the Pique and Hornet to Shanghai. He had done so at the request of the British Consuls, who had demanded them for the protection of British subjects.
A letter from Jassy (Moldavia), of the 7th insl., informs us that, in consequence of despatches received from Paris, Colonel Besson, the French Commaissioner for defining the boundaries, set out immediately for Bessarabia. It is believed that the boundary line of the new frontier will be completely settled in 25 or 30 days. Consequently the evacuation of the provinces by the Austrian troops maybe commenced at the beginning of February, so as to be concluded by the lst of March, the period at which a thaw generally commences in those countries. The present season is as favourable as possible for the movement of troops, the roads beLng in excellent order. The winter has been most genial, and the very elements appear to favour a speedy termination of the affair. The news of a good understanding between Great Britain and France is regarded in Moldavia as a blessing from Heaven.

(FROM ou OWN CoxrnsPooNDEr.)
CONSTANTINOPLE, As. 31
The Commissoners for the Principalities have t;t last been delivered from the inactivity in -which they hxyew been lingering since their arrival here. When they fist came it was under the impresion that they would obly have to remain for a few weeks, aud they have been here now for the last ive nmonths In the moat embrnai position, and withouthAving anything to do. Last week telegraphic despatches were recelved announcing that the Powers had come to au understanding about the withdrawal of the Rusians from the ceded teritories, and about the final evacuation of the Turlish moil. Immediately after the signature of the protocol orders are to be sent to the Bessarabian Boundary Vommiwloners to proeed to the ipiita whioll Wia
been hitherto a matter of dispute, and to trace the future frontier line according to the agreement coatained in the protocol. As soon as this is done the Austrians are to begin to evacuate the principalities, and by the 30th of March, the anniversary of the treaty of Paris, all parties must have left. It is stated that the Russians proposed a term of six weeks from the signature of the protocol for the fulfilment of the conditions contained in it, but that this period was increased on therepresentations of the Austrian plenipotentiary. The Russians will at once withdraw the seven men from the Serpents' Island, and at the time I am writing this is very likely done.
The Austrians have actually begun to move, so a telegraphic despatch, arrived the day before yesterday from Bucharest, announces' The- have stopped all their contracts, and in several cases paid a forfeit for doing so. The weather, as if to favour these good intentions, has changed al on the Danube line since the beginning of the year. The roads, which had been until then all but impassable, are now hardened by frost and covered with snow, so that no difficulties will be encountered in the retreat.
Thus, if no other obstacle intervenes, the Commission wil be able to begin its work by the end of April, four weeks being quite sufficient time for the elections of the Divans and all other preliminary arrangements which may be required. Very little remains to be done in this respect, for, as you know, the firman is drawn up according to the modifications adopted in the conferences, and to-morrow the mixced coference, at which the Comnimissioners are to take part, will be held at the Grand Vizier's country house on the Bosphorus. It is not likely that more than one of these conferences will take place, for, the terms being once fixed, any remarks or objections brought forward by some member of the commission wil scarcely alter them.
Great activity reigns in the War Department. As soon as the happy solution of the pending diplomatic disputes and the time for the evacuation of the Danubian Principalities by the Austrians became officially known, the formation of the Turkish corps dl'ariwe which is to take their place and occupy the principalities up to the time of their final organization was begiun.
ThQre are to be seven battalions in Jassy and eight at Bucharest, and the corps d'armke of Roumelia is to supply them. Nearly all the troops belonging to this clivision of the army, besides several battalions belonging to others, have been hitherto employed to put down the disturbauces in Albania and the brigandage on the frontiers of Greece. They have been successful in both places. Every mail from Volo brings news of the capture and execution of noted brigands who had infested the country for years; moreover, the organization of the irregulars in those parts has progressed so far that most of the regular troops can be dispensed with.
Besides the cwrps dl'arnmie for the principalities, another is about to be concentrated at Erzeroum and on the Persian frontier. The possibility of a war between England and Persia excites the greatest apprehensions wvith the Government here. In alliance with the former, and with the best understanding with the latter, it is placed in a most amwkward position, especially if the war shouild asssume larger proportions, and Russia should become mixed up with it. Turkey has a frontier line of more than 600 miles contiguous to Persia. She must be prepared for all emergencies, and this is the reason for the concentration of a coips d' armee at Erzeroumn. In the meantime a declaration has been made by the Government to the effect that Turkey will keep the strictest neutrality in the war, should it take place. Ismail Pasha, of Danube celebrity, is to command the co)ps di' arm6e. The commander for the corps d' orn7e in the principalities is not yet named. Omar Pasha, as commander of the army of Roumelia, claims the post, and certainly as long as he remains so it is difficult to see how the command over the greatest part of his cors d' armne can be given to anybody else.
The Bank project has been so far accepted by Messrs. Wilkins's principals, but questions are asked about the details, which are very incomplete. No answer has been as yet returned to them by the Government.
The English submarine telegraph line from this to Varna will be taken by the Turkish Government. Negotiations have been opened to settle the amount to be paid and the manner of working it. Colonel Biddulph, R.A., and Lieutenant Holdsworth, R.A., who are at present in charge of the line, will superintend it, at least in the beginning.-

VIENNA, JAir. 21.
As General Sir Hugh Rose has now left Vienna, there can be no reason why the public should not be informaed how he has been employed here during the last few months. During the recent war it became evident that the organization of more than one of the armies which took a part in it was faulty, and as soon as peace was concluded the various Governments began to prepare to make those changes in their military system which were necessary. Since the conclusion of the wars in Italy and Hungary the attention of the Emperor Francis Joseph and his gener.als has been directed to the improvement of the army and military establishments, and General Rose has had a most favourable opportunity of examining into the Austrian military system, which is generally considered to be extremely good. It is not positively known whether Sir Hugh was collecting information in pursuance of instrutions received from the Waroffice, but it is to be supposed that such was the case, as an Austrian staff officer was always at his disposal. It is related that General Rose has sent home a detailed account of what he saw here, and if so he has certainly rendered good service to his country. The Austrian baggage and pontoon trains, ambulances, &c., are as perfect as such things can be, andtheso-called "sanitarycompanies" aretheadmiration of all foreign officers. It has often been observed that troops are very apt to get into disorder if there are many wounded men to be carried to the rear during an engagement, and in order that no man shall in future be obliged to quit the ranks while the action is going on the above-mentioned companies have been formed. Each of the men is taught the first rudiments of surgery, and most of them can apply the tourniquet or dress a wound as well, if not better than the common " barber-surgeons." General Rose had several opportunities of seeing the Austrians throw bridges across the Danube in a marvellously short space of time, and it is to be hoped that he has made himself master of their system. The employment of gun-cotton for artillery is also an Austrian " secialitW," but the artillery officers never speak of the results of the experiments which they have been making for the last four years. In return for the attention paid by the naval and military authorities to General Baron Smola,* who not long since visited the Government establishments in England, every facility was afforded by the Austrians to General Rose.
In consequence of the absence of the Emperor and his MNfinisters, there is little or nothing doing in politics. To the address of the Podesta of Milan the Emperor replied, " The past is forgotten." To the great delight of the inhabitants of Vicenza the
fortuncations are to be dismantled. The Credit Bank is about to establish branch banks in the different provincial capitals. It is related that the Russian Government has granted a concession to a private company to construct a railroad from Odessa, by way of Kiefi; to Brody, in Austrian Galicia. The harvest in Southern Russia was but middling. In Podolia, Volhynia, and in the government of Kieff the seed sown in the winter failed. In Bessarabia, Ek-aterinoslaff, and Eherson the seed sown in summer throve. The quantity of corn lying at Odessa, Berdiansk, and Taganrog is but small. In the northern provinces of Russia the harvest was good.
* Baron Smola, who died a few months since, was chief of a section in the artillery department.

DUBLIT, SATURDAY MOsb1tG. ENCUIMBERED ESTATES' COURT.
The Weekly Telegraph has the following sensible remarks in reference to the working of the Encumbered Estates' Court. Since the whole of the onerous duties of its administration have been place-l upon the shoulders of two commissioners, one of them, from sheer over-labour, has been compelled to seek temporary retirement in order to recruit his exhausted strength. In fact, busiess of late ha3 come to a deadlock, and the Telegraph's estimate of the number of dormant oases in Baron Richards's office, falls very short indeed of the actual araount remaining for final adjudication:-
" As was anticipated by everyone acquainted with tho internal working of the Lncumbered Estates' Court, the retirement of one of the commissioners has so clogged the wheel of the Court's action that its functions cannot be exercised in that order which characterized its onerations prtviously. For this we have, as usual, to think the Solo' s of the Govern-ent, who, when they cannot safely interfere with their own Courts, exercise their proverbial ingenuity in dead-locking ours. The business of the Coatt Is therefore, considerably retarded, precisely as under such circumstances might have been expected. There are, we are informed, from 50 to 60 cases in the retired Comnmissioner's office lying in a dormant condition, a status quo in which they are likely to remain if we may judge from ap. pearances. The remaining commissloners are, as it is, overwhelmed with the amount of duties they have to perforn, and it is evident that the interference of Government is indispensable. To add to the difficulty, Mr. Hargreave, one of the remaining commissioners, as zealous and painstaking a gentleman as could well be found, has been compelled to retire for a few days from Renrietta-street in order to recruit his health, which has been temporarily impaired by the arduous nature of his official labours. Only one of the commissioners, Dr. Lon-field, therefore remains-a gentleman whose zeal inthedisohare of his onerous duties is too well known to need any aditional testimony from us. Unlesa, therefore, something he at once done to supply the vacancy in the Court, the inconvenience to those who have important interests at stake wll increase to such an extent that they must become irremediable. The benefits which the Encumbered Estates' Court has conferred, and is calculated still further to confer on Ireland, cannot well be overrated. Nothing should, therefore, he neglected, either by the present or any fature Administration, to carry out the great objects for which it was instituted, abnd to afford it every aid and facility in giving itastaffofofficers sufficient in number to compass all its requirements."
THE BANK OF IMELA1ID AND TE SADLiS.
Notwithstanding the habitual caution of the Bank of Ireland, it appears that it too has been a sufferer in a minor degree by its dealings with the refugee member for Tipperary. In the Court of Queen's Bench yesterday counsel renewed an application, made on the part of the Bank of Ireland on a previous day, for liberty, under the 34th section of the Common Law Procedure Act, to slubstitute service of the summons and plaint on the defendant, Sir Matthew R. Sausse, at present a judge in Bombay, by serving the process on his sister, who resided in Hume-street, and with whom it was sworn he was in constant communication. The action was brought on foot of promissory notes for 7001., of which Sir Matthew Sausse was the maker and James Sadleir the payee, and they were dated only a few days before the defendant left this country for India, where he had been promoted to a seat onthejudicialbench Counselnowsubmitted that it would be an extraordinary circumstance if a judge in our colonies circulating such notesjust before his departure, and the bank giving credit for them, could not be reached through the intervention of the clause in the recent act of Parliament. The statute not only provided for service upon the land or law agent of the party, or in the event of his leaving the country, but where the Court were satisfied that there were other good grounds for substituting service. The Chief Justice observed, that at common law they had no power to Issue process out of the jurisdiction, but then came the act of Parliament giving them authority to substitute service in certain cases. They were bound, however, to avoid exceeding the powers conferred upon them by the Legislature, and where was there any power given to substitute service upon a person who might be In communication with another, not upon business affairs, but merely as a personal or private friend ? It was not alleged that Sir Matthew Sausse had any land or law agent in this country; it was not shown that there was any person acting for him in this country whose duty it would be to defend any action brought against him; and it would be going very far indeed to hold thatany one should be bound by reason of an acquaintance or relative writing to him. Judge Perrin fully concurred in the rule pronouncedbythe ChiefJustice, and saidmostdangerous consequences would result from acceding to the principle sought to be enforced in the present instance. Every officer in the army serving his country abroad might as well be bound by proceedlngs taken in his absence, if he communicated with relatives or friends in this country, who could not, even if they did interfere, supply the information necessary for his defence.
THE POPE AND E IRISH BISHOPS.
According to the orthodox authority of the Nation, the good clergy of the diocess of Ferns have been thrown into a state of the utmost surprise and alarm by well founded reports lately received from Rome. It is said that serious attempts are being made, not openly, but under the mask of a subtle diplomacy, to prevent Dr. Furlong's elevation to the episcopacy, and thus to frustrate the almost unanimous wish of the entire diocess. The Nation is not surprised to hear that feelings of anxious suspense and intense displeasure are experienced at this moment by the clergy and peop'e of Wexford.
MODEL FARMING.
A return which has just been laid before the public, showing the last year's expenditure of the funds at the disposal of the National Board of Education for the Encouragement of Model Farming and the Science of Agriculture generally, is not as satisfactory as could be desired; and, as the figures cannot be controverted, people will naturally think that, unless the experiment can be worked out on a more economical scale, the sooner it is abandoned the better. An Irish journal, not apt to cavil at any project sanctioned by the Education Board, o0serves,-
" It appears by the returns of the past year's labours in rural enterprise that the Glasnevin model farm, consisting of about 180 acres, was cultivated at an expense of 5,1501., and that the proceeds of sale of crops only amounted to l,4451., thustnvolvinga directloss of 3,7OD. in this one instance. If the object of the Glnevn farm be that of teaching the art of agrculture to young men who take out [their degrees from that cemetery for cash, we would ques-
tion very seriosly whether student, taucht the newest modes of squandering money without due regard to after results, were likely to become good paying tenants; that is, provided they acted on their own farms up to the principles carried out at Glasnevin. Lord Lucan, when in the vein of discontent, grambles most eloquently about the race of tenant-farmers, who, in these degenerate days of whole coats and glass windows, do not come up to the noble earr lIdea of eucdal dependence. Wewil venture to afflrm thattvwo years' experience of model farming on the Glasnevin'systemI would give the galant Western more material for wrathfnl epistles than al the taunting about the charge at B1al
kiava. Leaving the chief farm on the 'model' princi le, we finad Kilkenny far up in the list of expenditure. Last
I outlay vas 4831. and the income 121., showing the andsome balance of 4711. In favour of agricultural quackery. The Ulster ' model is quite equal to the rest of its economic brethren. Last season's expenses were 7501., and the proceeds of sale of crop and other soarces of income amounted to the round sum total of 401., thus involving a loss of 7101. on the yeas experiments,"
It appears that the total outlay on the 19 "models" wasl12,348,, and thereturns 3,7241., giving a direct loss of public money amounting to the round suim of 8,6241. The journal continues .

" W etrs thlat ten Cormmlssoners of National Education, the directors of that code of instruction which h's

The entire principle c-f model farming, as already noted, is not only bad, but posi. tively pernicious, and the sooner it is set aside the better wil it be foraU interests. The young farmer does not require a perambulator any more than the juvenile factory operative. At one period it was thought that the tiller of the soil could not exist without the pap of protection.

This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancollor Stuart. The object of the suit was to have the real and personal estate of the late Catherine Cumming, who was found to have been of unsound mind from the 1st of May, 1846, administered in this court, and to have the same applied in payment of her debts. It appeared that Mrs. Camming was seized of certain copyhold estates, and in the year 1847 did an act in respect to them, and which was entered upon the court rolls, which had the effect of making them assets for the payment of debts. One of the questions raised on the hearing of the cause was whether this trans. action was void from having been entered into by Mrs. Cumming after the time she had been declared to be of unsound mind, and the Vice-Chancellor held that it was not. Another point was whether Urs. Cumming was seized of certain of the real estates absolutely in foe or had only an estate tail in them. The decision of the Court below was practically in favour of the creditors, and Mrs. Inee, one of the co-heiresses at law of Mrs. Cunming, now appealed from it. The case occupied the entire day without bemg concluded.
Mr. Baoon and Mlr. W. Morris appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Walker, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Burdon, and Mr. Hemming for the defendants.

IN PE THE ROYAT. T'TQTrTT R A -
(Before Vwc- Cha,eor Sir R4 T. K.0-MtRSEY.I
Mr. GLASSE (with whom was Mr. W. D. Lewis), on behalf of the official manager, said that the case of Mr. Kirkman and 73 other shareholders related to a charge of alleged fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the directors, or some of them, on the occasion of the purchase of shares. The question had been raised at law as between the shareholders and creditors, but here it was as between the shareholders inte- se.
The VICE-CH.NCELLOR said that the chief clerk's view was that, although there might be misrepresentation, stilt that did not prevent liability as contributories. If the evi
deoce -was gone into on such fraud there might be a considerable time taken up and expense incurred, and that ap. peared to his Honour to be the most reasonable course to adopt, more particularly in the absence of Mr. Selwyn, who appeared for the 73 shareholders.
AMr. GLASSE said that he mentioned the matter with the assent of Mr. Selwyn's clients.
The VicE-nHcELLoR said that, from what took place in chambers, it appeared to him that it was contended on the part of the shareholders that he ought not to determine the abstract question at present, but the official manager contended that he ought to do so.
IN RE WALTON AND HUX.
Mr. GLASSE and Mr. W. D. LEwIs then proceeded with the case of these contributories, taking Walton's case first which was, in fact, precisely the same as to the question raised in the case of Hue. Under the 53d sec. of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 113, and the 10th, Ulth and 17th sections of the charter of the Royal British Bank, every transfer of shares must be regalated by the act and charter reciting the deed of settlement. By the 10th soction of the charter it was declared that it should be lawful for every proprietor of shares or those claiming in his right, with the consent of the board of directors, to transfer shares to any person, sabject to the conditions and restrictions therein contained, and that the shares should be transferred, and the secretary should enter a memorial in the books, and endorse such entry on the deed of transfer, and that such deed was sufficient evidence. By the 1lth section persons making transfers and those to
hom transfers were made should give seven days' notice in writing to the directors, specifying the name, trades, or professions of the parties, and the price paid ; and by the 17th section whenever any shares should be forfeited or duly transferred, the former proprietor should be released from al responsibility in this respect, and from aU future obs ervance of the conditions in the deed contained, and persons should take shares subject to the obligations of the persons transferring the same. Under these clauses the question was whether a certain transfer was or was not effectuaUy made within the provisions of the deed; the contention of the present applicants being that the transferor was primarily liable, less than three years having elapsed since the transfer. Charles Walton was the holder of 20 shares, and died on the 26th of April, 1856, and on the 21st of August his executors sold his shares, the bank stopping on the 3d of September, and when, therefore, danger was rife. The transfer was made to James Wemfry and James Meston, and, the transfer being signed by the executors before the bank stopped, no consent of the directors was ever obtained to such transfer, and therefore, on the common well-known principle, the present contributories could not be held liable, the transfer having been infornal.-Charter's case (1 De Gex. and Sm., 587).
Mr. GIFFARD, for the executors, contended that from the time the bank commenced business in 1849 until it stopped there was no entry in any one book of such a transfer, 1,500 shares having been transfe*Ted, the entry being made on the transfer itself, and the transfer clerk had so consented that the directors could not afterwards object, he being their authorized officer, whether it was or not according to the form of the deed.
The VICE-CII. NCELLOR said that every shareholdor had a right to say, " You shall not bind me unlsss you pursue the terms of the deed."
Mr. GIFFARD.-If the matter was once got within the power of the directors formality was nothing.
Mr. GLASsE said that there were entries of transfers in the books.
Mr. GIFFr.RD said that there was no resolution of
proval before the transfer.-" Sanderson's case" (3, Dc Gex and Sm., 66).
The case is still proceeding.

PEESRENS V. JOIINSON.-JOIINSON V. PERRENS.
These causes, which are an original and a cross suit, occupied the Court a portion of Friday and the whole of Saturday, and are still unconcluded. The parties in the suits have been co-partners in certain coal mines in Warwickshire, and the dispute between them now is in effect as to the mode in which the ehare of a putner who had been excluded bh his co-partners in pursuance of a provision to that effect in the deed of partnership, by his share being taken in execution, was to be valned, such share having been purchased by the continuing partners at the sheriff's sale.
Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernard were for the plaintiffs in the first suit, who were the defendants in the second suit; and Mr. Malins and Mhr. Renshaw for the defendant in the first suit, who was the plaintiff in the second suit.

In this case a petition had been presented for winding up the affairs of the company, at the instance of the company itself.

Mr. Rolt, Mr. Daniel, Mr. Speed, and Mr. W. Cooper were for the company and for parties connected with the snit.
I3ORRODATILE V. SM1ART.
This was a claim ariSing out of an agreement for a lease. The single point raised for disoussion was whether either contracting party had a right, in the absence of any positive stipulation to that effect, to see by himself, or his agent, the other contraoting party execute the lease or deed.
Mr. ROGRES, for one of the contracting parties, contended for this right, and insisted that it was the practice, and that it was also founded on strict right. Inquiry had been made at numerous offices, and the fact was beyond all question that it was the practice to require the parties to the deed to attend personally at the lessor's offieo, in the case of a lease, and sign the deed in the presence of the other or his agent. It was invariably done in the case of all great landowner s,ech as Lord Southampton, the Duke of Bedford, and others. In the present case there had been an offer to refer the question to tb.e council of the Law Institution, but this offer had been declined; the party was compelled to ask the decsion of his H onour.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR having ascertained that thelease had been executed in October, and that an affidavit of its execution had been filed a day or two ago, said he considered that there was no strict right in a contracting party to require the execution in the presence of the other part
or his agent. Of course, a stipulation to that effect migy6 be easily introduced if it was thought desirable, but, in the absence of any such stipulation, the right could not be enforced, whatever might be the practice. He must decree the delivery up of the lease which had been executed, and the party who was right in his contention must have his costs.

Tis was a special case for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether the executors of a deceased incumnbent were entitled to remore a hothouse which the deceased incumbent had erected in the garden of the rectory, or whether it passed with the incumbency to the successor.
The COURT having taken time to consider,
Lord CAmaPuEL now delivered the judgment of the Court in favour of the plaintiffs.
WOBXSOP BOARD OF HEALTEr (RESPONDENTS) AND MORRIS
AMiD ANOTE}R (APPELLANIS).
This was a case stated for the opinion of the Court, and which raised the question whether a rate made by the Worksop Board of Health, otder the Publio HealthMAYat (the Ilth and 12th of Victoria, cap. 63), was a good rate. The rate was objected to on three grounds because it was mado, first, for defraying the expense of a suit In Chanoerv; secondly, for defraying the costs incnrred by proceedings on a quo 70arranto in this court; and thirdly, fo ying the expense of opposing a bill in Parliamert. 'nth
Mr. TINDAL A nIXSOi, in snpport oE the rate, said pro. ceedings In Chancery had been instituted against the board to restrain them by injunction from making a sewer;* and the boord had beenw compelledt toi6°to Chancery, to defend
their right to maLke the sewer. The case, therefore, came within the 140th section, which enacted that nothing done by the board should, "if the matter or thing were done or the contract were entered into bon4 fide for the purpose of executing the act,' subject them to a habibty and I hat "any expense incurred by such locar board, member, &c., as aforesaid, shall be borne and repaid out of the general district rates levied under the authority of this act." The Chancery proceedings were taken by the board in a matter of public interest, and in which they had no private interest. With respect to the second point, the expense was incurred by defending the right of a member attacked by quo thant t aso.
Mr. Justice CoLETne Couch au expense might be allowed where the whole body was attackpte
Lord CAMPBELL.-BQt if a gentleman aspires to the tonour of sitting on such a board he must pay the expense of defending his right.
Mr. ATKINSON said the third objection related to the expense incured by OPPosing a bill in Pariament-a gas bilL.

Mr. justico CoLuerDGE said it would have been easy to obtain the consent of the ratepayerg.
Mr. WELdBY, for tho appellantd, contended that the rate was bad.

Mr. Wsm y sad it was enough for him to show that the rate was had im any one part. But he believed the paurte Wished to have theodecinsion of the Court on all the point for their future gd an. The learned counsel spggested that a rate coud not be made for defraying the expenses of the Chancery suit unti it cawe to an end.
Lord Cs,SiPBELL.-In a Chancery suit?e (Laughter.) ihis Lordship then said be had no difficulty in sying the rate was bad ifcitwasmade forone heal pupose. Th expense incurred on the quo wtr-ranto did not come vithin either the 140thx or 87th section. His Lordship thought it was lawful to apply the fund to defrying the expense of the Chancery suit, and that that expense had beea boin4jid and necessarilyv incurred. But as to the expense of opposing the gas bil in Parliament as the facts stood the expense was not justifiable, for no advantage appeared to have been gained, or was likely to be gained. Tsu e act of Parliat
ment was a most beneficial one, but it was liable to great abuse. Therowas no act under which there was greater op portunity for jobbing, and whie it was the duty of this Court to assist those hoards in carrying out the act for the pubali benefit it as their duty to guard the ratepayers from a nisapplication of the funds. If the expense of opposing bll in Parliament were to be paid by the rate. payers, it would lead to great abuse. Stil a case might arise where that aight be allowed, particularly if the ratepayers were consulted andc gave thei consent.
The other judges being of the same opinion, Judgment was given for the appellants

MT. EDWIN JAMEs, Q.C., moved for a rule to show cause why an order made by Mr. Justice Crompton should not be resinded and why the above cause should not be tried at the next sittins. The laintiff ad purchased of the defendant a publication called the Britih s ergmy DcI.patD, and the actioeu was brought to recover back the purchase-money, 1e,1ee, on the ground of sinspresentation of its value.
fore the cause camne on for trial it was coye proinee on the defendant agreeing to pay 5001. by instalments and on certain other terms; these terms, the learned counsel now stated,.the defendant had violated. The first instalment had om due, bus t was not paid; ; and when the offceA r went to arrest Colonel Sleigh he produced a protection from the Insolvent Court, which would expire on the 24th of February, by which time the defendant expected to be mnemnber for Greenwich. This was a gross breach of faith, and miglitliave the effect of defeating the plaintiff's remedr.

THE COUNCLI, OF TTHE BOROUGH OF BRIGHTON.
This case cae before the Court upon a demurrer to a return to a mandamous.
The mandamus alleged that the prosecutor, W. V. Langridge, was clerk of the peace for the county of Sussex, and as such entitled to certain fees from that part of the county in which Brighton was situated. It then alleged that Her ofaesty had granted a separate Court of Quarter Sessions to be held at Brihton, and that a clerk of the pane for that borough had beappoiny offioe o fat ridge) had been thereby passg ofo act op he Lsang-
aboHsed, r wh sha be emovd frm hi S fees andeth deprived of his office q.oa" Brighton, and was entitled to compensation; tbat he had claimued, compensation, from the council, who had allowed his claim in part, and awarded iam the sum of 71. 12s. a-year; that he then appealed to the Lords of the Treasury, who had awarded him an annuity of1421.a-yoar. The maudaus thendirected the counil to affix their scal to a bond to sesuLre such amiount. The return set forth that the prosecutor's office had not been abolished, nor had he been removed therefrom, except so faer as relate
to the loss of fees for business done in Brighten. This return was demurred to, and thus the question was raised whether the prosecutor was entitled to compensation under the 66th secton of the hunicipal Corporations Act (5 ande6 William IV., cap. 76), which enacted that "every officer of any borough or county who shall be in any office of profit at the time of the passing of this act, whose office shall be abolished, or who shall he removed from his office under the provisions of this act, &c.,u should be entitled to compensation, to be awarded by the council, with a right of appeal to the Lords of the Treasuyt.
Mr.ent Cwr AMBERS, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Lush), in sapport of the demurrer, contended that there was an abolition of the office quoad Brighton, and that Mr. Langridge was entitled to compply.
MNr. PsIrpso-N (with whpom wasawiMnr. Erlwin James, Q C) contended that there had been no abolition of the office, an
that the prosecutor was not enrtited to aey compensation, not even to that which the council had awarded.
Lord CampbELL said he was of opinion that Mr. Lang. ridge was not entitled to the compensation which he claimed. Thha loe regretted, for it was clear that he had suffpine a material diminution of his profits, hut compensation had not been awarded by law. The statute ought to receive a liberal construction, for there could be no doubt that it was the policy of the Legislature, where improvements were made in the law, that compensation should be awarded when it was attendd by private loss. The question turned on the 66th section of the 5th and 6th of XVilliami IV., cap. 76, for the Manchester Act (the 16th and 17th of Vietoria) did not apply. The words relied upon were that the office had been " abolished," and unless that was the cae there was no right to compensation. His (Lord Campbell's) opinion was that Mr. L-ngridge's ffc was not abolished.ge e remained clerk op thgenpeace, and that not under a new, but under the old appointrnct. Ho hiad stil soeie duties to discrge asclerk of th peace within the limits of Brigheton, sch as the committal of persons for trwa at the quarter sessions, and the preparation of lists of voters for the county in Brighton. The offnc was_not abolished, but there was a dimiinution of its profits. The Legislature mightbhave used words to give compensation as was done in the 16th and 17th of Victoria, but it had not done so in this case, wuhiclh was a casus omMias

The learned counsel moved for the writ with a view to the prisoner's discharge from custody. The commiitment was founded on the Vagrant Act (the 5th Georgo IV., chap. 83, sodf. 4), which, among other things, declared that "every person playing& or bettingimanystreet, road, highway, or other open or public place, at or with any table or instrument of gaming, at any gamae or pretendedl game of chance," should be deemed to be a rogue and vagabond. The coin.- mnitinent followed the words of the statute, and stated that the said m. G. did play on ajcertaln high-ay, to wit, the
at the game of cards, &c. The learned counslsaidthocommitment was bad, first because, admitting the river to be a
public highway, it was not alleged to have been done pubicly; it might have been in a private yacht.
Lord CAIIPBELL said it was sufficient if it followed the words of the statute.
Mr. M'OUnBRY.-A second objection was that cards were not " instruments of gaming" within the act.
Lord CAMPBELL said there was no case to support that objection.
Mr, M'OUBBEY.-The third objection was that the Thames was not a public highway.
Mr. Justice COLERIDGE thought the Thames was a public highway where the offence was often committed.

The vendors of this pronerty caUed on the npplicanta' attorneys to complete the purchase, and they not Valg done so filed a bill in Chancery for a specific performance. Of this the attorneys for the appli. cant took no notice, and the applicant was surprised one morning by having served upon him an attachment for contempt of the Court of Chancery. This led to his making inquines, and the affidavits stated that the two sums of 6001. and 4001. had never been invested in the purchase of the property, but applied by the said attorneys to their own use; and the sum of 1,2001. had been lent on a deposit of title deeds, and the money repaid several years ago. The attorney now acting for the applicant bad applied to the said attorneys for an account of the moneys in their hands, but had not been able to obtain one, and the applicant swore that he believed the sum now due to him from the said attorneys was about 2,000!., which he was quite unable to &et, or any part of it.

This was a rule to enter the verdict for the defendants.
The action was brought on a contract to fit up a ship with berths as an emigrant ship at 15s. per statute adult berth, tho whole to be fitted up to the satisfac. tion of the Emigration Commissioners. The plaintiffs ab first fitted up 100 double berths, but were required after. wards to make more double berths and less single ones, and they claimed to be paid for these alterations and for certain other fittings made by them between decks. At the trial they had a verdict. It was now contended that the de. fendants were only liable for what was ultilaly done under the directions of the commissioners accordi g to the ct n'rcct.
Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Salter showed cause against the rule andlMr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Chandler sup. ported it.
The CoUTn were of opinion that the rule must be made absolute. The contract was to do everything that was necessary to fit up the ship as an emigrant ship, and it must be assumed that the plaintiffs undertook to do it according to law and the requirements of the statute. Defendants were not liable for anything done beyond the contract, and under the contract the plaintiffs were to be Paid at the rate of 15s. per statute adult for the work, which was to be done to the satisfaction of the commissioners, which the Court understood to mean for the number of adults provided for ultimately.

Mr. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for the plaintiffs, and 3Mr. Serjeant Thomas appeared for the defendants.
This was an action brought by tho plaintiffs, who are brewers, to recover from the defendants a sum of 281. 8s., for beer supplied at the St. George's Tavern, Camberwell, which publichouse the defendantshadbounht according to the case for the plaintifi, and into which they had put a man named Minton as their manager, for tho purpose of getting up the credit of the house and enabling them to sell it at a profit.
These facts and the liabilit of one of the defendants were clearly proved by the plaintiffs' witnesses. Their evidence was, however, so far as the material portiong of it are con. cerned, denied by the defendant Harden, and it also was shown that in their books credit was given to Minton. This latter contradiction was explained as arising from the fact that the name of the person holding the license and being the ostensible occupant of the publichouse was usually named in brewers' books.
MIr. PETERsDoRFY having replied on the whole case, and, in accordance with a suggestion from Mr. Justice Crowder, having elected to amend his declaration by striking out the name of one of the defendants, against whom there seemed to be very slight evidence,
The learned JUDGE summed up carefully, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs against the defendant Harden for 211. 8s. The sum of 5&, being admitted to be due from them by way of set off, was allowed in reduction of the or iinal claim of 261. Ss.

It appeared from the plaintif's case that he was a patentee of certain improvements in the manufacture of indiarubber articles. He had unfortunately become bankrupt in 1S55, but, having obtained his certificate, he apphed to the defendant to accept him as tena%t of a house in Basinghall. street. The defendant, being satisfied witk his reference;, had let the house to him, and the plaintiff had paid his rent regularly for the first two quarters. The third quarter, however, he was unable to pay when it became due, and the defendant called three times for it. On the third occasion he called the plaintiff a swindler, said that he was not worth a shilling, and that he never had paid his rent, and did not intend to pay it. The present action was brought in consequence of those words being uttered. The special damage alleged was that a person had intended purchasing a share in the plaintiffs patents, but in consequence of the words used by the defendant having been heard the negotiation was broken off. It was also sworn that a person who had rented some rooms in the plaintiff's house had also heard the words and had left, fearing that his goods would be scized to pay the rent.
The plaintiff and two other witnesses were called in sup. port of this statement.
The defence was that the defendant never did make use of the expression in question, and that no such words as alleged were used by the defendant. T'he real reason of the plaintiff's tenant leaving was the unfortunate state of the plaintiff's affairs.
The defendant was called and distinctly swore that he did not use the words as alleged. He had only called for his rent, and the plaintiff not ipaying him he left the houso without saying anything.
Mr. Baron BRAn&WxLL, in summing up, left it to the jury to say to which of the parties they gave credence. It was possible that one side or other had made a mistake, as both parties appeared to be respectable and were unlikely to tell the jury a wilful untrutb.
The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.

IS RE TIIE ROYAL BRITISII It kAN.
(Before Atr. Commrisnioae'. Hox-R n I1
This was a meeting for the proof of debts a;d declaration of dividend.
M,r. Linklater appeared for the as igne *, a;>l 'Ur. Lawrance, Mr. Chidley, M.r. Taylor, Mr. Cana, and ir. Greville for creditors.
A proof was tendered by Mfr. CA.NN oa account of a deposit note for 3001.
It appeared that the debt arose from a clwposit, in which the name of Mrs. Chipp has been frequenltly mentioned, and that Mr. G. B. Chipp, the originali epositor, had assigned the debt.
Mr. LiNItLATER said that in aU ca-ci of tlue transfers of debts it was the duty of the assignees to make dou. invostigation. The debt in this case had beeni sold to a third party. It was usual to have the signatures of all parties to the proofs.
An appeal to have this rule departed froin, or, the ground of hir. Chipp being abroad, was unsucet ;iul, and the debt was only allowed to be entered as a clail',.
The question next aroso, whether a creditor who hald paid Into the bank a certain amount on the 4th of September the bank having stopped payment on the :h of September, but the bankruptcy not having taken pl-ce until some time after the 4th of that month, could have the amount refunded?
It was decided that the amount must be proved as an ordinary debt.
Mr. LAWRANCE.-Would your Honour all,w me to apply for a summons a,gainst certain parties, w1vise names, for obvious reasons, I shall deoline now to men.tion, to attend the court for the purpose of explaining the mode in which they have been dealing with the debts due to creditors by takinkproceedings against individual sharehohler. ? Your
Bono~is aware that every creditor, in order to entitle him to proceed againat a shareholder through the offcial manager, must drst prove his debt in bankruptcy. There are 3nany cases in which creditors have so proved their debts, and, having proved them, have taken proceedings against the official manager, and having obtained judgment against the official manager they have then brought actions, or rather given notices, and obtained judgmnents upon sumnonsbefore one of the common law judges against individual shareholders. If the creditor had coulined himuself to the selection of a particular shareholder, and sought to enforce against him the payment of the balance of hi, debt after deducting the dividend-although the case would be still hard, yet I do not think that there would be anything to call for the interference of this court or to invite observation; but there are many cases in which attorneys, memb,rs of that branch of the profession to which I have the honour to belong, have so far forgotten their duties and profession as to make the powers of the statute in that respect convertible to the worst purposes. What I would ask is for summons against the attorneys and clients; and I think I shall be able to satisfy your Honouir, beyond the probability of doubt, that these gentlemen have obtained costs and gratuities, and their clieats sums on account-sullms, if not exceeding, at any rate amounting to the aggrigate of their debts. One wvas mentioned in my presence-the debt was 2001.-and I am in a position to prove that the gentleman has received, in that caso, from four different shareholders sums for costs and payments on account which actually exceed the amount of the debt, and yet he is proceeding aga.Vnst others. In another case, and while the application for the appointment of a receiver was being made before
te Lor Chancellor and Lord Justice Turner, 1 had an oppertunity of handing up to their Lordslhips 14 notices, resolvin1g themselves into executions against individual sbareho ders in respect of the same debt, issued by the same attorney, at the suit of the same plaintiff, agaiDst 14
ient shareholders, and I think I am not exaggerating the true state of things when I state that the costs incurred in respect of those notices would have amounted to very nearly as much as the debt would which was sought to be recovered thereby, and in many cases would exceed it; and in order to illustrate the outrageous enormity of that course of conduct, the notices-to give additional facility to the attorney-were actualUy lithographed, which would of course considerably multiply the number of copies intended to be issued. My application ia, that your Ionour would be pleased to grant me a sitting for the purpose of summoning before this court the attorneys and clients, for the purpose of knowing what sums they have received-the attorneys in the shape of costs, gratuities, or "hush" money, to induce them to stay proceedings against individual mareholders, and what sums the clients have received through the attorneys of shareholders, or from shareholders themselves, either on account or for the purpose of staying proceedings. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this question and the injury which it is doing, not simTplyto the shareholders, but to the creditors. ihap. pen to be engaged for shareholdors and creditors, butlI am here reresenitiag creditors, becaume it is only on behalf of ther,m3i' that I am entitled to ma-e thig application, although the shareholders are equaly to be cotnsidered on aU questions affecting the general interests of the estate. I say it is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this question, the effect of it being day by day and hout by hour to drive from the country the shareholders, who are not only able but anxious to pay and contribute towards the fund which is to be distributed for the purpore of satisfyiag them. Only last evening, at a meet g at which my frie'nd Mr. Linklater attended, repreaenting the assignees, for the purpose of furthAring the common object and so obtain the most for the creditors at the least possible sarHfice to the shareholders, one of the hareholders, who is in an excellent Position in life andB a man of considerable means, and who had by a course of industry for several years realized a considerable fortune, came into the room and said, IIAhl your deliberations are uiseless. I was yesterdaa served with six or se'ven different notices which a neighbur of mine had throw n over hisgarden waU, and which, no doubt, the process-server deemed to be good service ; for, while you Sre doirg what you can to raise contributions for the purpose of satisfying the creditors, I, who have the reputation of being wealthy, am being torn to pieces at the suit of indiividual creditors." This Court has no power -I wish it bad-to stay those proceedings but this Court has the power to give us the opportunity of lringing before the Court and the public the conduct of these men who, I say advisedly, and I would say if they wero here and would prefer saying it if they were here-and I would have mentioned their names publicly if notice had been given, are a disgrace to the P-rofession to which they belong. (Applause.) My application is that Your Honour would be kind enough to name a day on which I may sumnmon to attend before
on. these parties who have brought these proceedings against
dividual sbareholders.
Mr. LIvsnA_T'R.-I need scarcely say, onthe part of the assignees, that I concur in aU the observations that my friend Mr. Lawrance has made; and tho only question Fhichhas to be decided is the mode of proceeding. It seems to me that the assignees are scarcely the persons to take up the cudgel as it were for the shareholders; they are wiing to reader aLl the assistance they can to bring about the result which all are desirous to effect. There is no doubt that these proceedings against shareholders are most nefarious, conducted, as they have been, against individnais; and they are certainly anything but beneficial, either to shareholders or creditors themselves, and it is important that a}l the creditors should know that it is to their interest to abstain from proceeding against individual shareholders until it be seen whether the soheme which has been set on foot sll or shall not be successfuL The assignees are working With a committee of shareholders for the purpose of raising such a fund as it is anticipated will satisfy the creditors ; but that will be very much rustrated if in the meantime they are to be driven from their homes and have their peace of mind sacrificed by const,n,t litigation. It is most painful, and it must excite the sympathy of all, and the assignees are most anxious to do that can be done for the purpose of putting a stop to these proceedings It has been said that avereeiver should have bieen appointed for the purpose of preventing this individual litigation; but I am happy to say that this litigation arises, not from the general body of creditors, but it comes from a class of persons who have control over clients, and pursue those who are willing to contribute towards th general good. The non-appointmaent of a receiver is not attributable to anY fault on the part of the assignees ; but uLpon the best considerations they could gv th as he cg ame to the conclusioni that it would be betert=hath shareholders should meet for the parpose of raising a fund, and I doubt ifa receiver had been appointed that the object would have been attained. The committee is now sitting for the purpose of considering the schemes which are now laid before it, in which Mr. Wyld and others are aiding, and we hope to be able to come to and carry out such an arangeraent as will satisfy alL Bat if in the meantime individual creditors, or rather their solicitors, are to take proceedings againlst members of the company for the recovery of their debts, it i8 highly improbable that any Persons, howcverwell-intentioned, can carry outany such de. liberations so as to result in benefit to aUL I am willing to adopt any course the Court may suggest, but it seemus to mae that the shareholders are suffering from this more than the creditors, and I do not think that the costs of this should be borne by the assignees or the bankrupt estate.
The COMMsIos-IssE.-I do aot entertain a doubt about it being desirable to stop unnecessary litigation; there can be no question about that and everybody can feel for the position in which individnal shareholdersare placed by these proceedings; bet at theamtimeI feel boundto that the investigation which has been now sked for is one which I do not think can 1egit,nately come under the con.

tYlotti bankU lvautOY. It is an inquiry with which I think I have ao right to interfere. The same matter has
been brought before a much higher tribunal. I think it was mentioned before the Lord ChanceUor and Lord Justice ,Turner, and both of those learned judges found that they had no power to interfere and I certainly, therefore, do not entertain any doubt urn the subject with regard to the power of this Court. she object seems to be a desirable one if it would have the effect of stopping the proceedings, but it seems to mne that the object here is rather to expose the conduct of particular individuals who have occasioned the proceedings which have takenplacoe. Ihave no right here to review the conduct of individuals, over whose proceedings I have ao control; but if there were any creditors who ha4 proved under the bankruptcy, and at the sanne time were receiving money by reason of proceedings against individual shareholders, the assignees night have a right to inquire of those plItioujar creditors, if any stch there be, what they have b841 receiving from iadividual sharebolders.
M-. LAWIRtACE -It appears to inc that the same objection and difliculivy wou attend the selection of a particular case, calling upon the assignees to support an a U
cation to expunge the proof. If the a8signees declinod b do so, then at Is open fo anoy one or twvo shareholders, upon giving the usual undertaking, to call upon the creditor te show cause why his proof shoud not be expunged; and in support of that it would be open to me to show what had been paid in the shape of costs or gratuity, and it would be for the creditor to make out that he had not received more than lis debt.
The Co03hnsssoNzuR.-I do not think I have power to ascertain what money has been received by the creditor in
6iminution of his debt against the bank, and as to costs and so on.
Mr. LA,wP.AVCE.-I feel the difficulty the Court wouLd te placed in; but I shall reserve to mysclf the right whiich is given to me by the statute of selecting one or miore cases, and giving, if necessary, the required undertaking in orderl to expunge the proofs. Buit without putting the creditors to that expense the assignees have the power--
Mr. LsNKLATRar--The assignees muist give the under. taig an"d as my friend's clients a-re more interested in It than we are, if any expense should be icre tsol
not be borne by the assignees but by the individual share. holders.
Mr. IAWRAicCE.-There is no distinction as to assignees and creditors under the 183d section. That is a mat-ter for arrangement ;if the matter is to be donie it does not matter much whether it is done by miy friend or myself. We are all interested in reducing the proofs as miuch as possible, and it is desirable also f or the shareholders who are having proceedings taken against them to know whether the debt has been fullvy satisfied ; and, if niot, w-hat portion of it remains unpaid. Your Honour will, I hope, pardon me for making the application, hut I feel so strongly the conduct of somne practitioners in this ease that I shall take every opnortunity, even at the risk of wearying the Court, of bringisig the facts promninently before your Honour.
Mr. Engart was htere called. He saidI he bed instructedl proceedings to be taken. Ho did not know the namnes of the shareholders against whom proceedings had been taken, Nothing had been done. Mlerely notices had been given ; nothing further.`. About four or five notices had been given. Mr. Moore, of Mark-lane, was his attorney. Nothing had been don esne. He had no intention of going on unless he did not get paid.
Mr. LJNisLATEn.-Sir, now the business of the mneet. ing is at a conclusion, but I think it moay be well to state tha"t the proofs to-day amount to about 160,0001., the proofs of creditors not taken at the last meeting, and we shall be able to pay the same dividend t-o them that we paid to the former creditors---namely, 5s. 6dl. in the pound. There are about 1,000 of these creditors, and the former proofs amounted to 2,200. I may take this opportumsty of stating that there was some complaint made with reference to an inconivenience sustained by some of the creditors at the receipt of their dividends on the last occasioni but it may readllY be under-stood that, notwihtnigalte exertions whichi were made on the pas ofteasge n i lerks, and more especially I may sa fM.Coe n h messenger of the Cour-t-notwitsadn!hi eiet do all they could fokr the convenineoth crdos,t was found at first that the mnachinery was scarcel in proper order ; however, on the seconid daythng wont on very smoothly, and the creditors- recve their dividends without any inconvenience. Anid I do not doubt but that the mieans which were then adopted will be taken on Saturday in the next week, as that will he the first day, I think, on which the further dividend will be paid; and having regardI to the fact that so many warrants hiave to pass through the accouintant's office, we hadl better say also on
Moda and Tuesday, as probably it wil be better to extendito three days. Then some little complaint was made tha,t the dividendl of Bs. (3d. in the pound was pad At the0 last meeting to those whio had then proved; buti it would have been manifestly unjust to those who had comie in first that they should have been delayed for the thiree weeks which must necessarily have elapsed, so as to have allowed the fresh creditors to comae in and prove. All will be now placed on an equality. I believe I may say that all the debt;, or nearly all, are proved, with a very sliglist exception, under thie estate. The amount on the formner occasion was 360,0001., the amounit on the present occasion will be about 160,01101.; so that we have proofs to the amiount of 510,0001. or 520,6001. ; and I do not anticipate that thrsee figures wil be altered in any great degree; probably only between 5,0001. or 6,0001. more may be uld mately proved against the estate. We are in expectati,n, ha'ving regard to the realization of the, property which is now freed from all liability, and we hsope to be able to make a further dividend among the creditors at the end of another month. And although it has been said else-where that this estate is to lose the benefit of the Welsh mines-which are supposedl to be of so much value, and, undoubtedly, they are valuable--I ans happy to say that though the representations which have gone forth to the public, that the leases of these imines are forfeited by ankr cty, although true in fact, and would be e9ually forSeited unider the winding up, Mlr. Talbot has k-indly consented to waive all forfeiture either under the bankruptcy or the winding utp, and lie iLs quite willing to acecept any tenant the assignees can find who masy be wN g to take the property from us. It is very desirable, and no doubt seine capitalist will be found ore long who will pay the price which the assignees may think reasonable. We are already treating and negotiating, and we hope that the result wil be successful to the estate. Allusion has been made to the litigation which is pending, but may I take this opportunity of saying-and I am happy to say it -that there is no litigation whatever pending at the instance of the asignees, beyond the mere ordinary legal proceedings which are necessary for the administratson of the estate? And, looking to thxe future, I may say that I see no reason to anticipateo that there will be litigation with any one. The great object of the assignees is, that the assets should be realised and divided assedily as possible among the creditors, and that therea shul be no difficulty or litigation about it whatever. The dividend to be paid has been aided by the funds of the shareholders themselves, who have a committee for aiding in carrying out the schlerae which has been suggested on the part of the assignees, who have takenx infi. nite pains and trouble to bring about some arrangement between the shareholders and the creditors. Tho litigation which has been going on between the individual creditors has been alluded to. if course I needI scarcely say that the assignees have been unable to see their way to afford any protection to the shareholders, In fact, the law does not give them vwer ; but most assuredly the litigation by indi.
vinlcre -tors is not attributable to the bankruptcy, because, under the winding-uji, the shareholders weuld be left at the mercy of everycredatorwhocboseto tke any kind of proceeding against them. The bankruptcy has, however, effected onuegreat object, as there has been an equal and a
speydistribution. Under the winding-up there would shpavebeden a race among the creditors for the property, and we should not have had the power by law to equalize the assets among those who came to claim uande-r the bankruptcy. I should state, also, with reference to the call which has been made, that there has been some misapprehension as to the obj'ect the sine had in preveniting the disclosure of theeamntosoidvul shareholders.lI has boon intimatd a laeseiin print-not thatthere is any particuLlar mai in that; but, still, print goes forth to the public-I hav seen it observed that the consequence of the withholding oftese examinations from the public wil deprive them o h benefit of investigating and Imowing the affairs connece with the bank and its formation, which it is very desirable should be published to the world. I may confidently say in your Honour's presence, and subject to correction, that the effect of withholding these noraceedings is nothing of the kidnd ; it is merely withlsolaig from the public, in all probability, what, if published to the world, would be injurious to a saraeholder witli reference to his pecunmary meatns and ability to meet every call,-a call madse, not by the assignees, as has been erroneously supposed, but a call made before the bankruptcy, which is a debt due froma the shareholders to thke bank, jus't as miuch as any debt is due from a person on a cash credit account or any security the hank niight hold, and which call the assignees have been bouxnd by la-w to enforce payment of as far as the7 could. In the exercise of that duty they have desired to spre pain to the shareholders, which would not result to the, advantage of the estate, and it .has been found more consistent in common fairness that these gentlemen, on being broiught here for the purpo so of showing cause why they should not pay the call which in due from them to the bank, should not have their names paraded before the public in order that they might be made a mark or target te be signalled out immediately as a person against whomaproceedings should be commenced. That has been the ony object of the assgnees. They intend fairly and without favour or affection to pursue these inquiries, which it is their bounden duty to prosecute, and there is no man, high or low, who wl escape that'vigilant investigation which the assignees have instructed us to prosecute on behalf not only of thesufrn creditors, but of the suffering share. holders generally; and itis tobe hoped that this bankruptcy wil have the effect hereafter of preventing the possibility of a recurrence of that whiceh has been so disastrous to thousands. I have felt it my dutty on the part of the assignees to make thes observations, because many steps through this bankruptcy have been so mlisunderstood, aad parties really have not had regard to this important fact, that the creditors themselves are the persons, and naot the assi&nees or any other individuals, who consider that the administration in bank.ruptcy would be best an t has in the result shown to be for the interest of the creditors.
The Co i,ssao.cun.H]Eavyoyotany calculation ma6deas to the future amount of assets -yeu will he able to collect in the bankruptcy?
Mr. LiNicuAT.-~rI am m ruch obliged to your Honour for putting that question to mue as I intended to make an observation upon t ht which I had forgotten. The official aRsignee at present has in hand abouat, I should say, 50,0001. The 5s. (3d. paid toth creditors upon'that 1(30,0001, would amount to about 428,0001 or 43,0001. ; it would leave therefore in hanid about 7,0001.

day or two out of the 20,0001. which has been obtained, and very shortly, as soon as3 the calls have beent obtained by himn, another sum of 5,0001. will be handed over, so that we shall get upwards of 16,0001. from the official manager. Within a week or 10 days, or perhaps rather more than that, and as soon as that is done, with the realization of the property of Mr. Humphrey Brown and other securities which the assiignees have at their disposal, we hope by the end of the month of Feb. rubs-y to make another di-vidend.

In EZ JOHN PAUL,
An adjudication of bankruptcy was made against John Paul, oF Bedford, and 51, St. Mary-Axe, corn and seed merchant, and whose alleged defalcations in connexion with the City Union frauds have excited so much attention. It would appear that this is the third bankruptoy. in 1827 raul was bankrupt as a sniller, of Newport, Isle of W3ht. The amount of the bankrupt's debts or the amount of ividend paid under that baiiruptOy cannot be ascertained.
InSOZPao was again adjudicated bankrupt as a commission caugentand lour. fctor,aof 3n7, incing-lfane, au 14, Old libiiie sse ti bnruty were about 1,500.°, and
the assets were returned at 751. It does sot appear, however, that anything was realized, as the %igrture of the official assignee is affixed to a statement tba- he bas not received any funds and does not expect to receive any.
The present petition, in conformity with a rule to that effect, goes to the same court as that of 1837-to the court of Mr. Conmissioner Goulburn, and Mr. Pennell is the official assignee. The amount of the bankrupt's liabilities and assets cannot at present be ascertained with an approximation to accuracy. The latter, however, is said to include a stock of choice wine.
Mr. Henderson, of 22, Leadenhall-street, is the solicitor in the case.

Insolvent Debtors' Court, Jan. 24.
I INSOLVENT DEBTO.RS' COURT, Jan. 24.
TN bR V.,A.-- -r -
(Beforc .i. Commiesionei PmT.Lur-.)
In this case Mr. Parry, a creditor, applied that the insolvent might be required to fulfil an undertaking made at the hearing. The Insolvent, an actor, was heard in 1854, and then engaged to pay 50?. a-year from his professional earnings towards the liquidation of his debts. Mr. Parry said he was informed that onily a small sum had been paid, and as Mr. Dillon was now the lessee of the Lyceum Theatre, and in appasently prosperous circumstances, he thought the payments ought to be regularly made.
Tho Registrar informed the Court that 381. had been paid by Mr. Dillon, and a dividend of Is. 4d. in the pound was about to be paid.
Mr. Commissioner Pnsmurs said if the insolvent had not kepb up his payments his protection had ceased, and he was at the mercy of his creditors.
The Registrar said that was the case, and, in fact, he believed Mtr. Dillon had been served with two writs by creditors.
The learned Co'.%nIssIoNms thought the best course would be to summon Mr. Dillon to show cause why he had nob carried ouat his engagement, and made an order to that effect.

POLICE.
M,sNsi-orsnousZ.-Oxx Saturday Wiliam Heron, a ticketof-leave man, was brought before the LORD MAYOR for final examination charged with having robbed a great many lads of various parcels which they were carrying in the streets.
He pleaded " Guilty," and was fully committed.
WiMiam Henry Scott, late cashier to Messrs. Yeats and Co., wholesale provision merchants, was finally examined upon the charge of embezzling the money of his employers.
Mr. Wontner apueared for the prosecution.
It will be recollected that a few days since the prisoner was witness against a man named Hardcastle on a charge preferred by the same prosecutors for embezzling upwards Of 2001, He wasshortlyafterwardsgiven into custody upon the present charge.
J. Ilees, shopman to ?5r. Dunnell, a cheesemonger in OlD Fish-street, said,-We deal with Mossrs. Yeats and Co. On the 2Sth of April, 1855, I paid the prisoner on account of his employers the sum of 121. 12s. 6d., for which he gave me the receipt produced. On the 6th of May, 1855, 1 paid him a further sum of 131. 12s. 9d., for which I also produce his receiPt
Mr. G. Simmons, a cheesemonger, living at 43, Upper Iasson-steeet, Lisson-grove, said that on the 15th of August last he paid the prisoner on account of Messrs. Yeats 401., for 'which the receipt was produced.
Mr. Copeman, one of the prosecutors, before iving his evidence, said he wished to correct a report which had gone forth to the public to the effect that it was his comumercial traveller whom he had charged on a former occasion with embezzlement. It was not his commercial traveUer, who was a highly respectable man, but Hardcastle, who was now awaiting his trial in Newgate. Mr. Co man then said,-1 have examined the cashbook which was kept by the prisoner, but I find no entry of the sums of 121. 12s. Sd., 131. 12s. 9d., and 401. referred to by Mr. Rees and MIr. Simmons. It was the prisoner's duty to enter them there and afterwards to pay them into the bankers'. I produce the ledger, and upon referring to Mr. Dunnel's account I find an entry of 261. 9s. 7d. as paid on the 30th of April, 1855, but there is no corresponding entry in the cashbook. The sum of 261. 9s. 7d. would mak the account balance against the two sums of 121. 2s. 6d. and 131. 12s. 9d. without the discount. Upon referring to Mr. Simmons's account I find an entry in the ledger of a sum of 401. on the 5th of August, 1856, to the credit of the account, but there is no corresponding entry in the cashbook.
R. Thurlow, city police-constable, No. 457.-I took the prisoner into custody on the 20th inst., and charged him with embezzling 2501. belonging to his employers. I asked him if he had anything to say, and he replied "N Iot anything.")
The prisoner, who said he did not wish to say anything at present in answer to the charge, was fully committed to the Central Criminal Court.
GummDrTAT.-Mr. Surr Edward Pack Barber, the secretary to the Samaritan Institution, appeared before Sir B. W. CARDEN in answer to several charges of obtaining goods under false pretences with intent to defraud Messrs. Hoare and Co., of Lower East Smithfield Messrs. Manners and WeUs, of Whitechapel; Messrs. ifmtley and Palmer, of MiReadin; and Mess. Ponsford and Co., of the City Flour
llsBlackfrimr.
The defence having been gone into Pnd coneluded,
Sir R. W. CA-RDZN summed up the evidence at some length, and concluded by saying-I have devoted a great portion of time to the investi gtion and consideration of the present charge, and I may havo been subjected to some misapprehension in my anxiety to arrive at the truth amid confcting testimony of the most painful description. Itisno partof my duty to considerthe consequencestothe prosecutor or the accused, but to determine impartiaUy the legal effect of the evidence on either side. To support a charge of obtaining goods by false preteces it is not sufficient to show that they have been obtained upon a fraudulent promise to make a particular use of them hereafter. Whatover therefore, may be my opinion of the defendant's conduct, and however deserving of reprobation it may be, I do not think I should be justified in sending him for trial on the charge before me. The defendant is therefore dismissed.
Bow-S=R=T.-Mr. Dwelly, the Excise solicitor, attended to support a summons against William Clark, keeper of the Alma coffeehouse, in Castle-street, Leicester-square, for selling gin without a license.
A charge was waived by the prosecution.
Mr. HENRY considered that no mercy ought to be shown to such dishonest traders, and fined the defendant 501.; and would have inflicted the same penalty in the second case if it had been proceeded with.
A notoriousbegging-letter impostor named Thomas Rogers has been remanded on a charge of defrauding Mr. H. Thomas, solicitor, of Lincoln's-mn-fields, of 11. Thepri. soner represented himself as the local carrier of the district in which the complainant resided (atSydenbam), and stated that his horse took fright at a railway engine sometime ago, and, dashing oal at a fearful pace, smashed the cart all to pieces, illed itself, and caused him (prisoner) to be connined inthe hospital with a broken leg. A forged letter from the local clergyman and a sham list of donations from the gentr were te means of deception employed.
M&RLDo Ou"H-sTREET.-From "G. H." 51. have been received for the poor-box.
XArYLEnONB.-A man named Gibbons, a cabman, was placed at the bar before Mr. Loss, chargei (on remand) with having assaulted by the dastardly garotte system John Bean, residing in Catherine-place, Market-street, Pad-
Ta pri60ner was upon the first occasion brought up by Sergeant Bewley, 349 A, from whose statement the remand took place. It appeared that on Thursday mrnoring while on duty in Cambridge-terrace, Paddinlgton, he heard loud cries of "Mturder P,' aud
"PolicelI" and on hastening to the spot whence the sounds proceeded he sawthe prisoner with his hands in the neckerchief of the prosecutor, who was evidently in extreme pain from the tightness of the grasp and the twisting round of the neckerchief alluded to. He (witness) released him when in an almost fainting and helpless condition, and having secured the prisoner conveyed him to the stationhouse. He wae brought up to the court the next day, but the prosecutor -was then too ill to attend,
me now came forward this day (Saturday) to give evidence as to the atrocious nature of the outrage upon him.
Mr. Hardley attended for the Prisoner.
Prosecutor on being sworn said,-On Thursday morning last, at about 3 o'clock, as I was going along Sale-street towards my home, the prisoner came up and faced me and, grasping me tightly by the neckerchief, anr
pressing his knuckles as hard as he could against my throat, at the same time exclaimied " Now your money or your life!" I was nearly strangled; but.I was able to speak as to tell him that I bad no money. He then remarked I"Money I want, and money I must have; and if you have
not got a shilling or two, you must give me 4d., or somethingelse." Ihadatthetimebetween7s ando Limmpoeket, Lof whichlshouldno doubt have been robbed, had not %rgeant Bewley, who heard my cries, come up to my assistance. I suffered considerably the whole of the next day from the violent treatment to which I had been subjected. When at the station-house the prisoner used towards me very threatening lnnguage,
Evidence of a corroborative nature as to the assault upon the prosecutor was given.
The witnesses were cross-examined by Mfr. Eardley, with the view of showing that the proseoutor and a woman named Clara Brodie had been drinking together at the Pineapple publichouse, and that afeer leaving there the charge, which was quite unfounded, was made.
The Magistrate, after hearlng the whole of the evidence which had been adduced, and listening to all that bad been ur$ed by Mr. Hardley on behalf of his client, committed the prisoner for trial for assaulting, with intent to rob.
Mr. Hardley applied for the prisoner to be allowed to put in bail, but h. ,ONG refused to accede to the request.
WESST ATE.-George Thomas Sambrook, a stoker at Messrs. Thorne's ale and porter brewery, Earl-street, Westauinster, was fimnlly examined, charged with attempting to stab Mr. Thomas Young, brewer there.
He was fully committed for trial at the Central Criminal Courts
WoRsmip-Sm ET.-Jame; Coles, a well-dressedl youth, of 16, apparently the son of a respectable tradesman, was charged before mr. HAsxs , on his own confession, with the followlng robbery.
Brown, a constable of the x division, stated,-While on duty last night, in the hile-end-road, I saw the prisoner loitering about for at least two hours and noticed him mnore or less up to half-past 12 o'clock, when he cme *ap to me and gave himself into custody upon the charge of stealing a watc . I questioned him about it, and he told me be had stolen the watch from Mr. Stevenson's, a silversmith, in the I Bethnal-green-road, that he had asked the first working-
Suan he muet to pledge it for him, that the man did so for 30s., handing him the money, and that the watch was then at te shop of a pawnbroker named Hawes, to which hplasce hte daccompanied me, aud I found it all exactly as he
illiam Fayerlrother, assisant to Mr. Hawes.-I produce the watch referred to, which was pledged at our house on the 14th in8t., by a man who ave the name of Jackson, and the urisoner certainly is not that man.
h.r Itich.td Stevenson, the pros#eotoy,.- knowr ths
prisoner's parents from their purchasing articles at uiy shop, and also from their calling at my hou1s a few days before
the 13th and askingineif the prisoner caine to buy or look a; a watch or othergoods mot to let him have them. On the 13th he did come, and asked to look at somle watches, which I told him he could not do, unless bis father o. mother came with him. Ile said it was all right, and I having ben induced to show him some, le apparently selected one worth 41. 10a, but suddenly opened the door, and the next moment I saw him pass the window with the watch in his band. I could not pursue him, as I was serving a customer, an dnot gcinformation to the polee, although I con-
d hc nad really stolen the wiatch. I don't knoxv where his parents reside, but I thought I shonld hear more about it.
Prisoner.-I am guilty of this robbery. I had a quarrel with my father and mother, and determined to get a situation. They did not want me to do so, and, when I got a place at a coffeehouse my father was anxious I shoulll not take it; but I did take it, and then had a qaarrel with my master, and left him. I bad behaved very badly to my father, and when I went back home he td u.e to return to my place, that he would not have me tlhere, and, in fact, he turned me out. I told him I would go and steal something and get into prison, and I stole this watch. I never saw the man before who pledged it for me, but he gave me the 30s., and after I had spent it, having no home to go to and no means of living, I -wandered about the streets, and put myself in the way of the police that they might suspect and ask me what I was doing. I did so lamt night, but the police did not interfere, and I therefore at last went up to the officer and gave myself into custody.
MIr. HAEMLL.-~AIO your parents here ?
Prisoner.-No, Sir; and I shall not disgrace them by telling where they live, or wvho they are.
Mr. 1I a5L.-~Well, this is a clear case of robbery, and I shall sentence you to four months' hard labour in the House of Correction.
The prisoner received the sentence as one that he appeared to have anticipated.
CLERXvEWELT.-A short, well-dres3ed young man, of entlemaaly manners, apparently about 24 years of age, aescribed as a surgeon, residiag at No. 15, Frederick-place, Goswell-road, was charged with tmlawfully attempting to extort money by threatening to publish a libel against a gentleman residing in Lincolushire.
It appeared that the prisoner had advertised constantly that he was able to cure certain diseases, and in this case, the prosecutor having communicated certain private facts to him, the prisoner wrote back to him and threatened that, unless prosecutor paid him a douceur of 251., he would publish the letters to the world. In conseiLuence a warrant was placed in the hands of Police-constable 'ompkin, 315 N,,who went in plain clothes with another constable to the prisoner's house, where they saw his wife. One of the constables said he had something the matter with him and wished to consult Dr. Hall. The prisoner's wife stated that he was absent from home, and upon being pressed as to his return she said he was gone into the country upon a professional tour. The constables then stated who they were, and that they had a warrant against him (te prisouer). Upon heating this she immediately touched a spring in the wall, and a bell rang loudly at the end of a passage. The got into the paswage, and searched the house over, but coud not find the prisoner. When they returned and saw his wife, she exclaimed, ' Ab, ab, you may think yourselves clever, but you will not fild him. He is not in the house now; he has baffled you, and yo. will never take him as long as you live." Determined not to be done in this way, the constables again went into the drawing-room, which was elegantly furnished, and after searching for some time, they knocked the fiooring, a,d fancied they discovered a hollow sound. They looked further, and found a trap door, which they lifted up, and nnderneath they perceived the prisoner crouching down in a corner. He refused to come up, so they dragged him out fby his collr, and took himt to the station The police wished
Mr. Ty-wrr said that the accused was a sharp, acute, and shuffling ustomer, and he had no hesitation in remanding him till Wnednesday next.
SOUTWAR -Mr. BuRCH&M received a 5. Bank of England note from "H. P.," and Is. 6d., from Mr. Miles Doughty, chvminst, in the Blackfriars-road, allowed him as expenses ian attending a coroner's inquest, for the poor-box of this court.
LA.B2rrs.-Richard Smith, a powerful man, in the garb of a sailor, who bas lost his right arm in the late war from the elbow downwards, was placed at the bar before the Ron. G. C. NORTON on a charge of having caused the death of William Kieffe, ClioS the Pecker, by violence. The investigation occupied the magistrate for nearly two hours, but the short facts appeared to he these. On boxing night Rieffe, who used to ob about the neighbourhood, was at the Edinburgh Castle pubichouse, at Peckham, and on the folowing morning was found in the stable-loft belongig to Mr. Da - the landlord, with a serious wound on the top of his head and otherwise injured, so as to be in a dangeroas state and was at once removed to CamberweU worrhouse, vhere he lngered for about a fortnight, and then died. An inquest was subsequently held on The body, and from the eidence then adduced the opinion was that he had without permission got over the gates of Mr. Davis's stable
ard, and while nounting the adder to get to the loft had allen and got kicked on the head by one of the horses, and a special verdict was glveni to the effect that Kieffe's death had been caused by the wound on the head, but how that wound had been inflicted there was no evidence before them to show. Sinoe the inquest various mramours had been in circulation attributing the death of the deceased to the prisoner, who had been acting as potman and ostler to the Edinburgh Castle, and in consequence of such rumours Mr. Davis discharged him, and Inspector Silver felt it to be his duty to take hima into custody.
A witness named Osborn said that on boxing night he was at the Edinburgh Castle, sad saw the deceased there. Between U1 and 12 o'clock- he (witnes) 'went to the urinal, which Is situated between the house and the stables, and while there heard the voice of a man, who he knew to be the deceased, in the stable yard say, " Don't, don't." A scuffle appeared to him to ensue, and immediatelyafter he heard a blow struck, and something fail heavily. He called out, "What are you about with Pecker?" the name the deceased went by, and he heard the tread of footsteps moving about. He also heard something heavily drawn along towards the stable, and soon after the gate opened, and a taL man, dressed in dark clothes, came out and ran away. When asked why he did not attend the coroner's inquest on the deceased, or disclose the facts just mentioned by him, the witness replied that he was reluctant to interfere in the matter, an hopedthe facts would come out in some othervway; but added that his life had become a perfect burden to him, and his mind so wretchedly unhappy that he had determined to relieve himself from the weight upon his conscience and told his shopmates,and since then he was a very different man as his mind was at rest.
Alexander, an aged pauper, who was in the same ward with the deceased romte time of his being brought to the workhouse up to his death deposed that Kieffe told him the injuries upon his head lad been done with a mallet on boxing night.
Mrs. Gardener, the nurse who attended the deceased, also said thiat Xieffe told her that he knewv he ws dying, and did not wish to implicate or hurt anyone, but that the blows on his head had been done with a mallet by " Jack," and on the pnsoner caiing to see him eoin outas the man.- tehmou
The prisoner here said that this must be quite wrong, as he went by the name of "Dick," and not " Jack."
Mr. Davis, the landlord of the Edinburgb Castle Tavern, Peckham-rye, was next examined, and deposed that the prisoner had jobbed about his house for some months, and was first engaged in the cricket ground near the end of the season. About Christmas his pOtman left, and the prisoner was employed in his stead, and he besides attended to the stables. On boxing day, he (Mr. Davis) saw Kieffe, the deceased, at his house. He came there drunk, with his face blacked over with soot, as if seme persons had been larking with him, and wanted to go into the taproom, but he witnessV objected to his doing so, and offered to give ini hak-a-pmt of porter If he went away and got home. Keffe said e ehou d do so, and he gave him thebeer when he left, but he understood he had been in the taproom after that. At this time there were two carriage-horses in his stable to be attended to, and he (ar. Davis) recoleeted the prisoner asking him for the keys of the stable yard gate, so that he might be enabled to attend them early on the following morning without knocking him or his servants up to receive the key. He (Mr. Davis) went to town on the following day (Saturday), and did not hear anything of the affair until his return homo on the Saturday night.
Mr. NORToN..-Are you aware whether the prisoner and the deceased were on good terms?
Mr. Davls.-I amnot, your Worship, but never heard of any disagreement between thema. I found failt with the prsoner for notmaing me acquainted with the fact the moment he found Kieffe on the pemises on the Saturday morninug, and from this and also from the various reports in
te net' burhood, and also the various contradictory statements, I discharged the prisoner on Mfonday last, and he
ten said he should come to this court and clear his cha-
Prisoner.-And so I did, and saw Mr. Elliott, but he told me he could do nothing for me.
Mr. NOsToN.-Do you think it likely, Mr. Davis, that Kieffe, in the state he was in, could get over your stable yard gates?
Mr. Davis,-I do not think it possible, your Worship, s they are nine feet high ; but it is difficuta to say what a drunken man will not do, and I have been informed that he has got into the yard before.
A large mallet with a handle to it about two feet long waa here produced, which had been found in the stable on the Saturday merning, and Mr. Davis said it was used in the season for driving tent pegs, and that one of the stalls in the
ne as the Place it was usually kept in.
Ist ecwtr Silver Informed the Magistrate that he had examnmed the ladder leading from the stable to the loft where Kieffe had been found, mad observed distinct marks blood on it,
The prissner declared his perfect innocence of the charge, but wras remanded to give the officers aopportunity of making further inquiries into the matter.
Mr. SORTON, however, said he had Do objection to accept two sureties in fiOI. each for his attendance on a future

Sir,-In your paPer of the 22d inst. wo see that the first witness examinled, Mr. S. Draper, stated that in the beginning of 1856 ho advertised for a situation, that he received an answer, in consoquence of which he went to 32, lemanstreet, asked for a person named Davis, that he was taken to a person who answered to that name, &c. We beg to say that the witness must have made a mistake with respect to the place, as we have occupied these premises for the last 10 years, and nso such occurrence ever took place at our house. We should t'erefore feel ohliged if you would give this contradiction a place iunyourcolemnn.

The Arch-Impostor, Alice Grey.-We stated
Tux AcH-IiosoR Ali CE GREY.-We stated on Saturday last the particulars of a gross imposition practised by Amelia Elza Tremane, auias Emma Smith, alfu Mary Eliza Tesle, atias Miss look upon Mr. John Clough, publican, of Ferry-hill, near Darham, at whose table she lived for some time on the strength of a romantic story about having escaped from a convent in Franco, being the daughter of a gentleman named Teale, living at Cheltenham, and berself the ownerof extensive estates in the south of Eng. land. For robbing the too credulous Mr. Clough she is now in tho Leeds Borough Gaol, awaiting trial at the next sessions. Since her committal the Loeds police have ascertained that she has been imprisoned m various gaols throughout the coun rfor obtaining money and oods by false pretences, Mr. Valker, superintendent of the Kent polioe, stationed at Canterbury, has written to say that she
as been in several prisons in that part of the country sinco ber first afearance in Leeds as " iss Hook, niece of Dr. Hook.P" In December, 18w, she was sentenced to two months'hardlabour for stealingbooks. She then called herself Mary Eliza Field, and was taken into oustody charged with stealing a child named Nugent. Of this offence, however, she was acquitted, but convicted of stealing two books. She was also convicted of larceny at Liverpool in September, 1848; and in the south of England was guilty of a s'ries of successful frauds in the name of MIarEliza Chip. pendale, From Durham Mr. Superintendent Grauban has a letter stating that, prior to Mr. Clough being victimized, she d obtained from a poor widow in Durham a snm of money by false pretences; and a communication ha been receied from the Hon. and Rev. 1. J. Duncombe, rector of Sigston, nearNorthallerton, requesting herdetenti onmaanimpostor. Although there is no positive proof of the fact, it is statedthatthis accomplished id=ostorappeared atDarlington some 18 years ago, When she called herself emSe and professed to be a Moravian. She attracted the attention of ,everal respectable persons of that denomination at Darlington. They were scarcely satisfied that she was not an impostor, but charitably took pity upon her and put her to a good school in the neighbourhood. Here, h,w.v,r, uhe was discovered to be so great a liar and so ine ortW, a, thief that sbe was dsmissed in disgrace, and it in ; that during the intervening 18 years she bas been lg a 1vng by f-azd and im Dsture. Among other thiisps aUdbutea to her Lre a coupl of frAuds practised In Ltds five or six years ago. At that time a Woman, suppo.d to be the prisoner, was recommended to 1M. Clrke, of the BuU and Mouth Hotel, Briggate, as a most deserving and accom-
lishedprson, sering great distre M Chrke took er Into her house, *nd, as she professed a knowkwdDe of French and music, proposed to em ploy ler in the tuition of the children. In a day or two afterwards, however, Mr
Clarke ascertained that the woman was in the labit of gog into the treetsand simulating fainting fits to excite commiseration, and at once sentier away. Soon afterwards she was founcl in a6 fainting state upon the doorstep of a lady named Hunter, In Cobmng-street. She was taken into the houso and generously provided for. She told a most thrilling story of the cruelty of Mrs. Clarke, and was aboutto be engaged as instructor of the Mimses Hunter, -when her real character was fortunately discovered and she waS again sent adrif t-Zccdi Mercury of Saturday.

Another Experience Of Woolwich.
ANOTHER EXPERIENYCE OF 1YOOLIVICn.
TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES.
Sir,-On reading a letter in lZee Times of yesterday signed Viilcan," I thought it my duty to give you tlle resulr of my own experience with the authorities at Woolwich.
At the commencement of the late war I noticed in your journal the loss and destruction caused by the bursting of the Lancaster guns, by killing and injuring those who used them, besides the loss of the gun itself, after the great labour aud expense of getting it in position. Having been in the lhabit of strengthening cylinders of cast iron for hydraulic presses so as to bear tbree times their original power, I considered, and then matured a plan by which the same desirable object might be eflected on pieces of ordnance; I suggested that a series of wrought iron bands bored, heated, and shrunk on tbe gun, which had been previously turned paralel to receive them, would, if properly executed according to a plan I laid downi, add to the strength of the guns nearly three times, without inereasing their size or altering their appearance. I immediately wrote explaining the method and its advantages to his Royal Highness Prince Albert, wiso took a very favnu-able view of it, and recommended nse to bring it before the authorities at Pall-mall. I applied to them accordingly, offering thetu the thing unconditionaUy without honiour or reward. After seine considerable delay I received a reply declining the matter. About six months subsequently I accidentally met Captain Addison, whom I had a few years before assisted to mature a furnace for heating cannonl bals, a machine now in use. He at once saw its importantce, and went to Lord l'anmure, from whom lie obtained an order for me to be furnished with a gun for ume to operate upon. I then fetehed a 12-
pounder gun, and carried out mny improvements upon it.
On taking it to WYolwich it remained unnoticed for nearly three months, but when it was tried it proved-my calculations were correct, as it bore all the trials to which it was subjected; and I asi inclined to think they were rather formidable, as all its neighbours, wvhile undergoing the same ordeal, went to pieces, including, I believe, the wroughtlion gun spoken of by yoour correspondent " Vulean V" and they have still the gun in their possession, and, I am informed uninjured. The last I heard of it was that it was to be taken to Shoeburyness for further trial.
I was subsequently requested to attend the " select conimittee" to give information; I attended accordingly, and was examuin,ed (if you may call a few irrelevant lquestions for about six or seven mninutes by three of the board at one end of the room ani examination), but the ab)ject appeared new to them and the important and scientifio part of the matter wae not touched upon at all.
As I expected, I received a letter from them refusing its adoption. I certainly did feel regret at their decision, seeing that this very committee were at that very moment authorizing the expenditure of thousands upon thousands in the macaufacture of wrought-iron conical shells for the Lancaster guns, which are now oiily of the value of old iron, without having a single gun in the service from which they couild with safety be propelled.
Any manufacturer who neglected to avail himself of an invention which not only saved expenise but produced a superior article would soon go to the rear. On what -principle, I shouild like to know, do these people act ? I am well assured that had my ideas been acted upon at the first there would have beezi a c,.nehlesable saving of life and labour, besides a large sum of mosey in t he purcha&e of now guns, vhich they were at that tinme obtaining ill large quantities, they havinig iinany thousands lying at the arsenal only as old iron, whicb, at about the fourth of the cost of nevv, would have rendered further purchase uinecessary, besides producing an " armi possessing a power of range inknown to tLe service or that of any Power in Europe. This identical plans w%ill be sooneror later adopted, as no other will be fouiid po.ssessing at the same timze so great an iacrease of poyer with so senall a cost.

Crystal Palace Concerts.
CRYrSAL PALACB CONCERTS.
The musical performances in the new concert room,
under the direction of Herr Manns, go on much as usual,I and attract about the same attention as from the outset.
At the 11th concert, on Saturday afternoon, somethir.g approaching to exoi tement was created by Miss Lonis3a Vinning, who may recently be said h have made a adden leap from obscurity into notoriety through her aparance as substitute for Mrs. Clare Hepworth at the Sacred Har. monic Society. Incapacitated by illness, and consequent nervousness, from proceeding with the soprano music in Hande's messiah, Mrs. Hepworth wax forced to retire, and, as our readers may rememiber, was unexpectedly replaced by MLiss Vincing, who bappened to form one of the audience. It was a luciy chance for the young aspirant; and it is only JUst to mention what has since become known in musical circles-viu., that Miss Vinning, who came forward at a moment's notice, thus amply prepared for the execution of so dOicult a task, was in a great measore indebted for her pre4iciency to tho instructions of Mr. Frank Mori (son of theIla celebrated violinist, and one of our ablest vocal teachers),tumder whose superintendence she has of late pursued her -stadies. Miss Vinning was set down in the programme for three pieces, among which were the simple balKad of " Home, sweet home," which she sang with great feeling, and a brilliant ralse composed by Signor Schira-an evident imitation of that one particular bravura attributed to Signor Venzano, which was first brought into vogue 'by Herr Strauss at Vienna, and then by Madame Gassier in London. After the baUad, which pleased the audience very greatly, Miss Vinning was recaUed; but she bowed, instead of repeating it.
Among the instrumental features were a " descriptive" overture by Herr Schindelmeisser, entitled Ont the Water by Moonlight, and the wedding miarch from Herr Wagner's Lohengin-the former rather clever, the latter extremely noisy. There was also the adagio (in E flat) from Beethoven's fourth symphony, remarkably well played; and the Saltarello from Mendelssohn's in A major, which was taken at anything but the presto movement indicated by the composer. How much more sensible would it have been (and how much more mu,siCa) to give one entire symphony, carefully rehearsed, than so many fragments ! We confess that the plan of these concerts (at least of those we have attended) does not satisfy us from an artistic point of view, The band, though by no means perfect, has the elements of efficiency, and if repeatedly disciplined in the works of the great masters might be made a worthy accessory to the higher objects which the managers of the Crystal Palace have (or should have) in view. The symphonies of Beethoven and Mendelssohn are happily not in the mutilated condition of the Elgin marble;, and yet it would be almost as reasonable (in a palace dedicated to art) to offer one of the legs of an Apollo for contemplation as one of the movements of a symphony, when both exist in a state of completeness. However anxious to unravel the mysteries of the Crystal Palace, we doubt if there were many on Saturday able to construct, mentaUy, whole symphonies out of the fragments of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. Naturalists, it is true, from antediluvian relies, m ay, by a certain process of analogy, build up such monstrous specimnensof amphibious animnal life as encounter the gaze of the visitor on his appreach to the terminus at Sydenham, hut these are rather works of reason than of imagination.

Extraordinary Delusion.
EXTRAORDIATARY DELUSION.
The following article appeared in the Morning HTIcraWl of Saturday:-
" A Cabinet Council was held again yesterday. The object was to discuss the reconstruction of the Cabinet.
" Tha noble Lord yesterday indicated in our columns wiU have nothing to do with the Governmcnt at present. He will have nothing to do with a ' Coalition' in the sense we explained it on Thursday.
"There is a hitch! Our contemporary the Mirosning Post is desired to be facetiotus, to be Cupid-like, and dandle with the subject. WiU he deny on authority the amorous mectings we have mentioned have taken place between Lord Aberdeen and the Premier? Will he explain them?
W WiU any journals, being or affecting to be the organs of any of the parties we have referred to, say that the changes and appointments we have stated were not those contemplated ?
" The hitch may be got rid of at the next Cabinet meeting, but we hope not, the hinge of the hitch being the adhesion of the noble Lord to whom we refer.
A As to the accuracv of our statements in reference to the intended coabtion we have no doubt. We never take our pen in hand without the wvhole drop of truth in it.
"A AU we said when we wrote the facts of Wednesday was correct.
"Who, in a Ministerial position, will deny them if asked in his place in either Ulouse of Parliament ? The equivocation of our uninformed contemporaries may do its work.
"As we have before said, there is a hitcll !
"Before Easter the developement will take place-if, as we repeat to-day, there cannot be a dixty patch put upon the project of reconstruction.Y
The aberration of our venerable contemporary is in some degree explained by the article wlhich follows this annoiuncement, and which we extract with all its eccentricities of type and punctuation:-
"'I TE SWORD OF T!iE LORD A'D OF G5IDEON V' 'A BFD OF HEATIIER OR , THO U7SAXD MARKS !' -Those were the principles enunciat-d by the duellists at Drumcleg who have been immortalised by Sir Walter Scott.
"ight and wrong
M horality and money
Manchester and Canton !
"International law and gross public impurity !
Thus fought Balfour, of Burley-and Bothwell, although the descendant of kings.
"The issue of this conflict, if not known to al our readers, can be bought, with many other political instructions, in its (now) one volume, ' Old Mortality.'
" These remarks apply to the telegraphed news in relation to the Chinese war, which we give in another colamn. The details we wait for."
Really, the old lady's friends should take care of her.

The Fate Of The Franklin Expedition.-
Tl3E FATE OF THE FRA EkLIN EXPEDITION.- A case has for some time been before the Court of Session, Scotland, in which the questions are whether a naval officer who went out with the Franklin expedition is dead: and, if so, when must he be held to have died? The late Adam Fairholme, who died in May, 1853, left his whole property to his nephew, Janmes Walter Fairholine, lieutenant in the Royal navy, who sailed from Northfleet, on board the Erebus, for the North Seas, in May, 1845, and has not since been heard of. G orge Fairholme, another nephew, has instituted an action to have it found, under the destination of a codicil, that he is entitled to the whole of the testator's personal estate, valued at 37,5091. This is opposed by other relatives, whose interests, so far as involved in the lawsuit, depend on whether or not James Walter survives, or survived his father. Proof by commission wvas taken vwith the view of legally establisEig the questions raised in tho case, and among those examined were Dr. Itae, Sir John Richardson, James Hargreave, clief factor in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, Captain Penney, and others. Dr. Rae expresses his belief that those reported to have been seen in the spring 1S50 must have died in the May of that year, and tnese he believed to have been the last survivors of Frank-
n's party. Jrm.es Hargreave thinks that seine of the party might have sr mived a single winter after they had been seeni by the Es 1uimaux in 1850, but certainly not longer. Sir Joln IRichardson says, "That if any of the party reached the country where they svere said to have been secen at the end of the winter of 1849o50, it was im possible for them to survive a sinigle year with anly means they could have at their disposal." Captain Penney romarks:-" I do not thinkthat any of the party could have survived 1852; they must either havo perishled of hunger, or from thel hostile attacks of the natives." The Lord Ordinary (Ilackenzio) has reported the whole circuimstanlces of the case to the Inner House, expressing his own opinion that there is thus strong presumptive evidence that Lieutenant Fairholme perished together with his companions some time prior to the endof 1832, and consequently that he predeceased his uncle, the testator, who died in May, 1853. His Lordship thinks that in these circumstances the pursuer, Georgo Fairholme, is entitled to decree in his favour. but qualified by this condition, that before payment he should grant a bond with sufficient security to warrant the defender against all hazard from any claim to the money decerned for by Lieutenant Fairholme, or others in his right.
THE AFrICtN TwIN MONSTROSry. Two lively, active, intelligent black girls, now about 5!. years old, are united inseparably together dos d dos by the termination of their back-bones. This freak of niature is attracting nmuch attention in Edinburgh, and is certainly one of the most extraordinary living specimens to be n,et with. The childran are rained respectively Christina and Milley Makoi; they are gaily dressed, and converse frankly with their visitors, and sing to them little songs in duct sweotly enough. On the occasion of ocr visit to them the sanuter one, in reply to a question, announced that she is considered the prettier one, but her sister very quickly ilut in the claim of bing the gooder one. Althouglh so closely combined, they have their likes and dislikes, and, like other children, occasionally a bit of a quarrel, which they can carry on by heelkicking, finger-pinching, elbowing, and dunching heads
but they scene upon the whole good-tempered creatires, and soon make amends with a mutual kiss. They are accompanied by their mother lMoniini," who has been lately freed fromn the bondage of slavery, and the proeeeds of exhibition, after paying expenses, are to be applied in rescuing aiso froni the galling yoke the father and the other sisters and brothers, of viomn there are eight. To the medical profession this natural curiosity is more particularly interesting for various reasons. It may be mentioned that some of the viscera are found not to occupy their usual places ; the heart of oile; for instailce, beats in its proper place, while that of the otlier beats in an abnormal position. As to the origin of the lsista, it is mystery of mysteries. It is ssid that everything has a cause, but here the men of science are compelled to acknowledge the deep obscurity in which such a subject is involved; perilaps frights, or accidents, or hardships may have to do with it. In viewing this phenomenon we cannot but rejoice that such a _ase occurs very seldomo, and our thoaghts should ascend in admiration of the wisdom and kindness of the Great A-mi,ghty, who not only regulates the proportions of the sexes, but orders that sich a case as this shall be as Wouderful for its rarity as for ith pecuiliar appearance. We 0on1

Mr. Miall And His Constituents.
MR. MfIALL AND RIS COYSTITUENTS.
(in Friday evening Mr. Miall, MLP., met his constituelata :'t Rochdale according to annual custom. The Mayor (Mr. Jacob Bright) occupied the chair, and in his opening address criticized the foreign policy of the British Government. He then introduced Mr. Mliall to the meeting.
Mr. MSIALL rose and said,-Mr. Ma8yor a*d gentlemen, I can assure you, without the slightest affectation, that I rejoice I have another opportunity of meeting you in this haUl, for the purpose of rendering to you an account of my stewardship. You will remember, and I am not disposed to forget, that previonaly to my election as the representative of Rochdale I pledged myself to meet the electors aud non-electors of the boreugh year after year, and whenever it should appear that my conduct was codemned by a majority-a fair majority-I should leave that post, in order that some better man might occupy it. (Applause.) I come, consequently, in conformity with that pledge. When more than four years ago you put the question as to whether I would represent you I accepted. Yours was the choice, mine was the acceptance of yoar choice, and I can assure you that your choice was not more hearty than was my acceptance of that choice. I may allude to my want of some of thowe qualifications which when they can be possessed in company with others are not to be despised. Wealth is pleasant; rank is not to be condemned; both give considerable influence in the iHouse of Commons; I can pretend to neither. I wish to put before you everything which I think will interest you in regard to my past conduct, as also in regard to my future intenions. If you take any interest in the pro. ceedings of your representative, consult the division lis
upon the great questions for which you care a straw, and if I have been absent call me to account; but on any question of importance I have been present and voted, except when I have thought the question not ready for legislative dii. cussion. I go further. I think that a man standing before his constituency shouldconfess when he has done V,rong. I have to make my confessions. I have committed some mistakes. In relation to the savings-bank question I will confess that I was guilty of an oversight that, perhaps, caused me greater chagrin than to any member of this constituency; I believe it was the Tralee Savings-hank, which was brought forward by Mr. Daniel O-Connell on a certain evening in the House of Commons. I was not present wvhen that discussion cam e on. It came to a division, and my name is not recorded therein. It happened that the question was brought forward on the same night on which I brought forward a question which I think you will call one of importance-namely, the disendowment of all religious bodies in Ireland. (Hisses and applause.) You are premature in expressing your condemnation, because I will go into that point presently - but itso happaned that it depended on my own energy and influence to obtain a night. I had been disappointed, for I had obtained on a formner evening the fixing of a discussion on the subject; but then came the great naval review, and they took the liberty of voting that the House should not sit on that night. On the second night which I had obtained there was to be a Turkish Ambassador's ball, at which the Queen was to be present, and the members of the House were anxious to bask in the beams of sovereignty, and it was supposed that no private member could obtain a night. I had obtained promises which induced me to think that I should be successful. The question did come on for discussion; it went on till after 12, and ifter midnight a minority of votes which surprised me wastheresult. Youmay suppose I was so absorbed by the immediate business before me that I overlooked the fact that the very next question standing on the paper was the question about savings-banks in Ireland. I had had a previous conversation with Mr. O'Connell on the subject, and I understood that he did not eXPeCt that he could do more than make a statement, to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer would probably reply. I was one of the tellers in my own case. I reported the votes and retired into the lobby. I don't think you lost anything by that, for Idon't think it woule. be good policy for you to identify your case with that of the Irish savingsbanks, they having had a Parliamentary inquiry into their case, and you have had none. You stand, therefore, in a better position, and, under aU the circumstances, I thought I might franlly throw myself on the good nature of the people of Xochdale to extend to me that pardon which I need. (Applause.) One other thing I wish to confess. It is with reference to a question in which you are deeply interested. It is the question of national representation. You are aware that Sir Joshua Walmsley intended to bring in a bill to amend the representation of the people. With difficulty he had got a night fixed, and we al anticipated that there would be a serious discussion - it might not havo been the best period for bringing a matter of that kind forward; but, however that was, I intended to be present, and, if necessary, take part in the discussion. I was not aware that Sir Joshua Walmsley thought he could not make a house, because every member who stands first on the list has to exert himself to get members there before 4 o'clock, in order that there may not be a count-out. I consequently did not arrive till three minutes after 4 o'clock, when I found that the House was dismissed. I can only say that this was an accident. Now, gentlemen, let me give you as briefly a sketch of the session. It is a difficult matter, as a painter would say, to paint a blank space, and all I can do is to set before you a beggarly account of empty boxes. We met when negotiations for peace were being carried on, and we were called upon to exhibit our patriotism by abstaining from aU discussion on the matter, and I must say the perfect silence on the subject which was preserved in Parliament during the time that arrangements were being carried forward indicated no little amount of patriotism in the members who were there, every party being careful not to endanger the peace which then seemed probable. You know that the result was the establishment of a peace eomprehending those points which the Western Powers had ostensibly contended or during the war. No sooner was peace signed, and almost before the rejoicings were over, than we got into difficulty with America. I wiU not now discuss that matter, but I lU justify my conduct therein by saying that the main difficulty was attributable to the proceedings of our own Consuls and Minister there with a view to obtain enlistments for the army. Against that Foreign Enlistment Bil I had on a previous occasion voted, because it was impossible to put it into fair operation without endangering our relations with other countries. As to other matters, the greater part of the session went by while we were doing nothing. There were from 30 to 40 public measures passel during the session of Parliament, but I think I could easily name aU those which were of any worth. There was the Iamited Liability Bil. I gave my vote in favour of that bill with the greatest delight, and only regret that it was not accompanied by another for amending the law of partnership, so as to admit of private persons putting their capital into commercial speculations without exposing themselves to ruinous consequences. The Cambndge University Bill passed under review, and, besides these, the County Courts Amendment Bill and the Police Bill were the only other bills which could be said to be of great public importance which w,ere passed during the session. Several good bills were either withdrawn or rejected. In one of these you take great interest-I mean that for doing away with the local dues on ship in * I believe that the merchandise sxhich comes into Ro.hdaie and other towns pays a tax for beautifying the town of Liverpool, and aLo helps to pay the borough-rates of that town, as well as their paving, sewerage, great public hall, and otber expenses necessary to the comfort and convenience of a great shipping iown like LiverpooL These things I consider ought to be paid by the inhabitants, instead of which they are paid by those who have merehandise passing through that port, and you are paying part of this as weUl as paying your own rates for the improvement of your own town. Ministers brought in a biU to do away with tbis, when up rose all the corporations which had property in vested rights, afraid that the touching of these old custonis would lead to trenching on their vested interests, and many town clerks went to London to try to induce the Government to abstain from interference. Lord Palmerston did not appear deeply interested in the matter, though Mr. Lowe was, and he, instead of supporting his own Minister sent the bill to a committee of inquiry, before whom one of your townsmen, Mr. AlexanderLivesey, gave valuable evidence; the result was, that the measare was shelved, but, nevertheless, I expect it is one of those measures which we shall have to pass next session. There was also a bill for allowing Jews to sit in Parliament when elected thereto. That bill was under the conduct of Mr. Milner Gibson, and, though it passed through the Commons, it was rejected by the Honse of Lords. There were otbers to which I need not refer, but there is one class of bills particularly important to you,-I allude to those which are based upon practical centralization. With reference to my own motion, in which I followed in the steps of my predecessor, Mr. Sharman Crawford, I may say that he was the first who had the courage to say that allrelgious bodiesinlreland should be lefttosustaln their own institutions; that all public provision for them sbould be withdrawn, and that all inequalities should cease. I believe that it is pretty well known to you all, that if I have any lprticular prejudices, they run in the ecclesiastical ine, and have laboured to advance this principle-that it is no business of the State to afford to anybody protection in the exercise of his religion, and at the same time to meddle with none. Let all churches be self-supporting and self-governing. Of al places in the world, Ireland was most in need of the application of that principle. Mr. Spooner brought in from time to time a motion for taking away from Mfaynooth CoUege its 30,0001. a-year on the ground that it is displeasing to AlmightyvGod that a
religfon which is not true in itselaccording to their declaration should be sustained by the property of Protestants. Now, gentlemen, I told you at the commencement of my career that I would not single out the weakest body in Ireland. When I make the first application of what I consider a wbolesome principle, I find that it is in the House Commons as it it is in every case
so in this, all parties who enjoy the spoil will fight with one another upon every other question but that of giving up the spoil, and the moment:that spoil is touched, whet er it be of one body or another, they all colesce
and fight for the retention of what they have ot
I voted with Mr. Spooner, and, having doneso, I fe't it incumbent upon me as a matter of fairness to the Roman Catholies of that country that they should be placed in precisely the same position as to the endowinents which were given to their Protestant countrymen, and should be treated precisely on the same grounds, and I therefore proceeded to deal with the endowments given to the Roman Catholics, and contended that thpy ought to stand upon the same level, and ought to be
dealt with according to tho sanie principle. Consequently, I gave notice of my intention to bringforward amotion for the impartial disendowrment of all sects in Ireland, and for the entire secularization of all the funds at
present enjoyed by the Protestant church in that country,
or the withdrawment and cessation of the Maynooth endowment, and likewise for the cessation of the Parliamentary grant called the RcgiZim Don uni, given to the Presbyterias, Relative to the Persian diffioulty MIr. MiaU said,-" lWe are an insular people; why should we be on tinnaily interfering
it.h the business of our neighbours? Look around you for the frit of the Palmerstoniaii policy. We have already
had two warg, two occupations-one unsuccessful from hm-
perfet admfnistration. We have a war with Persia, as I read in the pzppr to-day that our naval armaments have taken possession 9if 3 uhire, We have sent an army
6,C00 at-rog to the north-west of India, to penetrate into the central regions ci Asia, to drive the Persians out of tho town of Herat. rn be bound for it that not 20 persons in this ball WouL.d care to know where Herat is; bot we are at a war that may possibly cost as much money, and very nearly as much bloodshed, as that which is happily now concluded. Nobody knows what it is about, but those who are best informed tell us that it is about a lady. (A. laugh.) It is no matter of laughter, though it does assume most certainly a ludicrous aspect. Another subject is the bombardment of Canton. I can only trace this to the determination of the European to find a quarrel with the Chinese." The bon. member proceeded to condemn at considerable length the policy of the British Government towards the Chinese, and after a reference to Italy, Hungary, and our relations with France, concluded a speech of two hours' duration with some remarks on Lord John RusseU and reform.
Mr. George Ashworth moved, and Mr. John Petrie seconded, a vote of confidence in Mr. Miall, which was unanimously carried.

Sir Robert Peel And The Prince De Ligne.
SIR ROBERT PEEL AND THE PRIVClE DE
LIGiNE.
(From the Press.)
BRUSSELS, J.ve. 21.
On Monday, the 19th, a numerous deputation of the English residents at Brussels, naval, military, and civilian, waited upon the Prince de Ligne at his hotel in the Rne Royale, to declare their reprobation of the personal vulgarities uttered by Sir Robert Peel against the Prince in his disreputable speech at Birmingham. The deputation ex-
ressed a hope that the offence would be judged by him to ce-as it was, in fact -an issolated ebullition of low breeding, highly displeasing to the English of all parties, and which the unanimous censure of the Anglican press bad placed in its true light-as unbecoming a gentleman. A deep regret was also signified that the nobleman selected by the King of the Belgians to be his special ambassador at the coronation of the Queen of England in 138, and lately deputed in the satne capacity to the Emperor of Russia should have met with an insult from an Englishman, utterl
unprovoked, and couched in terms unknown to the language and to the sentiments of honourable men.
the Prince DE LIG\o, in warm terms, acknowledged the compliments paid him by the deputation, and observed :
"Gentlemen, believe me that I am most grateful for this your spontaneous act of courtesy and goodwll ; and I amdeeply sensible of thegenerous kindness tht has prompted you thus to repel the vulgar aggression unwarrantably made upon me by Sir Robert bPeel. I conjure you to be persuaded that I do not suffer the displeasure I may experience at this low-bred indignity to affect for one instant the high respect and sincere regard long and cordially entertained by me for England and the English. The coarse verbiage adopted by Sir Robert Peel to revile me belongs only to a sot (tit-ognc) and a blackguard (gamin), and as such I regard it with proper contempt; but, without seeking that personage, should chance ever place me in unpalatable contact with him, I shall not hesitate to say that his conduct towards me has been that of an underbred good-for-nothing (mal 6ler c, etaurien). And now, gentlemen, on my part, I have to express my sorrow and extreme displeasure that any countrymen of mine, and without my authority, should have used this untoward circumstance as a reason to offer you the incivility of refusing your admistion to the tel noble. Such conduct on their part appertains to that category of social offences which we have had occasion to deplore. I have been greatly pained at such illbred and unworthy conduct. Allow me, gentlemen, to say that ont of this unpleasant occurrence I have, at any rate, derived the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance, and of being able, in returning you my hearty thanks for your considerate attention, publicly to testify my constant and ardent regard for your country, its inhabitants, and its institutions."

London, Brighton, And South Coast Railway.
LONDO.V, BBrGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST
RAILWAY.
TO TIHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir, -Before the end of this month the half-yearly meetIg of the Brighton Railway Company will be held, at ehich a dividend of 6 per cent. for the year will be decared. Nothin can exceed the good mnanement of the xmain line from London to Brighton, and the fruit of that good management is this 6 per cent. dividend. But on the branch lines the case is far different. Rarely does a director vouchsafe to travel on the line to Portsmouth or to Hastings. These branches not being cared for properly, the traffic on them is comparatively small, and the profit accruing on them can barely yield an eighth per cent. of this dividend. With regard to the Hastings line in particular, the trains run at hours so inconvenient to the public, that often the trains run with only one or two passengers. There are three lines of railway from the mc'ropolis to Hastings-two belonging to the South-Eastern Company, cue of which is ni4x Ashford, the other vi4 1onbridge-Fells; the third is rid Lewes, and is
of the Brighton and South Coast Railway. i toree years ago there was a wholsome competition between tbe two companies, each strivinz to serve the interests of the public, and thos to secare the benefits of the traffic to itself. In the Exhibition year, 1851, particularly, trains went to and from Bastings and London in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Since the beginning of 1853 the profits of the two companies to Hastings are divided between them, and the trains drawl along their miserable existence, taking three hours and a-half on the road, with scarcely a passenger in them, owing to the inconvenient hours at which they run.
Lord Palmerston and the Russian I1inister came here during this past autumn, and after tbree weeks' sojourn mere obliged to leave the place, as neither they nor their messengers could manage, under the existing arrangeenents, to get without great inconvenience from Loudon to Hastings. They, among many others (about 700 persons), signed a memorial to the company begging for the revival of the quick trains, and at convenient hours. No heed has hitherto been paid to this memorial.
As many persons are obliged, for their own sakes and for their families' health, to live at the seaside, at a place where the air is less keen than at Brighton, numbers are driven off to Torquay, finding it a place, though far more distant, yet much more accessible than Hastings.
If, through your powerful columns, the notioe of the directors and shareholders could be drawn to the present inefficient working of this Hastings branch, and they were to take steps to improve its management, no doubt the six per cent. dividend might become a seven or even eight per cent. dividend. r am, Sir, your obedient servant.

SOUTHAMPTON, JAN. 24.-The screw steamer
SOtTHErrTOAN, JAN . 24.-The screw steamer Bacchante, Captain Younghusband, arrived in the docks a, noon to-day from Oporto, with a cargo of oxen, 15 cases of specie (nine value 7,4061. sterling, and six value 55,309 oitavas), 10 casks of tallow, 67 chests of oranges, 87 pipes, 29 hogsheads, 103 quarter-casks, and S2 cases of wine. she left Oporto on the 18th inst., having 124 head of cattle on board, of which 72 were obliged to be thrown overboard in the Bay of Biscay and the chops of the Channel, and several more were in a dying state when the vessel arrived here. Fine weather was experienced up to the 20tb, when the ship encountered afearfulgale, veering from W.N.W.to N.N.E. and back again, with a very heavy cross sea running. This continued until the 22d, when it moderated towards night. The steamerlaboured heavily during the gale, produci'g the extraordinary mortality among the cattle above stated. After landing the oxen in the docks, the Bacchapie saUed again about 5 o'clock on Saturday afternoon for London, there to disembark the rest of her freight.
The African mail stearnship Candace, Commander Hawkesley, sailed from Ply mouth on Saturday for Madeira and the West Coast.
IMPROVEMENT IN TniF TnEATMlENT OF CRlrsNA_S. -We feel ourselves called on to notice the rumour, although we do not vouch for its correctness, that the interest excited by the case of the malefactor Holmes, who was released from gaol by Sir George Grey because the poor fellow's health was seriously injured by con6fmement, is likely to lead to considerable improvements in the regulations of the Homeoffice with respect to imprisoned criminals. As we have freely censured this branch of the Government, we are happy to be among the first to announce that the Home Department has at length opened its eyes to the imperfection of its present system, and is engaged in organizing the measures necessary to make it as uniform and complete as possible. In fact, we are informed that Sir George Grey (taking a hint probably from one of our weekly cotemporaries, whose pen is not his only instrument for communicating instruction) has been for some days past in constant communication with the Board of Health and the most eminent medical men in London particularly the grea' authorities upon climate, sea-bathing, and mineral waters, with a view to remedy the glaring sanitary defects of prison discipline in England. Abuses flourish so long in this country before they awaken public attention or idflame public feeling that probably few of our readers have ever reflected on the disgraceful fact that, while aU other classes of the community are in a position to avail themselves of change of air, or change of scene, when their health or spirits require either or both ; or occasionally to try the effects of a spa or salt wa'er bathing the inmates of our gaols andbridewells are systematically precluded from all these advantages, though not less necessary for persons in hemble life than for the highest folk in the land, and as advisable on medical grounds for an unfortunate man who may chance to have made a mistake in moralty as for the most righteous member of the community. It has probably never occurred to one of our readers ont of 100, thab even in summer and autumn, when eve* body else flies from London, the unhappy occupiers of Aillbank and PentonviUe never see a green field or draw a single breath of country air. This offensive and heartless anomaly it will gratify the sentimental portion of our readers to learn that the Home-office proposes to abolish. New prisons will be built at our most celebrated watering and iathing places, where burglars, garotters, highwaymen, and *ther victims of the law, will be removed at the proper seasons, and oftener if necessary, from their present cull and unwholeEome places of detention. Sir George Grey has been satisfied, on the highest professional authority, that by such removals it is perfectly practicable to keep our cantive criminals in the very highest physical condition, anftblat in no otber way is so desirable an object o b effected. When the new system comes into operation the tender Part of the pubEe will no longer be shocked, as now they they are contmnually, by the spectacle of a poor fellow discharged from gaol, after the expiration of his ierm, or upon a ticket of lave, with Iiis bodily strength exhausted, his nerves shattered, and his spirits cast down and broken hv confinement. It is even said that the Homecflice have legal as well as medical opinions before tbem with reference to this interesting question, and that their lawyers are decidedly of opinion that as penal laws must be strictly construed, and injury to the prisoner's health forms no part of his se.Atence under any law or statute, the punishment of imprison .uent cannot legally be carried out without the accompanimeat of the measures now in preparation. This view of the law,wf are assured is especially maintained by the learned Junsirions,'lt who advised the liberation of George holmes.-E,camir,cat

Fire And Explosion Of Gas.
FIRE AND EXPLOSION O0 GAS.
On Saturday night a fire broko out in an antiquated building-one of the many that abound at the east end of Lo, don ; according to the rumours in the neighbourhood it waupwards of 200 years since it was erected; it contained four spacious floors, and was situated at No. 1 A in the )Winories, one part being opposite the extensive premises of Messrs. Moses and Sons, the outfitters aud clothiers, while the other side was flanked by the Butchers'-row, AIdgate High-street, facing the parish church.
The building in which the fire originated was in the occupation of Mr. Funkenstein, a hairdresser and photographic artist, and the upper part was sublet to lodgers. A gentleman named John WiUiam Lucas, with his wife and infant, lived on the premises of Mr. Miers, wholesale clothier of Sl, AIdgate; but owing to the singular formation of the whole clump of buildings his bedroom either extended over the house in which the fire occurred, or was sepaated from it by only a thin wood partition; so that
the escape of this family, independent of those in i the first-named building, seemed impossible, as the i whole of the houses communicated uninterruptedly with buildings of a similar age and character in Butchers'-row. Fortunately, Mr. Fankenstein, his wife and two children, who were on the ground-floor of the premises, and who were quickly aroused, managed to reach the street in safety; the flames at that period were raging furiously in the first-floor, and at the same time were rushing up the staircase, so that the inmates of the upper part of the premises at once found that all the ordinary means of escape were cut off. Mr. Lucas, who was with his wife and child in the next house, managed to get out with his family; which they had no sooner done than their own sleeping apartments ignited.
The Royal Societys fire-escapesfrom AldgVte,Whitechapel, and Bishopsgate stations were on thespot in a short space of time. At several windows were men, women, and children huddled together, sereaming loudly. Conductor M'Camb immediately raised his escape m front of the burning building, where he founda Mm Haunna at the first-floor window crying for assistance. He brought her down in safety. His attention was then directedto the third-floor window, where other persons were crying most piteously for aid. Ascending his escape again, the conductor brought down the two youngest children of a Mr. Fennell, tailor, who occupied that floor of the premism He then brought down two more cbildren, and afterwards returned for the parents, both of whom he brought down through the canvas trough of the escape in safety.
By this time the progress of the flames became so rapid that they had penetrated the roof as Mr. Fennel and his wife quitted the building, and a few seconds' delay must have proved fatal to them. A lodger named Maurice Silas, a foreigner, who was sleeping in one of the back rooms on the third floor, upon opening the door of his apartment was met by such a huge body of sparks and fire that he was unable to quit the place, and as a last resort, to avoid perishing in the flames, he jumped out of an upper window and fell upon a slated roof below, and although not fatallT injured he was so much hurt that it was deemed advisabfe to send him in a cab to the London H wspita where every necessary attention was paid to him and where he at present rernains.
The Aldgate and Whitechapel parish engines were promptlyinattendance, aswell as thoseof the London Brigade from Jeffrey-square, Wellelose-square, and Watling-street stations, under the superintendence of Mr. Braidwood. The West of England engine, with Mr. Connorton, was also early in arnving, followed by several others. A plentiful supply of water was obtained from the mains of the New River Company, and the firemen went vigorously to work under the direction of their superior officers; but so dense was the heated smoke that a great number of poor people living in Golden Fleece-court, adjoining the burning premises, were unable to escape by the entrance in the Minories. The family of Mr. Feaneil, when brought down the escape, had not a single article of wearing apparel on more than they had retired to rest in the over night; and in that condition they were obliged to go through the wet to a neighbour's house in'l'hree Kings-court. Inspector Fosberry, heariny of their distressed condition, sent a constable to Mr. Roberts, the relieving-officer, who promptly attended, and had them put into a cab and removed to the union at Bow.
Owing to the great age and peculiar construction of the different buildings, more especiaUy when the fire traversed the warehouse of Mr. Miers, No. 1, in the Minories, and broke through the roof, it defied for some time the exe-tions of the firemen, but ultimately their labours were crowned with success-not, however, until the spacious premises in which the disaster occurred were destroyed and the whole of the contents consumed.
Yesterday morning an explosion of gas took place in the house belonging to Mlr. J. Welendon, furniture broker, No. 12, Gravel-lane, near the Hope Tavern. The family, it appeared, had retired to rest, and upon the explosion taking place it shook a bedstead and its occupants, but, strange to say, although the furniture in the shop was set on fire and blown into the street, no one received any material injury. So strong was the explosion that the next house, belonging to Mr. Johnson, dealer in fish, was, like the first-named, nearly riddled, the windows were demolished, but those who were in the shop, although lifted from their feet, escaped without personal injury. MIr. and Mrs. KSibhlewvhite, of the Hope Tavern, were much shaken and alarmed. Tho brigade engine from Southwvark.bridge-road attended with Mr. HRenderson, the chief officer, and owing to the exertions of the firemen and neighbours the fire was extinguished. Neither of the sufferers was insured.
