S0U231 ~y~&sINaTON MUSE- - SOTJfltgNSINOTON MUSBUM, On Wednesda3y next thin MUMei, which may be regarded as the exponent of the consideration in which art education is at preseint held by the Government of thin country, will be opened to the genral public. On Saturday last it Was visited by erMajeaty, yesterday morning it wza exhbited to a select few, and another privawte exhibition will take place this evening. The South Klensington Museum is a result of the School of Design, foundedin 1838, and the Great Eheibition of 1851. The School of Design, under the influence of the feeling generated by the Hyde Park Palace, expanded into the p resent Department of Science and Art, under the Committee of Privy Council on Education, and the nucleus of a permnanent museum of arts was formed at Marlboroughiouse. At last the Department of Science and Art has achieved a building in which its schemes for training may be systematically carried out, and its curiosities may be constantly exhibited. Thither are transferred all the ornamental specimens from Marlboroughhouse, the entire couection of the Architectural Museum, together with many articles belonging to the Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851. Thus decorative art and practical science have a permanent home, which, moreover, is nobly adorned by the fine collection of pictures and drawings munificently givenb to the nation by Mr. gSheepahanks. The offices of the department and the training schools are under the same roof as the museum, which, while it will be a source of rational recreation to the general public, wil also, it is hoped, be an important agent in the truction of the students. The buildings are agreeably approached tbrough a large garden, with a carriage-way, and are provided withra refreshment-room and all its appurtenances, after the model of Art Palaces in general, though on a comparatively small scale. Situated at a short distance from Hyde Park Corner, the Muse-im will afford as pleasant a lounge as any of the old exhibitions, but, nevertheless, it is evidently laid out for the accommodation of thoze who are determined to fin'd an occupation for a " good long day." The collection of works belonging to the department of ornamental art first attracts the notice of the spectator, occupying, as it does, the corridor in which he will find himself immediately after his entrance. Only a portion of the entire colection'which numbers upwards of 4,000 objects-is at present exhibited, inasmuch as about a fourth part, including the whole of the acquisitions from the Bernal collection, have been sent to Manchester. Fuie specimens of medianval furniture and of painted glass (ancient and modem) are to be found among these works, in addition to a most extensive series of reproductions, consisting of plaster casts, electrotype copies, engravings, &c. To the larger objects formerly exhibited at MrIrlborough-house a hal in the centre of the buildings is appropriated. Here are copies from the frescoes of the loggie of Raffaelle, the cast from Mlichael Angelo's colossal figure of David, and the Collection of models in wax and clay moulded by the same illustrious artist. The educational department of the museum occupies the centre of a large iron building, which forms a wing of the entire edifice. It comprises specimens of scientific instruments, objects of natural history, models of schoolrooms, casts of classical statues, and a library of 5,000 volumes, all admirably arranged. "'Education" is a wide word, as wil be obvious enough, when we state the official subdivision of the department into " school buildings and fittings, general edulcation, drawing and the fine arts, music, household economy, geography and astronomy, 'naturalhistory, chymistry, physics, mechanics,apparatus for beaching the deaf and dumb, idiots, &c., and phyeical training." To thin oollection, which' probably will be the most popular part of the whole exhibition, the " Commissioners of Patents' Museum" forms a sort of supplement. In this department the history of the steam-engine is: copiousily illustrated. However, the chief attraction in the first in-. stance will doubtless be the Sheepshanks collection'sf pictures, which are plaoed in a gallery above the educational department, and number no less' th2n 234. The works selected by the liberal donor were chiefly in illustration of English domestic life, or represented English scenery; and the authorities of 1the museum refer with something like a feeling of. ccnplacency to the absence of those imposing -wo&sa flihed for the adornment of buildings cia alarge s*cae. 'From the pencil of Mr. Mulready there -are 22 works, produoed in the course of :60 .Vears, and therefore completely showing the progress of the painter through the whdle of his caef r. Five pictures are by Mr. Webster, another sedulous student of juvenile woe and jy,'andallthe episodes of rustic existence. Sixteen woxka are by Sir Edwin Landseer, 23 by Mr. Leslie ((in 'his best d, ys), and the names of Turner, Crerwick, Collins, Callcott, Constable, Redgrave, Roberts, and -Stanfield sparkle in the catalogue. In some'few instances (in the case of Turner, for example) 'empty frames now occupy the places of tho actual pictures, 'but the vacancy will be supplied without delay. Thenucleus of a collection of sculpture has also been formed by 'the assemblage of about E0 works, contributed by 25 artists, among whom are Mess. Bailey, Bell, Fbley, Munro,Calder Marshall, and the late-Sir R. 'Westmacott. By the collection of the architectural nuseum, which 'occupies a large portion of the gallei'y and descends into the lower corridor,a complete dhistory of the medim'vnl architecture of France and England is repEesented by almost mnuberless casts of decorative details. The " tradecollection," which is likewise in the gallery, and is the property of the Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, will not always remain in its present complete state. It is chiefly composed of the'natural products used in the various arts, andof these the animal prodticts are alone to be retained,the others being too fTagmentaryto justify their-retention in a distinct musellm. Specimens, therefore, of nineral and vegetable produce will be distributed arong various astional and provinoial museums which admit of improvement. Another department is the "economic museum," formed by Mr. Twining, and presented by him to the Government. The articles in tlis department are intended to further the knowledge .of "'common things" with a view to the general ameioration of* mankind. Everything bas been done to render the new Museum a source of instruction and amusement to: all classes alike, the exigencies of time being taken intoeonsideration, as well as the exigencies of the, ocket. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, being students' days, the price of admission will be i Gd. ; on the other days of the week admission will befree. Thehourswillextendfroml0to4, but theI Museum will likewise be open on the evenings of, MIonday and Thursday, from 7 to 10. The catalogues required cost Id. each.

RMATUIOgAwl CONFRBENOE. Yeatnrday aftemoon the firt of the thee general Confer. enc6s to ba held with a view of fuUy discussing the Educational question in all its bearings, especially in relatioa to he early age at which the children of the working classes are nmoved from school, was held at Willis's-rooms, under the presidency of hio Royal Highness Prince Albert and a number of distinguished noblemen and gentlemen. Long before the hour fixed for the Prince to take the chair the room wras completely crowded, and the reception accorded to hiis Royal Highness on his arrival was most warm are' flattering. Seated near his Royal Highness, on either side, were Earl GranviUc, the Bishop of Oxford, the Bishop of St. Asaph, Bishop of London, Bishop of Durham, Bishop of Sodor and Man, Bishop of Winchester, Bishop of Man. chesetr, Lord Brougham, Lord Ward, Lord Calthorpe, Sir John Palington, Lord Kinnaird, Mr. Robert Owen, Eev. Canon Mosoley, Major.General Grey, Miss Carpenter, oev. W. Rogers, &o. His ROYAL HiGnNrss, who on his rising was received With prolonged cheering, immediately proceeded to address the meeting as follows :-Gentlemen, we have met to-day in the sacred causo of Education-of National Education. This word, which means no less than the moral and inteL lectucI dovelopment of the rising generation, and, therefore, the national welfare, Is well calculated to engross our minds, and opens a question worthy of a nation's deepwst intereat end snost anxious consideration. Gentlemen, the nation is alive to its importance, and our presence here today gives further evidence (if such evidence were needed) of its anxiety to give it that consideration. (Hear, hear.) Looling to former times, we find that our forefathers, with their wonted piety and paternal care, had established a system of national education, based upon the parish organization and forming part of parish life, which met the wants of their day, and had in it a certain unity and completeness which we may weeU envy at the present moment. But in the progress of time our wants have outstripped that system, and the condition of the country has so completely changed even within these last 50 years that the old parochial division is no longer adequate for the present population. This has increased during that period in England and Wales from, in round numbers, 9,000,000 to 18,000,000, and, where there formerly existed comparatively smaU towns and villages, we now see mighty cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Hull, Leeds, Birmingham, and others, with their hundreds of thousands, springing up almost, as it were, by enchantment, London having increased to nearly two and a-half million of soul, and the factory district of Lancashire alone having aggregated a population of nearly 3,000,000 within a radias of 30 miles ! This change could not escape the watchful eye of a patriotic public; but how to provide the means of satisfying the new wants could not be a matter of easy solution. While zeal for the public good, a fervent religious spirit, and true philanthropy are qulities eminently distinguishing our countrymen, the love of liberty and an aversion from belng controlled by the power of the State in matters nearest to their hearts, are feelings which wiU always most powerfully Influence them in action. Thus the common object has been contemplated from the most different points of view, and pursued often uFon antagonistic principles. Some have sought the aid of Government, others that of the Church to which they belong; some have declared it to be the duty of the State to provide elementary instruction for the people at large, others have seen in State interference a check to the spontaneous exertions of the people themselves, and an interference with self-government; some, again, have advocateda plan of compulsory education based upon local self-government, and others the voluntary system in its widest development. While these have been some of the political subiects of difference, those in the religious field have not been less marked and potent. We find, on the one hand, the wish to see secular and religious instruction separated, and the former recognized as an innate and inherent right, to whicheach member of society has a clain, and which ought not to bo denied to him if he refuses to takee along with It the inculcation of a particular dogma to wihich he objects a nnsound; while we see, on the other hand, the doctrine seserted that no education can be sound WOhich does not rest on religious instruction, and that religions truth is too sared to be modified and tampered witb, even in its minutest deductions, for the sake of procuring a general agreement ((Much oheering.) Gentlemen, if these differences were to have been discussed here to-day I should not have been sble to respond to your invitation to take the chair, as I-should have thought irinconsistent with the position which I occupy and with the duty whioh I owe to the Queen and the country at large. I see those here iefore me who have taken a leading part in these important discusions, and I am happy to meet them upona neutral-ground; happy to find thtat there is a neutral ground upon which their varied talents and abilities can be brought to beer in oommunion upon the common object; and proud and grateful to them that they should have allowed me to preside over them for the purpose of worldng together in the common vinoyard. I feel certain that the greatest bendft must arie to the cause we have aU so much at heart bythe mere free exchange of your thoughts and various experience. You may well be proud, gentlemen, of the results hitherto achioved by your rival efforts, and may pointto the fact that, since the beginning of the century, while the population has doubled itself, the number of schools bothlpublic and private has been multiplied 14 tius. In 1801 there were in England and Wales, of public scheols, 2,876; of privato schools, 487-total, 3,363. In 1851 Ithe year of theoXenaus) there were in England and Wales, of public schools, 15,618; of private schools, 30,524-total, 40,042; giving instruction in aU to 2,144,3781scholars; of whom 1,422,;82 belong to public soSools, and 721,396 tothe private sehools. The rate of progress is further illustrated by statistics which' show that in 1818 the proportion of day scholars tothe population was Iin 17; in 1833, 1iu11; andinlG8l, 1 in 8. These aregreat results, although I hope they may only be received ae instalments of what has yet to be done. But what must be your feelings when you reflect upon the fact, the inquiry into which has brought us together,'that this great boon thus obtained for the mass of the people, and which is freely offered to them, should have been onlypartially accepted, and, upon the whole, so insufficiently applied as to render its usealmost valuelees? (EHear.) We are told that the total population in England and Wales of children between the ages of 3 and 15 being estimated at 4,908&696, only 2,046,848 attend school At all, while 2.861S848 receive no instruction whatever. At the same time an analysis of the scholars with reference to the length of time allowed for their school taition shows that 42 per cent. of them have been at school less than one year, 22 per cent, during one year, 15 per cent. during two years, 9 per cent. during three years, P per cent. dning four years, and 4,per cent. during five years. Therefore, out of the two millions of scholars alluded to more than one million and a-half,remain only two years at schooL I leave it to you to judge what the results of such an education can be. I find further that of these two millions of children attending school only about 600,000 are above the age of nine. Gentlemen, these are startling facts, which render it evident that.no extension of the means of education will be of any avail unless this evil, which lies at the root of the whole question, be removed, and that it is high time that the country should become thoroughly awake to its existnce and prepaed to meet it energetioally. To impress his upon the public mind is the object of our conference. Public opinion is the powerful lever which in these days moves a people forogod and for evil, and to public opinion we must therefore appeal if we would achieve any lasting and beneficial result. You, gentlemen, wiUl richly add to the services which yoa have already rendered to the noble cause if you wiU prepare public opinion by your inquiry into this.etate of things, and by disoussing in your sections the causes of it as well sa the remedies which may lie within our ceach. (Cheers.) This wiU be no easy matter; but even if your labours should not result in the adoption of any immeiiate practical steps, you will have done great good in preparing for them. 1t will probably happen that, in this instance as in most others, the cause which producee the evil wiU be more easily detected than its remedy, and yet a just appreciation of the former must ever be the first and esgsntial condition for the discovery of the latter. You will probably trace the cause of our social condition to a state of ignorance and lethargic in. difference on the subject among the parents generally; but theroot of the evil will, Isuspect, alsobefound to extendinto thatfieldoa nwhichthepoeliticaleconomist exerciseshis activity -I mean the labour market-demand and supply. (Hear.) To dissipate that ignorance and rouse froma that lethagy may be difficult, but with the united and earnest efforts of all wvho are the friends of the working classes it ought, after all, to be only a question of time. What measures can be brought to bear upon the other root of the evil is a more delicate question, and will require the nicest care in handLing, for there you cut into the very quick of the working man's condition. His children are not only his offspring, to be reared for a future independent position, bub they constitute part of his productive power and work with him for the staff of life; the daugl:ters especially are the handmaidB of the house, the assistants of the mother, the nurses of the younger children, the aged, and the sick. To deprive the labouring family of their help would be almost to paralyze its domestic existence. (Cheers.) On the other hand, carefully collected statisticts reveal to us the fact that while about 600,000 children between the ages of 3 and 15 are absent from school, but known to be employed, no less than 2,200,000 are not at school, whose absence cannot be traced to any ascertained employment or other legitimat;e oause. You will have to work, then, upon tbe minds and hearts of the parents, to place before them tlhv iFeIpgable linhtsf whigih they tollict u.p9u logg who ,re entrusted to jneur care iy keoping them from the light of knowledge,tobringhometo their convictionthat itistheir duty to exert themselves for their children's education, bearing in mind at the same time that it is not only their most sacred duty, but alsotheir highest privilege. Unless they work with you, your work, our work, will be vain; but you wiIl not fail,I fed sure, in obtaining their cooperation if you remind them of their duty to their God and Creator. (Cheers.) Our Heavenly Fatner, In his boundless goodness, has made his creatures that they should be happy, and in bis wvidom has fitted hismeans to his ends, giving to all of them different qualities and faculties In using and developing which they fulfil their destiny, and, running their uniform course a¢cording to his prescription, they find that happiness which he has intended for them. Man alone is born into this world with faculties far nobler tban the other creatures, reflecting the image of Him who has willed that there should be beings on earth to know and worship Him, but endowed with the power of self-deter. ruination, having reason given him for his guide. He can develope his faculties, place himself in harmony with his divine prototype, and attain that happiness which is offered to him on earth, to be completed hereafter in entire union with Him through the mercy of Christ. But he can also leave these faculties unimproved, and miss his mission on earth. He will then sink to the level of the lower animal, forfeit happiness, and separato from his God, whom he did not know how to find. (Much cheering.) Gentlemen, I say man has no right to do this, he has no right to throw off the task which is laid upon him for hbis happiness; it is his duty to fulfil his misnion to the utmost of his power. but it is our duty, the duty o. those whom Providence haj removed from this awful struggle and placed beyond this fearful danger, mmfully, unceasingly, and untiringly to aid by advice, assistance, and example, the great bulk of the people, who, without such aid, must almost inevitably succumb to the difficulty of their taske. They will not east from them the aiding hand, and the Almighty wil bless the labours of those who work in his cause. (His Royal Highness concluded amid continued and enthusiastic cheerlug.) The Secretary then read the report, which recapitulated the various points of interest dwelt upon in the speech of the Prince Consort, and stated that since 1839 2,C00,0001. had been expended in the erection of school buildings, thud affording the means of education to more than 50,000 children, while a sum exceeding 1,250,0001. was aunually expended for the support of senools for the children of the working clases. Tord BBOUGHAa next addressed the meeting, and went at length into a history of the efforts which had been made in the cause of educational progress by Mr. W. Allen and Mr. Fox, by the late Duke of Bedford, and the much abused Educational Committee of the House of Commons. In spite of the blame which had been thrown upon the last. named comraittee, he considered that it had effeoted much good. In tho presentstate of affairs he believed that a great deal might be done by enEsting on their side the great employers of labour, and by means of the masters influencing the men to avail themselves more extensively of the means of education for their childrou which were brought 'within their reach. The Bishop of OXFOBD said that, with the blessing ef God, he believed the greatest results would be derived to the cause of education from the exertions of the present confer-nces. The difficulty which they had to overcome was nol to provide schools for children, but children for the schools Theymustfirt discoverthecause of thisevilbeforethey could cffer to administer to its cure. He believed that, over and above the causes for the absence of young children from the schools which had been so well and lucidly exhibited in the speech of his Royal Highness, there was another reason, and thatwas the want offirm authority onthe part of parents, andthewantof a willingobedience on thepart of the children. (Hoar.) He believed that that was one great cause of the evil they lamented, and it was one only to be done away with by awakening the minds of the worlkig classes to the responsibility that laid upon them in this matter. They must exert themselves to show to the vast body of parents that the se of the schools was a positive and c4tsin gain to their ehildren, but for this purpose they must be united among themselves, and the disputes and differences as to the boon to be given cease. If they were not decided as to the gift which they were to bestow, they could not expect the people to beleve in their bare assertion that its value was of countless price. The present conference would do much to heal such divisions among the general promoters of edacation; and but for the unhappy differences that had existed, he believed the strong moral senee of the people of England would of itself have done away with all the needless causes for suspicion. (Hear, hear.) The Rev. Canon Mos ELnY discussed the question of the causes which led the children of working men to be so early removed from Echool. Between the ages of eight and nine years they began to leave, &t the age of 1 most left and at the age of 12 years they would scarcely find any of the working man's family at schooL The average age at which this schoolng terminated was l10 years. It was not poe. dAble to oonnect a child of 10W years old with rhe idea of an educatod being, and it was not posAble to impart to his mind at that tender age all tho information and education which the man would want through life. The cause of this early removal, which so often made of no avail the Godly training and pious fruit imparted to the child, did not arise from the poverty of parents, for he found that in his own rural school where the wages of the labourers about the district averaged los. per week the attendance of children was far greater than in the schools of the neighbouring city of Bristol, where the wages averaged 1. The cause was to be found in the indifference of parents, not from want of affection, but from want of proper appreciation of the value which education would be totheir children in their struggle through life.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Mlr. Lander's eloquent advocacy In favour of tith descendants of Shakspeare would no doubt have met with a ready and cheerful response were it not for the circumstance that the poet's direct lineage has been long extinct. I ex. peted others would have mentioned this, but as no notice haes been taken of Mrt. Lander's communication, and it might appear that there was an apathy on the subject, I venture to trouble you with a few lines briefly stating the facts of the case. At Shakspeare's death in 1616 his family consisted of his wife, his daughter Susannk, married to Dr. Hall, his daunhter Judith, married to Thomas Quiney, and Elizabeth Ha , a granddaught-er, the only child of Susanna Shaikspeare. Tudith Qainey had several children, who were aU dead as ely as the year 1639, leaving no issue, she herself surviving till 1662. The pot's granddaughter, Elizabetlx Hall, was married in 1626 to Thomas Nash, who died in 1647 without issue; and secondly, in 1649, to John Barnard, afterwards Sir John Barnard, of Abington, county of Northampton, by whom she had no family. lady Barnard dlied in 1670, leaving no children, so that -nth her the lineal descent from Shakapeare expired. There may, however, be descendants from the Sbaa;peare family still living, dlerivin their genealogy from Joan, the poet's sister, who marriedvWilliamn Hart of Stratford. Joan' and her sons are kindly mentioned in the poet's will. The pedigree is not complete, and there is only a descent from the secontd son Thomas, to whese Eon Thomas, with a remainder to his brother George, the birth-place and adjoining premiNsesat Stratford were bequeathed by Lady Barnard in 1669. These continued in the possession of the family for upvtards of a century. About 50 years ago the Hart removed to Tewkesbury, where, in 1848, resided Thomas Shakpear Har, th ei~th i desentfrom the sister of the rea drmatst.Onesfany i ap toaidin deception in sch mtter, bu I rmembr tohav traced in his feaure a emakabe smilrit tothse of the bust of I a, Sr, ithsicer repec, yurobedient servant.

A BOLD VmETIrtn.-There is now lying at the foot of Pine-street, East-river, a small yacht, ivth the pretty and historincl nme of Charter Oak. She is sloop rigged, and her lines, judging from the way she sits on the water, are everything that could be desired to insure speed and bearing. The Charter Oak is now tking storos on board, the owner having determined to start for Liverpool in the conrne of next week. This is an under. taking of great daring, as will be perceived from the dimensions of the gallant little sloop, the length of which is only 40ft., and the burden 23 tons. Her canvass consists of mainsail, jib, flying jib, gaff topsail, squaresail and studding. sail-spreading in all 900 yards. The hull is built of white oak timbers and frame, with bacmatack knees; the deck is of white pine and the ceiling yellow pine. She was built, is now owned, and will be sailed bv Mr. Charles R. Webb, a native of Stamford, Connecticut, and a ship. carpenter by profession. He informs us he. is onx 27 years of age, bat he certainly looks much older, for there is an air of experience abont him, much of which has doubtless been acquired during half-a-dozen voyages wross the Atlantic on board the Phcenix, one of Kermit and Carew's line of Liverpool packets. Mr. 0. Webb's crew will consist of the mate, Mr. W. A. Tucker, two seamen, and a cook-five hands in all, including officers. He carries out provisions and water for 90 days, which are safely stowed away in the poop cabin. This apartment is considerably roomy inside, and contains eight berths, a cooking stove, coal bin, cask of water, &c. Mr. Webb feels confident o' reaching Liverpool 'within three weeks, but says he intends doing all he ean to reach his destination in quicker time than the yacht America, He proposes starting about the 1ith of the month, and we therefore advise the citizens of Liverpool to keep a sharp lookout for a little black sloop of 23 tons, with white water-line and deck rail, hbich may be expected off the Iers,ey abgut the 5th of Jaly

THE DESTRUCTION OF G1REYTOWi. TO THE EDlTOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the debate in the House of Commons yesterday lord Palmerston is reported to have said, "I believe the real state of the case was that there was a dispute between two rival American companies, the one patronized by the self-constituted Government of Greytown, and the other by the Government of the United States; and that out of the rivalship and quarrels of the two companies arose the transuction to which the noble lord has adverted." There is a material error in this statement; and, is acting for ourcountrymen who suffered by the destructionof Grey. town, and reddent in the country for many years, both before and after the period' his Lordship alluded to, I must beg to explain and to have your assiace in oorect.. ing it. At the period of these disputes (1853) there was no rival Transit Company, for it was not until last year that one was caused by that unscrupulous adventurer, Walker, having, as quasd President of Nicaragua, seized all the steamers, the barges, the wharf at Virgin-bay, and other property of the sole Transit Company, s a mens of compelling it to pay a sum of about $240,000 he alleged to be dueto the Stae for arrears of tribute; and beciuse a settlement of his claim was not made forthwith he trans. ferred the privilege of transit (without which there could not be any "rival" company), the steamers, and all the other property to a couple of his friends and supporters, one in San Francisco, and the other in New York. It was thus that he brought on himself and his men the dangerous hostility of Vanderbilt, the millionaire (chief proprietor in the original company), who immediately sup. ported the cause of the Costa Ricaus, and seut among them an intrepid and adroit seaman named Spencer, who in a dashing maner surprised and recaptured the whole of the steamers, and was thus the proximate cause of Walker's ruiin. The origin of the dispute between the Transit Company and the town (besides that alluded to by Lord Claud Hamilton-a detrmination on the part of the company to find cause of quarrel, and thus acquire control of the town) was that the companyinsteadof abiding by the terms on which a portion of Pnnta Arenas (400 feet by 200 feet) had been let to them in 1851, at a nominal rent of 6d.-viz., their oomingunder an engagement to vacate the place so soonasitEhouldbe required by the town for purposes I shal mention, sought to make themselves independent, on pretence that the point belonged to Costa Rica, although in 148 the boundary of the Mosquito idngdom had been fixed bY a recommendation (fiat) of Lord Palmerston to the Mfoe. quito authorities to limit the King's claim southward by the Rio Colorado, the southern outlet of the river. In the oourse of two years the company had erected several wooden houses, &o., for their business, and on their demurring to Tacate the ground the municipality offered not only tO give them sufficient ground on the side of the town, but to be at the expense of removing and re-erecting their buUdings, because Punta Arenas (Sandy-point) was required as the only healthy and eligible spot detached from the town for quarantine and hospital establishments, a lighthouse, powder-house, &o. Twoyears subsequently Cholers apPeared on the coat to the southward; it invaded GreYtow, and, there being neither quarantine nor hospital, it spred around ad along the cowst northward, whele an entire png of Indians I had at work pepshed in afewc days, with theexception of thee. It was the skdrmishing kept up by t}e company, and the rough-I may say brutal-conduct of its managers and their adherents, in disputing and endeavonring to break down the authority of the municiPality, nd the gross misrepresentations of the state of matters they published in the American papers that led to and had their climx in that atrocious, cowardly, and utterly unwaranted achievrement, the destruction of Greytown by the United States' corvette Cyane, Captain Hollins, on the ISthef July, 1854 Before closing my communication I would just remark that Lord Palmerston fell into another error in styling the "Government" of Greytow "-self-constituted." It was constituted in 1852 by the concession (octroi was, I remember, the expression made use of by one of the inha_ bitants regarding it) of Lord Palmerston himself, as inti. mated to the inhabitants by Mr. James Greem, the British Consul, at a special meeting convened at his house for that purpose.

TJHE LATE CALAMITY IN SHETLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES. Sir,-The readers of The Times are already apprised of a very melancholy loss of life in the Shetland Isles, on the l-th current, by which 24 poor fishermen have been drowned. As a class the Shetland fishermen are proverbiallv sober end industrious, but miserably poor; and hence this mielancholy circumsxtane has plunged numerous families in the depths of irretrievable penury, unless a huane public be stirred to relieve them. 4wing to the distance of the Sbetland Iles, and the fact that communication between them and Scotland is but weekly, it will be some time before the fuli particul are obtained; but enough is already known to satisfy the public that the calamity is in its results of the saddest character, and that there is an imperative necessity for the hind liberality of the opulent being interposed to save the sorrowing widows, fatherless children, and other de. jendent zebtives from ntter starvation. Should any of the many rich readers of !LYec .Tmca feel inclined to give a mit out of their abundanoe in behalf of these mourners they will be performing an act of the most hunmane character.

M?URDEX OF' A WiVx.-Yesterday, at the sittings of the magitrates at Stratford, Richael Crawley, a labourer, an ill.lookiAg old man, aged 62, was examined on the charge of having murdered his wife, MaryCrawley, also aged 62, by beating in her sklU with a billhook. The unhappy couple lived in Well-street, Stratford. The prisoner was a,jobbiug labourer, and two or three days last week was employel haymakdngon Hackney-marshes. He was of drunken habits, and had before been in custody for illtreating his wife, who wentabout silling small parcels of greengrocery. On Friday nighthe came home afterexpending the wages he had earned duringthe day. OnthefollowingSaturday morning aftar parking of breakfast, he demanded Is. 6d., which he seems to have known his wifo ha4 about her. She refased it, having to parchase her smaU stock of greengrocery. Bie muttered some strong language to her, and a maried daughter,M Wily, who was living in the same bouse vwthem, stated that he vowed " he would do" for her if she did not comply with his wish. The daughter did net think seriously about his threat, as he had oftened threatened her, and left about halfpast 8 for the purpose of baying a few articles. She returned at half-past 9, and on going up to her mother's bedroom found her lying on the floor in a pool of blood. The.old woman's head had been fdghtfaUy battered in in several plces, and a portion of the brain protruded. The daughter immediately gave the alarm, and the neighbours and police came to her aid. The deceased was found to be breating, although quite insensible. The prisoner was nowhero to be found. He had left the house, and the neighbours stated that they saw him leave the place in rather a hurried manner and proceedtowardsTemple-milLs, a direction different from that in which he was apprehended. The deceased's dress showed that she had had a severe struggle, and her pocket containing the Is. 6d. and some duplicates was torn out. On search being made for the weapon which had been used by the prisoner, the daughter found in a cupboard inx the room a heavy iron chopper, the edges of which were covered with blood, with portions of hair adhering to it. Dr. Vallance, surgeon, of Stratford, was promptly in attendance, and on examining the deceased 17 cats were found about her head and body. It was thought that the prisoner had at first struck at her head with the *' billhook" part of the chopper, and having succeeded In rendering her insensible, which would acconnt for no screams being heard by the neighbours, he cut at her inhis frenzy in all directions. She was removed to the union, and lived till the foUowing morning, although quite unconscious. Early yesterday morning police officer 18 K came up with the prisoner in the Ilford road a sbort distance beyond Stratford, and immediately apprehended him. His clothes were wet, and he stated that he had faUen into a ditch. He was conveyed to the West-Ham police sttion, and on being informed by Sergoant Walker, 18 K, of the serious charge against him and cautioned in the usual terms, he replied, dropping his head in a careless manner, " It is abad job; hIave done it, and I was coming to the station to give myself up." He further added that he had taken the ls. 6d. from the deceaed's pocket5 and that he, had burnb the pawnbrokers' duplicates. Dr. Valiance gave evidence of the wounds inflicted on the unfortunate woman, and the biUhook with which the deed was committed was produced, and was besmeared with blood and hair. In answer to the Bench as to whether the prisoner wished to say anything to the charge he made no reply. The magistrates then remanded him to Iford Gaol to a&wait the result of the coroneres iuquest. 1TA UNUED STATBES' S FhIGATR NuGaAA.- LmvrERoor, June 22.-The screw steam frigate Niagara, Captain Hudson, which left Portsmouth on Saturday, after baying had completed the alterations necessary to enable ber to stow ber portion of the Atlantic submarine cable, arrived in thehserseyat 2 o'clock to-day.

Deputy lot, and after- wards by Mr. Sheriff Mechi, until his LIordship. re-- turned from attending a depntationto Lord Palmerston. The Council-chamber was quite filed, and 51 of the Fireescape Brigade walked roundI the room. There were several fire-escapes in Gulldhall-yard, and the mode. o£ using then was exhibited to a large number of spectators, . to whom the process- was made far4iliir by the expertness with which the evolations (so to speak) were performed by. the Brigade. By the report, wbich was read by Mr. Lott, jun. (the secretary), it appeared that 52 fire-escape stations had been maintained by the society during the year; that 390 fires had b-sn attended, and 70. lives saved. Sinoe theformation of the society in 1S43, to the present time 3,282 fires had been attended ; 4,010 lives saved, and 306 rpwardp given.

The following resolution was then moved by Mr. Payne and seconded by the Rev. W. H. Millburne, from the United States, and chaplain to Congres, and carried unanimously:-" That wlere human life has been so often preserved from impending death b. fire, as successfuiy evidenced by the operations of thit institution, it demands first our humble acknowledgment of the Divine blesg that has accompanied the means em.- ployed, and secondly entitles such instrumentality to the support of all classes aording to their station and influ- - ence." Votes of thanks were then passed to the vice-presi. dents and committee and to Mr. Lott, j, the secreta... A sinillar vote of thanks to the Lord Myor was carried" by acclamation; and his.

The petitioners were advised that they had rights end remedies against the shareholders end members of the Date Tipperary Bank which they would lose if the Bill be suffered to pass in its present state. The L<PRD CHANCELLOR said, the prayer was one to which, while -the case of the petitioners wvas pending, their lordships would not, in his opinion, be justified in aoceding. COUNTY ELECTORS. Lord AVELAND moved for a return of the county electors in each county, -division of a county, or riding, in E.alead end Wales, registered for property situated within the limits of any borough, distinguishing the total number registered in each constituency, end also distinguishing the number of county.electors registered for property in each borongh situated withLin the same. The motion was agreed to. The Earl of CL&NCARTY presented a petition from Galway complaining of the bribery which took place at the late general election, and praying that steps might be taken to provide for the free exercise ef the franchise- *also a petition signed by the members of the united churehs of England end Ireland, pray iug their lordehips not to pass the Bill for the Abolii,ion df Einisters hIoney. The Earl of WICKLOW presented a petition to a similar effect. The Earl of BREADALBANE presented a petition from some members of the Free Church of Scotland against the Maynooth grant. Earl FORTESCUE presented a petition from Waterford praying for a revision of the Superannuation Act. Lord COLVILLE presented a petition against the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. TRADE IN OPIUM IN INDIA. The Earl of SHA FM,ESBURY asked the Lord Chancellor whether the question of the legality or illegality of tbis trade had been submitted to the consideration of the law officers of the Crown, in accordance with the promise which had upon a former occasion been made by the Govern3nent? The LORD CHANCELLOR said that, subsequent to the statement which had been made by his noble friend upon the subject in that House a case had been prepared upon which it was proposed that the opinion of the law offlcers of the Crown should be taken. The case thus prepared had been submitted to the authorities at the India-house in order to ascertain whether the facts set forth in it were correctly stated. It had been found upon communication with the President of the Board of Control that the facts were not considered to be so stated, and the document containing the case was at present under revision. The question had, in consequence. been suspended for a short period, but it Was by no ineans the intention of the Government to delay submitting it to the notice of the law officers of the Crown bt3ond the time which must necessarily be occupied in endeavouring to secure a correct representation of the facts. THE MONSTER G1UN. Lord 1',AVENSWORTH said, that during the late war in the Crimea a company 'near Liverpool constructed a gun of great calibre, which, they had presented to the Government upon the understanding that it should be used against the enemy at the earliest possible opportunity. Before, however, that could be done, the war ha pily had come to a close, and he believed that the gun still remained at Shoebusyness. He wished to ask the noble lord the Secretary for War wbether there would be any objection to employ that gun against theenemy with whom the country was now at war in another hemisphere-the Chinese? He had been informed, also, that six gnus of large calibre constracted upon a new principle for loading at the breecha principle which was prohibited by patent-had been purchased in America. The manufacturers in this country considered that those arms might just as well have been cast in this country, and he should be glad if the noble lord would inform him whether the report was correct. Lord PANMURE said, that a gun of great calibre had been presented to the Govermment, as had been stated by the noble lord, but he was not aware that any distinct pledge had been given that it should be used soon against the enemy. It had been intended to so use it, but fortunately the return of peace had prevented that intention being carried into effect. It had not, however, remained in perfect inactivity at Shoeburyness, because a variety of experiments had been made with the view of testin" its effects at various ranges and with various charges. 'With regard to using it against the Chinese, it was thought that theordinary artillery would be suffioient for the purpose of that warfare, and that it would not be desirable to give up a vessel for the purpose of conveying that gun to China. With regard to the other qnestion, the facts were, that an American gentleman had discovered a system for loading guns at the breech, and that system had been referred to the select committee appointeal to inquire into inventions of that character, and was by them very favourably reported upon, and upon that reporb the Government had purchased the six guns referred to by the noble lord. It was quite true that if the inventor had been in England those guns could, with his assistance, have been cast in this country; but they could not be cast without his leave, as the invention was protected by a patent. He was not, however, in this country, and therefore those guns lad been purchased in America, and he beleved that they would prove of considerable service, THE CASE OF MR. DIXON. The Earl of ALBEMARLB, in moving for certain returns connected with the trial of Mr. Dixon for a conspiracy to muider, said that the case of Mr. Dixon involved considerable injustice. Mr. Dixon was a native of Noxfolk, and had earned on the profession of a surgeon in Norwioh for 18 years, and had always borne a high character. In Norwich Ie married a lady named Gardner, the daughter of a Chancery barrister, who had been most carefully brouht up, and possessed considerable personal attractions. In 1850 Mr. Dixon removed to Ireland with his family, and rented a farm in the Queen'scounty. While there hegot into an altercation with a tenantnamed Brophy, who le believed was a convicted thief, and who was always in the habit of suing his landlord for trespass. Mr. Dixon, it appeared, gave Bropby notice to quit, and immediately afterwards Brophy brought a charge against him of conspiracy to murder him. Absurd at the charge might appear, one of the stipendiary magistrates (Mr. Brudenell Franks), ap. peared to have been convinced of the guilt of Lr. Dixon, and to have thought that any means were justifiable to insure his conviction. Mr. Dixon had a son, a child between six and seven years of age, and that child Mr. Franks seized, had him conveyed to the gaol at Mary. borough, and kept in prison 17 days, in order that he might give evidence to hang his own father and mother. On the 9th of March, 1854, Mr. and Mrs. Dixon were tried on the charge of conspiracy to murder Thomas Brophy, and were acquitted, the Chief Baron afterwards express. iDg his opinion that the jury could come to no other conclu. sion. During the triAl Mmr. Dixon was kept us by the excitement, but immediately afterwards she fell a victim to the persecution which she had undergone, and died of a broken heart. Pending this charge the magistrates of Castle Durrow levied a poies-rate, for which Mr. Dixon was charged altogether 1741.1is. 9d. In July, 1854, representations were made to hi8 noble friend the then Lord-Lieute. nant (Earl St. Germans), praying for an inquiry into the conduct of the stipendiary magistrate and for a remission of this tax. These requests were refused, and Ar. Dixon was given to understand that if he had any complaint to make 'against the stiendsiaY magistrate he musb apply to a court of law. fO acourtof law he had recourse, and a Dablin special g him a verdict for 5001. damages against Mr. the kidnapping stipendiary. On the present occasion Mr. Dixon sought for no redress against mr. Franks. Whit he wanted was, that the sum of 1741. 13s. 9d., with which he was unjustly charged under the Crime and Outrage Act, should be refunded to him. This year an application to that effect was made to the Lords Comumissioners of the Treasury, but it was refused vithout any reason being assigned for the refusal. That reason he hoped would now be given by some member of the Government. The noble earl concluded by moving for 'a copy of the memorial of Frederick Beverley Dixon,Esq., of Castlewood-bouse, Durrow, Queen's county, to the LordLieutenant of Ireland, deliveredl to his Excellency on or about the 13th of july 1854, rying for an inquiry into the conduct of David`Brudenell Fralks, Es~ stipendiar mnagistrate, who illegally arreste and imaprisondthe me. morialist's son,a chid of betwon six an aseven years of age. and commnitted other acts; contrar olwi onxo wit theproectio ofth meoriit on law in,, '.n5exi-.t conspiracy to- m-ur-de-r on-eTho'masm ..raph, s curargeO he was acquitted at the spring ase at aryborough in 1854; also copy of the memorial of the aforesaid]?. B. Dixon to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, dated December 6, 856%, praying that the polioe-tax of 174t. 13s. 9d., which had been levied on his property under the Crime and Outrage Act in consequence of the said false oharge, may be refunded- and a3so copy of the answer of the Lords CommiEsioners oi the Treasury thereto, dated January 1, 1857." Earl ST. GERMANS having thanked his noble friend for the fairness and moderation with which he had introduced this subject, and having exRreased his opinion that It was hardly fair to bring such serious-charges against Mr. Franks, who was a magistrate of great experience, inteli- geno, and integrity, and was altogether unprejudiced against E. Dixon, said that he shou1d1 by readingextracts from jertain gapers which he held m his hand, -endeavour to aat:sfy t eir lordships that he had not in this insance mis. used the discretionary power which was claed in *o hands of tho Lord-Lieutenant by the Crime and Otrage Att. The first of 1iese papers centained a resolution adopted by the ismgistrate!, of Castle Durrow, the leutenant of the cowaty, Lori de Vesc,. in the chair, requesting the Government to send fnto that district additional police, the cost of whiefE should be chargea>iDe on the townland of Castlewood. That resolution was gigner. by lord deVesci, byLord Ashbrook, by Mr. Vesey and by thre,.'other magistrates, In the beginning of April (ohowinganrddits,onal policeforcewas sent into that distiot A memorial was pres5213ted by Mr. Dixon against this measure, which was forwardedie ohe hentenant of the county 'Rho in answer to it said that, hav,'ng held a serching i- qusry1 along with sovoralof the ma atrAOes- he had come to theconclusion that an outae9 hadbeencommitted, and that a shot had.ebee rired i at Brophy with the intention of taking awayIis life, and'xho repudiated in the strongest manner Mr. IJJor's clnargo that the magistrates had desired that b polie force mitht be sent down from personal feelings against him. On tho 13th of July Mr. Dixon, with several of his friends, had an iuterview with him, and stated all tl'ei circumstances of the ease, but he felt bound on that ° casion to tel Mr. Dixon that having consulted wi, the lieutenant and the mrgistrates of the county, with the law officers, and with the judge who tried the oase, he could not consistently.comply with his request. Mr. Franks, the roS. dent magistrate, had made several reports to the Irish Governiment desiring that the e-tra poisne 0ree might be oontinued, and he believed that up to The present time neither the local magistrates had recommended, nor had the Govemment contemplated, its withdrawal He trusted that he hid said enough to showv that he had not acted in the atter capriciously nor arboitrarily. If he had to do the thing again he should act in exactly the same manner. The productionl of these paers was ordered on the 20th of -uly, 1854, by the 3Iouse of Comnmons, on the motion of lMr. O'Brien, and were laid on the tablo on the 13th of August in the same year; but, up to the present moment, neither that hon. member nor any other hon. member had moved that they chould be printed. He should neither on. pose nor support the motion of the noble earl, but should leave the matter to be dealt with as their lordships thought fit. The Earl of DONOUGHMORE hoped that the noble earl would withdraw the charge which he had made against the magistrates of the Queen's county. From what he know of them, he was sure that they were the last m6n in the world to act in the manner suggested by the. noble earl. As to Mr. Franks, he had always born the character of an honourable and upright man, and his appointment had given the greatest satihfaction to everybody acquainted with him. Re wished to ask the noble earl who had last spoken whether the damages recovered from Mr. Franks by Mr. Dixon were not paid by the Government? Earl ST. GERMANS replied that, to the best of his recollection, they were paid by the Government. The Earl of EGLINTOUN asked out of what fund the damages were paid? Earl ST. GERMANS was understood to say that they were paid out of the Secret Service Fund. The MIarquis of ;LANRICARDE thought thoy ought to know the grounds on which the GBovernment paid damaTes incurred by a magistrate for violation of the law. lIle hoped the papers applicable to the case would be laid before the HIouse. Earl GRANVILLE said, there was no objection to the production of the papers. The papers were accordingly ordered. STATUTE LAW COMmISSION. The LORD CHANCELLOR said, he had to call the atten. tion of their lordships to a subject very different from that with which they had just been occupied, but one of very great importance. He would conclude the observations he had to make by asking their loxdships to give a first reading to eight Bills, the object of each of which was the consolidation into a single statute of the whole of the law relating to important portions of the criminal law. Those Bils had been prepared by the members of the commission appointed in 185 for the purpose of considering the expediency and possi. bility of consolidating the statute law of this country. This was a subject that had at all times occupied the attention of lawyers. It was approved by Bacon, Coke, and Hale as one that the Legislature ought in some way or other to undertako; but all their recommendations ended in nothing. In 1816 a resolution was passed by their lordships' House in favour of this work being undertaken, and in that resolution the other House of Parliament expressed its entire concur. renee. There, however, the mnatt3r ended. Bat in our day the evil had bscqVne infinitely more pressing, for there were every year added to the statute book from lo1 to 150 Aets, s ) that no lawyer, even the most profound, ever pretended that he was able to make himelf master of all the statutes of the realm. In order to remedy this evil the commission of 185i was appointed. The first point which the commission took into consideration was the different modes by which the ob. ject they had in view might be attained; and finally they came to the conclusion that it wAs better far to attempt to do something than to speculate on what might be the best manner of curing the evil. The difficulties which they had to encounter were enormous. It was suggested that they should at once proceed to syatema. tize and consolidate some portion of tho law. That appeared plausible, and no doubt was the correct mode of framing a code of laws; but then the duty laid on the commission was not to frame a code of laws, but to consolidate the law as it now existed. After various discussions, and having attempted in tho first instance to take up what were called groups of statutes, and made some peogress in that awork, they found that it woule not do, and that the only way to make any impression on the statute-book was to take different subjects and consolidate all the laws relating to each of those subJects. This was not only attended with great difficulty, but with great danger; for it was impossible to be sure that every statute, or part of a statute, relating to a subject could be found and consolidated, and that some would not remain undiscoveredf and, therefore, unconsolidatcd. In order, therefore, to proceed with cer. tainty the commission employed some gentlemen of great information and research to commence a registration of the statutes, beginning with the statutes of the previous year, taking statute by statute and clause by c anse of every statute, from chapter 1 of last session to the end. These gentlemen went to work, marking every enactment and every scti-on, and every previous enactment to which any section eferred, either in the way of repeal or modilication. This implied great labour, but he was satisfiel that if the Statute Law Commission did nothing else but complete this work they'would do something that was extremely valuable, for without such a process it would be impossible to make any progress in the oonsolidation of the law. The commission had the assistance of a very learned member of the bar, Mr. Coulson, and they proceeded to divide the statutes into classes; but he might remind their Jordships that thero was a class of statutes which the public in general had very little to do with exeept in the year in which they were passed-those relating to the army and navy, passed every year, and some relating to the revenue and financial subjects. They next proceeded to divide statutes into classes ranged according to the extent of their operation, those relating ts the united kingdom being placed in one class, those applying to England alone in another, and so on, making in all 13 classes. In that operation they had not proceeded beyond Her Majesty's reign, but of the Actspassed during the lasb 20 years it was found that one-third did not apply to what might properly be called the law of the country, such as the Appropriation Act, and all Acts the forco of which expired after a limited period. Taking out those statutes. the commissioners proceeded to ascertain how many of the remainder applied to the united kingdom. They found that only one-third so applied, and therefore three-fourths of the statutes which had been passed during the 20 years of Her Majesty's reign could form no portion of the statute law book if that book were to consist merely of laws which regulated the conduct of Her Mbac tan Hieges. The commission had not gone further bac than Her Majesty's reign, bnt when the operation was extended it would be found that the numbers of statntes to be excluded would be continually increasmg, and the labour of consolidation be as continually diminishing. It might be said that the examination not having been concludod no consolidation could be made. The commissioners had considered that point, and had come to the conclusion that upon some subjects of a popular nature, of which consolidation would be eminently useful, it would be undesirable to postpone action, merely because some prior enactments might posibly be overlooked. They had therefoze selected a number of sub. jects, and among others the criminal law, bearing in mind the recommendation of a committee of their Tord^hips House in 1854, that the formation of a criminal code should be postponed, but that a consolidation should be effected. Besides the criminal law they selected several other subjects in which they considered consolidation could be made tolerably perfect depending as they did upon recent Statutes, such as the laws relating to bills of exchange, to patents, to ecclesiastical leases, savings.banks, &Oc. n all they had consolidated 65 statutes, besides nine others which were now in the hands of the gentlemen who asssted the comm5ssion. It must boeumderstood that although the comImonemploycedthebestskiled5draughtsmentheycouldifid, lettheyhadnotaskedParlaentto sanction anyBi'swhici nad not been gone through with the utmost care by those members of the commission best qualified to judge of their merits. The Bills relating to the criminal law hadb een gone through by the noble and learned lord at the table (Lord Campbell), by the late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, by a genitleman who w^as of the u^tmostassistance to the commis- iU+nterval bea --- clos of -hly m,,aion,l lurmthilelahl n brvas efore re-introducing them this session it occurred to hin that improvements might be made in them. They had beent framed to include all indictable offenceg, but some offences became indictable after one or two previous summary convictions, and he thought it would he better to alter the shape of the Bils and makes them relate to offences whetber indictable or punishable by some other mode. He (the Lord Chancellor) had gon through the Bills with Mr. Greaves, and he now askestheir lordaipe to read them a first time. They did not include all the subjects embraced in the Bis of last year, some of which he thought could be deferred without much inconvenience, especially criminal procedure, which ought not to be dealt with pending the inquiries now being made by the Government in consequence of an address presented last se6sion to Her Majesty by the House of Commons upon the subjec of the department of criminal ustice. They had also postponed dealing with the subject of treason and offences against the State, which were not of a pressing nature. The eight B is which he now asked the House to read a fisnt time related to larceny, including bur- EIN1, iaucousinjuries to pro grty, forgery, offences re. eoinage, the game laws, which, although relating to a species of larceny, it had been thought best to deal with in a separate B i4 libel, and the laws relation to accessories to offenoes. If he were asked whether those Bills were mere consolidations, he must reply that they were not, as the commissioners had not felt themselves jutfied in overlooking the decision of the House I in 1854, that in any Bills which might be prepared It was desirable that the amendments that had been suggested by the Criminal Law Commisioners, and which had met with univer sal approval, should be embodied. Those alterations, he thought, would lead to no difference i of opinion. Such, then, were the Bills which he proposed &o lay on the table. There were several others qumte ready to e laid befoze Parliament, but he thought it would be more convenient that they should be introduced in the other t.at o H ought to tell their lordshipa " her that in proceed.in g wth their work the comiA.o Gioiers had come to several con.tusions which did not occur to khmin it f0rs, tlZ9re wpro P y P. 9190 44t* ;ae ftg example, which could r O and oght not to be consolidatcl. It would be rid .os pedanty t consolidate Magna Charta, the Ac, QXia Ensto, and other old statues ofthe same cls,whichformed the basis rather than the SpuPer8trT otuee of the statue law. The commissioners had tle':efore come to the cQnelusion that with regard to all. Veatutes of that sort they could do nothing in the-way of consolidation. Thore were also a number of statutes expressed in such curious language and framed in so different a slle from that of moderntunes, that if the commissioners were simply to consolidats them, retaining as much as possible the old language, they would produce a piece of patchwork which it would notbeocreditableoto lay before Par. liament. One of the subjects to which that observation ap: plied was the law relating to landlord and tenant, noon which a Bill had been prepared with singular care and skiU by a gentleman 'whose name he could not recollect at that moment. There had been enactments upon the relations between landlord and tenant from the time of the Plantaga. nets downi to the reign of Qneen Victoria, and the commis. sioners found that to consolidate all these into one statute weuld involve their being entirely rewritten, if it were desired to have the language harmonious throughout. loreover, the language of the greater part of them had reeived a judicial construction, and there was great danger that in modernizing it the commissioners might not be able to adhere to that construction. There were a great number of other statutes which, though compartively modern, had yet been amended by one or two subsequent Acts, but in which the alterations were so few or umi-portant that ib would be a waste of time to consolidate them, either alone or in connexion with the amending statutes. For example, in 1838 was passed an Act regulating the mode of framing, and in some respects of construing, wills; but in consequence of some difficulties which arose in carying it into operation'a few years afterwards an amendimn Bill was in. troduced and carried through Parlhament. «e was not sare whether, in consolidating the law relatng to real proerty, the commissioners had consolidated these two st, ates, or not; bat they certainly came to the conclusion that it would be absurd pedantry to consolidate such modern statutes of that sort as had but few additions made to them, thinking it better that the original statute and the subsequent Act amending it should be taken.together. Sj with respect to the statute abolishing fines and recoveries. Again, there were a number of statutes which could not be repealed, and yet which it would be equally ab'iurd to consoldate. The Wills Act which he had already mentioned afforded a good illustration of his meaning. Before the pasang of tht Act in 1838 there was a law of Charles IL which regulated up to that time, the formalities necessary with respect to wills, That law must still remain in force with segard to all wills made before 1838, but it would be hardly worth while to consolidate it. So with respect to the Tithe Commutation Act, which was fast working itself out, and which it would, therefore, be a weasto of time to consolidate. There were other statutes in the same position, but after all deductions there still remained a very great number of subjects which the commissioners had no difficulty in dealing with, and with which they were determined to proceed until their labours were concluded. He did not think that he could usefully occupy the time of their lordships by stating more in detail the course which the com.- missoners had been pursmng. It had been said that the commissioners had done nothing at alL If it was meant thatthey had introduced no Bills which had become law the statement was perfectly true. They coldnot possnbly have done EO. The 18cuities had been great, but he trusted that they had now found their way to do good service; and if their lordships would render their assistance in laying before the public that which would at all events be a useful specimen of the labours of the commissioners he was in hopes that in the eourse of a few years they might be able to reduce the 40 or 50 volumes of statutes now in existenee to two or three. The noble and learned lord concluded by moving the first reading of his eight Bills Lord BROUGEAM entirely approved the course which had been taken by his noble and learned friend. Great misrepresentations had been made with respect to the Statute Law Commission, and he was glad that his noble and learned friend had described exastly what the commis. sioners had done and how far their labours of consolidation had proceeded. He was not prepared at that moment to go into the several subjects which had been broached by h s noble and learned friend, but he could not help remarkirg that the consolidation of the statute law apart from tie consolidation of the common law was open to serious obsection, There were many important parts of the law und. r its different heads which were not contained in the stattew, and to tell the people that they had to obey the latter oniy was merely to mislead-and deceive them. The statemeLt of the noble and learned lord as to the value of the servio s of the commissioners was by no means exaggerated, and .f he were aslked to mention one or two of the commissionea s who were more especially entitled to the thanks of tie country he would mention the names of Mr. BeUenden Ker, Mr. Coulson, and Sir Fitzroy Kelly. (Hear, hear.) Lord CAMPBELL said he had no hesitation in ooneurrir g with his noble and learned friend in approbation of tle course adopted by the noble lord on the woolsack, and Ia was sure their lordships would willingly give these Bills a first reading. But he hoped the noble and learned loid would bo contented with that during the present session, because it was desirable to see the work of consolidation es a whole, and to detect inaccuracies which, even with the utmost care, might still be discovered. He had nev.r doubted that the whole statute law might be consolidated, but such statutes as that of the reign of Edward IIL with regard to treason ought tobegiven with the ipsissimi8 'erbss in which they were originally enacted. (Hear, hear.) T'e Bills were then read a first time. ROMAN CATHOUaO CHAR=TES. Lord ABINGER, who had even notice to move for rcturns with regard to Roman Catholic charities, disclaimed any disrespect for gentlemen who had been educated in the faith of their forefathers, but expressed his opinion thet the Bill, which stood for second reading to-morrow, would be likely to raise questions similar to those which had recently caused so much tation in Belgium. There would he thought, be little difulty in furnishing the returns for which he was about to move, while he believed that their production would be of the utmost imtportance in order to enable the Government to legislate upon the subject of Roman Catholio charities with advantage. He was strongly the advocate of inquiry previous to legislation being entered upon, and he felt assured that the Government would a t wisely in postponing the Bill which stood upon the notice paper of their lordships' House for second reading until such inquiry had taken place, and until they should be in a position to introduce a measure of a general nature, regula.- ting the acquisition of property held in trust for the use of Roman Catholic charities. It was most desirable, in his opmion, that the acguisition of such property should be fenced round with those precautions and safeguards which would prevent it from being turned to the advantage of insidious and designing persons, and he must contend that if the Bill to which he had Adverted were passed the title to the description of property in question would be confirmed, no matter how contrary the form of its tenure to the provisions of the Statutes of Mortmain. It was a mistake to suppose that the interests of Roman Catholies generally were involved in the matter. The fact was that it was the Roman Catholic priests and the immediate agents of the Pope whom the Bill would benefit, and in support of that view of the case he might state that the evidence which had been given by the most intelligent and respectable witnesseswhohadbeen examined beforethelate Mortmain Committeeweuttoshowthatwhatwasmostdesiableforthebenefit of the Roman Catholic laity was the application of the prineiples of the law of mortmain to personal property. It became, therefore, expedient to consider whether the uses to which any particular property was devoted were in themselves lawful, and how far it was in accordance with a sound policy to sanction its application to the use of monasteries, for instance, which were ilegal institutions. To establish the pminciple that Roman Catholies might accumulate property for charitable Purposes to any extent would be to tae the best means of promoting the spread of the Roman Catholic religion in this country, and would be to walk in the path which had been trodden by Austria, by Italy, and by Spain, with 'what results he need not recaUl to the attention of the House. Their lordships might depend upon it that if they were to bring about anything like equalitt between the power of the Roman Catholics founded upon the possession of property and that of the established church, they would be preparing the way for the outbreak of civil dissension, and it was therefore that he felt called upon to urge upon the House the necessity of proceeding in the matter with the utmost caution The noble lord coneludedhby moving for " a remtrn of property in lands, mortgages, houses, and Government securities held in trust or otherwise affected to the use of Roman Catholicecharities in Great Britain, describing the locality and extent of such landed property, and the amount and nature of the seeurities, the names of the trustees, and the particular uses to which such property is applicable." The LORD CHANCELLOR said, that the noble lord was premature in malking the present motion. At present the Chrit7 Commissioners had no jurisdfiction over Roman Catholic charities, and therefore it would be imnpossible to procure the return moved for by the noble lord. The Roman Catholic Charities Bill would shortly be brought under the consideration of their lordships, and if thatBill passed into law, the returns moved for by the noble lord might be procred in future, but at present it was impossible to procure them. After some further conversation the motion was withdrawn. MINISTERS MONEY. On the order of the day for going into committee on this Bill being read, The Earl of CLANCARTY said, that ho was aware that the general practice in their lordships' Hlouse was to consider that the prlnciple of a Bill had been adopted when it passed through the second reading, but there were certain circumstances connected with the division upon the second reading of the Bill before their lordsbips to which he felt it to be his duty to caU attention. The majority against the Bill oE the peers present was six, the numbers being Content, 65. Non-Content, 7, and a large number of peers, it was said about 94, had, after hearing the discussion left the House withoUt voting, so that the whole number oi peers aesembled for the purpose of deciding whether their lordships should recommend a particular course of action to the Crown amounted to 230, and that being the case a majority of 6 had pronounced against the Bill-that majority was converted into a minority by calling proxies. Now he didnot undervalue the privilege of being awlloed to vote by proxy, but he thought that great discretion should be exercised in using that privilege, and that it ought not to be employed so much for purposes of enacting new laws as for the pur. pose of Impeding legillation, which the experience of noble lords who gave their proxies led them to believe would be prejudicial to the public interest. This *as the great council to advise the Crown, but that advice must e iven by those who were present, not by thosewho were absent; more especially in the case of a measure such as this, the effect of which was the spoliation of the church. If the noble lords who voted by proxy in favour of the Bill had been present, he had no doubt that they wouldhave been convinced by the arguments of his nobe friend (Earl Derby), and, instead of reversing, would have swelled the majority against the measure. Under these c rcumstances, he o f et hit to bbe his duty to move that the c o m e E a rl o f thE RBill -sho uld ib e ndef e r se un thao d ay six The Earl of DFRBY..-.Ther is no person who feels more 0#qonply than I do j1W dgnwxito gf Qwj Bill, or whp mlore object4s to the principle, or ratner to the want of principle by 'which it is characterized, bat I think my noble fAend on consideration wDIl see that the present state of the Houso would render his motion, t say the least, injudicious. (Hear, hear.) I must also confess that I cannot altogether coincide in the arguments which hive been ueed by my noble friend, because they would go to say either that the system of voting by proxy should be abandoned, or-what my noble friend seemed rather to point at-thatproxiesmightbegiven on one side but not on the other. (A. laugh.) Had that been so we should the other night have had a most satisfac. tory majority, and might have had no scruples of conscience at availing ourselves of that addition. IHowever we have the comfort of knowing, and that to me is very satisfactory, that of the peors present, and who heard the debate, there was a majority against the Bill At the same time, I cannot flatter myself that listening to the argaments would havo had any influeneo upon the minds of those who voted by proxy in its favour. That is a general principle and, while my noble friend has been speaking, I have been confirmed in my fears that such would not have been the case by looking over the list of peers whose proxies were gvon. Lhooldg through them generally, a set of peera less lely to be convineedaI never saw. (Laughter ) To speak seriously on this matter, however, I cannot help feeling that the difieculty of enforcing the existing law would be materially increased by the fact of a Bill for its repeal having received the sanction, nob only of the otber House of Parliament, but also of a small majority of this House; and, so far as I am myself concerned, it is not my wish to take any psrtinoppsing the further progress of this Bill. I adhere eobjections whichlexpressed the other evening, end I canuot help pressing on the reconsideration of Her Ma3esty's Governmuent the very dangerous precedent which ls involved in this BilU. For what does it do? By this Bill a tax on the one hand and a right to receipt on the other which have sabsisted for 200 yeals, and whichwere confrmei by a Parh3amentary sanction only three years ago, are to be abolished, simply for the feason that the parties upon whom three years ago Parliament imposed the duty of colledting the tax tell the Government to its face that they intend to violate the law. I cannot conceive any proceeding on the part of the Government more dangerous to al rights of property (hear, hear), more ealculated to shake all confdence in Parliamentary titles, or more likely to remove the idea that Parliament will adhere to what it has' done and sanctioned. For some time pastthere have been manyand anxious discussionsupon the grant to Naynooth, and u On what 2round has that been mainly defended ? That, whatever may be the merits of the case, there is an implied contract on the part of Par. liament; that there has been a Parliamentary grant which ought not lightly to be tampered with. That grant goes back for a period of only 12 years since it was placed on the Consolidated Fund, for only 50years from the time when it was first uLade, and I shoula like to know how it is to be supported in the faeo of this Bil which abolishes Ministers Money, although it has enduredfor200years. (Hear.) Inthis case, too, you propose notonlyto doaway with taxation, but also to exempt all persons from the payment of arrears due within the last three years. I know that the members of the Government will here meet me with the argument of ediency. They will say that these arrears form but a trillig sum, for the eollection of whieh it is not worth while to keep up all the excitement and irritation and to expose the Government to all the difficulties which now exist. I admit that. But see what you do. You say not only that in consequence of some persons having expressed their intention to violate the law shey shall be freed from their obligations, but that persons who have violated the law shaU have the benefit of their past violation (hear, hear), while those who have obeyed the law shall be placed in a worse position than those who have disobeyed it. Conddering all these circumstances, I will ask Her Majesty'a Government on which side the principlo of expediency hes ? (Hear, hear.) I feel all the objections to this measure which I endeavoured to sZte-unsuccessfully I admit-the other evening. I think that the grievance of the tax has been altogether done away with by the Act of 1851, more especially by the provisions in that Act which enable the owners of property to redeem this tax at not more than 14 years' purchase. I must sy that I deeply lament, not so much *mary considerations as upon the ground of principle, the course which Her Majests Government have-I believe reluctantly and unwillingly, and in the teeth of their former declarations with regard to this tax-pursued. at the same time I admit that they have carried the second reading of this Bil. If they think fit to persevere with it, as I suppose they will, upon them musf rest the responsibility. £izberavi anemam team. The division the other evening will serve as a solemn protest, on the ground of principle, of the majority of those present, and of a considerable minorty of the peers of England. (Hoar, The Earl of CLANCARTY said] that he would withdraw his motion against the committee; but if the Government persisted with the Bil, he should on the motion for the third reading move that it be deferred until that day six months. Earl GRANVILLE.-The noble earl opposite has dealt so satisfactorily with the arguments of the noble earl who first addressed your lordships on this Bil that I shall not add a word in reference to the points on which he touched. Neither am I going to make another speech on the principle of the Bil; but I must say thAt the course which the noble earl opposite proposes totakein rference to this BiU is both judicious and consistent. It is judicious, because ashe very justly pointed out, the difficulties which stand in the way of the enforcement of the law would be very greatly increased by the majority which sanctioned the secoud reading of the Bill the other evening; and it is quite consistent that the noble earl should stil retain all his objections to the principle of the Bill, although ho does not intend to offer any opposition to its further progress. With regard to the analogy which the noble earl drew between the abolition of ministers money and the withdrawal of the Maynooth grant I draw a great distinction between the two cases, for in this case we have provided for the maintenance of the ministers who have hitherto been in receipt of this fund. [Lord Redesdale.-" Yes, out of their own pockets."] The prndple on which we have acted, and which I believe to bV a sound princple, is that it will be greatly to the interests of the church of Ireland to give up, for the sake of peace and goodwill, a small portion of Its revenues, which we see now canreadlly be made up by a little economy. (" No, no I") We thought it would be for the interest oE the church of Ireland to remove the only open sore which is now left, and it in upon this princple and this principle alone, that I have ventured to advocate this BilL The Earl of WICKLOW, who had a notice on the par to move that the Ecclesastical Commissioners shoud be heard by counsel at the bar, said that after the course taken by Her Majesty's Government in this House in reference to this part of the spebject, h should only bring forward his motionprno formf ; but he wished, in justice to the petitioners, to point out how the position in which they were now placed differed from that in which thev were placed whentheirpetition was drawn up. When this 3ill wasbeFore the late House of Commons at the commnencement of the present year, the commissioners saw in 7he Times newspaper that the zight hon. gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland had made a statement in that House in regard to their revenues and tho surplus then in their hands which they conceived to be totay, at variance with the truth. They immediately waited on the Lord Lieutenant, with the Archbishop of Dublin at their head, and laid before him a true and exact statement of their revenue, showing that that which had been pat down by the Irish Secretary as revenue was not revenue at all. To their astonishment, however, the statement was repeated by the same right hon. gentleman in the presentParliament, and with an additinal exaggeration. Their only resource, then, was to apply to their lordships to be allowed to contradict this incorrect statement anu to lay before them the true state of the case. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the large majority by which this Bill had been affirmed m the other House had been greatly influenced by these very false statements; and he himself, opposed as he was to the jprinciple of the Bill, if it could bo made clear that the comrnssioners had sch a surplus in their hands would not have voted against the BilL But Her M^jesty's Ministers in this House had taken a very different course, for they had acknowledged fairly and openly that there was no surplus. The Church Temporalities Act had always been considered in Ireland as a final settlement of the affairs of the Irish church. It was well known that the funds applicable to the various purposes pointed out in that Act were not at that time in the hands of the commissioners. It was a work of time to realize them, and, now that the commissioners were just plaoed in a position to.carry out the intentions of the Church Temporalities Act, ?arliament stepped in, snatched these funds out of their hands, and determined to apply them for the benefit of a certain number of the 1Ol householders in a few of the towns in Ireland. (Hear, hear.) Looking at all these cir. cumstances, an at the guarter from which the Bill pro- ceedeo, aoe was very much surprised that the Governu ent had taken charge of it. Equally surprised was he at the manner in which the noble earl opposite (Derby) had abandoned his opposition to tho BilL The Archbishop of Dublin-generally a supporter of the Govern ment-was strenuously opposed to the Bil. His grace expressed it as his opinion that the Bill would commit a cruel injustice by robbing the church for the benefit of a few householders, and he trusted that at any rate the House of Lords woulca not refuse the commissioners a hearing or insist upon legislating inthe dark, These were the views of the Archbishop of Dublin, and he had felt it to be his duty to lay them before their lordships. This was simplyalandlords question; for the owners of property and not the occupiers of houses would be benefited byethe BilL (Hear, hear.) He would nowv move pro formd that the ecclesiastical commissioners be heard at the bar against the furtherprogressof this Bil. The Dukeof ARGYLL said, though the Government might feel safe as to the further progress of this Bill, he was not satisfied with mere sucoess, but wished to see it admitted that there was nothing unjust in the principle of the measure. In the discusion the other night the q.uestion raised by almost every noble lord who spoke, with the exception of the noble earl opposite (the Earl of Donoughmore) was whether there was or was not a surplus in the hands of the commissioners- and it was said that a discrepancy on this point existed etweoen the statements of the Government in tbat and the other House of Parliament. Now, if their lordehips looked at the statutory interpretation of the word "surplus" he thought the difficulty which had been rased on this point would be greatly removed. By the 77th clause of the Church Temporalities Act, the surplus was declared to be that which remained after certain purposes and liabilities laid down In the Act had been provided for. The clause stated that " when and as soon asin any one year the said commissioners shall have any surplus after due provision has been made for the several purposes hereinbeforo mentioned," &o. The argument the other evening was that the augmentation of small livings was one of the purposes for which provision was to be made by the commissioners, and it was said this Bill would interfere with tsAt duty. Butl the augmiettation of smaU livings wan not mentioned lntheActtilithe 93d dlausand therefore was not one of the things that came under the mneuningof the phrase "hereinbeforo mentioned" in the 77th claus. It' cntdhot be dotubbd that if the towns affected by this tax were polled the result would be a -complete oondtmea. tion of the impost. It hadbeen objected tS t no substitLte ewas provided, but it should bo remembered that the only substitute proposed for vestry ce when it was abolished was a tax upon the inoomweof the clergy. The coure adopted by the Ecclesiastical Comirsesoners wa to meet at a oertain period, when, after estimating the probLble amount of the income for tho ensuing year, and the amount of their fiTed charges, they struck a balance which was to be approprsiated to the reir of churches and other purposes. The only effect of this, if passed, wtold be to place i1,0eot. a-year upon the a ixed ehargep nd ferve the commissioners 2,0001 eses to dispoe of in other toaytx The tax ywas one which was felt to be oppressive by the Catholics of Ireand, and it was in the real iterest of the Protestant church tha the Government had proposed its abolition. The Bishop of KILMORE3 denied that there wrasay snmilarty betaeen vestry cess and ministers money. The abolition of t te vestry cess by the Church Temporiiities Act dipvd not tak awyanyg Jprtoperty frohmthe church but only. have been practically abolished writhout any act of Parliament had the vestries ohseen to have refused to make any assessment. Mtinisters' money, hoeveer, was actual property conferred upon the church by Act of Parlitment and sanctioned by an existence of nearly two cen'tuies. As to the funds of the EclesiasticalCommissioners, whience the deficit was to be supplied, h e begged to remuarkc that at present their income was only 99,0001., while their expediture was 97,000I;leavingasrlLro ol.%D to be pprop orth avifna aurpluv of only. 2,0001. to pprpritedforthebuilding fund and for the aug. mentation of small livings towards which object they hadas yet been able to do nothing. He hoped the Government would remember that tberewere 302 livings in Ireland below 1001. a-year. He did not wanit money from the Governmnent, but there were two ways in which the funds at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners might be increased. They might be increased by more eoonomical management on the p art of the oommissioner themselves, and they mitght also be increased by improving the-property n. the hands of those functionaries. the Governmenet might render effecteive assistance in promotng the latter LordDONOUGHMORE denied that ministers' money was analogous to vestry cees, and referred to an Act passed in the present reign empowering the Ecclesiastical Comumissioners to apply teir funds to the augmentation of small lvings. The oman- Catholic priest in Ireland wero determined to agitate against the very existence of the Pso. testant establishment, and he had no hope that the present Bill would induce them to give up that determination. There was an evident inclination on the part of the Government to wield to priestly dictation, and he was afraid they col =o edepended upna to protect the main revenues of the cburch. The Act of 1833 was founded upon broad and liberal principles, fair to all parties, whereas the present measure was a simple transerence of the property of the church to the pockets of the houselbolders of certain towns in Ireland. He st felt the objections which he expressed upon the second reading; but as the second reading was carried by a majority he would leave with the Government the responsibility of passing the BilL The Marquis of WESTME&ITH said, tho Government 'were mistaken if thev supposed that concession would giva relgious peace to Ireland. As long as there was a single Protestant in that country the Roman Catholics would agitate religious questions, and when they could strike they would strike if they dared. Viscount DUNGANNON was at a loss to know why all opposition had been withdrawn. Of all dangerous precodent3 which had ever been estblished this was the most mischievous. Of all unjust measures which had ever been passed by Parliament this was the 3nost glaiing and of all acts of spoliation which had ever been committed by a legis. lative assembly this was the most flgrant. The motion of the Earl of WICKLOW was negatived without a divison. The House then went into committee on the BiU. The Earl of ELLEZEBOROUGH said he had given the Government an opportunity of adopting some amendments but they did not seem disposec to act upon his suggestion. Earl GRANVILLE said the Government would consider the amendments, bht they did not properly belong to this mneasure. The Earl of WICKLOW thought the Government should postpone the BDiU until the suggestions of the noble earl had Earl GRANVILLE was of opinion that no advantage could result from the postponement of the Bill. The Government were prepared to give due consideration to the amendments which had been suggested, and he felt assmred th%t in adopting that course theywould have the full co-operation of the Eccledastical Commissioners themselves. The Bishop of 1KILMORE said that he should be sorry that the plSSIng of the Bill should lead to an agitation upon the part oi the clergy of the established church against the MWayncotb grant,by way of renrisal for the abolition of mninisters money. The adoption of such a course would, in his opinion, be unworthy of their sacred calling. Lord DUNGANNON renewled his protest against the measure, as calculated to perpetrate a flagrant injus. tice. After a few remarks fromthe Earl of DoxouGMonE and the Earl of ELi,stBoRouGu, the BiU passed through commnittee.

THE ROCHDALE ELECTION PETITION. Colonel FRENCH rose to put a question to the Speakerconnected with the privileges of the Hose. He had alwaysunderstood that a committee of that House did not possesa any power which the House itself had not; and he believe I it would be generally admitted that no member could be ex. eluded from the debates unless there was some questioa under discussion personally affecting himself, while, even, then, a member was permitted to make a statement before. he retired. A seleet committee wasappointed late last week to inquire into certain proceedlugsOeonnected with the peti. tion against the return for the borough of Rochdale. There& were two forms in whic, a committee could be appointedviz., either as a select committee (as in this-instance) or as a. secret committee. If the House thought it advisable that an inquiry should be conducted in secret it had the. power so to order, and it had frequently done. Durbin the last 40 wears there had been some 12 cses. of the House directing inquiries to be carried on in secret. Now, the select committee appointed to inquire into tha circumstances connected with the Rochdale election petition. without any knowledge different from that which the Housa. possessed when it appointed them-because they had not. then taken any evidence--had thought fit to convert them. selves into a secret committee. A great number of lawyers sat on that committee, and therefore they had skilfully. avoided committing themselves. They did not issue ia. otder that no member should be admitted, but ttly wozdecI. thelr notification in a pemlir way, to the effect that it war. the opinion of the committee that the public service woul!. be promoted by the members present being confined to thosewho had been selected to serve on the committee. In common with other hon. members he had been rather anxious to witness the proceedings, and knowing that the com. mittee. had no right to exclude himi he went tothe committee-room. He had been received with great courtesy by the members of the committee. It was per. fectly competent for hinm to zemain, notwithstanding the unanimous opinion of the committee; and if they really believed, as he supposed they did, that the presence of any member would have injured the public service, or prejudiced the inquiry.-he thought they had but onecourse to pursue-viz., to adjourn till that (Monday) evening, and then apply to the HouEe for further instractions. Under the circumstances, hehad deemed it better to. withdraw from the committee-room. But he now took the liberty of asking the Speaker whether a select committeem appointed by that HIouse had power, either directly or indicUly, to constitute themslves a secret tribunal Mr. HENLEY.-Sir, before you auswer that question I hope you will allow me to make a suggestion to the Hou e, as the Committee of Privileges did me the honour to ask ma to preside over its deliberations. That committee was perfectly wel aware of the distinction between a select and a secret committee. Thehon. memberhas sid thathe thinks the committee was of opinion that its character ought to be changed, and that our duty was not to have proceaded withL the inquiry but to have adjourned until the opinion of the, House was asked as to whether it should be a select or a secret committee. It is in the recolltection of those hon. members who were here late on Fridry night, when this committee was appomnted, that the irs thing proposed was that it should not meet till onday; but, in consequence oe a strong opinion expressed by various members of the House, the unusual course wras taken of appointing it to meet on Saturday. Many members were apprehensive that if the committee did not meet forthwith the ends of justicemightbedefeated. Underthesecircumstancesthecom. mitteemeton Saturday. We were, of course, toacertain degrea unaware of the nature of the evidence that might be given. by Rothwell and Lord, who were the witnesses to bp examined on that day. In exercising the discretion which the House intrusted to us we thought we should best carry into effect the view of the House by resolving that no person but a member of the committee should be preentduring the taking of the evidence. We, however, did not. presume to exclude any member of the House. (Hear.) There were, as the hon. gentleman has said, many legal gentlemen on the committee, and I may answer for ther-_ though, generally speaking, it is very unadvisableto attemnpt to answer for such gentlemen (laughter),-that they woula not presume to exclude any member from the room. The view which we took as to wvhat was most conducive to the public service received, I think, a most remarkable confirmation, because aU the members-and there were not a- few-who were not on the committee but who at first. desired to be present, immediately assented to the propriety of our view by abstaining from coming into the room. (A. Laugh.) They, in fact, showed no disposition to come in after they became aware of the opinion of the committee., After the inquiry was terminated on Saturday we saw no, reason why the same course should be pursued on Monday, and therefore the public as wel as hon. members have been admitted. The SPEAKER.-In answering the question put to me by the hon. member as to tho rule of the House upon thissubject, I have to state that cases have of late years oscurred, and that a very distinct ruling upon this matter has beea delivered from this chair by my immediate predecessor. Om the 23d of Febraary, 1849, he stated that, acording to the rules of the House, every hon. member has the privilege oE attending in a committee, unless it be a secret committeeThe usual practice has been that during the deliberations oL the committee other hon. members kave left the room. There have been instances in which hon. members woulct Dot leave the room, and where, on the application of the. committee, the House has granted the power of excluding hon. members. The rule, therefore, has been very distinctly laid down-aud it was assented to by the House-that hon. members 'are privileged to attend in committees. Indee 1, there does not appear to have been any difference oE opinion between hon. members and tho members of the committeeaupon this subject. The hon. member does noe ask me a question as to an exercise of discretion on either side, and I therefore think it fitting to confino myself to aninouncing what is the rnle of the House. (Cheers.) DISTRIBUTION OF THE VICTORIA CROSS. In reply to a question from Colonel FREzxCi as to the.. arangements for the distribution of the Victoria Cross, Sir B. HALL said,-I am directed to state that the ofiect of the Government is to provide as much general a2oom-odation as possible, and not to give more exclusive, accommodation than is absolutely necessary; and I have re- cpived instructions toakearrangementsafollow There, ill be a centre compartment for the Qaeen; there will be, two other compartments,one on the right and the otheron the. left, to accommodate the members of the co8ps diplomat7ique thegreat officers of State, both past and present, and dZtin. gpished naval and mility officers, inclusivo of the relations of those officers who are to receive the decorations fron& Her Majesty. Independent of this there will be wings t3 these compartments, one on the north and the other on the south, affording room for about 7,000or 8,000personsi Thsse persons will be admitted by tickets, which must b3- applied for at the Quartermaster-General's offlce, Ho:sez Gquards, and any peer or member of Parliament desirous oF attending will receive a ticket on masking application on orbefore Wednesday evening. There will be a large space of ground in the park for the publio who do not obtaim lickets. ORDNANCE SURVEY. In reply to Mr. IIDDELL, &r. J. WILSON said that the Ordnance survs of xew. castle, Tynemouth, and Aluwick had bn completed, as well as that of the mineral parts in the south-wvestof the county of Northumberland. The mnaps would have beeo published almost immediately upon a 25-inch sale but for the decision which was arrived at by the Holue the othet night. They would therefore be published ona six-indt scale. He had been informed that the maps would be pub. lished towards the end of the year. The remainder of the. county would be surveyed upon a 6-inch scle. In repl to a question from Sir D. NoninyM, with refer-. ence totne Ordnance survey of the county of Durham, Sir J. RAMSDEN said that county had been drawn on a 25 inch- scale, btt the publication woula be on a six.inch scae, The county of Durham was orderd a7 a Trearx
RESIGNATIONS OP BISHOP& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your report to-day of last uight's converation upon the resignation bf bishops no allusion appears to hAve been imade in it to the fact that four prelates during the last century virtually, if not formally resigned their see and peerages on tranahktion from Engligh to Irish sees prior to the Act of Union,-viz., Bisop Evans, tranlaUted from Bangor to Meath In 1715; Bishop Nicholaon, tranafrted irem Catlisle to Derry in 1718; Arohbishop Bo-lter, translated from Bristol to Armagh in 1724; and Archbishop Stuart, translated from St. David's to Armagh in 1800. In all these caes there was a virtual if not a formal re signation of the English xee and peerage; and I snapect, under a certin Act of 17th Charles IL, a formal Ane. In 1674Archbishop Leighton resigpd his see of Glasjow to ling Charles IL, and in 1609 Archbiahop Donellan resigned his se af Tuam. There ire also six other Css of Irish bishops zesigning their sees betwen 1551 and 1612. When Bishop Carr resigned his se of Bombay he was promoted to the rectory of Bath, which he still holds. The Cathedral Commnissioners have suggested that some cathedral preferment would afford a suitable provision for retiring bishops. If, therefore, the first vacant deanery, or St. lauls or Westminster canonry, were conferred upon Bishon Hinds there would be a pension of at least 1,0001 a- 3ear Cunder the Acst of 3d and 4th of Victoria, chap, 113, te. (6,) all ready at once. There would then be no occason for any Act of Parliament, if it were understood that resig ation o£ a bishlopric conferred a noral clait to the first vacant deanery or London canonr. ram.Sir Yonr Ahedrent servannt c. 11.

ZOZDON, TUTSDAY, J?7Z 23,1857. In the House of Lords last night the LORD fh'oRxhop, with anappropriate explanation, intro. i duced eight i3ills wrhich had 16een prepared by th*. Statute Law Conimissioni for the codificatioii.of tie'. law. .llese related to. lareeny,-including b glary; mvtijclous inljtiries to property, forgery,- ofienoerelating to tbe cohiage, the -game lIAWs, libel, amnd the laws relating to ac=essorie§ to offeneu jbut I severa others were in courm of pr o 4 woould in due time be introdttd Lie del1be thorincipIes by which the commsionersad been gai.e inbir important~ and arduou labour., ad Deisevod that, as the result of thei woro, the 50 volumes of statutes would be ultimatklyxedAWd 0° twro or three. TLord BRon A and Lord aw -j d in the aptrwobtion expressd of the Commisaioz4 nd tieE fthe qThusoz were read a firt time. Lord AINrGxsa then made a miotion foe rehii respocting Roman Catholic Vharities, wiwch lhe withdrew after some converstlo ; and their IU slips went into committe upon the M*inister Money Bill in spite of the opposi6n of Lord CLACARTY, Lord DEaaY contenting hihlf with a protest against the measure, and thro*ing the wiole rsponsibility of it upon the G-ove t Lobrd Wrox.ow moved that the Ecclesiate Commip` xioners of Ireland should be heard by o3fed at thebar but thia motiou ab,o was negatived witout, a division, and, in spite of several protests indmuch expremsed disa probation, the Bidl went ffiough committee, anx their LordAipo then adjourwd. In the House of Common;, Colonel FRmeNTo, referring to the excluuie of members from the proceedings before the cornnide on the petition of Mr. NEwAn, which met qn Saturday, inquired of the SPZ:wR whether:& select committee appointed by that House pe' sessed, either directly or indirectly, such power. I The SPZAxr stated that the rulc had been dCtinctly laid down that unless the ecommittee were a secret one memaber were privilegsd to attend committees. In reply to ingriries made by Colcael FBEnxH and Lord GALWAY, Sir B. HALL explaimed the nature of' the accommnodations that w6uld be made for witnessing the appkoaching ceremonyin Hyde Park. On the order for cemidering the Oath# Billas amended in committee, MIr. S. FizGERAnD moved the addition c three cTauses-the first disablig persons profesin the Jewish religion from holdiug certain offioes; a seoond, incapacitating them' nifpresenting to'benefices in right of office; the third, disqualifying them from advising in the appoi3atent to offices inthe established church. He ha& been informed,. he said, sice he came to the Romse that Him MLjEsn!s Government did not mntend to offer 3y opposeitin to these claues. Lord saL3nmsmns said he hadl thought the oobtingeneits contemplated in the clauses so *nlikely to. happen that it was scarcely worth while to inVer provision agains.t them in any Act of Parliament s. I but, being extremely anxious that the Bill shoulci passe if the admission of the propose clauses vouldli tend in any degree torender more likely the paaage 'of the- Bil}, Hn MAzs's Government wouldW think themnselves deeply responsibl if for slight reasons they opposed them. Not attaching any inportance to the provisions, but considering thea unobjectionable, he sbould not therefLre object to their- adoption. After a short conversation, in wRtieh Sir F.

Education is commonly supposed to suffer two great wrongs at the hands oi soeiety. It neither begins early enough, nor lasts long enough. Ev.wybody who receives a ptupil, whether five year.% old or eighteen, complains that he does not bring with him the requisite stock of learning and skill; and when the head of a College takes leave of thIe most distinguished man of Lis year at the age of 22 he regards his young friend as still on the threshold of science, and having, in fact, to begin his education. For the last fifty years the first of these complaints has made itself most heard and has receivedithe most attention. Schools have been founded,for children and infants stil younger and younger5 till we have come at last to schools rooms with padded floors and walls for a class of pupils who cannot even sit under teir teachers. True, there used to be places where'ery little children were taught-to read after a faak,a ; but an indiscriminate onslaught has been ma* oa " dame schools," and they have been' swaUowed up in the monster " infant school," too often; we believe, only to justify the old cautics against putting too many eggs into one baslet. The complaint which now predominates is that which' expresses the very natural feeiings of 'a master or mistress on parting with pupils, miore or less hopeful, at the very time when they are beginning to seb the fruits of learning. It was the inost pathetic thing that- HoImR could say of a noble youth stretched on the battlefield that he never lived to repay the care of those who had brought him, up.

On this very day one hundred years ago the -magnificent Empire of Britain in the East was founded by the genius and daring of a single man. To that man, after this lapse of years, it is now proposed to erect a monument, and a meeting will this morning be held to put the design in proper train. Our words are not overcharged. Beyond daoubt the valour and abilities of thousands have been expended on the maintenance and extension .)f that dazzling structure of power which has risen -n the Ganges; beyond doubt we owe it to -Thhe utnceasing efforts of our statesmen and soldiers tlhat this wnarTeUous fabric of conquest has been seadily consolidated and enlarged. Our positioa ,mould only have been preserved by the same arti ,which acquired it; but, if ever a mighty revolution emould be attributed to a single man, that man was AROBERT CalVE. In the year 1707 the potentate known as the GRIEAT MOGUL was still enthronel at Delhi, nor Ihad his power been curtailed by any encroachmnents but those of his own vassals. These Vassals, however, were established in independent -novereignties, and of such sovereignties the most splendid was that of Bengal-a pro-vince to this day retaining a supremacy ia,aignity and wealth. The residence of the NABOB, war virtual monarch, of the territory was at Moor-shedabad; it was only in some factories near the tea that a few traders, less secure -than even the 33ritish merchants at Canton, represented the ini2ereats of England. in the proviDne of Madra theBritish power was more asqure#, and developed, though there only through tb* telf-same ageaqes which were soon to estailish it in Bengal. CLIVE had gone out to Madras ae a clerk, had found the enermies of England in the ascendant, and had by a series of military exploits, in which the capture and defence of Arcot stood brilliantly conspicuous, retrieved and exalted the credit of our arms. But India was not tobewoninMacrlas. It was on the Ganges that the great prize was to be gained, and to this famous scene of romance and riches the calamities of his countrymen soon summoned OLIVE. SURATAan DOWLAH, the Nabob-of Bengal, was a youth about 20 years of age, with more than the average follies and vices of Oriental Royalty. Out of caprice, or wantonness, or malice, he marched from his capital with a powerful force against our little settlement at Fort WjUiam, and, finding no CLIVE in the garrison, carried the place and sacked it. This was on the 20th of June, 1 756. In the night which ensued occurred that- dreadful tragedy, even now related with horror, when upwards of 100 Englishmen were smothered in the Black Hole, while the NAnoB was reposing after his conquest. The capture of the settlement and the miseries of the British were communicated with al speed to the superior power then established at Madras, but it was only in the first week of* August that intelligence-now transmissible in a dozen seconds -reached Fort St. George from Fort WiUiam. The alacrity of the authorities, however, could not be surpassed in the present day, for in eight and forty hours it was resolved to despatch a force to the relief of the sufferers, and in December Calcutta witnesse3J the arrival of 1,000 European soldiers, 1,500 Sepoys, and RoBmRT Caxvx. In a few days the Commander had recovered the fort and retrieved our position ; but such a victory was insufficient, and to the mind of CLivE it did not seem extravagant to project the dethronement of a Prince who ruled over 30 millions of subjects an.-; the fairest provinces of Hindostan. With his little force he marched towards Moorshedabad, and then followed that momentous crisis in which the fate of India was to be determined. SURAJA} DOWLAH had advanced from his capital as far as Plassy-a town lying a few miles to the east of the Soorool station on the East Indian Railway. A river separated the two armies, and CLIv;, uncertain of his position, and suspecting tre-achery in those who had promised treason, had to decide whether he would stake the lives of his whole force and the very existence of British power in a battle with an adversary possessing 50 times his strength. The NABOB had 40,000 infantry, not altogether ignorant of European discipline, 15,000 excellent cavalry, composed of the same material from which we raise our own irregulars, and 50 guns of lsrge calibre. CLIvI had a single English Regiment, the 39th, mustering some 900 men, about 100 European Artillerymen, half as many British sailors, and some 2,000 Sepoys. It was a terrible moment, for no man then knew the relative prowess of English and native troops, and it was for CIIVE to make the discovery at the hazard of his all. Never before that time, or after it, was he known to hesitate, but he now called a Council of War, and, -what was stUll more extraordinary, he concurred in the natural resolution of such a meeting not to fight. But after the Council broke up he retired from the tent and communed in solitude with a better adviser-his own daring spirit. The result appeared presently in a decisive order that the army should pass the river. There was nothing but this decision required. The mountain vanished as he approached it. There was no fight, no struggle-scarcely any bloodshed. He had taken the leap in the dark, and he found himself, firm and unassailable, upon his feet. With a loss of 20 men on his own side. and only 500 on the side of his antagonist, he had upset the dominion of the Viceroy and transformed the English from tenants at will of Fort William into governors of BengaL From that hour our whole position in India was changed, and a career of conquest was inaugurated which difficulties and even disasters have occasionally attended, but which no reverse has ever checked. The great Empire of the East was opened to us by the victory of this very day, by the audacity and discernment which led a battalion against a host, which detected the hollowness of a barbaric show, and counted with confidence on the British bayonet. Many have done it since, but CLIVE led the way. Others, like WELL,ESLEY at Assaye, like LARE at Laswarree, and GouGH at Chi]lianwallah, have encountered far more terrible realities, but CLIVE first advanced courageously against a monster on the perilous speculation of finding it a phantom. Hle founded the reDutation of the British arms, and with this reputation the Empire of the East. It was not only that the rich province of Bengal passed into our hands, and gave us at once territorial dignity and monarchical power, but the example had been set and the path marked out. CLIvE has had many noble successors, but the honour due to a founder is his alone. And what is that he has founded ? Not only a dominion from which we may import at our pleasure almost all the precious commodities of the world, but an empire in which thousands of Englishmen of every generation can find scope for their enterprise and recompense for their toil. Ships, Colonies, and Commerce have not been of more service to us than this famous land, which does not, it is true, pour forth gold and diamionds, but whicb, by providing for the natural expansion of an adventurous race, effects more than the mines of Peru could accomplish for the progress of the -nation and the l:appiness of the country. We need never look for revenue from India. No tribute that could be paid by one State to another would be half equal in value to such a field of advancement as India supplies, and at this very time, indeed, some of the latest exertions of our legislators have been occupied in stimulating the honourable ambition of youth by a better prospect of those prizes which CLIVE first opened to Britain a century ago. What England then needed in the East was a man who could so far outstrip his con- temporaries as to take a true measure of Englishmen and Asiatics, who could extend his views beyond the horizon of mercantile contentment, who could dare everything before daring had been found safe, and who could realize by the inner vision of genius a conquest so wonderful as to surpass ordinary belief. That man was forthcoming in Ronzr.m COIvE, and all that a nation owes to a founder of empire and a pioneer of glory is due from us to his memory.
The tone of commercial morality in the City of London would appear to be digularly dull, if we are to judge by the report of the proceedings which took place at the Central Criminal Court on Friday and Saturday of last week before Mr. Baron CHANELL. JoHN Ihx MAY, WLiAS TAYLOR, and GEORGE DAVID MYERs were charged with having unlawfully conspired to obtain a large quantity of goods by falso pretences. The persons whose property had been thus misappropriated were Mr. THomAs GORMNa and Mr. Aa Rxkn)m LAWSON, ra,nufacturmrs of Irish eambric at Lurgan, in Ireland. Now, before recapitulating the chief facts of tshi disagireable case, we would carefully guard against exaggeration.' It is not to be suppwsed .tIat thege crinainalVproceedings of last week afford a spechimn of the average dealings of ow London,m nere ts. The colossal fabric of Dtji.M qojmorce GQ-jd uoyeerreally reMt uponte quicksands of fraud. Perhaps 90 per cent. of the values which change hands among our merchants in the course of any given year in dealt with in a legitimate manner. Enormou swindle, such as those with which the names 'of DAVBSON and GonDoN were connested, occasionally take place, but they illustrate the exception-not the rule. The records of Basinghall-street are but a brief chapter in thethronicles of English commerce. Having said thus much, lest it should be supposed that we are imparting too hiigh a colour to the picture,' it is grievous to be compelled to add that a fearful amount of trickery and rascality actually prevails. Mere lads set up in business, as it is called, with the vcry ruler and wafers in their office obtained upon credit. Upon credit, too, they obtain goods, which they either pledge or sell at one-half or onetbird of their value, and by this little maneuvre gain possession of money, which is soon destined to be dribbled away in over-expenditure, or engulfed in speculation. Two or three years generally suffice to bring their operations to a conclusion, and then there is nothing for it but the bankrupts' disgrace, or flight more disgracefll still. The commission agent makes away with the goods of his principal-this was the case of TAYLOR and MAY, the very trial of which we are about to speak. The handkerchiefs which Were the subject of the fraud were purchased by a firm which bears a high character at a price so low that it could not be supposed they had come legitimately into the hands of the vendor. The Judge who tried the case animadverted in very strong terms npon the proceeding. Stranger than all, perhaps, numerous persons wellknown in the City came forward to give high charactersto men, two of whom were immeediately marked with the stigma of a criminal sentence. The City endorsed the Scamps. The facts of the case are told in a few words *- WILLTasI TAYLoR buys and sells upon commission, and to him Mr. GoXMAN, one of the prosecutors, applied to effect a sale for him with some of the London warehousemen. Some handkerchiefs were left with TAYiOR as a sample, and soon after Mr. GonLsw, who had in the meanwhile returned to Ireland, received a letter from him, announcing that he could dispose of the goods to MAY, who carried on business as a warehouseman in Huggin-lane. The Lurgan manufacturer, however, made some inquiries concerning MAY, the result of which was unsatisfactory, and he therefore wrote to TAYLOR, telling him emphatically that he would have no dealings with that person. A short time after this Mr. GORvNAN received another letter from TAYLOR, stating that he had made preliminary arrangements for the sale of the handkerchiefs with Messrs. MYERS and Co., formerly of Ludgate-hilltradesmen of undoubted credit,-and he advised him to close with the offer. Handkerchiefs were accordingly supplied to the amount of 6471., and of these TAY-LOR acknowledged the receipt. There was, however, a hitch about the payment. TAYLOR informed his principal that the purchasers were not [quite satisfied with the price, and he had been ccmpelled to make a small deduction. A few days afterwards TAYLOR again wrote to Mr. GORsu.N, enclosing a check for 1001., but informing him that MYERS and Co. had repudiated the bargain, and, worse still, that the goods had been intercepted by M&Y. TAYLOn said, in point of fact, that MAY had stolen the handkerchiefs, inasnuch as he had come to his warehouse when he was absent, and had carried them away without his knowledge or consent. Now, it turned out that when the goods were delivered in London they had been opened in the presence of both TAYLOR and MAY, and they were subsequently disposed of by MAY to Messra. MEEX.NG and Co., of Holborn, for about, half the cost price to the manufacturer. As MYERs was acquitted by the jury, with the full approval of the presiding Judge, we need only say that the evidence to connect him with the transaetion was that he was constantly in company with MAY, and that, immediately upon the completion of the sale to MEaNINGS, MAY had, paid into the Union Bank to the credit of MYERS two checks to the amount of 1501. To proceed, however, with *the narrative of the transaction, -when Mr. GoRN arrivedin London to look after his interests TAYLOR persisted in the story that MAY had got possession of the handkerchiefs without his privity. It appeared that these two men had formerly occupied the same offices, and that at the time of these transactions they lived in the same private house at Pimlico. Mlr. GORMAN in vain endeavoured to obtain payment from any of the parties whose names were mixed up with these transactions, and so, finally, he proceeded criminally against all. It is unnecessary to enter at any length into the case of the other prosecution, which was consolidated with the one instituted at the instance of Mr. GoB-Ax. Mr. LAwsoN's case was in so far less complicated that the handkerchiefs which he forwarded to England were directly sold to MAY at the instance of TAYLOR. A biU for 2001., which he had given in part payment, was dishonoured, and a check subsequently given in compensation for the dishonour of this biU shared the same fate. Upon this state of facts the jury acquitted MYmRs, but found TAYLOR and MAY guilty. The Judge in passing sentence considered that TAYLOR had been to a certain extent the dupe and tool of MAY, and accordingly sen- tenced him to but six months' imprisonment, while' MAY was to be imprisoned for the full period of 12 months. The character given to TAYLOR was very good, but the facts against him were very bad; character, however, prevailed against facts. Now, both the persons who came forward to give this character to TAYLOR and the jury who endeavoured to give effect to their recommendations did so with a fuU knowledge of the facts of the case which had, indeed, just been proved before them in court. It may be that the man had borne a good character up to this time;if so the witnesses to character were quite in the right when they bore testimony on that point. We may doubt the fact, for it is well nigh incredible that a man's first step into crime should be so deep a one; but still it may be so. The jury, however, deliberately found the man guilty of a most atrocious fraud; and yet so little did the conviction of his guilt weigh with them that they prevzailed upon the Judge to lighten his sentence in consideration of his previous character. Had there -been any doubt as to the man's guilt, he ought not to have been convicted at all; if there were no doubt, then his previous character and position made rather against than for him. It is an invidious task at all times to argue on the side of the rigorous administration of justine, but we entreat of juries to consider the predicament of those pessons who are swindied out of- their property by these keenwitted sharpers, and the amount of misery inflicted upon them in consequence of such acts. It is easier, however, to give way to the tender emotions in the presence of actual misery and disgraeo than it is to consider hofw much misery is prevented by thre atern administration of the law. Or was it that the jury cpnsidered ' that TAYLOR had, after all, been guilty of a very venial offonce? If they w g, however,>' upon tIs point, 'they were :ight when they added to their finding an 'expression of their orpiniou, "that Messrs. YMEEINGe had not exWrcised p:oper caution m "purchasing the pr4xperty. under. such circuramn satanceft^' Baroax VXAzEhLL, too2 SC concurraiN "the observticm of the jury w<- zeference to the "condciet of Messrs.

MADAEAIcHINI'SCONcERT.-Maadamne Anlchmi I vel her annul morning concert yesterdayat, Camsnonse, Kensington, the residence of Mr Wolley Thera was, as usual, a brilliant and fashionable attendance. The beautiftal little theatre, which forms one of the principal ornaments of Campden-house, and has acquired a sort of celebrity as the arena for amateur theatrical performnaces of a high class, waa completely full, while numbers of. persons,' unable to penetrate into the Temple of Thespis, were stationed in the rooms adjacent, or perambulated in the grounds, where the band of the IEalian Legion was to play before anld after the concert-as though the programme provided by Madame Anichini for her trons didnot comprisemusic enough, vocal and instrumenta, to satisfy the most ravenous of enthu- siats. There were no less than 25 pieces in theselec| tion, and these were all of an exclusively "popular" character. Madsme Anichlni assigned herself a very modest share in the proceedings, only attempting one solo (Schubert's "Ave Maria"), and one duet, her other duties being limited to taking part in various concerted pieces The duet, In which she was supported with great ability by Signor Ciabatta, was a clever composition from Signor Vea's opera of Catherine de Cleves; and among the Concerted pieces the well known quintet from Iledermeyer's Marie Stuart-in whichthe air of " Auld lang syne"is intro._ duced-afforded Madame Anichini themaost favourable oppor. tunity of distinction. The other vocalistswere .L and haaame Gasser, who sang Senor Iradier's capital bolero " Los Toros del.Pnerto" with remarkable spirit; Signors Benevantanoand Vialetti (from Her Majesty's Theatre), who distinguished themselves in the familiar duet, for basses, from I Puritani; Herr Reichardt and Mr. Charles Braham, each of whom give a ;solo-the former a graceful romance from Mr. Benedict's Brtdes of Venice, the latter " Qaando] le sere," from Verdi's Luiea Miller-much to the general satisfaction; Madame Hertha de Westeratrand, who, in twoI of the Swedish melodies originally introduced in this country by Jenny Lind, evinced a talent which excted the sympathies of the audience; Signor Solieri, a tenor with a smell flute-like voice, who, in the duet," "All idea" (n Barbire) with M Gassier, displayed even more fluency than reverence for Rossini; Madame Clara Novello, wlho sang a very expressive romance (with harp accompaniment) from Signor Vera's opera of Adrienne lecou-reur so admirably as to obtain a unanimoas encore; Mademoiselle Ramos (from Her Majesty's Theatre), who joined Signor Ciabatta in the duet, "Per piacer," from Rossini's Turco n Intsia; M. Jules Lefort, who gave the sentimental romance, "Qae je voudrais avoir vos ailes," with great feeling, and an elegant Italian canzonet (the composition of 1i Engel) with not less effect,; Mademoiselle CoreUli, Signor Bardini, &c. In the vocal department, indeed, the attractions (of which we have only named a few) were rather too plentiful than otherwise, The pianist was Signor Andreoli, who possesses executive powers and a delcacyof touchworth devoting to better music than his own" fanasa" upon themes from the Proph1ee, wherein MTeyerheer is treated with far more liccnse than felicity. The accompanists were MM. Vera, Biletta, Pinsuti, BRandegger, and Benedict. The concert afforded the utmost gratification. DovE;, Monday, June 22.-It is reportedc that a large steamer, the Durham, of London, for Sierra Leone, went on shore at an early hour this morniag (at about 1 a.m.), during the fog, near Dangeness. We are not aware whether any serious damage has reaulted from the accident, but from the absence of inteUigencerespecting her it is probable that she bas succeeded in getting off, and has proceeded on her voyage. Thisis the more probable, from the fact that there has been little orno wind during the night, and at the present moment it is almost a calm. It is also repnorted that a brig was run down during the auight in the fOg. Shie nOW lies iu about ten fathoms, wter, and ia about four miles from the shore, nearly opposite the Admirally-pier. COLMISION IN THE CHAM-.-(By Electric and International Telegraph).-So THAwroy, Monday Evening.-The screw steamer Queen of the South, Captain Beale, arrived from Bremen, reports having been in collisin last night with a brig, which immediately foundered-crewsaved, excepting one boy. During the evening the steamer passed 300 or 400 vessels running up Channel About 11 30 p.m. the look-out reported two vessels ahead, one on each bow, both steering east. At this time the South' Foreland bore E.N.E., seven or eight miles distant; neither of the vessels exhibited lights; it was cloudy and the wind west. The two vessels were h'1f a nile ap art, andhad each of them held on their course there was plenty of room for the steamer to have passed between them withoat accident. Suddenly the brig, which was two points broad on the steamer's starboard bow, ported her helm, seeing this, the captain of the steamer was obliged to do the same to avoid a collsion,as she had another vessel on her port bow. This mistake on thepart of the brig caused a collision, as the distance between the two was not sufficient to allow both vessels to port their helms with safety. In this position a collision Dme inevitable. Atthetime the Queen of theSoathstraok thebrigshe had aheadway on herof aboutsevenknotsanhour. Captain Beale immediately had the engines reversed, and everthing that could be done to avoid a collision was done. Teberig', howvever, came right across the bo;wvof the steamer, and she was cut in two and sank directly. Three of the crew succeeded in gettiDg on board the steamer while the vessels were in contact. The lifeboat of the Qaeen of the South was lowered and picked up four more, but one boy was missing. The steamer and her boat, and also the boat of the Lord Warden, pilot cutter, of Deal, remained near the s-ene of the disaster for an hour, but could not findthe boy. Captain Beale, the pilot, and the fourth officer were on the bridge at the time of the collision; the brig, which be1l"nged to Mr. Bowman, coal merchant, of Southampton, was the Atalanta, Captain Allen, and was on her voyage f,om Southampton to Sunderland, in baliast. The captain was saved in his nightshirt, and, with the crew, was broughton here in a steamer. A dense fog set in at 3, and this detained the steamer some hours in her arrival here, she bEing obliged to proceed at half speed. The Queen of the South received no damage by the collision; she belon5s to the European and American Company, and proceeds to New York on Wednesday. DECLN OF PAUPERIsg iN IRELAND.-A small blue-book of 100 pages and upwards contains the 10th anmual report of the Boor Law Commissioners for Ireland, with copious appendices. It is dated the 1st of May, 1857. The bighest number of workhouse inmates in the series of weeks wsas 67,276 (on the26th of April, 1856), and. the lowest number 45,662 (on the 13th of September, 1856). The present number of inmates (that is to eay, on the date of the report) is 55,212. The -weekly summaries of outdoor relief show very little fluctuation; the average number of recipients was under 1,000, and the average weekly cost less than 431. per week. Both summaries-as it is trulv satisfactory to be assured-exhibit a further material decrease of pauperism andof'expenditurein Irelaied.The total number of paupers relieved dudng the year1866 was21 2.579in, doors, ane 4,o57 out of doors,against 269,794 and 35,432 (in andout of doors) in the year 1855, thus exhibiting the large decrease of 57,215 in doors and 30,875 out ot doors. The total Poor Law expenditure during the year amounted to 576,3901., against 685,2591 in 1855, equivalent to a decrease of 108,8691., no less tban 16 per cent., 'and far exceeding the remotest expectations of the commissioners at the date of their last report. The reduction of expenditure is pronounced to be almoet entirely due to the decrease of pauperism. The amount 'expended by guardians of the poor in assisting emigration to our coloniea during the year ended Mlichaelmzas.day, 1856, was 2,7191., excdusive of 1,5851. from other sources. MARIAGES AT REGISTRES' OETICExS.-4n the year 1855 the number of marriages in the offices of superintendent registrars, under the 6th and 7th of William IV., cap 85, amounted to 7.441, 'to which it had risen from 1. 3 in the year 1837-38.

Much sym thy appears to have been felt at the Cape for Mr. Good( U and his unfortunate companions. T HE ELECTRIC TL-EGRtAP IN AUSTURITA.-An interesting official statercent has been published by the Melbourne Govermment on the progress of the electric televraph in the colony of Victoria and the surrounding districts. The first electric telegraph in Victoria was opened ix March, 1854, and connected Melbourne with Williams. town. The original tariff of m ages was very bigh, tho rates being 2s. 6d. for the first 10 words of any private message, and 3d. for each additional word. At. the close of L54 ithe line was so far extended ai to oonnect Geelong with Melbourne; in January, 1e55, a communication was opened with Queenscliffe; and by the lt of July, in the same year, a branch from Melbourne to Sandridge was in full operation. These lines were altogether 72 miles long. The followin Is now the scale of charges: -For any distance under lO miles, Is. 6d. for the first 10 words and Id. for each additional word; from 10 and under 20 miles, 2s. for the first 10 a ords and 2d. for each additional word * from 20 and under 50 miles, 4. for the first 10 words aud 3d. for each additional word; from 50 and under 100 miles, 6s. for the first 10 words and 4d. for each additional word. Some altera. tjon areo now oDntemplated intheaeratesg. InthelastlO months of 1854 the number of private messages was ,287; in 1855, 9,473- aid in 1856, 10,375. The total receipts to the end of 1956 from private messages were 6,611. The salaries and worldng expenses during the same period were 12,4691.; but, in addition to pnrvate messages, 6,814 messages on the public semece were transmitted, the value of which, if estimated according to the usual scale, would be -.5331., leaving a balance in favour of the telegraphs of 6M5. in three years. The cost of the construetion of the telegraph has been charged to the revenue of the colony, ad has' been Tery considerable. The first, between Melbourne and Williamstowx, was contracted for at 1931. 15s. per mile; and the second, between Williamstown and Queensoliffe; at 115. 15s. More recently, however, the contrxeat have been taken ata uuebn lower -ate, in cn. - sequence of the great reduction in the cost of labour and zmatunials. In November, 1855, it was decided to exend. the lines from Gcelontto Ballt and from Melbourne to Sandhurst vidCastlemaire. Estimates and specificatioas of' the work were prepared, aind the sum of 1S,OOOl. was qlacedI upon the-votes for the pntpose of meeting the necesswaex- penditure.

While holding out the manifold advantages of pC ace, plenty, and prosperity, and2 now and then, liberty, to the enlightened citizens who may vote for the candidates whose names are affixed to them, some of those documents, though not so utterly grotesque as many which saw the light during the Republican saturnalia of 1848, as enot, however, totally deficient inthisrespect. I find none, for instance, to match the address of a certain citizen, " Borme, fils," and which, with many others of a similar kind, compose a curious collection entitled Les Murailles RevolutionnaziresoLo of the most extraordinary records of the deliriunm of the publio mind under the influence of revolution. Whenever the annals of France in 1848 ccme to be published the IlMuraiVc Revoltionnaires will he as valuable to the historian of that day as the Ami du Petle of the hideous Marat, or the YViux Cordelier of that witty gamin Camille Desmoulins. Citizen Borme, fla, grounded his claims to the notice and the gratitude of his fellowcountrymen on the following:- "Citizen Borme, fias-inventor of many war machines, throwing 300 baUs or grape packages per minute, Inventor of the Greek fire, by means of which the enemy's fleet may Zhe burnt or sunk, author also of the means by which 2,000 iemale citizens may resist 50,000 enemies of the male sex,to the cUizesses of Paris. My sisters in tho Ropublio! "Citizenes,-The Republic is indebted to you for the l?ourth part of its existence; it is by your exhortations that your fathers, your brothers, your friends have braved the grapeshot of the 24th of February. You have well deserved of the country, ctizenesses, and it is for that reason that I cail upon the Provisional Government to embody you luto a regiment, to be called the 'WVsuviennes.'

Vive, vive, vive la B-publiqueI "Paris, March, 1848. " BORME, Fils." In the lists of candidates now patronized by the Siedle, Presse, 1)9bats, and Estafette we find some who formed part of the Provisional Government to whom that strange demand was addressed. In accordance with it there presented themselves on the 26th of March, 1848, between 11 and 12, in the Place Vend6me, a legion of women from 15 to 30, carrying Bsgs inscribed with the word " Vsuvienne" in large gold letters. These Amazons marched to the Hotel do Vile, and paraded before the Provisional Government, from whom they demanded aid and protection, and the first community of "Vesuviennes" was established at BelleviUle. Another citizen of that day put himself forward on the ground of his having demanded as indispensable to the Republic the immediate construetion of a Coliseum like that at Rome, where 20,000 citizens should daily deliberate on affairs of State. A third, named Wattebled, who described himself as " the friend of humanity by character, and a physician by profession," proposed himself as a candidate for the Presidency of the Bepublic, and pledged himself, if he were elected to that high post, to give advice and medicine gratis every day to all the sick in France and the colonies. Another, whogavehimself thesoundingtitle of "Bellritnger at the Church of St. Eustache," claimed to be elected to the Nationai Assembly, and declared that he was ready to give his professional assistance grats whenever called upon to do so. His namewas Aniral (Admiral), and he added the words " de la Seine," il order, as he said, not to be confounded with the " other Admirals of France." He was asked by a deputation of electors his motive for becoming a r'presentative of the people. He replied that, as he had been very unhappy in hisr matrimonial life, he was sure of succeeding as a public man. Another citizen of Paris, named Bourgeois, addressed a ithy profession of faith to the electors, which at al events, remarkable for its frankness"Name Bourgeois; he is veryfpoor, but he has no talent. " We have at the present day an address or two -which now and then remind us of those good times. A certain M. Charlemagne Bejot, a gardener by profession, makes the most tempting promises to the electors. If he is named member of the Legislative Body his efforts as a leglqlator will, it seems, be directed to the planting of maypoles crowned with roses in all the public squares in France; and, instead of the statues that adorn the towns and public gardens, he will substitute beds of the most fragrant flowers. "I n the court of the Louvre," he says, " I will substitute for the marble and bronze figures all that France produces of the most beautiful ard gorgeous-a rosetree of one hundred leaves, encircled by six peach trees, tended by a gardener cf talent." Wl'hat effect these fiowery promises wiU produce on the electors of Paris remains to be seen. Another citizen, named Bertron, takes a higher flight. He proposes bimself as a candidate at once for the 86 departments of France. His claim to public attention is, he says, his humanity, and he only wants to be the candidate of the humane. "The whole of society," M. Bertron says, "is divided into two classes-the humane and the inhuman. I do not ask for the suffrages of the latter." We must wait till Wednesday to know whether M4. Bertron will be treated with humanity or otherwise by his fellow-citizens. Certainly these addresses are harmless when we contrast them with the inflaiumatory exhortations of the demagogues of 1848, but they show what eccentricities and exceeses rould characterize the candidates of the day if circumstances wereesimilar to those of 1848. The quarrel between the "Ancients," the Democratic Committee of the Rue Gallon, and the Democratic coalition of the SiMcle and Dtbats, has, as I anticipated, become embittered. The correspondence between DI. Emile Ollivier (the Si&ce candidate) and M. Garnier Pagzs, that of the "Ancients," and, as he is often reminded, of the 45 centimes, appears to-day in the former paper. It began, I think, with " Mon cher Garnier Pags," and "Mon cher Olvier ;" it then calmed down to " Mon cher Monsieur C'arnier Pages," and vice verse; it then elided into " Mon cher Monsieur," and reciprocally, and so on through the whole gamut of epistolary affection, till It fell flat into " Monsieur." It is useless to enter into the particulars of this " decline andfall" of the connexion; it vill suffice to say that M. Garnier Pages complains of being treated unhandsomely by his Democratic brethren, to whom he applies, by implication, the term "feonie." "Judge yourself," the indignant ox-Ministersays; "you would certainly say that (if I had acted no), I had committed an act of felowie towards you"-I qote jai commis 1 acte de felonie e1ers seons." lt is after this accusation of foul play that 1. Ollivier freezes his correspondent by addressing him as "Monsieur." The cause of all_this bitternesisthat M. Ollivier was starteci by the Democratic lectoral Committee in the same electoral district in Paris aM 1V. Gamier Pages, and refused to give way. The Tournw des D8lats has abstained for the last two or three days from publishing The list of candidates it adopted concurrently withtheSiWle. Hasitgrown ashamedof its mrotMg6s, and does it decline accompanying them to the ballot-box? It probably thinks, like Grumio, ihat " there are none but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory," that is, Al. de Laboulaye, Gener Cavaignac, and M. de Lasteyrie, and of these the first only can possibly have any real sympathies with the Debats. What particularly strikes one on a survey of the men who have come -forward as candidates for the Legislative Body is the small number of eminent or influential names either on the side of the Government or of the Opposition. Attempts were made to draw from their retreats a few of those who, in other times, occupied a distinguished Place in the political world, but without effbet; and the candidates who bave come forward as representing the Demo-ratic party would perhaps, withfew exceptions, be disavowed even b theNational, were it in existence. The merits of the respective candidates have been already noticed. I may now say a few words on the operations wbich opened at 8 o'clock this morn- inginiall the Mairiesof thearrondftsemients of Paris.4 I have just paid a short visit to moat of them,-vi., 1 the first, second, third, uixtb,X eighth, tenthb, eleventh, and twelfth. I remarked that the nutnber of elector3 who attencded for the purpose of voting is less than might have been expected in proportiqn to the voting tickets which had been taken out; and these tickets, so far as I can ascertain, exceed in number those which were delivered in 1852, when General Cavaignac and M. Carnot were also candidates. Another peculiarity which distinguishes the present elections in Paris is the far larger number of tickets taken out by the working and poorer classes, who have flocked in greater numbers fortheir tickets than the bourgeoisie. Thereason for the small number polled when compared with the 350,000 registered electors inParis and theBanlieue, is said to be a recommendation previoudy given to the workmen and the poorer popiulation not to vote on the first day of the election. Rightly or wrongly, they entertained the suspicion that during the night, between the hour of closing on Sunday evening and of recommencing on Monday mornmng, the toozealous agents of the Government might take upon themselves to remove the aeals which are affixed to the ballot-boxes before being transferred to the respective Miries, abstracting the tickets that were unfavourable to the Government candidate, and substituting others of a contrary description. This feeling acquired for the last few days such consistency among the working class, ever suspicious of the good faith of those in power, that in the Banlieue the National Guard requested to be allowed to take the place of the regular soldiers, to whose care the ballot-boxes are intrusted during the night. The Government at once acceded to the request. The workmen know that as the clock strikes 4 tomorrow evening the voting ends, that the ballotboxes wiU then be opened for the purpose of counting the votes, and that trickery is hardly possible. The usual guard of the ballot-boxes in each Mairie is a detachment of 25 soldiers of the line, under the command of a Lieutenant. The working people who have voted to-day are those who are not in the habit of losing a day's labour, orof observingwhatis called"SaintMonday." The immense majority who spend Sunday outside the barriers will vote early to-morrow. It appears that a pledge has been given to that effect reciprocally. The aspect which the voting places abovementioned presented this forenoon was In general not very animated. The Democratic Opposition are of course still under the impression that two of the candidatesviz., General Cavaignac and M. Camnot, will be elected; some few appear equally certin about MM. Goudchaux and Bethmont; though the general impression is that the first two only have a real chance. There is nothing, however, more uncertain than a calculation based upon universal sufrage by any party; it baffles all conjecture, and, as a general rule, it is well not to come to any conclusion until the last voting ticket is opened. The question of the oath remains in suspense. It appears certain, however, that several of the candidates, if elected, and particularly General Cavaignac and M. Camnot, will refuse to take it. They will probably repeat on this occasion the protest they made in 1852, and which the present Minister of the fnterior, then President of the Legislative Body, read to the H ouse on the 30th March of that year. It was to this effect: "The electors of Paris and Lyons came to seek us in our retreat, or in our exile. We thauk them for having thought that our names were of themselves a protest against the overthrow of public liberty, and against arbitrary rigour. But we do not adut that they meant to end us to ait In a Legislative Body the powers of which do not go so far as to repair the violation of right. We reject the iumoral theory of silence and of mental reservation, and we refuse the oath required on admission to the Legislative Body." If, then, General Cavaignac and M. Carnot be elected on the present occasion, and refuse to take their seats, a new election becomes necessary, and it is more than probable that the majority of the Parisian population would again return them, were it only to give the usual "lesson" to the Government. What the Opposition naturally desire is to keep up the greatest agitation possible among the masses. The Government, it is said, has a measure in contemplation to meet this system of tactics. Should the Opposition candidates be again returned, the Legislative Body will be without loSE of time convoked ad hoc, and a project of law proposed which, for the future, will require every candidate to make a declaration at the time of depositing his ticket, pledging himself, in ease of election, to take the oath as prescribed by the law. Some believe that the same thing will be done by a Senatus-Consultum, and that candidates will he thus prevented from offering themselves merely for the purpose of agitation. It is said that the Pope has expressed a wish that, at the approaching elections, the clergy shall votefor the Government candidates. The Moniteur announces that at 9 o'clock on Friday morning last the Emperor granted a private audience to the delegates of the attorneys (avoues) from the departments. The purpose of this audience was to permit the attorneys to present an address to His Majesty, in which they expressed the great alarm which a late proposition submitted to the Senate by the Baron de Crouseilhes had causcd them. His Majesty received them with marked kindness; he expressed his astonishment at their uneasiness; he admitted the services rendered by the attorneys as a body, and he declared that his Go. vernment had no intention of trenching ox their privileges. His Majesty added, that if the idea of diminishing the expense of law proceedings was to be applied it would be chiefly by moderating the Treasury fees; and to an observation made to him, that the object of Baron de Crouseilhes' proposition, on the contrary, was solely to reduce the attorneys' fees, the Emperor said, " that would not be just. ' In fine, His Majesty, being informed that the alarm was such that the transmnisiaon of the office of attorney was in some measure suspended, spontaneouslydeclared to the delegates that anarticle should be inserted in the Moniteur which would remove all uneasiness. The delegates retired fully satisfied, commisaioned to communicate this good news to all the attorneys. One of the Emperor's Aides-de-Camp left Paris this morning for Wurtemberg. He is commissioned to present the compliments of their Majesties to the Dowager-Empress of Russia, who is at present at Wildbad. The draught of the Treaty of Commerce signed on the 34th inst. at St. Petersburg was received in Paris yesterday. It was presented to the Emperor for his signature, and it wil be sent back to St. Petersburg to-morrow, where the exchange of the ratifications is to take place. Count de Morny will then return to Paris. The Rus3ian Government has authorized the Emperor of the French to take copies of the French manuscripts in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg, which afford valuable information with respect to the history of.the 18th century. The Government has received information that the Chinese who murdered the captain of the French brig Anais had been arrested by the French Admiral in the China Seas, and subsequently tried on board the Virginie and executed. The following fact is official :-Tke Pope has expressed his gratiude to Count de Rayneval for the visit paid his Holiness by the Chevalier Boncompagi, on the part of the KZing of Sardinia. The Hloly Father attributes this visit to the friendly Intervention of the Emperor of the l?rench. AIUSTRIA. (FROM OpR OWN COnRaPONnnT.) VIENNA, JTm 19. I send you to-day an account of the festival in honour of the hundreth anniversary of the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theres For the last two or three days Vienna-which at this season of the year is usually as empty as London in September-has been full of rmilitary men, who have come from far and near to witness the festival which was yeaterday celebrated within the walls of this city. Militaryfetes are in general very much alike, but as the festival of yesterday was perfectly unique I shall give you a detailed account of it. On Wednesday, the 17th, most of the Enights of the Order of Maria Theresa were to be seen in the streets of Vienna, and great was the respect shown by the other officers to the envied possemors of the cross, which is the reward either of brilliant acts of courage, or of some happy inspiration exercising a decisive influence on the isue of a battle. If an officer has displayed extraordinary self-devotion and contempt of danger, he, " at the recommendation of his comrades,'? obtains the Knight's Cross of the Order; if a superior officer acts on his own responsibility without orders from his chief and by no doing tums th e tide of war i favour of the flag under which he serves; he " on the strength of evidence given by his fellows," receives the Commrianders urom, The GrwA Cmo is given only to those commanders who have fought and won a pitched battle, or have taken the initiative in critical moment$, and by so. doing have, Paved their country from some great danger. Th only Grand Crosses are the Archduke John (1809), Marshal Count Radetzky (1848), and Marshal Prince Windischgritz (1850). The ten Commanders are the King of Wirtemberg, Marshal Count Nugent (1813), who is an Irishman by birth, Count Jellachich, Baron Hess, Count Thurn, the Archduke Albrecht, Count Wimpffen, Count Schlick, ths Neapolitan General Filangieri, and the Russian General Liiders (1849). There are 79 Austrian and some 22 foreign KniRhts. The only foreign Knights who were present at the festival were Prince Charles of Bavaria, Sir Fairfax Moresby, Laord Seaton, General Suchosanet, and General Panintine. General Filangier4, who was on his way here from Naples, fell ill at Trieste, where he is now lying. Lord Seaton has produced a very favourable impiession on the Austrian officers, but the free anl easy manners of the gallant Admiral are not exactly to their taste. Every officer who passed Sir Fairfax Moresby in the street saluted him, but the unceremonious sailor either altogether neglected to return the salute, or did so by a patronizing kind of movement of his liand. The indignant warriors were at first inclined to take offence, but they recollected that the Admiral wore the cross of their cherished military Order, and consequently did not let him remark that they considered him uncourteous, In the evening of thel7th there was a prelude to the festivities of the following day in the shape of a grand tattoo, which was executed by seven bands anda host of regimental drummers. This deafening tattoo was beaten in the principal court of the Paliace, before the houses inhabited by the tbree grand crosses of the Order, and " am tof " in front of the War-office. Several piecees of music were played by the seven bands in the course of the evening to a crowd sch as has seldom been seen in the streets of this city. It wtill be no exaggteration to say that some 60,000 or 70,000 persons were " jammed" Into the triangle formed by the Palace, Graben and Schotten-gate. It was not until after midnight that peace and quiet were restored, but at 5 in the morning I01 guns, fired fom the ramparts, reminded the inhabitants of the "Emperor's City" that the real festival was only about to begin. Of the grand musical "reveille" it is but necessary to say that it was nearly as noisy as the tattoo of the preceding evening. At 9 o'clock a military mass was read on the glacis, where some 30,000 men of all arms were drawn up in two lines of battle. Just outside the so-called " Franzens-gate," was a lofty marquee which had been fitted up as a chapel, and directly opposite wasthe tent of the Imperial family. Six smaller tents-three on each side of the two former-were placedatthe disposal of themembersof the Order, of the general officers, of-the heads of the Administration, and of such other persons as had been fortunate enough to obtain a ticket of admission. On the outside of the enclosed space abova 100,000 persons must have been assembled, but in and around the tents there were not more than 1,600 or 1,600 persons. At 9 o'clock the Emperor, accompanied by the Knights of the Order, some 3) generals, and one officer from each of the regiments of the Austrian army, galloped up from the citymoat to the glacis, and soon afterwards the Archduchess Sophia appeared in an open carriage, followed by seven others of a. similar description, in which were ladies attached to the Imperial Court. Among the few persons who were .admittd into the enclosed space was a hale old gentlemau, evidently a foreigner, who seemed to take very great interest in everything that was passing. For a time he attracted no particular notice; but an officer chanced to remark that he wore the Austrian silver medal for courage, which mark of distinction is only given to common soldiers. As the possessor of the medal also had a commander's cross of a foreign orderthe curiosity of the public was excited, and a little crowd was soon collected around him. The stranger was by no means loth to reply to the leading questions put to him, and this was his simple tale. He had been a private in the Austrian army, had won his medal 50 years ago, and having heard that the centenary of the Order of Maria Theresa was to be publicly celebrated he had been unable to resist the temptation of coming to see the "glorification" of his ancient brethren in arms. The gentleman, a Walloon, whose name, I believe, is Raters, is now extremely rich, and was Burgomaster of Antwerp in 1830. Hi waited on the Empernr a few days ago and met with as kindly a reception as if he had been a Grand Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa. After having ridden along the front the Imperial family took the seats prepared for them, and the mass began. On the right of the Imperial tent sate the Grand Crosses and Commanders of the Order, and on the right and left the Knights. The two tents nearest the temporary chapel were occupied by the ladies who had received tickets of admittance. At the Gospel, consecration of the 0ost, and Te Deum the troops fired by platoons, and the guns on theramparts gave the responses with a vigour which terribly shook the nerves of the female spectators. In general the battalions fired as one man, but some of the mixed battalions " made a sad mess of the thing," thereby causing very considerable annoyance to the Emperor, whose duties as a Commander somewhat iaterfered with his duties as a Christian. Whenever a spluttering platoon was heard His Majesty's head invariably turned to the side from which the obnoxious sound came, but when the discharge was unisonant the Imperial countenance was steadfastly directed towards the altar. After the mass was over the troops filed off in companies before the Emperor, so that the ceremony was not over until midday. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the banquet took place in tShe galleries and garden of the Palace of Schonbrunn, but the arrangements were such that no complete view of the whole scene could be obtained. 120 persons sate down to table with the Emperor. 50 persons were placed at another table in the palace, and the officers and privates deputed by the various regimients and military institutions dined in the garden. Several toasts were drunk, but it is only necessary to quote the speech of His Majesty. It ran as followvs: "With just confidence I welcome the day which comn. pletes for my army a whole century of glory and military honour, as the beginning of a new er& of glory and honour for Ausrla and her military power. I yield to the dictate of my hearb when I take advantage of this festlval to expresc to the Knights of my Order of St. Theresa the thanks of their Sovereign, and to my gallant army the sincero acknowledgments of its Emperor and Commander. " With heartfelt sympathy 1 think of the absent-wit; deep grief of those who have ceased to be. "To the memory of the Empress Mari Theresa, the ilustrious founlder of the order I To the Knights of my Order of Maria Theresa ! To my valiant army, and to its eaders " The Imperial speech was received wwih thunders of applause, which were echoed by a battery that as placed near the so-called "Gloriette," at the oppo^^ite extremity of the garden. By rar tse most imposing part of the festival was the " Theatre Par6," in the Opera-house. The reyresentation was to have commenced at half-past 7, but the Court didjnot arrive until a quarter past 8. The Lord Chamberlain was so hard pressed by the publie for tickets that he was nece8sitated to put two and even three persons of different families into the same box. Thus Baron A. Rothschild, one of the chiefs of the Austrian Credit Bank, and Baron G. Sina, one of the greateat supporters that the French Or&dit Mobilier has in Austria, received tickets for- the same box. Baron Rothschild returned his ticket at once, and, as Baron Sina made no use of his, the box, for which at least 100g. would wilingly have been given, remained unoccupied. The first row in the pit was filled with the ladiei of the families of the Knights of the Order and with general officers, the second with the highe3t civil dignitaries and their female relatives. Thi three t;ers of boxes were occupied by the Knight, of the Order, the foreign Ministers, and some few ladies of the highest rank. The stalls of the thira gallery were filled by general officers., ladies, and two persons in black coats and white neckerchieFs, one of whom was your correspondent. The stalls of the fourth gallery were occupied by Governmeat employes, and the other seats by " decorated" non- commissioned officera. The fifth gallery was filled 'with private soldiers in possession of the gold or silver medal for courage. With such a house it need niot be said that the reception given to the Emperor was " tremendous." The cry of "' wvcdir' lasted for some minutes, and an Hungarian, who was probably vexed that the Germans had overpowered his voice, ejaculated the national " EljenP' as the Cou t w,re settling into their ats. The performance comniencod Witt a prologue, which nlv.t bave prodiAQ .d an indeliblo impresaion on the military part of the audience as it electrified even me. The Mrs. Siddons of this country, who was dressed as "6 Austra," declaimed the prologue, and at that part of it m which it is said that the Order was founded " by the Mother of the Imperial House," in commemoration of all the battles which Austrian arms have ever fought, the theatrical clouds slowly disappeared and displayed a most perfect tableau in a frame, representing the Emperor Francis L in an armchair, with the Empress Maria Theresa opposite, about to lay on the table the statutes of the Order for the signatare of His Majesty. In the backgrouna are the Archduke Joseph (afterwards Joseph IL), Charles Duke of Lorraine, and the Counts Kaunitz, Daun, Lacy (an Irishman), and Laudon. As the officers of the Austrian regiment " Zach" (No.15) could not induce itto attaek the French daring the second day of the battle of A spern (1809), the Archduke Charles rode up to the spot where it was osted, seized the flag of the regiment, and declared that he himself would lead it on to the attack. The presence and example of the Commander-in-Chief produced amagical effect on the discouraged soldiers, and they made a charge which disconcerted even their gaUant adversaries. The foregoing fact formed the subject of the second tableau. Of course, the uorineipal figure in the picture is the Archduke bharles. Count Grunne, the father of the present first Adjutant-General, who is the only other mounted figure, was the Adjutant of the AusLrian Generalissimo. The third tableau, a group of &ustrian soldiers of all arms aroundthe nationalflag, appeared to me to surpass in effect the second. The prologue teems with allusions to the loyalty of the Austrian army, and it must hie confessed that it richly deserves the complim. ~ta which it has reeeived. Ead it not been for the wonderful esp-it de corps of the army and the moral courage of Radetzky, Windiscwhgrtz, JeLlahich, &c. the empire could hardly have failed to be dismembered in 1848. The performance concluded with Schiller's Wailen;stein's Lager (Camp.) The cheering after each tableau was most enthusiastic. After the performance His Majesty sent a very handsome bracelet with emeralds and brilLiants to Madame Rettich, the talented actress who spoke the prologue. While the third tableau was exhibited, the Radetzky March, which is a wonderfully fine specimen of military music, was played. The poor Empress passed the whole day in complete solitude at Laxenburg. SPAIN. (MOY Oun owN CORRESPONDN.) MfADRUD, JUNE 17. The Spanish Government having at last decided to accept the resignation of Marshal Serrano, today's papers are full of conjectures as to who will succeed him as Ambassador in Paris. The Duke de Rivas, Senor MOn, and even the Duke d'Ossuna, are putforward as likely candidates. The Duke de Rivas has been spoken of before as having a good chance when a vacancy should occur. He is understood to be desirous of the post. A man of refined and literary tastes, the intellectual circles of Paris have doubtless many attractions for him which he can hardly find here. Senor Mon is at present at Rome and it seems improbable that he will he removed thence until he has completed the negotiations which were the object of his going there. That the Duke d'Ossuna should be appointed to so important a diplomatic post appears very unlikely. He is not a diplomatist, and if he was sent to IRussia it was merely because there was nothing to be done there but to make a good figure and spend a great deal of money, which he was expected to do, and has done; and, in return, the Russians have made so much of him that he has fallen in love with them, and proposes remaining some time in the country, although his temporary and special embasy is now at an end, and Senor lsturlz is on his way to relieve him. This gentleman, however, lingers in Paris, which he is not expected to leave until the end of this month, and it is said that he stil cherishes hopes of. avoiding the far North, to which he seems to have a great repugnance, attributable, perhaps, to his advanced age and love of ease. He probably hopes that a little delay at the right moment may save him the journey to St. Petersburg, and land him safely in the Rue de Courcelles, or, perhaps, at his old quarters in London-the latter if Gonzales Bravo should enter the Ministry. The papers give contradictory accounts of the state of Catalonia, which, according to the most favourable staternents, appears to be far from satisfactory. The depression in the manufacturing districts is very great, and, although some of the*manufacturers, with their warehouses full of unsaleable goods, continue giving their men employment at a positive loss to themselves, this cannot last, and already numbers are out of work and starving. The long duration of the scarcity of food, and the high prices that still prevail, have of course lessened the home demand for manufactures, and there is no foreign demand for such dear and inferior goods. It is one of the natural evil consequences of the Spanish system of protecting bad manufactires at the expense of the agricultural portion of the community-a spinning minority favoured at the cost of an immense wine, oil, and corn-growing majority-that, when a scarcity and the high price of bread compel the lower, and even the middling classes, to restrict their purchases to absolute necessaries, and the demand for whatever is not indispensable greatly diminishes, the manufactures can find no outlet abroad, and at the time of the greatest need the artisan remains without resources. Disturbances may be looked for in Catalonia. Indeed, several cases have already been cited, although the Government journals have attempted to deny and make light of them. The Three per Cents, were done at 40 60; dittD Defarred, 26 35.

Two persons, a warehouseman and an agent, were indicted for obtaining goods on false pretences from an Irish manufacturer, and the evidence, which resulted in their being found guilty and sentenced respectively to 6 and 12 months in the House of Correction, clearly established two things-first, that the provincial manufacturers, in their reckless competition with each other, are apt to be indifferent as to the description of people they employ to force off their goods in the metropolis; and, secondly, that facilities are given in wealthy q^uarters -to enable such goods to be dishonestly disposed of. Mr. Gorman, a manufacturer of Irish cambric at Lurgan, employed, it appears, a Mr. Taylor, one of the prisoners, who had been recommended to him by a very respectable friend, to dispose of goods to the amount of 6471. in the London market. Taylor wrote that he could sell them to May, the other prisoner, a warehouseman, bat Mr. Gorman, it seems, even in Ireland had already heard enough of May's dealings to refuse trusting him on any terms. The prisoner Taylor then got up a pretended sale to another person, who was reputed to be of proper character, but meanwhile concerted a plot with May that May should take away the goods, sell them on any terms, and then decamp, he, Taylor, at the same time feigning to be an innocent dupe of May's villany. Thus far the affair bad no feature beyond the most ordinary swindling. The most interesting point to the commercial cormmunity is that which follows. May, having got possession of the goods, took them apparently to some of the principal London houses, who refased, one after the other, to purchase them. The refusal was attributed by May's counsel to the market being glutted with similar articles, but such things always have a fair price, and it may be assumed thst May's want of succes is rather to be attributed to commendable caution on the part of those to whom he applied, who could not help suspecting that a " bargain" offered them by a person of his reputation was not likely to have anything to recommend it. If all traders were equally vigilant the vocation of such men would soon be ended. Unhappily, however, May found an establishment where there was less difficulty. The manufacturing cost of the goods was 6171., and Measrs hIeeking and Co., a large and well-known firm in Hlolborn, obtained them for 4091., under which circumstances they would, of course, be able to undersell rival houses, and especially thosewho, in the exercise of prudence for the common protection of all, had actually declined to take advantage of their colleagues by encouraging such transactions. Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Taylor's counsel; complained that his client should have been placed in his presont position, " while the Messrs. Meeking, who had purchased these goods so. much under their real value, were salved over as respectable people ;" and his remark was responded to by an involuntary burst of applause. The jury also expressed an opinion on the point; and finally the judge, Mlr. Baron Channell, pronounced that such a proceeding was calculated to strike at the root of all honest commercial transactions. It may be hoped, therefore, that an impression has been produced which will have a salutary iafluencea in awakening circumspection, if nothing better, on the part of all traders who may be disposed to laxity ia the means they employ for catting against each other. Messrs. Meeling are not reported as having been called as witnesses during the trial, and consequently it does not appear whether they have any esplanation to offer; but, apart from the price at which they obtained the goods, it is a bad feature that they can scarcely have been in the dark as to the character of May.' Even at Lurgan his fame had reached, and he had been a bankrupt in 1851 under circumstances the nature of which may ba surmised from the fact that his counsel objected to their being unfolded. Persons in business complain of the risks of trade, and the public are made to pay the increased charges necessary to cover them; but, as a general rule, the whole of these risks are primarily attributable to their own want of mutual good faith and the neglect of proper precautions. Such small creatures as the prisoners in the present case could do nothing if they did not find support from the greedy eagerness of persons in a much better position. If manufacturers, instead of trusting for orders to the character of their productions and the regular demands of the market, will employ agents like Taylor to push off goods of which there is already a glut, and if men of this description can always count upon some wealthy London establishments to enter into transactions with them, the commercial world must recognize that their chief dangers are the result solely of their own demoralization. The Paris letters state that the rate of exchange is showing a tendency to decline, owiug to the Bank of France no longer requiring bills to pay for gold. According to some accounts the conclusion arrived at with regard to the yield of silk is that it is only one-third of an average crop. On the other hand, the promises of the grain harvest, both in France and Agiers, are magnificent. It is also considered that the grape disease has disappeared, and that the vintacge will be unusually large, although as to the quality of the wine it is yet too early to form an opinion. With regard to a reduction of the ra'e of discount the most prudent persons are still desirous it should be delayed, but the opinion, espe ciallv among those who look to political motives, is that it wil take place almost immediatelv. From Hamburg it is mentioned that the rate of discount has again risen to 7 nor cent. The amountof bullion brought by the Arabia from New York is fuUy as large as was anticipated, the totals being 353,0001. for England and 100,0001. for France. The advices on this occasion state that a stil greater quantity wonld have been sent but that it was found impossible to effect the requisite insurance. In preparation, therefore, for future remittances, large policies have to-day been opened in London. Although the moniey-market, even in the face of these heavy shipments, continued to show considerable ease, there had been a sudden and extremely severe renewal of the faZl in almost all the leading descriptions of railway securities. Erie had gone from 37i to 30 on the publication of a report exhibiting a, loss of 14,5001. on the worling of the line for the Pix months ending the 31st of March,-a result attributed partly to lomses from the strike of the engineers on the line some time back, and partly to the intense cold of the past winter. The final transoA. tions were at 301, and as the traffic receipts wre still understood to be poor as compared with last year, there was little tendency to recovery. The adverse speculators were consequently aca'dng -with increased boldness, and the panic hAd affected,. although in a less degree, the stock ri every other company, }'ananialiad receded from 97 to934 Reading, from S1} to 78 * New 'ork Central, from 87 to 51 ; and Illinois 6ents.i, from 891 premium L o3.Otof the regoiot of the Stik iicre buAiness was pur u-ngaiA, y conj e.

At lottingham the purchases of lace have been on a slightly increased scale, but for hosiery the demand remains very dulL Inu the woollen districts and the Irish Iinen-rmakets tbre has been no alteration. The departures from the port of Londoni for the Australian colonies during the past week have cOmprisedfour vemels, two to Port Philip and two' to Sydney, with an aggregate capacity of 3,535 it4s. The rates of freight exhibit general heavine. At a meeting of the Turkish Gas Company, held to-day, resolutions were passed, authorizing a disolution, and a return of Is. 6d. per shaire out of 2s. 6d. paid, the remainder having been absorbed iu preliminary expenses. The Committee of the Stock-Exchange have appointed Friday, the 26th inst., as the settUng-day for the Levant Mineral registered shares, wbichare to be quoted in the official list. With regard to the general business of the por <f London during the past week, the total of ships rl ported inward was 198, showing an increase of 24 over the previous week. The number cleared outward was 138, including 26 in ballast, being. the same as in the previous week.

DEESIDE EXTENSION. A special meeting of the shareholders was held at Aberdeen on Friday, to coanider a Bul now before Parlianment for the extension of the line from Bapeory to Aboyne. Mr. DoNcar, the chairman of the company, said the Bill for the Deeside Extension scheme had sed the House of Commons, and was now sabmitted for their approval before it was sent to the House of Lords. The landed proprietors In the district through which the line would pas thad come forward most liberally in support of it, and the tenant farmers had also taken a substantial interest in the project. The proprietors of the Deeside line would ha've 5,0001. value of the stock, andl supply the rolling-stock at cost price. Be had no doubt that theo extension would be a very satisfactory concern. The amount of share capital was 80,0001., and teberrowi powers 26,0001. There was aprovision in the bito the tlpect that an amalgamation with the Deeside shouild take place when the dividends on beth lines were the same, or so soon as three-fifths of the shareholders shouald approve it.

LAW RBEPORT. COURT OF OuHN7s tRv, o-n _ 1lTs ROYA-.. Torn'!- --- (SWigns at NiZi Prius before bc CLPr an Speca Turies.i At the sitting of the Court this morning his Royal h. i ness the Pzince of Wales accompanied Lord Campbell int3! court, and took his seat by his Lordships side. His Royal' Highne3s remained during the trial of the case of " Side-' bottom v. Adkins," and paid great attention to the proceedl ings. At the close of the trial lis Royal Highness shook hands with Lord Campbell, and; having bowed to tho iury, left the court accompanied by his tutor. SDXBOTIOM V. AD)fS. Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., M1r. Overend, and Mr. Haw. kins appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Mlacaulay, Q.C., Mr. Huddleston, and lIr. Lush for the defendant. Mr. H&wicms, the junior counsel for the plaintiff, said the plaintiff, John Sidebottom, sued the defendant, James Adldns, to recover the sum of 6,525., under the oonnt for money had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff's use. The defendant pleaded the general issue, the Statute of Limitations, andcalso a set-off Mr. ED=wT JArmS, in opening the case, said the action was brought under very peculiar circumstances, to rocover the sum of 6,525& which the plaintiff had lost to the defendant at play. The plaintiff, who was a very young mani, belonged to a respectable family at Machester, who were millowners, and the defendant was for. merly the keeper of a gamabling-house, called the Berkeley Clab, in Albemarle-street, Piccadilly. The action was brought to recover back that sum of money, which had been lost to the defendant at play at that slab. If the money had boee lost fairly the plaintiff would have thought it dishononrable to seek to recover it back again; but after he hadlostnearly 25,000h it came to hisknowledgo that the money had been won from him by cheating and false play. He learned that false dice had been us3d, and while, he a young man, was primed with wine, his money was won from him by men who were termed " bonnets," by cheating and fraud. The learned counsel said it would be necessary for himto inform the jury that the game of hazad was played vith dice; and that there were certin persons employed by the keepers of gambling-houses, who were called " bonnets," to whom loaded dice were given. These loaded dice were made by inserting a heavy metal] (platinum) on one side, which bad the effect that that side. would not turn up. There were also certain kinds of aloe e named " despatches," some of which had none but odd numbers on them, and others none but even numbers If the were loaded it vwas lmost certain that those who used themwould win. It would be shown that it was by me3ansl of such loaded dice, used by " bonnets," that the plaintiff I had been defrauded ef his money; and, under these circum. stances, the plaintiff had brought the present Action to recover back his moRay. The learned coidel then called the following witnesses: John Sidebottom examined by Mr. &wnsrus, said,-I am a momber of the firm of Sidebottom and Co., cotton. spinners, of M1anchester. I know the defendant. I became acquainted with him in 1846. I was introduced to him at the Berkeley gaming-house, in Albemarle-street, by a friend. I was 27 or 28 years of age. From that time 1 played there. I ceasd to play there in 1853. I$layed rhere four or five times a-year on my occasional visits to London. On the first occasion I played I be3ieve I 1o3t 8,0004. I don't recolect on any occasion leaving off a winner. Altogether I lost 25,0001. The game at which I played was hazardL It is played with dice. The person who keeps the establishment is called the banker. He sits at the table, and the people round profess to play against the bank. The defendbnt was almost always present when Iplayed, Sonietimeg he was at the table, but generally at a desk in the corner. Re evidently took the management of the whole affiri. He had a brother sometimes present. He sat at the table as croupier. I have seen a person named Russell there of&en, and also Cockin sometimes. Russell was one of the croupiers. I sometimes played alone, and sometimes with others The bank has a certain number, andthose who play have another number. I back them. When I played alone my los was mucah geater than when others were there. While we were playi refreshments were ha whatever we liked to call for. we were asked to take champagne and other wines. When I lost my money I paid what cashIhad. If Ihadnot enough I gave an I 0 U or a check. These seven checkq were givenfor money lost at play. I gave tbem to the defendant or sent them by post. The total is 6,5251. I drew this check in favour of Wooderoft. because, being a commer. cialrnan, I did not wish my bankers to know that they were oragambling.house. SometimesI ave acceptances. One of these pse minto the hands of Cxlverwell. When I pt Culverwell's case into the hands of my solicitor I was told I had been cheated. Cross-examined by Mr. MAAULAY.-My attorneynow is Mr. Abrahams. Mr. Abrahams acted for me in the action brought against me by CulverwelL Culverwehi sued as endorsee of one of tho bills I had given Adkins. My defence Ws that he (Culverwell) was not the bond fde holder of the bill. The defence was that Culverwell and Adkins were both one. I gave no evidence of false dice having been used At the last trial I stated incorrectly that I was only an assistant to my father. I wish to correct that. I was then a partner. I made the mistake because it was the first time I had been in a witness-box, and I was rather confused. Ilhad pronerty independently of my father. 3r. Cockin kept horses, and used to bet for me occasonally. I may have sid to him, "I have lost to you a good deal of money, and you ought to tell me of something good." I had lost largely at gambling before I went to the Berkeley, When I lost the 8,0001. at the Berkeley I think I had 2001. and paid it. On that occason I stayed much later than anybody else. I did not double my stakes. They always had one stake, 25., but on this occasion we played for 1001. stakes. I was not at that time indebted to a gentleman 1A,0004 which he was pressing me for, and threatening me if I did not pay it. I did not lose 13,000h to a colonel at Manchester at " blind hookey." I had lost a large sum to the cousin of Colonel-. I believe I lost over 10,0001., and I paid half of it down, and gave a note for the difference, which I paid. The balance was outstanding; but I think I was not being pressed for the balance when I went to the Berkeley. I paid it two years after. They did not tbreaten to expose me and go to my father if I did not pay it. My father did not know of it. I have also played at the rooms at Doncaster and Newmarket. I also played at Stockbridge, near Winobester. I Wa3 sying there with some friends. That was three or four years ago. I believe it was last September three years. I have played in private at may ovn house. I have 10 or 12 hunters in Leicestershire. I did not keep acook at 500v. a-year. I had not a French cook. The defendant offered to raise me a loan on my property, and I sent him a low valuation of it. That oas abut two years ago. I am a good player at billiards. I never played a match of above 101. I never said I would play a match with a young man at Brighton for 1,00041 who did not know how well I ould play, and he (the defendant) should be there to see and I would tell him (defendAnt) what o'clock it was. At the Berkeley there were some dice, from which the player chose. I bought counters to play with, and paid for them with an I O U. I did not exchange my residue of counters for cash. I don't recollect that l ever had any counters left. I always played til they were all gone. Some of these checks may have been given for outstanding bills. The cheek of the 23d of May, 1851, for 1,0001., I believe was given for an 1 O U. I have often asked the defendant to hold over my bills. I have received backmy bils when I gave renewals and when I discharged them. I have not kept Eo regular an account of my gaming transactions as of my cotton business - Iwish I had. Whatever bils I bad wbich I have not de' stroyed I havo given to my solicitor. I do not think I havs kept all the biLs which have been discharged by payment, Slnce the action of Culverwell ainst me the Dendaut has returned to me two warrants of attorney and one bil of exchange, because there were actions brought aginst him for them by my solicitor on my behalf. I filed a bill in Chancery inJanuary last. Ctlverwell's sction Was ried in November. Since the bill in Chancery I have had back from the defendant aD the secnrities I knew he ha Sooner than go into court he ave notice that he would give them up. One warrant hd been assigned to Brunett, and there was an Issue to be tried, whether it was not given for money lost at play, and whether Brunelt knew of it. That also was deiered up. On the 4th of August, 1852, I cashed a cheek of the defendant's for 1 165.; and on the 1Ith of April, 1864, one for 1951. He had received 1,2001. for me from Davis. Davis used to pay or receive for me at Tatter- Re-examined by Mfr. JATs,_-I have lost in all to defendant 25,000. The defendant had transferred to Branett a warrant of attorney given to defendant for money lost at p.ay, in order that Brunett might enforce it. The bil in Chancery stated t'nat It was given for money lost at PlaI and an isnue was directed to be tried before Lord Campbel,' to see whether it was so or not. I was prepared to try itand Brunett struck and gave up the warrant. These seven checks have nothing to do with any warrnt of attorney have been cancelled. They are for money lost at hald beyond the securities which had been given t p The party wasa part at "chicken haxardy I pad whathIeost Each player at the game of hazard has aw right to ask for By uror.-I have won at some durinthe night, but Ilnever le tthe house awinner.

Ilhad not always the ame dress Mr. M&cA~unjy, the defendant's counsel, here roses and said the defendant ha already given up all the securities he held to the plaintiff; andie wiAnow wMling to gireupaUl the money which had been paid, as well as the securitie. Lord CA BFLL asked it the dofendspt was willing to consent to a vedict for the sum in the puiculuAs of demand. Hz. T-T ainented i Lorda ome= saaid that f that was so the i arywould find a verdict for tht amount. 3fr. JES said the plainti£ could hLava no objection to that. It wras on the ground that the money had been unfairlywo Wthat tue acion had been brought. Lord CAPsL then told the jury that in dischrg of thedr dut they would find a verdict for the plahitiff for DROOK AND AZOTHI V. ASTON. IMr. Bovill, Q.C., and Kr. Hindmarch appeared for the plaintiffM; and Mr. H. Hi, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty, for the defendant. The plaintiffs in this action, Messr Brook and Hiret, wereo woollen manufacturer, at Hudderafield, in Yorkhire; and the defenda.nt5 W. H. Aaton, was also engaged in the same rnanufactmre at the same tlme. The action was brought to recover damages for the infringement of a patent nranted to the plaintiff on the 23d of Febmary, 16, for an improvement in finishing yarns of wool and* hair, and in the finishing of wooUen fabrics and piece-goods." The defendant, among other .pleas, pleaded that the plaint proceaoo ws not a new invntin,andals&tat hge hanot infrinzged it. It appeared from theplaointiffs pecoifiication,-frlhed in the autumn of last year, that, "This inventon has for its object aniimprovement inl finisng yas of wool or hair, and in the nsh-ng of woven fabrics or piece.goods, and consist ot cauByarns of wool or hair, rhile disteded and kept separat, to be sbjected to the action of rotatory beaters or bunshers, by which such yarns will be burnished or polished on all sides And the invention also condsts of subjecting woven fabics or piewegoods of cotton, linen^ silk, wool, hair, or other.fibre when in an extended state to the ation of rotatoe beaters or burnishers on either or both aides, by which. such woven fabrics or piece- oodswill be buished or polished on their surfaces." After escribing the mode in which the plaintiffs effected their purpose, they climed-"Firstly, the caing yarns of wool, or hair, while distended and kept sepaate to be subjected to the action of rotatory beaers or burishers, whereby the fibre is closed and strengthened, and, the surface effectually polished. Scondly, we claim the subjecting woven fabrics or piece-goods of cotton, linen, silk, rool, hair, or other fibre, when in an extended state, to the action of rotatorybeaters or burnimhera, as hereinL describedi nhereby faoe of the woven fabric or piecegoods isred and polished and Is made soft and silky to handle or touch.' Xt appeared rom the plaintiffs' evidence that soon after the plaintiffs had speifid their invention, in the latter end of 1856 the defendat had applied toethe nakcerofthe nachihe, and sked him to make one for him; but, meeting with a rets on the ground that the invention was patnted, the, defendant said that if he(the maker) would not make him one, somebody else would. Thedefendant then applied to a mtchite-maker named Cliff and beforeloughe was found to have a machine in operation which the plaintiffs witnemes declared to be an exact imitation of the plintiffa'. At the close of the plaintiffs' evidence,. Mr. HILL objected that the plaintif patent was bad, becaue it was a patent for producing the result in reference to hairund wool by meam -of the same machineryaa w patented by them in 1853 in reference to cotton and -linen Lord CAMzPnLL said he would reserve leave to the defendant to move on that point. His Lordship intimated that if the plaintiffl patent was good there wAs good evldenoe of an nfringement. Mr. HLL said he wished to call evidence to show, not only that there had been noinfringement, but that the procsa 1tented by the plaintiffs was not new, but was already well known and in ue before the plaintiffs took out their patent. The defendant was then exarnined, and denied that he had infringed the plIntifre patent. He srdd he had only used his machine in the scouring precess, and that, as he only manufactured " tweeds." which did not require to be "burnished"and"polished,"hehadnoneedonse a polishing machine. He said the machine wrhich he had used was Fnlton'e" scouring machine, paented in 1823, and that he had paid Fulton a llcense of 201. to use his maahine. HIe said he paI. the 20L. to Folton, not because h had b)een threatened, but for "conscience' sa." log beforethe close of thecase th jury said they were unanmousy of opinionthat if the plaintiffs' patent was good there had been an infringement. Lord CAsPBr. said he wa of the same opinion, but wished the tril to proceed. Eventually this defence was abandoneod; and His LonDaiPr in summing up, left it to the jury to say whether or not tle process used by the defendant was substantially that patented by the plaintiffs; if so, the plain. tiffs were entitled to a verdiet. The jury immediately found a verdict for the plaintiffs, vith 40s. damages.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. JUNE 22. AMI}AO. V. MAfrnMAT.TA (Mingo at MVisi Prius, at Westmin?r, beforc Mfr. JTutike CROWDIR and a Snedal Jrurn, Mr. Serjent Bylee, Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Palling were ounsel for the pldntiff; and Mr. Serjeant Shoe and Mr. Peteradorff appead for the defendatt. Mr. PulIcG, in opening the pleading, stated that this was anactionbrought bythe plaintiff to recover from James William Bosfild Maodonald, commonly called the Hon. Janes William Macdonald, damages for alleged criminal conversat'on with the wife of the plaintiff, and that the defendant had pleaded "Not guilty.: Mr. Serieant BYLnS then stated the case for the plaintiff and aidthat he was not there for the purpoee of defending the propriety of such an action as that which was now brought. He had no opinaon upon the matter which was now under discusBon in high legilative quarters, bat that as long as the law of the land admitted of no divorces unless damages had been recoveredaanat the adulterer at the hands ofajury actions of this nature must be brought. Thelearned serjeant then proceeded to say that the plaintlff having practisd for 15 year;s as anattorney in India, had retrned to his native land with a small competency, and had married the lady with whom he now acused the defend. ant of having committed adultery in the month of October, 1847, he being then about 37 and his wife 17 years old; that her husband after the marriage behaved to her in a most generous marner; and that she expressed herself as being grateful to him for his kindness, bnt that for some reason or other which he (tho learned seijeant) was not able to ex. plain she refused steadily to admit him to the usual intercourse between man and wife, or to live with him on terms of connubial intimacy. She, in fact, told him by letter that she would " beg her bread or die first." Mr. Armitage furnished herwith all she asked for while living away from him at Fort Augustus, in Scotland, and sent her even -such articles as a riding-habit, hat, and Mechlin lace veil, and, in fact, behaved to her in all respects as an affectionate husband. Abonttheyear 1851 he lost sight of her, and since found out that she had been in the habit of visiting the defendant, Colonel Macdonald (who is Aide-de-Canp to the Duke of Cambridge), athis chambers, No. 6 C, second floor, Albany, and that he also vsited her at her lodgings; that the inercourse with the defendant had been kept up until the month of March, 1854, when Colonel Macdonald went to the Crimea. " At that eventful period," said the learned serjeant, " many there were who oni the railway platform of the Sonth-Western were taking leave-wives of their hus. bands, mothers of their sons, lovers of their betrothed, with sad and in many cases too trae presentiments that they were going to their graves. Among these was Mr Armitage, who was bent upon seeing off the defendant. She met him on the platform; he took ber up, he folded her in his arms, he kissed her, and as he got into a saloon carriage, in which was his distinguished commanding offlcer, she threw her handkerchief to him into the crriage, and said, ' There, Jemmy-thereis my wadding handkerchief.' In 155 the defendant returned, and the intimacybetweenMrs.Akmitage and him was renewed. She became in the familyway, and in May, 1856, gave birth to a male child." The learned ser. jeant concluded a most eloquent speech by observing th%t he did not seek for heavy damages, and he did not anticipate ignominiously low damages, but that he thought moderate dages would meet the exigency of the case. Mr. Bovirz then caled Colin John Macdonald, who said,-I am clerk to a merchant In LiverpooL Mrs. Armitage is my sister. She was married to the plaintifE at Inverness on the 7ih of October, 1847. All her friends were present and his also. Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Sm-Iam 25. I have five brothersand three sisters. All my brothers we in Australia.

I saw my sisteragain, in 1849, at Inverness. She came from London alone, and I stayed ei&ht or nine months at Fort Augustus. She boarded there ith friends. In 1850 she agreed to go back to her husband. I know she was never without money. She was never badly off for clothes; on the contrary, she was always well dressed. I saw her in 1852; she was living inLondon, under the name of Mrs. Stanley. I met her at the house of Mrs. Pgh. I sawher in 2855; she was somewhere near Brompton, passing by the name of Mr Macdonald. Macdo is her muden name. In re-examination the letters aUuded to in Mr. Serlet Byleds opening were put in and read, and proved to be in their nature and tone such as an affectionate wife would write to her husband, with the exoeption that without a ng any reason for her determination she stated most diat ctfy that she would not live with him.

Mr. Gole appeared for the assignees; Mr. 1Lwrence for the bankrupt. The Court was informed that the bankrupt's accounts showed a trading extending over a period of between two and three yea-s. Commencing virtually withou-t capital, the bankrupt's liabilities were now 27,0001., af wbich 12,}001. would be proofs against the estate. The assets had realized 2501.

' Estimated" was a term usnthis court'which meant somethlng that was intended to mislead. The estate would pay 8s. in the pound, but the bankrupt had not correctly represented his position to creditors, and there would bea suspension of the certificate (second class) three months, with protection. SN li T. WARD. The bankrupt was a stock manufacturer of Bow Churchyard. On the application of Mr. CHm y he passed his examninaliion. (Before Mr. COmmiWsiner FANE.) IN RE BUNNEY. M-. Commisioner FANH delivered judgment on an applieation made by Henry Bunney, solicitor and builder, of Newbury. He said,-The bankrupt has applied to me for leave to surrender under a petition for adjudication of bankruptoy against him issued on the 12th of March 1855, bis excuse for not surrendering before being that he had left England lor NIew Zealand in November, 1853. The circusastances are these:-In November, 1853, he was largely in debt, and, having collected property to a consider. able amount, he started for New Zealand with it, having mmade no provision for the payyment of his debts. No credi. tor proceeded against him till 1855, but on the 12th of March in that year a petition was presented, under which he was adjudged bankrupt, and the usual notice was left at his last place of abode, and his bankruptcy was advertised in the usual manner in the Gaseue. In April the assignees sent out proper forms to enable persons in New Zealand to enforce their rights as assignees against the bankrupt's propesty there, and thus actual notice of the bankruptcy -eached Bonney. Of course, it was Bunney's duty to return and meet his creditors, but instead of so doing he resisted the proceedings of the assignees' agents in New Zealand, and, as they had seized his property, he sued them for the seizure In the New Zealand Court. That Court having decided against him, he has returned to this coun. try to prosecute an apneal to the Privy Council, and, being here he now asks lave to surrender, in order that he mtay clear his eontempt, and thus place himself in a position to prosecute his appeal. I was told that the Court before wich the matter was to come was anxious that no time should he loAs in deciding whetner he Bhoala be permitted to suvrender or not, and as the case of " Ex parite Nairne". (1, Fonblanque's Bankruptjcy Repo-t, 37) was cited to me, in which Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque bad refused to permit the bankrupt to surrender, I at first, and before studying the authorities, expressed an opinion against the banklrupt, but I have since had an opportunity of considering all the cases, which are numerous, and the principles upon which they depend, and I have now no doubt that he ought to be permitted to surrender. It is quite clear that the only effect of permitting a bankrupt to surrender is that by his surrender he will clear his contempt of Court in not surrendering, and be placed in a position to institate or carry on any legal proceedings he may be advised to institute to test the validity of the proceedings against him. His surrender after he has failed to surrender within the legal limit of time cannot possibly affect any criminal proceedings agaiast him inder the penal clauses of the bankrupt law. By the 251st clause of the Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act, 1829, non- surrender within the legal period after notice of bankruptcy properly served makes a bankrupt guilty of felony, ana surrender afterwards, even with the permission of the Court of Bankruptcy, cannot alter his crime. He is still guilty of felony, and if prosecuted must be found guilty and punished, unless the Crown think fit to pardon him In former days, indeed, Chbsellors armed with Imperial power, sometimes intimated that in cases calling for such aets of de6tlqm thev would impound the proeXs under the bankruptcy, and thus stop a prosecution by suppressing evidence, but all those threats applied to stppceed eases of prosecution threatened by assignees or creditors, and have no application to the question before me, which is not whetner this bankrupt shall be prosecuted and punished for felony, but whether he shall be permitted to clear his contemnPt in not surrendering at the proper time by surrender. pag now, and by thus clearing lhis contempt be placed In a postoion for legally prosecuting his app6al to the Privy Council from the Court in New Zealad, course 'which the appelant cannot pursue while in cntept. I am Of opinion that I ought to allow him to clear his contempt, and thus remove his inaeity to sue, and I therefore Permit him to surrender. A careful consideration of all the authorities will I think, show thatl thepricipesabove laid down 'Wili reconcile all, the olWse ncd make the law clear. It has been sometimes said that leave to surrender would not be given if the assignees oh. jected, but this must have been said when ass wer mnere liable to civil1 actions at the sui of na er than they are now, and the refusal to permit sum,aer must have been intended as a colateral mode of protecting assignees * but this point does not arise in this cae, for the assignees have appeared, and do not object to his being permnitted to surrender.

POLICE. MARLBSOROU(H-STREET.-Thomas Laroche, cab driver, was eharged with being drunk and otherwise misconducting himself. Sir Benjamin Hall said that on Saturday last, after leaving his office in Parliament-street, he hailed the defendant's cab at Charing-cross, and desired him to drive to Brookesls Club The defendant drove off at a furious pace, not to Brookes's, but to the Conservative. He set the defendant right, and the defendant drove first on one side of the street and then the other, and finished by driving against another vehicle, and neatly vverturning the cab. Hle then got out of the cab, and fiding that the man was intoxicated he called a constable and gve binm into custody. On public grounds he considered bhat it waq his duty to bring such a case before the Court. The driverdid not deny the charge, but expressed the utmost contrition for what had occurred. Mr. BEADON said the case was a very bad one, and he must therefore puton a fine of 20s. The money was paid. For W.

Upon opening it the defendant Thomas rushed in, followed by his brother, whom hs called, and having knocked the candle out of her hand, one struck her a blow across the head with a poker, and she waa otherwise illtreated by them. Her cries brought down a friend who as upstairs, when he was also furiously attacked. She gave no provocation of any description, and could only account for the attack by supposing that the first-named defendant had an ill-feeling towards her in conseqience of her taking the part of her sister (his wffe), to whom he behavedin the most cruel manner, the poor creature at that moment being literally covered with bruises which he had inflictod. James Carney said he was at the house when the men came, and hearing complainant's cries went down to her assistance. Both defendants then attacked him, and while he was 'wrenching the poker out of the hand of one of his assailants the other inicted a severe blow with a pair of l AnsoLD observed that if the accused were desirous of saying anything they might do so, but the case was !of by far too serious a nature for him to deal with summarily, and he should therefore send it to the sessions for triaL The irst-named defendant said he merely went to inquire for his mwife, who was harboured at the house, when he was attacked bg Mary Anne Lawley.

Each of them must be committed to the lIouse of Correction for three months, with hard labour. On Thursday last 130 of the lads belonging to St. John's Episcopal Chapel Sunday SchooL situated in the London. road, Southwark, were bountifully regaled in Greenwich Park through the kdndness of the minister and congeation, and during their perambulations one of them picked up a purse with money in it, which he at once handed to one of the teachers, who attended this court yesterday to inform his worship of the circumstance, so that by a notice in the newspapers the owner might be found.

PoUce sergeant Alexander Tahourdine, 1 L, deposed that shout 20 minutes past, 10 o'clock on the preceding night he heard a considerable noise at the Obelisk in the St. George'scircus, and on approaching the place found nearly 200 persons assembled. The prisoner at the time was " holding forth" on the benefits of teetotalism, and telling those assembled how well he could keep from drink, and how mach better he was for doing so; but his auditors kept hallooing and hooting him at the top of their voices. Witness, findin the crowd so great that it impeded the progress of the vehicles, went up to the prisoner, who was quite drank. and requested him to leave off his preaching and go about his butsiness. Mr. ELraoTr.-Whatk a man drunk, and preahlng about and recommeading total abstinence!I Witness.-Yes, Sir, he was quite dlrunk. (Loud latightet.) I asked him to go three or four timel but he refused to do so, and continued to abuse me in' the most filthy language, uponwhic I as obliged to call for the assistance of a conablie andakehim the station-house. The rspectable inhabitantfs of the neighbourhood are constantly complaining of the nuisance caused by the different preachers at the Obelisk, and the numerous robberies that take place there through them, and th-re are some of those gentlemen now present to complain to your worsbip. Poiecosale WiUliam Young, 287 A, corroboratedl the greater pert of the statement of the last witness, and said that both before be was taken and on his way to the station. house the piooner had made use of very foul and disgusting language. Mr. ELLUOTr.-Do youthink he was drunk ? Witness.-Decidedly so. (Renewed laughter). Mr. William Harris, the proprietor of the Equestrian Tavern, at the top of the Blackfriars-road, complainedof the nuisance caused by the preacbing, or whatever it might be called, at the place mentioned by the constables. Sometimes there were as many as four or five persons holding forth at the same time, and the shoutiugs and bowlings of the partisans of each, and their abuse of each other, brought disgrace on the neighbourhood. Robberies at this plaoe vwere of very frequent occurrence, and it was eiil_ a few nights before that a customner of his, who had stopped for a few momenta to hear the controversy, had been robbed. On the previousniglit, when returning home, the crowd at this place was so 4reat that he had toturn gut of h Osw TTOavo-I suppose the prisoner b94 been. to your house?

Mr. Solly, a medical gentleman residing in the circus, de.

It refers to an application made by Sir John, 2n January last, for a grant of lOQO1. to provide for the expense entailed upon the colony by the measures of defence required by the crisis in China, and in March his Excellency solleited a farther grant of 1O,COOl. to meet the " extraordinry expenses" of the colony. The Government sooeded to the first request for a grant of 10,0001. (for Hongkong), but declined to comply with the second application (for another 10,0001.) without some more satisfactory explanation of the precise objects to which it was proposed that this further aid should be applied. Sir John Bowring was at the same time (the 9th of May) ordered " to bear steadily in nind that any grant of money made to Hongkong on grounds arisi2g out of the present htostiities with China must-be exclusively applied to that service, and on no aoQoont 4iverted to &olonlai objects If An tx&OIS cha. racter."

The house was left in chrge of an aged woman of 72, who acted as a confidentialhosekeeper and cook. This woman, whose name was wMy White, had previously nut an invitation to her niece,' who reachd the house between 1 and 12 oclook. The niece passed through a back gate in the lane, and hbving entered the back kitohen on the arOd floor she found her aunt with her head nearly severd freen her body, the throat being cut intwo plaes, and the wound extendinb almost from one ear to the other. The body was lyingi a pool of blood, and from the general appeance of the room there wasevidenco of a violent stree having taken place between the miurderer and his victum.

The poLMce then searched the hous It would seem ihat the murderer, after committing the act, mwst have gone to Mr. Smal's bureau in one of the upper rooms and taken from it a hamer and chisel with the aid of which he forced open the whole of the drawers an robbed the place of money, watches, and jewelry. The exact amount of money taken away, or the different articles of j;ewelry stolen, cannot at present be scertained.- The police, wbile (oeecuting their search, found a inie snmecl it bloodt1 a ultbox. and acl knife witha buckhornhdle,raherruaty,inabowl; an itixsuped that failing to accomplish his purpose with the aid of the first-named weapon the murderer bd recour to the second; henoe the two wounds in the throat. The a;asin, after destroying isiB victim, and haring robbed the house, ~must have left by the beck entrance, as can be seen from oertain footmarks on the ground, evidently made b a pir of lightly- mde boo, wlhich were traced from te grounds of the house to HAPI-Ne; and similr impressions on the ground rere traoed almost as far as the railway station,-leaving no doubt that the murderer took the first train after 1 o'clock for London. A telegraphic message was irnmediately despathedtothe polie-station of the H division, at Spitalfidds, deecribing the nature of the offenoe, and giving some aLight description of the suppoa d murderer. The inomentte new rched London, Inspector Gernon and Wakeford, and Sergeant Oliver, No. 21, despatched information of the occur. renoe to the different police ststions of the metropolitAn and city forces, as weeU as to the chief offices in Great Scotland. yard and the Old Jewry. A number of officers were de. xpatched to the Shoreditch terminus of the Eter zou. ties Rallway,but it appear6 that the fellow had s eed, if he alighted at that station, in getting clear aw The man who was seen waiting outitde the house is thu, decribedbythepolice -"Aboutr30 yearsof abg,ft.7in. to 8in. in height, dressed in a white slop with ble stripes, dark brown trousue, and lght Wellington boots." The prevailing impression is that this disguise was only put on to elude the poice, and there is no, doubt entertined that the person, whoever he wst, was well acquainted with the inktrior of the house. No tidings of the assasin have yet been obtained TAst evening Ifr. Lewis, coroner for Esex, held an in. quest at the Dun Cow, Chingford Hatoh, when the foUow. ing evidenoe wa given *- John Smalluaid,-I ama farmer. The deceased as m wife's siter-in-law, and was a siigle woman. She hZ lived with me and my wife over 20 year I last saw her alive on Sunday morning, at 25 minutes to 11, when myself and wife went to church. She was then in the kitchen, where she was found dead. She was in tolerably good health when I left ber,,-bnt had a bruise over one of her eyeg, whioh she did by opening the door in a hurry. I was sent for about half-past l2on Sunday, and when I arrived at home I found my niece and a Mrs. Stafford there, and deceased was quite dead. One of the t knives produced I ideutify as my property ; when I wept to church it was on the meat screen. ft the other kmnif I know nothing. She was the last person in the world likely to conmmit sudide, and when I went to church she was in excellent splrits. Mrs. Emmna Small, of 21, Great Bath-street, Coppioe-roiw, London, said, -On Sundaylst I came down from2ondon for the purpose of seeing the decesed and Mr. and Mrs. SmalL I arrived here at nearly 12 o'clock. I came by myself, and when I reachedthe house I went to the front door, but, not receiving any answer, I went to the back, and found both the back doors partly open. In getting to the back I had to p through two gates, which I found open. On enterngthrough the back door I came to the kitcben door, which was also pary open. I entered tho kitchen and found no one there. I called, but received no answer. I found' the deceased lying at the foot of the stairs her head and shoulders being in the kitchen and he feet on the stairs I was toofrightened to see whether she Ws dead or alive, but, thinking my aunt had fallen in a fit, I ran out and Oalle a woman who was in hergarden, and she came, and, lifting deceased, I found her face covered with bloodj and afterwards a wound in her throat. Ip&rti. culArly no1iced that neither of her hands was bloody. After she was taken upstairs I saw her undressed, and noticed a woand on the left temple, from which blood had flowed. I also saw a wound on the left hip. I cannot say whether the wound had bled but the skin was off. I immediately sent for medicaliad, and3Mr. andfrs. Small, and a policeman, who attended. Selina Stafford said,-I have known the deceased some Years, andl frequently sawher. On Sundsy last EMrs Ema Smalcalled tome and aked me to come withher, as she thoughtheraunt vasina fit. Iwent in and found deceasedon tbefloornear thefoot ofthe star,with her head andshoulders in the hItchen. Upon lifting herbead up I sawthat her throat was cut onboth sides, and she aas quitedead. There wasa great deal of congealed blood in the kitchen, which was covered over with a hearthrug. The blood was a yard or so from where the body was lving. My husband came, aid after some time she was remioved upstairs, and I helped to undress her, ad found a severe wound on the left hiD and another one on the left temple. I live in the next honse but three, but I did not hear any scream, nor did I see any strange man or any other person waiting about the premises. If any scream had proceeded from the house and there was no rIoSse in my house I must have heard it. This knife (a common bnckhorn pocket one) I found in a bowl of soapy WAter inthe sink in the kitchen. I did not detect any blood on the knife, nor yet in the water. The knife was given to Mr. Trivett. Neither of her bands was bloody, bat there was blood on one of her arms, and there was blood on her gown, her chemie, stockings, and boots. I did not search the clothing of deoeased to see what she had about her. Her body seemed stiff when I lifted her. The evidenco of the surgeon who was called in went to prove that the deceased was found in tho kitchen and quite dead She as quite cold. There was a wound across the throat which had severed the trachea. There was also a clean iacised wound on the left temple, and there was a contusedwoundon the left hip, and a severe bruise on the cheek. There was nothing to accoant for deathexoept the loss of blood caused by the injuries. The 'Coroner said that the case was one of great mystery, for inthe middle of the day it was hardly possible to conceive that no one would be moving about. As the cse must be adjourned for a post morem examination, he thought it would be as well to adjourn at once. LATEST PARvTICULAp, The local and metropolitn pOOice are most actively ,engd in ^rsuit of the murderer of Mary White, at Ohingford Hatch- and yesterday several detectives and constables of die H and N divisions of police proceeded to Woodford to pursue their investigations. lt is the genera1 opinion that a very great mista1ke was maade An despatching a telegraphic message to the Spitallields Polce-station instead of acquaintin the various stationmasters along the line, by wbheh mudh time would have been saved, and the captare of the murderer would have been certain, had ho travelled by rail, which is doubtfnL. Many of the officers engaged in the case consider it to be more probable that the murderers-as it is now believed that more than one were engaged in the sang-nary act-walked to a more distant station on the line in order to lull raspiion in the event of a oommunicatio_ by telegraph being made, No suspicion ,Is attached to any person in the vicinity, nor is there any person missing. It was stated late last everng? that the police are in possession of a clue to the murderer' retreat, Yesterday application was made to Sir George Grey, Secretary of State for the Home Department, praying that a Government reward may be offered, in order to stimul'ate the endeavours of the p]olice. Proclaation of a reward is expect'ed to appear in this evening's, Omte.
CBItm iN SconAD.-A blue-book jUBt pUblished gives long tabular statements of crime In Scotland in the year 1856. From the abstract it would appear that the number of persons charged with offences in 1856 exhibits an increase of 2,2863 per cent.; 2,591 males, and 1,122 females were committed, 2,996 tried, 2,762 convicted, outlawed, or found insane, 926 convicted as relapsed or previouily convicted culprits, and three condemned to death. The proportion of convictions to committals was 74-3873 per cent., and the proportion of acquittals to committals 256127 per cent. 1,046 were offences against the person, 380 againsi property with and 1,942 against property without violence, 79 mnaliciokis offences against property, and 85 offenes against the carrency. Offences against the person have increased 7-613 per oent,; offences against property, without violence, li77342 per cent, ; and malicious offenoes against prop rty, 1-282 per cent. Forgery and currency offences have decreased 31451 per cenit. 716 persons (of both sexes) could not read or write, 2,352 could do bothirnperfectly, 5b6 could do both very well, and 81 bad a superior education.

'Three of the crimjinsl3 were sentenced to be ange 72 to be transported, 202 io penal servitude, 2,170 to imprisonment, nine to be flagellated, and 223 to fines. FORGnWG A COU Y COnTS PxsocwSS-A. somewhat singuLar case was heard before the Exeter magistrates afew days *Ro. A respectable tradesman, named WiUiam Downey, of lopsham, was oommitted for trial on a charge of forging the name of Mr. John Daw, registrar of the Exeter Dishict County Court, to an ilegally ooncocted aummons, It was stated that persons travel about the country and make a good living by seUing documents in imitgtion of County Court summonses, which re printed in Holywell-street, London. These are purchased by small tradesmen, who send them to tardy debtors in -order to frighten them into payment. To make the process comn plete it is necessary to forge tho signature of the regittrar. eThi Downey did, and poated the letters in Exeter, so that it might appear to the debtor that they caame from the office of -the re itrar. By the County Courts Act the offenoe is one of felony. It was stated by Mr. Daw that he believed the prisoner did it in ignorance of the consequenoes, but still it Ws a serious offence, and people must be made aware thereof. The magistrates committed Downey for trial at the ensuing Quarter Sessions.
