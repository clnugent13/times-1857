COURT OF EXOE:QUFEA, THIUrSDAY, MAY 2S. -- - HORTON V. BOÃ¯Â¿Â½'.-JVDG3NMp. Witmzna7 in Banco. I =r. .naron ZRAXWELL delivered judgment in this rule, which was argued last term, and raised the questien whether the plaintiff in an action of ejectment was entitled to administer interrogatories to the defendant, who was in possession of the estate the objeet of the action, calculated to elicit the title under which he held. The learned Baron now stated that, having examined all the cases on this point in the equity courts, the Court had come to the conclusion that thero was no precedent or authority for the course proposed by the plaintiff. In consequence the rule, which was to rescind an order of Mr. Justice Coleridge, nust be made absolute. Judgment accordingly. NEW TRIAL PAPER. ltLTS V. THE LOSDON AND SOUTH-WSTEJR RAILWVAY COWOAIiY. This was an action to recover damages from the defendants for the loss of certain colts alleged to have been killed through their negligence. At the trial before Mr. Justice Cresswell, at the last Kingston Assizes, it appeared that the line of the company was carried across an occupation road at a level, in ignorance of the fact that there was also a public right ot footway along the road, in which case the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act requires that the cresung should be accomplished by means of a bridge. The company caused high gates to be erected on either side of their line at the point of crossing, and keys of these gates were delivered to the parties occupying the lands adjacent, among whom was the plaintif. A boy of the piaintiff whose duty it was to drive his cattle backwards and forwards over the crossing, happened to lose his key, and 'he gates having been left consequently open one day, the colts of the plaintiff, which were depasturing in a field adjoining the footway and road, strayed through the gates into the line of the railway, where they were run over and Idlled, on which this action was brought. Under these circumstances the learned judge left it to the jury to say whether the defendants were guilty of any negligence, and, if so, whether the plaintiff was himself contributory to the accident, as, if that were so, he could not recover from the defendants, thoughitmight be that they were guilty of negligence, and had not complied with the requisites of the Act. The jury having found for the defendants upon this direction, this rulefor a new trial was subsequently obtained on the ground of misdirection. 31r.Edwn James, Mr. Lusb, and Mr. Addison appeared to show cause against the rule, which was supported by Mr. M. Chambers, at the conclusion of whose reply, TheUCoRt gave judgment, unanimously affirming the direction of the learnedjudge, and consequently The rule was discharged. THE OXFORD CIRCUIT I%EW TErA. The CHm BARON gave notieo that the Court havingreached the Oxford Circuit new trial and Mr. Heating, the new Solicitor-General, being necessuily absent, the Court would pass over those cases for the present in which that learned gentleman was engaged, and would take those cases which stood lower in the paper. If, however, the aper should be gone through fore the return of the Solicitor-General, the Court would be desirous of takng such of his cases as could be heard in his absence without inconvenience. HIGGINS V. BT OTO,f. With reference to our recent report of this case we are requested to state by the solicitors to the plaintiff that their client had not, as was surmised, had any dealings vwith Mr. Fitzgibbon before tike transaction out of which this. action arose. (Sihrgs at Nisi Prsus, at Westminstcr, before Mr. B&aron CHA?NELL and Common Tur-is.) DAlzIEr V. WirTE. This was an action to recover damages for a breach of promise of marrage. The defendant pleaded that he had notmadeithe promise, as alleged, and that a reasonable time had not elaosed for its e ormance before the commencement of the action. the Edwin James, Q.C., with Mr. Murray, appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Slad Q.C., with another learned gentleman, represented the deeendant. It appeared from the ooening statement of the learned counsel that the pl i leanor Brewster Dalziel, is the daughter of a person who formerly carried on business as a butcher at Sunderland, and the defendant, Alexander Croft White, is at present the master or captain of a vessel trading to St. Petersburg. In the lAtter part of 1855 the defendant, -who was then employed in the coasting trade between Surderland and London, saw the plaintiff at a chapel which she attended at Sunderland, and wrote two or three letters to her, requesting permission to vsit the house of her father. He soon afterwards obtained an introduction to her, and pid his addresses in the u manner ce d Lh her M n hewvas absent oun his voyages. He sumiequently obtained a sitiation in a veseel trading with India, andb when he was at Calcutta wrote a letter viruall breaking off the engagement into which he had entered with out any cause or reasonable excuse. The following enidenoe was called in support of the plain. r-s. El1izabeth Dickson, a married sister of the plaintiff, examinyed by MIr. MuRuy, Wid,-My father lived in Sun. derland in 1855. There were six of us In famil. In November 1855, my sister received a letter from the do. fendsat. Before th receiPt of that letter she had no personal acquaintance with liim. She had b3eai ateacberat a Sunday school. rTbe letter, which wa ed a dated November22, and odefendantsaidin lt thatehainer wvished for a personal acquaintance wit. lliss Dalr.i.1, b,; nowr toolc the liberty ot addseuingh1r5 MbOU.eb

MILITA RY AND NA VAL INTELLIGBNOB. Yesterday a telegraphic despatch was received at Chat. hIL by Colonel E. A. Parker, Commandant of the Royal Marines, directing a detachment of that corps to embark at Sheerness, on board the Agamemnon, 91, for the purpose of fillng up caualties. On receipt of the order the detach- ! ment left Chatham for Sheerness. The new cement mills which have been constructed at Chatham Dockyard having been completed, are now being fitted with their machinery. The mills consist of two build. igs, each 122 feet in length and 35 feot wide, and edoiu the convicts' workshops, which are now completed and occupied by the convicts who follow various trades. The work. shops are 240 feet in length and 30 feet wide, .and provide accommoda'ion for several hundred convicts. Among the other buildings which have been erected at Chatham Dockyard is a large police station, the old one having been taken down to give additional space for the alterations and improvements which are being carried out at that establish. nent. The Vesuvius, 6, paddle sloop, Captain Charles Wise, arlivod at Spithead from Plymouth yesterday evening, and re3nains,with tho Exmouth, 91, screw, Captain Eyres, C.B.; the Colossus, 81, Captain Thompson; the Malacca, 17, Captain Farquhar; the Brisk, 14, Commander Curtes; the Devastation, 6, Commander Marshall; the Rolla, 6, Lieutenant Nelson; the Sealark, 6, Lieutenant Lowther ; the Snake, 4, Commander Commerell; and the Volcano, 2, Master Commander Hockley. The Melville, 72, hospital ship, Commander Trollope, was taken into dock again yesterday at Portsmouth, being still leaky; this is the third time of docking during this outfit. When she will bh ready for the 23d Fasileers, or to go to China, at this rate, no one can foresee. The news of the loss of Her Majesty's fine o0-gun sailing frigate Raleigh, under the command of Commodore the Hon. H. Keppel,was legraphedto Portseayesterdayafter noon, and on its dissemination caused the saddest excite meat; she wa3 a zoble ship, and most admirably officered ansi,vanned; she was commissioned on the 17th of September last as the senior officer's ship for the India station. The freight ship Euphrates has been taken up by Govern mnent to ship 14 tons of ammunition from the Ordnance stores at Woolwich for Algoa Bay. The hired screw steam troopship Mauritius, at Deptford, is having her storeroom filled with artillery supplies from Woolwich for Hongkong; and the Runnymede freightship, of heavy tonnage, also at Deptford, Is embarking a similar cargo for the same destination. The guns, shot, shell, and other heavy portions of the cargoes are hoisted into a number of barges alongside the wharves at Woolwich Arsenal by the hydraulic cranes, and are conveyed up the river for shipment on board at Deptford, whero the vessels are taking in victualling stores for the army and navy in China. The freight-ship Fortitude, in the London Docks, is also embarking Ordnance supplies for Ceylon. The Earl of Mar and Kellie freight-ship, having completed her cargo of engineering implements, with 310 tons of Tower and victualling stores, &c., for Hongkong, is to sail to-dayfrom Woolwichi. The Ordnance sloop Somerset has arrived at Woolwich, and commenced discharging her cargo, which consists of gunPs and general war stores from Portsmouth. The screw steamer Balaklava, Captain William Pellatt, in the special service of the Military Store Department of Woolwicb, arrived there yesterday morning laden with 50 carronades from Portsmouth, and 400 tons of returned war stores, bedding, clothing, &c., from the East. She made-a rematkably quick passage from Portsmouth to Woolwichnamely, in2212 hours.
THB CRBAND DUKE CONSTANTINE OFRUSSIA PORTSMOUTH, TnUPRSDAY. It maysave the sight-seekinig public, who avail themselves of railway accommiodation in these " excursion-train " days to rush anywhere in search of the lion of the hour, some truable and disappointment to know that the visit of the Imperial Prince, who is the Lord High Admiral of the Russiau navy, and brother to the Emperor of Russia, is, as far as at present imparted to " authority," i3r.ended to be one of friendly courtesy to the Qucen alone, divested of any show or state, and wvhether it will extend beyond the precincts of the Marine Palace of Osborne is more than problematical. No " preparat ons" wbatever are being made at this dockyard and dependencies in expectancy of a viait frora the Prince-Admiral, but should he pay one he wiU find everything in its daily state. There wiU not even be the anticipated general Royal salute by the squadron at present at Spithead and in barbour on the arrival of the Duke with his f' ig flying at the main of the Admiralty State yacht Osborne; for, according to P. tetlgrapbic message received this noon by Admiral Sir George Seymour, K.C.B., the Commander-in-Chief, from Captain Seymour, on board the Osborne at Cherbourg, the yacht will steam through the Needles passage instead of through Spithead. The Admiralty yacht will leave Cherbourg so as to arrive at Osborne about 3 p.m. on Saturday; and, in order tha'l er Majesty may have the first intimation of the appearance of the Osborne in sight, a signal-officer has been posted by the Royal commnand at Hurst-castle to telegraph the fact, and the 3Enrydice, 26 gun sailing corvette, Captain Tarleton, C.B., will do the honours of salutiDg, manning yards, &c., on the yacht nearing Osborne. Hcr najesty's steam yacht Victoria and Albert, Captain the Ron. Joseph Denman, has been re-embellished, and goes down to Osborne to-morrow morning to attend upan the Queen; it being deemed just possible Her Majesty may take her gaUant visitor a cruise through Spithead before leaving. The grenadier company of the 93d Highlanders (splendid stalwart fellows), comuianded by Captain W. G. A. Middleton, with Lieutenants Butter and Wood, with their fine band, went over to Cowes this afternoon in the steam-tug Pigmy to form a guard of honour to the Duke on his landing on Osoorne beach. sirGeorgeSeymour wentdownto Osborne yesterday to pay his respects to Her Majesty on hoistir-g his new flag, but did not receive any commands from Her MaJesty relative to the reception of the Grand Duke beyond the desire to hpve a ship stationed off Osborne to salute, &a., during his sojourn, which is not expeted to be a lengthy one. None of the Prince-Admiral's own squadron will come to this port on the occasion. The Russian Ambas. aador is expected at Portsmouth this evening or tomorrow.
AN- ADMirETED ANERICAN DEFICIENCY.-If there is any one faculty in which we Americans value ourselves it is our inventive genius, and if our claims to distinction on this score were disputed we should very naturally turn with confidence to that stately edifice at our national capital, the Patent-office, in which so many evidences of our fertility in inventions are kept for inspection. We could point to the cotton gin, the ilprovements in the printing press, the electric telegraph, and to innumerable labour. saving maehines, many of which are in extensive use in the Old World. We have proved ourselves eqaal to every emergency in which we have been placed, and we may, without subjecting ou-selves to a charge of vanity, boast that on the whole we are an improvement on the Old World. But we have our weak point. There is one most essential quality in anewnationwhichwe do not possess, or, if wedo possessit,we do not exercise it, We can overcome time and space by our inventions, but we lack the genius to invent new and significant names for the towas we are continually founding and building. We are depcndent on the Old World for our nomenclatuire, and subject ourselves to great inconveniences by repeating the same names over and over. In our magnificent new territories, where all is as fresh to our hands as the earth was when Adam first went forth from the garden of Eden, without any local legends or associations attached to the soot where we begin our settlemuents, a most ftvourable opportunity is presented for the exercise of our inventive faculties in bestowing names. Bat the effort re(quired is too great; the pioreers who ge into the wilderness to make farms and build new cities have too much serious work upon their hands to be able to afford tispe to invent names, and they take the first one that comes toVmnnd, probably the name of the town which the founder emigrated from, and bestow that upon the new city; or the proprietor pays hinmself the compliment of bestowing his own name upon his settlement, anid it is accordingly called Brownsville, TompkinsviUe, M'Grawlersville, as the case may be. We have received from some friend at the West a map of the "Railroad system of Milwaukee," which exhibits to great advantage the splendid resources of that growing town; but the map exhibits the usual poverty of 2nvention peculiar to the West. Milr7aukee itself is a beautifal name, and when it is mentioned no one has any confusion of ideas or doubt as to what the place is and where it is situated. But one of the wards from Milwaukee terminates at Ashland; the only place of that name whicb Aimericans ought to know has been endeared to them as the residence of the great statesman who bestowed it upon his homestead. A'aother road terminates at Savannah, on the Mississipi. and another at Hudson. There are also stoppingplaces atBerlin, at Ripon, at Genoa, and Dunleith. Bat there are more good original names on this map, notwithstanding there are so many foreign ones, than we find on the maps of our new States generally. In Minnesota, we observe, they have already a Saratoga and a Florence, and the new towns will all have old names as fast as they are founded. We do not know how this bad systeac of nomenclature can he rectified, unless it is by laughing it out of countenance, or by exposing its inconveniences and absurdities until our countrymen become sensible of the impropriety of bestowing old names upn new settlements. t 10 in violation of the Scriptural rule of putting new wine into new bottles; and there ought to be enough national pride among us to save us from this eternal repetition of the nomenclature of the Old World. The greatest sinners in this matter were the Pilgrim Fathers, but thoy tinned on principle. They called their new country New :England, and with entire propriety brought all their names with them, as they did their religion, manners, and laws; bhLt to do them strict justice it must he admitted that where they found a good musical Indian name they preserved it; and all the names they borrowed were strictly English. There are but few vilies or burgs in New England. -1ew Yeork Tines.

ROYAL ITALIAN OP1ETRA. eth Milt of Mademoiselle Victoire Balfe, which had been so long a topic of conversation in the operatic world, took place last night in presence of a brilliant and orowded audience. The part selected for the occasion was Amina, in Bellini's Sonsna mba, and we may at once say that the huccess of the young aspirant was as complete as her sin cerest well-wishers could have anticipated or desired. That more than usual interest would be attached at such a mnoment to the daughter of one so universally popular in his partioular sphere as Mr. Balfe- composer of the Bohemaian Girl and at least a dozen other operas which have been stamped with the approving verdict of the English public-was natural enough. But, added to this, her youth, her extremely prepossessing appearance, and the knowledge that she had never before trod the boards, were all in Mademoisele Balfe's favour, and tended to raise the cuxiosity and increase the sympathy of the audience Rarely, indeed, has a beginner made her first essay under more auspicious circumstances, and rarely has more frequent and unanimous applause rewarded the efforts of a performer. It was easy to perceive from the outset that no doubt wbatever was entertained about the result; and the hearty cheering which greeted the Amina of the evening as she tripped lightly on the stageto receive the congratulations of her friends on the morning of her approaching nuptials testified to the fact of the whole house being of one nind, This enthusiastic welcome a little disconcertedhMademoiselle Balfe, and evidently rendered her nervous during the opening recitative, " Care compagne," the address to Theresa, " A te, diletta, tenera madre," and the slow movements of the cavatina, " Come per me sereno," all of which she delivered with a certain amount of trepidation; but in the last movement, " Sovra iI sen la man mi pose," baving conquered her emotion, she speedily convinced her hearers that a singer of no ordinary accom. plishment was before them, and the termination was followed by genuine manifestations of approvaL The duet vwith Elvino (Signor Gardoni), in which the wedding ring is presented, confirmed thiz good impresLion; and in the parting scene with her lover, where the doting swain avows his jealousy of everybody and everything, Mademoiselle Balfe displayed so much feehng, and in eo touching and natural a. manner, that the fact of her possessing histrionic as well as vocal power was at once established. The second act (or rather the second part of the first), in which Amina, the sleep-walker, unconsciously enters the bedroom of the Count (Signor Ronconi), was equally successfulalthough here, of course, the dramatic exigencies are far greater, and a complete forgetfulness of herself in the scene she is portraying could hardly be expected from so young a novice. There were, however, ease, grace, and earneEtness In all that Mademoiselle Balfe did; ..nd when to these are added (by the aid of time and experience) the passion and intensity appropriate to the situation, there wil be little or nothing wanting. In the last act,vhich, more than all the rest, tries the qualificatiors of a vocalist, taxing in an eaual measure her art, her sentirnent, and her physicaf resources-Mademoiselle Balfe distinguished herself highly. The beautiful slow movement, "Ah ! non credea mirarti," was delivered with affecting tenderness; and the famous rondo, " Ah non giunge," with the utmost spirit and brilliancy. Objection might perhaps be made to certain ornaments and changes in the latter, as somewhat too elaborated and daring for the present capabilities of the singeror rather for her present command of them when before the piblic; but the audience, unanimously pleased, detected nothing of the sort, or, at least, were wholly disinclined to criticism. The faU of the curtain was the signal for hearty and reiterated applause from all parts of the theatre, and a triple recall, accompanied with bouquets, for Mademoiselle Balfe, Who had already been twice summoned, after the first and second scenes of the opera, and thus consummated her victory. We have, as briefly as possible, recorded the fact of Mademoiselle Balfe's success, the incidents connected with it, and the unmistakeable feeling of the house. At present it is not our wish to enter into detailed criticisms, either aboat the quality of her voice (a pure soprano, "veiled" as tthe term goes), or her artistic capadty in its variol's bearings, musical and dramatic. Enough that we cannot remember a firAt appearance upon any stage hailed with such unequivocal approbation, as~ that the general impression produced upon the audience was that they were both seeing and bearing son. ething young, fresh, and, in its way, individu=. Let hMaoemoiseile Balfe, then, sleep upon her triumph, andnot intoxicated by the plaudits that c. owned her efforts throughout the night-endeavour to put it to the best use by striving her utmost to show the public that its generous welcome was accorded to one thoroughly resolved to deserve it,
WILLIS'S ROOMS. Yesterday afternoon Signor Volpe commenced his Italian readings with his own XlS. tragedy, eutitledLa dejli Tradita .Asnadei. As might be supposed from the title, the subject of the piece is the old anecdote to which the lorentines trace the Guelph and Ghibelline disturbances of their republic. Buondelmonte, being about to contract matrimony vnith a daughter of the Amadei, broke off the match oa ac ount of a sudden passion for the daughter of Madonna Dosati, and for this affront was nmurdered by the Amadei, and their adherents. Such is the story told by Mac chiavelli, repeated by the late Mr. Rogers in his Italy, and illustrated this year by a picture in one of the Water Colour Galleries. In giving dramatic form to this subject Signor Volpe has represented Mosca Lamberti, one of the murderers of Buondelmonte, as enamoured of Cecilia Donati, and thus jealousy is added to the desire of vengeance as a motive for the fatal deed. The heroine is not Cecilia Donati, the Helen of the Florentines, nor her mother, the artful Madonna, who dazzled Bnona delimonta, with the fatal charms of her child, but the deserted Beatrice Degli Amadei, whose sorrows are elab(rately pourtrayed, and who, when the vengeance is accomplished, fals senseless on the body of her faithless lover. Signor Volpe has a musical voice, and reads with a great deal of eloquence and feeling. Not expecting his patrons to follow him without any assistance, he furnishes them with a printed paper, in which the action of every scene iB described in English, so that, if the words are but iueperfoctly apprehended, the sentiments expressed can be tolerably well conjectured. While Signor Volpe was lecturing in one of the small rooms on the ground 'door of Willis's Mr. William Russell occupied the large room on the first floor, where he most successfullydelivered the second chapter of his personal narrative to a numerous assembly.
THE NEW COURT OF PROBATB. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I trust the remarks of "Scrutator" on this subject which appeared in your journal a few days ago wil meet with the attention they deserve. There is no doubt that the interest of the public rovenue and the character of the district registrars are involved in the question he raises. There are, however, palpable remedies for the evils he justly apprehends, and it is only surprising that they were overlooked by those who prepared the BilL In the Irish courts of probate the executor or administrator is required to specify the property of the deceased in a schedule annexed to the affidavit of property. If the same requirement were made in the new courts this would afford one check. But I cannot see any suffient reason why the now recognized principle of paying by salary rather than by fees is to be departed from in the case of the district registrars -the arguments used by the LordChanceUorinfavourof the departure would apply with equal force to the central registrars. By a careful reference to the numerous returns made by the Diocesan and other courts, an approximate estimate might easily be made of the number of representations which would probably issue from the district registries, and the salaries fixed accordingly this would not only afford another check, but be more consistent with the general spirit of the Bill. While on the suWeot allow me to suggest a further point, which,on sound principles, must, I think, be admitted to be both objectionable and uncaUed for-I allude to the Bill giving testamentary jurisdiction to the County Courts where the effects are under 2001. As the Bill stands at preBent, the testamentary business in the central and district registries would be carried on by officers experienced in that branch of the law, and the establishment of district registries affords every local facility to the public; but to the judges and clerks of the County Courts both the principles and details of practice would be entirely new, and I do not apprehend that they are provided with any places where original wiUs could safely be deposited. Those who are conversant with this branch of practice are well aware that as a general rule a greater amount of experience and more practical discretion are often required in the consideration of wills where the property is small than in those of large amount, from the imperfect and irregular manner in wvhich the wills of poor persons are generally drawn and executed; and yet this description of business is by the BiU to be placed in the hands of functionaries wholly inexperienced in such matters I Added to which, the number of places for the deposit of wills is thereby unnecessarily multplied, and a complex machinery introduced, which only tend to produce perplexity and trouble to the public, from not knowing whether they ought to resort to the County Court or the district registry; besides which it would be opening the door to fraud, as there is notbing to prevent conflicting grants of representation being obtained from the different authorities. I cannot but hope that if the public benefit is to be consulted this obnoxious provision will be thrown out in committee, with some other hardly less important matters of detail which at present tend to mar the integrity of the measure; and thore would then be a reasonable prospect of this much-vexed question being at length satisfactorily settled. VERITAS. The Cologne Choral Society will give their last evening ooncert on Thurbday evening next at Exeter hall.
UNI7ERSITY INT3LIGEN4CR. OXFORD. MvY 2R. In a Congregation held this day at 2 o'clock a series of 11 statutes, connected wita certain trusts which have taken effect for more than 50 years (drawn up in accordance with powers obtained under clause 30 of the Oxford University Act), were promulgated. Afterthe fiwt gtatute of the series, which concerned tLe Craven Scholarships, had been read. the Vice-Principal of St. Mary Hall (M1r. Chase) rose, and readfrom a written doonment his objections to the scheme, which (as he complained) entirely put asidetho qualification of poverty. The Provest of Oriel (Dr. Hawkins) concurred generally with the view of Mr. Chase, and thought that if the Commissioners refused to allow the claims of poverty, the Umnversity should leave the Craven statutes unaltered. The second statute of the series, concerning the Sedleian Reader, was then read. The President of Magdalen (Dr. Bulley) objected to the alteration by which the Heads of All Souls and Magdalen would only vote at alternate elections instead of being permanent members of the Electoral Board. He presumed this was in consequence of the Head of Queen's einL added. The Provost of Queen's (Dr. Thomson) said teat it had originally been settled that no Head of a CoVlege should have a vote for a Professor who was to be a member of another society. The Master of Balliol (Dr. Scott), on the part of the Council, explaiDed that the wish had been to retain aU the members of the old Board, maldng certain additions, but the Council had yielded to the wish of the Comnissioners. Dr. Pusey explained more fully the history of the transaotion. Mr. Eawlinson, of Exeter, rose on a different point. He objected to the clause allowina Professors to hold praelectorships in colleges, if aUowed by a decree of Convocation. Such decrees were obtained by personal influence, which some professors would possess while others would not. The result would be unfairness. The clause was not in the statute previously sanctioned by the University. He would move its omission. The Master of Pembroke (Dr. Jeune) remarked that Mr. Rawlinson's object would be met by the clause in question beinr made the subject of a separate vote. The Provost of Oriel asked why the clauses requiring professors to be members of the Church of England were given up. The Master of Pembroke explained that the Commissioners refused to allow of any new restrictions. All restrictions existing at present on the statuttes of the several foundations deals witha were proposed to .be retained. The rector of Exeter observed that if the University had power ts make new restrictions, it could be done by an ordinary statute. The statutes now under discussion were peculiar. They required the consent of the commisBioners. The Professor of Ltin (Mr. Conin.ton) objected to the omission of any mention of the derivation of a portion of the professor's endowment fiom Queen's College, which would have explained introduotion of the H. of Queen's into the Electoral Board. After a few more words from Dr. Jeune, Mr. Mansel, and Dr. Thomson, the debate upon this statute closed. On the third statute (concerning the professorship of AngloSaxon) being read Mr. Eawlinson observed that he bad the same objection to a clause i it vwhich he had urged to the last. He desired to knowv whether he might understand the observation of Dr. Jeune as a pledge that the Council vould make th clause the subject of a separate oteo? Dr. Jeune said that the Council would do so. The Registrar then read the 93tatute on the Moral Philosophy Professorship. Professor Conington objected to the introduction of the Margaret Professor into the Electoral Board. He did not see why a Divinity Professor should have been added, or why the RWegius Professor should have been passed by. The Junior Proctor was opposed to aU unnecessary changes, and desired the retention of the existing Board. Mr. Mansel observed that the Margaret Pro. fessor was added as some compensation for the omission of the clause requiring the Professor to be a member of the Church of England. He was selected rather than the Regins Professor, because his appointment was by the University and not by the Governt ent. Three statutes (on the Laudiain Professorship of Arabic, on the Keepership of the Ashmolean Museum, and on the Museum itself) were promulgated without comment.i A debate followed on the statutes touching the Professorships of Anatomy, which it is propo-ed to sever from the Regius Professorship of Medicine. Mr. Johnson (the Radcliffe Observer) disapproved the pro. posed change, objeoting to the diminution of the Regiui lrofessor's income, to the swampmg of the endowments o: Dr. Aldrich and Air. Tomlins-the last scarce 50 year, old-and to the appointment of a Demonstrator by the Physiological Professor. Dr. Jeune explained that the diminution would be only 701. per annum, as the loss of the Aldrichian Professorship of Anatomy was to be compensated by the addition of the AIdrichian Professorship of Medicine, Dr. Acland replied to Mr. Johnson at length He regarded the pecuniary part of the matter as very unimportant. The great thing was to put medical education in Oxford on a right footing. This was now in course of being done by the help of the new museum, and of the pro. posed arrangemient, which is regarded as a step in the right direction. It was impossible for a practising phyeician t, discharge satisfactorily the duties of a professor of an%tomy, He thought it very important that the new Professor of Physiology should appoint his own assistants. The statute concerning the Margaret Professorship was thea read. Mr. Gorden, of Christ Church, would move the substitution of the words "Baccalaurei et Doctores" for ' *raduati" in the clause determining the Electors, as it might be doubtful whether Bachelors were graduates. Drs. Jeine andl Scott thought the word graduates would cer tainly include Bachelors. On the reading of the next statute (concerning the Savilian Professors), Mr. 3onington and Dr. Hawkins asked some questions which were assswered by Dr. Scott. The last statute (on the Bampton Lectureship) was then read, when the Margaret Professor (Dr. Heurtley) rose and proposed the entire withdrawal of the statute. All change was inconvenient, and there were special objections to changes infoundationsand endowments. An endowment was a compact and could only be rightly altered when usage had established a departure from the terms of it, or when great inconvenience arose from maintaining them. The present case did not come under eitber head. The changes proposed were reckless innovations. The Professor proceeded to argue against alterations in the subjects of the lectures, which could only be by the exclusion of certain subjects, ared against the power of changing the place of their delivery, which was (he supposed) to banish them from the Universiiy pulpit. The Provost of Oliel concurred in the views expressed by Dr. Heurtley, and would move " that no change be made in the place or subjects of the lectures." Mr. Lake, of Balliol, foilowed on the same side, remarking that the Bampton Lectures formed the only course of dogmatic theology which the University offered to its junior students, and that if the changes proposed were a part of some scheme affecting the general character of the Uni ersity sermons, the whole scheme should be lid before the Congregation at once. Hewished to know why, when so much was to be changed, no power was taken to alter the board of electors. The Master of Balliol said that the object ons urged arose from misa prehension. No power to diminish the subjects of the lectures was given by the statute, but only power to enlarge them. With respect to the place, it was not determined by Canon Bampton's will that they should be preached in the University pulpit but "in the Church of St. Mary's." This might non always be convenient, and indeed it had been departed from, but illegally, in 1856. It should also be borne in mird that the statute made no change. It only allowed he University if it chose, to make changes. The Principal 'f Brasenose replied to Mr. Lake's question, that it had I ecn proposed by the Council to take power to change the Electoral Board, but this proposal had been rejected by the Commissioners. Mr. Rawliuson, of Exeter, thought the e:planations quite satisfactory, except in one point. There v as en ambiguity in the clause with respect to the subjects of the lectures, which the introduction of a few words would *emove. HIe suggested a slight alteration, The proceedings then terminated. An important statute will be promulgated on Friday, June 5, connected with middle-class education.

MEBETING OF THE COHABTY ORILDREN I AT ST. PAUL'& This highly interesting event was celebrated yesterday before a vvat multitude in the nave of St. Paul's CathedraL AlU fears about the dissolution of the Sodety of Patrons, and the contingent abolition of their very impressive animal ceremony, are now, we understand, at an end. Every inhabitant of London who feds a just pride in Its wealth and magnificence must rejoice at such a result. It would be neither more nor less than a lasting shame if the meetings of the charity schools were permitted to languiabh and mltimately expire from a want of that support which our mercbante, to say nothing of our aristocrats, are so well able to give, but which, nevertheless, it must bo owned, theyhave been hithertoveryniggardlyinbestowing. London is not only the largest and most important but the most charitable city of the world; and yet here we find an instance of unaccountable apathywhere the virtue of charity might be practised without ostentation, and where, too, the exerciEe of benevolence is rewarded by a sight unparalleled in its kind, the contemplation of which can never fail to raise the strongest emotions. The indifference of the public-we mean the wealthy public-to the annual ceremony at St. Paul's Cathedr4l, the objects for which it was instituted and on behalf of which it is continued, can only be explained by the fact that these objects are very little known. We ventured to hint so much last year, when the meeting was more successful in a pecuniary point of view than the year previous; and it is as well-since the cause deserves our warmest advocacy-to return to the subject. Upon whom the responsibility devolves we are unable to say ; but it is certain that only a very small portion of the community is fully alive to the great good that might be accomplished were the children's festivals as munificently upheld by the richer as they are eagerly attended by the lss opuleng classes. There are 56 free schools in the metropolis; and after the expenses of the celebration are defrayed, whatever remains out of the receipts and donations is distributedapplication having been made to the Society of Patronsamong the needier of them. Such istitutions as those at Bethnal-green, Bermondsey, Whitechapel, &o.-which are but poorly endowed-might, we repeat, derive substantial benefit from the festivals were the public to exert a little more liberality on their behalf. Bat the expenses are inevitably considerable; and if from a congre gatMon of many thousands of persons the utmost obtainable is something between 4001. or 500W, it may be easily imagined that not much can remain tobe applied to the end in view. The receipts lesterday (without including the collection made at the doors after service-which seldom amounts to more than a moderate sum) did not exceed4401. Last year they reached nearly 4701., and yet the present meeting was far more numerously attended thanitsprecursor. A plain and earnest appeal should bemade at once, to exdt public curiosity and enlist public sympathy, unless the Society of Patrons are content that the anniversary gathering should be perpetuated on an imposing, but wholly unprofitable celebration. The ceremony itself is too familiar to demand a fresh de. scription. Every one, as we have said, comes to see and bear the children, and the first view of these 6,000 little scions of humanity, packed together closely and symmetrically, row above row, until their heads seem to touch the roof of the temple, is as unique and striking as the first sound of their combined voices, in unison, is enthralling. No wonder that Haydn, and, half a century later, X.Hector Berlioz-men with nothing in common but theirenthusiasm -should have been equally filled with wonder and delight at the unexampled effect of the 100th psalm thus delivered _ " a new musical sensation," as they both decared it to be. The musical part of the service, both as regards the children and the united choirs, remaining precisely the same as last year and the year before, we have nothing to remark on that head, except to reiterate our surprise that the gentlemen of the choirs, who are aU musicians, shouald be so listless or so unminadful of the solemnity of the event as to adhere with pertinaeity to music in many respects of a very inferior character. The " Te Deum" and "Jubilate " of Dr. Boyce might surely be discarded for once in seven years, and the chant of Jones be consigned altogether to oblivion. To replace these common. place effusions by something worthier is, we cannot help thinking, a positive duty, if the choirs do not wish to bave their share in the musical part of the service unanimously set down as insignificant. In respect to the children the case is different. To teach them anything new, especially in conjunction with the choir, would be an arduous if not a fruitless task, and while we may suggest that the " Hallelujah" from the Messiah would go all the steadier if the time was not dragged so much (for which Mr. Bates, the conductor, who trains the children with such commendable perseverance, is answerable), we are villing to admit that it would be auestionable policy to substitute another anthem for Handel's " Zadok the Priest," notwithstanding that this was composed in honour of an event (the coronation of George JI.) about which the present generation does.not care a straw. To change the psalms might be easier; but this is only desirable in the case of the 113th (which precedes the sermon), a meander. ing and unrhythmical tune; the 100th psalm (before prayers) could not be spared; while the 104th (after the sermon) is so fine a melody that few would wish to see it laid aside for another. The dnging of the children was better than we ever remember to have heard. Their share in the "HallelUjah" chorus was the only point open to anin,rdversion-and this for reasons specified above. The ' Gloria Patri," in response to the reading psalms (chanted by the members of the choirs) was truly magnificent; the 100th Psalm, " All people that on earth do dwell," went, as usual, to perfection; and a very sensible advance was noted both in the 113th and 104th. In Handel's anthem, " Zadok the Priest," those passages strengthened by the voices of the children in unison,-" God save the King," " Long live the King," "IMay the King live for ever"-produced an effect which, without exaggeration, may be denominated sublime, and engendered a feeling of regret that such a multitude of voices, young, fresh, and sonorous, could not be still more variously and ingeniously employed in the service of music. The number of trampets employed to support and assist the organ were four (there were only two last year)-Mers. T. Harper, Irwin, Macfarlane, and Ward, who performed their duties admirably. It has been argued that cornets would be more useful than trumpets for such a labour, in consequence of the former being easier to play, and the notes more sure of instantaneous production; butwhat might posaibly be gained incertain respects wouldby no means make up for the loss of that penetrating quality which carries the tones of the trumnet to the furthest ex. tremities of the cathedral, and which the cornet, a comparatively vulgar instrument, can in no sense boast. Mr. Chipp was at the drumz. We have often had to compliment Mr. Goss, the able and intelligent organist of St. Paurs Cathe. dral, upon his zealous and sucesssful exertions at these important ceremonies, but on no occasion has that gentleman (in conjonction with his talented assistants Mr. George Cooper) been entitled to more unqualified praise. The prayers were intoned by the Rev. Mr. Shute, and the lessons read by the Rlev. W. J. Hall, both minor canons. The text of the sermon, preached by the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of London, was from Mark, chap. 10, verses 13 to 16 inclusive. And they brought young children to Hmm, that He should touCh them; and His disciple, rebuxed these that brought them. * Aud when JdanD saw it. He wan much diapleseed * ad said mmub them; suffer thelitwe ehtidxen to come unto me, and forbid them not for of such i, the kisedem or God. - Verily I ay nato you Whosoever shaul outreceive the kingdom of Gcd an a little eblid, he shall not enter therein. "- And Hletook them no in His arm,. put hsnds noon them, and bleosed them ." To the greater part of the assembly the discourse (stated to be ezXmporc) was inaudible; but those who were in a condition to catch the words of the right rev. preacher saoke of it in the highest terms. Among the congregation were the Lord Mayor, Sheriff.s Keats and Mechi, Alderman Challis, &c. The Dachess of Sutherland was also present. On the whole this meeting has insuired every one interested in the welfare of the charity schools, and-impressed with a conviction of how much genuine good may still be effected by making the objects of the gathering more widely public, and thus inviting a larger ebare of encouragement-with flattering hopes for the future. Fe earnestly desire they may be realized.

PTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, THURSDAY, MAY 28. PREACING IN EXETETALL Lord DUNGANNON maid, he wished to put & qetedion on a subject of very great importance to the right rev, prelate who presided over the diocess of London. A paragraph had appeared in the public papers which stated that certain evening discourses were being delivered in Exeter.hall on successive Sunday evenings by right rev. prtlates and other dignitariew of the church of England, and that the first of these services began on Sundsy evening lst So0me persons were of opmion that this was noS for the interests of the church, and that it was calculated to introduce a sort of Spurgeonism into the church of England. That hall was very much used for public meetings, but he was not aware that it had ever been consecrated or set apart for Divine worship. The case was a new and singular one, and he must say such as he had never heard of before in connexion with our church. He should be glad to hear from the right rev. prelate whether these meetiDgs take place with his sanction, and whether they are in strict conformity with tho practice and discplino of tho church. No doubt the right rev. prelate was better informed on such matters than he could possibly be; but, considering that these things take place in an unconsecrated building, ho could not help calling his attention to them, and shoild wait for his reply with some anxiety. The question he had to put was whether these proceedings had the approval of the right rev. prelate, and whether he considered them to be strictly in conformity with the rules and discLpline of the church7 The Bishop of LONDON.-I am not awaro thatthe noblo lord is exactly in order in putting this question (hear, hear), but at the same time I am quite ready to give whatever information is in my power to the noble lord. I may state to the Etouse thatl bolieve there is no doubt whatever that such a meeting3as be has described did take place in Exeter-hal last Sunday evening, and also thAt it is the intention that such meetings shal be continuedfor several uc. cessive Sundays. (Hear.) Inam not aware what paragraphs the noble lord alludes to as having appeared in the newspapers on this subject, and there fore it is imposible for me to say how far the statements in those paragraphs are or are not strictly in accordance withfact. (Hear, hear). Imust say, however, that I believe the request which was made to me, that twO right rev. prelates of the church, two learned deans, and several other clergy should on successive Sunday eveningg address the assembled people in Exeter.bali, is strictly in accordance with the Act which I hold in my hand, and which is entitled " An Act for the better securing of the liberty of religious worship," (hear, hear), in 'which it is provided that among the cases in which such addresses may be made are meetings similar to those now taking place in Exeter-halL (Hear, hear.) The Act provides that convocations or assemblies for religious worship held in any building or place not consecrated for religious worship are legal. That Bill was brought in by my noble friend (the Ear of Shaftesbury), and it was the very intention of the Bill that such addresses and such meetings as the noble lord has referred to should be allowed. (Hear, hear.) I wiU also, if permitted, state that not only do I consider these meetings to be strictly legal but in the highest degree expedient. (Hear, hear.) I believe from my heart, that there are thousands upon thousands of people in this metropolis and other large towns, of whose condition your lordships are pained to hear, who have not entered a place of worship for many years. I believe that some such persons were present at the meeting to which the noble lord has alluded, and I fondly trust they were not brought there without receiving benefit. (Hear, hear.) I believe that those who are conducting these meetings have most earnestly at heart the welfare of the labouri3g classes of this country, and there is every reason to hope that by bringing those classes where they Wi hear the Word of God and the sacred services of our church in such places as these, it wil ultimately make them-what they are not-habitual worshipers within the walls of our church. (Cheers.) Lord KINNAIRD) could confim what had fallen from the right rev. prelate, and had much pleasure in expresuing his cordial approval of these meetingi in Exeter-hall. Their lordships were aware that there were thousands in this metropolis and other large towns vwho never entered the house of God from year's end to year's end, and who never heard the sound of the Gospel. The only way in which they could ever hear the Word of God was from the mouths of missionaries and Scripture readers, and at such meetings as those in Exeter-hall. Their lordships were also aware that on Sundays there were meetings in large halls in this metropolis where crowvds of these men were brought together to hear the exhortations addressed to them by minsters not connected with the church of England, and surely it would be matter of regret if the members of the church of England did not provide for them the same religious opportunities. (Hear, hear.) He thought the public had cause to rejoice that these services in Exeter-halt had been instituted. (Bear.) He was present at the first meeting last Sunday evening, when not fewer than 4,000 persons were present. Meetmgs of that sort were usually composed in a great measure of the female sex, but on this occasion he was happy to see one-half of the audience composed of real workiDg men (hear, hear), men who, would not go into wellfilled and luxurious churches. (Hear, hear.) As they entered the hall the beautiful iatany of the Church of England was put into their bends, and that every one appreciated it was proved by the earnest mannerin which they joined n ithe responsos. (Hear.) Every word that fell from the right rev. prelate who addressed them, urging them to search the Scriptures, was listened to with the utmost attention for about threequarters of an hour, and he never witnessed anything more striing than when the assembly rose to join in a hymn of praise to their Creator. (Hear, hear.) the rejoiced greatly in tbis movement, and believed that it would be the means of effecting muchdgood. (Hear,dhear.) The Archbishop of CANTERBURY rose and was.pro ceeding to addiresasrhe House, when Lord FEVERSHA?,U, who had risen at the same time, began to state the prayer of a petition which he was about to resnt auidloud cries of " Order l." and ca3ls for the Lord CAMPBELL then moved that leave be given to the Archbishop of Canterbury to address the House. The Earl of ELLENBOROUJGH, as a matter of order, objected that there was no question before the House upon ,which such a motion could be based. Earl GRANVILLE submitted to their lordships tbat the right rev. prelate should be allowed to speak upon a subject so interesting to himself. (Hear, hear.) The Archbishop of CANTERBURY said, he thought the question put by the noble viscount (D.n gannon) had been tully and completely answered by his right rev. brother, and, therefore, he would only just ask the noble earl, who was, he was certain, anxious for the welfare of the church, whether it would be wise, even w ere it possible, to check 'what he called these innoations? He could not imagine that any greater reproach or disparagement could be cast upon the church than to suppose it was incapable of accouulno. eating itself to the changing necessities of the age. (Hear, bea.) Lord FEVERSHAM presented a petition from the eight exercent proctors of the Prerogative Court of York, adverr, ing to the Bill relating to probates and adminstrations in England, by which it is proposed to give equitable compensation to divers persons who may sustain any loss of emoluments by the passing of the said Act, aud praying that compensation may be granted them for the severe and ruinous losses they will sustain by reason of the said BilL Lord CAMPBELL rose to present a petition, but was met witheries of " Order," it being now a quarterpast 5, the time fixed forproceeding with the orders of the day, and the noble and learned lord accordingly resumed his seat. SALE OF POISONS BILL. Earl GRANVILLE rose to move the second reading of this Bill, and in doing so suggested that, as there -was a considerable amount of business upon the paper, their lordships should assent to the second reading now without discus sion, in which case he would reserve his statement until the period for going into committee, at which time the merits of the Bill could be fully discussed. The Earl of DERBY hoped it would be understood that in agreeig to the suggestion of the nobie earl the: House would not be considered as committing itself to the Bill.. Earl GRANVILLE said, it was understood that the 'whole discussion should be open upon going into committee. The Dake of CLEVELAND complained that the discussion which had followed the question of the noblo viscount (Dungannon) had exhausted the whole period allowed for the presentation of petitions, and consequently that which he naa to present, which 'was of a highly importantcharacter, could not be laid before their lordships. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH reminded the noble duke that petitions could be presented after the orders of the day had been disposed of. EaTl GRANVILLE thought blame ought not to be cast upon an individual peer for following what bad become the practice of the House. It was no doubt inconvenient that the time set apart for the presentation of petitions and the asking of questions should ba consumed by a debate, and he hopeod their lordships would agree in future to avoid doing so. At the same timne he thought the noble lord (Kinnaird) bad been justified by what had become a practice in that H1ouse. The bill was then read a second time, SHEPHERD1 I DISABIITIES REMOVAL BILL Lord REDESDALE moved the second reading of this private Bill. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY objected, as he did not know 'what ,tho Bill was, none of their lordships having seen it. Lord REDESDALE was understood to state that the Bil was insended to enable the Rev. Mr. Sbepherd, who had been oraiAned in the Scottish Episcopal Church. to hold an Enjglh benefice. The Earl of SEIAFTESBURY said, that by the Act of 17922A-inister ordained by the Episcopal Church of Scot. lapd:could not hold any benefice in England. The reason for that prohibition was that clergymen ordained by the EpOscopa Church of Seotland did not subscribe to the three irticks set forth in the 36th Canon, one of which was the admimion of the Royal supremacy in mattes oocleeiasti . If apnvilaium were ganted to Mr. Shepherd he would bold a benefioe in England without being required to receg. nise the Royal supremuacy. The Bis'hop of BANGOR remarked that that coold not be so, a any clergyman appointed to a benefiLo mst sub. scribe to all the oathx required by the canon. The EArl of SHAFTESBURY aid, what he wished was that al clergytmen wbo held benefice. in England should suscrAibe to the same articles. He believed that the presentBill propoeed to admit a gen. tlemrn to hold a benefioe in England without these con. ditions and therefore he would oppotethe second reading. lord CA&(PBELL suggested that if it were right to aUow a clergYman bonging to the Epicopal church of Sootland or of Aitricato hold a benefioe in England a general law should be psed on the subject. After some conversation, in which the Archbishop of CA2iTRIURY, Lord XIXSrAD, and others took part, and which was not heard in the gallery, the Bill was read a second time. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY gave notice that on a future oocaon he would move that the Bill be referred to a select committee with a view to the futroduction of a general memure PROBATE AND ADMINLISTRTION BILL. On the bringing up of the report of amendments, Earl STANHOPE said, he cordially approved the general scope of the Bill, bht had the strongest doubts as to one of the amendments made in oommittee. By clause 37, as it originally stood, the right of appea in tetamentary cause ws to the Jtdici Committee of the Privy Council. By the Bill, as altered in committee, that right of appeal was transferred to the House of Lords. Now, he doubted whether the House of Lords, rearded as a court of appellate jurisdiction, was so perfect, sofreefrom all error or defect, as to justify them not only in contiuuing the existing system, but in increasing the number of causes brought before it. The defects of the House as a court of appelbate jurisdiction were felt on all sides last year-a feel. nDgoonsent,withthegreatespossble respectfor the noble and learned lords who, with so much honour and credit to themselves, administered the jurisdiction-and their lord. ahi,e sent a Bll to the other Hous to remove thoec defects, which Bill it did nuot pleas the other Rouse to pas. There. fore, whatever defects then exised till remained- there was no change in tbat respet, and hence he doubted whether -it as, poEtic or just to transfer the right of appeal in issneutkm ause. from the Judicial Coin. m1itee tP the Housw -of Lods. If it should please their lordsbi to adhere Xo~ the 'amendment, he thought it wrould e inbenent Wets them to appoint a select committee next dues Xtpsj>l~whether, not by leg5islation, but by the ixeresees UIbrown powers, it might be possi,. ble to place thder appeda jurisdiction on a more satisfac.. tory footisgiJinatpraw. The Earlof MAlMEBIR Y presented a petition 40m the proctors of DotsCommons against the BilL Itwas signed, he said by ST out of 104 proctors, and set forth that the Bill ir pused would reduce the supposed amount of their profits from 90,000L to 15,0001. swyear. This loss wouid fall with peculiar severity upon the petitioners, becaise of the specia oonditions under which they had enterod into partnership with one another. He wisbed to ask the noble and learned lord on the wool. kack wbether he did not think it proper to ve seine compensation to the proctors and their articledac erks, who haa paid 8001. or l,000. each upon being artioled? (Hear.) The LORD CHANCELLOR aid that in reforms, unfortunately, that which was for the general good often fell hardly on particular individuals, who, not improperly, but in fact, profited by the existing systeim. It was anece6sity incident to all improvement, and the questionwhen such losses should be compensated and when not was a very deli. cate one, attended with pain to those who had to decide it. Be was one of those who thougbt that forthe sak-e ot progress it was very desirable for the Legisature to be iberal with reg rdto ompensation, because he believed the feeling that they were acting hat-ly to individuals often stopped useful reform. (HIear, hear.) Had it beenpossible for him to see his way honestly and fairly to recomi mending compensation to those gentlemen it would have given him personally the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. But he could not go so far. He thought all persons who bad entered defacbo into office and hadbeen serving the public had a fair claim. But the case was very different when they were asked to compensate a whole profession. becausean alteration of the law had deprived them of a large portion of their professional emoluments. How could they ascertain what had been the loss of each individusl? Would they have a commission to look into each gentleman's books to see what had been his net profits for a certain number of years past, and how much was to be attributed to the business which the alterations by the Bill affected? It was absolutely impossible. It could not be done, even if it were reasonable to be done. But it was not reasonable, because the disinction was obvious between compensating officers removed and professional persons, the necessity for whose services was diminished by social improvement; and in the present case the professional men who petitioned their lord. i-hips had not so much claim as might be supposed, because they retained all the " common form" business-in other words, exclusive practice-in 99 out of every 100 cases. They represented that the business of the litigated cases, which they would lose, yielded a third of their profits, but he oould only say that was entirely at variance with the information he bad received from other eources. There were but 30 or 40 litigated cases in a 'ear, but in. the same time there vwere 39,000 wills and administrations. Upon these grounds he could not say he thought they had any claim which entitled them to consideration in the shape of compensation. They had what the commissioners recommended-the non. contentious business-and he was afraid that was all the Legislature could do for them. Lord WYNFORD instanced the more liberal manner in which another class of practitioners were to be treated, compensation being guarnteod to the office holders in the different episcopal court throughout the country. A great many of those offices were held by persons who had never practised in any court whatever. The LORD CEANCELLOR said, he intended by an alteration of the 96th clause in the Bill to restrict compensation to persons who had actualy discbarged duties. Lord WYNFORD said, the statement of ithe noble lord was satisfactory as far as it went; but a great many of those who would still be compensated had been appointed since Acts of Parliament had passed, warning them that if they accepted such appointments they would not be entitled to compensation. It seeued to him rather a strong measure to give compensation to them, and to refuse it to the hardworking and expensively educated class of persons, whose case had just been brought under the notice of their Lord ST. LEONARD'S explained that the Act to which the noble lord referred was passed about 20 years ago, and provided that no person subsequently appointed wo any ohfce, in the ecclesiastical c-urts, except the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, should be entitled to compensation. About ten years ago another Act passed, withdrawing the exception to the Prrogative Court of Canterbury, and, as to future appointments, placing the offloers of that court on the sanie footing as the officers of other ecclesiastical courts. In order, therefore, to give compensation under this Bill, it wouldbe necessary to repeal those Acts. He objected to the compensation clause in the BilL The noble and learned lord on the woolsack wished the matter to stand over, and bad to-night stated his intention to make some alteration. EHe should wait to see the alteration of the noble and learned lord before giving any opinion upon the subject. Bnt as to the office holders having a better claim because they had been so long in the enjoyment of their offices, he thought that argument was on the other side of the question. 'hey took oifice, with Acts expressly denying them compensation, and the expectation that the courts would soon be remodelled. If from circumstances the alteration had been postponed for 10 or 20 years, instead of taking effect within a short period of their appointment, they had by so much enjoyed greater benefit than they anticipated. (Elear.) The noblo lord concluded by presenting a petition from the paid clerka of proctors, stating that they were not cognizant of the provisions of the Acts which had been referred to when they entered upon their daties, and that they were not aUowed to serve articles, and praying their Lordships to introduce a clause into the Bill to enable them, on payment of the proper fees, to practise as proctors The Bishop of CHICHESTER was understood to point out the mode in which the Bill would affect the business and emoluments of the officers of the district Consistory Court of Chichester, but the right rev. prelate spoke in so low a tone, and the noise rev ailing in the House at the timne was so considerable, that the purport of his remarks did not reach the gallery. The Earl of DONOUGHMKO10, who was also indistinctly heard, called the attention of the House to the manner in which the Bill, as it stood, was likely to prejudice the interests of the Proctors of the Prerogative Court of Canter. bury, a class of men who had exercised their professional functions for nearly 600 years, He added that all the commisions which had sat to investigate the subject had reported that the services of the proctors had beea attended with benefit to the public. By the Bill, as it stood, the judge of the proposed Court of Probate had an unlimited jm., ,,r aunuin pesnst_rats a rotr-i i POueruo admitfng persons to practise as proctors inL his court; and he (the Earl of Donoughmore) contended that if the practico of the new court were thrown open in the way Iroposed the present proctors would have an irresistible claim to oompensation. He complained also that the Bil withdrew from the proctors a very large 1ortion of the non- ceontentious busine.s of tbe existing jurisdiction which was nowtransacted bythem. He addedthat he should like to know fyom the noble and. learned lord on the woolsack what he really proposedto do with theofflce of proctor. Did he mean to abolish the offlce altogether? If he did let him say so at once. He was anxious to see the testamentary jurisdiction placed upon a more satisfactory footing, and he believed that a material improvement would be effected by the establishment of a Court of Probete. After a few words from Lord WEN?SLEYDALE, The Marquis of WESTMEATH said he bad always entertained a very strong opinion' on the subject of compensation in cases of this kind. The generally received opinion in this country was that if a beneficiall ffice were abolished the holder of such office should have compensation. HIe (the Marquis of Westmeath) must, however, be allowed to say tha tthe fees charged by proctors weremot excessive, for where attorneys charged 6s. Sd. the exorbitant proctors chargedl3s. 4d.

LordBURGHLEY asked the Under-Secretary for War whether the Government would aUo w thesons of those adiutants of militia who are retired officers of the Une to ba admitted to the müitary schools on the same terms as the sons of otucers of the army. Sir J. BAMSDEN repUed that if the officers referred to had Toluntanly retired on half-pay, had received the difference, or had sold their commissions, their sons would not be entitled to admission to those schools on the samefooting as the sons of officers of the army; in other cases thev would be. TORTÜRE ?? INDIA. Lord O. HAMILTON rose to ask the President of the Board of Control whether any investigations as to the practice of torture in Bombay and Bengal were instituted by Government m 1854, similar to those which led to the Madras report of April, 1855; and whether the results of those investigations would be laid before Parliament. - ??* V-SMITH said that no commission had been issued m the presidencies of Bengal and Bombay, because the late Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, had thought it better to act at once. The clauses inthe penal code, which were now under consideration by the Legislative Councü would apply to all parte of India. The papers referring to this subject would be laid upon the table as soon as they were copied. SERGEANTS ? THE ARMY. Sir J. TRELAWNY asked the Under-Secretary for War, with reference to an order of the 10th day of January, l»o7, aUowing soldiers made sergeants since that date to retain their previously earned good conduct money, whether it was the intention of the war authorities that sergeants created before the 10th day of January, 1857, and whose good conduct money ceased under regulations then in force on their becoming sergeants, should remain in a worse position than their brother non-commissioned officers who without more merit, have served f or shorter periods in thé rank of sergeants. Sir J. RAMSDEN supposed the hon. gentleman must refer to a memorandum dated not the 10th, but the 16th of January. If he would look at that document he wouldfind that this aUowance was made to aU sergeants now servin"· and was quite, irrespective of the date at which they received their promotions. There was no injustice; aU were subject to the same regulation. JOINT-STOCK BANKS.

(Hear, hear! ) BRAZIL. Mr. ROEBUCK rose, pursuant to notice, to call the attention of theHouso tothe subject of our reUtions with Brazü, and to move for a select committee to take into consideration those relations, and to report thereupon. The hon. and learned gentleman said that the object which he had in view in taking that course was to invite the House to resume the functions which for some time past it had abdicated with respect to our relations with foreign States. Those relations had of late been altogether under the control of the noble lord at the head ofthe Government, and in one instance an expedition had been undertaken, a batUe fought, and peace declared with a foreign country without any ^formation upon a matter so important having been received bythe House of Commons. The observations which he was now desirous of submitting to the House had reference to a different country, butto one our relations with which were abo of the utmost moment-he aUuded to Brazil, and if the House would bear with him he should enter into a few details with regard to the position in which we stood towards that empire. We had, so far back as the year 1S26, agreed to a treaty with Brazü-which had very shortly before acquired her mdependence-upon the subject of the slave trade Under tte provisions of that treaty any participation in that trade upon the part of any subject of Brazü was de(Oared to be piracy. That undertaking had been given upon the part of the Government of Brazil-? constitutional Government-f or the people of that country. Brazü, it was true, had an Emperor, but he was a constitutional monarch, and their Legislature made Uws for the whole communis no laws havmg a binding force which were not madeba constitutional manner. WeU, shortly after the year 1826 a further treaty or convention had been entered into between this country and Brazil, by which it was declared that a reciprocal right ot search shonld exist, and that a power to put an end to tb invention, upon notice given, should belongtoecah of the contracting parties. That state of things had gone on for some time ; but the convention had beejiput an end to in tte year 1844 upon notice given, andthe nght of search had, as a consequence, been done away with. Lord Aberdeen, who had at the time been SecretiT fT· Foreign Affairs undei:the Government ¿?&????? thereupon introduced a Bill into the Hous? ¿fardi ?? which power wasgiven to British courts of jS ft ^?Îc*itei.npon.6hlp3JteI£?1 ??8? »he treaty of 1S26.

Theresult of tte^uuìtruotionhadbeenttattheyouiigPrincehadbecome» model monarch, and had shown himself thorough!» desirous °,f caî^u18 out in a liberal spirit the constitution'of BrazU. Ureat difficulties had, however, presented themselves in his path, but notwithstanding these difficulties he had carried °n the Government for some time, giving to it stability and framing good laws. The commercial situation of Brazü at the period of the declaration of independence was a subject to which he (Mr. Roebuck) must alsorefer. SUveryhadat the time been predominant in that country, andthe trade in slavery carried on by its inrtiÄr.F?',81'1?1' So great, indeed, hadbeen that homd traffic that «Jarm began to be created among the white population of Brazil, and pubUo opinion had beoome completely opposed to its continuance. He might also state that up to tte period in question sugar had been the chief product of BrazU, but that it had been discovered that tbe cultivation of coffee might be made a very profitable source of revenue, and ttat it might be entered into without necessitating the employment of the same amount of labour as was required in the case of sugar. The result had been that tho trade in sUves had become a matter of much less importance than had previously been the case ; and, as the noble lord at tte head of the Government had admitted upon a former occasion, that it had been put an end to. The Saw had even been stretched sof« ? to lead to the sUvetraders being drjven out of Brazü, and bemg obliged to repair to Cuba or some more hospitable quarter. That such had been the lase everybody must rejoice to learn, and he, as weU as the noble lord, regarded tte trade in slaves as a most infamous and disgraceful traffic. The circumstances justified him in saying that the Act of 184a? ought to be repealed. Suppose that the executive of England had chosen, under a treaty with Brazü, to make it an act of piracy to introduce com into this country. Would ttat be Uw î If the House substituted the word " skve" for "corn," ttat was what the Government of Brazü had done The Brazilian Government determined that any subjeot of Brazü engaged ? the slave trade should be treated as guüty of piracy. Theydid not, however, pass aUw makfog á mracg and when Lord Aberdeen introduced that Act mto the House of Lords he attacked the sovereignty of the people of Brazü. The Act was introduced, no doubt with very good intentions, and it might have worked well, but it was not the less an attack on the sovereignty ¡of Brazil which the people of that country resented. The consequence was that the people and Government of BrazU refused to enter into a treaty with us upon any subject whatever untU that Act were repealed. By ttat Act an English cruiser might go into the Brazffisn waters, and under the forts of Brazü cut out any ship which tte commander considered a slaver, the question bemg decided not before a tribunal in which Brazü had any power, but by a tribunal whoUy English. This, had created great irritation in BrazU. and the Americans had endeavoured to take advantage of the circumstance to admit aU BrazUian goods duty free except sugar. The Americans, like tte BraziUans, were a slave-holdrng people, and they were the dominant people of North as the Brazilians were of South America. Thev therefore said to the Brazilians, "Enter with us into a treaty oöensive and defensive, which wül place you beyond the control of England." The Brazilians, under the control of that model Monarch to whom he had alluded, refused to enter into a treaty with England untü the Act of 1845 was repealed. Now, BrazU was the fourth nation npon the list of our customers, and imported annually from England goods to the value of 12,000,000*. America took her goods without taxing.them, whüe we imposed those tases upon her exports which our necessities compeUed ?? to levy Stül, however, BrazU, as the representative of sovereignty in America, was more inolined to aUiance with England than with the United States. He wished the House to consider our reUtions witt that countiy, and not to leave them in the hands of the executive. AU he asked the House was to inquire; not to determine anything, but to consider the policy of repealing tte Act of 1845. Under the control of the noble viscount at the head of the Government we had been jarring with aU the world. Ihe noble lord, it was true, had made peace with Russia, but he had quarreUed with China and Persia ho had introduced confusion into IndU, and we might be at war with any part of Europe. He would ask the noble lord what danger would possibly accrue if a select committee sat to consider whether the act of 1845 ought to be continued, and whether it would not be wise to coneffiate the only monarchy in America upon a matter on which they had succumbed to the feeling of the world, and had become, like ourselves, thel enemies of the slave trade. A more magnificent system of rivers did not exist on the face of tteglobe than was possessed by BrazU. The chief communiration between many of the provinces of that country was by sea andif the people wanted to send a party of slaves from one province to another they were obUged to send them by sea Our cruisers sometimes captured these vessels, and decUred ttem to be sUves from Africa. They were then taken before our courts, and were at once condemned.. Thus the internal traffic of Brazü was interfered witt by our cruisers, and our cruisers, under the forts of BrazU, took possession of ships that were transporting slaves from one province of Brazü ?? another. The coast of Brazü was 4,000 miles in length. There were various forts on that line of coast, and under the guns of ttose forts tte English cruisers took possession of theso Brazilian ships. Shonld we do this to a strong 5?wer î Suppose an English vessel seized a ship going from New Orleans up tte Chesapeake, with sUves on board, and carried her before an English tribunaL Why, America would be in arms ; we should be obUged to succumb, and we should show ourselves, as we always were under the noble lord, subservient to the strong and proud and overbearing to tho weak. Where a nation had the power to defend itself we were the humble servant of that nation. Why did not the noble lord interfere with Cuba? The noble lord knew why. Ho dared not; and shonld it be said that an English House of Commons would aid and abet aU proceedings to subjugate and coerce the weak, whUe before the strong we were humble and subservient; If tte noblo lord would throw the responsibUity upon the House of Commons, justice would be done ; but if this matter were left to the Government, it would be left to men who considered power and influence synonymous witt violence and braggadocio. The people of Brazil, solicited on the one hand by the Government of America, and treated on the otter with contumely by the Government of EngUnd, felt that we were doing aU we could to induce them to break off friendly reUtions with this country, and to ally themselves witt a sUve-holding Power Uke the United States. He looked upon such a state of things with considerable apprehension. Brazü was a fertile country, capable of furnishing us not only with sugar and coffee, but also with cotton, and thereby of rendering ns independent of America. If we could create either in India or in BrazU a Power that could supply us with the raw material of our chief manufacture we should be reaUy independent of the United States '· whereas we now succumbed to every insolent demand of that country. The hon. and learned gentleman concluded by moving for a select committee to take into consideration our relations with Brazü, and to inquire whetter it was not desirable to repeal the Act of 1845. The question having been put, Lord PALMERSTON said,-Sir, I cannot refrain at the outset from expressing my surprise ttat a person luce the hon. and learned gentleman who has just sat down, who has given his attention to public affairs, who understands the current of events, and to whom neither the present nor the near past can be unknown, should give countenance to the vulgar and unfounded insinuations which persons far below him in position attempt to propagate-namely, that it is the practice of England to bully tte weak and truckle to the strong. (Hear, hear.) Does not the hon. and learned gentleman remember the time In his life, and in mine, when England stood alone, opposed to almost every Power in Europe, which combined against her-when she held a firm front to every enemy that could be brought to threaten her ? And does he not also remember that at a more recent period she undertook ? great struggle against one of the most formidable empires in the world, and carried on that war at a remote distance from her own shores and on the territory of Russia, the country in antagonism witt her ; I am astonished that for the purposes of i argument the hon. and learned gentleman should wish to impose en the credulity of his hearers and try to persuade ttem of that whioh is directly tte contrary of historical fact. (Hear, hear.) He has, however, made an admission which entitles mo to claim his support against his own motion. (A laugh.) He says ttat nothing is further from his intention than to do anything which may in the remotest degree assist or encourage the slave trade-ttat no man feels morg deeply than himself the horrors of this traffic ; and therefore, if I can satisfy him that his proposition has a direct tendency to stimulate the slave trade he is bound in consistency to abandon this motion. The hon. member has faUen into error in a material fact which he stated. Evidently speaking from information not gathered by himself, but furnished to him by interested parties, he asserts that the Act of 1845 is stül in operation ; that our cruisers now act in virtue of the powers given by that law ; and that our ships daüy stop and detain vessels coasting along tte shores of Brazil. This is an entire mistake. The Act of 1S45 has by mutual consent been suspended for several years past, our ships do not interfere with vessels sailing along tho coast of Brazü, and that Uw is at the present moment, for aU practical purposes, a dead letter. Again, in 1826 the Government of BrazU entered into a treaty, not simply to make the slave trade piracy, but to abolish it by preventing any of their subjects from engaging in it. And the discussions which have since arisen between ttat country and Great Britain have not turned on the technical point dwelt upon by the hon. and learned gentleman-viz., whether or not the BrazüUn Government made tte slave trade piracy. They turned on the wider question, whether that Government did not bind itself to exert its authority to put down this traffio, in which respect it had notoriously violated the engagements into which it originaUy entered. I should be insulting this House if I were to endeavour by any argu. ment to convince ttem that the slave trade is one of the greatest crimes which have ever stained the hnman racethat it demoralizes aU ttose employed in it, and is the ruin of the countries by which it is carried on; and that England has in no respect done herself more hononr than by the unwearying and persevering efforts she has put forth from 1815 down to the present time to extinguish this detestable traffic. (Hoar.) WeU, we had a treaty with Portugal when BrazU separated from that country, and Brazü took with he* fteengagemrotebywhichttePortuguesewerebound.

For some four or five years thafc law was left unacted upon; but in the year 1850, the Brazilian Government having neglected repeated warning whichany hoa.gentleman, by looking at the records of thl slave trade in the library (consisting of the annual reports thereon laid before Parliament) wiU see at full length and havbg . done nothing 'whatever to Dut a stop to this criminal trade, it was determined to entrust the enforcement of the Act no longer to the BrazUian Government, but to try aU charged with a vioUtion of that Act by a mixed tribunal A great outcrv was immediately raised about the national dignity and independence havini been invaded, and every sort of appeal was made a^iñsb that course. Assurance was given that measures would ?? taken by Brazils herself that would be as effectual as the operation of that Uw. Our Minister at BrazU, and our admiral upon the coast consented to accept this assurance and to suspend tte operations of the Act. They were suspended, bnt so also was suspended the action of the Brazilian Government with reference to tte suppression of the sUva wade. Instead of ttose measures which the BrazUian Government had promised tte sUve trade was aUowed to revive to its utmost extent. In January foUowin" our Minister told the BrazUian Minister, " You have brokenyour engagements; you have failed to fulfil your promise; the slave trade is not put down; no new measures have been takenforthe purpose. Everything is goingon just as before ; and therefore I teU you that the actof 1845 must be ??n.oyoo· It was renewed, and after a certain time the BrazUian LegisUture did co-operate with tte Brazilian Government in passing laws, which were to a considerable degree effectual, and when we found that the Brazffian Government was in earnest, and reaUy took steps to put down this abominable slave trade, then, again, the operation of the Act of 184o was suspended, and has been suspended from that time to this. (??????.) The Act has not been repealed, and : most dangerous would it be for many Years to come to repeal it, because its existence is "a security for the continuance of the Government of Brazil in tho course wbch it has adopted; and the hon. and learned gentleman is entirely mistaken in thinking thafc the Act is now in active operation-on the contrary, it has from that time to this been entirely suspended. The hon. and learned gentleman says that our commerce isinjureä by the treaty against the slave trade, and by the position in which, it places Brazü as regards the United States. But the Brazilians are more dependent upon the United States than we are, because they draw from the United States a great portion of those breadstuff's which are essential t> their subsistence.. They are indeed a singular instance of an empire vast in its extent, comprising within its limits every variety of climate and sou, capable of producing almost everything that grows in any other part of the world, and yet importing bread from America and stone to· pave the towns of BrazU from Aberdeen in Scotland (" Hear.hear," and laughter), having everyopportunity to grow sufficient food for themselves, and having stone ia abundance which might be applied to the purposes for which they get it from Scotland. But the hon. and learned gentleman says that though our trade is in danger yet we annuaUt export 12,000,000i. worth of produce to Brazil, Why, Sir, if we do that without a commercial treaty, what more could we do if we had one ? We made a great mistake with Portugal in times past in making a treaty to limit ths amount of duty that was to be imposed upon British goods, for I hold that kind of treaties to be detrimental to the interests both of the country ttat fixes that limited duty and the country which apparently is to derive a benefit from it. (Hear, hear.) Those treaties are opposed to the fundamental principles of poUtical economy, and I trust that no treaty of that sort ever wiU be entered into between this and any other country in the world. BrazU should be fres to lay upon our importations tbat which she may think best adapted to her financial interests; but does any man seriously imagine that the people of Brazil, who import thesa 12,000000/. worth of commodities, and who send us an equal value in return, are actuated in any degree» by a knowledge of this Act of 1845, which is a dead letter, the existence of which is only known to the Government and to those who wish to encourage that slave trade which it is calculated to prevent ? It is very well for those who may wish on either side of the Atlantic to revive this slave trade to represent this Act as a bar to the commercial intercourse between the two countries ; but those who know what that commercial intercourse is and the foundation upon which it rests ¡know very weU that the existence of the Act has no effect whatever in restricting our reUtions with the empire of Brazil. It is quite true, as the hon. and learned gentleman says, that the Emperor of Brazil, his present Ministers, and, no doubt, aU the enUghtened men of that country are on principle adverse to the slave trade, and determined to put it down as far as their means wiU enable them to do so ; but it is not true, as the hon. and learned gentleman has been cold, that there have been no importations or ai tempts of importation made. That very case to which he aUuded-the importation of the Surinam-is in truth an attempt to revive the sUva trade, and wo know that it is not the only attempt which. is likely to be made. It is also a proof of the difficulty wbjjfi any Government of BrazU, however sincerely anxious toput down the slave trade, must have in resisting that combination of selfish and corrupt interests which tend to encourage and renew the trade. What happened in that case ? There was an attempt to Und a cargo of slaves. All the authorities were of course supposed to be determined to resist it ; but the governor of the district was absent, the government officers havingbeen told to go another way. Every faculty was given for landing the slaves and for their being distributed over the plantations to which. they wero destined. But our consul, with an activity that did nim great honour, interfered, not in the insolent manner described by thehon. and learned gentleman, but by representing the matter at once to a few BrazUian gentlemen, who, together with some inferior persons, enabled him to arrest these negroes. And what did the Government do ? Why, those persons who were most active in detecting that attempt and endeavouring to thwart it were all put in prison and prosecuted, butthe gailty parties to whom these slaves were consigned remained at Urge subject to no proceedicg. That very case, therefore, is a proof ttat there still exists in BrazU among individuals-not I trust among the pubUc at large, and certainly not among the members of the Executive Government at Rio but among a certains number of parties a proneness to protect and encourage the dave trado, to receive those bribes which slavetraders are quite ready to give. All these are disposed to connive afc tne slave trade. I say, then, that, if tho House were to agreeto the motion of the hon. and learned gentleman to appoint a committee, Intelligence thereof would berecetyeå with acclamation by all those who are interested in the produce of BrazU and in the slave trade, and who are only waiting for an opportunity to elude the vigilance of our cruisers, as a proof that thie House of Parliament is prepared to reverse the poUcy which this country has pursued ever since 1815, and ttey would loot with anticipation to some proceeding that would supply them with fresh scope andopportunityfortheircrmiinab projects. The hon. and learned gentleman says that Lord Aberdeen made a promise that when the dave trade» in Brazil was put an end to he would consent to the repeal of this Act. .1 know nothing of that promise, but when th& hon. and learned gentleman says thatthe slave trade ia Brazü is put an end to, I maintain that although ttat ia to a great extent true withregard to the present it is not s» with regard to the future. The slave trade is stopped for tha moment, but you have no security whatever thttit would not revive ; on tto contrary we know for certain ttat thera are parties now lookup out for opportunities for iterevhS!

BLECTION IHTELLIGZNOE. READIN(-. MAY 9O Mr. Keating, Q.C., the member for this borough, who has received the appointment of Solicitor-General, as successor to the Right Hon. J. Stuart Wortley, aived here this evening, and the news soon spread through the towin. The hon. and learned gentleman has received the hearty congratulations of his constituency on the honour which the Government has conferred upon him. Eis address soliciting re-election has not yet appeared, but It is hourly expected. It Is not likely that any opposition will be offered to his being again retarned as the representative of the borough, the manner in wthich he has hitherto disc.harged his Parliamentary dutieshavineg given general satisfaction. Even should another candidate aPpear-and the Conservatives have shown no disposition for a contestthere would be no chance of his success. LEEDS. Yesterday morning an address was eirculated in Leeds from Mr. W. E. Forster, of Burley, dated from the Reform Club, offering himself as a candidate for Leeds in the room of the late Mr. Hall. In his address Mr. Forster merely mentions his intention of becoming a candidate, and does not say any' hing of his political views, but states that he shall embrace the first opportunity of presenting himself before the electors. This address has brought forward another from Mr. John Remington Mills, the defeated Liberal candidate at the late election. Mr. Mils says 5- "Tbh sentiments which I profewed on the late occasion, and which obtained your cond4snoe, remain unchanged-viz., of attachment to the grcat princiDles of civil and religions liberty, which require the removal of Jewish dIsabiltIes and abolition of church-rates -of the xnecesslty of obeerving a wizs eonomy In th a pubUc expenriture-of rctiryng the abuse of our ecclestastIcal courts and laws -of supporting Parliamentary reform-and of providing for the unfettered use of the elective franchise by means of the ballot.' Mf. Mills was to address a pubhc meeting of the selector at the Stock-Exchange yesterday evening. FALMOlJTH AND PENRYN. The nomination of a member for this borough, owing to Mr. T. G. Baring having accepted office as a Junior Lord of the Admiralty, took place at the Town-hall, Penryn, ort Wednesday, and Mr. Gwyn, formerly M.P. for the borough, having declined to make his appearance, or to accede to the solicitations of his party, Mr. Baring, who was proposed by Mr. James Mead, of Penryn, and seconded by Mr. Robert R. Broad, of Falmouth, was re-elected enthusiastically. Mr. Baring returned thanks in a speech cf nearly an hour's duration. 1e stated that whatever embarrassment he might have felt at the honour conferred on him at the last election itwas now muchincreased by the additional debt of gratitude be laboured under for the positionhe then occupiea by being returned so cordiaJly a second time, upon grounds and principles totally different from those practised under systems of bygone days, which he trasted never to see revived flis re-election also proved that in accepting office he had not sim ly done no wrong, but that the step had been approved oy his supporters, who rightly presumed their local affairs would suffer no prejudice by his connexion with the Goverument of Lord Palmerston, the general policy and progressive measures of whose administration he cordially acquiesced in. Mr. Baring then went into a fall revrew of the political questions of the day, aud referred to the several Bills about to be introduced into Parliament by the Government,-viz., the Extension of the Franchise, the Oath and Abjuration Bill, Church-rates, Education, and several others. He considered the present Government very strong, and, having alreadT foreshbadowed theirintentions,whichwere-eryliberaland smtedtotnespirit and requirements of the times, there vas no reason to doubt their carrying them at the proper moment, fearlessly courting discussion, and relying on the approval of the Crown and the people. Mr. Baring concluded by stating his approval of mnemibers appearing periodically before their constituents and explaining their views.
MR. BRIGH's L} T.-The letter of Mr. Bright to some frieuds at Hawick, though not necessitating a discussion of the topics touched upon, is worthy of note for its writer's sake, as neither his former mistakes nor his present absence from the field of politieal fight can deprive the words of so able and withal so honest a man of nse and influence. It is not necessary that any comment should be made upon bis statement that our military expenditure is now double what it was in 1835, although we have no more territory to defend,"-except indeed"that the more truthful way of putting the case would have been to say, that our military expenditure is only about half of what it was a year ago, though it is little more than a year since a treaty of peace concluded a costlgy and arduous war. The chief thing to be noted in the letter is Mr. Bright's muchneeded and from him most valuable warning against relying for real Parliamentary reform upon a mere lowering of the franchise. " It would be easy to double the nunber of electors, and at the same time to increase the aristocratic influence in Parhament," is a fact we have often sought to exhibit, and which will be aecepted at once on Mr. Bright's word just In those quarters where such a warning is most wanted. What Mr. nright means by "a just apportionment of members" may be doubtful; but it is to be hoped he will perceive in time, from Mr. Disraeli's speech, if it has escaped his notice hitherto, that an exact apportionment, as to either population, property, or electors, would be a great gain to that "anistocratic influence" which he fears may be promoted by an indiscriminate suffrage extension. The blot in the letter is, to our view, the reference to " any trick to obstruct the free action of majorities such as that proposed in Lord John Russell's last Bill." Withoutenteringon adiscussionat present, and without expressing approval of Lord John's plan, which seemed needlessly complicated, we would utter a modest caution against Mr. Bright's dictum on this point being accepted as unquestionable. What he denounces as a "trick to obstract a free action of majorities" is simply a plan for preventing majorities becoming monopolies and minorities becoming nonentities-for giving both majority and minority a share in the representation proportionate to the share each has in the constituent body. It is a question the importance of which, if not created, will be immensely increased by any newr " apportionment of representatives;* and MIr. Bright, though his intentions are unfriendly, has done some service by recalling it to the public mind.- fScotsman. EXTRAORDINARY C0EARGE OF MuRDER.-At the Bil8ton Police-court on Tuesday Philip Clare, a miner, waa charged before Mr. J. Leigh with the murder, on the 30th nlt., of a young woman named Elizabeth Hopley. Police. constable Ponder stated that con the 30th nlt., about 5 O'clock, he was called by a man named Bnckley, with whom he went to the banks of the canal at Bradley, where he found the body of a young woman, whose name he afterwards ascertained to be Elizabeth Hopley. George Powell, a watchman in the employment of Mr. David Pose, then made a most remarkable and circumstantial statement, to the following purport:-He said that shortly after 12 o'clock on the morning upon which the body of the girl was found he was upon duty, asd observed the shadow of two people on the canal bridge. On going up he heard the girl exclaim, "Philip, don't kll me; you said you would kill me before." The prisoner then knocked her down. Witness on that said to himi. " Philip. you'll suffer for thi." The prisoner replied that if witness told anybody be should serve nim the same way. Witness then watched, and saw the prisoner put the girl in the water, he expecting every moment to suffer the same fate. Witness then returned towards the, works, ans& was overtaken by the prisner, who aan threatened to use himi the same way if nhetold anybody; and othis thfreatherpeate,d oÃ¯Â¿Â½n sheverpalhsGubsequesnet ocasions.

THE CAPE COLONY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-As one who has passed the last three or four years on the Caffre frontier, may I crave a very small space in your columns? Colonel E. Napier, in your journal of yesterday, suggests placingthe Boors between us and the Cafes. This is plansible, no doubt, but somewhat impracticable; the Boors are quite unequal to cope with the Gaikas of the last war, whatever they may have been when Colonel Napier was last on the frontier; besides, these apathetio Dutchmen ate not likely to leave their present quiet homes on the banks of the Orange River for a reiddenco in the neighbourhood of such amiable chiefs as UmhnLs, Pato, &e. The phases of frontier life and policy at the Cape chango so rapidly that any one having left that country six or seven years back would find it difficult to recognize things under their present aspect. In the meantime, it Is satisfactory to know that all is working towards improvement. Sir George Grey is indefatigable,-he is here, there, and everywhere,- and when I quitted the Cape some few months ago his chief recreation consisted in mastering the Caifre language. As regards the German Wegion, in spite of what has been said both in and out of Parliament, those on the spot think they will do well; we know the Germans make capital colonists in every other part of the world, and why they should not succeed in Caffrelsad, aith arms in their hands, remains to be seen. The credulity with which numbers o the Caffres have slaughtered their cattle in obedience to the prophet will, I take it, at all events have one good effect e viz., of making them take service in the colony, and at once commence to earn an honest livelihood, The Fingoes, a constant source of anxiety to the frontier authorities, have now become a rich and thriving race, and give securities for their future good behaviour in the posession of houses, lands, waggons, &c., which in case of disloyalty they could at once be deprived of. In the less exposed districts wool-growing flourishes, and further south the wine-growers have not storeroom sufficient for the produce of their prolific vines. In short, if John Bull will only avoid the suicidal measure of too hastily reducing the force on the frontier, and by so doing spend some few hundreds where otherwise a triennial Caffre war will cost him millions, all will be well, and in a short time he need never aRain trouble himself about th,Lt 'horrid ESPERAMZA. Gape." Army and Navy Cltb, May 28.
THB ART TREASuRmS ExTTmioN.-The attendance on Wednesday was the beat since the opening, reach. ing 9,333. Of these 2,959 had season tickets and 6,374 paid the shilling for admission. The arrivals by railway were 2,228. The half-crown day (yesterday) was not so good as hitherto up to 3 o'clock, at which time about 4,000 people were present. RoYAL MF.IcfL BENLVOLE1T CoLLBGz The fifth anniversry of this institution was celebrated yesterday, the object of which is to found an asylum for those members of the profession who from illhealth or other adverse in'duences have sunk into poverty, and for the widows of medical men in reduced circumstances,-with a sebool, devoted in part to the gratuitous education oforphans of medical men. Earl Granville was expected to preside on tbh occasion, but the debate in the House of Lords prevented his Lordship from attending till a late hour, the chair meanwhile being most ably fiDed by MIr. Profect, who, we nnderstood, was the gentleman who first origiated the institution. hlr. Profect n proposing the toast of the eveninz, explained the objeots of the institution to he to maintain an asylum in which 100 pensioners, who must be duly qualified medical men, or their widows, not under 50 years of age (possessing incomes of at least 151. a-year, shall be provided with three furnished rooms eacb, and with such additional assistance and accommodation as the fands may permit; to provide a school for 200 boys, the sons of duly qualified medical men, 35 of whom will beeducated, boarded, clothed, and main. tained entirely at the expense of the Institntion, the remainder to be charged at the lowest rate which is found to be practicable; and to grant annuities and occasional pecuniary assistance to distressed members of the medical profession or their families, as the funds * of the college may from time to time permit. The appeal of the chairman was well re3ponded to, the subscriptions amounting to nearly 2,500%L Earl Granville, who arrived late in the evening, was most warmly received. The musical arrangements were under the direction of lr. Shoubridge, and were carried out by UIiss Eyles, Mr. Fielding, Mr. H. Buckland, and Mr. S. W, Butler, Mr. Toole =Weaz efficient toastmaster.

LONDOR, FBIDAY. MAY 29, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord DuwoANzoN called the attention of the I Bishop of LONDON to certain services performed in Exeter-halt on Sunday evenings by prelates and clergymen of the Church of England. He wished to know whether the bishop considered these proceedings in accordance with the rules and discipline of the Church ? The Bishop of LoNDoN replied that there could be no doubt that such a service had taken place. He believed that services of this kind were not only strictly legal, but that they supplied a want felt by thousands of the com-munity. Lord KLNNAIRD confirmed aU that had faUen from the Bishop of LOzzvox, and expressed his cordial approval of these Mpetings. The report ex. the Probate and Administration Bill was brolhk u and received, after speeches from Lord foAHopz, who protested again. fhe I light of appeal -proosed to be granted in testamen1 -j matterE to their lordihips' House, instiedof to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; and from Lord ALMZEsBBUuY, who urged ot the LoRanD CKCZLLOR the necesity of granting some compensation to proctors for the lomes they iould Sustain by the operation of the Bill. The llouse then resumed the consideration in committee of the Divorce Bill, when The Biuhop of OS:FOB asked permission, before the discussion on the proposition to abolish the action of damnages for crinal converslation wasresumed, to move the following proviso at the end of the 43d "Provided nevertheless, tbat, inasmuch as by the law Of this realm and church the bond of mxarrige bath hitherto been indissoluble, no clerk in holy orders of the Church of England shall, after the passing of th.iAc, be lable to any censure, penalty, or punishment whatever, in alY court, ecoleiastical or civil, for refusing to perform the marriage service over auy person or persons 'ho, having been married and divorced, shall seek to be ea,ried ain during the lifetime of the husband or wife from whom they have been divoroed under the provisions of this Act." After some discussion, the proviso was negatived on a division, the numbers bemg:- Contents... ... ... ... 26 Non-contents ... ... ... 78 Majority ... . -52 On clau 44, relating to the action for criminal conversation, considerable discussion arose, during which the LoRD CRAxcELLOR mid he thought that this action ought to follow and not precede the proof of the wife's guilt. Lord LvaDuns'r moved an amendment, the effect of which-was to abolish the action altogether. Lord ST. LEoxAna's pro. posed a fine on the adulterer. The Bishop of OxrOBD thought that if facilities were given to divorce a more distinctly criminal character should be given to the act of adultery; Lorej WE NSYDALE defended the action for criminal conversation as one coeval with the law of England, while Lord CA&psBnzdeclaxe it to beadisgrace to the law. Ultimately Lord DEBry suggested an amalgamation of Lord Sr. LEoXARD's and Lord LY"nHunsrTs amendments, so that the effect of the clause would be to provide that it should not be competent for any person to bring an action for damages for criminal conversation, but that whoever should commit adultery with a married woman should be deemed guilty of a miademeanour. This suggestion was adopted, and the clause as amended was agreed to. The remaining clauses and the preamble were agreed to. The House then resumed, and the Bill was reported. Their lordships then adjourned till Thursday next. In the House of Commons, in answer to MNr. Kn'WAD, Lord PALmmsTox was happy to say that the treaty on the subject of leuchatel had been accepted by both the parties-the Swiss and the King of Prussia,-and actually signed a few days ago, so that the question might be considered as satisfactorily settled. MIr. ROEBuCK called attention to the subject of our relations with Brazil. He referred to the Act (Lord Aberdeen's) of 1845,which had created,he aid, great indignation in the minds of the people of Brazil, and he urged that, as the slave trade had been put an end to there, and had utterly disappeared, the slave-tradershavimg been expelled, .and the trade itself having been denounced by the Brazilian Government as piracy, thatAct, which had the effect of impeding our commercial relations with Brazil, should be repealed. He moved for a select committee to inquire into our relations with Brazil, and into the policy of repealing the Act of 1845. Lord PAL=uERsTo, after expreesing his surprise that a person like Mr. RozBucva should have given countenance in the course of his speech to the vulgar and unfounded insinuation that it was the practice of England to bully the weak and succumb to the strong, observed that he had erroneously assumed thatthe Act of 1845was stillin operation, whereas it had been suspended by mutual consent for some years past, and for all practical purposes was a dead letter. That Act, he said, had been justified by the conduct of the Brazilian Government with relation to the slave trade; they had neglected repeated warnings, and refused to do anything to stop that trade according to treaty. In 1850, upon an intimation that the provisions of the Act would be enforced, an assurance was given by the Brazilian Government that measures would be taken to put down the trade, andthe Act was suspended; but, instead of the promised measures,i etrade was prosecuted to the utmost extnet. The Act was consequently put in operation, and produced its proper effect; and when our Government found that of Brazil was in earnest, the operation of the Act was suspended, and had continued so until the present time. Nevertheless, it would, inhis opinion, be most dangerous to repeal the Act, there being parties at Rio prone to protect and encourage the slave trave. He therefore entreated Mr. RoEBu1JC and the House not to take a step that would be misunderstood by the Brazilians, and have the effect of renewing this hateful traffic. Ilr. BRAMIEY-MOOrE supported the motion. He characterized the Act of 1845 as an interference with the sovereignty and independence of Brazil, the Government of which, he contended, had been sincere in its efforts to put down the slave trade. But the subject was a difficult one; the slave trade existed, he said, in the British colonies, and even at Sierra Leone. Mr. M. Mixa trusted that the House would not agree to the motion for a committee, which would be totally useless for the purpose in view. After a reply by Mr. RoEBucr, Mr. DisanrL observed that the motion was a very strong one, inasmuch as it proposed to take the management of our diplomatic relations with a foreign Power out of the hands of the Government, and thereby implied a want of confidence in the Government. He understood that MIr. RoEButc did not represent any particular complaint on the part of the Brazilian Government with refierence to the Act in question, and he understood from Lord PAdu,nsTox that the Act was at this moment in susFense by mutual agreement between the two countries, and under these circumstances he could not support the motion. At the same time, the subject was one which, in his opinion, ought to interest the HIouse. Lord J. Russxzn said it appeared that for some time our efforts to induce the Brazilian Government to exert itself in putting down the slave trade had failed ; but, by increased vigilance on our part and more stringent measures directed by the Foreign-office, the trade was put an end to, owing to its being found to be a losing concern. Believing this to be the real state of the facts, he desired to leave this question in the hands of the Government. Upon a division, the motion was negatived by 312 to 17. Sir C. NApIm'. moved for a select committee to inquire into the constitution of the Board of Ad- miracy, wsntl the view ot rendering it more eflicient, and better ada pted to the various duties it has to perform. He said there was scarcely a naval officer to whom he had spoken who considered that the Board was constituted as it ought to be, andthishad been admitted even by Lords of the Admiralty themaselves. He appealed to the recorded testimony of witnesses, especisily of the late Sir GEORGE COCKBURN, to the same effect, and urged the divided and uncertain responsibility of the Board, and the contradictory orders issued, he said, by the different members, who worked iD separate rooms and intermeddled with one another. He dwelt upon the evils consequent upon the constant changesat theAdmiralty, which,in hisopinion, led to much umnecessary expenditure in the dockyards. Sir CHARLS thenexplainedin detailthereforr which he considered would render the department more efficient, by simplifying the system, economizing the management, and fixing responsibility. The motion was seconded by lIr. f;NTrxNcK, who insisted that the practice of placing a civilian in the highest post at the Admiralty was anomalous and unjust. Mr. OsBornwE said the speech of Sir 0. NAPsn:R was so discuraive that it was impossible to follow him. r His chief objection to the Board of Admiralty, he remarked, seemed to be the want of permanence in the Eirst Lord, although no other head of a departmenk was permanent, and these changes were incidental to a Parliamentary governmeut, It was somewPt inconsistent, Mlr. OsOnuE observed, that Sir (9rles should in 1846 have applied for X seat at iaQ.B d of Admiralty, which he wished tO
With the exception of Mr. RoEBucx's own fervid and rather bitter harangue, there is a very observable poising of judgment and halting of opinion in all the principal speeches last night on our relations with Brazil. Lord PALMIERSTO-q him.self, MIr. DISRAELI, Lord JoiiN RUSSELL, all agree in a tone of dissatisfaction with the present state of things, and a wish to regard it as one of transition. It is, hewever, easy enough to see what the House of Commons, under their guidance, declared by a very large majority, and what it did not declare. It would not, without much graver reasons than those now alleged, respond to an appeal expressly and not very courteously made from the Government to the Legislature. It would not stop at once a course of diplomacy for which a defence could be made, or for which at least time -could be asked, by a step, which, once made, -could not be retraced. It would not do that which icould even be construed into an abrndonment of our long protest against the Slave Trade, a condemnation of ourselves, and a confession that our immense efforts and sacrifices had been made in a fruitless and Quixotic crusade. When it was not * only undeniable, but was even alleged in the arga. ment for the motion, that our trade with Brazil was such as to make her the fourth best customer on our list, and that practically she had given -up the importation of slaves, there was, at least, no case for the immediate reversal of our policy and censure of Government. /All this was evident, and Mr. ROEBUCK himself -could not have been surprised to find himself with ,only 17 followers against 312. Yet, as we have -observed, in the speeches, and not less in the great number of those who, after hearing both sides, ,declined to vote with either, we may see plainly 'what the House of Commons rtgards with dislike, and will not long continue to sauction with even a reluctant and hesitating vote. Jt will not always persist in a policy which is evidently vexatious to a iEriendly Government and people. It does not con~mplate arrogating for England to the end of time thie onerous and most thankless duty of the police of the ocean. Whatever the success of an4exceptional policy with one nation as compared with aniother, or whatever treaties or other historical reasons may be alleged, it does not like such a plain difference of dealing as may provoke the charge of national truculence and baseness made by Mlr. ROEBuJCK. There is a policy which, wise or unwise, can neither be suspected, nor even charged with making distinctions between the strong and the weak. The House of Commons would rather not have to stand on its defence against charges of this sort; and, though England has certainly proved her courage more than once within Mr. RoEBJuc's own memory, and need not be so jealous of her honour as he wishes her to be in her dealings with her own flesh and blood across the Atlantic, yet there is at least colour for the reproach that we are taking stronger measures with Brazil than with the United States. The House of Commons, then, would rather it were not so. Such a policy as ours with Brazil may be just or not, honourable or not, necessary or not; but one thing is certain,-it is a policy which must come to an end, and tho longer it is persisted in the more dangerous it is. Supposing it to be the interest of Brazil to import any number of negroes, and supposing that the Government and people of that country wish to import them, and are only preven ed by the fear of our cruisers, our courts, and our arms, then we are at least running up a very long and very deep grievance, which time and opportunity may ripen into a serious quarrel. No doubt, too, the relations of Brazil with the United States, and their community of interest as Slave Powers, are imnportant elements in the calculation of consequences. We feel ourselves bound to look to the future, whereas there are statesmen, and always have been, who feel more concerned to maintain a point of honour than to prevent future difficulties and disasters. An exceptional policy must always rest on exceptional circumstances, and the Act which forms the subject of Mr. RoEBucK's complaint is an exceptional measure, founded, of course, on our original Treaty with Brazil, but not less at variance with the policy which we have been compelled to adopt with other Powers. We have only to suppose Brazil strong enough, turbulent enough, democratic enough, or sufficiently allied with the United States, and we might some day find ourselves compelled to carry out or renounce our pretensions. At present Lord PALMrERSToN assures us the Act of 1845 is a dead letter,-a sword hung up in our armoury, and even rusting in its scabbard; but to Brazil it is a sword ready to fall, and, as we cannot help thinking Lord PALMERSTON would be the last man to recommend us to throw it away when actually challenged to the contest, so we think he woald act wisely to get rid of it, if possible, in a season of mutual confidence, respect, and repose. A preventive policy abroad is too like an obstructive policy at home. Statesmen who are always checking what they are pleased to consider bad tendencies in their own people seldom do any positive good, and the best that can be said of their administration afterwards is that under them the nation stood still. It is at least conceivable that we might bave taken some positive course on the subject of negro labour, which, without involving us with all the rest of the world, migbt have been equally effectual in the end. As it is, we have most industrioualy abstained from some simple, obvious, and most allowable measures, from a kind of philanthropic or political prudery, lest we should seem to countenance the Slave Trade. We have at last made the discovery that it is not only quite possible to introduce free Coolies inito our plantations, but that the practice can be carried on to any possible extent, and with equal benefit to the planters and the Coolies themselves. Indeed, it is hard to say which has the best of the bargain, notwithstanding a multitude of restrictions interfering alike with the profits of both parties to the contract. It remains to be proved, and certainly it requires more trial than has hitherto been allowed, whether the African cannot be introduced as freely as the Indian labourer. No doubt it would be a matter of some difficulty, and would require a special organization and police to secure for the negro his contract rights, especially that of a passage back, if he desired it. But, at the worst, the police of a few islands and one colony on the mairland against the planters themselves would not be so serious an affair as the police of the ocean against all the world; and, were the experiment to succeed, it might extinguish slavery by the natural competition of the free with the slave African. The real reason why we do not attempt so obvious an experiment is, that we are engaged in the attempt to put down slavery by stopping the supply of African blood to the New World. At present, however, that attempt has so remote and doubtful a prospect of success, and is attended with so much danger to our interests, our peace, and even our honour, that humanity itself does not forbid us to try another way of coming to the same end.
The great Neuch&tel question is settled at last. It is astonishing how long diplomatic Europe has been kept in a turmoil from so insignificant a cause as this dispute about shadows, for such it certainly was as far as Prussia was concerned. For what was the King of PIUSSIA contending? What has he given up, now that he has renounced his claims ? He has retained the title of Prince of Neuchatel, and, if an empty title can give any satisfaction to the Majesty of PRUSSiA, long may he live to wear it ! The point is unworthy of serious discussion among serious men. As long as the title represented a bond fide claim to something which could be reduced into possession, we can imagine that, however distant the chances, it would not have been lightly abandoned. Everybody knows, however, that the political and geographical boundaries of Europe forbid the possibility of any such result as the actual sovereignty of Prussia over one of the Swiss Cantons. We have all heard of PETER SCHLEIn-L, the man without a shadow; but here is the case of a shadow without a substance. Our own Sovereigns were for a long period guilty of a similar act of folly in quartering the heraldic insignia of France with the Royal arms of Great Britain. All Europe was perfectly aware that the value of the pretension vould have been overpaid by the smallest coin known in any currency in use among mankind, and the pretension was at last resigned. It would have been a more dignified coirse had the King of PRUSSs followed our example, for surely nothing can be more preposterous-nothing, if rightly considered, more humiliating, than the assertion of pretensions which cannot be made good. The real point at issue was, no doubt, the protection which FREDERICK WILLIAM extended, or supposed himself to extend, to the small faction of the Royalist p.;ty which counted as so mere a minority in the canton of Neuchatel. The real strength of the party was clearly proved on that memorable night when they " walked outinto the " lobby" with arms in their hands, and were instantly and summarily transferred to gaol by their political opponents. This state of things, however, could never last. Suppose in this country that a party which could muster but 20 on a division in the House of Commons could at any moment bring armed Europe on the baecks of the majority, it is clear enough that the will of the majority must prevail, or EnglanA eease to be an independent countny. This waa just the case ef Switzerland, all abatement beiag made for the difference in. povWsa betwei.L the three ki7*goin and the craEadene4ed ntomi There. P something1, w doubt; in the exercise of such influence iwhich was peculiarly fascinating in the eyes of tie KiNG and his intimate councillors at Berlin, The KING'S friends at Potsdam kept up active correspondence with the KmW's frieids at Neuchatel. The solicitor became the solicited. The wliole business, in fact, was as pleasing a one as could be imagined to occupy the leisure of very leisurely men as long as it could be kept in the statuts of mere diplomatic dilettantism. The KING and his advisers never seemed to reflect that unconsciously they were placing themselves pretty much in the situation of our own PRETENDER. But what a difference between the pretensions of the wandering, houseless STuAnT, and those of the actual Sovereign of one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe ! The moment, however, the King of PRlussIA in this Neuchatel affair abandoned the position of a dreamer for that of an actual belligerent he became a mere Filibuster in place of a savant. We can conceive few political possibilities which would have been so condemned by the universal opinion of the civilized world as that the King of Pnussiu should have Eghted the torch of war, and set Europe once more in a flame-Europe stiUl bleeding from the unscarred wounds of the Russian war-and upon so petty a quarrel as this. The nation which would have had the most right to complain-after the Swiss Cantons-would have been the people of Prussia. They have no more concern with their KINO's visionary claims upon Uhe Canton of Neu chatel than the English people would have with any imaginary claims of the House of BnuNswicx upon a German Principality. The Neuchatel Principality was a heirloom in the Royal family, like a gold snnffbox or a Japanese cabinet. It might be more correct to say it was the " family ghost." Why should any Prussian subject have been taxed one thaler; ,why should the son of anyPrussi2n mother have been slaughtexcd in the vindication of a claim with which the nation had no earthly concern ? We were, however, within a day or two of this pitiable result. The Swiss gave way just at the critical moment, or the orders for the mobilization of tle troops and for letting loose the dogs of war would have gone forth. We wiqh that it was in our power to compliment the Prussian Km-G more heartily upon his tardy acquiescence in a saner policy. He has done the right thing at last, but he has been very long in doing it. It must have been obvious to FREDERIOK WThLIAX long since that this Swiss Canton was lost for ever to him and his, and had he coolly considered the matter he should have rejoiced at the conclusion. Worse than Irish property to the mortgagorworse than a sugar estate in later days to the West Indian proprietor, was this miserable Swiss Canton to the Monarch of that distant Sovereignty. How happy a day was it for England when she got free of the incubus of Hanover I end yet Hanover was a reality, not a dream. We do not speak as yet with perfect certainty, but we trust our present impression may be the true one, which is that the King of PRUSSu has not insis'ed upon any indemnity. This would be a graceful and dignified act, which might at the last mnoment conciliate to him in some degree the -public opinion of Europe. There was something so degrading-the relative position of the parties being taken into account-in this miserable haggling about a few thousands of francs more or less, that one could scarcely imagine the Prussian negotiators to have been in earnest. Let the resignation of this Royal bauble be handsomely and royally made. The Canton of Neuchatel has been practically independent for years; for years it has been a member of the Confederated Cantons of Switzerland. The Prussian KING resigns nothing for which he has a right to claim one fraction in the way of indemnity. The whole imbroglio has arisen from a blunder made at the Congress of Vienna, when the independence of the Canton should have been acknowledged in a diplomatic and regular way. The famous year of 1848, however, repaired the blunder as far as NeuchAtel was concerned, and we must always regret that the Ministers of the Great Powers-Lord MAlImESBURY being one -should ever have signed a Note calculated to put the question once more in issue. There, however, is an end of the matter. We congratulate our readers, and the public of Europe generally, that they may henceforward leave the Nench1telois to make their clocks in peame, or, if they think of them at all, that it need simply be in connexion with a summer tonr through the Canton. The non-litigant negotiators at Paris deserve some praise for the pe,tience and endurance they have displayed in the discussion of this wearisome affair. Henceforward the Neuchatel question may be considered as blotted out of the page of contemporary history.
If any impediment really obstructed or delayed the circulation of the Report on Military Education, we can only trust the circumstance may be found practically conducive to the special notoriety of the document in question, for seldom have the conclusions of a Commission deserved more consideration at the hands of the public. The duty immediately assigned to the Commissioners was that of "' considering the best mode of re- "organizing the system for training officers "for the Scientific Corps"`-i.e., the Artilery and the Engineers ; but, as their instructions authorized them also to report "aaU such observations and " facts as might appear to them of importance " with reference to Military Education," the latitude of action acquired was practically very considerable, and the country is now getting the benefit of their travels and their labours in a volume of extreme value as regards the education of the whole army. If it was desirable, as we do not doubt, that the excellence of our Artillery and Engineer services sbould be stimulated by greater opportunities of improvement, it was certainly no less so that the standard of professional acquirements should be raised in all other departments, and particularly in that from which the entire machine receives its direction and impnlse. We speak of the Staff, and nobody can weU allege that the point has been mooted either too soon or without occasion, for even in the most conservative quarters it is admitted that here, more than anywhere, is the work of reform urgently needed, and here will its consequences exert the greatest influence on our military power. The " Staff" of an army, as most readers will recollect from the details of the Crimean campaigns, includes aU those officers whose duties are connected with the organization, lodging, and manceuvring of the force in the field. The several regiments composing the army have officers of their own, with duties confired to their respective battalions, but the machinery required for moving or establishing several chief divisions or the whole body together is supplied by the Staff. Of course, the abilities demanded for the effective discharge of such functions are of a higher order than those needed in the case of regimental officers, and it is equally obvious that auy defective standard of merit in this department must be attended with results of proportionate importance. At the same time, however, that the obligations incumbent on the Staff are so serious, the advantages of the position are no less remarhable. A Staff officer esoapes many of the oppressive and unjmuneraiive hardships of routine duty; he is i4 ieceipt of larger emoluments than his bie ,<renu im. te Inue, aud lhe enjoys greatez opportunities of professional distinction, Ia I loth these respects, therefore, is it fitting that special proofs of excellence should be exacted from hinm, for he is charged with functions of pe.culiar importance, and is recompensed by peculer consideration. In a few words we may say, that what the Scientific Corps are to other regiments Staff officers are, or should be, to other officers. The opinions and practice of foreign countries on this head may be very brielly and emphatically described from the :Report of the Commissioners. Wherever they went they found in full and vigorous operation an institution termed a "Staff " School," through which alone was any access to Staff appointments to be obtained. "I n every "foreign country," they observe, " the entrance "to the Staff School is gained by competition; in "all these schools the education is slid and "extensive, ana everywhere the pupil's entrance "to the Staff is gained by his distinctionz at the "school." Nothing can be more complete, forcible, or impressive than this deduetion. The system, again, which has been puzsued in England can be also depicted in colours leaving a plain and perspicuous contrast. The only seminary resembling a Staff School in this country is the " Senior Department" at Sandhurst. Of the efficiency of this institution we shall have said enough when we observe, that of late years " the whole instruction has been in the hands of "two, indeed it may be almost said of one, "Professor," while for the Staff School in France "thirteen military and five civil Professors" are maintained. On its practical operation in providing the army with officers of the stamp required we need only quote the remark of the Commissioners, that " out of 216 officers "who have received certificates at the Senior "Department of Sandhurst since 1836 only 15 "were employed on the Staff in May, 1854." The long and short of the matter is, that there were few opportunit-es of instruction at an officee's command, aud that even where these were turned to account there was no certainty of any corresponding reward. " Entrance to the Staff," which even uinder the absolute institutions of the Continent is opened to merit only, in free England is left to depend upon favour, interest, connexion, or anything, in short, rather than professional excellence. The system recommended by the Commissioners in preference to that heretofore adopted consists in first providing for a somewhat higher standard of acquirements in the general body of officers, and then opening a Staff School, or Senior Department, to those who may be induced to study the higher branches of their profession. The entrance to this school should be strictly competitive-that is to say, it should depend not upon any positive amount of producible knowledge, but upon the comparative proficiency or promise of the candidates presenting themselves. After the prescribed course has been completed departure from the school should be regulated according to an order of merit, ascertained not by the results of a single final examination, but by the aggregate evidence procurable from the student's whole career in the establishment. If these principles were observed, we believe the Austrian Staff would soon lose its title to be considered the "best in existence." Englishmen are at least as apt in such matters as other nations; all that is wanted is the certainty of recompense for exertion-a fair field and no favour. We are thoroughly convinced that in the organization of this department the principle of competition is indispensable to success. For regimental commissions it may be sufficient to exact proof of a sound liberal education; but for Staff officers we want not only good candidates, but the very best which the country can furnish. No man is "good enough" for these appointments if there is auother still better. The mere adoption of a certain standard of merit, though it may be a necessary expedient in some cases, would be an injudicious scheme where the highest attainable excellence was imperatively required, and where temptations to partiality were necessarily strong. What the service requires for the Staff, and what the country wishes to see, is the appointment and the promotion of the best men who can be found. The Staff deserves its distinctions of pay and privilege, for the responsibility of its members is great in proportion, but the bargain should be even on both sides. The merit should be proved before it is rewarded, and the excellence of the officer ascertained before its recompense is forthcoming.

A FEARFuL Lruy.-The Niagara FaUs Gazette says that a Mrs. Ilynn, wife of a labourer, lately jumped over the bank of the Niagara river, just below the Hydraulic Canal. She apparently stuck in the top of a tree, after a descent of about 100 feet, and fell from there to the bottom. When she left home she kissed her children, bade them good-bye, and told them to inform L-. Flynn that he would see her no more: When found she was sitting very composedly, cogitating, doubtless, on the uncertainty of human calculations, especially when predicated on untried experiments. She was considerably bruised and scratched, but not much more than frequently happens in an ordinary shindy. Intoxication has been assigned as the cause of the act, but this is uncertain. THE GOVERwENY T OF CEYLoN.-Yesterday was published a copy of a letter, dated the 17th of last January, addressed by Viscount Torrington to the Colonial Office, on his administrahon of the Government of Ceylon, wifh reference to the remarks of Governor Sir IL G. Ward on the subject, together with the reply of Mr. Labouchere, dated the 11th of February following. Mr. Labouchere replied to the effect that he did not think it would be a proper or convenient course to express any general opinion on the merits of Lord Torrington's administration; and he felt it the less incumbent upon him so to do, because he (Mr. Labouchere) was persuaded that it was not Sir Henry Ward's intention to cast any imputation upon his Lordshis Government; but on the contrary, to declare that, in his opinion, the prosperity now enjoyed by the island of v o is in great part to be attributed to able and vigorousmeasures adopted by his Lordship and Sir George Anderson, under very difficult circamstances, is order to place the finances of the colony on a sound foadation. NARROW EsOApp.-Mr. Penrose, of Trevorria3, in the parieh of Sancreed, recently sent a bag of wheat to Nancothan Mill, a short distance from that. estate, but-in the parish of Madron. Mr. Pool, of Nancotban, has been in the habit of clearing out his mill on Saturdays, laing poison for rats, and clearing away the poison on Mondays. Mr. Penrose's wheat was the first to be gound on Monday 'week, and, as the top of his sack was afterwards stroegly impregnated with arsenic, while tk& bottom was very slightly so, it is presumed that arseniew4sleft in t}shoopper. The man (a new hand) who was tsP to clean the rn on Monday morning has been discharged for carele3sness. The deadly sack was taken to Trevcrimi, and on Tuesday the first lot of flour was converted into a padding for dinner. Mlr. Penrose, jun., was from home, and his wife beimg. in delicate health did not pahTalce of the pudding. After dinner all were seized with -.nausea and sickness, vhich was not improved by the next meal, tea, when a loaf from the same flour was eaten by she whole family, including Mrs. Penrose. AU night the family were in a dreadful state, and on Wednesday mo-mning Mr. J. R. Quick, of Penzaoce, surgeon, was sent for, who found it necessary to prescribe remedies. Up to last night two members of the family were tillsufferingseverelv, Mr. Penrose,sen.,ismuchswollen, and the two women ex-p,rience great pain and are still weak. Portions of the p- addinz, bread, and flour have been analyzed by Dr. J.. B. Moitgomery, of this town.

In February Brano learnt that Rosalie vwas boat. to retun to Moctpelier,.and. he went several consecutive.. das to the diligence-office to await her arrival. On the 294th she arrived, and he wanted to embrace her, but sho repelled him. He, however, persisted in accompanying her to the house of-hersister, a married woman, where she wa going to spend afew days. Aived there, he asked her to shake him by the hand, bat she refused, and he seemedt deeply offeuded.

BOBEIGN INTELLIGENCE. EALU19. (FROM OUR OW1N COORREOND=T.) ITbe foUowing appeard in our second ediMon of yesA?daav -1 pARD13, WnnN5DAY, MAZ 27, 6 P.M. Asyou havebeen already informed, the treatywhioh definitively settles the Neuchditel question was signed last evening, at half-p. t 6 o'clock. The King of Prussia formally renouxmzs the rights of sovereignty " which," says the Moniteut;, " treaties bad given him over that Principality." The point on which the Plenipotentiaries were occupied both yesterday andMonday related to the mnillion indennty claimed by Prussia, and resisted by Switzerland. NI. Walewski contended that the draught of the treaty should comprise the indemnity article, and that the King, on obtaining the recognition of his claim, should then graciously decline it. Tn this view he was supported by M. de Hatzfeldt. Dr. Kern, the Swiss Plenipotentiary, did not, however, think that the King should be thus allowed an occasion of exhibiting himselfas magnanimous and disintere2ted at the expense of the dignity of the Confederation, and he maintained that if His Prussian Majesty did not really mean to take the money there must be no mention made of it in the treaty, and the 6th Article, which related to it, must disappear alto- ether. In this businesslike view of the matter Fr. Kern was supported by Lord Cowley. The point was under discussion two days, and was, I understand, at last decided in favour of Switzerland. The caution of Dr. Kern is commendable. There has been nothing in the conduct of the King of Prussia throughout this affair to induce any one to place implicit confidence in his assurances. This little point is in the Neuchd.tel afihir pretty much what the difficulty about Boigrad was in the Russian treaty. The Mloniteur announces the conclusion in these terms: "The Plenipotentiaries of France, Austria, GreatBritain Prussia, Russia, and Switzerland assembled yesterday at the Mhinistry for Foreign Affairs, and signed a treaty rogu. lating in a definitive manner the NeachAtel question by the renunciation on the part of the King of Prussia of the sovereign rights which treaties had given him over that Princi. pality, and by engagements entered into by the Swviss Confederation, which are of a nature to respond to the deep icitude of King Frederick William for the inhabitants of NeuchAtel. The text of the treaty will be published after the exchange of the ratifications, which is to take place withln a delay of 21 days." It is said that, in consequence of the intervention of the French Ambassdor at Constantinople, the Moldavian and Wallachian refugees, who had been stopped at Rustchuk, have been permitted to return to their native country. The project of law on the Bank of France, which the Commission of the Legislative Body had resolved to reject unless the amendments it proposed were accepted, is now certain to pass, the Commission having considerably modified its opposition. Had it not done so the Chamber would have thrown its own Comrnission overboard. This does not mean, however, that the Deputies approved the project; it means that at this moment the Chamber Wil vote anything the Government thinks proper to propose. It is on the eve of dissolution, and the Deputies have no notion of exposing themselves to the chances of not being accepted as Governmont candidates by any show of independence. The eagerness with which certain high functionaries are thrasting the project down the throat of the Commission justifies the suspicion that some personal interest is at stake. M. Parieu, Vice-President of the Council of State, is no longer spoken of as the future (Governor of the Bank. M. Magne, Minister of Finance, is the person now mentioned as more likely to be the successor of Count d'Argout. The Emperor and the King of Bavaria went in State last night to the French Opera. They were accompanied by the Empress, the Grand Duchess of Baden, Prince Napoleon, the Princess Mathilde, and the principal functionaries-male and femalebelonging to the household. The Rue Lepelletier was illuminated, and strewn with sand, and the facade of the theatre was gaily decked out with flags-the tricolour of France and the white and blue of Bavaria. Detachments of the Gendarmes of the Imperial Guard were drawn up under the peristyle of the theatre, and formed a double line on the staircase leading to the Emperor's box. The box was richly lined and hung with velvet and gold. A numerous concourse of persons collected on the Boulevards and the sidepaths of the Rue Lepelletier, and waited patiently for more than an hour to see the party. It was nearly 9 o'clock when the corttge arrived. Four lmperial carriages first made their appearance, containing the attendants of the Princes, and after a short interval the State carriages, five in number, brought their Majesties and their Highnesses to the spot. They were preceded by outriders and a party of the Cent Garde, and were followed by the remainder of the squadron. Opposite the Opera is the now eatinghouse well known as the " Diners de Paris," and belonging to the Societ6 Gastronomique. It is famed, it seems, for good living, and I believe also for the best beer that can be had in Paris. From the balconies of this eatablishment shot suddenly forth a most brilliant Bengal light,which glared with almost intolerable brightness on the entrance of the Opera and the houses in front. It was an unusual circumstance, and produced a fine effect. But the display was premature, and the first four carriages, which contained only the attendants, were evidently mistaken for those in which the King and Emperor rode, so that the light was out when the great: personages made their appearance. We are idformed by Mr. M'Culloch (Geogrphical Dlictiowy) that with the worthy burgesses of Mlunich " eating and drinking consttute the chief business of life," and that "Bavaria certainly would appear to be the Paradise of beer-drinkers." The display of Bengal fire last night may be taken, I presume, as a delicate compliment to the national partialities of the Bavarian people and, in truith, by none could it more appropriately be offered than by an establishment so renowned for good cheer as the Societ6 Gastronomique. It is to be hoped the King felt the full force of the honour, and appreciated it accordingly. Hlis Majesty received the members of the Diplomatic Corps to-dayinhis apartments at the Tuileries. The reception lasted more than an hour. He chatted with them in a very friendly manner, and spoke with each (except the Persian and Turkdsh Ambassadors) in his own tongue. This attention produced a favourable effect.

Smny SPAIN. (EmoM OUR O'WN COnnmrPONDMq.) MADRID, MAY 23. The debate in the Senate continued yeaterday in much the same tone as before-a tone, that is to say, of personality and recrimination. The President, the Tarquis de Viluma, made an attempt, early in the sitting, to check the pugnacious prolixity of the Senators, who, when they rise to explain, or to repel some allusion to themselves, are in the habit of making long speeohes upon all sorts of subjects quite remote from tlat upon which, according to the regulations of the Chamber they are alone entitled to speak. Generals dons and O'Donnell, succesively caled to order for departing fromthe quesion, succedively sat down, renouncing their righit to speak, and evidently much iritated. If t his had gone on, it wold, of cours, have been said that the President was fibVOUring the GIovernment, and trying to nave it from attack.. Accordingly, when Genera ROE do Ola;no rose and declared that, if compeLled to conffne himself to replying to a personal ruslon? it would be impossible for him to say what he wished to ssy, and re- quested the President and the Senate to consider the circumstances of the case and the magnitude of the question, it was decided that he should be allowed to speak his fRll,-a very rash permission to concede to so flowery and lachrymlose an orator. Fortunately, his feelings overpowered him before his subject was exhausted, and he sat down, after defining the Vicalvarist fraction as " conservatives of the conquests made by the revolution and sanctioned bythe Crown." After a very discursive oration from General Concha, in which he energeticaly attacked the Government, General O'Donnell rose and made a powerfnl speech, in which he handled Senor Pida} very roughly, convicting him of gross inconsistency, and leaving hima not a leg to stand upon. Stung to the quick, the Minister of State struggled hard, but in vain, to extricate himself from his labyrinth of selfcontradictions . These prolonged dissensions in the Senate, and the bad blood they generate, are looked upon with eatisfaction by the Lberal party, who see an increase of their own strength in the division of their enemies, and with uneasiness by the Palace, which would fain witness the consolidation of an ultraConservative Ministry, and will certainly not have recourse to O'Donnell save at the very last extremity. The Bravo Murillo party is strong in the Ctongress, and thiere are reports of its intended opposition to Glovernmnent, and of probably important dlebates in the Lowfer Chamber. Nt was hoped that the opening of the Chambers would clear up the situation a little, but as yet-and they have now sat for three weeks-it seems but to have rendered confusion worse confounded. The Congress bas done literally nothing, and the whole time of the Senate has been wasted in tedious formalities and undignified squabbles. On the 12th June are to be sold, in the Calle de los Manueles, Cordova, a collection of 1.'5 pictures, belonging to the estate of the deceased Don Diego Monroy y hguilera, honorary painter to the Queen, director of a provincil galery, and of an aeademy of drawing. A detailed catalogue of the pictures has been published in the Madrid Gazette, with prices annexed, for less than which it is stated that they will not be sold. Few of the prices are very high. An Infant Jesus Sleeping on the Cross, one hand resting on a skull, with angels around, described as an undoubted MuriUlo, is valued at 40,000 reals, rather more than 4001.; a San Geronimo on his knees, adoring a crucifix, by Hemlin, is valued at 6001.; a Santa Clara, said to be a Murillo, 1151. The Three per Cents. were done at 40.5; ditto, Deferred, 25.85.
RAILWAY IYTBLZIGENCE. WATERFORD AND =XRN1tv- The balf-yearly meeting of this company was held yester. day at the London Tavern, the Earl of Bessborough in the ghair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in Tte Times, was read by the secretary. The CHAiM AI, in moving the adoption of the report, said the directors regretted that they were not able to prow sent v. more satisfactory statement. They were anxous that the shareholders should know everything with regard to their affairs. The board had nothing to conceal, and It was evident on the present occasion that they were not in a position to declare any dividend. Theyfound itvery difficult to get out their debentures, for the purpose of paying off some of the money borrowedfrom the Loan Commissioners. They were at present in negotiation with the commissioners, and he hop they would arrive at a satisfactory result. They had powers to raise sufficient capital for the purposes of t e company. After charging everything against revenue that could fairly be charged, it would he seen that they worked the line at a profit; and every week their traffio showed an increase. From a etatement prepared by Mr. Cotton, their manager, it appeared that the recelpts on the line for the past eigh t weeks amounted to 2,n3L, and for the corresponding period of I856 to 2,3391., showing an in. crease of 3741., or 117 per cent. The traffic was certainly note nal to the expectations formed of it by sanguine shareiolders, but he, being acquainted with the district, thought they could not expect a very large traffio from it. The Altord steamersto Waterford were doing very well for themselves, but he thought they had not done the traffie on their railway much good. The Kilkenny people should pass over their line and use thelr boats; they would find it a very cheap conveyance for goods and passengers to and from England. Mr. PoiN-R seconded the motlon for the adoptlon of the report. In reply to a question from Mr. Craddock and other shareholders, it was stated that during the past siX months the Great Southern and Western Company bad had a dispute with the Waterford and Limeriok Railway Company respecting the traffic, and the result was that the former company had conveyed the Kilkenny traffic to EnRland, vi4 Dublin and Liverpool, at a very low rate. The Water ford and Ki]kenny Company found it necessary to reduce their rates, but now that competition, which lased four months, was at an end. The expenditure on capital account during last year amounted to 33,OOOL, and nealy the whole of the lne had been relWid. It was probable that about 4,0001. would now complete all the works. Mr. RICHARtSON considered the locomotive exoere very high, and that they were capable of being much reduced. Mr. Powxn said they workea the goods and passenger traffic together, and the gradients were bad, but they would shortly work the goods and passenger traffic separately, which they hoped would prove satisfactory. Resolutions were passed adopting the report, authorizing the conversion of shares into stock, re-electing the retiring directors and auditor, and confirndng the forfeiture of 137 shares for nonpeuent of calls. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. LONDON AND BLACKWALL. An award has just been made by the Recorder in the appeal on the part of the parish of St. Olave, by which the assdssment on the railway has been redueed from 1,6001 as the estimated value, and .,0001. as the net rateable value; to 4401 The Earish has to pay the whole of the costs of the treferenceaeo award.

I MfOY:Y-ZMA RgTaTCITYINTBIG.B9OR. Thursday Evening. The funds opened steadily this morning at the unProved prices of yesterday and subsequently experiencee a fresh advance, but the telegraphic announcement from China of a further rise of nearly 5 per cent. in the value of dollars at Shanghai caused several speculative sales to be made, and the market closed at a reaction. The favourable influences in Operation during the morning were the satisfactory state of the weather for the crops of all descriptions and the tendency to an influx of gold at the Bank, notwithstanding the extraordinary delay in the supplies from Australia. Consols for money were fint quoted 93;l to 94, and after havin- touched 94~ they receded to 931 to J for money, ani 93* to 94 for the 4th of June. For the new account on the 9th of July the last transactions were at 94k to I (or 93 to i ex dividend). Bank Stock left oif at 212 to 214- Reduced, 92X; New Three per Cents., 92i-; india Stock, 220 to 222; India Bonds, 7s. to 4s. discount; iExchequer Bonds, 98k to 99; and Exchequer-bills, June, 2s. to 4s. premiumn; March, 4s. to 7s. premium. There was an increased d'emand for loans in th Stock-Exchange to-day, and the rate was 6i per cent. The discount-market was also active. Foreign securities exhibited firmness, but there was less animation in the later hours. Transactions In Turkish Six per Cents., for money, took place at 9O and i; for the account, 95k and #; the our per Cents. Guaranteed, for money, at IOIl; and for the account, at 101g. The general business compred-Brazilian, 1004 and ; Rothschild's Four. and-a-Hialf per Cents., 1852, 99k and 98k; Chilian Six per Cents., 101* and 102L-; Mexican, for account, 22 and 23i; Portugeae eThree per Cents, 45H and 46 ; Russi4n Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97 and ; Spanish Three per Cents., for money, 42 ; for the account, 41i andiur; the New Deferred, for account, 25k; Passive, 5*; Spanish Certificates of Coupon, not funded, 6*-; Venezuela for account, 36k- and ; and Dutch Two-and-a-half per Cents., 6Xk. The final quotation of the Flrench Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. lOc. for both money and account, showing another decline of nearly a quarter per cent. About 90,0001. in Australian gold was sold to the Bank to-day. It seemed probable that a small portion of the Rus4ian gold just arrived would also be taken there, but the accounts from China may now perhaps cause the whole to be bought for the continent. The exact total overdue from Australia is 730,0001. The telegraphic quotatlons of the rates of exchange from China to-day show no alteration at Hongkong, but an advance of 5 per cent. at Shanghai,-the rate,which was 6s. lld. to 7s. by the last packet, being now 7s. 3d. to 7a. 4d. This must give anotherpowerful inmpulse to the shipment of silver, and the packet of the 4th of June will take outprobably from 700,0001. to 1I000,0001., the only limit to the quantity for the moment being the supplies available within the period and the extent to which insurances can be effected. Dollars were eagerly sought during the afternoon, and an advance of id. per ounce was demanded. On the other hand, the exchanges from Bombay and Calcutta are again less unfavourable for this country. At Bombay the rate was 2s. lid., and at Calcutta 2s. Id. 11-16 to -id., ahowing in each case a decline of about i to J per cent. Some weeks back attention was called to a disclosure in the Sydney newspapers of a method by which the London underwriters were liable to be defrauded. It appeared from a letter inserted in the Sydney Rerald that instances had occurred w;here the consignees of certain descriptions of unmarketable goods contrived to get them certified as damaged by sea water, so as to enable the shippers to come upon the underwrriters for the diÃ¯Â¿Â½ference between their nominal and realized value. Subsequent advices mention that an action having been broulght against the author of the letter by an importing firm who considered themselves aggrieved, a verdict was returned for the defendant. The evidence at the trial plainly sholwed that the certificates in question were obtained and acted upon in the most lax manner, and the Sydney Herald upon a review of the caue naturally expresses surprise at the indifference shown by the underwriters in not establishing some effective system for their own protection. 1f such things are tolerated the losses must be heavy, and these cannot be met except by an indiscriminate increase in the scale of prermiums and a consequent injury to the legitimate trader. By the last mail from China copies were received of an interesting correspondence between the principal American firms at Canton and Commodore Armstrong, the commander of the United State' squadron. The American merchants app]ied to the Commodore to take measures for protecting the American traffic between Macao and Hongkong. The Commodore pleaded that he had not sufficient force, and that as Great Bri' in and Portugal occupied the termini of the route they would doubtless guard it from all risks, while, at the same time, the United States would thus escape the possibility of their neutrality being endangered. The merchants evidently thought it neither fair nor dignified that the responsibility of protecting them should be thrown upon other Powers, and rejoined that they were " not aware of any written international law or treaties that place the Chinese waters between Hongkong and a n extent of upwards of 30 miles-under the British or Portuguese Governments." Upon this the Commodore hastened to disavow the inference that he had intended to imply the existence of any jurisdiction of the British and Portuguese over any Chinese waters, but abstained from entering again into the general points of the question. The correspondence therefore terminated, and the American merchants forthwith transmitted a copy of it to Dr. Parker, the United States' Minister at Macao,reqnesting that it might be viewed as a protest against the course adopted by the Commodore in leaving American interests to the care of the British. They likewiSe complained of the total inattention shown to all their representations for a period of 13 years, and pointed out that although America has a commerce with Ohina nearly equal to that of Englaud, and far beyond any other nation, her citizens have "almost invariably been indebted to the forces of Great Britain for the protection of themselves and their property," and that it is to these forces also that they have chiefly to attribute the suppression of piracy on the coasts. Finally they add,-" It is worthy of note, that while the British have during the past 12 years published surveys of the whole coast of China, we are not aware of a single contribution of the same character from the American navy, although Commodore Perry surveyed the new ports of Japan and Formosa." The document was signed by Mlessrs. Augustine Heard and Co., Messrs. King and Co., and Messs Russell and Co., and the Minister promised that it should have his attention, and that it should be transmitted to Washington. A new patent for an improved method of maling bread is about to be tested on an extensive scale in the course of a few days by Messrs. Carr and Co., of Carlisle. Iitherto in the manufacture of bread the dough has sometimes been made by mixin flour insa closed vessel with water chargedwith carbonie aid, an the present invention, which is byDr. Dauglish, of Great Malvern, consists ia compressing the air in the vessel in which tho flour is contained before admitting the water charged with gas, so as to prevent the escape of the gas before the process of ming or kneading is completed. It is said that the bread can thus be made with perfect precision of any degree of lightness, and that, owng to the avoidance of the waste consequent upon the chymical changes which take place during the process of fermentation, an economy of 10 per cent. will be effected. A resolution was passed this morning at the Bank Court associating Mr. Henry rshfeld with Mr. Charles Freshfield in the appointment of solicitors to the Bank of England, the latter having held the appointment jointly with the late Mr. James Fresh. field, jun., for the last 17 years. In their circular announcing the death of their brother Meesr. Freshfleld state*. " With A view t, supply as far as pessible the loss ms. talned by this event, we have made arrangements for taking into partnershp his eldest son, Mr. W ilh n DAes FPreshfield, and Mr. G. G. Newman, of whom both have been brought up in our of1ioe, and the latter hwsheld a posision of great trust in it forsome yrs." At the annual meeting of the Ionian Bank held today, Mr. 0. Farrerpreuidlng, the reportand accounts were unanmously adopted. The dividends lately paidhave been at thb rate of 5 per cent. per annum, and the establishment having surmounted all the xererdsince 18S1, it iped for 1855 amounted to 6,4341., and for the twelve months ending De~eember last they 'were 9,I37l1. The total, in fact, was 2,0001. larger, but an old debt equal to that sum has been written off. The reports of the crops are favourable, and the supply of currants is again becomimg abundlart. Complaints, nevertheless, are made of the inequality of the dutv levied, e5pecially as a further reduction in the Ameran tariff is to take effect on the 1st of July. It is urged that the consumption in this country would be greatly augmented if a lower rate were conceded, and that it is scarcely justice to fix a dutyoncurrants from a qTasi British dependency at 15s. 9d. per cwt. while that on raisins, the produce of a foreign country, is 10s. Annexed is an abstract ot the report:- "The directors have satisfaction in being able again to address the proprietors in langage of congratulation. The favourable anticipations which they ventured, with some qualification, to hold out have been faUy reaized, and they can now look forward with reasonable confidence to a period of prosperous activity. The destructive blight which for some years past has exercised so disstrous an influence, if not altogether subdued, has been at least materially checked, and, with the help of those preventive and remedial measures of which experience has demonstrated the efficacy, there is ground for hope that it wil shortly disappear. The crop of the year 1856 was of average aantity and more than average quality, and, as the sappy came upon au exhausted market, the proprietors and cultivators were able to obtain for their fruit amply remunerative prices. The effect of this has, of course, been felt in other branches oE trade and industry, and the Bank has not 'failed to participate in the improvement, to which, indeed, it has in no Inconsiderable degree contributed. It is not too much to say that the steady action of the Bank during the critical neriod now happily past, the union of liberality, forbearace, and prudent reserve which it ezhibited, greatly mitigated the severity of the consequent pressure, and must havo sill further strengthened the confidence of the Ionian people inits stability and sefulness. The evidences, indeed, ofthisconfidencearenotwanting. lathe circulation,deposits, and discountsthere hasbeen a sensibleincrease, and inasmuch asthereremains for the future nothingmorethantheordinary contingencies incidental to banking operations, and as the judicious husbandry of the resources of the bank enables it to take advantage of the more active and profitable demand which has lately sprung up, the directors anticipate a progressive augrentation of profit. Times of prosperous reaction, however,are not withoat theirperils, and the directors will not fail to impress on their gers a continuance of that vigilant caution which, indeed, their owrn matured experience would kpontaneoualy suggest. They subjoin the usual abstract of the results of the year 1856, which, as showing an addition to the rest of 2,17TI., they trust will be received as satisfactory: The balance to the credit of profit and loa on Januay I,18, wag.

CAMfPBELL'S DIrOwCE. HOUSE OF LORDS. mA SR. bsieir LordsNis resumed the hearing of the evidence on beafofMs Campbell in opposition to the bill this after. noon at 2 o'clock. Mr. MACQUEEN said he held in his hand a report of the decision of Dr. Lushington in this case, which showed distinctly the difference between the rule of the ecolesiastical courts and that of the House with regard to condonance. In the ecclesiastical courts nothing but absolute connubial intercourse was regarded as condonance, whereas it had been decided in their Lordships' House in 188, in " Parry's case," that offering a 'wife 2001. per annum if she would give up the adulterous intercourse barred any application for a divorce. He (UIr. Macqueen) only wished to show that there need not be absolute connubial intercourse to prove condonance, He also submitted that the BiUought to have set out the marriage settlement of Mrs. Campbell, as great injustice might otherwise be done her. The LORD CANeCELLO, said the BiUl could be amended so far, but that would do at another time. Mr. WYLDE said the marriage settlement was in Australia, but he had a copy of it, which he would hand to their Lordships. The following witnesses were then called O.h Mr. FeniWaAle.-I know tho parties before the House. I am the proprietor of the Colonnade Hotel, St. James's. I recollect Mrs. Campbell coming to my house--then my father's-on the 24th of June. She came with Captain Russel, her uncle. She engaged a bed and sitting-room, and Captain Russel also had a bedroom. They remained until the 2d of July. Mrs. Campbell then went to Boulogne. She ret"irned to my house on the 13th of July. During the first period she stayed at my house Mr. CampbeU did not come to see her. When she returned her maid came with her. The second time Mrs. Campbell had only one room, which had a bed in it. The followLeg day Mr. CamDbell came. He took me up into her room and stated that 'ie would not pay any debts which she might incur. He said she was a bad woman. She seemed affected. It was a painful scene to witness. I could not say whether he treated her with harshness. A lr. Wiliam Russel was in the room. We only stayed a few minutes in the room. There was a gentleman named Dobee in the house, and, in consequence of what he said to Mr. Campbell, I returned to Mrs. Campbell, and she told me she would pay the debts which she might incur. Mr. Campbell then went upstairs and said that he had reconsidered his opinion, and that he would pay her debts. He wanted to shake hands with her. She refused doing so, and said shb did not wish to Bhake hands, and that she would pay her own debts. His manner wasmilderandkinder. Hedidnot attenipt to kiss her. That was all that passed between them to my knowledge. I believe he went up to her again, but I did not see himu go up. Mr. Campbell brought the children on the 19th of July. He took them up into her room. There were two boys. He said that he was going to take them up into her room. I cannot say how long they remained. Alr. Campbell came to the hotel every day from the 13th to the 19th of July. On that day I saw Mr. Campbell put Mrs. CampbeU and her attendant into a cab and give directions to the cabman. I did not see him get into the cab. He had often stayedI the whole day with Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. CampbeU had a scrvant named Ann Lowman. Ann Lowman is now in Sydney. She attended upon Mrs. Campbell. Mrs. CampbeUl never had either wines, spirits, or malt liquors during her stay in my house. There was a sofa in the room as well as abed. I am certain Ann Lowman is in Australia. The children went with Mr. Russel. In my evidence before the ecclesiastical court I said Mra. Campbell was " flighty." I meant by that that she was excited when Mr. CampbeU said he should not pay her debts. A medical gentleman came to see Mm CampbeU when she was ill Cross-examined.-She was ill between the 13th and the 19th of July. Mr. CampbeU came to meet the medical gentleman. Mr. Campbell used to go upstairs to Mrs. Cam 1bel's room. Mr. Russel was not always with them on thse occasions. The children did not go with Mrs. Campbell. le-exanxined.-Mr. Campbell used to appoint to meet the medical man at my house. He used to breakfast in the coffeerooni. Mary Agar.-I am the mother of Mary Ann Agar. I knew Mr. and Mrs. Cam pbell. My daughter was to be married in Australia at Christmas. Mary Ann Agar was directed to watch Mrs. CampbeU and write to Mr. CampbelL He discharged her because she would not teU tales about the mistress. I called at the Colonnade Hotel for .Mary Ann's clothes. I knocked at the door and I was told to come ii. That was at 10 in the morning. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were in the bedroomi alone. hlr. Campbel was very angry indeed, and sdid, " Go on, good woman," and turned me out of the room. There was not a soul inthe room but themselves. I wentso earlyin order not to see xr. Campbell. 1 went again, and saw Mr. Campbell there. I asked Mrs. Campbell for a character for Mary Ann. She began to write it, when Mr. Campbell snatched it out of her hands, and turned nie out of the room. Mrs. Campbell was qiiite capablo of giving the character. She was very steady. Mr. Campbell was very rough. Cross-cxamined.-I can't teU when I first told this story. I told my landlady and my daughter when I got home. I don't recoUect telling anybody else. Mr. CampbeUl came to me once. No gentleman camo about this case to me. Mr. Matthew, the solicitor for Mr. Campbell, said if I would favour Mr. Campbell he would pay me handsomely. Mr. Matthew came without Mr. Campbell. A gentleman did therefore, come to me. He came about the addresses of my daughters. I said I would " do so" if he paid me the girls' wages. I did not say if he would give me 601. to pay the girls' passage to Australia I could give as much evidence as they couid, and that I was wiUing to give it. I refused to give their addresses unless he paid their wages. Their wages amounted to 501. Mr. Matthew said he would give me 5s. per day. I don't know what Mr. Matthews wanted nme to do. I did not tell him what evidence I could give. I will not swear anything anybody asks me to swear to. I wonder you should ask me such a thing. When I went to the hotel Mr. and Mrs. Campbel were together. I saw him on one occasion alone. It was downstairs. My daughter wished to see him, and we went to the hotel together. I saw him several times in and about the hotel. I went there upon business. My business is my owis. What took me there? Why, I walked there. I don't live there. I live in Richmond-street, Lisson-grove. I can't tell you what took me to the Haymarket, but I can say that I saw Mr. Campbell. I never took any liquor to Mrs. Campbell. I saw Mr. Garston there once or twice. My daughter was talking to Mr. Garston when Mr. Campbell came up and gave her in charge. Cross-examined.-I had a letter from my daughter which I refused to give to Mr. CampbeUl until I got the wages. I have sent out an authority to my daughter to sue Mr. Campboll for the wages. He was bound to send my daughter out to Australia with a family, but he had not done so, and t'-erefore she had been put to an expense by having to pay her owi pasae MmrY-2s.o .-I a nurse. I know Mrs. Campbell. I attended Mrs. Campbell in the month of August for one week. I went with her from the Colonnade Hotel to Hampatead. I'was engaged by Mr. Campbell. I took a letter to Mrs. Campbell from Dr. Smith. I did not give the letter to Mrs. Campbell, but to Mr. CampbelL I don't know Mr. William Russel, but a nephew of Mrs. CampbeU came. He was a taU yoiung mnan. Dr. Smith told me that I was to attend upon Mrs.Campbell.Idon't knowwhat she was suffering from. I don't know that she bad had a miscarriage. Mr. Camp, bel gave me directions. We got to Hampstead about 5 in the evening. We went to a little house upon a green. There was somethnes something singular about e rs. (ampbell. She used to crack nuts, and was agitated. Mr. Camp. bell said he was afraid her head was affected, that she had had a miscarriage, and was rather nervous. Mrs. Camgbel's little girl was there; she was three years old. Mrs. Camp. bell was very fond of her. On the Sunday a governess called, but she did not come into the house. Two boys and three girls came with her. They were Mrs. Campbel's children. They went up to Hamipstead-heath. She be. baved very affectionately to her children. The children came again during the week. They came after dinner. The last time their papa came also. I did not see Mr. CampbeU with Mrs. Cam pbell. Mrs. Campbell did not indulge in strong liquors. She was very sober. She only took half.a pint of beer a-day. She had wine in the house but sbe did not take it. Mr. Cam pbell sent a bottle of port wine, but she did not open it. She received no other visitors. She lived very quietly. On the following Satur- dyM.Cama p el came very early in the motining andI sawv Mayrs m bel. Mrs. Campbell hada parlour andtwobed m.rig He accse a apbUofnss 1t rosomeoes, Mr. Campbell came at balf.pasthain the morning on that Satuday. He told me to go to the postoffice and order the addresses of the letters Mrs. Campbell might write to be taken, The eldest young lady is 13 years old. Mr. Ca nphe saw Mrs. Campbel that morning. He acc-sesd Mrs Campbell of passing letter-s to some one. Mr. Campbell said that shehad been seena to do so. I was out with her on the occasion he named, but she sent me in 'with a little dog, and I did not see anything. I was not awvay more than five minutes. Mr. Campbell told me to listen to what he said to trs. Campbell. That was all that passed. There was no violence. He came again after dinner, and brought the children to bid their mamma good bye. They went up into the bedroom. The children aU cried on seeing their mamma. Mr. Campbell took the little child away. The little thing clung round her mamma's neck, and Mr. CampbeU held her by the shoulders, and at last he parted them. I did not assist in parting them. Mr. Campbell and I went to the 9ly withtls children. I saw them off. Mr. Campbell did not come again. He did not go up into the bedroom after he had taken the children away. Cross-exnmined.-I had been recommended by Dr. Smith befere this. I have had the care of insane persons. The letter from Dr. Smith was directed to Mr. CampbelL Dr. Smith ordered her to have her little child. As we were going along in the cab Mrs. Campbell got out of the cab in Regent-street and wrote a letter to Captain Garston, She posted it herself. When we were at Hampstead Mrs. Campbell wrote several letters. On the Saturday after Mr. Cmpbl had been she wrote to Captain Garston. It was ter he accused her of passing letters that he took away the c'nild. On the Sunday Mrs. Campbell went away alone. Mr. Ca pbthel whas onl yha lf a nU h ouIr sn the house w hen he too awy te cild Mr Capbel tldme to be very kind to mrs Campbeul ana to 'watch her. He wad she was a~ little queer in her mlind. Mary Ann Agar and er aother both came to Hampstesa dazlingthe week. Mr. MA&cQUEM said that he had now clearly p roved con. donace on the part of the petitioner, and also that he had Mravated the csae bya sublequent abandonment.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY, THURSDAY, M.AY 28. CORLEY V. LORD STAFFORD. CAMPBELL V. CORLEY. (Before tw LrORDS JUSTICES of APPEL.) These suits, which have been before this Court very many times, and reported in 2Se Times, were placed in the paper for judgment. The courts of the country, civil, criminal, and ecclesiastical, have in turns been the places in which the chief litigants, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Corley, have tried their strength and exhibited their acrimony. Now, however, the difference is limited to the Iwrangle which may take place on Saturday week, on the settlement of the minutes of the decree, the effect of which decree is that the 12,5004 stock, in which Mr. Corley takes a life interest, is reduced by the full amount of al the costa in " Corley v. Lord Stafford," and that Mr. Campbell will take the whole of his mother's personal estate, and Mr. Corley wil pay all the costs of the suit of "Campbell v. Corley," excepting 101. Lord Justice K-NIGHT BRUCE said, that Miss Constantia Gostling, an English lady of the Roman Catholic persuasion, born in 1770, married in 1812 M1r. Campbell, who died in 1819, leaving by her a son, Aklexander Francis Campbell, who was born in 1813. He was the only child which she ever had. She remained a widow tiU 1850, when, being of the age of 80 or 81, she was married to MIr. Corley, a Protestant member of the Irish bar, and afterwards admitted to the Englisb bar at the Middle Temple. For the purpose of the marriage he represented his age to be 50, and hers to be 65. That she hadmisrepresented her age to him he did not believe. She was certainly old enough to be his mother, though he did not think he was quite young enough to be her grandson. It was impossible, therefore, to say what object she could have had in consenting to this marriage. She had sufficient income; she was of good connexions and station in life; she also appeared to be of good education, her letters being on the whole well expressed, and the errors in orthography venial. Her conduct during widowhood had been irreproachable, and it was probable that no greater intimacy existed between the parties after marriage than before. Perhaps the conduct of her son, and the gross manner in which he had sometimes forgotten himself towards her, induced her to enter into this marriage. Not that her affection for him had been entirely extinguished. Notwithstanding Ilis conduct to her,she appeared to have still loved him. She died in 1851, leaving her Son her sole next of kin. This state of circumstances gave occasion to two suits, to both of whiclh Mr. Corley and Mr. Campbell were parties, and to one of wlhich Lord Stafford was also a party as trustee of the sum of 12,5001. stock, subjectto the trusts of the wiU of Mrs. Camnpbell's father. With respect to the frst cause, the establishment of the marriage in the Ecclesiastical Court reduced the question to one of costs only for it was plain and was indeed admitted at the bar, that ir. Campbell ha shown no title to deprive Mr. Corley of his life interest in this sum of stock as the husband of Mrs. Campbell, for so she should be called,as she used the name after her marria^e. Mr. Corley must therefore be declared entitled to tie whole of the dividends as from the death of his wife. As to the costs of that suit, his Lordship must observe that he was not satisfied that Mr. Campbell had prosecuted his cause without superfluous pertinacity, or with discretion or moderation. Much of his conduct in this matter would have been better otherwise. Eis Lordship thought, however, that such a marriage, and one effectedin such a manner, was an achievement naturally not believed unless upon irresistible evidence, nor was Mr. Campbell's claim against Mr. Corley much to be wondered at. It seemed to him that both parties had so acted that Mr. Campbell ought not to pay or receive costs in that suit. The other parties would have their costs out of the capital. Then, with regard to the suit of " Campbell v. Corley," so far as it sought to affect the life interest of Mr. Corley the same observations applied, except as to costs. But the suit related to the personal estate of Mrs. Cam pbell. The property, amounting to between 6,0001. and 9,0001., was sought to be retained by Mr. Corley as the husband and administrator of his wife ; and, on the other hand, was claimed by Mr. CampbeU as that lady's next of kin. As to this claim, he was of opinion that a case within the allegations of the bil had been established by the plaintiff. The credible evidence, oral and written, direct and indirect, taken together, appeared to his Lordship to prove the foHowing facts .- Fhat Mrs. Campbel before her marriage, but after she had formed the design of marriage, and after the defendant had been informed of that design, intended not to marry without a settlement; that the defendant knew this-that a settlement was required by Mrs. Campbell to prevent the nsarriage from having effect on her property, and to leave it after the marriage as free from any consequences of the marriage as if none had taken place; that the defendant was aware of this intention, and expressed his assent to it, and was believed by Mrs. Campbell to have assented to it; that he was trusted by her to prepare and make a settlement according to her wishes; that before the marriage he undertook to do so, and that he was believed to have performed his undertaking; and that, relying on this undertaking, and on the defendant's skill, good faith, and honesty, Mrs. Campbell married him. These facts, he repeated, were substantially proved by the evidence, and the prayer of the bill was properly framed for obtaining relief. That relief, must, of course, be to place Mr. Campbell, as the sole next of kin of his mother, in the same position as if her intention had been properly executed before marriage. Neither by the law of England nor of any other jurisprudence was an agent alowed to derive benefit from his own breach of faitb, mistake, or neghgence. But some of these facts were denied by Mr. Corley, who relied on his own evidence-admissible, indeed, but not necessarily to be trusted or followed, especially when at variance with the produced correspondence between himself and Mrs. CampbelL In this case he acknowledged that he did not think Mr. Corley's evidence was trustworthy. But the defendant contended that in 1849 the contract for marriage was broken off, and that after that time there was no agreement as to the settlement of the property. except what ap eared upon the documents of the Oth of June, 1850. His Lordship was, however, of opinion | that Mrs. Campbell's original intentions continued, and were known to the defendant to continue, down to the time of her marriage, and that he was bound to give effect to them. At first he was surprised at tho possession by Mrs. Campbell of the paper in which the sum of 2,0001. was distinctly mentioned; but, considering the circumstances, the age of the lady, and the age and profession of the defendant, he was of opinion that the possession of that paper was not saffcient to counteract the effect of the rest of the evidence. The decree, therefore, in the second suit must be against the defendant, with costs, to the extent of the rehef prayed respecting the settlement. The sum of 101. would be allowed for his costs so far as they were increased by the plaintift'e claim to the life interest in the stock - but, subject to this, the defendant must pay all the costs of the suit. Lord Justice TURNER said that the only material question for decision i the first suit was as to costs. Mr. Corley had established his title to the personal estate of his deceased wife as her administrator, and then the question was whether there was any agreement as to its settlement, which in truth there was. Mr. Corley had alleged that there was an agreement by Mrs. Campbell that she should have power to give it, lmited, however, to 2,0001., which was in the fol. Lowing words, and dated June 20, 1850:- Memorial of an Agreement entered into this 2Ã¯Â¿Â½th Day of June. 1550. "Whereas I Jolun Corley, hereby agree to becom,e a consenting party to such deed or document, to be duly signed, sealed, andattesteA ynredible witnesses, as may be mnutuaDy agreed on, by which Mrs. Const antia Canmpbell wil be folly authorized and empowered. notwithstanding her coverture, to make such disposition as may be agreod and directedthereit of such dividends or fundr, amounting to the sum of Ã¯Â¿Â½2,000, out of whatever funds or dividenda she shall be entitled to, be pessesedof,orhave legallyaused at thetime of her decease.

"Joins COB,sy JAMES irTENnFolWDEx Witness" The question was whether that agreement was true, or whether. on the contrary, there was an agreement to settle the whole property of the lady, and whether the trusts declared by Mr. Corley in that instrument were such as she intended. The question of what was intended to be comprised in the settlement, whether all or only 2,0001., depended on the correspondence, on the memorandum of agreement, and on MIr. Corley's own testimony. The correspondence proved that Mrs. Campbell agreed that he should enjoy the life interest under her father's wvil, and that she should have power over the whole of her property in the same-way as if she were unmarried. The correspondence satisfied theomind of his lordship that she insisted upon this, and that he agreed toit without limit or exception. Of the memorandum of agreement Mr. Corley gave three different accounts, each upon oath, the result of which was that no reliance could be placed upon his evidence, and his Lordship did not hesitate to say that he did not believe one word of his depositions or affidavits,- and, as Mtr. Corley's own evidence was the only proof of the genuineness of the agreement, it was neediegs to say that there was no evidence at all upon which any court of justice could rely, or ought to ct esecall wengivn n hs wnbehalf.

ROILS' COURT, CwBoy-LA. BLMy 28. _-- UAVENDISH V. GEAV.-J1ma%.N,'p- (Before tiw MASTFrs of ake ROLES.) kils UOXOUR gave judgment in this case, the facts of which have been already reported, and are briefly as fol. lows :-The plaintiff, General Cavendish, borrowed of his bankers, Messrs. Snow, Paul, and Co., in 1830, two sams of 3,0001. and 5,0001. respectively, for which he gave two bonds as security. In 1843 he borrowed a further sum of 1,5001. of the same bank, for which he gave his promissory note. In 1848 the plaintiff repaid the bank 1,0001. off his promissory note, and in 1852 paid the remaining 5001. Between these two last years and in the year 1851 the bank lent General Cavendish a further sum of 1,0001, for which they took no security whatever. In 1855 the bank, then trading under the name of Sir John Dean Paul and Co., stopped payment, having previously assigned, without notice to General Cavendish, his two bonds and promissory-note to the trustees of a Mrs. Gore's and a Mrs. Fitzgerald's marriage settlement, and having in their possession, at the time of their failure, a surn of I,5001. standing to the account of General Cavendish, as one of their ordinary depositors. 'Under these circumstances the question raised was whether General Cavendish was not entitled to a set-off, as far his deposit of 1,5001. was concerned, and the present sait was filed to estabhsh sueh set-off against athe trustees of the marriage settlements of Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Eitzgerald, as assignees of the bonds and promissory note deposited as security with them. The Court held that the sums of 1,0001. and 5001. paid by General Cavendish to the bank, in 1848 and 1852 respectively, must be taken to have been paid in satisfaction of the bond of 1,500o., which must therefore be held as cancelled against General Cavendish; and that of the plaintifFs 1,5004, in the hands of the bank at the time of its failure, 1,0001. must be allowed as a set-off against, the 1,0001. lent by the bank to the plaintiff in 1851, the remain- ng5001. being allowed pr-o r-aidparte, as a set-off against the two bonds of 3,0004 and 5,0001., respectively. o n this proportion, therefore, the trastees of Mrs. Gore and Mrs Fitzgerald would hold these bondsas responsible to General Cavendish's set-off, and the General would bh allowed the costs of the present suit.
VICE-CHAITCB=oM COTTRT9 Mv 9 CROW V. TAYLOR. WJe!ore ViceChancdor Sir R. T. K1mjjESLi;y.1 .IUE R XrbuHR moved in this case for an ex parte injunc. tion to restrain the transfer of a sum of 2,0001. stock stand. ing in the names of tho defendant and two other parties, now dead, in the Bank of England. It appeared that the stock in question was left by a testator named Wilkinson in 1827 to Elzabeth Crow (then an infant) for life, and there was a direction to invest in the names of the defendant and two persons named Rough and Glenny; this was ultimately done, and Rough and Glenny were both dead. A distringas had been placed upon the tund, and the pitintiff had re. ceived notice from the Bank that the defendant intended to transfer it. The eight days had nearly expired before the ?laintbff could communicate with the advisers of the defendant, party caused by the intervention of the late recess, and hence, unless the defendant were restrained, the transfer would take place. Trhe VIcE.CASCELLoR made the order upon the usual undertaking. SALT V. BURY. This was a motion to vary the chief clerk's certificate, fnding that certain warehouses and premises, called " Paul's Garner," on the river Lea, at Ware, were of copyhold tenure of the manor of Sandon, in the county of Hlertford. It appeared by extracts from Domesday Book and other early documents, which had been inspected in the muniment rooms of the dean and chapter of St. Paul's, that the manor of Sandon (which is 18 miles from Ware) was granted to the dean and chapter in the reign of King Athlestane, A.D. 930, and that in 1261 the property at W'are was granted to tbe dean and chapter in fee, and they granted it to others, and in 1302 there was a grant to one Master Walter, son of William the Fisherman, subject to a quit rent of 6s. 8d. There was some question as to the identity of the land contained in these grants. The court rolls of London showed that the property had been dealt with as copyhold of the manor of Sandon from the year 1653. The question on the present motion arose between the widow of one of two brothers, who were tenants in tail of the property, and the creditors of the other brother, who were plaintiffs in the suit. The decree directed an inquiry whether the property was freehold or copyhold, and whether the widow was entitled to dower or free bench out of it. The dean and chapter, as the superior lords of the manor, and their lessee, were no parties to the suit. It appeared that the premises in question had, in fact, been used as a garner or granary for storng the corn rents of the dean and chapter at LWare, whence they were transported to ondon by Mr. Glasse, Mr. Bevir, Mr. Haddan, and Mr. Barslake appeared for the several parties. 'the VIOE.CsANOELLOR thought that the evidence as to the tenure was too doubtful to justify the positive finding of the chief clerk; so, without expressing any opinion as to thellegal question, the matter must be referred back to the chief clerk to review his certificate so as to enable the matter to be tried in a more satisfactory manner, and, if necessary, with the assistance of further evidence. (Before Yice-Chanedlor Sir J. STUART.) SCOTT V. THE CORPORITIOl OF LaVERPOOL. This was a motion on behalf of the defendants, that they might be at liberty, notwithstanding the time for closing the evidence in the cause had expired, to file affidavits in reply to certain affidavits filed by the plaintiff. The biU -was filed for the pu se of obtaining an account of works done by the plaintiff for the defendants in relation to the new waterworks at Liverpool. The time for closing the evidence expired on the 17th of April, and the defendants' case in support of the motion was that on the 16th of April, the day before the evidence closed, the plaintiff filed an affidavit impeaching the character and credit of two im. portant witnesses for the defence. It was now sought, on the defendants' behalf, that they might have an opportunity of answering those affidavits. It was contended on the part of the plaintiff that the ground alleged in support of the motion was not of such a nature as to justify the Court in making the order - that the success of the application would .ause delay, and that it would be competent for the Court on the hearing of the cause, if it then see fit to do so, to give the defendants the opportunity of answering the affidavits which they now sought to reply to. Mr. Bacon and Mr. Hawkins were for the defendants; and Mr. alins and Mr. Karslake for the plaintiff. The VYixCHA=ELaoR, after adverting to the distinction between such an application as the present and one for enlarging the time for closing the evidence, sdd that the case now before the Court was obviously one in which the defendants should have an opportunity of explaining the circumstances in respect to which the credit of the two witnesses in question had been im. peached. The question was whether the defendants should ave that opportunity given to them now or at the hearing, and he thought it should be gsven to them now. He should give the defendants leave within ten days after service of the order on the present motion to file such affidavits as they mightb advised in answer to those parts of the plaintitis affidaiats upon which the present application was founded. (Before Vice-ChancellorSir W. P. WOOD.) ICicLETHwAIT V. MICOXLETIVArY This was a motion on behalf of the defendant to dissolve an injunction which had been obtained restraining him from cutting down any timbner in the avenue and park of the Beeston estate, in Norfolk, of which he was tenant for life without impeachment of waste, under the will of his father, Nathaniel Micklethwait. Nathaniel Mcklethwait was the owner in fee of two estates in Norfolk, one of which, called Beeston, was witnin four miles of Norwich; the other was known as Taverham-halL In 1823 Mr. Micklethwait removed from Beeston to Taverham-hall, and in 1845 pulled down the mnansion at Beeston, but left the shrubbery, gardens, and avenue still standing. By his wil, made in 1852, Mr. Micklethwait devised the Beeston and Taverham-hall estates to tshe defendant, John Nathaniel MKicklethwalt, for hiblfe, without impeachment of waste, other than and except voluntary waste, in pulling down houses or build. ings, and not rebuilding the same or others of equl op greater jalue. The will contained apower Ot leadng any past of the real estate, except the mansion-house called Taverhambhall, 'With the buildings, plantations, gardens, and pleasure gromnds ususiiy occupied therewith, and also a power of sale and es change of tho real estates. The testator died in January, 1856. The defendant, who thereupon became tenant for life in possession, proposed to cut down 153 old oak trees, many of which were standing in the avenue and park at Beeston, and had entered intoa contract with a timEer merehant for the sale to him of the timber. The plaintiff. who was the first tenant in remainder, had thereupon filed his bill to restrain the feling these trees, on the ground that they were ornamental timber, and as such entitled to be protected by a court o equity from being felled by a tenant 20orlife without impechment of waste. An ex artc injunction had been obtained, which the defendant now moved to dissolve. Mr. ROLT and Mr. GrARD, in support of the motion, contended that no case Was to be found where timber had been held " ornamental " where it was not connected with the etnhjoyment of a residence. Whatever might have been th original character of these trees, the testator by punDiag down the mansion had himself altered the nature of thP property, and deprived the trees of their " ornamental" character. MIr. CsIM and Mr. LEwn,, for the plaintiff, contended that the protection given by a court of equity was not coufined to =eesleft standing as ornamental to a residence. Although the testator had pulled down the mansion, yet the mere fact of his leaving the avenue and other trees standing was evidence of their being intended to retain the character of ornamental timber. Those who succeeded the present tenant for life might choose to rebuild the mansion at Beeston, or it might, from its situation near ITorwich, be eligible for a residence if sold; nor ought the defendant to be allowed thus to deteriorate the character of the property and reduce it to the condition of ordinary arable ground. Mr. GiBABD replied. The VI-CHNCELLoR observed that the question was one of some nicety. EI would give judgment to-morrow (this) morning.
COU1RT OF QTIMBN'S BENC WzsTMNmsTER, MAy 28. BOVILL V. IEYWOUTT AND ANOTIM}. (S#tiigs rn Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and JudtiS COLERIIDG, ERLB, and CORO3PTON.) Lord CAmPBELL now delivered the judgment of the Court in this case as folows --We are of opinion that the objections to the validity of this patent cannot be supported. The whole of the plaintiff's proces3, if the combination be new, is certainly the subject of a patent; and so Zwould the part No. 2, if taken separately, for " exhausting the air from the cases of millstones, combined with the application of la blast to the grinding surface3," as they introduce very important improvements in manufacturing wheat and other grain into four. The combination of the " exhaust" with the "blast," so as to carry off the warm dusty air blown through between the stones to a chamber above, while the pure flour in a dry condition, without the "stive," descends into a chamber below, added to the quantity and improved the quality of the flour produced in grinding, and its effec' was highly favourable to the health and comfort of the men employed in the operation. Still, if the specification does not point oit the mode by which this part of the process (No. 2) is to be conducted, so as to accomiphsh the object in view, it would be the statement of a principle only, and the patent would have been invalid. But we are of opinion that the specification on the face of it cannot, as contended, be pronounced in point of law to be bad in this respect and we are of opinion that the evidence adduced at the trial shows it to be quite suflicient. The specification says:- *In carying out the seoend part of my invention. when worldng milstones with a blast of air, introduoo a pipe to the mnllstone care from a fan or other exhausting machine, so as to carry off all thewarm dusy airblown through between the stones to a chamber as hereafter describecd, and this partof my Invention relates only to the sucking awvay tbe'4pienum' of dusty alr forced through the atones, and not to emlploying a sufficient exhausting power to induce a current of air betwreen the milstones without a blast." The exhaust produced by the pipe and fan is to be propor. tioned to the " plenum" caused by the blast, taking care not to produce the inconvenient current of air against which a caution is given. How cau a judge take upon himself to say that this may not be enough to enable a workman of competent slm to construct the machinery? According to the evidence, the specification was abundantly sufficient for this purpose, and therefore it could be no more necessary in the specification to explain the details by which the pipe and fau were to bo employed to create and to regulate the " exhaust" than to describe how the milstone case or the stones themselves were to be fashioned. The learned counsel for the defendants, after being familiarly acq.uainted with the manner in which this part of the process is conducted, being asked to suggest the fit language to be employed to instruct the workmen how to adjust the "exhaust," so as properly to suck away the "plenum" that the "stive" may be discharged into the chamber above, were unable to devise any improvement upon the specification. Therefore the pintiff, being- now allowed to be the inventor, the jury being, in our opinion, fully justified in finding that the process had not been publicly practised at Glasgow before the date of the patent, and the specification being sufficient, the patent is valid; andwo have only to consider whether there has been an actionable infringement of it by the defendants using the exhaust and the blast in the manner described, No. 2, in a mil in which the upper stone rotated and the nether stone was fixed. The plaintiff contends that his patent, as explained by the specification, was originaUy for four separate and independent inventions, and that No. 2 in the amended speeification must be considered a separate and independent invention, as if the patent had been granted for this alone. The defendants contend, on the contrary, that the patent was granted for one process, comprising several successive and connected parts, the use of fixed upper millstones being one of them. We do not think it necessary to try to reconcile the different arts of the specification (which are somewhat conflictng;, or to give any positive opinion upon this question; for, supposing the patent to be for a combination, consisting of several parts for one procees, we are of opinion that the defendants are liable in this action for having used a material part of the process which was new, for the same purpose as that mentioned in the specification, although they did not at the same time use all the parts of the process as specified. The defendants admit that they used the part of the process No. 2 as described in the amended specication, and they rest their defence upon the fact that they did so only in a mil with a rotating upper millstone; but, if the fixed upper millstone were clearly described by the plaintiff in the statement and diagram to be found in his specification as part of the combination for which he took ont -his patent, -as No. 2 is a material part of the combination, and was new, we are of opinion that he cannot lawfully use No. 2 for the same purpose, by substituting a rotating upper millstone for a fixed upper millstone, or by resorting to any other equivalent for any other separate part of the process specified. This case seems to us to be governed by " Lister v. Leather," and the authorities which in that case we fully commented upon, and therefore that there ought to be judgment for the plaintiff. DE LA RIUE AND OTHERS V. DICKENSON AID OTHERS. Lord CArPBELL now delivered the judgment of the Court in this case as follows:-We are of opinion that the rule obtained by the defendants in this case ought to be discharged. It is admitted that the inventions for which the two patents sued upon were granted were new and useful; and the only objection to the specifications is that the claims in them are too wide and vague. The usual dilemma, bowever, is propounded, that upon this objection the patents are void; or that, if the claims are construed to be within legal limits, there has been no infringerent of them by the defendants. After carefully considering the specifications, we think that the claim ineach isfor described means of conductinga useful process, resulting in a valuable manufacture; and that the specifications distinctly show what portions of those means are claimed as new, and what portions are allowed to be old. We therefore have only to determine whether the alleged infringement of them has been established. The de. fendants contend that there was no evidence of infringe ment to be left to the jury, and that the judge, at the clse of the plaintiffs case, was bound either to have directed a nonsuit, or to have ordered a verdict to be eutered for the defendants upon the plea of " Not Guilty." We are told that evidence being given of what the defendants actually did in the process alleged to be the infringement, it is always theprovince of the judge to say whether there has been an infringement or not; and that, in the present case the judge, without calling upon the defendants for an answer, ought to have determined by his own authority that there had been no infringement. We consider, however, that the doctrine contended for is contrary to principle, would render it Impossible to administer the law of patents, and is by no means to be deduced from "IUnwin v. Heath," or any of the other decisions referred to. There may well be a case where the judge may and ought to take upon himself to say that the plaintiff has offered no evidence to be left to the jury to prove infringement-as, if there were a patent for a chymical composition, and the evidence were that the defendant has constructed and used a machine for combing wool; but if the evidence hasa tendency to show that the defendant hed used substautially the same means to obtain the same resultasspeoified bytheplaintiff-andscientificwitnesseshave sworm that the defendant actually has used such means-tbe questionbecomesone of fact, or of factmixedwith law, which the judge is bound to submit to the jury. There can be no doubt that such evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs, both with respect to the patent of 1845 and the patent of 1849. The defendants, therefore, are confined to the contention that the verdict was against the evidence. With respect to the patent of 1845, they ae clearly so far right when they insist that nothing which they did intheir mode of conducting the process of rmakirg envelopes, prior to the stage of the process where they had got the flaps of the blank in afit state forthe second descent of the plunger to fold them, could be construed to be an infrngement; for the plaintiffs had disclaimed the "cresing" accomplshed by Adenbrook's machine, and admitted that the defendant' " rir jets" must be considered a discovery, which would be the subject of a patent. But at this sage the plaintiffs' claim begins; and there was evidence of resemblance between the manner in which the plaintiffs and defendants completed the process, and produced the perfect envelopes, from which we are of opinion that the jury were justified in oomingto the conclusmon that the defendants' process was an imiltation of and was substantially the same as the plaintif. The folding of the flaps now commences, and the plaintifrs fold the fiaps in succession by the folding instruments most ingemously actuated by "cams." The defendants likewise use folding instruments inserted in the inverted box of the plungers, and the stroke of the descending plunger, making them folding instruments, called " projections," touch the different fape in succession, folds them finally in the same manner, although not in the same order. Whether the two modes of folding bz the " cams" nad by the "plunger" be essentially different, or substautially the same, we think, wsa pure question of fact for the jury; and we cannot say that the Jury were wrong in the conclusion to which they arrived. Great stress was laid by the defendants upon the fact that, according to this process, there vau ao contrivance for hold. ing the blank while the folding wras goingon ; but we think that the judge was right in telling the jury that there might be an infringement without a contrivance to hold the fiap if withont such a contrivance the twro modes of folding were aubstantiaUy the same. The foldg being a materiaiPart of the plaintiffs' process of manufacturin envelopes, it is not necessary to determine whether their claim extended to the zest of the process, and whether the two modes of delivery of the perfect envelopes be essentially different or be substantially the same; but we would observe that, gene. rally speaking, as the manufacture which is the result of the process invented and patented is the ultimate objectinview, the purpose of the patent laws is to protect aU that is new in this procees, if it bo described, although not expressly claime. With respect to the patent of 1849, for * gumming" the envelopes, the jury at the trial, after attentively examining the two models and seeing them work, expressed a clear opinion that the defendants? was a colourable imitation of the plaintiffi', and we think that this oonclusion was fully warranted by the evidenoe. The great argument of the defendants was that they did not take the gum from " an intermediary surface," and that their process of gumming could not properly be called "=surfac printing," but wo are of opinion that they might be guilty or an infringement without using an intermediary surface, and that, without what is strictly called " surface printing," they mighb " apply gum to the flaps of the envelopes by operatiosacting in tthhe manner of gsface direct from a fountain containing the gum." For tese reasons we think that the verdict ought not to be dis. turbe i, and wre pronounce judgment for the plaintiffs THE QUEN V. LOWM In this case the Court had granted a rnle calling upon John Lowe, the printer and publisher of tho OheUtenham (ThronicZe and Pa,-s Register, to show cause why a criminal information should not be fi7ed against him for a libel pub. hished in that journalon the l4th of Aprillat reflecting on the character and conduct of Mr. W. Boodle, a tolicitor at ohetenham. r.Senjeant PIGOTT (with whom was Mxr. Powell) now tated that h under the defendant was desirous of retractingthe chsrges which he had made against Mr. Boodle in the a ticefomnDlained of, and paying the costs of ths prent rule, if the; Court would sanction itg dischage on thoseterms. Mr. BoodlehadcomebeforotheCourtmerely to vindioate his character and toset himself Tight with the public; and, having no vindictivo fooling, he was quite ready to leave the case in the hands of the court. Mr. SKM-EB said he appeared for the defendant, who wished merely to say that his attention had not been called to the article before the application was made to this Court. Lordcl CIANZ.-But he could not have been igorant of the article. Mr. SBEMER said he mentioned the circumstance only as introductorv to the observation that as soon as the defendant's a:tention was caled to the article he inserted an apology in his newspaper. He was anxious now to express his regret for what h ehad done, but he had already suffered some Punishment in the censure pased upon him by the Court when the rule was granted, which he felt to be a hevy blow to him. HO was, howveer, ready to pay any expens to which Mir. Boodle had been pnt by the application, andto retract and apologize for the allegations made; and he trusted the Court would consent to the rule being discharged on the defendant's paying the costs. Lord CAMPBELL said he did not think tho Court would refuse to sanction that the rule should be discharged on the termns proposed. At the same time, his Lordship observed, MIr. Boodle was fully justified in maidng the application to this Court. Some license was allowed at a time of excite. ment, but to make attacks on private character and calumnious charges for which there was no foundation could not be tolerated. But. as Mr. Lowe had made an ample apology, and Mr. Boodle was fully satisfied, the rule might be discharged on the terms Droposed. Rule discharged, on the payment of costs by the defendant. THE QUEEN V. BROWN AIND OTHERS, JUSTIOES OF MON- MOUTH. In this case the Court had granted a rule calling upon Mr. Thomas Brown and four other magistrates of the county of Monmouth to show cause why a mandamus should nbt issue comxanding them to hear and determine an informatioalaid before t em against Mr. Crawshay Bailey, by Mr. Herbert Mackworth, one of Her Majesty's ispectors of coal mines. The information was laid against Mr. Crawshay Bailey as one of the owners of the Deep Pit Mine, for an offence against the seventh rule contained in the fourth section of the Act to Amend the Law for the Inspection of Coal Mines in Great Britain (18th and 19th of Victor ca. 108), which requires that "e very steam beiler shad be providedwithaproper steam gauge, water gauge, and safety valve." By the 11th section of the Act it was enacted "that if any such general rules, or special rules, which ought to be observed by the owner and principal agent or VIewer of such mine or coliery, beneglectedor wilfully violated by any such owner, agent, or viewer, such person shall be liable to a penalty of not exceeding 51.," &c. When the parties appeared before the magistrates it was objected, on the part of Mr. Bailey, that, though he was one of the owners of the mine, and resident, and took an active fart in its management, he was not the sole owner, but onl y one of several owners, all of whom ought to have been summoned. The magistrates-all of whom were muanagers of mines, with the exception of one, who was a clergyman-recognized the objection, and dismissed the information. An application was then made to this Courtfor a mandamus, upon the ground that the magistrates had declined to exercise their jurisdiction. Mr. GRAY now showed cause against the rule, and com. plained that the prosecutor should have stated to the Court that four of the defondants were managers of mines, as such a statement was calculated to prejudice them. If it was intended to suggest that the magistrates had acted cor. ruptly the prosecutor should have proceeded against them in another manner. But, in fact, the magistrates had acted in the belief that the objection was a good one. Lord CAMPBELL.-It is in the nature of a ploa of abatement, on the groand that ad the proper parties were not joined. hMr. Justice COLERIDGE asked whether an owner in France was liable for the neglgence of the resident owner. Mr. Justice CROMPTOm said that by the Act the rule must be "neglected or wilfnUy violated."e Lord CAM.PBELL askod whether it was proosed to be set up that the other owners had wilfUy violate the Act. Mr. GRAY said it was not, MX. Justice COLERIDGE said, suppose all the owners had been brought before the magistrates, and it was proved that it was done by the default of one; could not the magistrates convict the one ? Mr. Justice CROMPTON said he was not sure that they might not. Lord C&MPBELL said that if they were aU in fault they might all be separately fined. Mr. GRAY stated the view which the magistrates had taken of the matter, but he said he could not showthatthey were right. He submitted the magistrates had adjudicated. Lord CAIPBSnLL said the magistrates had declined juris. diction. Mr. Justice ERLE sUggested that the objection was ground of defence. His Lordship added that where magis. trates wrongly decided the cardinal fact on which their jurisdiction depended, this Court would grant a mandamus. Lord CrNIPBELL said he was clearly of opinion that the rule ought to be made absolute. The magistrates said they had ated conscientiously, andhe(Lord Campbell) felt bound to believe them. Still they had come to a strange conclusion.Therewasnopretence for saying thsat proceedings could not be taken against one owner for his personal neglect and wrongful conduct. The notion that it was necessary that a charge should be brought against aU the owners was unfounded, and almost absurd. The only question was whether what the magistrates had said was a reason why this Court should grant a mandamus and caU upon them to adjudicate. In the present case he (Lord Campbell) was of opinion that the magistrates had declined to adjudicate. They said they could not proceed, becauso an objection in the nature of a plea of abatement in civil causes was made, that the right parties were not brought before the Court. That as a declining jurisdiction, and not exercising it. le (Lord Campbell) could not here refrain from saying, in reference to the catastrophes which had taken place from the neglect of this Act of Parliament, that magistrates ought to regard it as their most sacred duty to enforce the law, whether they happened to be owners of mines or had no connexion with any. Mr. Justice COLEDGE said he was of opinion that the magstrates had declined jurisdiction. It was sometimes diffcult to know where to draw the line, but his Lordship thought that if at any time during the examination the magistrates said they could not properly form a judgment on the subject that amounted to a declining of the JUriS- diction. ju Mr. Justice ERi. concurred in the judgment, and added that it would be most important, at some time, with the aid of able advocates, to come to some prindple for ascer. taining whether magistrates decided on the facts on which their jurisdiction dependedor on the facts of the complaint. sis Lordship thought that that could not depend on the time wnen,the objection was taken; but he ropeated an observation which ne made in a previous case, "IThe Queen v. Dayman," that where the mAgistrtes committed a mis. take as to the fact on whih their jurisdiction depended thsCutoght to intrfre Mr.JusiceCR~1P0N onurrd i to judgment, and his Lordship added that he had no doubt as to the soundnes ofth deison f hisCort n Thie Queenv.

(SiUings at Aisi Prius, at Westminster, beoore Mfr. Justice CROWDnM and Common Juries.) :lG V. SIBERBERG. This cause was tried at the sittings after Easter Term, and a report of the facts was then given in Te 7iemes. The ju, being unable to ag"ee upon a verdict, were discharged, and it now came on for hearing a second time. The trial commenced yesterday and was resumed and concluded to-day. Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and3 Mr. Hawkins were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Overend, QC., and MIr. F. H. Lewis for the defendant. This was, as our readers may remember, an action for slander and for the wrongful dismissal of the plaintiff from the defendants service as traveller; and the defendant pleaded a justification of both acts. Mr. Silberberg is a tobacconist in Fleet-street, and it appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff that he (King) was looking out for a situation, and went to the defendant in Januarylast in consequence of seeing an advertisement. An agreement for a year was then entered into between them, under which it was stipulated that theplaintiff should go into the defend. ant's service as traveller at 34 per week, exclusive of certain commission. It was part of his duty to take out samples, and he travelled and took orders tiU the 6th of February last, when the circumstances occurred out of which this action arose. It seemed that it was his practice to sort and take the samples himself, which ae conceived he was entitled to do, as he had allowed travellers in his own employ to do the same, and he said it was a common thing. "i t is necessary," he observed, "for the traveller to smoke some cigars himself, in order that the customer may smell the flavour." On the 6th of February he went into Mr. Silberberg's shop; the shopman was packing some cigars at a side connter. and the defendant was there. He said to the shopman, "I shall take some of these as a sample" within the hearing of the defendant, and he took three of the cigas. Afterwards the defendant, who before the plaintiff took the three cigars had left the shop, called to the plaintiff and said he had taken some cigars and had been robbing him. The plaintifr in answer, said, " Yes, I bave taken three for a sample to represent your interest." The defendant then said, " You are a d- thief; you shall not go out for me again." The plaintiff then said, " Good God, Sir, you cannot believe that I am a thief to rob you of apaltry three cigars:" The defendant then said, " You have robbed me before." To this the plaintiff replied, " If there is any irregularity, I wish you to tell me as a gentleman what I am to do, and!where Iam to get my samples." Mr. Silberberg then threatened to send for a policeman, and the plaintiff said, "You had better; and I'll take a seat and wait for him." The defendant then repeated that th plaintiff was " a damnation thief," and the next morning, whenibewent with an attorne's clerk to offer to go out as usual with the horse and chaise in the regular way of busdness, the defendant told him that he had been discharged for being a d- thief. This was the plaintiff's account of the slander, and the dismissal, for'which he now sought to recover damages. The defendant's story and that of his witnesses pat a totally different complexion upon the matter. According to their evidence the plaintiff had robbed the defendant of screws of tobacco, and, having been suspected of further peculation, a trap had been laid for him into which he had fallen. That when accused of having stolen the cigars he showed the most abject penitence, and that two years ago he had been remanded by an insolvency commissioner for 12 months for having contracted fraudulent debts. In short, without going into minute particulars, this was the real quesion left by the learned Judge to the jury-viz., taking the evidence as given on each aide, to wbich would they give the most credit? The summing up was somewhat lengthy, and each point in the case having been carefully dwelt upon by Mr. Justice Csnootetusn The jury retired at about 1 o'clock, and had not returned a verdict when the Court rose.
ADMIRALTY COURT, THURSDAY. MAY 28. THE PANAGflLA RH8OBCA OTHERN1SE TIM PAI'AGIA. RONGU.-CLATI FOn RESTITUTION OF SHIP, FREIGEXT, AND CARGO. (BeforeDr. LUS=TNTON.i The QUEEN'S ADVOCATE said that this case now caMe on for further proof. The vessel left Galatz on the 17th of September, 1855, laden with wheat, and bound for Syra, under Greek colours. She had also Wallachian and Servian colours on board, under which she had oriainlly sailed. She arrived at the Sulina mouth of the Danube on the 16th of October, and was captured on the 27th of November by Her Majesty's ship Dauntless, witbin two miles of Odessa, which had been blockaded since the 11th of February iu that year. She had a document on board caUed a log, but it consisted of a mere scrap of paper. A seaman, who ws the only witness examined, stated that the veseel struck on the bar of the Sulina mnouth of the Danube, and made so much water that he put into Odessa to save the ship and the lives of those on board. A claim was originaUy given in by Cosmos Tandarias, of GaUy, Acarnania, in Greece, but at present residing in WeUolose-square, on behalf of Constantine Fachary, of Syra, but at present residing at Galatz on the Dannbe, for the ship and freight. The cargo was claimed by Mr. Baltazzi, of 28, Great Winchesterstreet, on behalf of Gregorio John Cuppa, an Ionian sub. jeot, resident at Constantinople, the owner of one moiety, and on behalf of Messrs. Baltazzi, Sons, and Co., the owners of the other moiety. On behalf of the captors it was contended when tho case first camne before the Court that the veesel was not owned as claimed, but Mr. Tandarias was aUowed to amend his claim, and the captors were per. mitted to give furtber evidence as to the state of the leak. An amended claim had been given in by Mr. Tandarias, in which he alleged that himself and Gerasimus Karapanos, of Arta, in Roumelia, a Turkish subject, were the sole owners of the vessel in moieties, and that no Russian subject had any interest therein. It thus appeared from the amended claim that Mr. Tandarias was owner of one-half of the ship only. With regard to the necessity for entering Odessa, an affi. davit had been brought in on the part of the captors, made by a midsbipman, a carpenter, and a seaman belonging to Her Majesty's ship Dauntless, in which they deposed that they made a careful examination of the vessel, and especiaUy with reference to the leak; that they found such leak to be in the port bow above the water line, and consequently in a situation to be of no material importance unless in a very heavy sea, and that the vessel had then only 14 inches of water im the hold, and made only about two inches of water per hour; that they tried the pump, and found she was easily kept free by an occasional spell once or twice a day. A little caulking having been done, which might have been effected by the crew of the captured vessel, she was despatched from Odessa to Con. stantinople owith a prize crew, and arrived there in six days in perfect safety. The evidence adduced on the other side was a mere tissue of misrepresentations. The cargo he (the Queen's Advocate) submitted mnst share in the guilt of the The AD'MIRALTY ADVOCATE followed on the same side, and contended that if the vessel were really in danger from the leak there were three other ports which she might have entered with greater facility than Odessa. Dr. ADAMS, on the part of the claimants, submitted that the Coart, on the further proof, must be satisfied that the vessel belonged to the persons by whom she was now claimed-namely, Mr. Tandarias and Mr. Karapanos. There was an affidavit showing that it was under an entire misapprehension that the ship was originally claimed on behalf of Mr. Fachary. There had been a nominal sale to him, and hence it was thought that the claim must be in his name. With respect to the vessl proceeding to Odessa, it must be presumed that she would not have gone to a blockaded port unless under imperative necessity. There might have been another leak than that deposed to by the captors, but which had been stopped, as was frequently the case, by some process for which no one could account. Whether she could have entered into other ports with greater facility than Odessa depended on the weather, the currents, &c. 1E the Court was not satisfied with the reason a11eged for the vessel being found at Odessa, how could that affect the cargo ?-" The Mercurius," 1 Rob., 84.

C OOURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghallklrce4 May 28. IN RE FOSCOLO. I (Before Mr. ComMiSiOwner EvANs.) rue bankrupt was a corn-merohant of Dunster-court, Mincing-lane. His accounts have been published in The 2i-es. This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Lawrance appeared for the bankrupt; Mr. Wright appeared for the assignees. His HONOUR awarded a second class certificate. IN RE C. HIGGLNS. The bankrupt was a brewer of Salisbury. His accounts show-unsecured creditors, 3.4771. ; creditors holding security, 8 5651.; property held by creditors. 7,0001.; ditto under a bil of sale, 2,0001.; cood debtors, 7351. This was the examination meeting. Mr. Taylor appeared for the assignees. The bankrupt examined, deposed that in May, 1856, he had executed a bill of sale over the whole of his property, except his book-debts, in favour of his brother-in-avW. He believed he was solvent at the time; it might appear now, however, that he was not then solvent. He was asked to give security, and he could not do otherwise. His HONOUR allowed the bunkrupt to pass upon his n- dertaking to fmrnish a statement showing his actual position at the time in question.
POLICE. GUILDIALL.-James Wiliams was placed at the bar before Alderman HumpsrEty, charged with stealing a gold watch, value 141., from the person of a Mrs. Graves, of Kentish-town. Committed for trial. Rebecca Jones, the young girl who was remanded from Monday last upon a charge of attempting to commit suioide brtaking oxadc acid, was brought up from Newgate by direction of Sir P. LAURIE, who said that he had considered her case since she was last before him, and, having an opportunity of placing her in an excellent institution-the House of Occupation-ho thought she could not be better provided for. Every care would be taken of her, and she would be instructed in such duties as would eventually obtain Ler a good situation. Many girls who had left that esta. Iulishment had been placed in capital situations, where they had saved as much as 2001. At all events, she would have a comfortable home until she was better able to take care of herself. Arrangements were then made with Mrs. Campbell, the woman who brought the case under the magistrate's notice, to take the girl to the House of Occupation, and Sir Peter Laurie gave her a letter to the chaplain of the institution to obtain her immediate admission. We are requested to correct an error in our report of the case against May, Taylor, and Myers for conspiracy, in which the witness Hairby was made to say, " I recoUect the goods coming in and going to Meeking's " which should avebeen, - J.I recollect the goods being deivered at Taylor's and forwarded to May's warehouse. Neither Mr. Taylor nor I knew that they went to Aleeking's until this affair came out." BOW-STREET.-Sir Richard Mayne, the Commissioner o Police, attended before Mr. JARDINE to support a warrant taken out against James Casey, a man of about 40 yearg of age, who was charged with having threatened his life. The defendant, it appeared, was formerly a sergeant in the R divsion of poHce, and, having been dismissed from the service in November last, he used certain language in reference to Sir Richard whioh led to his being bound over at the Greenwich police-court to keep the peace for 12 months. Failing to get the required sureties, he was committedby the nuagistrate in defanlt, but, owing to the intercession of Sir lichard, was liberated (on a promise of good behaviour for the fture) before the expiration of the Allan H. Gorman, a police pensioner, deposed that he saw the defendant loiterng about Scotland-yard on Wednesday afternoon, near the office of the Police Commissioners. Hecame up to witness and said, "Do you know when Mayne wiU come in or go out? I want to meet him.' Witness advised him not to speak to Sir Richard, telling him that if he had anything to say it would be better to write a letter. He replied, " O)h, that is of no use ; I will see him." Witness tried to dissuade him from this intention, and said, " I was sorry to see by the newspapers that you threatened Sir Richard on a former occasion and got into trouble through it." The defendant answered, " I did not intend to kill him, bat I shall do something worse, that will' make him miserable for life ; that is what I mean to do." Witness again remonstrated with him, bat he continued in the same threatening rsanner, saying, " A prison is better t.han a workhouse; my wife and family are starvIng." Witness felt it his duty to comumunicate what passed to Sir Richard Mayne, believing that the defendant intended to do him some bodily harm. The defendant was formerly in the police, but had been dismissed. Police-constable 19 A deposed that he had seen the defendant loitering about Scotland-yard repeatedly for some time past. Sir Richard would have to pass him on leaving or going to the offlice. Sir Richard Mayne stated that proceedings were taken against the defendant in November last, in consequence of some violent and threatening language used by him on the I occasion of his being dismuissed from his situation; bat, owiag to a letter Mwhioh he addressed to witness during his confinement in Maidstoue Gaol, expressing his contrition for the past and begging to be liberated for the sake of his family, ne (Sir Richard) interposed on the man's behalf, andhe ws let out of prison long before the expiration of the term for which he had been comamitted. The defendant requested that his letter to Sir Richard might be produced, and it was accordingly read by Mr. Burnaby, the chief 'derk. Sir Richard felt, from the renewed threats uttered by the defendant, notwithstanding his promise never to moleAst himl again, that he contemplated somle act of violence, and tRa hiS (Sir Richard's) life wAas in danger. Th'Pe defendant said the airst witness had entirely misscop. stiru.d his ueanling,.I u sed ltO thresAteging lsn"@ca towards Sir Richard Mayne, and all that passed had refer. enoe to lis former state of feeling. He only told the witnes3 what he meant to have dene at that time. He did not allade to the present at all, for he still entertained the sen. timents expressed in his letter to Sir Richzrd. Mr. JARDL-M said the defendant had abused the indulgence maniEested towards him by Sir Richard. If be had ever meant to keep his promise of good behaviour he would have kept away from Sotland.yard altogether. IHe most nOW find bail, himself in iflOl. and two sureties i 751. each, to keep the peace for 12 months. The Sdefendant was committed to prison for a year in MAILBOROUGuHSTRE'r.-Tames Bnrke, who described himself asrecently from Tipperary, was brought before Mr. BINGH&ss, chaedwith the folowing daring robbery:- Edward William Harrison, assistant to John Perry, jewelUer, 40, Oxford-street, said, about lOo'clock the previons night he was in the shop, when he heard the shop window suddenly smashed. He rushed out, and saw the prisoner with both hands through a large hole, which had jast been broken in the glass. The prisoner pulled out a cruet-stand, worth .Os., but before he could make his escape witness seized him and, the police coming up, the prisoner submitted without making resistance. The prisoner had got a step or two from the front of the shop before he was secured. Police-constable Veney, 0 78, said he received charge of the prisoner. At the station-house the prisoner said he committed the offence through want. No money was found in his possession. The prisoner was ordered to be fully committed on this charge. The prisoner was then charged with having attempted to murder the gaoler of this court. George Welch, the gaoler, stated that when he went to the lock-up cell to fetch the prisoner, for the purpose of glacing him at the bar, the prisoner suddenly seized him y the neckkerchief, twisted his hand round, and while strangling him beat him with his other fist aboat the head and face. The attack was so sudden and unexpected, and complainant was so confused by the apprehension that the other prisoner in the same cell would take advantage of the attack to make their escape, that instead of defending himself he directed his efforts towards closing the cell-door which at last was accomplished. By this time he vwas nearly exhausted and msensible, and the prisoner was tightening bis grasp, when fortunately the messenger and some constables who were above were made acquainted with what was doing below, and they immediately came to his rescue and secured the prisoner. isome time after this the police came to the ceB to see if they knew the prisoner. The prisoner swore that he would dash the brains out. Of any on% who entered the cel, and, arming himself with a pewter pot which was In the cell, stood ready to strike the first constable who appeared. The cell-door was flung open, and police-sergeant Rogers, seeing the ferocious attitude of the prisoner, rushed in upon him, and, after a sharp and short struggle, took away his weapon and aseisted in handcuffing him. In defencs the prisoner said he had been pretty well paid out by the police for any injury he might have done to the gaoler. The assault was included in the depositions and the prisoner was fully committed. Edward Crawford, whose real name is Mlunday, was brought up for final examination, charged with the following daring robbery:- The prisoner went into theshopof Mr. Duve, a watch maker inhl addox-street, ontheevening of the 11th inst., and inquired the price of a gold watch in a tray of watches in the window. Mrs. Dave took the tray from the window and showed the watches. The prisoner took the tray from her, but she regained possession of it and placed it on the glass case on the counter. While she had hold of the case the shop door was suddenly flung open and something was stolen. The prisoner instantly wrenched the tray from her hand and ran out of the shop, but not before she had struck his wrist and thus caused two of the watches to fall on the floor. The prisoner made his escape with four gold watches. Police-sergeant Crocker, C 9, from the prisoner's description, took him into custody. The prisoner, who has been convicted of burglary, was yesterday defended by hlrs. Lewis, of Ely-place, who set upsa case of mistaken identity. Mrs. Duve's son, a very intelligent boy, and another wit-ness sswore positively to the prisoner, who was fully committed. W'EsTssrER.-On Wednesday last Charles Cannon, a very respectable-looking middle-aged man, described as a law writer, was charged with having violently assaulted Ann, his wife, a woman whose slatternly and dissipated appearance, unimproved by a severe black eye, denoted a person commonly addicted to drink. Complainant said that she had been married to the defendant upwards of 20 yeasn. On the previous night she was with her husband in Prince's-strett, Westminster, when he gave their little boy 6d. to buy some bread with; but, as she did not exactly want bread at that moment, she stooped to take it away from the child, when her husband struck her a blow on the eye with his stick, which knocked her down, and he then kicked her. He had fractured two or three of her ribs some weeks ago. The policeman proved a portion of the assault. The defendant said that his was a most pitiable condition. He wished to maintain his wife and family in credit and respectabiltv, but she was so inveterate a drunkard that she was not sober one day in the week. He entreated the m;agistrate to send to his home, and he would find that chairs, tables, cups and saucers, and everything he had possessed had been disposed of by his wife to procnre drink. Whenever he took offa dirty shirt she immediately sold it, and he had to replace it with a new one. After squandering a sovereign which he gave herfor thefamily, she camneto him for 6d. to bny bread, and he had no sooner given it to one of the children when she attempted to take it away from him to get more gin with, when, maddened by her disgraceful conduct, he forgot himself and struck her. Complainant, who in consequence of her noisy interruption had been ordered to leave the court, was recalled by the magistrate, but was found in a publichouse in the neighbourhood instead of remaining in attendance in the waiting-room. She coolly admitted that she got drunk sometimes. It was proved by the police-sbeet she was frequently seen in a state of intoxication, but was sober on Tuesday nIr. ARNOLD confessed that he had great difficulty in knowing how to act in this case. The present defective state of the law did not enable poor persons to obtain a separation, which could be done by the rich, or the defendant would certainly be entitled to be removed from the society of such a woman as the complainant, and she from his violence, provoked, as it mightbe, by her misconduct. 'Until some power was given to magistrates, or other tribunals, to separate persons in the humbler walks of life, thero was no chance of putting an end to such cases as the present, which sooner or later terminated in fatal results. VJefendant was ordered to find bail till the police had made some inquiries which the magistrate directed. THAmEs.-Joseph Wilson, a private in the 14th Light Dragoons, was charged with a murderous assault upon Sarah King, a dressmaker, residing at No. 14, Mulberrystreet, Whitechapel. Poce-constable Martin King, of the K division, said that about 12 o'clock the preceding night he was on duty in Whitechapel, when he heard the cry of " murder" in a female voice. He ran to the house from which the alarm proceeded, when he found the panels of the street door btroken. He went through it, and proceeded towards a room in which he heard a scuffle. EHe there saw a woman and the prisoner. The woman's face presented an apnearance showing that she had been most dreadfully assaulted Her face was covered with blood, and her eyes were blackened. She was taken to the London Hospital. (The witness produced a certificate from the hospital, which was to the effect that she was in much danger.) Mr. YARDLEY.-What sort of a house is it in which the complainant resides? Constable.-lt is a respectable house, Sir. The constable added that in the house he had a desperate struggle with the prisoner, and that when he got him into the street he was only overpowered upon obtaining the assistance of another policeman. Mr. YA RDL1Y.-Did he say anything? Policeman.-Yes, Sir. He said that when he left England to go on service, he allowed her 201. a-year, and that on his return he found she had taken up with another man. He admitted having assaulted her, and said he wculd do more, if he even suffered the law for it. Mr. YARDLEY remarked that he found from the medical certificate that the woman was in danger, and he directed Sergeant of Police K 7 to let him know, if there should be a necessity for him to go to the hospital to take her evidence. The prisosier was remanded for a week. SOUHwAR-Daniel Connell, a well-known character, was finally examined, charged with stealing 41. in silver from the till in the shop of George Holand, 83, Charlottestreet, Blackfriars.road. The magistrate committed him for trial.

MEETING OF MIDDLESEX MAGISTBATES A meeting of the magistriy of Middlesex was held yes. terday at the Sessions-house, CT,rkenwell, for the despatch of the county business; Mr. PowwNaLL in the chair. Thero Was a full attendance of magistrates. The minutes of preceding Courts having been read, The County Treasurer, who acted for the deputy clerk of the peace, laid before the court certain bils and papers presented to Parliament likely to affect the interests of the county, The CH.ncrAN called attention to the Election Expenses Bill introduced by Lord Robert Grosvenor, which, if passed, woald throw the expenses of elections upon counties and boroughs. He thought it was a very singular measure for one of the members of the county to bring into the House, and that, as the guardians of the county purse, the bench should refer the proposed measure to the Committee for General Parposes with the instruction to take sauch steps as to them might seem desirable in the matter. - Mr. FREw said, he had had some experience of what county elections were, and he thought the magistrates ought to take notice of this Bill, and petition against it, espcially as what Middlesex did probably would he followed as an example by other counties. The Bill was then referred to the committee. PROPOSED NEW COUNTY PRISON. in their report of the condition of Coldbath-fields Hoase of Correction the vWisiting magistrates said:- "The expectatonc expremed by them in their form report, that the number of prisoners would diminish, had not been realied. and that, having frequently brought under the notioe of the Court the urgent ntesesity which existed fortee kantg measie to mneet the dillicultr, they had felt It to be, their duty to direc the mirryoar of the county, brdges, ac., to prepare a plan Ly wbich encreased accommodation n.lght be ptovideod for 250 addtutional proners." The report went on - The visting justices agin call the attenuou of the Cout to this subject, and beg to late teat as the prson now ontains the un- preoLdnetednumotr of670 prisoners, a number from which thley le.r there is nio rs.scoabhohpe of decrease, but, oni the oDntrary, that It wi. be still further augmented, they dsir to saic the deliberate opinion of the court upon the alternative whichL is presented to them. of enlarging the presnt building, or of erecting an entirey new prison onx a suitable waantity of land within the county and pear to a ralway o tay - tion. Th visiti-g jsticeswould recommend the aPPointment bh the CoDurt oraspetialoDmmittee, not only tocons.lder thb reeentproposed~ or any other plan of alterAtion, but the larger question as to whether it wouldnot be more for the interest of the ounty tobuid a new tstablishment elsewhere, and dispose of the present prison sod ita site, the time having arrived when further delay cannot with saety to the discipline or heslth of the priODn be allowed." They could not estimate the expense of providing the additional accommodation required at Coldbath-fields at less than 16,0001. This portion of the report was ordered to be circulated amnong the magistrates, and to be taken into consideration next Court day. From the other reports it appeared that there were in Westminster Bridewell 888 prsoners, and in the House of Detention 225, giving, with the number in Cold-bath-fields, a total of A783. COLNEY-HATCH ASYLUM. Mr. WAR&-ER mnoved that the committee of the ColneyHatch Asylam be authorized to expend a sum not exceeding 7,000!. to defray the expenses of alterations and repairs which had become necessary in consequence of the original defective construction of the building, and also the expense incurred by the committee in obtaining professional advice relating thereto. After some discussion it was resolved That this Court requires a detailed report of the alterations and rear ecsaya teCounts As,lum at (Jlsey Siath, wnth an fohr3D suchexpenditunre the committee may authorhiizfor any urgent The County Treasurer was diretekd to pay a sum not exceeding 1,600L for such repairs as the committee might The other business was of a merely formal character.

A NEw PRBEEnm-The Edinburgh Express reports the appearance of a lay preacher named Mr.. Brownlow North, who has begun to make a great sensation. from various Free Church and Baptist pulpits. He is a member of an aristocratic family, appears to be upwards oE 40 years of age, and, until a few months ago, was a man of fashion " about town," given to sporting and the more common forms of time-kiUing prevalent among the upper class " He was then (says the JSh:prcss) brought to a knowledge of the truth, and straightway became as active in the evangelistic as he had previously heen in the sporting field. Beginning in the &berdeen and Elgin pulpits, he has been. gradually making his way south; and his ministry has been attended in some cases with the most remarkable results. HIe has been calDed the ' Northern Spurgeon'"' A SwI;eDmINa F<BAT,-A swiEmming feat of rather a novel character, which occasioned considerablo excitement among the undergraduates and others who assembled to witness it was performed in the river Isis, at the conclusion of the Univerasty eight-roared races, on Monday last, Thefeat originated in an offer to lay 25& to 11. that an umdergraduate, well known in the University, could not, clotbed n thick trousers, heavy boots, and a jersey, swim from the' Christ Church barge to the white w ow opposite Wyatt's, at Iffley. The wager was made, and at exactly S o'clock the swimmer, accompanied by friends of both parties, in. boats, commenced his task. As no specified time was named for its accomplishment, the gentleman swam very quietly, occasionally resting his arms by floating on his back, Theweather had been very warm during the day, buta fresh breeze had now sprung up, and rendered the air very chilling. Soon after passng the Long Bridges he experienced an attack of cram, which it was feared wou.d.. compel him to resign his task. By a great effort, however, he oiereame it, as be did also one or two snbseeuent at- tack; and continued leisurely on his course, arriving at his. destination amid the hearty cheers of the assembled spectators, having completed the distance, one mile and A quarter, in 6 minutes. The gentleman on landing showed but little signs of fatigue, and, without sstopping to change his clothes, started back to Oxford at brisk run.-Ozfor&.
