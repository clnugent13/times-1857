The Bill was then h read a second time. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL. Mr. ADDERLEY moved that the House go into coam anittee on this Bill. Sir G. GREY hoped that the hon. member would only go into committee preoferd, in order to have the amendments of which he had given notice printed. The Bill -was one of .;Zeat importance, and thongh he should be sorry to StAnd in the way of its being corsidered is committce, he thought wsuJcent time ought to be given to ascertn the opinion of bcards of guardians throughout the country regarding it. Tia right ion. friend the President of the Poor Law Board and the Chaneellor of the Duchy of Lancaster took a deep Interest iathe question, and he hoped that they would have ain oppotunity of fully conidering al the details of the measure. Mr. MILES also booed that the Bill would be postponed Qo give time to the iloor Law guarians throughoet the country to consider its details, Mr. GREGORY had no desire to oppose this Bill, but he 'was anxious to see it cleared of all suspicion of tampering -'with the religious feelings and principles of poor children. ol' nat portion of the Bil which affected the Poor Law he -would leave to English members, hut, as an Irish member, *e wished his e on. friedd to introduce a clause which would lull the suspicions of those who feared that under the provisions of the Bill the religion of poor cbildren maight be tampered -with. He ;inow his han. friend had no intention to interfere with the --relDion of those to be dealt with by the Bill; but there wnigat be ardent spirits among the uanagers of schools who -would not be so scrupulous, and he thought Stafford was mear e fough to Warwickshire to make one uncomfortable -on the subject. (A laugh.) He hoped his hon. friend -would endeavour to obviate al objections on this score, and 'that he wvould make the Bill instead of a contention and a snare, a blessing to the poor classes for whose benefit it was introduce. Be had an amaendment on the paper to post. Houone the committee on the Bil for thae montbs, hut he would withdraw it in favour of the amendment of the noble lord the member for the West Riding, which was, that it ile postponed for only tbree weeks, Lord GODERICrb rose to move his amendment that the House should resolve itself into committee on the Bill that day three weel-s. He had naothing to say against the object -of the measur, which was to educate -and reform vagrant 'chidren ; butt there might be stated grave objections to the 3machinery by which the object was to he carried out. He wvould at present give no positive opinion on that subject, ,but certainly the machinery was of a character to require -the utmost con8ideration. The Bill proposed tomake altera-tions in the existing Poor Law, and therefore all who managed and paid the poor rates ought to have time to conaider the nature of those alterations. It proposed, in the first place, to give power to the justices before whom vagrant -children were taken to send those children to schools eatsblished in connexion with the Bill, and if in their judgment the parents of the children were usable to pay for them, 'hey had power to order either the board of guardians or the overseers to pay for the children out of the poor-rates. This took away al] power of discretion from the guardians and transferred it ro the justices. In the eecond place, the BiU pro osed, as far as it went, to repeal the law of settle'mnent. He had no objection to the repeal of the law of set-tlement if it were done universally, but there were many -objectinns to its being repealed in the partial way proposed by the Bil. In the third place, it was pro. vided that the parents of a child might be summoned by -the guardians on whom the order had been made before 'the lustices; and if, on examination into the circumstances -of those parents, the iustices thought them unable to maintn the child, then tey could at discretion order him to be supported out of the poor funds; or, on the other hand, Ncomnpel the parents to pay for the child if they found them able to do so. This not only removed the discretion from -the guardians, but it would give direc' encouragement to oor arents to allow their children to become vagrants. hey had only to satisfy two justices that they could not -maintain their children, and the latter would be maintained and educated at the expense of the public. These were important changes, and he therefore thought ample time -should be given to consider them by al who were interested. He accordimgly moved that the House go into committee on the Bill that day three weeks. Mr. ADDERLEY said that, as it seemed to bethe general 'wish of the House that the Bil ahould be postponed, he had no objection to that course, provided that it were allowed to go into committee pro los-d to afford him an -opportunity of inserting the amendments of which he had gsven notice, so that they might he reprinted with the Mfr. BAINES said be was favourable to the Drinoiple of the Bill, and was anxioe-s to seo some measure passed on the subject ; but in its Dresent crude shape it would give rise to a great deal of useliss discussion, which might he avoidf d by acceding to the propositlon for the postponement of the Bill. There were several points of detail on which the -promoters of the Bill did not appear to have made up their 3minds, and it was of great importance, before any discuseion took place in committee, that the various boards of guardians throughout the country should have an opportu. x-ity of considering the BiUl in its matured shape. Mr. ROEBUCK called upon the Government, whose -duty it was to watch how laws were made in that House, -either to take the Bil out of the hands of the hon. member for North Staffordshire, or to declare that they could not -give their support to any Bil framed as thiswas. The -measure was of too great importance to be left to a private -Member, and the Government would have pursued a much more manly and straightforward course had they ehosen one of the two alternatives which he bad suggested, instead of taking advantage of the motion of the noble lord -*he member for the West Riding to get rid of it altogether by a side wind; for that, in fact, would be the effect of postponing the Bill for three weeks. (Hear, hear.) MIr. KENDALL also urged postponement. Mr. PALK said that the objections which he had origi. ,1ally expressed to the Bill had been strengthened on reflection, and he was therefore in favour of postponement, in ,order that its provisions might be fuly known through. -out the country. Mr. R. PALMER pointed out that on that day three vweeks several very important orders of the day were to -come on-, anyd suggested that the postponement should be -until that day four woeeks, - r. ADDERLEY assentedto this proposal, and, The amendment having been withdrawn, the House went into committeeo ro forind on the Bill. In committee, Mr. BARROW drew the attention of the Government -to the manner in which the Bill would interfere with the avw of settlement all over the country. For instance, any Irish children found begging in an English parish might be -abut up in an industril school at the charge of that parish -for an indefinite time. The amendment of the hon. member for Worth Stafford- shire having been inserted, and the Bill as amended ordered to be reprinted, the House resumed, when the Bil was ,ordered to be recommitted on the 17th of June. JUDGMENTS EXECUTION, &c., BILrL. On the order of the day being read for going into com>mittee on this Bill, Mr. BLAND asked the hon. member for Ayr, who3 had 'charge of the Bill, to postpone it until after the other -orders, as most of the Iriah members were absent attending 4 deputation toothe noble lord atthehead of the Government <on a very important subect, Sir W. GREY vointed out that this was impossible, as the order of the oay for going into committee had beens lead.~~~~~~~~~~~~~a Tho House then. went Into eommittee, on claus" 1 Mr. BLAND moved that the Chairman report pro. aress, Tho numbers vwere- For the motion ... ... 10 Against it' .. . 137 iMajority against the motion --1X On clause 1,1 MJr. SPOONER said that he feared tho Bill might favour fr3nd, aDd therefore proposed to introduce an amendment limiting its operation to adverse judgments. Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD assured the hon. momber that his fear Tfas groundless, and Mr. SPOONER, with the permission of the Committee, withdrew his amendment. Colonel FRENCH moved that the chairman should roport progress, ar d ask leave to sit again. The Committee divided, and tho numbers were- Ayes ... ... ... ... ... 11 N.es ... .... ... 151 Majnrity ... --140 The motion was therefore lost. Mr. BLAND objected to the first claue. Ie should divide the Committee against it, and if he succeeded in striking it out of the Bill should move the insertion of another, which would give these judgments only the same force as a warrant of attorney or a confessed judgment. Mr. AYRTON objected to the clause as informal and untechnicaL The Committee divided on the question that hausa 1 should stand part of the BilL The numbers were- Ayes ... ... ... ... ... 137 Noes ... ... ... ... ... 4.3 aLjority ... ... .... -94 The clause was therefore agreed to. In clause 1 the word "final" was introduced, with the consent of the hon. member who had charge of the Bill so as to define the judgment to which the measure was to refer. Mr. AYRTON made a similar objection to this clause as that which he raised to the previous one. It was not his intention to divide the House; but the Bill, as it at present stood, appeared to him to contain an anomaly as great, as it would enable an action to be commenced on the common law side and judgment on it to be taken on the equity side. He hoped the learned Lord-Advocate would inform the House whether, in his opinion, this clause carried out the principle. The LORD-ADVOCATE expressed his belief that the clause in the Bill would have precisely the same effect as that proposed by the hon. gentleni'an, and in his opinion it was preferable of the two. Mr. DEBSY pointed out that judgments of courts of equcity, which often affected the payment of large sums of money, were not referred to in the Bill. Changes in the law relating to land in Lreland had alao been made of late years, and he should have liked to see a Bill introduced by the hon. and learned Attorney-General for Ireland, who was well acquainted with the course of recent legislatsion upon that subject, instead of a measure brought in by a private member, and framed in complete ignorauce of the existinlgstate of things with regard to the effect of judgment Mr. ROEBUCK complained that in considering ameasu-e to alter the law of the three kingdoms the House had not the assistance of the Attorney-Ceneral for England as well as that of the Attorney-General for Lreland and the learned Lord Advocate. A Bill ought to havy been brought in on the authority of those three gentlemen if brought in at all, and not by a prvate member. He hoped that the prerent Bil would be, as it had been on a former occasion, kicked out with the contumaely which it deserved. (A laugh.) Mr. WHITESIDE regretted that the hon. gentleman should have brought in a bill which, with all deference to him, would affect subjects which he did not understand. The effect of the measure would be to complicate the transfer of land in Ireland, which at present was comparatively easy. Mr. NAPIER considered that to continue the discussion was a waste of time, and he therefore moved that the Chairman report progress. Mr. FITZGERALD supported the clause Mr. MALINS considered that the discusdon could more conveniently be taken upon a subseonent clause of the BilL The Bill simply proposed that a judgment obtained in England should, if properlyregistered, bave effect'as a judgment in Ireland, and, as the laws of both countries were substandially the same, he for one could see no valid objection to such an enactment. That the law should have so lonu existed by which a contrary result was produced he i-egardea as a great anomaly in the case of tvwo nortions of the empire ishich were bound together by the closest ties. He could not allow that the CircuMstRL f'be lBill having been introduced by a private member war X ood reason why it should he rejected, and, although the hei3. gentleman who had brought it iu satupon the opposite sideof the House, he (Mr. malins), believing its principle to be a just one, should give it his bese support, Mr. BUTT said that his objection to the Bill would to a great extent be removed if it were provided that notice should, under its operation, be given to a person in one country who might have a judgment obtained in anotber registered against him, that such a proceeding had taken place. He should also vish to see power given to the courts of law in England, Ireland, and Scotland, in the case in which a cause originating in one country was attempted to bo tried under the Bill in another, to refer the question for trial to the courts of the country from which it came. Colonel FRENCCH suggested that the Government should take the advice which bad been given them in reference to the Bill by the hon. member for heffteld, amnd should more caretully consider its provisions. Mr. NAPIER said that after what had faLen from his hon. and learned friend the member for Cork (Mr. Deasy) and other hon. and learned members, to the effect that the Bill, instead of carrying out an advantageous principle, would introduce confusion into the legal system in Ireland, he felt it to be his plain duty to continue his opposition to the measur. The LORD-ADVOCATE thought his hon. and learned friend the member for Ayr deserved great credit for the perseverance with which he had conducted the BiUl through the House, and, feeling satisfied with itsprovisions so far as they bore upon the laws of Scotland, should vote against the motion for reporting progress. Mr. WHITESIDE said that in his opinion fraudulent executtios-of which there were many instances-would be greatly promoted under the operation of the BilL After a few observations from Mr. MALiS, The committee divided, and the numbers were- Ayes... ... ... ... ... ... 89 N oes ... ... ... I- ... ... ... 1S7 Majority against reporting progress --98 Mr. AYRTON said that, considering the very different opinions which prevailed as to the merits of the Bill among hon. members competent to form a judgment in the matter, he should suggest that the BiU be referred to a select committee of lawyers, who, as the subject was of an entirely legal character, could best investigate its details and bring them into a satisfactory shape. Mr. P. O'BRIEN said, it was obvious, from the frequent divisions upon this bill, that the Irish members were usanimous in opposing it. He would, therefore. recommend its further progress to be postponed until the Irish judges had been communicated with as to its effect in Ireland. Mr. L. BLAND should take the opinion of the committee upon this clause. The laws of Scotland were so uninteUtl gible that he could not consent to allow the decrees of the Scotch courts to run into England and Ireland. The committee divided- For the clause ... ... ... ... 179 Aainst it ... ... ... ... ... 92 hijorsty ... ... ... ... -87 The clause was then agreed to. On clause 3, providi*g that no copy of a judgment shal issue without rule of court or judge's order or certificate, Mr. M'CANNN said, it was five years since he first opposed this bill. It was said that the biU had been greatly improved, and if the hon. and learned member (Mr. Craufurd) would give the Irish members another year to look over the Scotch law perhaps they might agree to it. If the Bil had been wanted by the mercantile community there would have been petitions in its favour. Mr. AYRTON said that the clause as it stood deprived litigants of the right of having a copy of the judgment in an action or suit of the superior courts. Mr. CRAUFURD thought that the words " as aforesaid" in the clause met the objection. Mr. ROEBUCK suggested that the clause should be negatived, with the view to its amendment atS a fatre stage. After a short conversation, Tlhe clause was negatived. On clause 4, hlr. DEASY proposed an amendment, the effect of which would be to prevent executions under t;his Bill unless a formal application erer made to the court out of which it was sought to be issued, and proof given that the debt and costs included in the original judgment had not been paid. __ Mr. CRAUFURD opposed the amendment as unnecessary. The Committee divided- For the amendment ... -... ... ... . 9 Against 't ... .. .. .. . 6 %ZrIaoty ..... ... ..." ... ... 163 The amendment was therefore negatived, Mr. AYRTON said the clause would necessitate tho openingjof threeiregistries of judgments, thus tripling the existing expenses connected with the registration of judgments. He tbought the mere addition of the letter I or S, as the case might be, to the entry of Irish and Scotch judgments in the existing registry would fully answer the object of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Craufurd). Mr. BLAND apprehended that, as the Scotch law was a fusion of law and equity, the Scotch decreets would enable Scotch creditors to obtain execution for equitable as well as legal demands, and if so they would have an advantage over nglish and Scotch judgments, because underthelatter merely legel and not equitable demands could be recovered. He ssonln like to hear the hon. and learned member for Wallingford (mr. halins) express his opinion upon this point, as he had adverted to it on a previous occasion. Mr. MALINS said he had considered the point, and was now of opinion that a juLdgment obtained in Scotland against the estate of a debtor in England or Ireland ought to be enforced againat that estate, provided the judgment were obtained by a roce analogous to that resorted to in England and Ireland. He could not perceive the force of the objection of the bon. member for the Tower Hamlets, because even under the existing law searches had to he made in the English registry office for the purpose of as. certaining whether a judgment had been obtained against a man in Ireland or Sootland. The clause w agred to, a were also clauses 5 and 6. Upon clause 7, iMr. BLAND moved that the chairman report progress. Colonel FRENCH hoped that before the Bill again eame before them theGovernment wouldreooider theco Irsethey vere taking. He thought the Irish members, 105 i numlxr, who, with one solitary exception, were aU oppo.d ta the BiL had grave eawe to complain of the Government i'OC fcrcing this measure upon them. The motion Was then agreed to. 'Eho House resunmed, and the chairman reported pro- BURIAL ACTS AMENDMlENT BILL. This Bil was read a second time. CHATHAM LANDS, &c., BILL. The Eouse went into committee on this BiU. The various clauses, 24 in number, were read by Mr. Fitzroy and agreed to with a rapidity which seemedgreatly to amuse the new members, and they loudly cheered the rgoht hen. gentleman for the specimnen of "quick work" he hadthus afforded ELECTIVE FRANCHISE REGISTRATION. Mr. T. DUNCO IBE obtained leave to bring in a BLU to facilitate and afford more frequent opportunities for the gstration of the elective franchise in England aud Wailes. The BiM was afterwards brought up and read a first time. SLAVE TRADE (CUBA). Sir G. B. PECHELL moved for a return of Her Majesty's ships and vessels employed on the coast of Cuba for the supprewsion of the dlave trade, from the 1st day of January, 1854, stating tho dates of their arrival on and their departure from their respective cruising stations, with the names of their several ca tains and commanders, and distiguishlag steam from sau=ng vessels. The motion was agreed to. The hon. BARONET afterwards gave notice 'that he would call the attention of the House to this subject on Friday evening, upon going into Committee of Supply. CINQUE PORTS ACr AAENDMENT BILL. Mfr. WILSON obtaired leave to introduce a Bil for the amendment of the Cinque Ports Act. The Bill was afterwards brought up and read a first time. BLEACHING AND DYEING WORKS. On the motion of Mr. K7Rn, Mr. Davison was added to the committee on this subject. ADJOURNMENT- MRM SPOONER AND MAYNOOTH. Lord R. CECrL moved, pursuant to notice, that the House at its rising do adjourn til Friday. Mr. SPOONER, amid much laughter, begged to oppese this motion. No opposed motion can be made on Wednesdays after a quarter to6 o'clock, and as the dial already indicated this hour the effect of the hon. gentleman's opposition was that the noble lord's proposal could not be taken into consideration. ELECTION PETITIONS. Petitions complainiug of the elections at Finsbury, Lambeth, Bodmin, Dover, Weymnouth, Galway, Bath, and Cashel were referred to the General Committeeof FAections. The House adiourned at a few minutes before 6 o'clock. Colonel TYETn paired with Mr. LAuIur in favour of Mr. Faga's motion on Tuesd.y night.

THE MISAfANAGEAZ2V OP JUyL_BO., _ : DEPUTAT10N TO THE FIRST COMMSSO 0R p OFUBLIC Wfl1RTZ On Monday last a nttmerous degutation, consistig of joint body of the Vestry and Boar of Guardians of Mr *ebone, waited upon the First Commissioner oF Wor'ks i injamin Haali , ZHLP., at the Office of Works, Whitehail to reoquest his assistance, as a Minister of- the Crown and reprueoeqtative of the borough of Marylebone, in resisting the ,,terfe.'ence of the Poor.law Commissioners in the affairs of that par. sh, legal proceedings having been threatened by the GovernmL nt ord, owing to the lato expulsion of their inspector, b. Farnell, from the Board of Guardians. The deputktionocnsisted of Mr. ChurchwardenNicholay Messrs. Ohichbter, Hodges, Botting, Braes,s Cole, Taver. ner, Perry, Salknon, Andersoa, D'Iffgnger, jan., England, Brooks, King, holdend Hendry, and Coran, with Mr Greenwell, vestry clerk, and Mr. BaE, secretary to the Board of Guardians. Mr. NCrCroLA.Y, in addres the Chief Commissioner, said that the deputation, forme of the board of guardians and the vestry, attended in order to ask his aesistance and support, as they found themselverwin a difficulty. They vished to have his counsd and aid, or his sistance as a menmber of Her Majesty's Government, and they would appeal to him with confidence, knowing that hepoessedtbe confidence of the Government. They wre threatened (continued Mr. Nicholay) with the interferengeof the Poor Law Board; and, as a lover of local Eelf-government, which be hxd *hown himself to be in the construction of the 5Metropolis Local Management Act, they felt sure of Sir B. liBs assistance in resisting stch interferenoe. It was in his power, they felt sure, to interfere; for when threatened someyears Ego with the encroachments of the Poor Law Eoard Mr. B ume stepped forward to their awistance, and by waiting on the Pnme Ifinister, Sir Robert Peel, averted tbat evil. Mr. GRnesiwzr.Tz, the veary clerk, then read the correspondence which had recently taken _place between the parochial authorities and the Poor Law Board, in which the ex-Puion of Mr. Farnell, the inspector, was detailed, and the threatened legal procedingV by the Commissionersin the Court of Queen's Bench, in order to enforce the right of adission ofEtheir inspector, under the 9th and 10th of Victoria to the meetings of the board of guardians. Mr. HODGES thea addressed Sir B, Hall, request. lug his imniediate co-operation, both as their representative, as a legislator, and a Minister of the Crown, in resisting the interference of the Poor Law Board. He urged that, whatever might be the result of legal proceedings, the expenses would have to be paid out of the pockets of the tax.payers. either out of the consolidated fund on the one side, or the pockets of the ratepayers of Marylebone on the other, and bs attended with no good result; for at present the interference of the Poor LTa Board in the aXairs of the parish only tended to prodace great disorganization to the workhouse between the officers and paupers. In a parish containing 160,000 iRhabitants he considered the guardians did their duty ex ceedingly well; and amoDg V0,000 persons annually reheved, some complaints mnst be expected, even in the best managed establishments. He had not come to ask bni (Sir B. HaU) to excuse the guardians, but he had come from the vestry to ask him to use his power in checking the influenoe of the Poor LAw Board. He therefore wished him to give a atraightforward answer at once. Would he use his beat influence as a member of the House of Commons in putting an end to this interference on the part of the commIssioners with the parochial affairo Marylebone X Mr. TAVERNER, in next addressing Sir B. Hlall remarked that the vestry of Marviebone could never think of laying down their independence at the feet of the Poor Law Bard and placing their necks beneath the yoke of the Commisioners, and therefore he trusted the interview would not be in vain, but that they would obtain his assist. ance in relieving them from the threatened burden. Mr. CHICEgsTER observed, as one of the deputation and a vestryman, that Sir B. HaiU should know both eides of the question; and he believed the present interference arose on the part of the Government body from the fact that at the last elections of guardians able men had been rejected for that important post, and mnen wholly unfitted for the duties been elected in their stead. Sir B. HmE4 in his reply, was frequently interrupted by remarks and suggestions from vanons members of the deputation. He proceeded most carefully, by mean; of the blue-book of the House of Commons lately isued respecting the corrndence between the Poor Law Commissioners and the parochial authorities of Marylebone, to reviewthe whple facts of the dispute respecting the magement of affairs in the workhouse for the past nine months, and in doing so animadverted largely upon the disgusting disclosures exposed in the "woman flogiing case," andthe extraordinary conductof the board of guardians in failing to dismiss the prties concerned, or even acept the resignation of the master until four months had elapsed, and until they were threatened with a mandamus in the Court of Queen's Bench by the Poor-Law Commissioners. Sach was a case in which, had not the President of the Poor Law Board interfered aud ordered an in9uiry, he would have been officially most culpable, tne more especially as he had been requested to do so by the churchwarden (ar. Nicholy)- and that a communication from Mr. Broughton, condemning the scandalous outrage, had been forwarded to the Poor Law Board. Admitting that the unfortunate creatures who were so brutally treated were in the lowest grade, nothing could justify such brutality - but the board of guardians, by keeping the master in his situation notwithstadinrg he was roved to have been present when the girls were flogged, and when another was pulled out of a ceI by the hair of her head, did, in point of fact, palliate this outrage. Mr. HoDoGS observed that these ware circumstances they did not wish to touch upon. They had simply come as a deputation to know whetker or not Sir B. Hall would ve hastance in preienting the present irnterference of tlhe Poor Law Board, Sir B. HALL replied that he had no doubt these were very dsagreeable subjects, but he must recapitulate them, and he must add that this very master, who was retained to the last moment, and of whom the guardians expressed the highest opinon, excepting in this one instance, had stated that the workhouse "had been without a master for a great many years, during which both the nominal master and the House were governed by paupers, petty officers, and individual members of te Board," adding that the workhouse "had been for years the worst managed public establishment in the kiDgdom." After this the second case he would deal with was the report from the Lunacy Commissioners to the Poor Law Board respecting the treatment of the women and idicts in the workhouse. What could be more shocking to humanity than the treatment of theseswretched creatures bereft of reason by the Almighty? Among many allegations of the Lunacy Commissoners, there was oneoto the following effect, viz, that *Restraint a employed it the diasretion ot tbe wwramen and DOtg.eand eno da tsee kepn os repinort WaS cruelty and ponh lir. ANDEEtatIn, a t member of the board of guardians, remarked that ths nure in question afterwards denied the asserton. Sir Bi. HALL continued.-He was speaoing with the blaebokbefora him which contaimed the charge, and the fact was so Far conftrmed by tne oommittee themspves that they censured the ioman and threatened her with dismi. sa on a aepetmemn of th offence. gnderdthese ,it crmstancesd wa s it not the dutyi he wrould ask ad y sensible man, for the Poor Aw 'Board to interfere? Then the Poor Lawr Board sends an inspector to the board Sf guardians to speak on the asubect of the concition of the boane, but the bowhd of guardians edould have nothing to do wita fam-o, they orld not even take counml's opies on as to whether they were acting legally orotherwise, althodgh urgel to ro so by some of the most inteligentdmembers of thenathe o oor L Aw Board then sent a letter remonstrdiang with the guardkans, td ofiving themc a fortnight to reconsider their deterfmation ; but their answer was to the wieth him-no, they woul noth eeng tdwith youn; take yonr pr oweterhgs the we s freh actng lhegaely ootherwihese,lthoughn urged tont donso bypesoe,o the most ithelmlsigentm bers o hIr*HDC}}s interuptig, sad th t iwas this aggresthe bon arld. Theae expoorLasBa then wentedto prevent ort the Sir B. Hwth added ie felt bound to give his opinron, and i d estate of tdetSermylebone workbhouseirasnsounsastofateafe that describedin theiblte-booktprsonted to the Bhuse of Coremons he believed the Poor Law Board were bound to tike "aose steps in respect to the f ogging case, and t oake inqu ry into the state of the lunaics, whschnhe was bounnd to rsaten after the report presented to the Poor- Siw roard, showed thet theso poor creatures were in the most deplorable state.

The dputation then asked him to interfere as a member o de Legstatre, to prever t the interference of the Poor Law Bo rd. They need on this point huve nbs doubt that if ee sas the Poor Lawr Bord, or any other such body, in. cerferebu if they could witon now huow tor not beind compelunacso woinerfetreat he w sue tohere wand soul to prevent ot horo neferomence end ofhe the paris t the otgher.

Sir B. Hall then alluded ti the fact that the Poor Law Board, on tho report of the Lunacy Commissioners, had recommended the removal of the schools from the workhouse, to relieve its overcrowded state. This subject had been delaled by the parochal authorities for eight or ten years; but ho was hap y to think that now it would not be very much longer deferred. Mr. CncHICSTER sxnd Mr.TAvzRwzRshowedthat12,0001. had been voted by the vestry for the erection of schools and, perhaps, if the state of thiDgs was remedied as spoken of by Sir B. Hall, he would then, on their showing gool grotnds of amendment, give his support to the opposition to the Poor Law Board. Mr. HODGES reqnested Sir B. Hall to give them a definite answer. Would he, or would he not, resist the encroachments of the Poor Law Board in their parish ? Sir B. IHALL replied,-It appears to me that the Poor Law Board have interfered in two cases-first, as to the floeging of women in the workhouse, and next as to the state of the pauper lunatics. My opinion is that the cae of flogging the women in the workhouse has been most clearly proved. I think that the Poor Law Board, after the representations made to them, had really no option in the matter, and it became their duty to institute a strict inquiry into the circumstancei, which, in my opinion, were of a meot reprehensible ehater, and in which I believe eveybody concur With respect to the stabt of tho work- e, a described in the report of the Lunaey CommisI ione, I think aer sch a repor. hd4 ben made I to them the Poor Law Bocrd wrere boundto make inquiry. hc of the allegations st fortb in the report obe min;qsioncra is bullyqorrebcneed byt lb eort of the committee of the B:)ard of 6ctKdians appointed to coider it., t must say iisloses a state of circuzmtances of a most revolting character. Suchtismy oplniout ofE'the ca'tes in question now. fr JEODGFS.-WO cannot take back that fact. It has nothing to do with the deputation. The deputation does not ask ur opinion on these subjects, but Wants to know, wif You asg'st them in their efforts to keep out the Poor Law Board ? Sir B. H -I don't care whother you take my opinion back or not. Ifs,tall not shrink from iving my opinion upon anv subject £h.%t may be brought before me. lIr. BWODGES.-We donAt want you to speak of tho flog. gino of women. Sir B. HAL.-I sappo c xot; bDut I shall give my opinion, and if you tell me you decliie totakeitI shilsendit to your vestry clerk in writictj tir. HDono .-I cannot ta7 it bsolc as an answer to the vestry. The vestryr only >.llu6ss to Mr. FAMIl'a inter. ference. Sir B.

Ton aek ms now to interfere, and to request the Pow IAw Bard not to take anY further steps in the matter. All I CYm7 iS, I Am as averae to the interference of Goverment authority in the management of your affairs as any one ot you. As sooA as You show me that the matters complainsdt ofjro remedied, or that they are actualy in active coureswof zemsdy, I will, with tbe greatest pleasure, represent tle Oa to i- Poor law Board, and endeavour to provent any further interference in those matters." The deputation then thankea Sir B. Hal, x4* retird,. afer nearly three hours' conference.
BETEW AT CHA THAM BY THE DUZ. OF CAMBRrDOg~. A grand review of the whole of the troops quarteed' at this inortant garrison took plae yesterday, on Chatham Line, m the presence of the Conmacnder.in-Chiet anda other diatingaished officers. His Royal Highness held' a reTiew only a short time since at thib garrison and on Vit, occasion was so well satisfied with the reeuit of hi, in-, spection that be expressed his intention of holding snotliex review after a brief intervaL The day being beautifully' fine the appearance of the troop-upwards of 5,000 in nu ber-s they were formed on theLines, waveryatriking. His Royal Highknes left the Horse Guards at an early hour, and arrived by the first train from London. On reaching the station he- was received by Colonel W. H. Eden, commandant of the garrison, Mr. Prioe, the station-master, and the other officials of the company. His Royal HIghness, who wore the undrems and sash of a general, was accompanied' by Colonel C. Tyrwhitt, his aide-de-camp, and Colonel Foster, and on alighting from the train Drcedecl at once to Government.houssa, the resdence ofTCoeleEden,tosartake of a &jnetr which had been prepred for him n reaching the drawbridge croing the trenches a Royal salute of 2L1 guns wAa fired from a saluting battery by a party of gunners belonging to the Royal Marine LightInfantry. The whole of the troops were under arns at 9 o'clock, at which hour they marched to the lines for the purpoeof taking up their positions, The regiments of the e, com prumingte Provisional Battalion. occupied the centre of the column, their number being 2,500 men of all ranks. The variety of costume of the varioits dep6ts, which includedtheHighlanders anadRifles, hsdapeculiareffect. The following depots were formedinreview order, viz. -8th (the K1lnfs), Oith, 24th, 27th (Enniskillens) 29th, 32d, 35th, 43d (lig t Infantry), 52d(VLight Infantry), 53d. 60thx (Riflea), 61st, 64th, 70th, 74th(Highlanders, 78th Highlan.ders),8 tat, 8Ud, 84th, 86th, 87th (Royal Irish Muoeers), 90th (Light Infantry), and the St. Helena Regiment. The Provisional Battalion was formed into two battaliona, commanded by Conel HI Jervis and Liutenant.Colonel R. N. Phillips. Onthe left of the dep8ts of the line the Royal MIarine Light Infantry, consistxng of lOcompanie. and nearly 1,000strong, under the command of Colonel E. Rea, took up 1 their position. The Royal Engineers, commanded by Major C. A. Robertson, and the Royal Engineor Train Corps, under the command of Captain H. T. Siborne, formin? together 11 divisions, occupied tho extreme rig ht of the column, oeh battalion havng its band at therear. The line formed by the troops extended across the lines, andws fully a mile in length. Shortly after 11 o'clockthe Duke of Cambridge and suite, attended by Colonel Eden, Colonel 1. Sandham, Colouel B. A. Parker, Maior G. B. Rodney, Major C. Gordon, and a brilhant staff, arrived on the lines, and were received with a general saute, the troops presenting arms and the bands playing the national anthem. His Royal Highness and staff then proceeded to inspect the line; after which he took up his position at the salating flag, for the purpose of vwtnessing the manonuvres of the day. The troops were then formed into quarter distance columns after which they marched past in open order and in quick time, the horses and waggons of the Field Equipment Corps first trotting past, followed by the Rota1 Engineers, the troops of the Provisional Battalon, and, lastly, the Royal Marine Light Infantry. The battalions then -halted, after which they changed front and marched past left in front. On the conclusion of those movements the troops were formed into two brigades, the right line facing the river, and the left Fort Amherst, the Royal Marines being thrown.out for the purpose of skirmishing in front of the' line. The wholo of the troops then advanced in line, after which tbey retired from the right of the companies,- both of whchmanceuvres were performed in a satisfactory manner. After a variety of other movements each battalion was formed into square, when the officers advanced to the front and saluted. His Royal Highness then addressed the troops in a loud voice, expressing the satisfaction he felt ' at the result of his inspection. The dep ts of the Brovisional Battalion had made great progress during the, past year, and the manner in which they had icquitted themselves that day was extremely creditable to Colonel R. Jervis and the other offecers. He could not, however, help obxserving that the mounted field officers did not take- care togie the word of command to the troops closeto the line, and that crumstance prevented the men hearing it. The Royal Engineers were in excelent order, and had gone through the movementsin a most satisfactory manner. His Royal Highness then turned to the Royal Marines, and informed the offlcers and men that he was much pleased with their appearance that day, their marching past being very good indeed, the deployments made with coolness and precision, the skirin isher throw out with rapidity, san the skirmishing such that it could not have been better. The Royal Engineers and Royal Marines were then marched off the ground, and the Duke inspected tae dr hts of the Provisional Battalion. iEs Royal Highness left the garrson ehortly after 3 o'clock for Msidstone and Canterbury, the guns from the battery firing a Royal salute as he crossed the trenches.
THE INDIAN MAILS OXONC MORE. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-We had just been congratulating ourselves on the celerity the India mails had attained, so as to give us our arrivals from tha East in England on the day the departure from it took place, comforting ourselves in the hope that we had only to maLke tho day of despatch the same from both ends of the line to shorten return of post by a fortnight, when we are stunued bythe delay of 10 days, looked on vwth so much indifferenea as not to require so much as an expla. nation. It is now nearly a fortnight since lic Times tele graph from Trieste gave us the heads of intelligence from Bombay to the 16th of ApriL ItwAs bnt yesterday that The Times with all its energies was able to give its Indian correspondenoe entire. Meanwhile The 2mres, throngh its ownv special channeLt, has been giving us, ever since the Trieste message arrived, all that it concerned us to k-now from every quater of the Esst save India. Printing.house-square has been procuring, through the instrmoentality of its own resources, what St. Martin's-le-Grand, with the resouroes of the nation at command, could not supply. We honour tbe energy that enables private enterprise to accomplish for itself what our rulers fail to achieve for the nation, and now supplicate your assistancu to diminish at all events the interval which exists between us. The English mails at present are, on their arrival at Marseilles, detained at the post-office until the letters for the vaiousgreat towns in Pranoearesortedand despatched, an operation said to occupy from 10 to 12 hour For the entire 20 years of our postal intercourse with France the Marseilles authorities seem most successfully to have devoted themselves to the retardation of the arrangements it was their duty to have advanced. We have no oceasion to quarrel with our neighbours, bat if we cannot get on smoothly with them we can take the other road. The sea distance from Alexandria to Trieste is a third less than that to Marseilles. If the land route be a little longer, we can urge locomotives along at nearly the time and the speed steamers can be impelled. The Germans have long expressed their willingness to give us express trains through, as often as we desired, on the most liberal possible terms. I am not advocating any particular route, but surely we might change with advantage the present system of pushing on 1,000 or 2,000 miles as rapidly as possibleo and then standing stilL We have in the East one warjust beginning and another just being brought to an end, in the affairs of ,which, far away as they are, we ought to affect an interest. We have matters more importaut than war that will eompel our attention. The late reports from America threaten a cotton famine. India is the only country we have to look to to avert a general insurection in Lancashire, with that frightful crime, con. flagration, which arises when men, maddened by want, turn in their desperation to de3troy everything withm their reach. We have more than even this to apprehend. Within the past 10 months-from August 20 to May 4-we have sent 12 millions sterling worth of silver to India. 33ombay alone has required of this four millions, or a sum equl3 to the entire revenue of the presidency. The drain is increasing monthly, will continue to increase so long as we increase our demands on India and leave its inhabitants in a state of nakedness and barbarism-content to do without clothes, but eager for the gaudy ornamoeni of gold and sUver that delight the eye of the savee. A monetary crisis throughout Europe muA be the result. We already pay the Oriental and Peninsular Steutn 9avi. gation Coszpny N10,001. a-year for carrying our nmail. With a ocatribution so munHicent made by the r.%toa, de. mends ot speed so imperious, the Postmaster-.,eneral and Lords of the Admiralty nmight srely be Pr;suaded by the errgy said example of The Times to ax what coudf be lone.

TO THE EDITOR OF THgE. TIM_E& Sir,-I sbaU be much obliged by your contradicting a report 'which appeared in your columns a day or two since of the death of my father, Admir&l Gosselin. He is, I am lPY to say, fix good health, though he is in hia 93d year. owv rne, refore5 to observe that it is not yet too late for Her Majeat's Mniem to do him tardy justiee by giving him tbi appointment] of Admiral of the Fleet. Thereis, Sir, but one opinion throughout the professio--but one opinion at the United Service Club-and it is that Admiral Gosael's claim to this appointment is nndeanible. The Eenior Admiral of the Navy has from time immemorial invariably had the appointment, and his nothavinghoisted his 1lag has never been considered a disqualificxtion. Take the late Admiral Freeman as an instance. Morerver, Admirl Gosselin saw a great deal of service as Post Captain and in aui his ealier commissions, and has received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his services. He bas been in the navy 78 years, and I hope the claims ofEs old an officer may yet be recognized. I am. Sir. your obedient servant AL . A ADLEY GOSSELsL. Warn Piory, May 19.
THE SAL.E OF POISONS.-A Bill has been brought into the House of Lord& by the Lord President of the Councl "to restrict and regulate the sale olpoisons." The preamble recites that the existing restrictions on the sale-of asenic have been found to be insufficient, and that the unmtricted sale of other poisons facilitates the commission of crime and occasions freqnent fatal accidentsg Clause 3 attempts the difficult task of defining -what "poison.J' really is. The word is constrned to include certain drus simple or compounded, mentioned in the schedule A of the Act. Theseconsist of x large number of pharmacopeixel and other preparations, mnost of which are in common use as articles of mediine.

LODOiY, THUBSDAY, MAY 21, 1857. In the House of Commons yesterday, on the rotion of Mr. DUNLoP, to which the LoRD-ADVOcaTE assented, the Registration of Long Leases (Scotland) Bill was read a second time. Mr. ADDERLEY moved the order for going into committee upon the Industrial Schools BiL Sir G. GBBY said this was a measure of great imzrtAnce. Its object was moat benevolent, but the Provisions required much consideration, and he was not prepared then to go into committee. He recom. mended Mr. ADDERI,Ey to accede to the motion of which Lord GODERIOH had given notice, to defer the committee for three weeks. Mr. MIrLES concurred with Sir G. GREY. Mr. GREGORY, approving much of what was con. tained in the Bill, required further safeguards against tampering with the religion of the children. Lord GODnRICn moved to defer the committee for three weeks. The machinery of the Bill, he observed, required the utmost consideration. Among other things, it repealed the law of settlement quwoad vagrant children. This was a new principle which ought not to be dealt with hastily. Mr. ADDERLEY wished to have the main points discussed in committee and the Bill reprinted with the amendments. Mr. BArNES was friendly to the principle of the Bill, but wished to seo a well considered, not a crude, measure. Various questions of importance were involved in the Bill, and boards of guardiau3 should have an opportunity of considering them and of knowing the ultimate views of the framer, and ddlay would afford a better chance of a good measure. Mr. ROEBUCK thought it was the duty of the Government to say whether they would or would not adopt the Bill, and in the latter case to make it their own. After some further debate, the amendment was withdrawn, and the Bill was committed proform&, to be reprinted with the amendments. The House then went into committee upon the Judgments Execution, &c., BiD, and was occupied in the discuesion of its details during the remainder of the sitting, the CEAiRmAN being ordered to report progreMs. The other orders having been disposed of, the House adjourned at a few minutes before 6 o'clock.
It may indeed be said that charity never fafleth. Under all discouragements and diffliculties, at the cost of great and recurring, and seemingly never-ending sacrifice, the spirit of humanity pursues its task. In our own country this fountain of philanthropy is continually gushing up fresh and vigorous, as if to water every waste place of the earth with its streams. In spite of much that is eccentric and narrow-minded, no rightly-judging man can withhold his respect from such institutions as are about this time celebrating their yearly meetings. What they represent we all of us know. Their weak points are such as strike every one, and they have borne the ridicule of aU the wits for the last fifty years. Dinners, begging letterm, committees, secretaries, and long meetings, enlivened by a kind of pious jocosity, are easily placed in a ridiculous light; but the good impulses of which these are the perhaps illjudged expression are such as no man can fail to reverence. Througbout this land there are thousands who, while struggling themselves for their daily bread, and forced to pinch and pare to bring the year's expenditure within the year's income, stil manage to spare a trifle, and even more than a trifle, to raise the fallen, to help the afflicted, to instruct the ignorant in the remotest parts of the earth, and yet, through the difficulty of the object, or the misdirection of means, we find year after year pass away without much real progress. The Society's report wil mention a few cases of conversion, which the orators of the day wir declare to be extremely cheering. The ready enthusiasm of the meeting will answer the new appeal, more money will be subscribed, more missionaries sent out, and bhe next year the same tale will be told of impotent exertions and deferred hopes. Now, the nation in its corporate capacity has been for the last fifty years acting with all the patience and all the irrational trustfulness of an Exeter-hall Association. Only a few men can remember the time when the fabric of Liverpoors greatness -was said to be " cemented by the blood " of the slave," and every week saw fast-sailing brigs clear out for the Gold Coast with a large assortment of beads and red flannel, plenty of rum, and a fuU store of handcuffs. Since those days we have been endeavouring by every means to suppress the African Slave Trade. It has been our mission. To attain this desired end of saving the Negro from his oppressor we have made ourselves the Densors, and almost the enemies, of aU maritime nations. We took especial pride in introducing the subject into the Treaty of Vienna, and aince that time we have concluded treaties wish almost every State, great or small, from France, and the United Sta'es, and Brazil, to the petty chiefs who grease themselves with cocoanut oil on the Gulf of Guinea. And what is the result ? If we are to believe the general evidence of the world, the Slave Trade goes on as vigorously as ever. The demand for sugar, coffee, and other tropical products has increased wonderfully of late years. AU Europe and aU America are asking for the articles which Brazil, Cuba, and Porto Rico produce. To supply our demands they must have more Negroes, and Africa lies before them, ready to sell as many as they want. Can we wonder at the result? Spain and Brazil have made treaties with us, partly owing to our importunities, partly through the necessity of appearing well with the world, partly, we have no doubt, from the sincere wish of the Governments to put down a great iniquity. But the gain of the trade is greater than the danger. The worst is to lose the vessel, which is of comparatively little value, while if the trip be successful the profits are enormous. Take the account of the capture of a slaver by the Arab on the coast of Cuba. Trhe vessel was only of 150 tons; the slave deck was exactly two feet six inches in height, so that the unfortunate creatures could barely sit upright. Five hundred negroes, according to the confession, or rather the boast, of the captian, were taken on board. Of these 138 perished in 53 days; 40 died in one day. Such is the state of things on board of a slaver at the present time, aud we need not explain that the horrors which await the Negro are much more terrible than in the days of the legalized Slave Trade, when the "middle passage," the theme of so much indignant eloquence, was not rendered more insufferable by the necessity of carrying large numbers in small craft built especially for speed, and unprovided with proper arrangements for cleanliness and health. We are told that of those who survived in this particular cargo, nearly all were in the last stage of emaciation and disease, " their thighs about the "circumference of a large walkingstick, mere skin "C and bone, eaten up with scurvyandthe itch." Now, what is the inducement for a trader to risk the loss of ship and cargo, not to speak of good name, and to become the perpetrator and spectator of such atrocities? The answer is simple enough :-" The "c aptain states that he has run nine successful "cargoes, and been captured six times, and that "he has lost 6,0001. by this trip, but that he "does not mind it, as, if he had succeeded in "landing the cargo, he would have received "37,0001. for the adventure." This is the end of all our exertions. For this it is that we have quarrelled with other nations, or coaxed them, compromising our position or making our names odious. For this a squadron is kept on the coast of Africa at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds yearly, and a family or two in almost every one's acquaintance has had its victim to fever or sunstroke. For this we keep up settlements over 40 degrees of latitude, sending out governors and bishops to perish amid the malaria of i festering marshes. For this we have soeieties and subscriptions at home, and scrmons about the grain of mustardseed, and speeches in Parliament about Britain's cegis thrown over the slave. Brazil andSpain care as little for ourprinciples as the naked barbarians who sell their prisoners or subjects to the skippers. The question then is, what shall we do ? To despatch cruisers to the African coast to chase slavers has been avowedly a failure. To remonstrate with foreign Governments has been equally ineffectual. We have the choice of two alternatives either to leave the trade to itself, in which case it would be carried on with at least a mitigation of barbarity, since the health of the cargo would be to the advantage of the trader, or to take sunmary measures to prereunt the landing of Negroes on any point of the alave-importing coast. To blockade thoroughly Cuba and Brazil is certainly a difficult enterprise, but stiU it might be effected by the perseverance of diplomacy or the authority of superior force. There would at least be something of honesty and consistency in such a course, however great might be the risk and the hostility which the act might awaken. But the present position of moderate and hesitating imbecility can effect nothing, and the sooner we relinquish a policy which supports a preventive squadron on the African coast, without hindering heavily-laden slavers from appearing in the harbours of Cuba, the better it will be for our character as a sincere and deterrmined people.
Ten years of contest and argument, of success and failure, of abortive Bills and remodelled projects, have so complicated the question of Parliamentary Oaths that it may be desirable to simplify the subject by a plain exposition, preparatory to its present, and we trust final, consideration by the House. It is not a little remarkable that, as regards any peculiar obligations which may be conceived to be incumbent upon members of Parliament, no security for the diacharge of them i3, or ever has been, provided by any Oath whatever. The Oaths required for a seat in the House are required on many other occasions also; they are common to functionaries, graduates, and practitioners of various descriptions, and only embrace the representatives of the people in the course of a comprehensive sweep. In number they are three, in character and ultimate purport entirely similar, being all designed to maintain and secure the rights of the CRowN as settled in a certain Ine of succession. The most direct Oath is that of Allegiance, which conveys a solemn undertaking on behalf of the swearer to pay and bear the fidelity and allegiance naturally due from a subject to his Sovereign. This allegiance, however, and this undivided homage were conceived, and not without reason, to have been specialy menaced from two particular quarters,-first, from the assumptions of the POPE, and afterwards from the pretensions of rival claimants to the throne. The Reformation of religion detached this island Erom that connexion with the See of Rome which had formerly prevailed; the PoPE fulminated his anathemas accordingly, and the adherents of the POPE within the realm were naturally supposed to favour his demands and recognize the attributes which he assumed. Against theso opinions theOath of Supremacy was levelled, an oath in which the entire and indubitable supremacy of the govereign of this kingdom was asserted, to the lestruction of all other pretensions whatsoever; Rnd especially was it affirmed, in the strongest language possible, that the doctrine by which the PoPmS claimed to exercise power over Kings and Princes in their own dominions was uttarly abominable. The Revolution of the succeeding ,entury, by transferring the crown from the houme f STURT, left the members of this family in the position of active pretenders to the throne, and it was therefore deemed advisable that security should be taken in all cases of sufficient importance against bhe possible admission or promotion of these claims. lhis resolution produced the Oath of Abjuration, in which the pretensions of the STruARTs and their aescendants were formally repudiated and abjured, and due allegiance to the Sovereigns of rightful succession explicitly professed. As the point, too, was reaoly one of urgency,-for it was deb&ted more than once on the battlefield, and was not settled for many a year,-peculiar pains were taklen so to fortify and hedge about this declaration that no furtive escape from its operation might be practicable. The swearer was compelled to renounce all idea of mental reservation, equivocation, or evasion, and to affirm that he took the Oath in its plain natural sense and oa the trze faith of a C7ristian. Here, then, were the three Oaths. They do not, as will have been seen, contain any undertaking, pledge, or promise, especiaUy or exclusively pertaining to the obligations or functions of a Member of the Legislature. They were tendered to all persons and in all cases where any office, position, or quality assumed by the individual could be considered as giving him influence in the country, and providing the Government with an opportunity of employing the test; and the simple object was to protect the allegiance due to the Sovereign of the realm from any prejudice accruing by the pretensions of the POPE on the one side or the STUARTS on the other. No direct profession of Christianity was exacted, but inasmuch as one of the Oaths was made to depend " on the true faith of a Christian," and these words were held to be of its essence, none but a Christian could duly take it, and therefore non-Christians, and notably Jews, could not sit in the House. Be it observed, however, that the bearing of these words did not affect Parliamentary Oaths only. They would have disabled a Jew just as completely in the case of any other office or place where the Oath of Abjuration was tendered in that form. After these remarks little difficulty, we trust wil be experienced in comprehending the scope aad character of Lord PAiamsToz's present proposition. Of the Oaths in question one has become in its leading points so utterly superfluous as actually to involve profanation in the sanction invoked. The " descendants of the person who "pretended to be Prince of WA.LXs during the "lifetime of the late King JEAs IL" have simply no existence. We are under no necessity of speculating on the probable character of public opinion respecting such persons, or the expediency of proscribing them; it is enough to say that they are not to be found, and the proposal of the PBnaiER to abolish the allusion made to them is not likely to encounter any objection. Lord PALasRSTON further proposes to eliminate the special clauses ia which the terrors and suspicions of less happy times were expressed, and to abolish accordingly the clause of abhorrence and detestation in the Oath of Supremacy, and that of nonequiivocation or evasion in the Oath of Abjuration, the positive undertaking of allegiance to tha reigning family being still retained, and the three Oaths being then consolidated into one. A person taking the new Oath will no longer be required to " detest arxd abhor" in set terms "the damnable doctrine that Princes excom"municate by the POPE may be deposed or "imurdered;" but he will still have to declare, in most explicit and comprehensive language, that no foreign Prince or Potentate has, or ought to have, any jurisdiction, power, or authority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within this realm. He will still be required to renounce obedience to any pretenders to the crown, and to swear true allegiance to the Sovereign, and fidelity to the Protestant succession; but he will not be caUled upon to abjure the progeny of JAwS II. by name, nor will he be compelled to follow up his Oath by any elaborate profession that he is not secretly for- swearing himself. Finally, this abolition of ths extraordinary precautions attached to the Oath of Abjuration will remove those half-dozen words which constitute the only civil disability now remaining, and, as the Oath embodying all the vital principle of the old Oaths is not ordered to be sworn " on the true faith of a Christian," it may be taken in its full force ancd integrity by a Jew. Such is the purport of the PRErxn!s proposition. In its general character, in its removal of confessedly obsolete matter, and in the simplification which it effects, it would probably create very little dissent. Perhaps some persons may forego with reluctance tho pleasure of execrating a Popish doctrine with the downright heartiness of our ancestors, but the real point of contention will, of course, be found in the omission of the words by which non-Christians are at present excluded from the legislature. This point, of course, will be argued, if it admits of argument any further, on its own merits, nor can we affect to doubt of the result, considering how repeatedly such result has been declared. The remodelled Oath wiU accomplish all the substantial purposes contemplated in the old Oaths. The supremacy of the Sovereign will be expressly affirmed, true allegiance will be solemnly promised, and all false allegiance will be renounced; but an extinct line of pretenders wiU no longer be particularized, and a vain redundancy of asseverations will be curtailed. That in the phrases thus retrenched there should be one which has accidentaly operated to the exclusion of a loyal, wealthy, and intelligent class of HER MAnTss subjects from Parliament, is a circumstance suggestive, in our opinion, of additional satisfaction at the change.
On Tuesday night there was a very animated 'discussion in the House of Commons upon a subject which is of greater interest upon the other side of St. George's Channel than on our own. How many persons in England have ever been at the pains of studying the question of "M Binisters' " Money 7" It is, however, a matter of some interest, though far from being of that importance -which was ascribed to it by the Opposition speakers in the House of Commons the other night. The case is this :-In the reign of CHamBs IL a tax, which at present produces about 12,000Z. a-year, was laid upon certain corporate towns in Ireland, eight in number, which did not possess any provision for the maintenance of the ministers of the Established Church. A simple glance at the names of these eight towns will be sufficient to show that they were for the most part situated in the ultra-Roman Catholic districts of Ireland. They run thus :-Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Drogheda, and Kinsale. The tax was abolished by JAS II. in one of the mock Parliaments held by his authority in Ireland, but after his abdication. No attention, however, was given to this illegal proceeding, nor was the payment challenged in any Parliamentary manner until quite a recent period. We omit all mention of tentative discussions and defeated attempts, and pass at once to tne first legislative enactment which has affected the provisions of the Act of CARiES If. This was passed in the year 1854, during Lord ABERDERNS Government, Sir Jonw YovxG having charge of the measure. By the Act of 1854 the Irish clergy were enabled to receive from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners the amount of the Ministers' Money due to them respectively, less 25 per cent. It was considered that 75 per cent. of the estimated value regularly paid would be a good compensation-indeed, it was far more than a compensation-for the larger nominal sum to which they were entitled by the statute of CHARLES, but of the greater portion of which they could never obtain payment at all. There was also a provision that all houses in the eight towns of less than 101. value should be exempted from the rate. Finally, the Corporations were to levy the tax, and to be answerable for its due payment to the Ecclesiastical Commiwsioners, in order to recompense them for the annual payments which they were by this Act required to make to the clergy. Now, a good deal of the discussion turns upon the source from which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners derive their revenues, as well as their present amount, and at the risk of being tedious to our better informed readers we will venture in a few words to remind these among them who have not paid so strict an attention to the course of political events of what those revenues really are. In the year 1833 Lord D3BBY, then Mr. STAyLEY, by a most salutary measure, abolished the coUection of Church-ess in Ireland. The amount of this was about 70,0001. per annum, and to this extent the Irish Church was impoverished. To meet this difficulty 10 sees were suppressed, and a tax was thrown upon all livings -we are, of course, speaking of Ireland-above the value of 3001. a-year. From these sources a fund was derived which was placed in the hands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. These Commissioners, as Church-cess was abolished, were to rebuild churches and chapels, to maintain Divine service, and to pay clerks and sextons. If a surplus remained they were to build churches whereverone-fifthof thecost was derived from voluntary contributions; to build and purchase glebehouses; and, finally, to augment poor livings umder the annual value of 2001. The income of the Commission, as stated on Tuesday night by Lord JoHr RusELL in the House of Commons, has increased from 68,0001. in 1848 to 93,0001. in 1856, giving, therefore, an increase of 25,0001., which, as we should conceive from the nature of the property from which it is derived, is not likely to be of a transitory nature. The proposition now is to abolish Ministers' Money altogether, but to continue the payments from the fund at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical Commiasioners as heretofore. AlR statesmen, as far as we are aware, who have been at all intimately connected with Irish matters agree in their recommendation of such a course. The simple result of trying to screw the money by legal process out of the Corporations bas been an enormous amount of litigation and expenditure. The Irish Attorney-General (Mr. FITZGERAD) stated the other night in the House that, from the first, the Corporations-that of Dublin excepted-had expressed their determination not to become collectors of the tax. In consequence of their refusal seven suits had been commenced against them in the Irish Exchequer, and in one judgment had been obtained for the CRowNr, but proceedings had already been taken in the House of Lords with the view of obtaining a reversal of that judgment. This is not a pleasant state of things, for Mr. FiTzGzRALsDS view appears to be; that even a favourable decision in the Lords will scarcely improve the position of the Irish Executive with reference to the hostile Corporations. Now, the abolition of this tax does not involve any question of principle. Parliament, upon certain grounds Iof State policy, imposed a particular rate upon (ight Irish towns about a couple of centuries ago. For certain other reasons of State policy Parliament now sees fit to repeal that rate, taking care, however, to provide most handsomely in the way of compensation for those persons whose rights under the statute of CEARLES might be supposed to be affected by the repeal. What ground for complaint is there here? With whom is faith broken? With the ministers? No. They themselves are the frst to commend the settlement under the Act of 1854, which, as far as they are concerned, is no doubt a great boon. With the Irish Church? As little; for the best arrangement possible is made in the interest of the Church. How if the Government were to refuse all interference in the matter, to repeal the BiU of 1854, and to leave the Irish clergy to their remedy under the old Act of CHA':'? The clergy would find themselves compelled either to give up altogether the contribution to their incomes, or to levy them, as thcy best could, by distress. What an expedient for increasing the popularity and efficiency of the Established Church in Ireland I It may be sad that the Government -would be compelled to support the clergy, and to obtain for them satisfaction of their lawful demands by the strong arm of the law. This, no doubt, is go. It is the duty of Government to enforce legal process, but the State has a perfect right to abrogate any law which may appear to produce trouble and confusion to a great portion of its subjects, without correlative advantage to any. When we remember what the condition of Ireland was before Mr. STAXU's Bill we are not at all tempted to revive a policy which led to such scenes of riot and bloodshed, even upon a smaller scale. T'he only other point which remains for consideration is this :-Granted that the levy of Ministers' Money ought to be abolished-upon what fund shall the charge be thrown Would it be right to call upon the general tapayers of the empire to meet the deficiency from the Consolidated Fund? Surely not. The Irish Church, like any other corporation or individual, must bear its own losses as well as enjoy its own gains. If the circumstances of the times are so altered that any one soue from which a prtion of its reve,kue was derived dries up, no doubt from a hundred others it is infinitely increased. The Irish Church has ample funds now in the hands of the Eclesiastical Commissioners for meeting so trifling a charge as this, and it should do so without a murmur. We leave it to the opinion of any man of common capacity who has watched the tendencies of public opinion to decide how any proposition for increasing the revenues of the Irish Church by a fresh grant of the public money would be received. Tnere is a moment at which the most finely constructedcard house must fall, and that is when it receives a fillip from a real substantial finger and thumb. Now, the logic of Messrs. NsAaEn and WHr"ssm is the card house npon this occasion, and "It can't be done" the fillip which destroys the delicate edifice in a moment. We really cannot either tax the empire or engage ourselves' in another series of Irish prosecutions and Iish riots.upon such a matter as this. We have had enough of bigotry and fanaticism upon Irish matters on both sides. It is now time for ultra-zealots, Orangemen, and Papists, and agitators of all kinds to give way. Men of moderate passions and of a las fervent temperament have at last earned a right to say to them all, "Gentlemen, "let common sense have a turn."

When the time cam'e for making up the balAnoe-sheet to submit to the shareholders, I desired 'the acoountant in tbe bank to make out the balance in strict accordance withl the books of the bank, and I handed him a printed form of the balanoes of tho London and WestminaterBankor LondonJoint-StockBauk -the two first in London-ae a prcoodent, that they were in the habit of sending the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank; and I do believe the balances were talken strictl froxm the bank books, even to the shilling and sixpenoce, 2.hd not one figure altered orchangedin any way in consequenoe of John Sadleir's letter of the 31st of December, orany other leter; and I firmly believed Joln Sadleir was perfectly solvent on the 1st of Febrnary, 1856. It was opea to any shareholder to oome or aend at any time to inspect the books, balnces, &c.; and I wonald have be en only too hippy to ive all the information in my power. Inow beg to state it is not my wish to may one word hurtful to the feelings or injurious to the interest of any person in thia unfortunate busness. No person regrets more than I do the loe to aU-' hare'aolders and creditois, and every other person-by the late John Sadleir- lint yonmnat be as well aware as oohers that he deceivesi me and robbed me fully as much as any other "Iaeu, Sir, your obedient servant, To this the Dublin journal properly repries " According to himself, James Saffleir i nincn Victim. to his crodnsty. He certainly did not carry ouLt John's atrocious suggestions in form; but yet, when the affairs of the Tipperary Bank were in total and hopeless Insovency, with asets ot amounting to a sixth prt of the money plundered from the creditors-the victims of the nefarious system carried out by John throngh the instm. mentality of Jrmes-he, as the managing director, roe duced and signed a report which represente the atirs of the bank as in a most flourishing condition In this report, which was 'coked' after the regeiptof John's instructions, a dividend of 6 per cent, with a bonus of 3 per ¢cnt, was declared, both ' free of inoome.tax' leaving a balance out of profits of 3,3031 14s. 4d. to be added to a pretended reserved fund, which, after that addition, would amount to 17,375 12s. 7d. And ifter the thorough exposure of aU this James Sadleir plays the in, nocent, and talks of his sympathy with shareholders and creditors I When the hour for punishment arrives there is no one so sorry for his offence as the criminal; but James Sadleir walks the fashionable promenades of Paris, appa. rently unconscious of the vile art he had performed as manager of a fraudulent bank. We are told that the Extradition Law does not reach his ase. If this be so, that law ought at once to be modified for the apprehension of such offenders aud the protection of the public. He now declares that he was not a rogue but a dupe, and that his brother deceived and robbed him 'fully as much as any other person.' He seeks to establish in effeet, that the most arrant fool in existenoe had been placed in the management of a bLnk long used for purpowes of fraud, by the most inveterate swindler that has figured in modern times. Supposing that John Sadeir did rob his brother, "as weU as everybody else v ith whom he had been dealing, we must still hold that brother criminally respconsible for becoming awilling instramsent in the carrying out of those stupendous frauds 'which haveegive,n anInfamous notoriety to the conduct of both ENCU3TBBED ESTATES COURT. There were but two insgnificant sales yesterday -one of ani estate in the county of Limerick, the other of house property in the city of Dablin. The sum realized for both was about 10,0001. The extensive estates of Mr. Vincent Scully, situate in the county of Tipperary will shortly be brought into the market. The rentals are in course of preparation, and in a few days or Ro all the particalars will be made public. TlE TEANT RiGHT BI. The Dublin Bvening Post calls attention to the fact that Ir. George Henry Mloore has again most strangely mismanaged the Tenant Bill, of which he has undertaken the conduct:- ' The hon. gentleman has deliberately given notice of the B ll for the 25th of May, being the day on which the Queen's birthday B celebrated, and consequently there will be no House. This is mere mockery. In 18% he fixed the second reading for the 22d of April, the day of the great naval reiewv, when, as he knew, there would be no Honse, and the measure was indefinitely postponed As the case nowv stands, the motion for leave to introdnce the Bill cannot be brought forwrard u ntil after Whiteuntide holid3ys, which will render the case quite hopefese this year." AGRICOLTUITEA rBOSPECTS. Last night there was a tolerably heavy fall of ramn, and, as the wind is constantly shifting, it is probable that there will soon be an end of the complaints of drought. The reports from the country are still most cheering, and were it not for the scarcity and high rateS of labour agriculturai prosperity wvould seem to have reached the rnndnsusm point.

Lard Stauley, M.P., was in the chair, and amlong those present were the Rev. Sir H. Foulis, Bart., the Hon. Captain Pakenham, Colonel Bol. dero, M.P., Mr. HL S. Thornton, Dr. G. H. Roe, Dr. R. Qu1in, Mr. John Bull, and the Rev. B. Marriott. The usual loyal and patriotic toasts having been given and duly honourea, the chairLuan gave the toast of the evsnlnu IProsnerity to the Brompton Hospital." In propos tVs toast the noble lord stated that of 45,000 deaths which occurred yearly in the metropolitan districts, 5,60 were cauised by consumption; thus, excluding in. fantine mortWlity, about one-fifth of the deaths arcOe from this disease. Since the establishment of this hospital it had relieved 5,5S6 in-patients and 36,030 onut atients; its income had in one vear amounted to 19,0001., but had averaged between 7,000i. and 8,000o If the hos. pital were well-managed it was certainly deserving of the support of the publici and that it was well-managed these and other facts statedin the report would undoubtedly prove. The toast was responded to by Mr. S. C. Hall. Daring the evening subscriptions were announced amounting to upwrards of l,OOlZ. of which the noble chairman gave 2) juinens, and the Earl oE Derby 30 guineas.

lB. DISRAEIZIN.NOPTH BUCKrNGHAM- SHIRE. (FROM our. OWN BEBPORTSR.) The two Concervative members for the county of Beues Vcsterday dined!, according to ancient custom, at a farmors' 'ordinary, with a body of their constituents, at the Anchor Hotel, Newport Paguell The company comprised nearly ZL.i5 agriculterists and other infl uential gentlemen connected wnith the northern part of the county. It w;nI bo seen from the subjoined report of the proceed. lags that Mr. Disraeli availed himself of the opportunity .afforded by tho occasion to enter into a lengthened exposition ,of his views on the present aspect of publo 3afairs. The -chair was occupied by Mr. E. Greaves. The usual loyal and patriotio toasts having been given, the health of the two Conservative members were duly pro. .posed and enthusiastically received. Air. DU PRB, in virtue of his position as senior member, *was the first to respond, and addressed the company in %rief but appropriate terms. Yxr. DiSRAZLI was received with loud cheera. He said,1ir. Chairmnan and geatlemen,-I should have been quite eatisfied to leave the aknovwledgment of our senEe of your lsindness to us to-day to my colleague, Mr. DaPre- between whom and myself, since we have both been in the service of the county, there has always existed entire sympathy, and from whom, 'whenever the affairs of Buckinghamshire have t--en concerned, I have elways received cordial co-operation and assistance-had I not been afraid that it wouldappear like affectation On my part were I to suppose that on this occasion you woald expect me to remain altogether silent. It is some time now since I had the honour of meeting you at Newport Pazuell and in this room, and the interval that has elapsed has been eventful even in this country, where events :mast nece3sarily succzed each other rapidly. Last night, or I -may say this morming, for it was nearly 2 o'clook when the House of Commons was breaking up, a very great personage 'Invited me to call upon him to confer with him on a subject -of deep moment, and I told him that it was not in my .pCer to wait upon him as I oould have wished, because I Ihaa to meet my constituents, with whom I was to have the honour of dining at a farmers' ordinary at Newport Pagnell; -upon which that great personage observed, "Good God! what can yoa say to them '' (Laughter.) Gentlemen, -his is the solution of the inquiry of that eminent personage. I have kept my engagement to meet a body of my consti'tuents, and I am now about to do that which, iu the opinion of one of the most experienced ju dges of such matters, is regarded as, probably, the most difficult task that could fall to the lot of any mna. Now, that great personage, although he has received all that the favour of the Sovereign -and the confidence of the people could bestow upon him in his distinguished career, and although he has also been a -county member, never had the honour of representing the County of Backs. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) That I {believe is the only honour he has never achieved. If he had ever been a member for this county he would have known that it is not difficult at any time to address a body --of men who from their habits, and the traditions they have .inherited from their forefathers, have always taken an Interest in political questions and in the govornment of the country. (EIear, hear.) Therefore, although I address you -at a moment when public excitement is not very rife, still, as is my custom-as is always the custom of gour members-I wish to speak to you with -candour and witho ut reserve on subjects of mational interest and importance; and I know that I shall receive from you that sympathy and attention which may ibe expected from a body of gentlemen who do not, on *Docasions like the present, lo ok to the mere claptraps of -tavern rhetoric, but require from their representative a 52rank and manly doclaration of his opinions on the great fbopics which interest them. (Hear, hoar.) When we last snotin this room some five years ago you were suffering Yrom that unrostricted competition to which the industry ;in which you are all engaged was, by a great and unex-peoted commercial revolation, suajected; and it was then a great questioa whether y ou would be able successfulxy to 3pass through that ordeal. Muoh confidence, in which I shared, was felt at that time in the energy and skiUl of the British farmer; and, speaking now in the presence of a B3ritish-of a Buekinghamshi re farmer-who has reduced 'the steam-plough to saccessful practice (hear, hear), I do not -think I was wrong in the expectations I then entertained Prom tho high qualities of our cultivators of the soiL But -it not to revive the controversy between unrestricted competition and protected industry that I have adverted to this subject.While that great and everfierce controversywasgoing on, a vast revolution was taking place from natural causes, and. perhaps, by Providential interposition which, in fact, baffied all the predictions and all the calculations hazarded on both sides of the question. What effect the gold dis. coveries of California and Austmlia have had on the fortunes - of England and of the world is a subject which eugages and perplexes the minds of the most eninent men in this country. Yet the question is one which we must not neglect to consider. I have no doubt myself that directly, 1by stimulating the consuming power of the world and producing new markets, and more powerfully, though indirectly, by cau4ing and creating the great works now being prosecuted in every part of the globe, these discoveries led to those higb prices which havo for some years prevailed in all articles, and have tended to counteract the effect of the legislative changes which we feared. I don't mean to say that the railroads of England, for example, are owing to the discovery of the precious metals in California and Australia; but the railways of France, Spain, Austria, and particalarly of India, are solely due to that cause. It may be said, if we attribute such beneficial consequences to the unexpecte(d iucrease of the capital of the world, that it is difficult to reconcile such results with the high rate of interest oii capital whIch now prevails. Of course, on such . subject all opinions must be given with due humility, but it is my own belief that these apparent inconsistencies may be reconciled. I have no doubt, and never had any .dsu t, that time tendency and ultimate result of the gold discoveries will be to diuir,ish the rate of interest on money. At the sanme tine we cannot conceal from ourselves that the enterprise f the human race has outrun the increase of caprit1 which hAs taken place; and, although by that enter.prse a great stimulus has been imparted to the consuming power of the country, occasioning the present beneficial =nficence on prices, stil a high rate of interest for capital has simultaneously occurred. I have no doubt, however, tiat as events proceed, we shaU find a natural result -ensue, and that while you experience this advantage from the prices of all the artioles which you produce and consume, ;ou wil also combine with them that mttch reduced rate of interest on capital which I think is the inevitable consequence of those gold discoveries, which are probably destined to produce a greater effect on the history of this country ond of the world than anything that has happened since the discovery of America. (Hear, hear.) I have referred to these p ,ints because they have a very material connexion with the position in which you were placed when I last had the honour m,f addressing you. Nor can I conceal it from mysalf-although, no doubt, there may be some great strain on the country in the interval -although, no doubt, titere is reqinired in private enterprise great prudence, and ln the public expenditure great economy-that the position -of the natimu in consequence of the recent discoveries of the precious inetilshasbecomeone of asounl and healthy description. I cana ,t doubt that the ultimate effect of aU this must beto increase the prosperity of thiscountry; nor do I believe that either in ancient or modern history there ever was a nation more happily placed than England is at present, or that had a fulture to which it might look forwvard with so much satisfaction. (Hear, hear.) Well, if that be a true -and fair vie v of our situation, it is certainly very remark. able that this is the moment in xvhich we hear so much of approaching political changes, and that it should be at a time vhen the grnat body of the people are satisfied, contented, 4a, a prosperous, that we should hear of great impending innovations in our political institutions. (Hear, hear.) It becomes us at the present moment wel to consider the position that we now occupy, and what may be the course which -it vill be our duty to take should these changes be -proposed. (lear, hear.) I shall take the liberty, with the utmost brevity of which the natare of the case admits, to state my opinions on -this subject. In fact it would be a mockery for one who holds the important post of your representative to meet you here to-day aud not revert to what seems to be the consequence of the last dissolution of Parliament-namely, that in due time, and when our rulers think fit, we shall ibe caUed upon to consider great changes in the political con. stitution of the country. With regard to Parliamentary Reform I would p resum to say this-that I have no preju. ~dices in favour of the existing system, whbich was brou"ht -into operation in 1832. I beh7eve when that great chabge took placeo its conception was not altogether exempt from -'the spirit of faction. (HIear, hear.) I have always thought, and always expressed my belief, that when the reform of cP'arliament wats brought forward in 1832 it was not framed 'ith a just regard to the interests of thie connected with the .property arid the ultivation of the soil. I think ahso,. altttough this is a very minor point, that in arrangng the 'boundaries of boroughs and many other matters there was .al that jobbing, contrivance, and mianceuvre which are, probably, inevitable when such a measure is prepared by a politicai party so circumstanced at the moment of effecting -the change as to be irresponsible. But, though I haveheld that -opinion, I have also thought that political change, unless -ealled for by a politic&l necessity, is, in a country like Ealand, a groat social evil. (Hear, hear.) And I have looked -nlways-not, I believe, without reason-to the remedial agency which would be exercised on some of the arrange'meats that might have been very factiously brought about, 'by the good sense and common feeling of Englishmennfluences which would, in the long run, tend to remove some of the evils and alleviate some of the injrstice which are now prettygeneraUy acknowledged to markthe zettlemeut of 1832. But, although I believe there is no feeljag whatever in the country in favour of wbat is commonily -alled Parliamentary reform; though I think I may say lhat the Parliamentary reformers in the present day are -only to be found in Parliament; yet, when you look to the joaition of the question, and find that the Prime Minister nas acknowledged-no matter what may have been the -cause of his decision-that it is his intention next year to introduce a measuro of Parliamentary reform, leaving it probably to public opinion in the interval to give a tone as to what the character of that measure may be, I think we :should be totally negligent of our duty, quite unworthy of the privileges of Englishmen, ii we paswed stich an occasion in eilence, and did not attempt, by calm consideration and by investigating the merits of the case, to arrive at some con-clusions that may guide our conduct when we are called upon to act. (Cheers.) Now, although for the reasons I have assi4ned I am unwilling that the present system should be disturbed, althog llI oiia caltgeuthe graet Of all cojial evils in its consequences, nltoughe Iiinay not be PrePared-and yet it has been.an. n some public journals of the greatest eminence that I am-with a Reform Bill of my own (laughter)I am not prepared, on the other hand, to say that if the Binister on hi3 own responsibility bring forward a measure of that character, I will not give to it a candid and sincere consideration on its nmerits. (Hear, hear.) Thore is great discussion at the present day as to what is the proper elemeat of representation. Some tell you that population is the element of a representative system; others tell you property is the proper element; a third party tells you that property and population should be taken together; and a fourth tells you that population and property always go together, and cannot be separated. But I think there is one elem ent in a representative Government which is still more important than even population or property. I mean prescriplion. (Hear, hear.) AnoldEuropean country, and especially England, obeys the authority to which it is sccustomed. But no country of the antiquity of our own, no country where so artificial a system of society and of credit exists as in this, ever can sustain perpetual changes of Government, and wiU always have a bias for obeyig the authority 'which is traditionary. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, supposing the Minister next year brings forward a scheme of Parliamentary reform, I shall, though adverse as a general ruleto political change, give to his propositon a candid consideration- I shall ask myself whether the proposi. tion 'which he makes is one that is calculated to concede that justice which I think has been hitherto denied to your claims, but which I would not have disturbed society by demanding, and yet which, if by the act of the Government themselves the countrv is called upon to investigate the question, I think it the duty of the classes connected with the land clearly and earnestly to place before the Legislature. Lot me illustrate my meaning by an instance. The popular idea of Parliamentary Reform may be fairly stated in this manner. A gentleman who is a Parliamentary Reforser takes a small borough-for example, Buckingham or Wycombe-and he says, " Here are two boroughs with a constituency of 300 voters each, and here is the city of MAnchester, ia the county of Lancaster, with a population of 300,000 inhabitants, but with only two members, or the same number, in fact, as the little borough of Backingham. What injustice ! What anamolies ! It is absolutely necessary that we should disfranchise Backingham or Wycombe, and transfer its two members to Manchester." And it is astonishing how plausible this proposal sounds, and how easily it is credited even by those whose interests are not involved in its adoption. Bat, gentlemen, if you come to anomalies, I should iLke to know whether there aro none in our representation infinitely more striking than this very populaz instance drawn from the small boroughs with only 300 constituents. I have a note here which is very brief but very pregnant. Take, for example, the county of South Cheshire, with a population of 206,000. There is only one town there, the city of Chester, containing 28,000 inhabitants, and it returns two members, while the county contains 178,000 inhabitants, and yet returns ollly two members. Thus the county of South Cheshire, with 178,000 inhabitants, returns the same number of members as the city of Chester with 28,000. I could go through almost every county in England and show the same anomalies. The subject is one on which it is of the utmost importance that the people of this country should have the niost accurate information, and that information they should learn, mnark, and inwardly digest during the Lext nine montbs, so that when the proposition of the Government, or of any Government, is made they should be able to form a sound opinion upn it, I meet every day of my life men who are oalled Consrvatives in opinionfair and honourable men, who probably have not had time to examine this question, and who often say, "There are unquestionably great anomalies in the present system. Why, the little town and the gre.-t city return the same number of members. Surely, you must disfranchise the little towns, and give the seats to the great cities." I am not opposed to every measure of Parliamentary reform which any Ministermay bring forward. I think it probable that any scheme that is introduced must do more justice to the claims which, I think, are not properly treated. But this is the point which I wish to press upon you, because it is upon it that your future conduct must depend. It is, that if we are to have a new scheme of Parliamentary Reform, these claims ought to be admitted. Perhaps you will pardon me if I put before you a few more facts. There is the case of North Cheshire, with a total population of 249,000 inhabitants, and with the two great towsu of Macclesfield and Stockport. Well, the two towns, with a population of 93,000 return four menmbers, while the rural population consisting of 156,000 returns only two. Is not that an anomaly as striking as that presented by the small county town and the large manufacturing city? Another remarkable case is that .f the county of South Derby, which has only one large town, and a total population of 166,000. The town of Derby, with 40,000 inhabitants, has two members, while the rural population, numbering 125,000, has but two. Is not that an anomaly? (Cheers.) Again, take the county of North Durham, with a total population of 272,000, and having four towns, viz. Darham, Gateshead, South Shields, and Sunderland. The town population numbers 136,000, or exactly the same as that of the county, and yet the towns aro represented by six2 members, while the county has only two. (Hear.) PerhapsI ought to apologize for giving y. u a statistical lecture, particularly ia this hot weather. (" No, no," and laugbter.) But really we live in very remarkable times. I recollectno instance of a Prime Minister dissolving Parliament, and after a general election coming down to the new House of Comi mons, aid saying his first important measure will be to reform andreconstructthem (laughter); but that as he has not made up his Tnind how to do it he will take a year to onsider of ib. (Renewed laughter.) I don't wish to criticize the future policy of the noble lord, but I think we should be the greatest idiots in the world if we aid not take the opportunity of instructing ourselves on this question, so that the noble lord may have the advanttage of the expression of the opinions of Englishimen upon it, which may influence his measures; and if his measuires are not influenced by the just views that we are attempting to maintain, at least when his scheme is brought before us we ahaU be able to criticise them with that po wer which mustaccruefrom a cornplcte knowledge of the subject. (Hear). You will, therefore, feel that I ami only doing my du' yasyour representative at this importantcrisisinlaying these factsbefore you. Well, I come to the county of Weat Kent, which has 400,000 inhabitants. Its four great towns are Chatham, Iochester, .Maid-tone, and Greenwich, with an aggregate population of 169,000. These towns return seven members, while the rural population, numbering 228,000, returns only two. That, I think, is another anomaly. (EHear, hear.) I take, next, LAncashire, that great county which hag exercised so considerable an inflience oa your fortunes and on the legislation, and even the history of this country. North Lancashire has a population of 460,000. Its four great towns are Blackburn, Wlitheroe, Lancaster, and Preston, which, -ith a population of 143,000, return seven members to Parliament, while the rural population, comprising 316,000, only returns two. I come next to that great centre of manafacturing industry-South Lancashire. It has a total populat;on of 1,500,000, or as large a popu. lation as Denmark, and alnmost as large as that of Holland. Its towns contain 1.000,000 inbabitants, aud return 15 members, while the remaining500,000 in the county return but two. ReaUy, when we are going to have a Reform Bill, and when it is the opinion, not indeed of Lord Palmerston -because he has kept that discreet silence on the sabjoct ihich usuaUy charac;erizes him (a laugh)-but the opinion of those reformers who are egging him on, that the measure to be introduced is to reduce the infnxence of the landed interest, and to increase the power of the towns, I think the time has come when we ought to meet and let the country know that we have investigated the subjectand have some clear understanding upon it, and that if we are to have a new Ieform Bill-which, it the country wants it I shall not oppose-let it at least be based on prinoiples more just than those established in 1832. If, however, we are to form any opinion from the expressions of those who are called the leading reformers of the day, we are to have a new Ieform Bill, which is no' to redress the injustice of 1832, but to aggravate it. In order to convince you that the instances Il hive quoted are not isolated, but only samples of what prevails throughout the whole arrange. n,ents of 1832, let me give you one or two further l- lustrations. East Norfolk, containing a population of 250,000, returns two menibers, while the town pulation of Norwich and Yarmouth, numbering 100,0W0, returns four. Then, there is the case of Yorkshire. The uast Riding contains a total population of 220,000. HEll and another town, with 94,000 iuhabitants between them, are represented by four members, while the remainiog 126,G00 of rural population have but two members. The great West Riding has a population of 1,300,000 ; its nine great towns, with a population of 500,000, have 16 members, while the rural population of 800,000 is represented, as usual, by two members. What I want the agricultural classes to do at the present day is, not to place themselves in the unfavourable position of saying on this or on any other great public question that they are opposed to all change. That is always a difficult position to occupy under any circum. btances, bot it is an impossible position when the Government of the country come forward as the advocates of change, and on their res?onsibility, which ought to be deeper than that of any common man, and with their know. ledge of the facts of the case, which ought to be more acc-. rate than than of any common man, tell you that a gr oat change in the representition of the country is required, and that they are prepared to propose it. Do not putyourselves in Tbe positionof opposing abstractedly overy reform thus introduced, but mnake yourselves mpsters of your case, and lay it down as a condition that, before you assent to it, the change shall be founded on principles of justice. (Cheers.) I am convinced that if you conduct yourselveg m that manner and are supported by correct information, you may safely appeal to that senso of fairness which pervades the great bulk of the people of this country; and you may be sure that no change will take place in the Parlamentary constitution of England, which is conceived in such a spirit of hostility to the landed interest as the measure of 18:2. I know it will be said that there is a fallacy in the observations that I have addressed to 3 ou, and it is not impossible that the words-uttered in this room niay be the subject of cavil and criticism. Now, so far as I aen concerned, I speak to court criticism . I do not conme down to meet you, my best and earliest friends, merely for the pleasure of seeing you here, but that I may do something to maintain your interests and sup'sort your rights. I asi prepared for this answer to my observations, and I am going to di-count it, as it were, before it is made. It will be said that I have merely taken the opulation r- presented by the towns, and that, on an hypothesis that is perfectly unjustifiable, have assumed that the rest of the , piulation is a rural and county population, vwhereas there is an immense number of people who live in towns who are not represented. It will be said that I have included these persons in the figures that I have giten in order to d(]Ide my constituents of Newport Pegnell. I will meet that answer-the only answer that can be given to the s-tntistics whbich I have laid before you, and which are taken f rem the authentic and authoritative tables of the public census. I have taken the trouble to investigate the number of inhabitants of this country wtho live in the unrenrecoalted towns, and I shall place before you of 'the sh"lrtest and most pregnant documents ever read on this all-importaut subject to a body of Englishmen. I have. 4 1 England pqpror as the subject of my illust;_4o1 tion for the obvious sake of simplity. in treland, cof. land, and even in Wales there are variletie3 Of franchse and diverse arrangements respectingl the boroughs, wheres throughout England the franchise is similar and the politi cal ineidents of the boroughs are exactly the same. The example I sba}l give is on a scale so extensive as to be perfectly conolusive on the general question. There are 144 county members in England, and t ey represent a wpulation of 9777.000, which gives one member of Pawriament for every 67,883 inhabitants. There are 319 borounl mem. bers, representing a population of 7,144,000, which gives one member for every 22,384. I ehall deduct the population of the unrepresented towns, which are supposed to be represented by the county menbers. Their population is exactly 1,000 000 Therefore the 144 county memb,rs will represent 8,777,000, whick gives one nmemDber for every 60,869 persons ; while the 319 borough members wil represent a population of 8,144,678, givingonememberfor every25,535. So thatwhenIhave rectified the balance and thrown into the boroughs what they have no right to have, the case stands thus-that you have one member in the countiesforevery61,0OD,and one in the boroughs for every 25,000. Are not these important facts? And when we are told that there are to be new reform bills framed according to the opinions of the leading reformers of the country, with a view to diminish what they call the undue preponderance of the landed interest, are we to take no steps to make our position known? And when EDgland may be calledupon to deoideunsome moment of passion on some Parliamentary reform, brought forward perhaps for the purpose of confirming a party in power, ougbt not these facts to be well driven into the convictions and conscience of the political mind of England? (Hear, bear.) Y..u woald be acting a suicidal part if, knowing quite well that a reform bill vas to be insitoduced in deference to the opinions of those who think that the classes connected with the land have too much political power, YOU were not to awaken the oountry to the real state of thecase as I have revealed it to you. (Hear, bear.) Tndisposed, therefore, as I am to disturb the settlement of 1832, still, if a great political change is contemplated and introduced on the responsibility of the Minister of the Crown, I shall give his proposition a dispassionate consideration, and endeavour to vindicate the interests which I think have been so long injured. (Hear, hear.) I have only one remark to add on the subject of Parliamentary Reform. So coolly is it assumed by Parliamentary reformers that any change in our representative system must diminish the infiaence of the landed interest that you mneet persons every day, and persons, too, regarding themselves as by no means violent reformers, who want to alter the county franchise. They are for adopting a reduced franchtse that will curtail the legitimate influence of the landed interest by admitting into the county constituencies persons unconnected with that interest. That. I think, would be a most impolitic course. Whatever plans of Parliamentary reconstruction may be proposed, we ought to adhere to the great distinction which has always prevailed in our constitution, and which was ado pted after grave consultation in 1832-namely, that we should aknolow ledge the franchise of the towns to arise out of occupation, and that of the counties out of the ownership and cultivation of the soiL It is impossible that any sane man can conceive the project to increase ths county constituencies, which bave already fewer members and a larger population than the boroughs, and at the same time not to deal with the borough constituencies. Than such a proposal nothing could be more monstrous or unsatisfactory. It aggravates the injustice and increases the very poli tical evil which ought to be redressed. If there is to be a change in the electoral body, it ought to be an increase in the constituencies of the boroughs. If, therefore, you calmly consider this question with especial reference to the position and influence of the land, nothing could be more unjust, absurd, and anomalous than the schemes of reform hitherto propounded. (Cheers.) I shall now leave that which is put forward as the question of the day. It is hardly necessary for me to trouble you at any length upon other topics Thore is one subject, however, upon which I think the people of this country ought to be prepared to come to a definite opinion, and thatis as to the position which the established church is to maintain in th8r Constitution. ([lear, he%r.) I do not mean to enter into the controversy which has arisen with reSpect to the parties which exist in the Church of England. There never wvas a penod when these parties did not more or less prevail, and although one thing cannot be denied-namely, that there never was a time when one of these parties was predominant that its predominance was not injurious to the church, it must still be candidly admitted by all dispamionate men that the competition, if I .may use the expreesion, between the two parties which have now prevailed in the church for more than two centuries has on the whole been beneficial to this country. While, on the one hand, what we familiarly call "low church" has checked the advance of priestly domination, on the other hand, what we call h nigh church" has saved us from the consequences of latttudinarian practices. I am myself in favour of that via media which the most eminent prelates of the country h wve ever since the Reformation maintained and upheld. (Cheers.) I desire to see a fuU and complete ecclesiastical establishment on the basis of a true Protestant feeling; but, at the same time, I wish to see our ecclesiastical polity maintained in its spirit and truth. The question, however, which is now rapidly advancing, and which the people of this country will be called upon to decide-I believe even in this Parliament-is not whether you shall h%ve what is . called "high church" or "low church," but whether you shall have a national church established in this realm, forming an important part of its politicl constitution. This question you will very speedily be called upon to decide when the subject of church-rates is brought before you,-a question the discussion of which it has for many years been convenient to evade, but which, you may depenad upon it, before 12 months have passed, wil in the conse quences of its settlement be one of the utmost importance to this country. I have' brought to this subject, I believe, as calm a consideration as any man can well command, but I cannot conceal from myself that the movement against church-rates is a politicai movement. I have arrived at that conclusion from facts which are before us. They are these :-By the law of England, as it at present stands, no church-rate can be levied without the consent of a maority of the ratepsyers, and I should suppose that it is a distinguishing characteristic of Englishmen to defer always to the sense of a majority. It is therefore clear that a church-rate cannot be levied in any district unless there is a predominant opinion in its favour. Now, how do we find that the law practically acts? We have before us returns from the 12,wvp3nshas into which England is divided. In how many parishes, do you suppose, according to the last returns. chureb-rates have been refused ? Why, only in 600 out of the whole 12,000. (Hear, hear.) When, then, we find, under a law so liberal in its conception that the opinion of the majority absolutely decides the question of assessment, that only 5 per cent. of the 12,000 parishes-and those, of course, situated in large towns-have availed themselves of the privilege of withholding a church-rate, it is impossible for me to accept as a grave conclusion that this institution -if I may so call it-as it now exists, is opposed to the feelings and convictions of the people. (Cheers.) It is, however, impossible to deny that in this question, left as it is-and perhaps wisely-to the decision of the majority-is involved the whole question of a church establishment. Even if the majority had a conscientio-as objection to the payment of church-rates, and you were called upon to terminate them, you would have to decide the great question whether you would maintain an establishment or not. Circumstances, however, have not come to such a point as to place us under the painful necessity of weighing the advantages of an established church against the general convictions and sentiments of the comniunity. It is clear, however, that every objection urged against church.rates might be equ lly urged against tithes, and might even be carried to a greater length. I the conscientious objection of individuals is to be allowed to prevail against the maintenance of a national institution, I am at a loss to understand how any national institation of tbis coantry is to be upheld. It has so happened that by negligence in the public mind, and its failing to see what importnt questions were involved in that of churchrates, the subject has assunmed an importance which cannot be exaggerated, and it is one that must be brought to a public and Parliamentary solution. It is not possible that doring the present Parliament the opinion of the House and of the Governmont should not be taken on that subject, and therefore it becomes you upon this question, no less than upon that of Parliamentary Reform, to smake up your minds as to what you. will change and vrhat you will maintain. You cannot allow this matter to go on any longer as it is. If you wish to uphold the institutions of your country you must take your side upon this subject, for, although he was attacked for it by his supporters, Lord John Russell never spoke more soundly thau when he said that aUl our inastitutions were at stake inthe settlement of this question. (Hear, hear.) One word upon the institutions of our country. I am in favour of progress,-in favour of the political, social, and intellectual progress of this country. I think that any man who is the Minister of England ought to pursue the policy which, in his opinion, wvll make the people of England the freest, happiest, and moat enlightened people in the world; but Iam also, and have always been, of opinion that this result can only be obtained by maintaining and def~erring to our ancient institutions. There are many well-meaning men who are enamoured of the American institutions and of those of our great colonies. They say that results of great value are obtained wvithout the ialueiice of the institutions of this country of wnich we are so proud, and to which I hope we may still remain devo:ed. There is, however, this difference between our country and those to which I have referred. In the old countries of Europe, and especially in what we. are proud to call "Old England," you caunot make anygreat change without destroying, whereas inAnstraliaor America nothing is destroyed, but everything is created, What wrould be the consequence of destroying our ancient institutions? There have been old countries of Europe which have tried that experiment, and what is the result of their experience ? Destroy a monarchy and yoa will have a Royalist party in the country. Change a dynasty, and you will have a Legitimist party. Sabvert a church, and you will have an ecclesiastical party. Put an end to an hereditary nobility, and you will have a large body of proprietors discontented with the state of affairs. (Cheers.) What are the consequences of this? Civil war and constant revolutions. England cannot afford to have a civil war; England cannot afford constant revolutions. If an old country like this, with a system of credit like ours, lost a period of her history in initernal struggle orrevolution, would she not, when she again became tranquil, findthatother countries-such as that on the other side of the Atlantic-had outstripped her in the race ? As long as we are faithful to ourselves,as long as we improve but do not destroy, it is impossible to predict to what height of pride and power England may attain. I will not refer to the 30 years' war of the Roses, the like of which may never again occurin England,-I will take the war of the great rebellion. If we underwent political revolutions such as some of our neighbouxs have experienced during the last 50 years. the position of England at their termination would not be that which she aS present occupies. (Cheers.) She might become tranquil, the people might find themselves free and in the posession of much pLyeic3} enjoyment, but she would no longer be, as at present, as first-rate State. She would not be the leading Power of E:urepe She would become what Sw eden and the other cai$inaviaii States are at the present day, and the result of iniprorement effcted by destruction would be to lower the inflnence of onr counbtry instead of to accomplish, as might bt ee by de epsg fic, and through the. agency Of@ QMXI present institutIs, the maintenance anidlevation of ouIr present position. (Hear, hear.) I hlay8 thNght that the eminent person who muked me what I shodd agy to my eonstituentashould withyeuidu]gencerecahvea*ntger, andI hope that what I have mid may be produt*ive o! some advantage, and may at least lead my constituents mg o.hers of the people of Eogland to, sonder weli on the aspeor of affairs duing the interval whicb shall elapwe before tle changes with which we are tbreatened are propoed. 1 wait to induce what in old days. was called the landed interest!'-I do not mean merely or mainly the 'Squire, but the occupiers and cultivators of thesoildispasnoately to review their pofition. We live isa a period when thos who wish to be respected must respec themselve. You will not-have your rights conceded, yeu, wil not have r fair and legitimate privileges maintained, if you yourees, not knowmg your own case, are silent aud prepared to submit to any unjust arrangenset that mav be proposed. Men suffer injustice, not only from tha igoanc of those who injure them, bat also from neglect of their own interests. I amt quite sure that if the case of the land had been fairly put before the Parliament of 1832, it is so strong and so full of elements whichcom mand the interest of Englishmen that a very different arrangement would have been made. UTnderstand that Tam not for a moment attempting to revive a quarrel, now long forgotten, between ourselves and the great centres of manufactng and commercial industry. I donot grudge Man. chester, Liverpool, or Bradford, or the great tovns of Laucashire and York shire, their representatives. I am Rlad to see them in the Houe of Commons. I a'm quike willing to admit that if they can establish a claim it Ought to he recomnized in any great changes which may take plaee. (Hear, hear.) I now offer no argument, I put forward no scheme, I give to the country facts-facts collected from authentic and authoritative douments-and if any one can cntradict or refute them they will have ample opportanity to do so before the next session of Parliament. If they show that four towns having but one-third of the popu. lation of the county ought to be represented by eight members, while the county itself has but two, let them offer their" ments to the fair and impartial judgment of the people oTngland- (Cheers.) If they can deny that, taking population as the element of representation-which, by the by. is a great' concession; it is a test which mauy, refuse to take, but it is their own test-if they can deny that one-half of the population of this kingdom is represented by 140 members, and less than the other moiety by 320, and that because they live ini towns, let them go to the market-place of every town and prove that what I am stating is "romance" and mere imagination. As long, however, as we have public records, and as long as those documents are, by means of a free press, accessible to the wbole people, I do not believe that these statements can be refuted or denied. It is only as facts that I offer them; I leave it to the people of England to draw from them their own conclusions. (Hear hear.) If there is to be a political change, it ought to be one devised and carried out for the advantage of no party whatever. (Oheers.) It is to calm, comprehensive publiec opinion that I address myself. If the question is fully and fairly considered, if the due influenice of the landed interest in al its ramifications is recognized, I care not how you reconstruct your Parliament, I care not how you adjust your franchiEe, I believe that the institutions of this country will be maintained, and maintained because they answer the wants and wishes of the people. (Cheers.) I thank you for the kind manner in which you have recelved me to-day. I have not entered into party politics. I do not depreciate parties. I am a pary man, and I believe every mnan here is a party man, because in a free country it is the duty of every subject to have definite idess on all the great questions of the day. Party politics are, however, much suspended for the moment by accident, and it is only when the great questions to which I have adverted shall be brought forward for determination in the House of Commons that parties Willagain appear to assert whatare on either side the opinions of the great body of their followers. With regard to party politics I will only venture to say that I made two predictions at the time of the elections which have been realized, although the first of them was much questioned when I expressed my opinion that a year of legislative progress would be wasted. It is, however, now pretty evident that nothing will be done during the present year. I also made a reference to the future. I said that I looked forward with no dissatisfaction to the dissolution of Parliament counselled by Lord Palmerston, because I felt that it would at least have this beneficial influence-that it would tend to bring about in thE House of Commons that wholesome state of the two great constitutional parties with distinctive principles and ideas which I thought was necessary to the right action of ourconstitution, and the want of which during the last 10 years has been conducive to so much dissatisfaction and disaster. I think that a great step has already been taken in that direction. I look forward myself to the late appeal to the people witbout any apprehension. I wish to speak of all those who for a long time time sat in the Eiouse of Commons with due respect, but unquestionably we had there sections of men and individuals self-satisfied with their own power, which everybody was willing to a certain degree to acknowledge, but who would neither govern themselves nor allow any one else to do so. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) It is greatly to the publicadvantage that although they were men Tighly gifted, and great ornaments of that assembly, tbey no longer hold seats in it. The public business will be carried on more efficiently; for, in the exact proportion that party distinctions are not respected in the House of Commons, that House will fall in the esteem of the people. As long as you have two great organized patties ot men acting upon distinct principles and avowed policies, Parliamentary govern ment, especiallv for this country, is the best government that n be devised. But an assembly of 654 gentlemen, with no political connexion or discipline, each willing to follow his own conceits and to gratify his own ambition, would soon subside into the most inefficient and corrupt assembly in the world. (Hear, hear.) We may not have obtained all that we desire, but at any rate we have now a House of Commons free from thoss anomalies, and I have no doubt that if public opinion is as enlightened as I believe it will be before the impendiag changes are proposed, you will have it declared that such a policy as I have intimated to you will be pursued-a policy that will maintain the institutio's of England. I hardly know how I may venture to describe this policy. We live in an age of a novel nomenclature of patties; but I am sure You will bear with me-for it is an ancient weakness-if I say that these great principlesprinciples which would promote the prosperity and greatness of England through the preservation of her institutions-are, in my mind, Tory principles. (Cheers.) They are principles which I think wil yet triumph in this country; but they can only triumph by discussion, which they do not fear; by the circulation among the people Of accurate information on the great questions of the day;* and by that sympathy from public opinion without which in the present ate no political organization can endure. [The right hon. gentleman concluded amid vociferous and prolonged cheers.] The remainder of the proceedingsposseised an exclusively local interest.

THE UNITED SfAZWS' STEAMA FPZGAT I lN2IAOtAM B. Hal-a-mile or so beoW Graveend, just about where the river tourist might expect to recover from having meens the Great EssWrn t Mfiwai, another monster of the deep stands full in view. She is vast as an ark, with a peculiar defiaut air, and an expression which tells you .at once that sho wag made for other. than the peaoe. fuW purposes of commer, though nothing in the way Of aXmanment, orevenin theeim of yards, denotes themanof-rar. This ship, along wbeee deCAch a crowd of fashionable visitors daily and hourly a , and all round which lie a feet of shore boats "mxsYerssof te situation," and nLaldng as mucb of it *a if the President himaelf Was on view, is the Ar-fafmed frdgate Niagara. She is, 'we believe, the first States' frigate that has ever anchored off Gravesend. Let our :eadro, therefore, or at least such of them as love to gaze upon noble specimes of naval architecture, avail themselves ott,uno UDtI oppor. tutity. Such an one will not soon agahapresent itself* for in Eize, form, speed, and intendea weight otarmamentthe Niagara is beyond doubt the first man-of-war of her crass in the wholo world. As the visitor apprasoeles her lofty sidEs, he is struck with the ey gracernli manner in which she "sits" the water, with her bDwe1- wel up slowly rising, and showing off her beautif lihes and clear ran to fine advantage. But beyond this feature the general effect of her exterior is not very plea ing. The dark black hull, unrelieved by a single streak of white, gives a heavy appearance quite foreign to her-shape She is also very hollow in the waist, which impast tha% wall-sided aspect so charicteristic of the Ameriean liners, but which their fine frigates, except in. this instance, havo managed to avoid, or at leatt mitigate. She is ship-rigged, with tall and somewjsat heavY spars,-a novel feature in an American screw, as their builders have justly prided themselves on avoiding our practice of overmasting our steamers, But, heavy as the Niagara seems aloft, she has not a rope or spar too much. On the contray, the marvel is that they can do the work ascribed to them, for under sail alone she can run, it is said, from 16 to 17 knots an hour ! This is speed w hich even our river skamboat would count as excellent. Fro m the spar-deck the Niagara looks by no means imposing. The bulwarks are 'of -uch unusual loftiness and so curved in as apparently lo diminish her real size. In fact, many of our frlgates, less than half her size, and not to to compared to her in any warlike or seagoing quality, seem larger on the deck. Not till the visitor has walkedforward and perched himself somewherenearthe bowsprit, canhefulyappreciateher immense size and beau. tiful form, and feel that he is looking down on such a war. steameras the world has not let seen theequal of, andby tte side of which the English n avy can showv nothing to compete. The Niagara is one of 12 steam-frigates which a short time since the Congress ordered to be built, by way of a counterbalanoe to the enormous increase of the English and French marine. The co nstruction of the Niagara was intrusted by acclamation to Mr. Steers, the builder of the celebrated clipper yacht America. In building her he had four conficting purposes toreco ncile,-to make her a good gunboat, good seaboat, good sailer, and good skamer. The result is the Niagara; in design a kind of compromise, and which leaves her the fastest sailer in the world, one of the fastest steamers, a fine- seaboat, and a very good man-of-war. Her length over aU is 375 feet, breadth (extrame) 56 feet 6 inches,depth of hold 32 feet 6 inchep, and her barden 5,200 tons, or nearly 2,000 tons larger than the Himalaya. Now she has on board only four small gaus,-that is, small in c-mparison to the armament she is intended to carry; but when the peaceful task of laying the Atlantic submarine cable is com. pleted the Niagara wil be fully armed and equipped for war. She wiU then carry 12 Dahlgren guans, 11. inches diameter in the bore, and throwing a solid shot of the enor. mous weight of 2701b. a distan ce of 7,000 yards, or four miles; The sholls for these guns will weigh 1301b., and the gunsthemselves 14tons. These monster ordnance, which seems as if we were reverting to the barbarism, of gunnery, and would come at last to the unwieldy pieces of the Dardanelle3, with bores of 28 inches diameter. havealreadybecn cast at the West Point foundry, near New York. We cartainly wish that the Niagara had had only one of these tremendous artillery on board, as it would have enabled us better to appreciate her warlike capacities. Inspecting a man-of-war without her armament is much likejuadng of the strength of alion byhisskin. Atfirst 12 guns seem but a small offensive power for a vessel of upwards of 5,000 tons, and it is only by reflecting on the stupendous calibre of her equipment that one begins to understand how formidable she will be, and to feel curious doubts as to the result of a contest between such a frigate and the largest three-decker. We have said that while alonggide the spars seem heavy; yet, from the deck, compared with the vast bulk of the hull, they appear almost too light. Their extreme length from step to track is-m3inmast 213 feet; foremast 219; and mizen 189. The mainyard is 106 feet long, and the foreyard 94. Between the Ibulwarks whispering pipes are laid running from the quarter deck to forecastle, and aU the officers' orders are thus transmitted with the most perfect certainty and speed. Without some contrivance of the kind a vessel of such enormous length would be both difficnult and dangerous to manage; for, no matter how large ships may be bailt, there are most narrow lhmits to what onepair of Ilngs can effect, and in breezy weather Stent(r himself would be inaudible at half the length of tie N'agara. The engine-room of this magnificent vessel is as deeply interestingtothe visitor as any other part of her. The whole motivepo wer is placed amidships, and so carefully constructed as to occupy less space with regard to force employed than the engines of any ordinary vesseL Fore and aft the machinery in all its departments is boundedby two traverse water-tight compar tments, which complete y shut it in from the rest of the vessel. The engine-room is about 23 feet long by 26 wide, and nine staircases are so arranged as to make aU parts of it easily accessible. The engines are by Murphy and Ca., of New York. There are three, all direct acting, three feet stroke,with connecting rods between the cylinders and cranks. The cylinders a, e 72 inches In diameter (nearly the same size as those of the Great Eastern), and placed horizontally across the vessel, o that the motion of the piston is from side to side. Tie shaft upon which the whole force is brought to bear is 119 feet long, 50 inches in circumference, and weighs nearly 50 tons. The propeller is of brass, with two fans, nearly 19 feet in diameter, and having a pitch of 32 feet. On the prominent parts of the machinery are placed admirably. contrived indicators, which mark at the Eame time the number of revolutions, pressure of steam, vacuum, tempera. tare of the hot well, and pressure of the cylinder at all parts of stroke. The cylinders are all on the starboard side of the vessel, the condensers on the port. Each of the latter has within itself the airpump and hot well. The air. pumps are double acting, and work direct from the main piston-rod, as do also the force pum ps. A six inch bilhe injection is attached to each condenser, an d can be used a t a moment's notice to free the ship from water. In addition to these there are two bilge pumps, connected by the creak shaft to the engine, and in constant operation, so that at bn times the hold is as dry asa chip. The fire room or stoke hole is unusually wide and lofty, though it seems but indifferently ventilated, and suspicions on this head are confirmed by the fact that in crossing the Atlautir, even at this time, the heat in it was sometimes 110 degrees. What would it be in the West Indies? There are fonrboilers on the vertical tubular pricciple. Each of them is 21 feet long by 11 feet deep, and 15 feet high, and has a total fire surface. of no less than 17,500 feet, and a grate surface of 484 square feet. Working at a pressure of 201b, gives a power of 2,000 horess, and at that force the revolutions are only 45 per minute During the voyage from New York the consumption of co. 1 was at some periods as low as 12 tons per day, and it never rose above 56 1 The average for ful power may be taken at 50 tons per diem, or very little more than the consumption of some steamers in the English navy which cannot do their 10 knots an hour. The stowageroom of the Niagara for coals is rather limitee, considering her immense capacity in other respects. A Uttle over 800 tons is the most that can be carried. This however, suffices for 16 days' steaming at full spee.' Neither is the vessel provided with any apparatus for dis. tilling fresh wat,r for the crew, a rather serious drawback when the stowage is wanted for coals. The funnels are telescopic, and neither heavy nor unsightly, though only rising 32 feet from the deck. So admirably ;s the heat of the loilers economized that even under full steam the tempera. ture of these funnels is rarely above 100. The lower deck, bhioh, for a lower deck, is one of the most lofty and best ventilated we have seen, is set apart for the stok-ers, firemen, &.o. The main deck is used by the crew, andis no less than 8 feet 4 inches high. Here the seamen sling their hammocks, the ettroine after-part being, of course, devoted to officers' cabins, and the fore to cooking for the ship's company. llTry sailor on board has hi5 locker, and each mess a vQy large locker for the mess kit. At present tho crew is 514, exclusive of officers, but when fully armed, even this lope complement is to be increased to 750 men-the crew ad a 90-gun ship. During the voya%t- across the Atlantio no attemapt was made to effect a %uiek passage ; cn the contrary, the engines were zeetly working at half poewer. AU tlhe rigging had he%T, putup duzing the depth of an American ,wint.p, and, %. tbo ship zemcbed the moist and warmer latitudes it d4henX&.to an Uxta that nade it more than probable the cti,icke, wotld comw out of her altogether, especially dxaiing igoue days o4f t#idowy heavy weather.

In the urse of a day or so the Niagara will leave the Thames for JAverpool, where her halfof the Atlantice able is to be shipped.

THE ATLANTIC ELEg'R*P2r, TO THE EDITOlO0P r TRY TIMMS., Sir,-The telegraphic caMe- whicris- being manafhavaed 'or submersion between IreAndand fewfoundianc.appearo to bean object of some little interest. A good deal has been recently said'or the subject withoutcomrmunicating any definite informatten relative to' the' meet ctitical operation connected with- the project-nasmely, the best mode of submerging ilie oable. K3ay we, therefore, beg to invite attention thzsugli*your valuable joumrn if you think fit, to a plan for saubmergin. cable& in deep oceans which has hitherto been unhried ?. It ecasists in the use of a trail or fixible tubs-attchedito the stern of the ship' through whid4. a cabre mary h sfelr submerged in the deepest ocean in jnsosh any ste of the' weather. Trails can be contructed in variva& Ways,. a may, i desirable, be made of the same sp cifiegravity as-the Able itself. A wire rope with a light metallic vertebmted tnbe in.the centre would probably answer well,-i may bepartraUly sustned in the water f or the first half*zaile fxom the ship bym al gatta percha buoys made in the ferm.ofa.fish'Aoaw attached to it at intervals, or by an airtight gutta perchb tube. A strong gutta percha tube, strengtbened for the firsthalf.mile from the ship with a covering of wire, would alsW bea good conductor. It should be of sufficient lengths to. reach into still water at such a dia tance from the ship as would place the extreme end beyond the initoeno. of acw motion. which may be given to the inner end by the pitching of the ship, orfrom any other cause; orit maybe of suffiient. length to reach to the bottom of the ocean. Thhetrailbeing asit were par tand parcel of the ship acts as a carrier for the cable, and thus VirtuaUy aihilates the distance between the ship and the bottom of the oean,. or still water, except to the extent of the friction of the. cable in the tube; aud as the motion at the extrejaa end of the trail would be steadyand uniform in its passage tkrougk the water (the speed of the ship being uniform, howeverUnsteady its motion) the delivery of the cable would also be. steady aud uniform,-and as the cable cannot enter into th.- tube at the upper end f aster than it passes out of it at the lower end, it follows that any strain which otherwise would be thrown on the cable at its pointof contact with theship from any cause whatever would be borne by the trail itself instead of by the cable. In fact, thLe cable in its page throUgh the tube is completely protected from any strain, and from all other circamstances which might be injurioun to it. It may readily be seen that if a trail be submergedin a' vertical position, the cable would pass through it without any strain at the lower end; it would in this position re_ quire a brake at the upper end to prevent its too rapie egress. It is equally obvious that if the trail be plaoed in a horizontal podtion the cable would require some force at the outer end to draw it throngh the tube, and consequently would not require any bra ke at the inner end to check its egres3. It therefore follows from these two self-evident facts that there is a position between the vertical and horlAzontxl in which the cable would deliver itself without any strain at the lower end of the tube, and without requiring any brake at the upper end. To obtain the proper declivity for the trail it would be only necessary to ascertain the velocity at which the cable would sink in the water, and after maling due allowance for the increasing or diminishing depth of the ocean, to regulate the speed of the ship accordingly. The friction of the cable in the tube would act as a brake%. with the great advantage of its operating throughout thee entire length of the tube instead of on a few yards orfathoms of the cable on board the ship. If a trail be used, it wrould be of course absolutely neces sary to guard against kinks in the cable; but, viewing the. description of cable in question, and the abundanee of manual labour which, under the direction of slilful judg_ ment, may be employed on the occasion, there need scaredr be any fear in that particular. The cable should not be encumbered with many mechanical arrangements on board ship; perhaps the less the better. If submersion of a cable is made from the centre of an. ocean towards shore, the trail (if a metallic one) may bh dir. connected from the ship on her arrival in shallow water, and allowed to sink with the cable. It would thus affori that protection which. the cable so circumstanced will require. Without enumerating all the advantages that wouldi attend the use of a trail, it may be well to observe that its, adoption wiU enable a comparatively inexpensive description of cable to be used, as great strength would not ho required. The insulation of the telegraphic wires woulc perhaps scarcely need any other protection in deep oceans than would be necessary to prevent abrasion in its passage throngh the tube. We are, Sir, your most obedlent semvnie. WITT,MNR A NTn WV A 'P TTVDTU 39, Wapping, May 13.

FOEBIGN INKTLLIGENCE. P- - O--- - FRANoE. A oroof tho foUo7ig apped in our seoad edi. (moM OUR OWN CORRBEPOND)NTA PARIS., TUSSDAY, MAY 19, 6 P.M. It is now pretty certain that the Govemraent will mainti the stahzs 2uowithregard to the Legislative Body. Very nearly the same deputies will be presented as candidates at the approaching elections, and M. de Conegliano, who is attached to the Emperor's household, and who was to have entered the lists against M. de Montalembert in the department of the I)oubs, has been instructed to remain quiet, either because there is an unwiringnesz to priss teo hardly on the latter, cr that there was a norminty of his triumphing over the Government nominee. The authorities will neither support nor cppose M. de Montalembert; they probably make a -irtue of necessity. In truth, the elections are a mere matter of form. As to the majority heing obtained for the Government, there never vas any doubt. But the most unfortunate symptom is the absence of all interest on the part of the people- in the el(-:tions. The people seem utterix careless about th-.. exercise of their rights, and if the Iec-islative Body were named in toto by the Emperor I doubt whether it would make any difference. That such is the feeling-or rather, the absence of all feeling-on the subject is shown by the reports of the Prefects of departments, and it explains why hardly any exertion is necesxary on the part of the Government to secure a triumph. The difficulty now is to make the electors come forward in something like respectable numbers. The system has certainly succeeded in rendering torid all political life in France. Hlow long such a state of things wi last it is difflicult to say. It will require some extraordinary event to rouse the public mind from its lethargy, but when roused the avakening will indeed be felt. For the present every attempt to awaken the people to anything likepolitical activityis at once encountered by the high hand of authority'. The SiEcle published, a day or two ago, an article exhorting the voters to exercise their rights, and to reject the counsels of those who would have them abstain from the ballot. It showed that, considered as a political demonstration, such conduct was as insignificant as it was unpatriotic; that it was but the admission of defeat, and that it furnished the most powerful arguments to the opponents of a liberal suffrage. It advocated the nornination of men representing moderate views, from the greater probability of success, and it warmly recommended its own political friends, to show that they are not deficient in civil courage, the want of which would prove the political infirmity of France. There was nothing very subversive in this language-nothing in it dangerous to a system which, we are told, is based upon such solid foundations. Nevertheless, the S&&e has received an admonition, not officially, but in a private way, to refrain from such exhortations. I believe, however, that this excessive sensitiveness is found more in those who surround the Emperor than in himself. The men who were, not long ago the clamorous advocates of liberty bordering on lawlessness, are now startled at the shadow of anything that bears a remote resemblance to it. They have helped to stamp out the last spark of its existence, and are now afraid of the ghost of their victim. The Emperor is mortified at this general apathy; he would prefer a little animation, not much, certainly, but, at all events, sufficient to show that his system has not utterly annihilated political life in France. They who are under him think differently. The members of the Conference on the Neuchatel question are expeted to meet on an early day. Therevwill probably be but one more sitting, to giRn, seal, and deliver. The affair, as you are already informed, may be considered as settledthat is, if any dependence can be placed on the KCing of Prussia. E:ven the indemnity is now given up. Three weeks ago, indeed, this tantalizing affair might have been terminated as now, and the King would then have had the appearance of doing voluntarily and with a good grace what is n extorted from him. Some o were importance have yet to be arranged, and I believe no day is yet fixed for signing the protocol It cannot, however, be far distant. It is rumoured that the King of Prusia serlously contemplates a visit to Pars. A certain number of Hungarian refugees, who have resided here since 1849, have presented themselves at the Austrian Embassy to demand passports to return home, in consequence of the amnesty granted by the Emperor of Austria. Feruk lKhan, the Persian Ambassador, went today to Fontainebleau, it is said for the purpose of thanking the Emperor for his good offices in the arrangement of the differences between England and the Shah. Lord Cowley went yeaterdaytoFontoinebleau, and had an audience of their Majeaties to present letters from Queen Victoria notifying the birth of a Princess. A letter from Fontainebleau, dated yesterday, says:- "The Emperor and the King of Bavaria this afternoon in a small carriage driven by the former and followed by some of their officers, took a drive in the forest. A great number of guests, among whom are several of the Ministers, arrived to-day at the Palace, where they are to pass the week. In the evening the comedians of the Th6ttre Fran. vais performed the Bataille des Dames. On this occasion numerous invitations had boen sent to the principal functionaries and notable inhabitants of the town, as well as to the officers of the garrison." A letter from Creusot, dated Sunday evening, at G1 o'clock, says .- "The Grand Duke Constantine arrived yesterdaymorning, at 5 o'clock, at the station of Chagny (Saone.et-Lcire), and thence cane acrosa the country to this place by post, a distance of about 20 miles. The Prince was accompanied by M. Schneider, Director-General of the establishment, and by the Marquis de Belmont, Colonel Fav6, and Baron de Bour. going, appointed by the Emperor Napoleon to attend him 'while in France, and by his own personal suite. The ironworlss of Creusot are justly celebrated, and may he reckoned superior to anything in France. The establishment is admirably situated, and pre3ents a most picturesque appear. ance. The commune of the same name, which lies to its left, contains about 15,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom are employed at the works. The establishment is an ancient one, but its products did not begin to be sought for until 1822, when it entered on the make of iron by maeans of coke. Since then it has gone on constantly increasing, employing in 1837 2,400 workmen, in 1847 5,500, and in 1857 nearly 10,000. It contains no less than 150 coke-ovens, burning each year 250,000,000 kilogrammes of coals, and 10 large blast furnaces, transforming into iron 160,000,000 kilogrammes of ore. The head of this great establishment, M. Schneider, Vice-President of the Legislative Body, was accompanied on the occasion of the Grand Duke's visit by his son, a lad of 16, who is pursuing his education in one of the colleges of Paris. After the inspection of the different workshops began, at about 9 oclock. After having gone rapidly through the principal parta of the establishment, the Prince visited the foundry, witnessing the casting of a large cylinderfor a steam engine. The whole was effected in an instant, in the usua way, by two workmen manceaulng an immense cauldronl of liquid iron, which, by means of A crane, they poured into a mould prepared beforehand. The Imperial visitor then opened a now furnace. Receiving a torch from the foreman, he set fire for the first time to the charge it contained. His Imperial Highness laughed heartily on loarning that the fire thus commenced would be kept bumning without intermisuox for seven years, The Portion of the foundry sMt anart for artioles required in the navy particularly interested the Prince, and his inquiries were numerou, In the part of the works where copper boilers ae manufactured for the navy six were heated and made before him in the course of a few minutes, the Whole being riveted by steam with almost the rapidity of enchantment. The Prince then pet some time in the locomotive department, and nearly an hour in the model room. Ho also spent a considerable time in examining the engine whichhad been made for tho Bayan corvette, 300-horse power, in course of constraction at Bordeaux for the Rusaian Government. The Imperial party then prooeeded to the fitting and turning roomS, and were much struck by the immense amount of labour, some of it of a most delicato character, performed by steam. On leaving that part of the building, M. Schneider directed the attention of the Prince to a military railway lately invented by the Bmperor Napoleon. It oonsista of rails and chairs all fiting exaotly into cach other, and firmly swured bymeows of bolts and Ecrews. Curves of various rsdii can be mad without difficulty, and every possible direction can be given to the line. According to trials made, a regimeni cm esily lay down in 10 hours two miles and a half of thl railway. The pinting rooms for loomotives wer next gone through; and the party thea camo to tho other pat of tihe foundry works; where the noLa3 and Activity wbieh prevall would almcet give one the idea of Pandemoninm. The Grad Duke was paticularly struck with the powerful actowo the Namyth skam ham- n ers. These tromenaous machines wicbghiug frm %ODO tcZ l2Z000kiogramrues each, and which o in ctdt equally thiouga a beam of iron or fall on a watchglass without breaking it, perform an immense quantity of work at Creusot. - The Grand Duke was so struck with ail he saVw that he added to the order which had provioudy been given for the Rlusaian Government that of an engine of 450.horso power for a figote, and another of 400-horse power for a yaoht for the Emperor. Of the men emploYecd oi the works each' pays Into a fund 2 per cont, of his wages, which suzm provides them with medaical attendanco when ill, pas for teachers for their children, and gives a pension to suchasbecomecinfirm. un addition to the schools, there is a large workshop where the female children are taught to make lace. This establishment was formed by madame Schneider, and will hereafter be of immaense benefit to the country, as the lace made there is already much in demand. After the inspection of the premises, the Grard Duke and his suite were entertained at an early dinner by M. Schneider, who proposed the helth of the Prince, and thanked him for having honoured his establishment with a visit. During the dinner the Orpheonist Society, camposed of young men belonging to the works, executed several mormccaux, which drew forth an expression of admiiation from the Prince. The Grand Duke quitted Creusot at a quarter-past 3, passing through a compact crowd, by vrhom he was hailed with the loudest acclamations," The Grand Dluke returned to Paris from Creusot on Saturday night, and left again at 2 o'clock yesterday morning by the Orleans Railway, and arrved at Tours at half-past 6. General Grobon and Colonel de Trelo, of the Staff, received the Prince on his alighting from the carriage. A collation had been piepared for the Prince, who, after taking some refreshments and putting on hia military uniform, left for Saumur. The Prefect and General Cuny, who wereon the point of settingoutto attend thedifferent councils of revision, 'had just time to be presented to his Imperial Highness. After being present at a carrouseland some manceuvres at the Cavalry School, his Imperial Highness returned to the station at Tours, where a d&je4ier of 30 covers was prepared in one of the waiting-rooms, and to which the Prince invited General Grobon, Colonel de Trelo, atd M. Bourdillon, the Commandant of the (lendarmerie. At 1 o'clock his Imperial Highness left for Bordeaux, where he was to arrive yesterday evening. The French Government is about to build a steam yacht at Cherbourg, on the model of a cutter of the second class, to offer as a present to the King of Siam. I am informed that the Council of State has adopted the opinion of the Legislative Body with respect to the Transatlantic packetships. They 1 ropose to restrict them to one port, in place of three, as suggested by certain companies. The Cour Imp6rlale, after a long deliberation, delivered its judgment in the affair of the Napoleon Docks this 3orning. The sentence of imprisonment against MM. Cusin, Legendre, Ducheane de' Vere, and Berryer, as pronounced by the Tribunal of Premiere Instance, is affirmed; but the fines to which they were condemned are reduced to 3,000f. for Cusin and Legendre, to 2,000f. for Arthur Berryer, and to 1,000f. for Duchesne de Vere. M. Orsi, who was acquitted on the former trial, has been declared guilty of complicity on aocount of his participation in the agreement with Fox and Etenderson, and has been sentenced to three mcnths' imprisonment and 100f. line, and, moreover, to restore 4,400 dock shares. The prisoners are condemned to the costs in diffierent proportions. M. Vieillard, senator, who was tutor to the Emperor louis Napoleon's brother, died this morning at Paris.

The amount of political information to be gathered from the Russian press is just now unusually small; it is never large at any time, but at the approach of spring the whole tension of the State machine, which during the severe cold of vintcr and the presence of the Imperial family and Ministers in the capital had been kept quite taut, slackens rapidly, and little seems to be done during the summer months but to elaborate and carry into execution the measures to which the initiative impulse had been given at a brisker period. The upper classes are just now occupied with their household arrangements, preparatory to going out of town or to setting off on more extended trips abroad, and the navigation has not as yet been open long enough to restore the commercial circles to that state of activity which they are accustomed to exhibit as the season advances. Prince Gortschakoff, the Stadtholder of Poland, is only waiting inSt. Petersburgfor the christeningof thenew-born Imperial Princetoreturn to his post at Warsaw. Prince Menschikoff has already left St. Petersburg, and arrived here, on his way to some German medical spring. Prince Gortachakoff, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is expected before long also to pay this Court a visit, and perhaps to extend his trip further into Germany. The number of persons who will avail them8elves of the recently increased facilities of the passport system to make atrip abroad this summer promtses to be greater than ever, and, as there are people bold enough to assert that this number amounts to 50,000, we may at least assume that it will be an unusually large number. In connexion with this exodus the reflection does not fail to strike both Government and people-both the favourers of the new notions of progress and the votaries of the old Russian system of quiescent stagnation-that every one of these visitors to civilized Europe will return home a more or less active propagator of the new civilization-worship; they will have tasted the sweets of a free press and an unrestrained development of social life and industry, and will, on their return, view the restrictions of the censorahip An2d the home administration with totally different eyes from those they were formerly wont to use. While the Government reckons on gaining here by an increased number of assistants in its 8reat wrork of reform an rognztion, it Xnot blind totihe clmger th^++ AA__ u at the numDber and' ze-al of its assistants may be inconveniently and dangerously powerful for it, and drive it on more rapidly than isjudicious in the path of reform, seeing how sluggish, inert, and corrupt the great bulk of the population ix. All the old Russians solace themselves for this frivolityof their inquisitive gadabout countrymen (as the latter appear to them) with the hope that in proportion M they inform themselves about the arts and manu. factures of foreign countries the better Russia will be able to dispense altogether with the presence of foreigners on her holy soiL The number of enfranchisementa of serfs executed by owners of estates has of lateinereased a good deal. As they are all registered in the office of the Minister of the Interior, and subsequently published in his official periodical, the public has every .facility of observing the progress of this movement. Accord.- ing to the regulations already existing on this subject,theserfs thus enfranchised become free peasants, but are bound to pay a polltai to the Crown. The terms on which the arrangement between them and their owner is made are very far from being too easy. In conformity with the communistic organization of rural life in Russia these compactsof enfranchisement are generally onciuded between a landowner and an entire village or other aggregate community; this latter undertakes in its collective character to pay the landlord a certain sum down, varying according to circumstances; to pay him, and, in some cases, his next heir, an annuity; to take on themselves the debts on 'the estate, and to undertake to pay all the taxes that are at present levied or that may hereafter be imposed on the same. The capacity for undertaking such onerous obligations would Eimpy the existence of rme pecuniary means, and the instances in which thesa arrangements have hitherto tieen made have been for the most part small estate3, on which, in consequence of either careless management or kind indulgence, the serfs have been able to earn and lay by something for themselves, and, on the other liand, the ownera have got so deeply into debt that after paying the interest on their loans and mortgages and the expenses of management, there is little or nothing left for them to live upon. The willingness of these debt-ridden laudowners to part with their estates and Eet themselves traight with the world is on the increase, and it is expectedthat the construction of railroads wil greatlytend to induce others to swell the number since, in consequence of the increased value of the estates that will ensue on their construction, some surplus will accrue to their owners, on which they can live after paying their debts, while at present little or no margin is lef between the amount of their debts and the value of their estates, including the serfs. In fact, there is the same process going on in Russia at the present moment, and voluntarily, as was lately introduced by our Government into Ireland by the Encumbered Estatefi Act. Hitherto the possesion of xheans on the part of the serfs has supplied the estate market with buyers, and superseded the necessity of a legislative act; but when these means are wanting, or the owners are not driven by any motive to sell, some gentle compul sion from without will perhaps be neeary. According to the observations made by intelligent Russians, this compulsion will, however, be rendered superfluous by the eircumstance that the number of noble landlords3will, by the progress of the present movement, eoon become very small, and be confined to the proprietors of enormous estates, free from debt, and that the pressure of public opinion will in the course of time operate so powerfully on this small minority as to make it impossible to hold out in opposition to the general example. A similar process was introduced into Prussi uncder the adninistration of Baron Stein, and has been going on ever since, to the great benefit of the country. The fixed term within which all applications for permission to commute socage tenures for money payments or rents is just now expiring, but will be prclonged by the Government. NAPLES. (J%ox OUR OWN 0o:&RWoWniT.) RAPLES, 3MAY 14. I lately gave 3ou the particulars of a scene aid to have taken place within the Royal Palace. I have taken some trouble to verify the statements, and believe the follownng incidents to be true:-Hlis Royal Highness the Count of Syracuse it is wcU known has always been in advance of his family, and opposed to the system of government adopted in Naples. On several occaions, therefore, he has conceived it to be his duty, according to uni. versal report, to remonstrate with His Maiesty and to tender good counel. His Royal Eighness did so soon after the departure of the British and French Legations, but without effect, as we have long seen. During hisrecent visit to Romagna and Tuscany several incidents occurred, I tan told, which suggested a panffl contrast between Naples and even other Italian States. Thus at Ilorence his Royal Hlihness was invited to attend a meeting of the Polytechnic Association. He did sO, and expressed himself highly pleased. The regulations were the same as those laid down for a similar institution in Naples, but it was insinuated that, whereas in Naples they were not observed i Florence they were well carried out; hence the difference between the two. On his Royal Highnes's retarn to Naples I have been informed that he again spoke to Hlis Majesty on the present system of government. One great subject of remonstrance was the Brindisi or Puglia Railway, which the Count of Syracuse has greatly protected and endeavoured to promote. E nglisih capitl is invested to some amount in it but His Majesty refuses to guarantee any interest on the capital, has declined all propositions made by the Duke Glalliera, and talks of taking it into his owvn hanlds. This would amount, as some think, to a violation at least of an honourable understanding, and to a delay of the construction of the road to the Greek kalends. HisRoyal Highness is stated ts have said that His Majesty would, or might, make a bara,or bier, for himself and hisfamily. Ibelieve,too, that the condition of the political prisoners has engaged the attention of the Count, and that from the first he has been opposed to the plan of sending them off to the territory of the rgentine Confederation. His suggestion has been to send them to England or anywvhere else, according to their respective wishes, providing them with the meanM". f lhing. A few unimportant cases have been urged on the attention of the King by his Royal Highness, and have been favourably received; they are those who were engaged in the Neapolitan expedition which went to Venice in 1848. As may be inferred from what I said above, the case of Poerio and his companions has not been forgotten In the Royal discussions, MiMajesty always deferring their liberation to a more convenient season, andtheCount urgingthat thiactof mercyshould be done voluntarily, and not upon compulsion. As to the constitution, the King will not even listen to the name of it. Hie has learnt to regard it as equivalent to a revolution, and it ll be resisted until revolution becomes a fact. One thing is very clear, that the Royal family are alarmed for their own position, and influenced, it is to be hoped, by a higher principle; and under this impression is it that it has been insinuated to His Majesty that if he will destroy himself he has no right to destroy his family. Indeed, all that I have saidfrom timeto time as to the state of things in Naples would be amply confirmed by those who are near the person of the King,that the laws and institutions of the country are admirable; that, so far from being observed, they are almost a dead letter; that al the various administrations of the kingdomare as corrupt as they can wel be; that no responsibility and no confidence exist; and all are looking to the futurewith an undefinable species of apprehension. Two of the men who were implicated in the murder of Mr. Blandford have been discovered. One has turned evidence against the other, who has a mark over the side of his face, as though from a blow. It is feared, however, that the evidence wiiU be insufficient to produce a conviction. SPATl. (FoR oM x ovw O oN weoisMT.) MADRID, MaY 15. In the Congrens yesterday the Minister of Public Works read two projects of law, one fixing the general bases of a system of public instruction and the other for the completion of the wors in the Puerta del SoL The Spaniish proverb says that in this country things are. begun late and never finished; and of the truth of this saying one is daily reminded. When the works in the Puerta del Sol willbe com.pletd it is very diflicult to say; the probabilities ae that in 20 years hence there wiUl stiU remain something to be done, just as the bullinDg at Seville remains still unfinished, and as in the Plaza Mayor at Madrid (a large square of houses of no very recent emtion) there still remains in one of the sides a gan of six or eight feet. The much talked of works m the Puerta del Sol ae to consist, as you are aware, in the substitution of handsome and lofty houses, disposed in regular form, for the paltry irregular edifices that at present surround this central point of Madrid. Up to the present time all that has been done is to pull down a church and another building, a portion of the materials of which still cumber the ground, and have done so for the last three years The Project originated with the Belgian Count HRme, and with Mr. Edward Manby, one of the well-known English civil engineers. of that name who is now concstruting the railway between Sevile and Cordova, and who has, at various periods, devoted much of his time and of his great skill in his profession to public works in SpaiD. Having conceived the idea, these gentlemen went into the thing with that energy and goodwill by no means uncommon in Engliand and Belgium, but which Spaniards cannot appreciate, and which they are aPt to explain, with their customary suspicion, by the anticipation of some enormous profit, such as it would be a thousand pities any but Spaniards should make. The two projectorx expended a great deal of time, trouble, and money on the ureliminary development of their plan, in eketc hes surveys, estimates, &c. In th a theywere encouraged bythe Government of tbe day, which, without exactly pledging itself, greatly approved the plan, and held out to them hopes that its execution should bwe intrudsed to them. Thus they were induced to go to great expene, and L(which ws veryimportant)they mde arrangements with capitdiats here to find the whole sum required -600,0001. sterling. A lithoaraph exists showing the Puerta del Sol as it would have been whei completed according to their designs, and certainly it would have been a worthy centre to a larger and more important capital than Madrid. Three years would have sufficed to execute the work, by employing a very large number of workmen, so that it wouldnow be nearly completed, had it been begaun when proposed. It was thought proper to put it up to publi competition. Carriquiri, a banker here, acting-I believe there can be no doubt-as the agent of Queen Christina, made a rather more favourable tender than Measrs. Manby and HameL. The object of Queen Christina in desring t6 obtain the concession of the work is matter of conjecture. If it were likely to yield a good profit, that would sufficiently explain it, for it is weU known how eager she is after money; but it has also been supposed that she would have been glad of the opportunitv and pretext it would have afforded to her and her friends of having some thousand labourers and artisans assembled in Madrid in their pay.- This, however, is beside the present question. Perhaps the intention was merely to prevent the work being done at all, and so to discredit the Progresista Government, and to prevent employment being given to a large number of the necesitous classes; perhaps the views of thepersons concerned changed afterthey had obtained the concession; but the fact is, that after paying the first instalment (20,0001.) of the sum to be deposited, they preferred forfeitingit topaying the remainder and proceeding with the work. They are now endeavouring to obtain the retitution of the 20,0001., and it is believed that they will very likely succeed in so doing-on what pretended grounds I knownot, but such transactions are not uncommon in this country, however strange they m.ay appoar to benighted foreigners, who renot yet aware that in many respects Africa begins at the Pyrenees. But, on learning this, the ornginal projectors, whose tender had been rejected m favour of that of Camiquiri, demanded of the Goverament that, if the20,0001. deposit were to be returned to the latter, they should first be paid out of it 30,000 sollars, which they claim for expenses incurred, and time, labour, and prejudice suffered. Notwithstanding the enoouragement given to them by the Government of the day, and which led them into greater expenditure than they otherwise would have thought it prudent to incur, they have never put forward any claim on that score, normade one at alL But the state of the case is entirely altered if the forfeit money is to be restored to the contractors who prevented their getting the concession and then failed to execute the work, and the justice of their present claim appears to me evident and undeniable. In the GazeUe of the 5th instant a Royal order appeared rejecting their demand, but leaving them at liberty to apply to the tribunals for the redress to which they may oonsider themselves entitled. Before Spanish tribunals, however, the chances are decidedly against foreigners, and moreover there may be some difficulty in ascertaining when and if the 20,0001. are refunded, there being various ingenious ways of arranging such cosas de E=pana. Senor Lafragua, the Mexican Envoy, has arrived in Madrid and has had a conference with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I think there is little doubt that the dispute between Mexico and Spain wil be amicably settled. The squadron conveying troops to the Havannah, which left Cadiz last week, returned to port, aud this gave rise to a rumour that the Government had changed its intentions; but the real cause of the return was an accident which happened to the rudder of one of the ships, the Isabel II., she having touched on a rock or come into contact with a sunken wreclk. The accounts from Catalonia are very unfavourable. The warehouses are full of manufactures, which find no sale, and the manufacturers cannot give employment to the workmen. The Duke and Duchess de Montpensier are expected to remain here about three weeks. They will then proceed to England, and in October they wiU again visit Madrid on their way back to Seville.
THE DESTBUCTION OF SALMON. TO THEDITO OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is with very pet satifaction that I seethe salmcn cause taken up so warmly in your pages, and I shall welcome the appeaance of every letter written in earnest on the msbiect, nowever much the writer may differ from me in opinmon, or even if he unwittingly attribute to me motives or circumstances which have no foundation in fact, I should be sory to answer any such wrter in a way calcu. lated to provoke personal controversy which would naturally rest in excluding the argument from your columns Tist indeed, far from being a personal or merely local air. It is a matter of national Importance. It Is a fact that the salmon are perishing from our English rivers. It is an undisputed axiom that they need not so erih; but in order to iure their actal preservation it is desirable that all persons interested (whether from private or publio motives) should unite to inquire dispas. sionately into the caues and effects connected with the sub'ect, ad should not. instead of doinq so, turn round witr shortsighted prejudice to point at individual transgres. sion or imaginary wrong. I have already acknowledged that I do from experience know something on the subject, and that I shall be ready to give any information in my power to a committee appointed for that purpose. To attempt an answer to all comers through the medium of your columns would be too arduous a task for me, even if you would permnit it. Neverthe ess, I must trespass on your indulgence for a few lines in reply to a letter from Mr. John Francis Collier in your impression of yesterday, chiefly because it seems to me he is committing an error, common to all whose knowledge on the subject ia superficial, of fancying he has discovered the only gevane, andin its reformation a panacea for every evil Mr. Collier only requires setting right as to facts. His deduotions would be all right, were not his premises all wrong. He says, " Every fish that Mr. Ayrton takes in the cage at Chester represents 10,000' penks' or ' samlets,' and if he would only open it for one season al fears as to the extirpation of salmon in the Dee might be laid aside." He says that "attention should be turned to the wholesale destruction of the breeding fish in these traps, and of the young fry;" and "it is true thero are certain 'fence dayse inthe latter part of the season-September, I think," &a Now, the fact iP, breeding fih are never taen in Chester cage. The fence days are fromthe 31st of Augaut to the 25th of January in the following year. The gravid fish do not come up the river until late in September, and do not spawn until November and December. As to the young fry, we never see one in the cage. How should we when the bars are 22 inches apart ? ; The fish taken might represent 10,000 young fry If they lived to become gravid fish, but this they are not when we take them ; and, if this is not the time to take them, when is it? for Mr. Collier grants that "fish must be had for consumption." I am, as Mr. Collier states, together with a few other gentlemen, a lessee of Chester cage. We took it with a view to improve the river, and from an impression (perhaps erroneous) that it was improperly and unfairly tished Since that time it has certainly not been ro, and we have been considerable losers by the undertaldng. So far from the cage taking nine out of ever7 ten fish attempting to get up the river, I am satisfied that it does not realize a tithe of the fish taken by the nets of the fishermen below it. To conclude,-are salmon to be taken at all Are they to be sold? Are they to be eaten? If eo, why qparrel with a method which takes them, if properly reglted, only of the proper size and at the r"Xt season? How is it that zivers inr-Scotland and Ireland, i which these fisheries and cage s are used, continue so valuable? Why bave the fish pershed and disappeared from rivers in which no such mea3 for taking them exist? Let Mr. Collier but confine his reprobation to the inm proper useof weis; let him but show that the cage at heater resb under that stigma, and I will at once admit the justice of his remarls Rurther than this, let compensation be granted to the owner of a priv te rigbt, and I w1il heartily concur in the demolition of the Chester cage, without regard to any trifling loes of my own. But, above all thing, let us be careful not to suffer any unfounded prejudice or popular cry to divert us from seeldng means far more important to the preservation of the salmon species-Imea a total revisclof the fshery laws-especiaUy with a view to obtaining more stringent enactments with regard to the spawning fish and young fry; and some such system as the present Irish law, by which the necossary funds are secured for its continued operation. I am. Sir. vour obedient srvnt- _ WILLIAM AYRTOIT. ~un. oec. x6lver see x=lslery. Chestr, May 19.

IAfONBY-AfA2?KBfand The funds opened this morni £t a frezdo-cline of an eighth, but the market showoa mor, steadiness in the afternoon. The first transactions in ConSols for money were at 93g to ;, and there was subsequently a disposition to increased heavi. ness, owing to some large speculative sales which were sid to have been made on account of some of the Greek firms. At a later period, however, there was a slight recovery, and the list official prices were 93V to J for money and 94 to i for the 4th of June. After regular hours there was a renewed declino of an eighth, owing to dull aocounts from the Paris Bourse, but ultimately there were buyers for June at 9L The delay inthe arnivalof the overdue Auj. tralian veasels, coupled with the fact that the agents of the Bank of France are again bidig for gold, checks the firmnes that might otherwise be observable from a general diminution in the demand for money. Bank Stoclk left off at 212 to 21.3i; Reduced, 92Mto i; New TLre rrCents.,92 to i; Indis Stock, 2W20 to 222; In,ia Bonds, 9s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer Bonds, 98g to J; and Exchequer-bills, June, Is. to 3L premium; March, 3. to 6s. premium. The rate for money on short loan in the Stockxchlange to-day was 6k per cent. In the diecount-market and at the Bank there was an absence of pressure. Foreign securities continue to show symptoms of weakness, and they closed with a dull appearance. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 94 and ; and the Four per Cents Guaranteed, for money, at 1011. The other operations oomprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 99k; Danish Three per Cents., 8 ; the Five per Cents., 101 and 101I; Mexican, for the account, 22k; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 63=; Portuguese Three per Cents,, for account, 4D , Russian Five per Cents., 106; Sardinian Five per Cents., for money, 91S, J, and , ; for the acecount, 92; SpaniUh Three per Cenii., for account, 41; Venezuela, for the account, 35; Dateh Twoand-a-Half per Centa., 65; and the Four per Cents Certificates, 97j and 97. The corn-market was steady this morning, at the decline of Monday. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. for both money andaccount, showing a further fall of a quarter per cent. Another development in connexion with the speculative mania in Paris has taken place. The stoppage of M. Charles Thurneymen, a banker and sharedealer,with debts variously stated at an amount equal to from 800,0001. to 1,000,0001., has just ben communicated, and also his departure for Amerxca. The chief sufferers, it appea, consist of persons who had deposited money and securities in his hands, some of the principal Polish families resident in Paris having trusted him with extraordinary amounts. One instance of the kind is alleged in which the sum is more than 300,0001. It is said that M. Thurneyrsen left Paris en route to the United States on Thursday evening last and it is consequently inferred that he sailed Ly the Arabia, which left Liverpool on Saturday. M. Thurneyssen is a nephew of the well-known banker of the same name, who is one of the promoters of the Rusian Railway Company. His family is also nearly connected with that of M. isaac Pereire, and it was probably from the influence of t'hese circumstances that he contrived to acquire his credit. It was exactly at this time last year that the failure of M. Place, one of the directors of the Cr6dit Mobilier, was announced on the Bourse, also for 800,0001.; and, looking at the facts in both cases, the question is unavoidably suggested as to how far the unsoundness at this moment extends. The cause for surprise is the magnitude of the liabilities that can thus be contracted without engendering notice or suspiclon. Not a fortnight has elapsed since the Crddit Mobilier affirmed that its position was that of a sentinel over the healthy development of French enterprise. Are its directors stil certain that they are competent to the functions they have assumed? Purchases of 5 franc pieces are being made for shipment to India. They arrive chiefly from Belgium. Meanwhile the silver-market does not show any increased activity. As the silk crop proceeds without the announcement of any very discouraging symptoms, conjectures arise in some quarters that the remittances to China may have been overdone, although the demand for sugar and other produce from ManiLla and Singapore may still keep up an adverse rate of eschange in those regions. The West India steamer Parana, which may be looked for about the 1st of June, is ex- pectedbtobring more than 500,0001. in silver and gOIa.~ ~ ~ ~ ~~O According to the treaty just concluded with DenmaTk forthe redemption of the Sound Dues, the sum to be pald by England is1,125,2061. The aggregate from all countries will be 3,890,0001., Great Britain being the first onthe list, Russiasecond, andPrussia third. All the other totals are insignifcant, excepting those of Sweden and Norway and France. Subjoined are the States which have entered into the convention, and the respective amounta they have engaged to contribute :- Great Britain ... ... ... 4125,206 Austia ... ... ... .. 3,270 Belgi ...... .m . ... .. . *-- 33,497 Bremen. . 24,283 raInc. . 135,431 Hamburg. 118 Hanover. ... ... ... 13,710 Lubeck ... ... ... ... ... 10,333 Medldenburg . .. 41,518 Norway. ... ... ... ... 74136 Oldenburg ... ... 312 Ntherlunds ... ... .156,451 Prussiaa ... ... ... ... 493336 Russa ... ... ... ... 1, 082,221 Sweden ... ... ... . . 176,722 £3,385,132) The remaining 500,0001. will comprise a number of small amounts from countries whlch were not represented in the convention. The two largest items among these will be America, 79,0001., and Brazil, 56,0001. According to one article of the contract the several Powers are to have the option of immediately paying in full, orof spreading the disbursement over 20 years in equal half-yearly instalments, with interest, which appears to be contemplated at 4per cent. From the special arrangement with Eqngland, however, it seems that the sum is to be paid"vwithin three months after the requisite Act shall have been passed by Parliament." The collection of the Sound Dues ceased on the 1st of last month, and on the previous day a memorial was presented to the Danish Government for compensation to the 35 agency firms at Elsinore who have hitherto devoted themselves to this business. Acting between the Government officials and the shipowners and consignors liable for the dues, their services have been of equal value to both partial, and, as they went into the occupation in the belief that the title of the Danish Government to the dues being indefasible and perpetual no change would occur to affect their position, their cae now appears hard, and will, it may be asumed, receive favourable consideration. The Derwentwater has arrived from Hobart Town, but she is not believed to have brought any gold. The death of Mr. James Freshield, jun., the solicitor to the Bank of England, was announced to-day, after a short illnees. His lom will be deeply felt among 2al commercial intareIt lt appears that the dividends paid on the estate of Messr Reid, Irying, and Co. have amounted to 2s. 6d. in the pound, instead of is. 6d., as stated yesterday. In addition to the further sum of 6d. in the pound, now declared, it is hoped there will yet be considerable realizations.

TIE COTTON QUZSTTIOf. TO THE EDITOR OF TRE TImm. Sir,-The clear and comprehensive view taken of the broad principles of this question in your leading article of the 16th int. does not seem to shut out the coneideration of the queetion in more detail. In the share which I took in the discusion of the subject at the Society of Arta, on the 13th inst., I restrieWd myself cIosely to the practical poimts, which an examination of the question through a period of upwards of 70 years enabled me to exhibit with tolerable clearness; showing the progress in the export of cotton from the United States and theretrogreesion in the suppLes from other countries. The numbers mentioned in my examination of the advanoe in Americaa supplies, shown In seven eriods of five years eachb could no; fail to be somewrhat striidng. The first quinquennia period, 1821 to 1825, showed 76Z000,O0lb. of cottoni exported from Amcrica. Tho second period gave an increase of 50,000,0001h. over the first; the third 400O,000OOOlb. over the second; the fourth I,000,000,000ib. over the third; the fifth again, 1,000,000,000Th. over the fourth; the sixth was quite sationary, tling in the years 1846 to 1850. How far that halt was attributable to the commercial changes of 1846, it is, perhapS, not necemwy now to inquire; but it was amply made up by the advance in the seventh and last period, 1851 to 1855, the export being 5,128,000,0001b., or 1,500,000,000Th in excess of the two preceding periods. The pro. portion taken by us, as compared with tht to all other countries, maintained throughout a Tery uniform rate, not baying been higher iu the whole 35 years than 74 per oeut., nor lower than 67 per cent, of the entire quantity; the average of the whole term being 69 per oent. The figures given ln the journalof the society show this clearly; but they prove, also, that however rapid was our own progress that of other countries went on in the same ratio. Of the 5,128,00,0001b.exported from Americain the last five years, we took3,424,000,000Db.,and othercountries3,704,000,0001b. being respectively two-thirds and one-third of the whole quantity. And, although -in those five years we imported from other countIies than America 837,000,000lb., we also exported to the continent 619,000,00Dlb.; thus '^aving our total supply 218,000,0001b. above the quaatity received from America alone. But if we look at this ques. tion with reference to the power given to other countries to compete with us In the fully manufactured goods we must take into account the quantity of yarn that -we supply theiu with, which was 749,000,0001b., equivalent to S20,000,0001b. of cotton. And, however anxious we must be as English. mento see our country outrival the rest of the world, we must in common prudence not shut our eyes to the actual progress of other nations. Onr relative position, then, will Emtad in the last five years-so far as regards cotton converted into manufactured goods-as follows ib.

CAO,C,00 It shows that the total weight of cotton worked up into goods abroad wa 4.. ,2961000.0ec being exacly 0 per cent. more than the aggregate of our manufacture. Now, when we consider that very nearly the whole extent of thi foreign manufacture has grown up since the yer of the General Peace in 1815, we are, I think, bound to watch, with something of anxiety, our own progress, large as it ray be. In my remarks at the Society of Arig I stated that .the export in the 35 yeas, 1821 to li55, of manufactured goods wAs to the value of 598,00,0DO. sterling; and without naming any sum, I sAid that "the value of the manUI factured goods consumed at home would fail little, if at all, short of the value exported," To that statement I adhere, or, I should rather say, that I undervalued the ome consumption. About 20 years ago I wade a careful estimate of the respective amounts of export and home conumption in cotton-mU ufactred goods. and I found that, from the year of the peace to that period, the avera4e of home consumption exceeded, bymany millions sterling annuaUy, the uve exported; and it in only within the list hal-dozen years that the export has exceeded in value the home consumption. The value of cotton-manufKCtured goodg consumed in this country in the last 35 years mav be very safely taken at an average of 2O,O.00 .ter&Sg erannum, or 700,000,LOO&forthewhol, term, being above 100,000,000. sterling in exoes of the ex. port; and makbing with the value so rtd the amout of 1,V9M,000,000Z. sterling, as the entire value of the mnutfacture, exclusive of the yarn exported, being 194,000,O000. sterling;constituting an aggregate close upon 1,500,000,0C0. sterling. But I have always beld yarn exported to be pro. ductive to the country in a ttiflinig degree, compared with the advantage yielded by the perfcted manuactue, These facts do not affect the question of the importauoe of additional supplies of cotton firom the EAst Indiee or other oDuntrie, British Guiana for instnce. Assuming that the question *f additional labour can be decided im favour of the West Indies, the advaut&getoourtrade wi1 be considerable, and for this simple rrawon :-The great bulk of the Anerican cotton, and stilllesmEat India cotton, is not of theouality equird for obtning the finet yarns -pun; Sea Isand, or oter cotton approaching it inquality isessentil to thatobject Now, notwithstanding the inmemeenergli nerea e in the expot of eotto fromw the Unitedtate in the 35 yer I have aMzed, that of the fins SealslandquLlitywas stationary.

ULSTER. A special meeting of this company was held on Monday at Belfast, Mr. W. Coates in the chair. The meeting was called for the purpose of empowering the directors to reissue 1,617 forfeited shares, so as to make up the original capital of the company. A circular was issued to each shareholder stating that an allotmont would be made to the shareholders, at 55W. a-share, in proportion to their holding, uhether of the old or extension shares, one of the old being equal to two of the latter. The CHAIRMAN said it would be seen by the last half. yearly statement that the capital was overspent by about 37, 0001. Since then other items had raised it up to about 40,0001., and a considerable sum was now required for the extension of the Belfast station. For these reasons the directors thought it was better to raise the money by the forfeited shares than in any other way. There wero 134 proprietors who bad given no answer to the circular. After a brief discussion, reeolutions were adopted to tho effect that the scheme proposed by the board for the disposal of the 1,617 forfeited shares in the company be approved, authorizing the directors to take the necessary measures for carrying the proposition into full effect and operation, and requesting the directors, in case any of the forfeited shares should be unappropriated, to dispose of them as they may deem most advisable for the benefit of the company. The meeting then separated. TRAFFIC RETURNS. Miles Pea- 35er Total, Total, Bawams op sen. ees. handise. 1857. 18$6. Week ending May 9.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, EBu7igU-shvA , May 2D. IN RE JA3M STEVEM. TRTPP_ (Before Mr. CoDminM. RAT. A 7- I Lne banicrupt was a stock and share broker, of Lombard. street-chambers, Clement's-lahe. It appears from the pro. ceedings that this is his second bankruptcy. The aooounts under the first bankuptcy extend from July, 1845, to Ocober 1850. They show that prior to the former penod the bantUpt had ha losses to the extent of 78,0401. 2s. 7d, in the share-mrket, and was ina deficiency of 66,972.Os. 4d.- He continued? however, with this deficiencytrading to 1850, when is unsecured debts were58M505 _.3d., *nd% ass3ts only 24 His house and personal expenses during the 5i years were 4,095L, exclusive of travelling expenses (6501) The present bruptcy is on thQ bankrupts own petition His accounts extend from Febry 1,1854, to Jiarch 31, 1857. They commence with a deficiency of 104. and cose with the follomng items-unsecured creditors (including clergymen and other residentain various pats of te country), 15,0664; creditors holding security, 3,850; profits, 19, 664.; losses, 27,4751., including 25,7521 on mining, rail way, and other shares, and 692G on realization of house hold and offloe furniture. The domestic expenses are put down at 4,6630; the trade expenses at 4,0241, inciading a considerable suim for advertising. The bankrupt's assets are merely nominaL This was the examination meeting. Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees, Mr. Bagley for creditors, afj Hr. Lucas for the bankrupt. Mr. BAGLPY said he should have some serious cases of complaint to make against the bankrupt on a future occasion. Atpr_senthewonldconfine his oppositiontoanexamination of the bankrupt in respect to two transactions. The bankrupt, examined, said he netitioned this Court in Febrary last as an arnging debtor. Twelve months previouly he had simlarly petitioned the Conrt as an arrangng debtor, when it was agreed to give him time and a oetter of license. He kept books, including ledger and cashbook, also a book "with men on the market," and with prindpals. On the 28th of January, 1857, he received from Mr. W. EL Parldn, of Yeovil, 3461 It was sent to him in payment of 1,000. stock in the Manchester, Sheffield, and Linooln Railway. Mr. Parkin was debited with the stock on the 26th of January, and the stock was to be delivered to him on the 30th of January. From first to last he (bankrupt) had never had that stock. He promised it, but on the 2th there was avery heavy account, and he never did buy it. He had written a letter, of which the following is a copy;- *' London, Feb. 18, 1857. Dear Sir.-We are exceedingly sossy tWet we bave no' been able to deiver lont stock before, but we shaLL donbtle,s have It completed this week. Theo tansfer we shall have to forward for your niguature before it can be registered. "We are, dear Sir, yen,, hfn "J.a88.TIPP and Co.' This followed a letter of which the following is a copy:- " London, BeN. 14. "Der Sir,-The Dsty who has to deliver us your shar In not in town to-day, bet we wsi prem him on M!onday for Immediste delivery, "-oW. H. aea aur, s faithtflly, J. S. TRIPP sad o. Examination continned,-The letter containing the passage, *' The party who is to deliver us your shates is not in town to-day Iwas an excuse to obtain time-a mere fiction. He got into difficulties on the account-day, and was prevented from purchasing the stock. He had received from the Rev. Abraham Le Sueur, of Grouville Rectory, Jersy a snm of 4821 He had written to Mr. La Sueur advising him of the purchase of some South Caradon. Mining share. The shares had not, in fact, been purchased, but they were in negotiation for the purchase. They had purchased some Great Wheal Alfred shares. Mr. La Sueur had been debited in his books and in an account with these shares, as also with the Caradon shares, although the latter had never been bought.A Mr. BAGL.-There are a great many tramsactions of a similar character. I do not consider it necessary, however, to go into them to-day. Upon the evidence already given I have to ask that the bankrpt's examinAtion may be adjourned sine die and protection refused. Mr. LucAs objected. Mr. Commissioner Holroyd had decided that protection could be withhelda. this early stae of the proceedings only where there had been false entries or mutilation of books. The point urged against the bank rapt was one of conduok and must beirXed at the certificate meeting. It was a well-known practice on the StockExchange ror brokers to sell that which they had not bought. After the sale they went into the market. Stockbrokers always waited for the turn of the market. The CommlsaSowm-The turn inthe course of the day. Did Mr. Holroyd rule that to enter in a book that which was not true was not a false entry? Where a false entry is made, representing a transaction as having taken plaeI which really did not take place, I shall hold it to be suffi. cient. Mr. LucAs urged the custom of trade on the StockExchange. The ComaIssioNum.-I don't care much about custom, particularly when it is a bad custom. Mr. BoArxy referred to the bankrupt's letter of the 26th of January to Mr. Parkin, in which he writes:-" There are several orders in town for the purchasing of Manchester, Sheffield, andLincoln stock, and it has been impossible to purchase under 34J. We accordingly debityon uwith 1,0001. stock at 34-3421. O1s.; commission, 21. 10s.; stamp, 1.15S." Even the commission andstamp werechared sathough the bankrupt acknowledged to-day that he had not bought the stock. The bankrupt contended there was no false entry. The entry was one of the sale of the stock, and he had sold it. There was no entry of the purchase. Re examined.-Mr. Le aucur had been debited with the Caradon Mining shares, although he never had them. After he got into difficulties Mr. .Le Suenr's solicitor had caled upon him and consented to receive payment at three, si, anud 12 months. M9r. La Sueur had, in fact, resold the shares.~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~m reod h The Coverrad9owm-How could he resell shares that he never had? Mr. Le Saeur's solicitor here remarked that the bankrut's statement was false from beginning to end. . LucAs again urged the practice of the Stock-Exchange. The CoasSsoxzoP. said if he were to find the practice was that of 19-20ths of the members of the Stook-Exchan e (but he doubted if it was), he should still hold it to be within the statute. It was a convenient way of getting money and paying nothing for it. The custom mighthbe very good in Capel- court, but it was very bad in Basinghallstreet. He held the case to be clearly one of making false entries with intent to conceal the true state of affairs. Entries in books must be more inaccordance with truth. He should-adjourn the bankrupt's examination sine die, Protection would be granted for a short period, to give the bankrupt an opportunity to appeal. (Before Mir. Commuoner GouLURLN.) lR BE B. H. BOLLrN. The bankrupt was an innkeeper, of King's Lynn. .Mr. LLmxLATER, for the assignees, called attention to the leading features of the case. His HoNouB said the bankrupt had successively followed the avocations of coach propnetor, innkeeper, and hotel manager. Biswaccounts commenced with a deficiency of 5001., and, after a lapse of two years, closedcwith debts 1,7901., and assets about la 6d. or 2s. in the pound. The trading had been improvident and otherwise unfavourable. A third-class certifcate after imonths' suspension with protection would meet the justice of the casa, Certilicate accordingly.
INSOLVE2VT DEBTOBS COUBT, Maay 20. IN RE RICHARn HyTn -PA Rrn-.cq (Before ahe CHIEF Co-rISSToxv) This insolvent, a farmerand licensed victualler, at Theale, in Berkshire, appeared for adjudication. Mr. Nichols opposed, and Mr. Reed supported. The complaint was that the insolvent had contracted a debt exceeding 501 with a Mfr. Gilchrist, without any reasonable expectation of payment. It appeared that he bought cattle of the opposing creditor, in phyment for which he gave abill of exchauge for 300. Shortly before the bill became due, in August laat, the insolvent induced Mr. Gilchrist tolet him have other cattle of the value of nearly 250L, representing that the bill would certanly be paid at maturity. That representation was not verified, and soon after the insolvent left The.le and came up to London, where he was arrested. The CEmaF CossrmssoNzR was of opinion that the debt of Mr. Gilchrist had been incurred without reasonable expectations of payment The other creditors in the schedule a dreasonto complain of the insolvent's conduct, and he therefore would not be discharged from Mr. Gilchist'a suit until the lapse of ten montbs from the vesting order, and from the suit of the creditors generally until he had been in prison for three months (concurrently with tho other judgment). IN RE JACOB WlrrITZ. This insolvent was opposed by Mr. WAY, on belhalf of a creditor, 'who, at the suggestion of the parisah authorities, had sued the insolvent for penalties for permitting dancing and music in his beershop, at ShadweTh Upon a former occasion the insolvent refused to pledge himself to abate the nuisance, and the Court declined to adjudicate. It appeared now that the insolvent had discontinued the obeoctionable proceedngs, and had given up the house Mr. WIY asked for a remand, in order to prevent a renewal of the nuisance. The Cmxv Comnssro9sxiB ordered the insolvent to be discharged uon the expiration of te weeks from the vesting order-a lu4ment which prologs the impsisormat for

Mr. Sleigh appeared for the appelant; Mr. Poland in support of the conviction. she appellant, a young man of exoellent moral character, as deposed to by a number of witnesses, was a servant in the establishment of a family of title, and such was the good o,pinion entertained of him that he was allowed to retain his sstuation PEsnding this appeaL That which led to the charge being preerd occurred in Kensington-gardens on the 7th of Mdarch in the dusk of the evening, and it was now urged that upon the evidenoe the Court could not come to ihe conclusion that his intention was to insult any one. the COnILT considered the evidence insufficient to support he conntion, and ordered it to be quashed. Au us Prederick Daniel and William Gray were indic for having asaulted Joseph Skinner. Mr. SLEGH appeared for the defendants, and asked the prosecutor if he mtended to have the case tried. The Prosector wished the defendants to plead guilty. Mr. SLEIGH said he could tiot permit anything of the kind. The defendant Daniel had been well-nigh ruined by the conduct of the proseCutor,who had got possesion of a house to which he had no title or right, and had pleaded pultY to an indictmint for forcible entry upon the premises mn question. An actionx of trespeas had been brought aginst himi, in which the pIlaitiff recovered a verdict, wit, 501, damages.; but not a shilg, had been paid; and this in. dictnent had been pending dnce Octobcer last, all arising out of Skinner's conduct. The prosecutor having aid le should rtoffer any evi. denco, disolaiming vindictiveness, A verdict of Not GuiUy was taken, and the defendants were discharged. Ellen Wilson, 30, was Indicted for having stolen a number of silver and other articles of the value of 30Z., the vroPerty of Georgo Chappell Potts, her master, in his Mr. F. E. Lewis appeared for the prosecution,; Mr. Ribs ton defended the prisoner. The circumstanoes of this caae were involved in a gooD deal ofmystery. It appeared that the prisoner was the widow of a soldier whe was dlled in the Crimea, and was In the receipt of an allowance of 13L a-year from the War Depertment, and for some time she had been in the service Of Mr. Pots, cooper, 516, Neow Oxford-streot, but she did not sleep upon the premises. She was lodging in Hanvwaystreet, passing as the wifo of a young man named Wilson and one day on going home she told him that she had for gotten to lock the coalcellar of Mr. Potts premises, and asked him to take the key ana go to the houso and lock the door. He did so, and on descending the kitchen stairs he found at the bottom a bed and bolster rolod up, and on opening them he saw they contained a silver teapot and a. vaiety of other articles packed up redyfor emovel. Being satisfied that a robbery had been committed, he procured theaeidofaperson named Butler, the prosecutor being absert at the time, and went into the drawing-room, which theyfound all in confusion. The drawers of a sideboard had been broken open and ransacked, and the lid of a cashbox wrenched off and the contents gone. They then went for the prowecutor, and, ho having arrived, a further search was made, and m tho idtehen fireplace they found the tragments of a small box which had been broken up and thrown into the fire, and in the boiler-of the kitshen range they found a parcel containg silver spoons, a sugar basin, and other articles-of plate. Other articles which had been taken from the un-stairs room were found conceaed in out-of-the-wa plas and -the glaes of a cruet frame which had been broken up with a hammer were picked up on a dust-heap. TBe prosecutor then went to the prisoner's lodging with a policeman, and on searching there they found some antique china cups and saucers and a prayer. book, whicl- he identified as his property. The prisoner had In her possesion a bex oontining 11 sovereipns, five of which were quite bright and new, and five soveregns of that description had been abstracted from the prosecutor's cashbox. She was then given in charge, and on being searched at the station-house the searcher fancied she had somethbig in her mouth, and asked her what it was, She at first replied, "Nothing," but, on the searcher telling her to open her mouth, she said she had got a rina and a she was spealdng it fell from her mouth. She said it was one which her husband had given her, but from a peculiar bend in it, and something on the edge, it was iden. tifed, although but an ordinary wedding ring, as one which had been given to Mr Potts in 1853, on the death of an aunt to whom it had belonged. The prisoner had one wedding ring on her finger, but she said sbe bad always worn two rings since she had lived with Wilson. The prisoner was not the only person who had access to the place, and the suggestion was that some one else committed the theft, and was disturbed before the property could be carried away. The prisoner accounted for the possession of the five bright sovereigns by stating that she always received her peioa in new v old, and that she was very savins, which seemed to he the fact, for she had a savings. bank account of abt 201. in her owvn name. The ring was taken from the caahbor. Mr. RenroN addressed the jury at some length, and urged that, if the prisoner had committed the theft, it was most remarkablethat she should have sent Wilson to the house to discover it, and that she did not carry away the property, particularly the smaller articles of plate. The prayer-book and cups shebad only ta^ken for temporary use. The real charge wa the stealing of the plate, and thero ws nothing in te evidenco, he. sbmitted, to justify the assumptxonthatshehaclanyhbancinit; or, at least, there was so much doubt in the ease that the prsoner ought not to be convicted, The ASSISTANT-JUDGE having summed up, The juzyrelird. aad after being absent half-an-hour they agreed, and found the prisaner Guilty of the larceny of the prayer-book and cups and saucers, mr. RIBTox said that was tantamount to an acquittal upon the more serious part of tho charge. The ASSISTANT-JUDGE sald that it was so. He showld defer the sentence for the present. Several boys, who had durng the session been convicted of larceny from the person, were brought up and senteneed to short terms of imprisonment, and to be detained in reformatory institutions for longer periods.
POLICE. GUIDIM)An.-The lnvesigation of the charge of conspiracy against May. Taylor, and Myers was yesterday resumed, when some very importaut disclosures were made, but as the case was adjourned at the close of the evidence we reserve our report until the judgment is given, Alderman HuarRsx having intimated that the case was of too serious a character for him to jump hastily to a conclusion. Bow-srREET.-Daniel Lynob, a shoemaker, living in Great Wild-street, Drary-lane, was brought up on remand charged with an aggravated assault upon Ellen Lynch, his wife. It appeared that on the night of thel2th inst. the prisoner came home draunk after 12 o'clock at night. His wife was in bed. le asked one of the children if there was any tea for him, and she replied that there was not. He then flew intoa passion, and, spiringing upon his wire, dragged her from the bed by the hair of her head and beat and kicked her as she lay on the ground. A woman who lodged in an adjoining room fetched a policeman, but before he arrived the complainant had escaped from the prisoner, and had run out into the street in her night dress. She was bleeding rzofily from the month and nose, and her face was much ,Miignred by blows. Prom the testimony of the neighbours it appeared that the wife was a very sober, decent woman, and that the prisoner was in the habit of getting drunk and ill-using her The complainant said he t her pretty nearly as much when he was sober as when he was drunk. She had brought himbeforethemagistrates severaltimes,and on the last occasion he had been held to bail, but as soon as the timo was out he becarne as bad as ever.

Mr. Herring was for the defendants. Superintendent Hannant, C division, having exhibited the nsual authority from the Police Commissioners, said he went to the defendant's house about 9 o'clock-, with Inspector Webb and several constables. He went into the parlour, and found the landlord. East, sitting at a table, with a list before him relating to races, and another list, on which were the names of persons and horses with a statement of odds. The other defendant6 were inthe parlour. On searching the place he found a large quantity of betting cards, as well as several books containinz entries of bets. On East was found about 60L in gold and silver. Inspector Webb corroborated the above evidence. Poice-constable Draper, A 326, proved that he paid visits twice to the hecse, and on eactL occasion saw bets made with East. Mr. Herring wonld not struggle against the evidence brought forward, and after addressng the Court in mitigation, Mr. BEAnOIT fined East 301., or two months, and discharged all the other defendants.

.IL]i'RY AND NiA VAL 4X TELLIgRNCIL Tho Adventnu 3and Assist'.co, iron steam troop ships,| mbsrired their repective allotments of troops for Chia ye:srday at PortsmO',th; these consisted of seven com. I panies of the 824 1.gment in the Assistance, and three Companies of tfao same and three companies of the 23d 'RoyadWcelto Pusileers in the Adventure. The arrange. ments of the embarcation were very good, and they were tffected under the saperintendenOe of Major-General B;e. ton, commanding the south-west district; Lieutenant-Colo. nel Wright, asistant-quartermaster-general; and Major Nelson, Brigade-Major. Everything connected with the equipment and the victualing and berthing of the troops was efficiently provided for, and there is every prospect of their being comfortable on board. We regret, however, to report very differently of the conduct of the men of the 82d prior to going on board. Some 200 or 300 of them were rioting all night on the eve of embarcation, and yesterday morning also. Portsea was kept in a constant state of commotion. The men got drunk and were dis'orderly, broke windows, and insulted those they fell in with most dis- gracefully, and one man crowned his feats by participating in a burglary, and was yesterday noon committed by the Portsmouth justices to take his trial at Winchester for that crime. The seone at the dockyard yesterday baffles a correct description; the men were picked up by strong pickets, and got into cabs and omnibuses in default ,of being able to use their legs, and were so taken to the dockyard jetty, where some were landed in a helpless state. They were to have embarked about 1 o'dock, but they were not on board by 5. The folowing are the officers who embarked:-In the Assistanme-Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Robertson, commanding the 82d; Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel D. Watson; Major C. T. V. B. Isaac; Captains H. C. Marriott, S. P. Jervis, W. P. yarmar, 1. Gordon, S. Slater, T. B. Green, and H, C.

One ield officer, three captains, seven subalterns, one staff, 1;5 sergeants, 12 corporals, 5 drumners, and 201 privates of the 234 Royal Welsa Fasileers olse embarked yesterday in the Adventure. The following were the officers :-Lientenant-Colonel Pratt; Brevet-Major H. D. Torrens& Captains J. C. Jervoise and C. G. Norton; Lieutenants . Monsell, R Utterson, J. E. Henderson, and F. Hutton; Ensigns J. H. Walwyn, C. 3. Wrench, and HL J. Richards; Assiatant-Surgeoi H. F. Sylvester. The Swedish corvette Lsgerbjelke, 18, Captain Bratt, from St. Thomas's, for Stockholm, put in at Spithead yesterday, and exchanged salutes with the Port-Admiral and Lieutenant-Governor; after which Captain Bratt landed, and was presented to the naval and military authorities by the acting Swedish consuL The officers of the ship wiU land to-day and inspect the dockyard, and she wiU sail this .eveniDg for Stockbolm. It is reported that Colonel Marcus Slade, formerly of the !90th Regiment, has been appointed to the command of a bigade in Dablin garrison, in saccession to Major-General zitranbenree, who is about to proceed to China. Rear-Admiral Sir Maurice Berkeley, Rear-Admiral Henry Eden, and Sir Baldwin Walker, Sarveyor of the Navy, went down to Woolwich Dockyard yesterday morning, where they embarked on boark the Admiralty yacht Black Eagle, and proceeded down the river to visit the American steamship Niagara. The freightship 1arl of Mar anld Kellie has taken up her xaoorings at Woolwich pier to ship engineers' stores for Hongkong. The freightship Sydney Hal has arrived off Woolwich Arsenal from the docks for the Purpose of embarking ammunition for Cape Coast Castle and( Gambia. Her MaNesty's screw steam sloop Brisk, 16, Commander Alfred J. 'urtis, from the Pacific, arrived at Plymouth on Tuesday. She sailed from Valparaiso, January 21, arrived at the Falkland Islands Febraary 18, and left on the 23d. The screw steam corvette SateUite, 21, Captain James C. Prevost, having in tow the sloop Siren, 16, Commander Jasper H. Selwyn, had left with Governor Moore for the missionary settlement at Keppel's Island, off the coast of Pata"onia. The corvette would proceed round the Horn; the brig would return to Falkland with the Governor. The Brisk crossed the line on the 5th of April, ant on the 23d in lat. 21 10 N., long. 40 32 W., spoke a French paset, a bark, with the letters "T. B." on her fore topnail. She has brought irom the Falklands some beautifal wild geese, natives of the islands, for Admiral Bowles. The Brisk was commissioned 25'h of May, 1853, by Captain Seymour, who was succeeded 20th of October, 18.51, 'by her present commander. Her services have been of a varied character. She went first to the White Sea, and thence to the West Indies; she then proceeded into the Pacific and inspected the Russian military settlement of Petropaulovaki, from which sbe sailed for the coast of Mexico, where she was employed collectiug freight. Her final duties were those of protecting British propertv in Central America, occasionally sisiting the Gulf of Nicoya, the Bay of Costa Rica, &c. During the last 311 days she has only been 41 in harbour. Her crew are in good health. During the four years of her commission sbe has lost only five men from disease. The Brisk wiU probably be paid off at Plymouth.
THE SLAVE TRADE. TO TIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the announcement which appeared in your columns this morning of the arrival of the Wesb Indian mail the foUowing passages occur:- " There is no news (from Jamaica) of any importance whatever. The ohief topic in the papers is the capture of the slaveship, of which inteligence has already been received in England." Can it be, Sir, that to the people of England the particulars of the capture of a slaver now afford no information of importance? Isit nonewstothe hertsofEngliahmen tohearthat .380 human beings have been rescued from helpless misery and degradation? This cannot be the case, and I feel asanred that the words I have quoted were written hurriedly by your correspondent, and that you wiU gladly give publicity to some few facts revealed by tbis, from 'which many wiU be led not only to rejoice in the liberation of the captives, but also to raise a tribute of thanksgiving at the transfer of so large a number of immortal souls from the dark dismal swamp of heathenism into a land iunminated by gospel light. I have received several communications from Jamaica, including a letter signed by the Rev. James Watson, a Pres byterian minister, and two other gentlemen of considerable position, in which they vouch the correctness of the information suppliod. I regret that the length of this comnnunieation precludes the hops of your being able to insert it at length, and I have cuUed the foUowing statement from its 4ontents:- The slav vwas a schooner of only 150 tons, name and nation coecealed, though clearly of American build. When the vessel was captured there were 380 slaves on board huddled together naked as they were born. There was not zoomfor them to lie down, and they sat upon their haunches 1n rows, packed one between the legs of another, between the hold and the deck, on boards placed over water -casks, without light or air but from the hatchway. If they moved the poor creatures literally rolled over one another, being packed as thick as they could sit from stem to nearly the stern of the vessel. Between the bare boards on which they were placed and the main deok the height was only 3S feet. Five hundred human beings were jammed into this horrible hole, though it is beyond aU comprehension how they were thus stowed away. The filth and stench, aye, And the mass of vermin, were indescribable; and can we wonder that 120 of the suffdrers died (shaU I not say were murdered?) on the passage? Twenty more expired under the Britbh flag, bat before they could be landed on British eoiL Of those landed in Jamaica about 300 are boys, and there =re 40 girls, aU ranging from 14 to 20 years of age. Of old 2nen and women there were none. The cabin of the vessel is about six feet square, formed by a thin bulkhead, and so small that no one can stand upright Into this foul den of the captxin were stowed the 40 naked girls, that monster himself and the mate sleeping by turns in the same horrible state. Sleeping did I say? 7Vould that -t had been so ! This man (the captain) who is only about 30 years of age, stated that-he-had been engaged in the trade for aceonsiderable period, and had many successful voyages, so that, although yns personal loss on this occasion would amnount to nearly $75SQ00, lhe should stiU have abundant neans. This admis-isn adds confirmatory proof, if it were wanting, that the slar4-tradeis as brisk rs ever, andthatagitation, hearty action, on the part of the British people is as necessary at this tiuue as at any former period, if this foul and abominable crime is to be suppressed. In conclusion, I would quote the language of one of the sveakers at a meetiLg lately held in the city of JXiagston on this subject --" The giving of liberty to the captive was Britain's glory, her honour, Jeer moral grandeur Then she looked on the production of the 31ave with ahorrence; su4ar appeared as tainted with blood. But, Six, the obange ror the worse has succeeded. The love of cheap zagar has thrown deformity over that eolhdo figure, blinded that qltzr eye, Riven a manterisi ,coprswess to the whole featnse, nd ifilled that heart with coarse calculation of coin, instead of heroic pulsation ,or the emancipation of the slave. The cheapness of sugar geenis to lave reconciled Britain to her culpable negligence f ;otguilty connivance. In all herbistory 1 know nothing siiketDiS;*h4or honour is tarnished, aer word broken, and &unmarity is disappointed. Until the slave treaties are enforced there hangs upon Us the cloud of national goit. lwan2ity in gen>er.al, and the slwve in parlioular, wvas our client, and by the mnost soleman conventions we said we would at r,s the patron /and the friend. A men's word is no trifle; a nation's soinusa vow is indeed a solemmu thing." I remain. Sir. vour-obedient servant. LEONARD ROWE VALPVY. p, riPrnggardeos, May 18.

BUDDrIS&T, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Rudibras sloes not give ;anch encouragement in his pithy distich of- " These who in qirreks interpose "Are wont to get'a%Ioody nose" te znix oneself np with strife, whether physical, moral, or lIterary; nevertheless, oute olui co^de, as I have for many years past taken a geod deal of interest in the Buddhist subject indispute betwesn your reviewer and Mr. Barhamindeed, discussed the matter at length in my Notes on Ancient 'sia-I must Esy a few words, although they will not altogether harmonize with the opinions of either party. And, -frst, both are prefessing to argae npon' the religious tenets of Buddhism, butn instead of going to primitive BnddIiism,- they accept es genuine tenets embodted in works which were writterL in a language foreign to Baddhist literatue, whether saceed or profane, promulgated in a foreign country, and which are of a date from 1,100 to 1,200 years after Buddha's first preaching. Your reviewer and Mr. Barham adopt Burnouf's exposition of Buddhism, as derived from books met with in Nepaul, and written in Sanscrit, copies -of which were presented to the Asiatic Society of Paris by Mr. Bryan Hodgson in 1829. Equally they trust to Hiasn Tsang's fables of the seventh century, and to the practices and beliefs at present existing in China, and in other Buddhist countries. As well might they pronounce primitive Christianity to be portrayed in the lives of the Catholic saints of the middle ages; inthe opinions of the Anabaptists of the 16th century; or in those of the Mormons of the present time ! 1,000 years after Baddha's advent, Fa Hian travelled in Indiafor the purpose of collecting Baddhist books and observing the state of Baddhism. He found the religion declining and corrupted; but in the seventh century, when Hiuan Tsang travelled in India, thechildish religious legends he relates, and the superstitions that prevailed, prove that a rapid change was takin g placo; Buddhism was fast declining, and modern Brahminism was rising in its place. It was in this corrupt state Buddhism found its way to Nepaul about the eighth century; and its legends, superstitions,and dogmas were for the first time recorded in Sanscrit. The grounds for this assertion are that the multik,udinous inscriptions on rocks, pillars, and copperplates, relating to Buddhism up to this time, were in Pali, and the books taken from India to China by the Chinese travellers between the fourth and seventh centuries were equally in Pall, as they exist to this day in Pali although written In the Chinese character. This fact is attested by Dr. Gutzlaff in the catalogne of Chinese books which he transmitted to me, and which is published in the JournaZ of the Royal Asiatic Society. With these proofs that the use of Sanscrit for Buddhist works was a comparatively modern iunovati on, Burnouf and your reviewer are content to receive their impressions of Buddhist doctrines from questionable sources, ins d of going to the sermons preached* or discourses delivered by Buddha himself-to the proceedings of the three Councils held after his death, and to the Dipawanse and Mahawanse. Your reviewer even quotes from Hinan Tsang the puerile legend of Buddha, who, in exaggerated benevolence, gave his own body to a hungry tigress to be devoured-a tale sufficient to discredit the rest of any book in which it might be foundThe matters in dispute between your reviewer and Mr. Barham are exclusively Buddh ist; but your reviewer in his preamble to the disoussion uses the term "Buddhism" as it Ante-Buddhist Brahminism and Post-Buddhist Brabminism were convertible terms, whereas no one knows better than himself, that to the profound scholar who printed the text of the two first " Ushtakaa" of the Big Veda, the world is indebted for the proofs that Brahminisim, in its modern acceptation, had no existence before Buddhism. That scholar has shown us th at there were no temples, no images, no proofs of caste in its modern exclusiveness; that the elements were personifie d and invoked, and offerings made, at first of a simple oharacter, but afterwards animals were offered in sacrifice after the manner of the Jews; and at last in such prof usion, in hecatombs even, that the rivers of blood which flowed appear to have shocked Buddha; and his chief object seems to have been to put a stop to these sacrifices and to spar e animal life, and in consequence the Buddhists repudiateda ll sacrifices. Gentleness, kindness, peace, harmony, philanthropy, love of virtue, and abhorrence of vice are the cha racteristics of Buddhism, and its code of ethics equals th at of any other religion. But it has been sought to throw upon Baddhists the stigma of Atheism, Materialism, and a belief in the annihUation of the soul. These accusations have their origin in the mystical transcendentalismsof a comparatively modern and corrupted state of Buddhism, and which have not any authority from the preachings or discourses of Buddha himself. Buddha constantly refers to a First Cause, another world, and a state of rewards and punishments a fter death. Buddha's own hymn on his becoming Buddha testifies to his belief in God. He speaks of the Builder and Architect who made him and controUed his transmigrations; and the Rev. Mr. Gogerly, in his translation of the Damina Padars, written in Pali, makes Buddha repeatedly speak of the present and fature world-viz., "The sinner suffers in this world, and he wiU suffer in the next world; in both worlds he suffers," &o. Again, "The virtuous man rejoices in this world, and he wiU rejoice ia the next world. In both worlds he has joy," &c. Here is the founder of the religion talking of the present and a future world, expressing his belief in a state of rewards and punishments, &c., -" greatly wiU he (the sinner) suffer in the regions of torments, and greatly will he (the virtu ous man) rejoice in Heaven,"-necessarily, therefore, expressing his belief in a power or being to dispense rewards and punishments. Surely there must be some distortion in reasoning to pronounce such a believer an Atheist I Supposing, however, that the Buddhist may believe in God, your reviewor maintains that he disbelieves the immortality of the soul. The Rev. W. Hardy, however, says t, "Materialism, Atheism, and the entire cessation of existence stand or faU together; if the two former could be proved the third would foUow as a matter of course,"-that is to say, to believe in aunihilation is to believe in Materialism and Atheism. The charge of " annihilation" is founded upon a comparatively modern interpretation of the Baddhist doctrine of Nibutti (" Nirvana" in Sanscrit), or absorption into the First Cause. And what is this Nibatti, but that the soul, having quitted its human tenement, and passed through its multiplied transmigrations, all of which are probationary processes, in case it attains to absolute perfection it is again received into that Being from whom it originally emanated; hut short of that perfection, the soul remains separate and apart, wandering throngh its prescribed habitations, until it does attain to perfection. N ~ow, though this doctrine may shock the Christian's idea of the i,nmateridl condition of man in another world, ie is certainly neither Atheism, Materialism, nor Annihilation. Your obedient servant.

ROYAL ORTOPCMDIC HosprrL.-The 17th anniversary of this institution Was celebrated yesterday by a dinner at the London Tavern, presided over by Lord Feversham. The noble chairman, in Proposing the toast of the evening, " Success to the Royal Orthopcedic Hospital," after explaining the scope and purpose of the institution, stated that the number of patients admitted during the past year was 1,532, the whole naumber admitted since the toundation of the hospital having been 19,769. The ordinary funds of the insttution had continued to increase, the receipts for the past year having exceeded those of any previous year, amounting altogether to 4,0221. 15s. Id. At the same time, tbere were many expenses to be met. Thero wasa mortgage for 6,0001. to be redeemed, for which pro. vision miust be imiade freus year to year; there were also nearly 200 severe cases waiting for admission, for whom nothing could be done until they were received into tho w7ards. It was no longer wantof room which prevented their ,admission, fortwoof the largeet rooms in the hospital were spIll unoccupied, the conversion of which into ward s would *inccease the accommodation for in*patients to nearly 60 beds. T-he nstitution was entirely depeaadent upon voluntary eontribuntons to enable it to meettlie demands which were raade upon A, and he trusted that the subscriptions for the present year would surpass those of previouw b ears. The appeal of the nohieahairman was well responded to, the subscriptions announced during the eydning amounUng to 2,160t.

ABOHITBPTURAJ. C1ITIOIM AND T2HB NEW PUrBLIC OFFICES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TlIES. Sir,-Many others besides myself have doubtlessly ad. mired the praiseworthy silence you have maintained in the matter of any adjudication of the designs for the proposed Government offices and improvements now exhibiting at Westminster.hal], thus setting an example of impartiality that few other of either the day or weekly journals, I fear, have shown; for any criticism to be fair must be simply im. possible in only one hurried inspection of the drawings, and get bn such hurried view-it cannot be called an examina. tion-many of your contemporaries have not hesitated to bestow, as far as is in their power, the prize on some one or other of the designs, without giving one single reason why t5hSerfavourite merits this distinction above its less happy A strict criticism of such a mass of drawings as are now banging at Westminster would, of course, be no light laboar if each drawing or set of drawings were separately taken and considered from all the many positions in which an architectural work may and must be viewed if a just idea of that single3 drawing or design is desired and without refereneo to certain leading and special requirements previously decided on by the Government; but the affair may be so simplified that an honest opinion may be (compa a- tively) easily arrived at as to the merits of a large bulk of the esigns in question by any person who may be sufficiently iterested to note the following few simple sag. gestions, remembering, should theythink they are based on too utiltaian a notion, that, as one of the competitors says (or intends to say) in his motto, "XLe beau d&ive du vrai, lc tva' en architecture c'est lutite." It is, of courss, known that the Government propose.firstly, that there shall be a concentration of the public offices in one spot i and their first list of instractions relate to this matter, tiey offering several large premiums for the best block plan showing such concentration of offices and suggestions for improvements in the accesses to the same, &c The first point, therefore, for a critic to consider is the perfection of such intended concentration as regards convenience of the proposed localities of the seve ooffircesfor a ready and easy access from one office to another,where the business of two or more may be brought together. 'The second point is the question of area, and how far the com. titor as attended to the requisition respecting such set [ rorth ia the Government particulars. The third point might be to consider the architectural effect of each office iu detail, of the general effect of the whole block of offices, and of the latter and the surrounding buildings, as the Parliamenthouses, the Abbey, &c. With these three points borne in mind, a visitor may, with no great labour, prett nearly guess, not the one 'oest design, hot the cass (few I fear m number) from which the best will be selected; for, if the first point be not attended to-namely, convenience,one of the great aims of the proposed concentration will be lost, and the plan be worthless ; if the second point be not attended to-viz., area-the plan is not, of course, in accordance with the Government requirements- and, if the third point be neglected, the naton will lose the opportunity or one of the grandest architectural displas in the world. There may be in the Exhibition a pln com bining all three and perhaps other points of merit. If thste be such, that plan should have the premium; if there be no euch plan, then one combining the first and second points should receive the prize; but, if only one point of merit can be discovered, then that of convenience should receive the palm, taking it of course for granted that the principal object of the Government is really the concentration of the offices; improvements in the approaches being merely subsidiary to the former, although the latter is worthy in itself of great attention. The second and third proposals of the Government are the immediate erection of offices for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of War, and also an official residence for the former,-all to be erected on a given plot of ground (shown on the block plan), each building to be of a stated number of stories in height (viz., basement, ground one and two pair floors), each floor to contain certain stated departments; each department to have a fixed number of rooms, each of a given area, and in a stated relative position, and al to contain commodious staircaEes, corridors, balls, conveniences; and the buildings, of course, to have due external architectural effect. The first question for the critic wil therefore be, can the buildings be erected on the given sites? If they cannot, then, of course, such designs are valueless, for who would think of erectingahouse planned to cover his neighbour's as well as his own ground, and throw himself open to an action for trespass ? The second question would be, dothe designs contain all or most of the requirements of the Govern. ment as set forth in their proposals? For who would employ an architect who set at nought (as if his client's desires were nought) all that he had been particularly appointed to carry out 7 And thirdly, there should be taken into consideration the external architectural effect, but not until the former points are decided-for who would wish to have to foUow Lord Chesterfield's advice to General Wade, that "as he (the General) could not live in it (his new house) to his ease, he had better take a house over against it and look at it-" the General's architect having built him a house witi a beautiful exterior, but very inconveniently planned? If these three poimts are attended to, then (as I said of the block plan), will the visitor have but small difficulty ian arriving at a shrewd idea of the few designs from which the two to be carried out ought to be chosen; and, again following what I have said conceraing the block plan, if there be a design for each of the Foreign and NWar offces, containing al the three essentials of adptability for the site, the Government and public requirements, and external architectural beauty, then such designs should receive the first pre:niums. Failure of the first point should entail instant displacement of a design ; failure in the attainment of the second point, however fine the architectural effect externally, should also have the like fate with the former, and thus designs failing in external architectural effect- however much to be deplored, and if not accompanied by the other two defectsshould yet mert the critic's approval, rather than those designs that, though attractive 'o the eye, would be next to useless for the purposes for which the buildings are to be It is possible there may be designs displaying beautiful exteriors, but miserably planned; also others tinely planned, but with miserable exteriors. If there be sach, rather than that there should be a failure in the attainment as nearly as possible of perfect architecture, probably you, Sir, and the public may think with me the rewards might be divided, so that the successful orthographer and the successful ichno. grapher (if I may use these terms) mright together, if no one master has succeeded in combining the two great essentials, raise a bulding or buildings worthy of the age and coontry.

LUNDHiLL COLmLIERY ExPLosioi.-LtNDDL, Wednesday Afternoon.-Since Saturday last only six more bodies have been recovered. Of these two were brought out on MTonday, and one of them was identified as that of George Thompson, one of the leaders of the Oaks strike, letters from whom on that occasion were published in The Times and othor daily papers. One was found on Tuesday and the other three to-day (Wednesday) on the north side, where the men are still busily engaged in clearing away the roof. An inspection of the pit was made yesterday by the engineers for the purpose of laying before the jury, which meets on Thursday, the state of the pit up to that time, and, ifpossible, to give some idea of the caise of the terrible accident. 'The position taken by the guardians of the Barnsley Union, in refusing to give only tlh smallest relief to the sufferers who get any support from the funds raised for their aid, having caused great dissatisfaction, and communications having been sent from Wakefield, Sheffield, and other places, stating that the subscriptions should not be sent if they were to be applied for the relief of the rates, an extraordinary n'eeting of the board was held yesterday. A deputation from the subscription committee had an interview with the board, when Mr. Parker ably enforced the claims of the suffererp, stating that the sub. scriptions amounted at present to 9,500.L, but of that sum 2. 000 was subscribed in Sheffield and 1,00 1. in Wakefield. Both those places, it was understood, would refuse to pay over those sums if they were to be at all applied in relieving the ratepayers of their responsibility. The same was the case with Messrs. Woodhouse and Jeffcock, through whom 8351. had been subcscibed in various collieries in the midland district, includin,g 953. received that morning from Earl Granville's colliery. The deputation also stated that the committee had in view the establishing of an institution for the rslief of sufferers by colliery accidents occurring in the district. Mr. J. Tyas remarked that the formatiou of an institution such as that alluded to had enged the attention of the Coaltuasters' Association at their last meeting, and he had nob the slightest doubt of one being' established in a mnanner satisfactory to both masters an(i mien. By this means appealh for support would be entirely done away with, The deputation having retired, the subject was discussed by the board, who agreed to allow relief to the sufferers to the extent desred by the committee. It was stated that X num b.: of children bad been born since the ex .losion, so that tho original number of 190 now exceeded 200, and several more would yet have to be added to the number. The number of bodies recovered has now reached 10 FATAL RAILWAY BoiLEr EXPLOSiON.-LIVERpoOL fay 20-The inquest on the bodies of Joseph Ford, driver, and Seth FoulkEs, fireman of the loesuiotive enDne St. Patrick, who were killed by an explosion of the boiler at the Edge-hill station of the London and North-Western Railway, closed to-day before the coroner for the borough.

THE AZLrnRD .POISONING AT STAMFOPD. STAMFORD, MAY 20. The examination of Thomas Fuller Bacon, on the charge of having poisoned his mother with arsenic, was resumed at -the Ton-hall, before the borough magistratcs today. On lMonday Mr. Atter, who had conducted Bacon'a defenoe, roe linquished the case. In consequence of this the prisoner, at his own request, was furnished with writing materials, and took notes of the evidence. As before, the prisoner appeared perfectly self-possessed. Mr. Mfark Wilson Jackeon, surgeon, of Stamford, was the first witness examined today. He described the post. 2nortem appearance presented by the by body of Ann Baoon, exhumed at Great Uasterton on the 6th of Februay last The contents of the abdomen were in a high staTe of preservation, considernng that the body had been interred two years. The condition of the viscera was such as would be produced by arsenic. The limbs and other parts which would not be subjected tothe action of arsenic, sapposing it to have been taken by the deceased, were much decom- Pro E. Barber, the gurgeon who attended the decased, was nextcalled.-He was first sent for to deeased in March 3855, when he found her suffering from spasms. He prescribed for her, and she gradually recovered; heriUlnes on that occaesion extending over about 10 days. On Sunday, the 13th of May, witness was again called in to attend deceased,-who had been taken il that afternoon at her son Thomas's. Witneuss found her very faint, and vomiting. She had been seized with sickness and purging soon after dinner. Deceased was removed to her own house, where witness continued to attend her until her death, which took placeon the following Taesday. The symptoms manifested y deceased on Tuesday were similar to those of the iUness in March; she suffered at times from spasms in her limbs as wellas in her body. The symptoms witness saw on the Sunday were precisely thos whicharsenic would produce. On the Tuesday the symptoms were not the usual and ordii nary symptoms produced by arsenical poison, and witness gave a certificate to the effect that deceased died I from cerebral disease. He came to that concluslon from the snptoms on the Tuesday being similar to those he bad observed in March, and from the fact that she had never been thoroughly well upto the attack in May, though she had not been so much indisposed as to require medical attendance. Professor Taylor was next sworn. Previous, however, to his being examined the evidence taken at the first hearing on Saturday, when he was not present, vas read over to him. Dr. Taylor then repeated the evidence relative to his analyis of the viCera of the deceased which he gave at the inquest, and which we published at the time. lis concluF' iDnswereass unrder: L The body of the deceased, Ann Bacon, contained arsenic, which mnst have been taken by or administered to her while living. 2. That the arsenic was found in the largest proportion, fist, in the intestines; secondly, in the liver and gall bladder; and, thirdly, in the stomach. The kidneys and spleen contained a small qnantity the heart and bloody liquid of the chest contained none. §. That the total quantity extracted from the different parts was small-namely, about three-quarters of a grain. 4. That the parts containing the arsenic were well preserved, but presented none of the appearances which are usually produced by this poison. 5. That whether the deceased died from the effects of the arsenic or natural disease can onlv be determined by the symptoms from which she suffered in the illness preceding her death. (A portion of the arsenic, deposited on a slip of copper, was produced in court.] Dr. Taylor added tbat, having heard the evidence, he drew the conclusion that the symptoms described to have occurred in the second illness, of pain, vomiting, purging, and thirdt were such as were commonly produced by arsenic ; that the twitching, delirium, and atiffnes of the body on the Tuesday were such as may be produced by arsunic when a person has survived the effects of the poison two or three days. They were not commonly observed in cases of poisoning by arsenic, beoause death generally took place within 24 hours, and in the stage in which the stomach and bowels were affected. Findin arsenic in the body, he should refer the first symptoms of the attack in May to the operation of that poison. A larger portion of - arsenio was found in th body than was ever given in medicine. When I used in medicine it is given in a dose of one-twelfth or one- eighth of a grain. A Magistrate.-Do you think that arsenic caused lrs. fBacon!s death ? Witness.-There is a [difficulty in answering that question. The first part of the illness, I have no doubt, was caused by arsenic. The evidence of Mr. Barber, as well as of Mary Riley, regarding the attack in March, and the fact, as stated by Mr. Barber, that the deceased never thoroughly recovered from that attack, render it proWable that there may have been some disease of the brain or nervous system, and that the symptoms on the Tuesday, as observed by Mr. Barber, which resembled those in March, may have been due to a relapse and proved fatal in May. The evidence of Mary Reily in reference to the attack in Mrh, wvhere she tateS that the deceased was " sick and stiff with spasms," is not sufficient to lead me to believe that that attack was due to the action of arsenic; but the symptoms of the May attack, taken as a whole, were quite consistent with death by arsenio. If I had had to give an opinion from the attack in May alone, I should have said the deceased died from arsenic. There was no natural caunse of death that we could find about the body, so far as the examination would allow us to judge. The arsenic found in the body was not sufficient to kill an adult, but the quantity taken might have been diminiished by vomiting and purging. The smallest quantity of arsenic known to have caused death is two grains, but a grain might kill some persons, though I have snown an instance of recovery after taking a grain and a- half. The only parts of the body of deceased in a state of preservation were those in which arsenic was found. The prisoner declined to ask Professor Taylor any question. Superintendent fitchell was the lastwitness. Re merely deposed to the removal of the viscera, &c., in jars, to London. The prisoner was then cautioned in the usual way, and asked if he wished to say anything. Prisoner.-No. The prisoner was committed for trial at the next Lincoln assizes, Mh. Reed, chief constable of Stamford, being bound over to prosecute.
THE HEW COURr OF PROBATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Allow me, through the medium of your valuable journal, to call the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a singular provision in the Testamentary Bill presented by the Lord Chancellor, and which is calculated to operate in a manner most prejudicial to the public revenue. It is proposed that the district registrars shall grant probate and letters of administration when the property is under 1,500., and it is at the same time proposed that the district registrars shall be paid by fees in contrast to the London registrars, who are to be paid by salary. As the fees will depend upon the amount of business transacted in each registry, it will obviously be for the interest of the district registrars that the value of the property should in each case be kept below 1,5001., othervise the grant must sme from the London registry, whereas it is for the in. terest of the public revenue, in regard to the stamp duty, that the estimate should not be allowed to pass the registiy at less than the true amount of the property, which can only be secured by the vigilant supervision of the district registrar. A pradent legislator would aordingly seek to place the interest of the public officer in harmony with the interest of the public revenue, and by assigning a fixed salary to each district registrar relieve him from any motive to increase his fees. It has no doubt escaped the attention of the high legal functionary under whose auspices the Bill has been introduced that the interest of all the persons engaged in the probate of wills in the district registries, whether executors, proctors, or registrars, will be arrayed against the Exchequer, whereas the registrar, at least, should be made its friend.

PALL OF HOU2SB TOTTBNHA.M-COUBT-ROAD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I regret to say 'bhat several errors have crept into your report of this inquest, arising, no doubt, from the difficulty which non-professional persons mnust experience in understanding terms and references so purely technical as those mentioned by the several professional witnesses. One of the most important in your impression of to-day you will, I hope, allow me to correct, as it is calculated to iLnuure me. One of the witnesses, Mr. Reding. is represented as having said, "1Mr. Baker knewv the holes were to be cut," that is, in the party wal which fell down. Neither Mr. Reading nor any other witness has ever ventured to assert this. and it is wholly untrue - on the contrary, the whole of the evidence, both oral and written, tends to prove that, as far as my limited power extends, I had done everything in order to obtain the condemnation of the whole wail, and that it was in the vain attempt to patch and repair what was irreparable that the dowrfall came. It would be improper for me, pending the inquiry, to make any further remarks, but, at a futare period, I trust you vill allow me to explain the system adopted for the removal of dangerous structures, and " the reason why" the power of the district surveyor fs limited. I am. Sir. VoUr obedient pmvAnt HENRY BARRR. 11, UJpper Gower street, May 20.
ANOTHER POISONNG CAsE.-A little girl, four years old, has been poisoned at the village of Belah, in the parish of AUan, about five mUes from Truro, the crime having been committed, as sunposed, by the mother and grandfather of the child. Graco Beard, the mother, formerly lEved as servant with Mr. Cradock, an auctioneer, at Truro, but lately she has been residing with her father John Beard, at Belah. The child died suddenly in April last, and at the inquest a verdict of natural death wtas returned. From circumstances v hich sunbsequently transpired, ho ever, the bode of the child was exhumed, and an analysis having been made by hir. doerapsth, of Bristo, that gentleman discovered arsenic. Trhe mother, on being taken into custody, aidothather father hadvsent her to Truro en the 1st of April to procure some poison, hut that ehe did not knowr what8she did with it, though she believed that she had murdered her child wvith it, and had accused her father of having done so. ThEe grandfather, wrho is described as a di6solate old man, denies having sent his dauehterfor poison. The supposed motive for the crime on the part of the mother is that she wished to get rid of this illegitimete child, as she was about to be married to a young man named Champion. Both prisoners have been remanded. BEMSTOL SUGAR-MAnnE, Wednesday, 3May 20. -There is not a single parcel of goods now offering in first bands, everything having been sold at extreme ratep.

Two. ears ag the actors, we believe, were asnew to Paris as they now are to London, but they heve learned to work admirably together, and there is notaxipart, however not filled toperfection. X.Pradeau,whoistheleadn "e is of itself sufficient to excite the mirth of a Stoic, anct tbhi natural advanltage is Improved a hundredfola by tha~ variety Of expresive grimaces which the artist has at coDramand, and calls forth on every occasion. His blind beagee is of itself a great creation M. Ger 6, the niext ia rank, makes a complete picture of the Norman Iothario_ laudry, most awkward when he thinks himelf mos6 fascinating, but yet 'ust such a being as mig ht claim.. the admiaton of the0 rusic beauty, SO well plAYciiA by Mademoiselle Marehal. X Gnyot is natii-eitself as the rustic husband, good.humoured at bottom but subject to strange acceses of jealous fnrcy which commonly make him snatch up his pipe and rush into, tho open air. Mademoisell Dalmont, who represents thebuxom good-wfe of aNormandy, has an excellent voice, an. indeed -it is a qualification of all the artists th most efcient singers. The repertory of theo"Boaffes tr- sianas demands something more than that style of vocaliza. tion which is allowed to pass muster in ordinary vaudevilles, every piece havng music of its own, thet proper execution of which is necessary to thegeneral effect. In Ba-ta-clan ML Pradeau, Gertpr,& Guyot, and Mademoiselle Dalmont appear as operatie vocalists in spite of the grotsque nature of the situations, andtheirperformanceinthisrespect isworthy of th,highesl. commendation. The completeness which gives a charm to the whole enter, hinment is extended to the costumes and decoratious. Thedress ol the Norman pents is carefully studied, thefilde% clothes of "M'sieur Landr=' being just of a kind thatnone but exactly such an Adonis would dream of putting op, and costly, indeed, are the Chinese habilbments worn iu. Ba-cn-l. For Les ceux AvVeles a very pretty scene of' abridge across the Seine, with lxotre Dame in the distance, is introduced. Altogether the audience must haveleft the, theatre with the comfortable conviction that although thefarce had been of the lightest kind the cookery was unex. ceptionable. Tho " Bonffes Parisions" intend to remain with us ai month, and ply every night, so that if the inhabitants ot this metropoLs do not pass four merry weeks it will not b% the fault of Mr. John Mitchell.
