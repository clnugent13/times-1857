IFOEIGN INTBlTlC4IVNTh7 FRANLOE. (FROX OIU O-WN CORRES110NDE:hT.) (The followilg appeared in our second edition of yester,day .-I PARIS, THURSDAY, DEC. 10, 6 p.m. The Caurrier de Paris has a very long article tending to show the abaolute necessitv of supporting the Empire. I subjoin two extracts- " During the six years which have elapsed between December 2, 18.31, and Dec. 2, 1857, the following eve!Ats have occrred :-The vote -f Dec. 20, 1851, for the Presidency; the vote of Nov. 20, 1852, for the Empire; the general elections of February 29, 1852, and June 21, 1857; the recognition of the Empire by the Governments of the -whole world; the choice of Paris for the deliberations of the Congress to settle the conditions of peace after the war in the Crimea; the visits to France of the Queen of England; of the heir presuu ptive to the throne of Belgium, the grandson of Louis Philippe; of the Grand Duke Constantine, brother of the Emperor of Russta; and of the King of Sardinia; and, finally, the inter. view at Stattgart. It is imposaible not to take such events into account. Frankly speaking, no one can maintain that the situation of power in France is the same this day, Dec. 9, 1857, which It was on Dec. 9, 185L One great proof of tl e change is the altered tone of the English and American press." Referring to the coming elections for Paris, it says:- "' We declae openly beforehand that we shall alike repudiate those inconsistent candidates who first sign the electoral bulletin required by law, and afterwards refuse the oath, and those hybrid candidates who enter the Legislative Body with a secret resolve to undermine and overthrow the e ,tablfshed Government, We shall only support those who entertain that sincere desire to strengthen power by liberty which animated Casimir P6rier, nnder the elder, and Odillon Barrot under the younger, branch of the Bourbons."

There is nothing new of any sort or kind to be reported to-day from this place. As there is no accession of bad news in the money world, the tone of feeling appears. to be firmer, but nevertheless the quotations, partieularly of shares in recently created banking-houses supposed to be more or less Implicated in commercial and manufacturing circles, continue to sink, Fsom the Dresdener Jouinoal we learn thabt the Saxon G)overnment, in pursuance of an authorization extended to it by the Chambers, ix about to open a Bank for advances on goods in Leipsic. Such an irntitution was resorted to in 1848, and it was found efficacious on that oceasion. In Copenhagen the King of Denmark convoked a Ministerial Council yesterday forenoon, with a view to deliberating on the beat means of meeting the present crisis. The day previously 400,000 rixdollars had been forwarded to HEamburg, in the hopes of propping up the house of Pontopidan and Co. The excitement in Copenhagen had been very great on hearing of the suspension of the above-mentioned house in Hamburg, which, however, was somewhat tranquillized on its transpiring that the National Bank had taken this step towards relieving it. General Todtleben, who is now staying at Wiesbaden, fell with his horse on the 6th inst. in the neighbourhood of the Kursaal, and broke his right arm. HAMBURG. A telegram dated Hamburg, Wednesday evening, says:- " The firm of M. Pontopidan, the Danish Consul, has received assistance from the Danish Goverment, and is enabled to continue its operations." SPAIN. The foUowing private telegram has been received "MADRID, DEC. 9. "The Prince of the Asttriss has been baptized. An amnesty has been granted for all political offences, and to persons condemned for slight offences. Twenty-two colonels have been promoted, and a number of the oldest lieutenants have been made captains. Numeroas decorations have been distributed."
GREENV v. BA YLEY. TO TEH EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On my return to Ireland a few days since I read your report of this caseo, which was tried before the Chief Baron on Monday, tbe 30Oth of November last, and which is reported in your publication on the 1st in8t., and find it contains the oloUowing statement: *-It appeared that the late Ulsa Eey (should be MSrs), who wa so asbaroesly and myseriously aisalnated Sn Ireland, whUe in the company of her nephew, the defeadant, had a manbion and a small estate In Susex. caied Uckdeillhouse, which she bad Oommnsoned the pIabitiff to seU jubt before her death." Any person reading the report would rnaturaUy think I was present at the time and place she was murdered at. Now, this would be doing me great injustice, as I was actually at the time at this place, which had for soma years before been my residence, and which is distant from where she was murdered more than 30 miles. It is true that another nephew of hers, whose name is not Bayley, was present at the time the crime was committed. I do not know where your reporter obtained the information that I was present at the murder. There was no statement to that effect made by any of the counsel or witnesses in the case, so that he must have been sup. plied with it from other sources. I am sure that gentleman would not willingly give currency to any falsehood affeot. ing the character of any man. I feel satisfied he was imposeed On. AS your paper contained the imputation on. me. I a ppeal to your sense of justice and Impartiality to insert this letter to set me right with my friends, and those whose good opinion I value. I am. Sir. vour verv obedienn RArvank R. P.

SUICMDE OF A FBENoH GENnB ;AN.-On Thumday evening Mr. William Payne held an inquest at the Vestry.room of St. Saviour's, Southwark, on the bodv of a French gentleman, who committed suicide at the Bridge. housm Hotel, London-bridge, and who Is supposed to be M. Joseph Baudot, formerly connected with some extensive ironworks in France. On Friday evenig last the deceased went to the Bridge-house Hotel; after dinner he remarked that his luggNse was at the railway-station, and retired to bed. As he did not make his appearance during the whole of the following day, the door was forced open, and he was discovered suspended from the bedstead by a silken bell. rope, and quite dead. The floor was scattered with small pieces of paper, and on the dressing-table was a slip of writing paper, on which was the following in the French language:-" I die voluntarily; I am the victim of destiny. I know it is wrong to die so, and that it is contrary to the catholic religion, in wvhich I am bern, but I cannot survive my ruin." This was unsigned, but in a corner was the word "Saturday." The fragments of several documents were carefully collected and pasted together, and from what could be made out it would seem that the deceased had been formerly in excellent circumstances, and that he had credentials from the mayors of several towns in France. Poverty had evidently overtaken him, for, although a por. tion of his attire was in order, and his linen of a superior qualty, his boots were much worn, and he had no stc kings, and only two sous wero found in his pockets. It was ascertained that up to Thursday he lcdged at the Hotel de Normandie, Red Lion-street, Borough, and that fearing to be asked for payment he stated that his luggage was at the Waterloo-station, but on going with one of the waiters there was no lug age, and he informed the station-master that he left it at the Hotel de Commerce, Southampton, and stoned his name in the books " Catte Alexaudra." Since his death this statement had been found to be incorrect. Up to the time he left the Hotel de Normandie he seemed to be in the best spirits, and was even remarkable for his gaiety. He appeared to be about 32 years of age, was considerably above the middle height, and had very haudsome features. The jury consulted or some time as to whether their verdict should be feto de se, but ultimately that of *Temporary Insanity" was returned. TuE OHRISTMAS HOLYDAYS.-In the large towns of Essex, and many other places, it has been laudably determined by all the tradesmen to "shut ap shop" from the evening of Thursday, the 24thl (Christmas Eve), to the morning of Monday, the 28th of December, astogive their employes a olear holyday of three days, and afford them a full opporhunity of recruiting their exhausted enerFies after the festivitits of Christmas-day, whieh falls on sre 'z iday.
RAILWVAY AZND MfNINS SHARES. Friday Evening. The Railway-market was dull during the day until just before the close, when an active demand arose for several of the leading descriptions, and London and North-Western, Midland, Lancashire and Yorkahire, Great Northern, Caledonian, and Eastern Counties, left off at an advance of i to per cent. North-Eastern stocks were exceptionally t at. Indian were in better demand, especiaUy the smaller shares, and Indus flotilla improved to J to J premium. Grand Trunk of Canada andl Geedong and Meibourne, receded. Foreign generally wero Slightly higher. The transactions- int American securities were confined to Illinois Central, which showed increazed heavines, the shares being quoted 12 to 10 discount. Canada Government Bonds were again in request, and closed at an advance of fully 1i per cent. No important variation occuired in mines. Joint-stockbanks were steady, and show little variation. In misceUlaneous securities the only change was a nominal decline in National Discount; IPeninsular and Oriental were firm at the late improvement. ORDISAXY SfARRR Alr WPA(&Q CANALS.

PA LIMENTARY INTELLuIZNC E. HOUSE OF LORDS, Fxaaw, ;Dea. 11. 'The LORD CHAXCFmLLOR took his seat onrthe woolsack at uhe usual hour. AFRICAN EMIGRATION T?O ' E FRENCH COLONIES. The EArl of SHAiTESBURsaiRt,eeinghisnoblefriend the Secretay of State for Foreign Affairs in his place he 'wouldl ask him & question relative to the state of the contract suppofed to exist between a house in Marseiles and some African chiefs for the supply of free emigrants to the French colonies. It had been Teported that this contract was ratified by * decree of hba eImperial Government, and the people of England were fearfully alive to the probable, may, almos oertain revival of the horrors of the African slave trade. He wied to ask how far this report was le; whether, If the decree had been issued, there was any hope of its revocation, and generally what waas the position of the whole matter? The EArl of CLARENON said, in answer to the question of hix noble frend he had to state that he had ro reson to believe that the decree to which his noble friend alluded had been issued; but he believed there was no doubt that a contract had been entered into by the French Government and a certin firm for the supply of negroes to the French colonies, which only received the sanction of the French Government on condition that it was to be bond fide a free esigation. Now there could be no such thing as a free emigzation from Africa. (Cheers.) We ourselves had tried the experiment 16 years ago, and with every precaution and every safeguard to prevent abuses, so as to secure the freedom of the AfrIcan labourer ,on his pssge and hiF proper treatment whlle employed in our iolonies, as well as to guarantee his return home at the expiration of his engagement If he wished it. That plan utterly and entirely failed (hear, hear), and it waa not likely that it would ever succeed under any circumstnces. (Hear, hear.) But this was what the French contractors were compolled to do. They engaged with the African chiefs to supply a certain number of slavea at ao much a head, who were placed on board of ahip, when a certain formality was gone through, with the view of ascertaning whether they were willing to work at stated wages In tho French colonles, or not. Now, whether the negroes understood that queation or not, It was manifest that when onoe on board of ship they had no choice in the matter. (Hear, hear.) Beides, the result was that by this system the French contractors were brought into com. petition with the regular slavedealers, who offered 90 dollars a-head for slaves, while the French contraotors had only the power to give 50 dollars There had been some faUure of the oontract, but that in no way altered the character of the transaction, because if laves were to be procured at all it muEt be by purchase, and they oould not be obtained unless the chiefs made war upon their neighbours, It being, of course, a matter of utter fndifference to those chiefs whether those slaves, whom they sold to the highest bidders, were manumitted after their arrival in the French colonies, or whether they were worked to death. (Hear, hear.) The vars carried on with that view were ,of the most barbarous character and caused great loss of life. Whole distriets were depopulated, and not one half of those captured survived the sufferings they met with on their way to the coast. TXho French contractors aid that It was an act of humanity to the negroes themselves to give them that opportunity of emigrating to places where they could be profitably employed- But he would remind their lordships that it was putting a stop to that legitimate and prosperous trade which within the last few years had sprung up on the coast of Africa in almost every locality in which the slave trade had been carried on, and by which the natives of Africa were greatly bonefitted. In the spring of this year he (the Earl of Clarendon) received two despatches on this subject, which were of such. great interest and contained such full and valuable Information as to the trade in palm oil that he did not wait to have them published in the regular course, but laid them at once upon the table of their lordshipe' House. (Hear, hear.) Since that time he had ascertained that the trade at Lagos In palm oil had Increased 50 per cent,, and now amounted to upwards of 2,000,0001. a-year. But the whole of this rising trade and this incroasing prosperity to the Africans was now threatened with destruction if this sygtem were carried on. (Hear, hear.) There vrere now extensive preparations for war being made in all the countries from which the slaves were brought, and as the matter was one of so much interest and importance he would read a very short extract from a deepatch which he had received from li. Campbell, the consul at Lagos. Mr. Campbell, at the beginning of September last, wrote, in allusion to the contract of MI. Regis, that,- " Unless the intention of purchaslng slaves at Whyda ish abandoned we shall have the whole of the Youraba country plunged into warfare to suppl the demand of the slave-mar- et at Whydah. The examp e of the people of Abookuta Is to be followed by the people of lbaddan, who are preparing to attack the Jaboo country, and, as a preliminary step, several Jaboos peacefully attending the market at Ibaddan have been seized, some put to deatb, others sent to Why. dah for sale, and all intercourse between the two countries has been stopped by the olosing of the paths and roads, and if tho speculation of Mi. Regis is carried out it will be followed by other conutries. ' But the people of that country had during the IAst 30 years acquired such a taste for industrial pursuits, and had become so much alive to the advantages arising therefrom, that It was with the utmost reluctance they were now induced to engage in wars, whlle formerly every man was eager for strife and plunder, and the chiefs were now actually compelled to suspend all trade, and to deprive the people of all means of livelihood, before they could Induce them to engage in hostilitles. In order to prove that fact, he would read an ex. trat from a proclamation issued by the chief of Abbeo- kuta:- " L In order to procure a large army for the Aibo war, soon to be undertaken, trade must be stopped now, and during the war nothing must be sold and nothing bought. "2. In order to this the passengers by land and the river to Ijal, Ibaddan, Lagos and other adjaent towns that trade with Abbeokuta must be stopped. "3. No canoe shallhbeallowed to appear in the river, excepting the misionaries, who are no traders. e4 lhat Instant death on the spot be the penalty inficted upon violation of any of these rules." It was not necessary to enter into further details, but he thought he had said enough to prove that the Government were alive to the dangers of any suoh scheme as had been alluded to. It would, therefore, be readily understood that It had been their duty to bring the matter under the serious consideration of the French Government, not doubting but that Government felt an equal abhorrence of any attempt to revive the slave trade, and also not doubting that although no convention existed at this moment between the two countries, set that the French Government would feel itself bound to act upon the spirit of the -declaration made by the great Powers that slavery should exist no more in any of their colonies, and that they would prevent their subjects from engaging in it directly or indirectly. The British Government told the French Government tbat they believed the latter had proceeded on erroneous information, and only required to be put in possession of facts to be induced to put an end to a system, which, however benevolent in intention, must inevitabl lead to great danger of a revival of slavery. The answer of the French Government had been, that while tbey fully admitted the engagement to discourage slavery to be binding upon them, yet they did not consider the steps which were in progress to obtain a supply of free labour for their colonies constituted any violation of that engagement, but that, on the contrary, It was an act of humanity to pro. eure that labour in an honest and open manner, which otherwise would be procured with all the horrors of a clandestine slave trade. At the same time the French Government desired that there should be no abuse of the system, and they would take into their serious consideration the representations which had been made to them by Her Majesty's Government, In order to stop any inconveniences which might arise. The French Government also admitted t, alt hough there was no treaty between themselves and this country, yet they were bound to act up to the . spirit of the declaration of the Congress, and that they were now as anxious to put an end to the slave trade as they were in 1815. That declaration was so short that he (Lord Clarendon) thought it weuld be useful at the p resent time to recalits terms tothe public mind. The dectaration of the eight Poiers in 1816 was,- n-sabi the PlellPotcedtivares as-s-emnblcd a8-t"t'h'is Cogrcs3 cannot do greater credit to their mission, better fulfil their duty, and manifest the principles which actuate their august sovereigns, than b endeavouring to carry this engagement into effect, and by proclaiming, in the name of their sovereignu, their wish gt,ng au end to h ecourge which has so long desolated Africa, degraded Europe, and afflicted humanity. Consequently, &c., that the engage. ment reciprocally contracted in the p-esent declaration between the sovereigns who are partics to it cannot be considered as completely fuflled until the period when complete success shall have crowned their united efforts." To thab declaration the French Government had expressed its emphatic determination to adhere. He had now stated the actual state of affairs, and thought, after the assurances ,of the French Goverament, there was great reason to hope that at no distant day the system which had created such universal consternation among the well-wishers of .Africa would be entirely aoolshed. The Earl of DERBY did not doubt the sincerity of the Y?rench Governmert when they stated their belief that in sancationing this system they had no idea of a revival of the slave trade. Every one, however, who was acquainted with the subject was fully awae that, as the noble earl had said, a supply of free labour from Africa was absolutely impossible. (HIear, hear.) Whatever precaution might be taken, with whatever safeguards the system might le surrounded, ib would speedily become a slave rade in a disguise so thin and transparent that no .one ould doubt Its character. (Hear, hear.) It was well ;known that in Africa the people had no power to dispose of themseli es, and a supply of labour could only be obtained Maecce git&er by direct purchase or by the indirect .metbnd 9f jnabling the labourer to pay the chief for a license to quit the country, which, in fact, was a sale by the chief of the m whom he allowed to ba taken away. i Ihere was only one portion of the answer of the noble earl which was not perfectly satisfactory, and that was the statement that the French Government, while expressing its determination to adhere to its engagements to suppress the slave trade, still did not consider the scheme which bWd been referred to came at all under that denomination, and I that therefore they could not feel bound to discountenance i it. The noble earl had not given the House to understand that he had been able to prevaidl uponx the French Government to put an end to the system which was objeoted to, but only that they would put an end to al the inconveniences attaching to the system. He (Lord Derby) emphatically declared his full conviction that, surroun( such a systemn with all possible safeguards, it would impossible to prevent abuses, but put an end to the system itself. (Hear, hear.) The French Government were dcceiving themselves and neglecting the experience acquired by England if they did not perceivo that the maintenarce of the mstem is it now stood was identical in substnce, if not in form, with the slave trade itself. (Elear, hear.) The E:arl of CLRENJ)ON.-I was extremely desirous in replying to the question of my noble friend not to overstate,and thereforef gave as nearly as possible the words used by the French Government, but I have reason to believe, althouqh I cannot at present venture to Ftate-(The noble earl did not conclude the sentence save by a slight gesture.) Earl GREY hoped and trusted that the system which had been brought under their notice would be speedily abandoned. He relied fully upon Her Majesty's Government not to allow this matter to sleep. (Hear, hear.) It would of course be improper under present eircumstanoes to ask that the correspondence should be produced; but if, un. happily-which he did not apprehend-the result of that correspondence should be unsatisfactory, then he boped the papers would be laid before the House, as the only means which they had of acting upon a Rreat country like France was to publish the whole proceedings, and submit them to the judgment of the whole civilUzed world. He would only add a few words from his own experience. Dmring the time he had the honour of holding the seals of the Colonial-office the subject of freo labour had been frequently brought under his notice. He was urged by persons connected with the West Indies to permit free labour to be imported from the coast of Afrca The Government of that day were anxious to do all in their power to relieve the colonies, and agreed to fit out a steamer and make an endeavour to procure labourers. They sent persons in whom they had confidence to the African coast, and adopted every measure which was suggested to them, save one. It waa urged that it would be an act of humanity to ransom the unhappy prisoners taken in war, as they would be in a better condition as labourers in the West Indies than as captives in Africa; but he (Earl Grey) always sad that it was against the plain principle that "you can't buy stolen goods without sharing the gunilt of the thief." (Hear, hear.) U.n that plain priunple the Government would not allow a shUiing to be givin either to the immigrant on board the ship or to the chief atlo v on rican coast. Upon these conditions, however, only some 20 or 30 Kroomen had been induced to embark, and the result of that experiment was In his opinion, sufficient to show what might be expected to happen at the present day. He should only add that this was, in his opinion, a moment when especialcare should be taken to prevent so iniquitous a scheme as that which was said to have been set on foot from being carried into execution, inasmuch as It would appear from the representations of those distinguished travellers who had recently returned from Africa that civilization 'was beginningtopenetrateiato the heartof that greatcontinent-astateofthingswhichitwas desirable to foster, instead of promoting a scheme by which the progress which had begun to manifest itself was sure to be checked. (Hear, hear.) The question was one of the deepest importance, not alone to England, bat to the cause of civilization throughout the world, and he therefore hoped that many days might not elapse before the Government of France repudiated all connexion with the movement upon which it was reported to have embarked. (Hear, hear) EARL GRANVILLE AND THE EARL OF DERBY. The Earl of DERBY.-As this, my lords, is the last day -if I be correctly informed-upon which we are likely to meet before the recess, I may be allowed to seize the present opportunity of making a few observations in reference to the extraordinary controversy which has arisen out of a statement which I made en the opening night of the session. I may, perhaps, before proceeding to the particular state. ment to which I refer, remark that I was led into an inaccuracy-although it was one of no importance so far as my argument waa concerned-in stating that one of the first offers made to the Government upon the part of the company to transport troops acroes the Isthmus of Suez was made by the directors of the company, that offer having, as I am now informed, been made by another company. The offer was made in the month of July, and was rejected; and I cannot help remarking that it is somewhat sigular that in the papers which have been laid within the last few days upon the table of the House a letter of the Governor-General of India, dated August 7, appears, In which he states that if the Government at home were not in communication with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam packet Company the Government of India were, Another mistake into which I was led was that of stating that the last offer of the Peninsular and Oriental Steampacket Company to convey troops to India across the Isthmus of Suez was made in the latter end of August, whereas I find from the letter of Mr. Willoox that it was made on the 6th of September. lfow, my lords, with referen , to the main point involved in the controversy which hes taken place between my noble friend opposite (Earl Granville) and myself as to a certain letter alleged to have been written to the Peninsular and Oriental ComDany by the right hon. gentleman the President of the Boaid of Control, I can only say that even up to the present moment I am at a loss to account for the discrepancy which exists between my noble friend's denial of the justice of my statement and the information upon which that statement was based. As my noble friend Lord Hardwicke mentioned to your lordships on a former evening, I expressed my disbelief in the possibility that the story in reterence to the President of the Board of Control corld be true, when It was mentioned to me by my noble friend in the country. When I came up to town, however, I heard the same statement made in another quarter, and I then began to think it necessary to make some inqulry into the matter, and I now hold in my hand a letter which I received from the gentleman who was my informant, in answer to one which I addressed to him on the subject. I should rather not mention the name of the writer of the letter, and perhaps it will be sufficient to assure your lordships that he is aman of station and position. The first part of the letter refers to the refusal upon the part of the Government to accept the offer of the company, and It then proceeds to state the circumstance which is the subject of this controversy-namely, that the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Control actuaUy wrote a letter to one of the directors of the company-Mr. Anderson-to know whether it was possible to organize a scheme for carrying troops by means of their steamers; to which the reply was, that it was not only possible, but that the thing had been already done. I stiUl, however, thought, my lords, that there must be some mistake, and I requested my informant to go back to Mr. Anderson and ascertain still more clearly whether or not the statement was corret. He informed me that Mr. Anderson had'eft England on his way to the East, but he came to me absut 11 o'clock on the night before Parliament assembled and mentioned to me that he had seen Air. Allen, another of the directors of the company, who had confirmed what he had said in reference to Mr. Anderson's having made the statement in question. I, my lords, being under the impression-not only u on the authority of the gentleman to whom I allude, but because the matter was talked of in more than one quarter-that ho had done so, thought myself justified in referring to the subject in this House on the fiast night of the session. The accuracy of my statement upon that occasion haviug been impugned by the noble earl opposite, however, I requested my informant to write to M1r. Anderson, whom I believed to be still in Paris, pointing out the circumEStance that a contradiction had been given to an assertion made upon his authority, and asking him to state how the facts of the case really stood. The contradiction of my noble friend oppositie was given on the Monday, and on Tuesday a letter, a copy of which I hold In my hand, was addressed to Mr. Anderson in accordance with my desire, I am, however, araid that Mr. Anderson has left Paris, inasmuch as no answer to this letter has been received, and I may observe in passing that it seems to me to be not a little remarkable that, although that gentleman was, I beheve, in Parls on the day when the newspapers containing the reports of the debates which took place on the first night of the session, must have reached that city, inasmuch as he has written thence to England since that time, yet he never repudiated, even in the slightest degree, the truth of heallegation which has led to this controversy. (Hear.) Now, my lords, I hold in my hands a letter from Mr. Allen, which I received yesterday, and which, after referrin,gto the circumstance of Mr. Anderson's absence from E3ngland, goes on to state that from the impression which exists in ovnmind, coupled with the subsee-^uent declarations oE the rleht hon. gentlemen the President of the Board of Control, " he has no hesitation in saying there must be some misapprehension upon the point on the part of his colleague." Your lordsnps, then, will at once perceive that while Mr. Allen Is disposed to give ful credit to the denial of the President of the Board of Control, he recognizes in his note the existence of an impression in the mind of Mr. Anderson that a communioation such as I stated passed between him and the right hon. gentleman. Now, how a matter of that nature can be the subject of mere impression I cannot understand. (Hear, hear.) Whether such a communication did or did not take Place ought to be known to Mr. Anderson one way or the other. This, however, my lords, Is the position in which the matter stands at present. It may become the subject of future inquiry * but, e that as it may, I feel bound to give the right hon. entle. man the President of the Board of Control the full benefit of the explanation which has been made by my noble friend opposite in his behalf, and at the same time to express my regret for having made againrm. him a charge which, if true, could not but be in'urious to him as a public man. (Hear, hear.) After what A have said I trust your lordships will be of opinion that I did not make that charge, I will not say without belieiing it to be co.rect-for there would be but little merit in that-hut without acting on such information as justified me in tbinking that the charge was not capable of contradiction. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANYIbLLE.-I felt quits satisfied, my lords, from the very commenzcement of this controversy that my noble friend did not make the statement to which he refers without firmly believing it to be well founded. And after what has fallen from my noble friend this evening, I can quite understand his supposing that he had suffioiently good groundsformaking useof astorywhichmusthavebeentobhi a very tempting one to use in the course of debate. (A laugh.) At the same time I entirely deny that there was any ground whatever for the statement respecting this letter, When the noblp earl oppoesq mi4e tlh9 charge before your lod& hips I sent word to the President of the Board of Control and asked him whether it was true or not. The answer I received was, that it was untrue. Of course, therefore, I contradicted it, but in consequence of the extreme positive. ness of the noble earl's manner, and the positive face he put upon it (a laugh), knowing, too, how often and how easily imistakes and misunderstandings arise, I did not contradict him so deddedly as I might hAve done, bat contented muyself with a simple denial of the charge, and refrained from making any vehement assrtions. Subsequently I saw the President of the Board ef Control, and he told me he had not the slightest recoUection of writing such a letter and receiving suob a reply; that he had questioned his private secretary and the Secretary of the Board of Control with the same result; and that he had put himself in communication with tho Peninsular and Oriental Company on the subject, with what results your lordships are aware. Yet, the gentleman with whose name we are unacquatnted not only informed the noble earl that he hal. reoeived this infot'masion from Mr. Anderson, who ha gone. abvoad, but said he would inquire from another person connected with the company, as to the facts, and returned with the statement that Mr. Allen declared that It was perfectly true. The Earl of DERBY.-I did not say that this gentleman stated that Mr. Allen declared the information to be perfectly true, but that Mr. Allen knew Mr. Anderson lhad made such a statement. Earl GRANVILLE.-It appears to me altogether perfectly impossible that such a letter should have been written, and I beg, therefore, to protest againet the burden being laid on Mr. Vernon Smith of making any further attempts to clear his character. (Hear, hear.) Having sid thus much, I beg to acknowledge most cordially the honoarable manner in w hch the noble earl opposite, not being able to sabztautiate this accusation, and after the decLartion made by my right hon. friend on the subject, has expressed for himself his own feelings on the subject. BANK ISSUES INDEMNITY BILL. On the order of the day for the third reading of this Bill, Lord STANLEY of ALTERLEY said, thelr lordships had been already informed in the Speech from the Throne of the reason why Parliament had been called together at this unusual period of the session and the subject-matter of the Bill of which he was now about to move the third reading. Under these circumstances he would endeavour to state briefly the effect of the law as it at present existed respecting the Bank of England and the currency. Previously to 1844 the Bank of Enuland, the country banks, and the banks of Ireland and Scotland were empowered to issue any amount of notes, without any condition except that of their convertibility into cash. The conse. quence was, that during that period many incon. veniences resulted; great disturbances took place in monetary and commercial affairs. It was felt that an alteration was required, and Sir R. Peel In 1844 introduced that Act which at present go. verned our banking operations. Its main provision was that the Bank of England was restrained from issuing any notes beyond the amount of 14,000,0Q0., except as representing bullion actually in the Bank coffers, and this was afterwards practically extended by the sum of 475,0004 It was hoped that the passing of this measure, affecting the Bank of England and the country banks, would secure us against the recurrenoe of those financial convulsions and crises which had previously existed, would miintain a guarantee for the convertibility of paper into coin, and pre. vent an excess of paper money, with all its injurious consequences. In 1847, however, in consequence (as it was, I believe, generamy admitted) of the great railway speculations at the time, and of the large exports of bullion which took place for the purchase of corn abroad, the state of tho money-market was such that the Government felt it their duty to sanction a departure by the Bank from the Act of 1844 as it affected their issue of paper. The effect of the letter then written by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the First Lord of the Treasury was such that it at once dissipated the panic and restored confidence, and the Bank did not find It necessay to exercise the Drivilege thas conceded to them. But though no indemnity was required, the Government felt that Parliament ought to be caUed together to ask them either to sanction or censure their proceedings. Eere he might perhaps take the opportunity of stating what the opinions of Sir R. Peel were in regard to this Act. Sir BE. eel on that occaion ehowed that, though he considered the Act of 1844 likely to guarantee us against an excess of paper, while at the same time it would insure convertibility, he never thought the Act would prevent a recurrence of those commercial diffioulties and financial crises which must more or less exist on particular occasions in any country where credit existed to the extent it prevailed in this country. These were hisw ords.- "The Miristers were not wild enough to suppose that this measure would prevent all undue speculation, or insure an Invariable paper currency; but there was a species of speculation dependent on an undue issue of paper which they hoped the measure would check. Speoulation could not be prevented in a commercial community, but it might be aggravated by a species of paper credit within the control of arliament; and though Ministers did not aim at check. ing legitimate specnlation-though they admitted they could not prevent illegitimate speculation, which was perhaps necessarily incident to mercantile enterprise, particularly in a country like this, still they asked Parliament, by assenting to this measure, not to a avate evils which it could not control, nor refuse to check those which came properly within its jurisdiction." Sir E. Peel also observed (and this would show the views with which he originally introduced the measure) :- " I say, then, that the Bill of 1844 had a triple object. Its first object was that in which I admit it has failednamely, to prevent, by early and gradual, severe and sudden contraction, and the panic and confusion inseparable from It; but the Bill had two other objects of at least equal importance-the one to maintain and guarantee the converti- ility of the paper currency into gold; the other, to prevent the difficulties which arise at all times from undue speculation being aggravated by the abuse of paper credit in the form of promissory notes. In these two objects my belief is that the BiU has completely succeeded. My belief is that you have had a guarantee for the maintenance of the principle of convertibility, such as you never had before. My belief also is, that whatever difflculIties you are now suffering, from a combination of various causes, those dlffi oulties would have been greatly ravated if yon had not wisely taken the precaution of checking the unlimited issue of the notes of the Bank of England, of joint-stock banks, and private banks."1admgtIpru Such were the opinions of Sir R.. Peel, and most importan they were in considering this question. At the same time Er. Herries moved a resolution which expressed the opinion of the House of Commons, that the course taken by the Govetrnmentof the day was a judicious one. The resolution "That, looking to the state of distress which has for some ume prevailed among the commercial clmases, and to the generas feelng of distrust and alarm by which tho embarrassments of trade have been aggravated, it is the opiion of this House that her Majesty's Ministers were justified, during the recess of Parliament, in recommending to the Bank of England (for the purpose of restoring confidence) a course of proceeding at variance with the restrictions imposed bythe Act ot the 7th aud Sth of Victoria, cap. 32 That this House will resolve Itself into committee upon the said Act." This resolution was ca-ried without a division. Bat a select committee was appointed to inquire into the subject, and in their foft report, dated June, 1848, they said:- " The isue of that letter was no doubt an extraordinary exercise of power on the part of the Government, but the House has decided that In the peculiar circumstances of the period they were justified in taldng that step." since that period their lordships had had full opportunity of observing the effects of the Act. It had completely succeeded in its two essential objects-it had complesely secured the convertibility of the note and it had prevented an over issue of paper. It had not prevented the occurrence of financial crises, but he beheved that it was not within the limits of human legislation to frame any law thatwould effectually prevent such calamities. (Hear) Situated as tcls country was, and having transactions with every part of the world, It was liable to be acted upon either by panice or commercial dissaters occurring in foreign countries, caused by vicious and unwise legisLtion, or other circumstances over which we had no control such, for example, as that which had occurred in Amerlca, where there were unlimited paper Issues unchecked by Government coDtroL and without any Government paper in crculation, and where there had taken place disasters that almost led to the total destruction of commercial relations in that country. (Hear, hear.) Wbat occurrednin Aimerica reacted upon England, a countrywhere there was a well-regulated convertible paper circulation; hut the indauence it exerted was still more terribly felt in Hamburg, where there was a metallic currency, thus showing that not even a purely metallic currency could protect a country from those periodical dis tresses that occasionally occurred. (Rear, hear.) Wtith regard to the recnt orisisn this country he might state that though there were difficulties in obtaining moneythe rates of discount being high-there was nothing In the commercdal position of the country previous to the end of October that at all called upon the Government to take any extraordinary steps. (Hear.) He mentioned this dircUmstance in consequence of what had been said In another place that the Government, possessing a department such as that of the Board of Trade, ought to have foreseen what was aDout to take plac, and should sooner have taken pre- cautinarymeasures. The crisis, the worst part of which he trusted was now over, began with the breaklng of the Borough Bank of Liverpool and the failure of the very large house of Dennistoun and Co., followed up by that of the Western Bank of Scotland, which was engaged in very large transactions. The City of Glasgow Bank also failed, and matters assumed a very serious aspect. The consequence was that on the 11th of November it became necessary for Her Majesty's Govermment to consider what steps should be taken In the monetary condition of the country. (Hear.) Now, if the circumstances of 1847 justified the intervention of the Government of that day, he thought he should be able to show7 from a omparative statement of the condition of the Bank of England in that year with what it was in the present that there was also ample reason for intezfering in November last. In October, 1847, the amount of bullion in the Bank of England was 8,313,000.; in November, 1857, it wa 7,171,0001. In October, 1847, the reserve of notes was 1,547,0001. ; in 1857 957,0001 In 1847 the reserve of coin was 447,600 . ; in 1857 It was 50-1,0001. In 1847 the private deposits amounted to 8,50.0001.; In 1857 they amounted to 12,935 COOL. In 1847 private securities were 19,467,0001. * in 1857 they were 26.113, 0001. It must be obvious to th'eir lordships that if assistance had been refused, and the Bank of 'England had continced to act upon the law, the most prejudicial consequences must have followed t commerce. (Rear, hear.) The Bank, on the 1th of November, had 9a8,0001. of note reserve, whUe on the 12th of November the reserve oi notes was only 131,CDOt., so that the necessary cormnnercial aommodation could nothave been given, and in such cirunmtances he eft istt she imnagigation of ;hetix l9gdmips ,to conceiYO v hat would have been the consequences (Hear, hear.) He did not believe that any Government that could have existed in this country would have ventured to withhold the suspension of the law for 24 hours longer, without pro. ducing irrevocable rnln. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the effect might have been to destroy a villainous system and clear somewhat the commercial atmosphere, but instead of Government now meeting Parlament to get a B01 of Indemaity they would have expsead themselves to the severest oensure. (Hear.) The Bank of England were obliged immediately to act upon the letter of pecmi aon to suspend the law transmitted to them by the Government, but they acted uon it merely technically-that was to say they transferred fom the banking to the ise department 2.000,0001. While saying that they issued this amount in exces he would read a statement whilchwould show that the increased amnount of notes actually in the hands of the public was much below that tum, and that the actual amount of notes in circulation had been very little above what it was before. (Hear.) The amount of notes issued to the public not represented bybulliou on thel3th of November was 186,0001. ; on'the 14th of November, 622.000!.; on the 16th of November, 860.000!.; on the 17th of November, 36.0001 *; on the 18th of November, 852,0001. * on the 19th of November, 896,000!.; on the 20th of November, 928.000! ; on the 21st of November, 617,000!.; or. the 23d of November, 397,0001.; on the 24th of November, 317,0001. ; on the 25th of November, 81,0001.; on the 26th of November, 243,000l.; on the 27th of November, 342,0001.; on the `8th of November, 184,0001.; on the 30th of November, 15,000!, On the lst of December the number of notes was exactly the same a before. (Hear.) Iat night (the 10th of December) the total amount of bullion in the Bank was 8,200,000!., and the reserve of notes 4,650,0001. (Hear, hear.) This beneficlal effect had been produced in no small degree by the Government not having given permision to the Bank to transgrs the law at an earlier period. (Hear, hear.) HIe believed that one of the most important providons of the Act of 3844 was that by which the Bank was enabled to raise the rate of discount whanever the exchanges were goimg against us. On this oocasion and before the Government is3ued their letter the exchange had already taken a turn end the export of gold was checked, while since that time matters had improved and gold was gradually coming in. (Hear, hear.) It would be matter for future consideration how far any future regulation should be made for a relaxation of the provisions of the Act of 1844, but he thought that on no occasion should such relxation be granted unless the exchanges had already turned in our favour, so as to secure tho country against what might prove an aggvation Instead of a diminution of the evil sought to be remedied. The Government had, under the circumstanoes he had mentioned, given its sanction to a departure from the provisions of that Act, and they now asked their Lordships to pass a Bill of Indemnity. In the Bill there was a provision permitting this departure from the Act to continue for 28 day atter the net meeting of Prliauwent, upon the oDndition that the Bank of England should not charge less than 10 per cent, discount; but if during that period the Bank of England should no longer require the protection of the present BIUl to enable it to issue notes, beyond the amount of 14,500,0001., unrepresented by bullion, then It would be no longer required to charge 10 per cent discount, Consequently the Bill was not open to the objection mentioned by the noble earl opposite the other evening. Nor must it be too hastily decided, because the Act of 1844 had been twice departed from, that therefore it was of no value, and might at once be done away with, He thought that experience so far from proving that, only showed that the Act was not able to do that which its original introducers never said it could effect ; but in other respects it had completely succeeded, in guaranteeing for insance, the convertibility of the note and In providing also security againstover issues (Hear.) Heshould therefore regret to think that any person should be disposed to get rid of this law, merely because the Government had, under unavoidable oircumstances, been compeled to depart from a portion of its provisions, Stil, it was well worthy the consideration of the House whether it might be necessary to introduce some new provision with respect to the circamstances and conditions Tinder which such relaxation as had recently taken place should be exercised-whether it should be exercised by the Government on its own responsibility, subject t.o the approval or censure of Parliament, whether it should be effected by some self-operating system, or 'whether the object Ehould be attained by some other means. There were also many other matters in connexion with this subject which might very properly be submitted to consideration, such as the circulation of the Irish and Sootch banks, and how far: their issue of II.-notes had aggravated if not created some of the disasters under which the country had suffered, A noble friend of his had said that it would be desirable to introduce into Scotland the Bank of England note as a legal tender; and to tome extent he believed that such a measure would dimInish the extent of the evil which had been experienced, for immediately on the failure of the Western Bsak oi Scotland all the other banks there sent up to London for gold. The banks in Ireland also sent for gold, and the consequence 'was that at the moment of England's emergency and agony no less than three millions of sovereigns were sent from this oountry. Another point for consideration was how far the stringent publicatiorn of the accounts of the Bank of England might aggervate the evlsB of a crisis These were all matters worthy for grave consideration and inquiry by their lordships, as well as the causes of the late financial cris, and whether the mode in whilch the joint-stock banks had administered their affairs had aggravated the crije, He should be glad to see, when their lord. ships met after the recess a committee of inquiry upon these matters appointed. lie had now stated the reasons which influenced the Government to take the course they had pursued. They felt that if it was a justifiable course to take in 1847, It was much more imperatively called for now, and they believed that by the step they took they averted great disasters. (Hear hear.) They believed that they would not deserve to e in the position in which they had seen plced, if they had not, incurring a great responsibility, done that which they alone could do, and departed from the strict letter of the Act of 1844.

He could not agree to this doctrine. In the first place, he would assert that even with convertibility there might be deprec ation of the currency, No doubt convertibility limited that depreciation in point of degree and time, and if the convertibility were maintained the ultimate restoration of !the currency would be insured. For a short time. howfever. and to a moderate degree a depreciationeof th currency might take place, and, indeed, had taken place contemporaneously with the maintenance of convertibility. He agreed with his noble friend near him that the suspension of the Act had caused a virtual alteration in the value of monev. Admit- ting however, that any depreciation that could tako place so long. as the prindple of convertibiity was maintained, must be moderate in de5gree and limited in point of time, he wished to ask their lordships what assurance they could have that they would be able to maintain that cornvertibility ? His noble friend near him had stated that it would have been imposdble for the Government to take the course of suspending the Act of 1844 if the exchange h3d not been in a favoble con. dition. If there had been an adverse state of the exchanges and if more paper had been issued, there would have been a drain upon the Bank which would have exhausted Its last sovereign. But when the commercial world were told that in all their diDiculties they were to look for relief, not to the ordinary issue of paper provided by law, but to an extraordinary creationx of Bank paper, did their lordships think that commercial men would ho long content to forego that relief if a ruriod of great pressure arrived whenthe exchanges were not in a favourableposition? But then their lordships were told that convertibility was only an abstract principle, that an abstract principle must not be allowed to stand in the way of the necessities of the nation, that we must not let other nations enter into our consideration, and that we must protect ourselves. The very same arguments which were used on this occasion to induce the Government to suspend the operation of the Act of .-1844 might be brought forward in favour of a suspension of cash payments. If Parliament allowed it to be considered a settled principle of our policy that relief should be given byan issue of paper they could not hope that many years woWld pass over their heads without a suspension of cash pMrmeuir Let their lordships see bv what few and easy seps they gitight arrive Atthat giusp9esio4 13uppose the presue aOe,' great And the exchanges not unfavorable. There rwould then be a cry that the coantry want,ed money, and ther% wrould bo an ISue of Bank psaper. But suppose that after that issne of paper h takha place circemstance. should arise which ehoult cause an alteration in the exchanges, and that a drain of gold should commence. Depend upon it they were taking the first step in the dowaward path of a saspenson of sah payments when they allowed paper to be isned arbitrarily and at the discretion of any party. Let them rely npon It, tbey were embarking ma corse every step inm ich was easier than thAt which went before, and a very few steps in which would lead them to a suspension of cah payments. It was now universally admitted that when a spension of cash payments took place in 1797 It waimposible to avold it. By previous imprudence the country bhd been brought to a situatlon in which no other cooune remained-when either the Bank ofEDgland mut top, or must pay awa its last sovereign. Had their lordshipa forgotten tho atat effect of that saupension? They aU knew that for a time It did not produce any, serious results, but they also kne that the country, having once em. barked in the fatal course oE Issuing paper money which was not convertible into gold, ws tempted to abuse that power. Men wero found to contend then, as they contended now, that when they had good bills they bad a right to have them discounted. (" Bear," and a lUugh.) Little by little our currenoy dimininshed in value unti a guinea came to be worth 27s. or 28s., and even more. For a Beries of yeas a grievous injustice wa committed UpOn all creditors and persons hasvinR fixed incomes, and when the nation awoke to a sense of its impropriety and began to retracoe it stepP, what happened? It was found that those who had suffered from the original Injustice very seldom or ever benefited by the tardy justice afterwards conoeded; while onthe other hund, during the yearsof depreciated currency, an Immense multitude of trasactions hbad taken place In which the country, as wel as private individuals, had in. curred very hervy obligations. The landed Interest more especialy, having made grat efforts to meet the demand for corn, had borrowed money for gricultural improvements, and they found that they had to pay 20s. for every 15., or 16s. they had borrowed. The national debt waa increased in the same degree. Thus% fresh and most grio-rous Injustie was committed whencash payments were resumed, and the nation was saffering to this day and would fuffer to the latest hourof its existence from the effects of these lasmen. table blunders Ought not this expeorence to be a warning and ought It not to teach us that If the currency were de, preciated, results which no one intended or contemplated would follow one after another, until the country would be unable to right itself? If ever their lordship. were doomed to see a supendon of cash paments it was by such a road as he had pointed out tat itwould be arrived fat. He uaked whether they ought to leave that road open for future Mlnisters and futume Bank directors by passng this Bll and nglecting to adopt some efficient memas forreformingoursteof currency. Howwasthatreformtobeeffected? Be had no heitation in expressing his belief that it ws to be accomplished by carrying out to it. legitimate conclusion the sound principle of the Act of 1844. As he understood that Act, its principle was this-that a paper currency ougt to beassimlLtedasfar as possible to A metallic currency. It was ssumed, and ustly assumed, that while a paper circulation had great advantages in the way of convenienoe and economy, i point] of uniformity of value a metallic currency vas supenor to any other; and also that the value of a currency, whether paper or metallic, depended in the first instance on Its amount in proportion to the transactions which were carried on. That being the case, It wa aumed that In order to make a paper currency resemble a metallic currency Its amount should be made tovary according to the ving wants of the country, precisely by the same la whlch determined the amount of a metallic currency. It was also believed that the uniformity advalvue of ametaDlic currency arose from the circumstance that it was imposible arbitrarfly to limit Its amount, and therefore, from that consideration, It was held that the only way in which we could secure a paper currency as nearly a possible of uniform velue was to place it under such regulations that itS amount at any time should vary by the operation of the same causes which affected gold. It was provided that whenever the paper currency reached a certain fixed sum, far below the wants of the country, it should only ba issued beyond that amount in exohange for gold, while, on the other hand, the paper should at al times be convertible into gold. But, while that, provision was perfectly sound in principle, the Act of 1844 unfortunately was defective in the machinery by which It sought to acomplish the object in view. It still left the is8ue of paper money in the hands of the Bank of England and of other banks in different parts of the kingdom. The result was that great mischief was occasioned, chiefly by keeping up a false impression in the public mind, that, as the Bank of England in particular had a monopoly almost In the right of issuing paper, in return for that advantage they afforded a certain amount of assistanoe to seen engaged in commercial pursnits. It led such people to believe that, as the dealers mn money were also allowed to be the issuers of maoney, their transactions might be carried on in such a manner as that they might always look for assistance from that quarter on an emergency; and to that, he believed, was to be attributed much of the present commerclal distress He would not attempt to follow up that topic in the manner he could have wished, and would content himself by saying that, asthe principle of the Act of 1844 was to assmilate a paper currency to a metallic currency, it seemed to him that the first thing that ought to have been done was to assimite the two in the authority by which they were Issmed. The LegiWsature allowed no money to be issned by trading persons; there was a Royal Mint only, which was open to all persons who chose to carry gold there to be colned. But to coin paper money was intinitely more dangerous than to coin gold; and, therefore, to carry out the principle of assimilation, what he would recommend was that they should put an end to all issue by the Bank of England and by the joint-stock banks in Scotland and Ireland, and have one uniform currency issued by public anthority in the manner suggested by the petition which had been presented that evening in their lordshipsa House from the Bristol Chamber of Commerce. Let them establish that principle and they would do much to prevent the recurrence of a great many or the commercl evils from which the country now periodically suffered. Having provided that paper should only be issued by public authority and in exchange for gold, they were at once at liberty to relieve the Bank from all restrictione, and the Government of the day from the necessity of relaxing those restrictions in times of severe pressure, which were so justly calculated to excite alarm in the public mind. He would only add that, whoever the directors of the cur renoy were, they should be appointed by the Crown, but should hold their offices, lke the judges, during good behaviour. If he were asked whether that system wonld prevent tho recurrence of periods of commercial distress, and, If not, whether It would be safe to bind the Government so strictly that even in themost aggravated cases of commercial distress they should not be at liberty to adopt the usual ex: pedient for Its relief which had been found twice so efr6cacious, his reply would be that it did not appear to him that the present oommercial depressoon was due to the laws affecing the currency; on the contrary, he believed it had arisen from that restless spirit of speculation which animated the commercial world, and from the abuse of credit which had taken place in this and other countries, and which he could not help thinking our recent legislation had been calculated to foster He believed that in the long run it would be found that the interference of Government and public authority to support commercial credit would be found to do more harm than god. But,even grantedthat it might be of some value, and that it was right to recognize the principle that for extraordinary emergencies some extraordinary provisions must be m ade, still, even in that case it was clear that the only mode in which the assistance of the Government could be usefnUy imparted was by applylng the resources and credit of the State in aid of the credit of individuals. No Government could create additional property ; all it could do was to transfer whatever there was from one hand to aother. If that kind of assistance was to be given, it shoulA be givendirectly, and not indirectly,by authorizing the Bank to make extraordinary advanos or to issue more paper. It would be better to authorize the Government under special circumstances to issue stock or Exchequer bills, as was done in the revolutionar war. He believed that durng the present distress therenhad never been ny difficulty inraising money upon stock at a time when hill could not be dis counted, which showed that there was plenty of money in the country, but that bills had become discredited. He hoped that some such stop would be taken in future,instead of tampering with the standard of value ; for the extraordinary issRe of paper money not based upon bullion was, after all, only in a different form, the old resource of barbarous and ignorant rulers, the debasement of the curreny. It was just as well to coin little sovereigns as to authorize an issue of paper not based upon bullion. There was another and important point to which he wished to advert, but which it was not possible upon the present ocasion fully to enter upon. His conviction, which he had aved at many years ago, was, that the prohibition of the issue ot smalU notes in this country was a most injudicious measure. He could see no reason why, if paper could be usefully and safely employed for large sums. t should not be used also for small amounts; and he had never heard any aument against the use of IL-notes which did not equally apply to 51. and 101. notes. The present was not the occasion to discuss that subject, or he Rh-ud -+ AespairV or neing able t covic the Ho sta sholtUd not despair of being able t convince the H Iouse that the issue of 11.-notes would, instead of rendering the currency insecure, tend to make it more secure than it was at present - and If it could be done with safety it was manifest that ft could be done with advantage. They would get rid of the anomaly which permitted 1.-notes to circulate in Scotland and Ireland, but prohibited them in England,-a law which was quite disregarded in the border counties, where Scotch U.-notes were In constant circulation, and upon a late occasion he found himself the holder of some Western Bank-notes. ("Hear," and laughter.) Another advantage which woald arise from the issue of lt.-notes was that it would faciitate a change to which he had already adverted, and would enable us to have one national currency instead of several currencies managed by several trading corporations. If thore had been one national currency the country would not have been exposed to the great inconvenienco which It hadlately suffered, arisdng from the great and sudden demand for gold for Ireland and Scotland. By the issue of 1. notes sensible relief would be afforded to the Country at a time when relief was most needed. Although he beieved the present distress had been brought about by great imprudence there could be no doubt but It vas a disaster whlcli pressed heavly not alone on those whose imprudence had caused it, but also upon all othor classes of the communnty. They saw that large number of workmen were thrown out of employ-that the whole course of trade was affected, and yet they knew that the real wealth of the country was perfectly untouched. There could be no doubt but that an isune at the present moment of IL- notes would be of very eat advantage. That paper would displac 30,000,000 or mi.l00, lions of soveregns, aud there would be an addition to the national capibtl of a large proportion of those sovereigns. He thought that was a reason why this subject should be taken up by the Government, and that without waiting for further inquiry they should at oncoe introduce some measure for the consideration of Parliament. He would not now enter further upon thts important aud difficult subject; but he must impress upon the Government the necessity for considering itduring the approachingreces and of being prepared i'hen Parliament shall reassemble to bring forward some measure upou thei.r own reeponsi- Eity. (Hear, bear.) He thonght inquirato the cause of the present distrems might be useful bat he did not thtanl it was n=oesary to makke any further Inquiry into the tate of the currency. (Rear, hear.)

On the motion of Sir W.JOLLIFFZ, a now writ was ordere& to isnue for the borough of Whitehaven, in consequence ofthe death of Mr. Hildyard, THE CLEANSING OF THE THAMES. Mr. LAUIE asked the First Commissioner of Worksg whether any, and, if so, what steps had been taken for thepurpose of carrying out so much of the Act 18th and 19th. Victoria, cap. 120, as relates to the main drainage of themetropolis, Sir B. HALL.-As this is a subject of considerable im. pottance, perhaps I may be allowed to answer the questiom. at some length, and to Inform the House of the various proceedin8s which have taken place in relation to the mattersince the Act ws passed in 1855. Towards the close of the wssion of that year the Metropolitan Act was pawed, and& under the 135th section it is declared that the Metropolitam Board shall make such sewers and works as they shall think necessary for preventing all or any part of the sewa of the metropolis flowing or passing into the riverThames. The clause goes on to say that in case of sewers being constructed they shall be covered and kept so as not to be injurous to bealth; and under the pro- isions of the next section, the 136th, it is required that before any works are commenosd plans sball be submitted& to the First Commiss1oner of Works for the time being, and such works shall not be proceeded with until the plans havy receved his approvaL That Act was passed In August, 1855, and on the 3d of June, 1856, a deputation from the Metro, politan Board waited on me with a plan for the main drainage of the metropolis, as I supposed, in conformity with the spirit and intention of the Act. I told them the plan should have immediate attention, but before giving any posi. tive decision I desired to have a report on the flow of the, tide in the river, which I had directed Captain Bursthl tomake. Captain BursW's reportwas sentme outhelstol July, and on the 3d I forwarded a copy to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and informed them that I could not accept their plan for reasons which I stated in a letter, concluding as follows:- " By the Metropolis Act of 1855 it is provided that ' The Metropolitan Board of Works sholi make sewers and works for preventing al or any part of the sewage within the metropoli from flowinR or passing into the Thames in or near the metropolis.' But the scheme submitted for the approval of the First Commissioner actually provides that tne sewage shall flow Into the Thames at a point withia the metropolis. It consequently follows that before sucCh scheme can be carried out it will be necessary to c upo. Parliament to repeal so much of the Act of last session as provides for the purification of the river Thames within the metropolis. The Fist Commissioner feels that he cannot undertake to do this, and, considering that the scheme is entirely at vsrianoe with the intentions of the Legislature, as set forth in the Act which passed last August, he con. siders it to be his duty to return the plans which were sabmitted for his approval." On the 5th of November last year a second plan was su.bmitted having an outfall on both sides, just outside the metropolitan area, the consequence of which would have been that the sewage would have flowed back with the tideinto the metropolitan area. I felt bound to return that plan also, The two plans which they presented 'were wholly at varianco with the spirit and intent of the Act and with the plain intention of the Legislature. In the meantime I had desired Captain Burstal to point out to me the nearest points. at which the sewage of the metropolis could be discharged without reflowing into the metropolitan area, and having received that report from Captain Burstal I suggested to the Board that it would be desirable to have a conference. The conference took place on the 20th of Noversber. I told them that Captain Burstal had reported to me that the nearest points at which the sewage could be dischaiged& without returning with the tide to the metropolis was at Rainham creek on the north, and one mUe above the town of Erith on the south; and that if they submitted plans having those outfalls I should be satisfied, so far as the points of outfall were concerned, inasmuch as it wvould meet the provisions of the statute and the actual requirements of ther metropolis. On the 22d of December the Board presented to me a third plan having outfalls at the points suggested by Captain Burstal,Snd, seeing that teylhadsso far complied' with the terms of the Act, I put myself in communication with some of the most eminent engineers in the kingdom. I selected Messrs. Simpson and Blacvell and Captain Galton to report upon the plan, and I gave directionsto tbese gentlemen to ccusider the lan submitted, ubt not toconfine themselves to tha' plan. Of whed them to consider the whole subject, and If they could devise any scheme for the main drainage better calculated im their judgmeRt to carry out the object to be attained they were to lay that scheme before me. That was on the 31st of December, 1856. I am anxlous tolay the exact dates before the House, to show that not a single day's unnecessary delay has occurred im the office over which I have the honour to preside. On the 31st of July these gentlemen sent in their report. and the eame day I presented a copy of it to the House. L also sent a copy on the same day to tho Metropolitan Board, and I told them that I hoped they would think the plan worth consideration, as it emanated from men so eminent in their profession, and I returned their plan as not approved. But mRy disapproval was not based on the ground that the outfalls were at the points indicated on the plan. On the 5th of last month the Metropolitan Board directed their chairman, secretary, and engineer to wait upon me in regard. to the rejection of their last plan. The chairman sated that the Boardprincipally objected to the scheme of the referees on three grounds :-1st. That the main sewers near the outfall were not covered ; 2d. That the outfall was extended to Sea Reach, and, consequently, beyond the points indicated by Captain Bursal near Erith. 3d. That the ares of drailnage as extended beyond the metropolis. With regard to the first objection, I stated that I quite agreedu that it was desirable tho main sewer should be covered, and there was an end of that objection, With re- ard to the second, I said that the referees conceived rers Pteach to be the best point of outfall, and the chairman acquiesced, saying, "It is impossible to deny that SeaReach is the best point of outfall." With regard to the third objection the difference between us was this, and I think the House will be opinion that I am right :-By .he Act it is declared that they shall make such sewers as will not allow the sewage of the metropolis to pass again into the metropolitan area; and what they contend for Is, that when they have disposed of the sewage of the metropoUltan saea they have complied with that requirement, and that they are not bound to carry away the sewage created out ot the metropolitan area, although that sewage would pasn through their sewers into the Thames again. I say that never could have been the lntention of the Legislature or the true meaning of the Act, and thatc it Is their duty to intercept all sewage which would otherwise flow into the Thames within the metroPolltan area. In this way the matter stands, and I hope the Houee will be of opinion that I have properly exercised the powers which were Intrusted to me. (Hear, hear.) General CODRIN-GTON asked whether it were true that. the First Commissioner would not sanction any outfall within Sea Reach? Sir B. HALL-I am quite aware that such a report hsa been industriously circulated, but there is not one word ofE truth in it. I have stated that I sballbe satisfied if ther make the outfalls at the points indicated bh Captain Bur- taL Ifeltitto be my duty to inform theBoard that. if they attempted to carry out the outfall near Erilth there were difficulties to be overcome, that was a matter for their consideration. But if the Board re prepared to meet those difficulties I shall leave them to be got oveby the Board, THE SUEZ CANAL. Mr. GRIFFITE gave notice that immodiately after th,e recess he should ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether It had oome to the knowledge of the Government that ML Thonvenel, the French Ambassador at Constantinople, or any other diplomatic agent of the French Goven- ment, had been directed to apply to the Porte for a ftrman to anthorize the carrying out of the projet for cnutinz a canal through the Isthmus of Suez; and, also, whetber Hret Majesty's Government were of opinion that the traq

LONDON, SATURDAY, DECEMBEB , i2,1857. In the House of Lords, In answer to a question by Lord SHArT;sBURY, Lord CLARENDON said that a contract had been entered into by the French Government and a certain firm for the supply of negroes to the French colonies, on the condition that it was to be bond lde a free immigration. A similar experiment had been tried by this country 16 years ago, but had failed. HER MAJESTY'r'S Government were alive to the dangers of any such scheme, and had felt it their duty to bring the matter under the notice of the French Government, which had promised to take the subject into their serious consideration. Lord DERBY did not doubt the sincerity of the French Government when they stated their belief that in sanctioning the system proposed by them they had no idea of a revival of the slave trade, but his conviction was that, surround it with what safeguards they might, it would be impossible to prevent abuses, and that the French Government were deceiving themselves if they did not perceive that the mAuatenance of the system was identical in substance, if not in form, with the slave trade iteelf. Lord GREY expressed a hope that if, unhappily, the result of the correspondence with France on this subject should be unsatisfactory, the whole of the proceedings would be published and submitted to the judgment of the civilized world. In his opinion, this was a moment when especial care should be taken to prevent so iniquitous a scheme as tbat wbich was said to be set on foot from being carried into execution. After a few words of explanation between Lord DERBY anid Lord GRANVILT.E, in reference to a statement made by Lord DERBY on the opening night of the session with reference to a etrtain letter alleged to bave been written to the Peninsular and Oiiental Company by the PRESIDDENT of the BoARD of CONTROL, which appeared to be an tntire misrepresertation, Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY moved the third reading of the Bank Issues Indemnity Bill, in doing which he entered into a statement of the circumnstanoes which led to the enactment of the Act of 184 ; of the suspension of that Act in 1847; and of the circumxtances whicll had recently induced HER AiJESTY'S Governmea; again to suspend the operation of the Act. The Act of 1844 had completely sucoeeded in its two essential objects-the convertibility of the banknote into gold, and the prevention of the over issue of paper money. It had not, however, prevented tne occurrence of monetay crises, nor did he believe it was within the limits of human legislation to frame any law that would prevent such calamities. It had been said that Govermmeat ought to bave foreseen what was about to take place and should sooner have taken precautionary, measue, bat there was nothing in the commercial position of the country previous to the end of October vhich at all called upon the Government to take any extraordinary steps. But what subsequeatly occurred made it the imperative duty of the Goverment to interfere. If asistace had been refused the most prejudicial consequences must have fol. lowed. The noble lord entered into a statement of figures with a view to show that, notwithstanding the suspension of the law, the actual amount of notes in circulation was very little above what it was before the Goverrment letter was written. On the 10th of this month the total amount of bullion in the Bank was 8,200,0001., and the reserve of notes, 4,650,001. This beneficial eflect he attributed to the fact of Government not having given permission to the Bank to transgress the law at an earlier period. It would be matter for future consideration how far any relaxation should be made in the provision3 of the Act of 1844; but he thought that on no occasion sbould such relaxation be granted unles the exchanges were turned in favour of this country He should regret any alteration of the present law merely because circumstances had compelled a partial departure from its provisions ; at the same time it was worthy the consideration of Parliament whether it might not be necessary to introduoe some new provision with respect to the conditions under which such relaxation should be exeresid. He should be glad, after the recess, to see a committee of inquiry upon these matters appointed. Lord Grmy, while agreeing to the Bill, thought it necessary to call their Lordships' serious attention to the unsatisfactory state in which the law relating to the currency would be left if the present measure were not followed up by further legislation. By this measure the Act of 1844 was virtually repealed. But he warned their Lordships against saci'doning the principle that in periods of commercial distress the country might look for relief to an issue of paper money, regulated by no certain principle, and limited only by the discretion of the i5suers and the wants of the borrowers. lf Parliament allowed it to be consddered a settled principle that relief ahould be given by an issue of paper, many years could not pass without a suspension of cash payments, the fatal effects of which the noble earl traced from the history of the consequences of the suspension of cash payments in 1797. To prevent the possible recurrence of these evils the sound principle of the Act of 1844 ought to be carried out to its legitimate conclusion. The machinery, however, of the Act was defective. It left the issue of paper money in the hands of the Bank of England and of other banks. As the principle of the Act of 1844 was to assimilate a paper currency to a metallic currency, the first thing to be done was to assimilate the two in the authority by which they were isued. No money was allowed to be issued by trading persons, but to coin paper money was infinitely more dangerous than to coin gold ; what he therefore would recommend was that an end should be put to all issue by the Bank of E'ngland and bythe joint-stock banks in Scotland and Ireland andthat one uniform currency should be issued by public authority. By the establishment of that principle the recurrence of many commercial evils would be prevented. His Lordship considered the prohibition of the issue of small notes in this country a most injudicious measure. The issue of 1l.-notes, instead of rendering the currency insecure, would, in his opinion, tend to make it more secure than at present. S3uch an issue would displace 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of sovereigns, which would cause a large addition to the capital of the country. The Bill was then read a third time and passed. In the House of Commons, among the questions put by various members, Mr. A. inLiS inquired -whether the attention of the Government had been called to the question of transporting a certain number of the mautineers in India to such of our colonies as were willing to receive them. Mr. V. SmsrrH replied that their attention had been directed to the subject; that the object was a desirable one, but it was a very difficult and delicate matter. Mr. WISE asked wvhy the Government had declined to preeent to HER MAJsTjy the memorial from the British inhabitants at Calcutta. Lord PATMxinsToN said the rule was, if any complaint was made against a Governor abroad, that the memorial should be transmitted through the Governor, with bis observations, in order that the Government at bome should be in posssion of the whole matter. He had thought it his duty, tberefore, to return the memorial in question to those who had forwarded it. Mr. Hounisi inquired whether it was true that the Eing of DXTui had received a promise that his life should be spared, and, if so, the reason and the authority. M Mr. V. S-rim said orders had been given for the trial of the King, but, as Captain RoDsoN, at the time of his arrest, did promise him his life, it was impossible to depart from that pledge. The CHANCFLLOR of the Excaraquuu, in moving the postponement of the order for going into a Committee of Supply until the 5th of February, stated that the Government proposed to advance the sum of 5,0001. from the civil contingencies, to be hereafter voted by the House, for the expedition of Dr. I[VINGSTOXE into the interior of Africa. Lord PALaIEToSrON, in intimating his intention to move the postponement of the order for the committal of Sir Hm;py HAELoCaR's Annuity Bill, stated that the Government proposed to give effect to the wishes of the House, and to extend the annuity to two lives, instead of one. A fresh resolution would therefore be required. Mr. S. FITZGRALD complained that sufficient energy had not been exerted by the Government in sending troops overland to India-than which, he eaid, nothing could be easier-whereby they might have arrived at the scene of action a month earlier than they did, and the course of events might then have been different. Mr.V. S:rimm justified the conduct of the Government, and insisted that, taking into consideration the difficulties to be encountered, the negotiations and previous arraDgements required, there had been no loFs of tine, while the health of the troops had been better secured by a sea voyage. He explained likewise the reasons why sailing vessels had been employed in their conveyance, jnstead of screw stea-mers. Sir J. PAxaoTor was of opinion that HER MAJESTy's Government were deeply responsible for their supineness and neglect in not sending military succours to India at an earlier period, sufficient warning having been given them. After a discussion of some length, embracing a variety of topics, the motion for postponing the two orders of the day was agreed to. Sir C. WOOD read a telegram of intelligence from Bombay to the 17th of November. The CHANCELLOR of the EXmCEQUER, in moving for the re-appointment of the select committee to inquire into the operations of the Bank Act of 1844. and of the Bank Acts for Ireland and Scotland of 18X5, observed that, on introducing the Bank Indemnity Bill, he had expressed a confident belief that the crisis was passing away, and this conviction was confirmed by the present conditlon of the bullion and reserve in the 13ank. On the 11th of November the amount of bullion was 6,666,0001., On Thursday night itwas8,200,0001.; thereserve in the banking department, which on the 11th of November was 1,462,00I., on Thursday night amounted to 4,650,000. He then adverted to the resolution of wbich notice had been given by Mr. DISRAELI, that " no fuirther inquiry is necessary into the operation of the Bnk Act of 3844." If it had not been for the late commercial crisis, he should be prepared, he maid, to assent to this resolution, so far as the Bank of England was concerned. But the effect of the resolution would be to preclude the committee of last session from coming to a conclusion as to the evidence already taken, and as to the provincial banks of issue and te Irish and Scotch 1canko. it altogether
Happily the anxiety caused by the late intelligence from India has not been of long duration. Another series of telegrams reached us yesterday with news from Bombay up to the 1 th of November. The accoants, we are most happy to say, are extremely favourable. During this long contest the alternations of joy and sorrow have been frequent and severe; from them we may form some notion of the anxieties suffered by less fortunately situated communities, when the tide of war bursts over their frontier, and victory is not only a matter of greatness or glory, but involves the Bafe.y of every household. Never since the first NAPOLEON encamped on the coast of Picardy has this country been so nearly touched in all that it holds dear as by the present mutiny. It will, then, not be out of place if we congratulate the public on having surmounted the last of the dangers which threatened British power and a band of British soldiers in the East. Of course, we speak only as far as a judgment can be formed from the intelligence transmitted from the seat of war. It may be that the great movement of troops -;hich we report has been subsequently delayed by unforeseen causes, and that the country may be premature in giving vent to its satisfaction; but, if no miscalculation has taken place, it seems likely that a month since Lucknow was relieved, and the final destruction of the rebel army commenced in Oude and the adjacent country. The position of things as described in the late despatches was as follows :-Generals OUTRAM and HAVELOCK were in Lucknow with some 1,400 effective men, besides the women and children of the Residency. Some 500 men wvith a number of s:ck and wounded and all the baggage were at Alunibagh, three miles short of the town. Lucknow itself was surrounded by the enemy and unable to communicate even with Alumbagh, while as far as the latter place the road was quite open from Cawnpore, and more than one convoy of provisions had lately entered. The great anxiezy wvas, of course, for the safety of the unfortunate garrison at Lucknow; as for the speedy destruction of the enemy, no one in the Presidency felt the slightest doub' about it, and there was rather a feeling of joy that from Gwalior and Delhi, and other quarters, the whole crew were congregating in one spot, where they might be crushed at a blow. WVe now learn that the military news brought by the extra steamer was perfectly correct. Sir COLIN CAMPBELL reached Cawnpore on the 3d or 4th of November. It appears certain from our own telegram that the Commander-in-Chief actually crossed the Ganges and commenced his march on Lucknow on the 10th. His force Is variously stated at from 1,500 to 5,000 men; but it is probable that Sir Coti_x has pushed on with the smaller niumber, and that the rest would join him at Alumbagh in a few days after. In such an emergency it cannot be thought that the Commander-inChief would take more than four days on the march, and we may therefore expect that on the 13th or 14th he would come upon the enemy, who had, no doubt, made preparations to receive him in the plain which divides Alumbagh from the city. Some mails back mention was made of a canal which crossed this plain, and it was said that as soon as General HAvELocx got over the bridge on his way to Lucknow it was broken down. This manceuvre seemed to intimate that the canal would be defended against the advance of an enemy, and it is quite possible that here the first struggle between our newlyarrived troops and the enemy has taken place. We may, however, take it for granted that Sir CO3:NT CAMPBELL has made his way to the city, and was strong enough to fight through it with less comparative loss than HAVELOCK and OUTRAIM. But the force with the Commander-in-Chief is not the only one which was advancing to the rescue. Colonel GREATHED'S column, after marching about 140 miles, gaining two considerable victories, and worsting the enemy in four or five smaller encounters, had arrived at Cawnpore on the 26th of October. On the 18th of November Brigadier GRANT, of the 9th Laacers, had taken the command as senior officer, and five days later the force had inflicted a severe defeat on the enemy, capturing five guns. On the 31st it marched on Lucknow, with, as it seems, reinforcements that made it up to about 5,000 men. It occupied Alumbagh, and, having taken with it a large supply of provisions, awaited the arrival of the Commander-in-Chief. It thus appears that by the middle of November the force that had reached Lucknow must have amounted to 10,000 men. Supposing the Residency and Alumbagh garrisons to have numbered 1,500 more, bebween 11,000 and 12,000 men might have been brought into the field. Those who remember the tales of Assaye and Meeanee, or even go no further back than the events of the present year, wiU readily believe that such a force will easily have vanquished any number of treacherous Sepoys who may have dared to oppoee it. That Lucknow was relieved at the time we mention, and that those who have been exposed to nearly six montha of hourly peril are now in safety, is what we may without presumption hope. From the rest of India the accounts are equally satisfactory, The country was settling down, and t,e cause of the mutineers was evidently felt to be hopeless. The disquiet in Saugor and Jubbulpore can scarcely be considered as contradicting this opinion. The region in which these places are situated has the closest relations with the mutineers, and muat remain in a ferment until they have been completely dispersed. Rajpootana, Malwa, and Bundelcund will be troublesome just as long as NANA SAnriB and his comrades keep the field, and no longer. The disturbances appear to be quite sporadic, and to threaten no serious danger. We are, however, glad to see that some of the detached bands have received severe chastiBement. The defeat of the Dinapore mutineers by Colonel PowXL, with a detachment of the 93d Hlighlanders and the Naval Brigade, appears to have been a brilliant affair, since we must suppode that the enemy far outnumbered the strangely compounded little force which worsted them. Unhappily the success was clouded by the faU of the officer in command. The outbreak at Mehidpore seem3 to have been speedily suppressed. This place, the scene of the great battle in 181W in which the power of HoxAR was broken by Sir JoN MALCOLM, was attaked by abody of insurgent tribes joined by a portion of the Malwa Contingent. Several officers were killed and the troops forced to retire. But the triumph was soon to end. On the 12th of November the rear guard of the rebels was attacked by a force of the NIZAfS cavalry, and the whole of the guns and stores from Mehidpore retaken, with two of the enemy's guns. But we cannot help considering these affairs as of merely secondary importance. It is, of coiuse, necesary to make head against the rebels wherever they appear, and these actions give evidence that everywhere the activity and courage of our officers may be relied upon. But the chief thing to be done is to get the newly-arrived reinforcements up the country and to crush the main army of the rebels in Oude. When that is done the spirit of disaffection in other parts will quickly pass away.
When the House of Commons was aslred to affirm the proposition that no inquiry into the currency was any longer necessary, the result could not be doubtful. The question could only be answered by inquiring Into the present state of the controversy. By extending the functions of the proposed committee the CHcALmoi of the ExcnEQuER left Mr. DIsiAnLi without any solid ground of objection. It may be true that all posaible opinions about the Bank issues have already been published, but it would be absurd to deny that the causes of the recent commercial crisi deserve investigation, and it would be difficult to carry on the discussion without reference to the currency. Some experience also has been gained since the commencement of the inquiry. The panic of 1857 must have thrown a new light on commercial and monetary theories. It is impossible that the partisans of all the conflicting sects can be equally justified in their appeals to the events which have practically illustrated the truth or falsehood of their various prophecies. If there had been no other argument in favour of the reappointment of the committee, it is sufiicient to say that any definite legislation would at present be premature. Parliament is agreed on the necessity of maintaining the convertibility of bank-notes, but as to the best method of effecting this common purpose there is still a wide difference of opinion. The principle of the existing law will ultimately approve itself to all reasonable minds; but in the meantime no Act of Parliament can finaUy put a atop to the currency agitation. Mrr. DIsRAs m must be well aware that his own denunciations of the Act of 1844 prove that the question is still unsettled. The great majority of financiers and economists believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is not enough to make a note payable on demand, without providing some security that it shaU actually be paid. The present law has reduced convertibility to a mechanical certainty. Mvr. DisRAEIu would make It dependent 'n a dogma which he has caught up during his attendance at the Bank Committee. Some of the witnesses, and some of the members who examined them, undoubtedly declared that it was impossible to put out an excessive supply of notes legally exchangeable for gold. It is not worth while to go over the answers in detail, but no one can pretend that there is not an answer, consisting of facts and arguments which satisfy the judgment of those, at least, who bring them forward. If the immutable principles of trade could have the same effect with a compulsory limitation, the Act must be rather superfluous than mischievous. The leader of a minority is generally in a false position when he takes issue on the fitness of an immediate decision. If he succeeds in forcing on legislation he only fixes and perpetuates his own defeat. The CHsNcExLon of the EXCHmQuER very judiciously abstains from affecting a confidence which, under the circumstances, it is impossible for him to feeL Having just passed through the House of Commons an Indemnity Bil for an exceptional measure, he cannot deny that an anomaly exists, and that it would be desirable to find a remedy. If he followed Mr. DIs1tAELT's example, he would propose a resolution that it is desirable to lay down a fixed rule for occasional modifications of the law of issue. Sir C. LEwIs, however, is more modest, and at the same time more logical. He cannot but perceive that a power of relaxation vested il. the Bank would be equivalent to a withdrawal of aU restriction, and that a law which periodically suspends itself is no law at all. If the discretion is intrusted to the Government, there would be no practical change in the present system. At the same time, if the House thinks Ministerial interference unconstitutional, the CHKNcErLOR of the ExCHEiQuI, like a prudent man, is willing to arrive by a more regular highway at his journey's end. Uncertainty is far less impressive than dogmatism ; but there are occasions on which it is more natural and appropriate. The question immediately before the House was whether Parliament and the country had finally solved the currency problem. M;Ir. DIsRAELI, in maintaining the affirmative, necessarily found himself in opposition, not merely to the supporters of the Act of 1844, but to the collective uncertainty of the House of Commons. About the same time Lord GREyv was propoundiag in the House of Lords a scheme which would furnish abundant materials for renewed discussion. The right of coinage, he said, had always been considered a prerogative of the State, and the power of creating paper money was more important and more dangerous than the conversion of bullion into coin. The Bank ought, according to this theory, to be deprived of the privilege of issue, so that the Government might regulate the circulation according to the wants of the country. Lord GRE9 further recommended an issue of small notes-an addition to the available capital of the coumtry which would be dearly purchabed by the additional risk of a suspension of specie payments. A Government issue of notes must either ba intrusted to official discretion or regulated, like the present circulation, by positive law. The Act of 1844, if it were maintained, would press as stringently on the Treasury as on the Bank Directors. On the other hand, a power of relaxation vested in the Minister of the day would be more easily exercised than the extraordinary intervention which has now been sanctioned by Par:iament. Any proposal of Lord GREY's is outitled to 0eriouM attention; but hi4 speech ig quite inconsistent with the assertion that there is no room for further inquiry. There is some ground for Mr. GLADSTONS'S fear that the Committee when it reassembles will once more plunge into the depths of the currency question. The border-land between science and practical business is to some minds strangely fascinating, and the discusion, which to ordinary readers seems intolerably dry, absorbs the interest of adepts, like a game at chesa or an ingenious puzzle. It will be the duty of the leading members of the Committee to impress on their colleagues the impossibility of saying anything new on the subject of bank-notes. The. advantages of a mixed circulation varying as if it were exclusively metallic will never be more clearly explained than by Lord OVEBSTONn. Thb alleged convenience of the rival sys'tem has been advocated with consummate ingenuity by Mr. Mii. With the whole field of discounts, of depoeits, and of accommodation bils to expatiate in, the members of the Committee will find ablundaDt room for the exercise of their industry withou' dwelling further on the doctrine of paper circulation. Yet, although banking and issue are different subjects, it does not follow that they can be distinguished in the reference to the Conmmittee. MIr. GGDSTONE complains that many men are mad on currency, and it is at least certain that the opinions which prevail on the subject are strongly held. The prepossessions of different members will probably influence their views of commercial disturbance; but it is not to be assumed that the remedies for ascertained evils will be postponed until the issue controversy is finally settled. The large majority against the amendment is the moat conclusive argument against Mr. DisnR.Fs;'S doctrine. It is clear that whether inquiry is or is not advisable, the Xouse is not in the smalles' degree disposed to repeal the Act of 1844. The short session has not been thrown away if the vote of last night has silenced for a term the clamour which was raised at the time of the crisis for the removal of all restrictions on the paper circulation. The next Parliamentary discussion on the causes of commercial distress will take a wider range, and deal with subjects of more general interest.
It is well that there should have been a diEcussion before the separation of Parliament uporn the delay which took place in the despatch of troops to India. The general feeling, be it right or be it wrong, certainly is that there was a very undue dilatoriness in the matter, and it is therefore proper that the question should be set at rest. We are now to have an inquiry before a Committee upon the subject, and, as it is one upon which every man possessed of ordinary common sense can form as correct an opinion as the most illustrious statesman or general who has ever adorned our annals, it would be idle to say that 1 he proceedings of that Committee will be watched with no ordinary interest and scrutinized with no ordinary jealousy. We wrill not prejudge a case which may now be said to be before a competent tribunal, but it may, perhaps, be as well to state what is the precise nature of the allegations made by those who impugn the conduct of the Government, and what the general condition of the argument on either side. The intelligence of the Delhi mutinies reached this country towards the end of June. The irmmediate presence of a few European regiments might just have turned the scale. Mr. FITZGERALD and the gentlemen *ho think with him tax the Government with the most criminal negligence in not having forwarded certain regiments by the overland route immediately upon the receipt of the intelligence. We are justified in assuming not only that no obstacle was thrown in our way by the French and Turkish Governments, but that they actually offered us every facility in their power for the transit of oar troops across their territories. The difficulties we had to contend with were purely those of distance and arrangement. Mr. VERYON SMr contended last night that as it was necessary to communicate with Bombay in the first instance, to receive a reply from that place, to await the collection of shipping there and its arrival at Suez before the troops could be embarked, no time would, in point of fact, have been saved. He asks credit for the delay in the departure of the post, which did not leave England until the 10th of July, and he then takes the dates as follows :-The mail left England on the 10th of July; it reached Bombay on the 10th of August. The corresponding mail left Bonabay on the 16th of August, and reached England on the 17th of September. This gives us 1 day of June, 31 days of July, 31 days of August, and 17 of September-or 80 days in all -as the period of inevitable delay. Let us assume that by efficient management and a display of super-official energy commensurate with the dire emergency 20 days might have been knocked off this estumate. It would certainly be difficult to imagine circumstances so favourable as that a few thousand English soldiers could have been forthcoming at Suez, with shipping to convey them down the Red Sea and to their destination, at an earlier period than towards the end of August, the operation commencing by the despatch of letters from London to Bombay in the first days of July. But was the shipping forthcoming at the other side? Even so, the date of the arrival of the troops at Calcutta must be timed for the first days cf October. Now, being despatched by long sea, even with the imperfect and insufficient means employed, the troops began to arrive in the middle of October. It seems probable on the whole, too, that MIr. VERNON SMITH is justified by the facts and probabilities of the case in insisting as strongly as he did last night in the Bouse upon the extreme danger which might have resulted to the troops in a sanitary point of view had they been despatched by the overland route. A ship, whether under sail or propelled by steam, is a fiery furnace on the RIed Sea in the month of September, even with all the appliances which can be provided for the comfort of the ordinary passengers. What would have been the condition of an improvised and crowded transport in those waters at the same period of the year ? There might have been delay about thetransports, theremight havebeen detention of the troops atSuez-a spot totally unprepared for their reception. The operation might have succeeded, but it might bave failed, and our circumstances just then were not such as would admit of leaving anything to chance which could be replaced by a certainty, even although that certainty bore a more sober complexion. It seems not unlikely that Ministers will be able to make out a reasonably good case before the Committee as far as the transport of troops rid Egypt is concerned, but we doubt whether they will stand equally clear when they are called upon to account for their preference of sails over steam for the conveyance of the troops by long sea. Mfr. FITZGERALD was perfectly justified in his remark last night-" While we are told of the difficulty ":of transporting troops to Alexandria, at this "very time the largest steam vessels in the Eng"lish Navy, capable of conveying an entire regi"rment each, are lying perfectly idle at Portsmouth, "Chatbam, and elsewhere." If it can be shown that an adequate supply of coal could have been provided for these steamers; it will be difficult to resiat tho concliusion that much time ihas ha idly and wantonly frittered away. Lord PRLMXRSToN's observations upon a previous occasion, as to the impolicy of denuding our shores of the protection derived from tho presence of a formidable navy, will scarcely apply to the despatch of a dozen war steamers for the conveyanco of as many regiments. This is a point which cortainly requires more efficient explanation than it received last night from Mr. VYioGtw S.m. He complains that, as President of the Board of Control, " there is no marino department attached "to his office-no naval or military man"nobody whom he can possibly consult "on questions of transport, and therefore all "Buch matters have been habitually managed by "the authorities in Leadenhall-street."1 Surely Mr. SimH is magnas inter opes tnops; it is not so far from Camnon-row to the Admiralty. He might, had he bean at the pains, have discovered some naval or military man with whom he might have taken counsel at a period of such emergency. Was this a time "to lay " the reins on the neck of the Court of Directors," andto content himself with "applying the spur" from time to time? Surely,a period will come-nay, it has already come-whetL men begin to ask each other,-What has been done by the M1inister specially charged with the affairs of India at a season of so great public calamity to shorten its duration-to avert its consequences-to prevent its recurrence ?
The shareholders of the Leviathan are patient men. To be sure, they cannot help themselves now; they are embarked in a struggle with that greatest and most portentous power in nature-the vis inertics, which they must carry out. It is another form of the siege of Sebastopol. But the siege of Sebastopol itself has not, after all, the naked dignity of a war with simple tonnage-that primordial and ancient power which existed before the CVcrOPs, before the PELASGi, before the very giants who hurled Pelion and Ossa at the Gods. And in proportion to the dignity of the contest is the patience which it demands. There are thoee shareholders of the Leviathan standing round in solemn silence, witnessing an awful silent contest; they feel the consciousness of tremendous forces at work, of pressure and weight in dreadful antagonism like two strong opposing wills, of a mighty contest of which they see the outside in the shape of timbers, hydraulic engines, rams, and cradles, but which is itself as hidden and, invisible as the action of the magnet or the journey of the electric messenger. There they are, standing round and watching for the visible effects of this invisible struggle; hours and hours and days and dayrs roll on, and small indeed and gradual is the fruit. The Leviathan is a true instance of the proverb that " You may bring a horse to the " water, but you can't make him drink,"-at least hitherto she has effectually resiited. There she lies on the very bank of the noble river that is to convey her to the ocean, but she will not as yet wet her lips. For hours and hours it is pressure-pressure-pressure, and sometimes she does not move a bit, then with a sullen noise she slips a foot, her caprices alarm the engineers, and a slip of several feet seems to threaten a second deluge. Nobody can understand her ways. Then all is still again and motionless; the cylinders burst, the timbers crack, and she will not stir an inch. We are now in the middle of this contest, and, grand as it is, the shareholders of the Leviathan maust soroetimes revert in thought to the disagreeable subject *of its enormous cost. This struggle of bydraulic power with the Leviathan has already cost 70,0001., and nobody knows how much more it will cost. We cannot understand how, with the full data before it, the number of tons to be moved, the angle of the incline, and an ascertained rate of friction, dynamic science copld not have calculated beforehand with substantial certainty and accuracy the amount of force which would be required to move the Leviathan. As it is, there has not been an approximation to a correct estimate of it,-the force has been doubled since the commencement of the process, additions being made from time to time simply as the course of the experiment and as the motionless condition of the hulk made it necessary, and not at all apparently upon any basis of previous calculation. There have been endless speculations as to how Stonehenge was erected, as to how the Cyclopean buildings in Eceotia, Argolis, and elsewhere were erected; but no theory, and hardly any legend, about CYcLors and races of giants, and their application of rude enormous strength to the uplifting of huge stones, ever raised a more awkward picture of tis consili expers than this experiment upon the Leviathan. The engines for producing motion have been scientific, but the use of them has been as rash and uncalculating as if we had been depending on primitive and uninstructed nature. There have been omissions which it is difficult to account for ;-the necessity even of providing a fulcrum from which the rams might act was not foreseen.; and when that defect was supplied, and the ship began to move, the rams, which ought to have moved with it, were stationary, and obliged to act upon the ship by long beams, which were constantly breaking, and which were always used with a sacrifice of power. Even shareholders' money was never more conspicuously wasted than in this blind, uncalculating struggle with this enormous hulk. The question has been very naturally asked, "Why -was not the "Leviathan built', to begin with, in a dry dock "of her own, which would upon the water being "let in have itself floated her wvithout further "trouble into the Thames ?" Had the expenses of this ultra-scientific machinery for motion been at all foreseen such a plan must have struck any one as far the cheaper one. But, at any rate, wly build her so far from the river, and interpose quite unnecessarily so great a distance between her and the water that was to receive her ? This was a great oversight, if anything like the present costliness of the process was anticipated, for when we find every foot of motion costs nearly a thousand pounds we may well begin to grumble at every extra foot which is gratuitous and unnecessary. The whole experiment, indeed, bears the look of the grossest miscalculation, as if the obvious and comparatively cheap expedient of a dry dock had been put aside, and even distance from the river thought of no consequence, on the strength of some great forthcoming exploit of mechanical power, which exploit, when the time comes, wholly fails. The engineer would seem purposely to have left difficulties in order that he might show the easy triumph which he could achieve over them, but when it comes to the trial the difficulties have triumphed a good deal more than the engineer. Science has seldom, indeed, looked less like herself, and more like rude, awkward, primanval nature, than in this unfortunate experiment, which will, before it is over, make the cost of the launch an utterly unheard-of proportion of the cost of the whole ship.

This statement is totally incorrect The subject having been alluded to by the gentleman who seconded my nomtna. tion, I said, I The facts of the case are these;-a desire having been expressed by some of the Conserrative party that I would allow myself to be named for the office of Chairman of Ways and Means, I had sent the following written reply- " If it should appear to be the wlsh of a majority of the House that I should accept that office I should not object to undertake it, with an anxious desire to discharge it& duties to the best of my ability ; bat that being prepared, under the peculiar circumstances of the country, to rive an independent support to Her Majesty's Government, I could not consent to be the subject of a party contest ;"' and I added, ' Should I be elected I must claim to be free to occ cupy the same independent position in the House I have hitherto done."'

TuE MARRUGE OF rHsx PBa;cmsS RoYAT-We understand it is probable that Her Majesty wiU leave Windsor for the metropolis about the middle of Januay, previously to the marriage of the Princess Royal, which is now fixed for the 25th of that month, and not for the 18th, as was originaUy announced. It i said to be Her Majesty's intention to give a series of brilliant entertainments before the day of the marriage, which will be honoured by the presence of all the Royal nisitors who are to attend the ceremony, and who, it is supposed, wil exceed 30 in num. ber. The iUustrious visitors will be partly received in Buckingham Palace, And partly at two or three of the great hotels which have been aleay engaged by Her Majestys desire for the reception of her distinguished guests.-Zan. c?ws/cr Guardian of yesterdav.

Southmolton, in the north of Devon. She has a daughter married in London, andafortnight since the daughter wrote, requestig her mother to come to town, ag she was expeoting to be conned. Accordingly, the old woman started for London, and arrived at her place of destination quite safe. On the following day, not soeing things exactly to her taste in the cleaning department, she turned up her sleeves, and put on her coarse apron, with the intentlon of scrubbing the room, but thero was no soAp. She was in the act of running out to purchase some, when her daughter called after her to mind she did not lose her way. She replied, " I should think I am not quite such a fool as that," and away she went just as we have descibed-without a bonnet ; and when she 14ttempted to return the poor soul knew neither the name of the street nor the number of the house, and she now found too late her presumption. She applied to a LOHceImn, snd Was in his hands six hours, wandering about London; at last, worn out with fatigue, and having some money in her pocket, she requested to be taken to the Pad. dington-station, that she mligt return to SonthmAolton agaan.

TEE INDIAN MUTINIES. The folowing telegram was received at the Foreign-office December 11, at 6.16 p.m.:- "ALEXANDRIA, DEc. 5. "The Bombay reached Suez on the 30th of November, bringing Bombay dates to the 17th of November. "Greathed's column, after the Battle of Agra, was pushing on with all haate towards Cawnpore, when, on the 18th, Brigadier Grant, of the 9th Lancers, joined and took the ¢ommand. On the 23d they arrived at Kanouj, where the enemy was cut up by our cavalry and five guns captured. " The force, now about 3,500 strong, reached Cawnpore on the 20th, and, being reinforced t9 5,000, crossed the Ganges on the 30th. They reached Alumbagh without obstruction on the 3d, and there wait til the Commander-in-Chief joins them. " Lucknow, said to be surrounded by 50,000 Insurgents, had not been relieved at the date of the latest advices, but stiU held out. " Our iorce at Alumbagh, only three miles from Lucknow, though in easy communication with Cawnpore, had not received a line from Lucknow for more than a month. " Heavy fighting, wit] slaughter, is believed to have occurred. " Sir 0. Campbell, who left Calcutta on the 27th of October, reached Cawnpore on the'3d of November, where he remained till the 9th, waiting, it is presumed, reinforcements, which must bring up the force at Alumbagh, when he joins, to close on 10,000 men. " On the lat of November an action was fought near the village of Kudjnai between the Dinapore mutineers and a detachment of 850 men, condsiting of part of the Naval Brigade and a detachment of the 93d Highlanders, with two 9-pounders, under Colonel Powell, of Her Majesty's 53d Foot. Oar succers was complete, but loss heavy, Colonel Powell being among (?). " The Naval Brigade afterwards fell back on Bindkee, with a view of ,returning tolFutteypore, and the rest of the troops reached Cawnpore on the 2d. " The Rhohilcund rebels have again advanced towards Nywetal (Nynee Tal), and again taken to flight on finding that the little force from that place was approaching. " Mehidpore having been attacked on the 8th of November by a body of insurgent tribes from the neighbourhood, a portion of the Malwa Contingent joined the enemy, killed Captain Mills, Lieutenant Casey, and Sergeant-Majors O'Connell and Manson, captured the guns, and compelled the other troops to retire. " According to latest accounts from Bomabay the First, Third, andFourth Divisions of Nizam Cavalry, under Major Orr, attacked the rear-guard of tbe rebls on the 12th of November at Barrarowal, recapturing the whole of the guns and stores taken from Mehidpore, Rlso two of the enemy's guns. One hundred of the enemy ildled, 74 prisoners. Our casualties not yet received, but said to be severe. " The column under Brigadier Showers has captured Ahiyjur, Dadree, Nunoond, and other places south-west of Delhl, securing upwards of 70,0001. of treasulre. "Further North, Van Cortlandt still keeps the country in order. "TLe district between Agra and Meerut is so quiet that the post and passenger carriages run daiy between the two places. "Eastward of Oude the Nepaulese Contingent has gained two victories over bodies of the insurgents. " The steatner Bengal reached Suez on the 3d Inst. from Calcutta, but brings no later dates than those from Bombay. " The dates from Hongkong are to the 30ih o October. " Preparations were being made for the assault of Canton. 'Trieste, Dec. 11, 9 30 am. " JOE GREEN. " RAVEN."

Colonel Powell killed. " The accounts from Saugor and Jubbulpore unsatisfactory. Major Erskine has earnestly demanded assistance. Brigadier Stuart's column, on its route to Mhow, had been directed to proceed thither.

Her Majesty's steamers Cumberland and Harier were at Rio, and the Syren at Pernambuco. No political news from the River Plate. Business very dulL There was a large fleet of Brazilian steamships in the river preparing for hostilities with Paraguay. At Rio supplies of coffee con'tinue moderate since last eport, not exceeding an average Of 5,600 bags per day; dealers refused to submit to lower terms, and traesactions had been restricted in consequence of continuous fla' accounts from consuming markets. Between the 13th of October and the dose of the month about 108,000 bags were sold at previous rates, but sinoe the 1st of November an extreme dulness had prevailed; several vessels had left tha port in ballast, and others with part cargoes This apathy had further increased after the receipt of the dis couraging news from Europe and the United States. Stocks of coffee amounted to 170,000 bags, and a deoline in prioes was considered inevitable. Sugar was quotedwhite, 5,000 to 5,200; browns, 4,500 to 400; hides heavy wanted; small, 480 reis. Freights further declined, and remained flat at 25s. to 30s, for Europe, and 30s. to 40s. for the United States, Exchange on London ruled for this Packet 2jid. to 27d.; Hamburg, 658 to 662; Paris, 351 to 360. At Bahia little was doing in exports, and stocks of produce were smalL The import business was dull. No transaotions: of importance in sugar, sales having been confined to a few small lots of browns in bags at 2,600 to 2,900 reis per arroba, according to quality. Supplies of co9ee coming in less freely and rices flat. A sale was re ported at 4,800 reis per arroba for unwashed seconds, Prices of cocoa lower, from 7,600 reis. Exporters of cotton refused to come into the market owing tol the high prices demanded by holders, but latterly a few purchascs for home consumption were made at 8,700 reii per arroba for Maceios; hides, 342 reis per lb. for dry salted; and 352 reis for dry assorted. A lot of the latter description alone had been purchased at 370 reis. Freights nominal. Exchange closed at 27d. The Steam Navigation Company for the coast navigation of the province of Bahla had been transferred to an English company. The Government road contracts had been com. pleted, and the works commenced. The Patent Ship Coinpany had also commenced their works. Our correspondent at Pernambuco writes as follows on November 21st:- " The Royal mail steamer Tyne arrived on the 31st ult. with London dates to the 8th of October, and telegraphic advices to the 12th, Mid Madrid and LAsbon, and the Tentonia, from Hamburg and Southampton,on the 17th inst., with datea to the 24th of October and telegraphic udvices to the 28tL. " European advices being very unfavourable, littlvboi ness has been done in produce, and no purchases of sugar were made until the 11th, when about 20,000 bags of Chan. nel and Aenericaumuscovadoes, at 2,600 reis to 2,800 reisper arroba weresold. Whites, however, being in goodrequest for Valparalso and River Plate, matntained their pnce.

Amount passed about 105,0001. " Sympathizing with their fellow-countrymen in India, the English residents in Pernambuco have through the instramentality of Mr. H.A.Cowper, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, contributed towards the Indian Relief Fund. The subscription amounts to about 8001. sterling, and goes forward by this steamer. " Her Majesty's ship Harier sailed for Bahia on the 31st tilt..

The American ship Defiance, with Iron for Bombay, disoharging her cargo and maldng 12 Inches of water per hour. The island oi Madeira was also healthy, but passengers from England calling at Lisbon were not allowed to land per last outward steamer. Strong representations ought to be made at once on this subject, no quarantine accommodation being provided. The ship Dorchester, from Bombay, was abandoned 60 miles from Madeira; orew saved. The bark Abraham, of Sunderland, was wrecked 60 miles from Lisbon, and four hands lost. The captain and remainder of the crew brought home by the Tyne.
STOPPAG1E Or FARLEY AD Co.

I MONDY-MABKETandOITYINTBILIGENOE. Friday Evening. Although a few days had passed without the declaration of any fresh failures of moment, it was feared that several were yet impending, and this expectation has to-day been realized, a series of six, some of thena of an important character, having just been announced. The chief house in the list is an old and most respectable one, Messrs. Heine, Semon, and Co., largely engaged in the trade with the North of Germany, Moldavia, &c. Their liabilities are supposed to amount to about 700,0001t, but the firm, it is said, confadently believe that every engagement will ultimately be met in full. They have available assets to a considerable amount still in hand, but, in the midst of the uncertainty caused by the numberless stoppages on the Continent, it was considered prudent for the general interests of the creditors to suspend at once. Messrs. Weinholt, Wehner, and Co., a German house connected with the trade to the East Indies and Australia, have also stopped. Their liabilities range between 250,0001. and 300,0001., and the prospects of the liquidation appear to be doubtf ili, since they depend on realizations from produce and collections from abroad, as well as upon the proceeds of bills on other failed houses. At the beginning of the year the firm had a considerablsurplus. Messrs. T. H. Flmenhorst and Co., German mer chants, trading principally to the North of Europe, have also been brought down. The firm have always occupied a good position, and there is a hope the difficulty may prove but temporary. They hold the paper of other suspended houses, and the immediate cause of their embarrament has consisted ia the failure of Messrs. Albert Pelly and Co. The total amount of their liabilities has not transpired. The bills have also been returned of Messrs. Montoya, Saenz, and Co., an old Spanish firm of respectable standing as general merchants. The debts are believed to be very small, the house having been closing its transactions for some time past. The next announcement is that of the Worcester Bank of Farley, Lavender, and Co. Tn this case the liabilities are believed to be very small. The bank was established more than 60 years ago, and haa for some time been in a state of decay. It enjoyed a privileged circulation of 15,4631., but the amount of notes at present outstanding in sa5d to be orly about 4)0001. Lastly, the stoppage has been notified of Mr. T G. Ward (formerly Tisdall and Ward), of West Smithfield, who appears in the list of London bankers, but whose business wa principally that of agent to cattle salesmen. The xtent of his engagements has not been stated. Some set-off against theee disastrous circumstances is to be found, however, in the fact of two large establishments having been able to present statements and securities to the Bank of England which have appeared sufficient to warrant support being extended to them. It is understood that Messr-. Robert Smith and Co., of Manchester, a firm very largely connected with the silk trade, regarding whom some anxiety has been felt during the past few days, have obtained aid from that establishment which will fully insure their safety, and that an application from the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Banking Company, which stopped on the 17th of November with liabilities estimated at about 1,000,0001., has also been acceded to. This bank reopened on Tuesday last for the redemption of its note circulation, and may now be expect to resume its ordinary business in the course of next week. Had its resuscitation been found impracticable, much distress would have bwn created in the iron districts. The English funds continue to show great buoyancy. They opened this morning at a fresh advance of a quarter per cent., which was maintained to tho close. Consola for the opening were firt quoted 1 to i ex. dividend, and ia tho afternoon, on receipt of the Indian now regarding the largo force advancing to the rolief of Lucknow, a further improvement occurred, and some bargains were effected at 92. The additional riso, however, was afterwards lost, and the final operations were at 91g to J. The Bank return in the Gazette, which shows an increase of 713,0221. in the bullion, and 1,632,1451. in the reserve, was expected to be favourable, and this, with the certainty of large gold supplies continuing to pour in, and the satisfactory statement of the Bank of France, assisted in creating a general feeling of confidence. Bank Stock left off at 217 to 219; Reduced and New Three per Cents,, 91f to i ; India Bonds, 35s. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to par. Some loans on Government securlties were negotiated to-day in the Stock-Exchange at from 6i to 7 per cent. till the January dividends. Out of doors the demand is gradually diminishing, and a belief Is entertained that when a reduction of the Bank rate is commenced the downward movement will be rapid. The principal feature in the foreign stock-market is the continued advance in Turkisb, which is nearly 7 per cent. above the point at which it stood a month ago. Other descriptions are in little request. Russian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 105i, 104i, and 105S; ditto Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96k; Mexican, 18i ; Portuguese, 43i; Spanish New Deferred, 25; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 93, 92k, 93i and 921, and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 100 and 99k. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon Amsterdam and Paris were slightly lower, and Hamburg was about the same as last post. The actual business transacted was unimportant. The corn-market this morning was dull, at former rates. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market this weelk shows great heaviness, at a decline of fully id. per lb. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 30c. for money, and G6f. 45c. for the end of the month, showing an advance of more than a quarter per cent. At Amsterdam and Vienna extreme flat- ness still prevails. About 210,0001. of gold, nearly allAustralian, was sold to the Bank to-day. Sovereigns are also coming in from Ireland and other places The gold by the Essex, 421,0201., vill be delivered to-morrow, and the whole is expected to go to the Bank. The precise amount of silver shipped by the steamer Caledonia to sail for Hamburg to-morrow morning is 50,1481. The African mail steamer Gambia has brought 12,0001. The figures presented in the monthly return of the Bank of France furnish a remarkable illustration of the effect produced in that country by the advance of the rate of discount to 10 per cent. at the beginning of November, and justify the reduc. tions to the extent of 2 per cent. subsequently made. The bullion, which in the previous account showed a falling off of 1,440,0001., has experienced an increase of 1,860,0001., and now stands at 9,440,0001., although the prermiumr paid for artificial purchases, which last month amounted to 15,0001., has not been more than 10, 0 001. Even allowing, therefore, for the effect of the police restrictions to prevent any efflux, which were said at the height of the prisis to have been redoubled, it is evident that a strong turn of the tide must have X9ak p'a4 uwtuklly. While VW buluou AM be rapidly increasing the note circulation has been drawn in in a greater ratio, a diminution having occurred of 1,960,0001. A withdrawal of 3,120,0001,. of deposits has been coincident with a coutraction of 3,080,0001. in the discounts. The balance to the credit of the Treasury has increased 55,0001., and the advances on stocks and shares have been reduced by about 240,0001. The telegraphic quotations from India to-day show a further favourable movement of a half! per cent. at Calcutta. At Bombay, on the contrary, there had been a rise of 2 or 3 per cent., owinI doubtlems to the heavy shipments of specie made' thence to Calcutta. From China it is stated the quotation at Rongkong remained at 4s. 11,d., whie at Shanghai it had gone from 6s. 8d. to Os. lld. Prices of silk were unaltered. The settlement is 12,000 bales less than last year. On politica2 matters the only statement is " It is expected Canton will be taken some time in November." In the produce-markets during the week the transactionsl have been of moderate extent, and towards the close the late partial advance was generally lost. Numerous public sales of sugar have been held, including a considerable quantity of foreign muscovado, but most descriptions have given way about 1l, excepting the finest grocery, while low brown Mauritius has in some cases been parted 'with at a decline of is. 6d., which corresponds with the extreme depression in November. Several arrivals have taken place from the United States. The present low quotations appear to have a favourable influence upon the deliveries for consumption. Coffee has experienced a reduction of about ls. for plantation Ceylon. Two floating cargoes of Rio are reported at several shillings under the last sale effected. Arrivals of cocoa from the continent have still the effect of un3ettling prices. In rice there has been no material alteration. The quotations of spice have suffered a further depresion, casia lignea being the only exception. Saltpetre has experienced a fall of about 2a, the prices now current being nearly the same as at the heaviest perlod of last month. Great flatness continues in the tea-market, and little business has transpired beyond some parcels pressed for sale. At auction yesterday 5,000packages were realized at easier rates. At a special meeting of the London Cnartered Bank of Australia this afternoon, Mr. Duncan Dunbar in the chair, a dividend was declared for the half-year ending the 30th of June last at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, free of inoome-tax, carrying forward a balance of 10,0921. The bank was stated to be in a satisfactory position. The stoppage of the well-known firm of M. Pontoppidam, the DanLsh Consul at Hamburg, has been announced to have been only momentary, ample assistance having been obtained to enable it to meet all its engagements. It is understood that even if the diffioulty had not been surmounted the London correspondents of the house, Messrs. Westenholz, Brothers, would not have been in any way compromised Advices from Hamburg contradict a statement of the suspension of J. D. Matzenbecher, S5hne, of that city. A correspondent also writes:- " I beg to send you the folowing lines In order to rectify some remarks in recentletters from Hamburg. In one of them it has been stated, ' the houses of T. J. Merok and Co., and Behrens, Gosser, and Co. have got allotted to them almost the whole of the 15,000,000 of bonds on merchandiso' Now, til yesterday only two milions and a half of these bonds have been issued, and it is not very likely our Government would allot to two houses only such large smms. The two above-mentioned houes are named not T. J. Merck, or Merche, as was spelled, but H. T, Merck and Co.; and not Behrens, Gossler, but Behrenberg, Gossler, and Co. " It has also beep stated that there was an assembly of our * hereditary burgesees; it ought to bx ' householder burgesses' The first word Is in German ' erblich,' the latter erbgesesson,' which means what you would call holding freehold property.' Acoording to our laws only those citizens have a right to appear in our little Parliament who poses a house in town or in the suburb. In one of your city articles you mention that the idea of postponing all paymonts on due bills for 30 days has been abandoned Allow mo to observe that, to my best knowledge, such an idea nover was entertinod seriously for one moment, though it may have been tho opinion of a single individua.L" The accountants retained by Messrs. Heine, Sec mon, and Co. are Messrs. Turquand and Co. Messrs. Weinholt, Wehner, and Co. have placed their books in the hands of Mr. J. C. Clarke. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day it was intimated that in the course of a day or two a dividend of 9d. in the pound will be declared under the estate of Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Bates, bankers, in addition to the 2s. 3d. in the pound already paid. The London wool sales commenced on the 8th inst. and closed to-day. According to Messrs. Willans and Overbary, the attendance of buyers was limited, and biddings were languid. Prices of East India wools were fully lid. per lb. below the last Liverpool sales' rates, and the reduction in Egyptian may be quoted at even more than this. The withdrawals were extensive, especially of Russian and Mogador wools. The dividends are advertised of the Spanizh Consolidated and Deferred Stock and the New South Wales Govermment Debentures. The return from the Bank of England for the week ending the 9th of December glves the following results when compared with the previous week:- Public Deposits ... £6,648,062 ... Increase £575,795 OtherDeposits ... 14,440,724 ... Increase 4,538 Rest ... ... 3,493,918 ... Increase 34,562 On the other side of the account:- Government Securities £5,434,022s ...

Increase 1,632,145 The amount of notes in circulation is 20,142,7701., being a decrease of 959,6601. ; and the stock of bullion in both departmente is 8,069,4891., showing an increase of 713,0221. when compared with the preceding return.

British Gaiana.-The office of surgeon-general of Demerara has become vacant by the death of Dr. David Blair.-CiviU Seri-ic Gazette. STRANGE CASE OF MUIRDZB AND SUIcIDE.-On Thursday morning, at an early hour, a murder and suioide of a most tragical and distressing character took place at Thornton-heath, about a mile distance from the town of Croydon, For some years past rs. blary Smitbers, a lady of some property, and her two sons, one, William Hilton Smithers, aged 33. and the other Charles Smithers, aged 18, oconpled the house, No. 49, Thornton-heath, and the family were remarkable for the love and affecfion which seemed to subsist between them. Wiliam Eilton. the elder son, has been a clerk in the Bank of England, from which establishment he received a salary of 2001. per annum, and Charles has been engaged in the factory of Mr. Burnett, engineer, at Deptford, preparatory to entering the Bank of England also, which he expected to do in a few weeks. William has been remarkable for his steadiness and general deportment, until very recently, when, unfortunately a totalchange came over him, and recently he hasbeen known to drink brandy to excess. This ohange, there can be no doubt, has been occasioned by his becoming a speculator on 'Change and the ill-luck which attended these speculations. On one time-bargain alone he is said to have lost as much as 701., and this sum he borrowoed from a friend In the beginning of the week to pay over to his stockbroker. His losses, it would seem, were considerable, for, from some papers foumd, it appears that assignments were prepared for the disposal of some life policies, and a bill for 5001. for acceptance frona a gentleman in the city were found among them. It had been his (William's) custom to sleep downstairs, but, from some cause or other, he for several nights preceding the unfortunate occurrence slept with his brother on the first floor-a proceeding objected to by his mother, who insisted on his resting in his own bed. On Thursday night the unfortunate lady called out to her younger son, and asked "if William had gone to his own room;" and the answer, though not true, was in the affirmative. Nothing, however, occurred on that night to excite suspicion or alarm- the mother and brothers went to bed as usual, and on the folloving morning, about 7 o'clock, the servant, Eliza Morgan, having waited some time beyond the usual period at which the fanmly came to breakfast, went to the bedroom of Charles, and listened for a moment or so, but, hearing no noise, sbe pushed the door open, and the first thing which caught her view was the face of her young master, with a dark froth about the mouth and nostrils. The sight so alarmed her that she returned from the room, and at once ran to the house next door for assistance. Returning vith the servant maid, they entered the bedroom, wbere they found both the brothers perfectly lifeless, and a phial and a wine-gla on the foot of the bed. The servant (Eliza) summoned resolution, and proceeded to her mistress's bedroom on the same floor, and on entering it she found the unfortunate lady quite dead. She lay on the bed with her head resting on her right hand, the bed perfectly unruffled. Though no human aid could have been of the slightest avail, medical aid was sought after, but it was quite an hour before it could be procured, and at the end of that time Mr. Bottomly, of Croydon, made his appearance, and pronounced all three dead. Inspector A Frazer, of the P divis{on of police, stationed at Croydon, was soon on the spot, snd took charge of the house and propertv. It appears that Mrs. Smithers had been ailing for some days, and that her son Wilrian had been in the habit of giving her the mediCineprescrlbed for her illness, and by this means had been enabled to give her the fatal dose. which must in a moment bave terminated her existence, It is the opinion of those who have seen him that the fatal drug must have been poured into the mouth of the youth Charles while he lay on his baok, and that the sudden shook to the circulation hnd caused the froth about the mouth and nostril. It is also telleved that the quantity of prussic acld taken by the unfortunate murderer himself was so great that his death was immediate. Information of the tragical act has been forwarded to the coroner, but no time is yet mentioned for the holding of the inquest. FRIGHTFuL AccrDEN-T.-A frightful accident took place on Tuesday at Aberayvon, a port seven miles aorth of Newquay, Cardiganshire. About a hundred yards above the bridge at Aberayvon is a waterwheel erected for threshing corn, snd on the suamit of a cliff 60 yards distant stands the barn where the threshing is carried on. A large iron rod connects the wheel with the mill. The rod is carried through the rock, which has been cleft for its insertion. This rod rests at intervals for support on large blocks of rock, the rod being secured to the blocks by a sort of railway chain, and is thus confined close to the rock. On Tuesday, as a workman in the employ of Mr. Evams, a farmer, was engaged in oiling the rod, his coat-tail was drawn in while it was inrapid revolution, and his head was nearly severed from his body. The body was drawn in and fearfully crushed, An inquest was held on the following day, and a verdict of "accidental death" was returned. It was suggested that the bar should in fnture be covered in smoxE NuiSANCE ABAMXMsEN-.-By this Act, which received the Royal assent on the 29th of July, 1856, from and after the 1st of January next the provision whereby certain furnaces in glass and pottery works were exempted from the operation of the Act of 1853 is repealed; and all steamvessels plying to and fro between Londoubridge and the Nore Light, also furnaces employed in public baths and washlouses, are subject to the provisions of this Act.
