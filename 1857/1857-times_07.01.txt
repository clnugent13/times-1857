hEBR MATJESTY'S VISIT TO MAAOHESBTR. twiumi OUR OWN CORUFlSPOXNMIN'T MANCHESTER, JuN S30. The career of the Art Treasures Exhibition culminated yesterday when Her Majesty and the Court visited the collection in State, and amid such fervent demonst3ations of public enthusiasm and display as it would be difficult to parallel in any of our modern Royal progresses. From Woraley Hall to the spot where she alighted at the building, along a route of nearly 10 miles, it was one continued ovation; an outburst of loyalty and hearty welcome such as we have seldom witnessed, and, perhaps, never seen surpassed. Ir the whole proceedings there was a warmth and depth of feeling that was almost moving. The ordinary chill of the English nature was thoroughly cast off and all Lancashire seemed to share in a holyday welcome to its Sovereign. It is not often that the population of the little village of Woraley have an opportunity of seeing the most illustrious personages of the Court, and their anxiety to witness the departure from the Hall was exactly in proportion to the noveltyof the sight. The cortege was fixed to leave Worsley Hall at 9 o'clock, and almost to the very minute the Royal party and suite began to enter their carriages. A fearful storm had raged over Mlanchester and its neighbourhood the evening before, so that the ground was cool, and even the manufacturing dust of such places as Swinton and a polysvllabic village called "Irlamo'-the-Heights" was for once completely laid. It also appeared more than. probable that the rain would volunteer its assistance when it was scarcely needed, for heavy electric clouds lurked ominously in the horizon, and it required all the confidence in "Queen's weather" to induce many to venture forth. Unfortunately the confidence was not quite justified by the day. The private carriages of the Earl of Ellesmere, the Earl of Burlington (Lord-Lieutenant of the county), and Mr. Towneley, the High Sheriff, preceded those containing the illustrious visitors and their suite. The order of the procession we have already given, so that a repetition here is needless. A detachment of the Lancashire Yeomanry, which would certainly have been mistaken for real soldiers, acted as escort. As the procession quitted the handsome avenue which leads out upon the Manchester road it was welcomed with inspiriting cheers by the spectators, some eleven or twelve hundred of whom were tenants of Her Majesty's noble host. The beautiful little church of St. Mark's, erected just opposite the gates of the park, and in the churchyard of which, under a plain stone slab, lies the late Earl of Ellesmere, was slowly passed, and then it proceeded down the road at a rapid rate. At Swinton, which is a town of some size, every man, woman, and child in the place had turned out, and every window was thronged with wistful face. There was, of course, no great display of loyal bunting here, though everything was pressed into the service that conduced to ornament, and many things which had rather a contrary effect. But there was no mistake about the cheers. An unlimited supply of them seemed always on hand, and Her Majesty really got a hearty and enthusiastic reception. So also at the vilage, with three or four names, before mentioned, the population of which shouted as if for their very lives. The piCturesqUe road of Pendleton was not so crowde , though in front of every villa gay parties of ladies and gentlemen were assembled, who cheered and waved their hate and handkerchiefs while the corEge remained in sight. Here a triumphal arch had been erected at the expense of the gentry round Pendleton, which, of its kind, was one of the most tasteful and handsome of them all. It was a triple arch, lofty, but of light and graceful proportions, which were well set off with 'lags and coloured streamers. Just out of Pendleton, at Cross-lane, the 4th Dragoon Guards, under Colonel Hodge, C.B., were drawn up to join the prooession. Here also was the carriage of Lord Overstone, President of the General Council of the Exhibition, and LieutenantGeneral Sir IL Smith, the commandant of the district, and his Staff, all of whom followed in the wake of the Royal cartMge, the Dragoons cantering along at a smart pace, with a jingle and clatter which heralded their approach far down the road. It- was, -fortmate that the first tasteful emblem of loyal welcome under wrhich Her Majesty passed was placed at Pendleton, for first impressions are everything, even in the case of Royal visits. But for this, the first object of the kind to astonish the Royal party would have been the triumphal arch at Winrior-bridge, than which a more hideous obstacle to traffic was never erected. 3 It was of the early clothes'-horse style of art, but ' bore a general resemblance to many other objects, snch as a colossal meat safe or a granite magnet. - The calico, painted to resemble stone, hung in loose ungainly wrinkles, which swayed and bellied out with every puff of wind, and was so badly joined withal that every movement showed the rough skeleton of timbers that held the *:nsightly object up to the ridicule and laughter which were freely showered on it from every side. Its heavy top was made still more cumbrous by an attempt at grouping flags. From this point the throng of spectators along the footways was in dense anA gradually increasing numbers as the route approached the great centre of attraction at Old Praflord. They bore with patient, loyal fortitude the frequent heavy showers of rain that almost marred the day's proceeding. The triumphal arch on the road was one of real taste in design and most admirably executed. Its general featares were not unlike those of the well-known London Marble-arch, and the imitation of real stonework was excelUently carried out. It was over the entrance into Peel Park, and so placed as to form a handsome and striking feature in the landscape. So also wvas the Royal Dispensary, which was draped from roof to basement with coloured cloth in pillars, festoons, and rosettes, so arranged with regard to hues as to produce a very rich eftect. From this part of the route banners, evergreens, and designs of all kinds were innumerable. No house was without a flag, while not a few had half-a-dozen or more, in addition to loyal mottoes and garlands of laurel. Some with true Manchester tact combined both loyalty and business in the same design, and after "V. A." and " Welcome" went on to inform the public that the old-established concern, &c. was still there, or had removed to over the way, as the case might be. Strong colours too predominated, and to judge from appearances "Turkey reds" have not been much sought after lately, for there evidently was a large stock on hand, and whole furlongs streamed from every window. As a general rule, however, the effect was very good and worthy of the occasion. The great factories where the labour which clothes half the inhabitants of the globe Eeems always going forward were for once quiet and deserted, and stood grim and severe like giant taakmasters rebuked amid the general festivity. Tall chimneys, too, the only spires of this metropolis of toil, wore an empty holyday appearance as though labour had fled his capital. Most of the cotton mills were stuck al over with flags and banners, but this was a kind of compromise, and merely for appearance sake as even dressing them with rainbows would fail to impart a gay or festive appearance to sueh Argus, looking buildings, every window in which has a hard, scrutinizing aspect, as if always on the watch and hungry for the vans of cotton which disappear ,hour after hour, in their capacious maws. They seemed to endure bright streamers under protest, and to look harder and higher than ever under the flaunting intruders on their grim, black walls. There was only one exception to this rule, and that was in the case of the blackest-looking block in all Manchester. It was almost covered with flags, festoons, and garlands, and bore along its front a polossal device inscribed with the words, " The .twelve hundred workpeople employed in this factory greet and welcome their Queen." At Albert-bridge the procession was met by the Mayor of Manchester, attended by the Town-clerk, and from this spot to the Exhibition a walking pace was not exceeded. Her Majesty was evidently deeply gratified at the enthusiastic reception which she met on every side. For enthusiasm or welcome few Royal progresses or visits will bear comparison with that of yesterday. Just beyond Albert-bridge a splendid arch was erected. On most of these decorations the men' were at work till an hour or so before Her Majesty passed under them. Yet not one was left unfinished, nor (save the one horrid exception we have mentioned) were any otherwise than handsome and imposing. That at Albert-bridge was really a rost striking ormament. From this the procession passed along Bridge-atreet, John Dalton-street, Crossstreet, into St. Anne-street and St. Anne-square. In these two latter thoroughfares the inhabitants, as in many other parts of the route, had rebelled against the parsimonious arrangement of the Town Council, which said to such and such an amount should the loyal demonstration go, and no further; and limited the sum to be spent on deoorations to 1,0001. They had acwordingly raised a sub*criptior among themselves and decorated these streets at their own expense. Lofty eoloured poles were placed at short intervals, and between and across the roads hung garlands of flowers and evergreens which had a really beautiful effect. Market-street, Piccadilly, and Portlandstreet were traversed; every house was decorated, every window thronged; wooden balconies were erected from the houses, which were crowded with ladies and gentlemen, and in some eases seemed over-crowded to a dangerous extent, and kept the mob below in greater peril than was ever undergone by Damocles. No outer scaffolding was erected in front of the Mayor's splendid new warehouses, and the whole of this spacious range, which reminds one of the Houses of Parliament on a small scale, was left unbroken by plank or beam, and only relieved by flags and coloured draperies. Thus, amid an indescribable scene of public enthusiaam and display the procession moved slowly on, its approach being knowvan far in advance by the deafening cheers which accompanied it throughout. At the junction of the Stretford-road with the Chester-road, close to the Old Trafford toll-bar, a really graceful triumphal arch had been erected, from a design by M¢r. George Faulkner, of MIan. chester. Brtween it and the toll-bar great crowds of people were assembled, having begun to occupy their places several hours before the time at which Her Majesty was expected, but the passage was kept much wider and clearer than on the occasion of the opening of the Exhibition by Prince Albert. The extensive space of ground between the toll-bar and the Palace, under the control of the Executive Committee of the Exhibition, seemed almost vacant by contrast with the densely thronged thoroughfares by which the cort6ge had passed, but there must have been many thousands of people on the wooden platforms which had been erected on the north side of the approach. The charges for seats on these platforms ranged from 5s. to 10s., and they were nearly all filled, notwithstanding the showery weather. The windows and gardens in front of the houses were likewise occupied by gaily dressed spectators, and there was abundance of banners and decorations. The approaches to the Palace were lined on each side by about 450 of the enrolled pensioners, under Major Bond and Captain Ready, sand the 25th Regiment of Infantry, between 600 and 700 strong, under Colonel Lysons. The doors of the Exhibition were to open at 9 o'clock, but it iS hardly necessary to say that all the approaches were thronged with hundreds before that hour. When the public were admitted a futile attempt was made to pass them through the usual turnstiles, which, as a matter of course, led to confusion, struggling, and annoyance. Eventually, however, the side-doors were thrown open, and the stream allowed to flow past uninterruptedly. Within half-an-hour after the building was opened every place in its spacious area was filled with ladies and gentlemen. The throng at the upper part was very dense, for here the main features of the ceremonial were to be enacted. Among many others, we remarked Lord Palmerston, Mr. Disraeli and Mfrs. Disraeli, Lord and Lady Claude Hamilton, the Duke and Duchess of Manchester, his Excellency the Prussian Minister, and the CountessBernstorff, the Nicaraguan Minister, Viscount and Viscountess Ebrington, the Earl and Countess of Stanhope, the Bishop of Manchester, Sir Culling Eardley, Sir R. Bulkeley, Sir 11oderick Murchison, Lord Henry Lennox, Sir Philip and Lady Grey Egerton, Lord Talbot de Malahide the Earl of Cawdor, Lord Scarsdale, Lord do iabley, Sir Morton Peto, Lord Ward, Sir Hervey Bruce, Lord Hill, the Marquis of Breadalbane, the Earl of Wilton, Lady Seymour, Colonel Lake, Sir W. Eden, Sir J. Forbes, Mr. I Salomons, Colonel Wilson Patten, Mr. Cheetham, M.P Mr Baines, M.P., Sir J. Kay Shuttleworth, Mr. Wrenfell, M.P., General Sir Fenwick Williams, M.P., Mr. Granville H[arcourt, M.P., Sir Joseph Paxton, M.P., the Provost of Eton, Sir lMkanah and r ady - Armitage. Sir John Potter. M.P., Mr. W. B. GlMastone, M.P., Ron. S. T. Cleijients, ALP., Mr. Hindley, M.P., Mr. Bass, ALP., &c. No alteration had taken place in the interior arrangements of the building since the occasion of the visit of the Prince Consort, except that the dais at the upper end was larger, and suited to the accommodation of seven persons instead of one. The Sevres vases also ranged along the centre transept were filled with rich bouquets, and seemed amid the general richness of colour on all sides to be merely the tallest flowers in the vast parterre. Her Majesty was expected to arrive at 11; but the massive throng which lined every street through which the corage passed delayed the procession till 20 minutes past 11. Just at that time the weather, which throughout the morning had threatened much and occasionally fulfilled a little, changed sadly for the worse. The wind rose and drove the heavy rain before it with pelting violence just as the 4th Dragoons, heading the procession, approached the building at a smart trot. All the carriages hinch' conveyed the Royal party were open, and seemed especially adapted to catch the rain which then was falling heavily. As several carriages preceded that containing Her Majesty, the occupants-no matter how distinguished-had to descend with all speed, for the Royal party were waitinr in the rain for their turn to draw up. Her Majesty seemed considerably amused at the hurry with which each alighted and hurried.on; and the Prince Consort, in a great coat, was doing his utmost to manage a large carriage umbrella and assist Her Majesty to descend. Her Majesty alighted at a door on the right of the general entrance, which led into a tented corridor formed of red and white drapery, and along the base of which were beds of moss strewn with the choicest cut flowers, while baskets of creepers hung from the roof. The end of the corridor opened into and afforded a superb coup l'Xil of the whole length of the interior of the Exhibition. Her Majesty did niot, however, enter by this avenue, but, turning to the right, passed into the reception room, which in itself is an art treasure, a bijou of rich decoration. It is in the Louis Qruize style, with walls of draperied mirrors, an elaborate white and gold ceiling, with rose-coloured furniture. Opposite the entrance, supporting a large mirror, was a magnificent console table, covered with a rare slab of brocadilla marble, on either side of which were inlaid cabinets, with candelabra of Sevres porcelain, exquisitely painted. A clock in the same style, bat surmounted with a peculiar Sevres vase, occupied the centre of the table. Two large windows are ina front of the room, which were draped with curtains of crimson silk, covered with real lace, the space between the windows being filled with mirrors, in front of which stood an elaborate white and gold jardiniere, filled with cut flowers. All the doors were covered with mirrors and draped with crimson velvet, and the rich Aubusson carpet was in keeping with the general tone of the whole apartment. The withdrawving rooms for Her Majesty were fitted with pale sea-greenthangings, covered with lace, and furntuttre to match. The ante-chamber leading from this into the Exhibition was entirely of the Cinquecento period, and furnished with Venetian chairs, tables, and inlaid cabinets from the Soulage Collection. Groups of ancient weapons and figures in armour stood in niches round this apartnent, the walls of which were covered with ancient silk tapestry of the period. In the reception room the water-colour drawing of the opening ceremony, painted for Messrs. Agnew by Louis Hagh was fixed in a conspicuous position, and we are informed elicited a most marked and gracious expression of approbation from Her Muajesty. In compliance with a wish nanimouslv expressed by the citizens of Manchester an engraving is to be published of this admirable work. Precisely at half-past 11 Her Majesty, leaning on the arm of the Prince Consort, followed by the Prince of Prussia and the Princess Royal, the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, and the Princess Alice, issued from the reception room, and, conducted by the members of the Executive Committee, proceeded up the transept. The whole of the large audience rose as HIer Majesty came forth and welcomed her with prolonged cheering, which was reiterated with almost increased vehemence on the approach of the illustrious young couple who immediately followed. The Royal party proeeded to the round dais, and remained standing while the National Anthem was sung by the orchestra, the solos by Clara Novello and Sims Reeves ringing clear and loud through every part of the building. At its condlujiion A&, Fa rbalmA ad7aiced, Nid1 having been presented to Her Majesty by Sir George Grey, went through the form of reading anl address from the Executive Committee, of which, it is needless to say, not a syllable was audible. The address was as follows:- " TQT TuE B EE's MOST E4XCELLENT MAJESTY. 'TIIE ADDRESS OF THE KXECUTIVz COSmTrEE OF TM EXHIBITIOX OF ART TREASURS OF TEE UNTS5E =IGDOM. "May it please your Majesty, "We, the Executive Conmittee for conducting the Exhibition of Art Treasures of the 'United Kingdom, humbly approach your Majesty with sentiments of devoted loyalty and attachment to your person and throne. We tendei to your Majesty our grateful acknowledgment, not only for the early encouragement which your Majesty and your illustrious Royal Consort extended to our undertaldng, but for the munificent, valuable, and most instructive con tributions which are to be found in this exhibition through your Majesty's favour. Deeply sensible that the duties of Royal patronage in no way demanded so marked an indication of your Majesty's approval, it is most gratifying.t us to acknowledge how great a part of our success is due to the influence of the Royal example upon others, and with honourable pride we would venture to regard this ceremonial as the crowning evidence of yourgajesty's continued confidence in the disinterestedness of the promoters of the Exhibition, and inthe national usefulness of the5r am. "The achievements of the genius of all countries, and the productions of ages of thought and patient research, which are gathered within these walls, speak- convincingly. of the wealth, the lengthened prosperity, and the presenEocial happiness of the country which possesses them. "The suggestion of his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, that these treasures should be so arranged as to insrzuct the mind as wel as please the eye has been adopted; and we sincerely hope that the example of your Majesty's presence here this day, at so early a period after the opening of the ExBhibition, wll appeal powerfuly to all your Majestys subjects, and induce all ranks, high and low, to gather here those lessons which nothing else teaches so forcibly as artto the ignorant, refinement, to the proud, humility. We most cordially and respectfully thank your Majesty for the especial favour of this visit; and we fervently pray that health and happiness may long attend upon your Majesty, your Royal Consort, and every member of the Royal Famaily. "On behalf of the committee, "THOMfAS FAIRBAIRtN, Chairman." To this address Her Majesty read the following gracious reply - " Ithanik yon sincerely for the assurance of your attachment to my throne and person, and for the affectionate wishes for myself and my family which you have expressed in your loyal and dutiful address " The splendid spectacle presented to my Tview on this occasion affords a gratifying proof both of the generous mu. nificence with which the possessors of valuable works of art in this country have responded to your desires, and encouraged your efforts in the attainment of this great result, and also of the enlightened taste and judgment which have guided you in the arrangement of the treasures placed at .your disposal. "I learn with great pleasure that the contributions which it has been the happiness of myself and of the Prince, my consort, to offer to this exhibition, have enhanced its value, and have been conducive to the success of an under. taking ofsuch high national interest and usefulness. " I cannot doubt that your disinterested exertions will i receive their best revward in the widely-diffused gratification and the elevating and refining influence produced among th - vast numbers of every rank and station whom the position of this building, in the midst of a denso and industriou population, invites to a contemplation of the magnificen collection of works of art displayed within these walls." The members of. the Executive Committee were then severally presented by Sir George Grey, and had the honour of kissing Her Majestv's hand. The corporation of Manchester, headed by the Mayor, Mr. James Watts, next advanced to the throne, and the Xecorder of the city of Manchester, Mt. AKrmstrong, Q.C., read the following address . "To THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCsELET MAJESTY. "May it please your Majesty,-We, your Majesty's most loyal and faithful subjects, the Mayor, Aldermen, and citizens of the city of Manchester, humbly approach your Majesty to offer, as the representatives of the inhabitants at,large, the homage of an ardent and devoted attachment to your Majesty's person. ,"Wa tender to your b_Xajeqty our sincere *nd heartf9lt congratulatloOs aon- -th7Be-7-6ri ausplioas Er'irth of- -a Princess, and the assurance of our unfeigned thankfulness tO Divine Providence for having graciously preserved a lite invaluable to your Majesty's family and to the whole of the British nation. ; " Wo venture most respectfully to assure your Majesty of the gratitude felt for the gracious patronage and support ever afforded by your Majesty to all effozts made for the improvement either of the moral or physical condition of your people, and we hail with feelings of delight the gratifying evidence now afforded in the august presence among us of your Majesty, accompanied by your illustrious consort and other members of the Royal family. " We most respectfully offer to your Majesty our con. gratulations upon the approaching alliance between her Royal Highness the Princess Royal and his Royal Highness Prince Frederiok William of Prussia, believing that such alliance will not only secure the happiness of your Majesty's daughter, but will also perpetuate a cordial and friendly feeling between the two great nations so deeply interested in the future destiny of the illustrious individuals about to he united. "We fervently pray that your Majesty may long be spared in the enjoyment of every domestic felicity, and be permitted by Divine Providence for many years to come to confer the blessings of a beneficent reign upon a truly loyal and grateful people. "Given under the Common Seal of the Corporation, this 17th day of June, 1857." Sir George Grey having presented the reply, Her Majesty read it as follows - , "I receive with great satisfaction the assurance which you have on this occasion offered me of devoted attachment to 3ry throne and person. "I thank you sincerely for the warm interest which you have expressed in all that concerns my own welfare and that of my family, and for your congratulations on the approaching union of my eldest daughter with the Prince o. -p illustrious house, which, while it affords to them, under God's blessing, the best prospect of happiness, will, I trust, also be conducive to the interests of this kingdom. "I have the greatest pleasure in again visiting Machester, not only because it enables me to mark my cordial approval of the valuable and interesting exhibition which has been opened with so much success within these walls, but also because it has given me another opportunity of witnessing the gratifying proofs of the ardent loyalty and attachment of the inhabitants of this great seat of maun*facturing industry. " You may be assured that there is no object nearer to my heart than to advance the best interests and permanent 'welfare of my loyal and faithful people, At the conclusion of the reply Mr. James Watts, e Mayor advanced, and, kneeling at the foot of tel daa, Her Majesty received a straight, crosshandled sword from the Prince Consort, which she gracefully laid on the shoulder of Mr. Watts, who by the act was knighted, and rose up Sir James. The honour was so quietly and so instantly conferred that it seemed to take the audience by surprise for an instant, when prolonged cheering arose from all parts of the building. The same honour had, we are informed, been previously offered to Mr. Thomas Fairbairn and 1Ir.Heelis, the Mayor of Saliord, but was most respectfully declined by those gen-lemen. The Mayor and Corporation of the borough of Salford then presented the third and last address, as follows "To HEnR MosT GRAcIouS MAJESTY Ti QUE}. " We, your Majesys dutiful subjects, the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the borough of Salford, in the county palatine of Lancaster, approach your Majesty with feelings of the most devoted loyalty and attachment. "We present our respectful but hearty congratulations on the recent auspidous event-the birth of a princess, "We are gratified at seeing in your Majesty's company on this oc3asion your Royal Consort and several junior members of your family, together with a prince to whoan one of them is soon to be united, and though that event will cause the first inroad upon a happy domestic circle, yet as it has your Majesty's approval, and will take place under circumstances which promise much happiness to the parties more immediately concerned, we cannot withhold our congratulations and the expression of our earnest hope that he utmost anticipations o f such happiness may be fully realized. "We regard your Majesty's presence among us, in cony nexlon with the -Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, as a renewed token of the deep and anxious interest constantly evinced by your Majesty in the welfare of your subjects, and in whatever may tend to promote the improvement, elevation, and refinement of their intelligence, position, and feelings. "1 That your Majesty may long see your eare and solictude for their welfare gratefully acknowledged by a loyal, prosperous, and religious people, that you may enjoy every blessing and happiaess of which your exalted station 1i susceptible, and that you may eventully attin a highe, a:d more enduring crown is our earnest prayer. " Given under the common seal of the said mayor, alderaen, and burgesses of the said borough, this 30th day of June, 1857. " STIEPHEN HEELIS, Mayor." To this Her* Majesty made the following brief reply: '5 I am much gratified by the assurance of devoted attachment which you have conveyed too me in your address' and which I receive as an additional proof of the univertal feeling of loyalty prevailing within and around this great city. ": I sincerely thank you for the affectionate wishes vwhich yon have expressed for my happiness, and for that of my "It #ffords me the highest satisfaction to be present on lis occasion, and to assure you of the deep interest which I feel in the success of an undertkidng which reflects SD much credit on its promoters, and is so weRl adapted, not onlyto&delight, but to ihstruct and improve, all who visit the valuable 'treasures of art collected vithin this build- ng-11 The Mayor and Corporation of Salford were then presesnted in the usual form. D)uing the whole o'f the time that this oeremonid wras en~acting the rain fell in torrents, and pattered on the roof EO asalmost to drown all other sounds. Hor Majesty, preceded by the Executive Committee, and followed by the other members of the Royal famaily and their suite, then proceeded to examine the galleries deroted to the works of the ancient and modem masters. This inspection was -of -the most- striotly private character, and none but th6se we have mentioned accompanied the Roval visitors. After the inspea; tion of the Ancient Gallery Her Majesty proceeded o thereception-room, wrhere a Umost sumptuous ~luncheon, served on gold plate, Ahad been p?repared for the Royal partyby MIr; Donaltd, the enterpris ing restorateur to the Exhibition. Having partaken of this repast, the inspection of the Gallery of Modem Masters was proceeded with. This didnot terminate till past 2 o'clock, when Her MIajesty againreturned to the Central Hall, and amid the same enthusistic demonstrations of affectionate loyalty was conducted down to the Reception-room, and took her departure with the same ceremonies and Royal salutes as had welcomed her arrival. The instant the Royal party had fairly departed a rush was made at the refreshment department, which nothing but the fact of Mr. Donald having provided for some 16,000 hungry visitors would have enabled him to mneet. At 4 o'clock the general public were admitted on payment of the usual shilling fee. A Large number availed themselves of the opportunity, but less t han would have been the case if the weather had not been so thoroughly unfavourable. After'the Qtieen's arrivalit rained more or less heavily, with little intermission, throughout the day. The Royal party retumed to Woraley Hall by the same route through Manchester, but at a very rapid rate.
TFHE FRIG:RTFUL ACCIDENT ON THB NORTIF KENT RAILWAY. Yesterday morning the relatives and frien,ds of the U1 persons who were kIlled on the North Rent Railway on Sumday night, attended at the Plough Tavern, Lewisham, forthe purpose of identifying the bodies before the coroner's jury. Shortly after 10 o'clock Mr. C. J. Carttar, coroner for West Kent, arrived, and a jury composed of the prncipal tiadesmen of the neighbourhood was sworn. The Coroner proceeded to -reid over the names of the deceased as foUllwo :-John Ballinger, aged 26, carpet-bag maker, Ellizabeth asllinger, 30, and Edith Ballinger, aged montbs, wife and child of the above, of 37, Shaftesbury. place, city; Thomas Frankdlin, 21, of 15, Great Maze-pond, Borough; Horatio Turner, 16, of 56, Brook-street, Westsquare, Lambeth f Thomas 'William Turner, 27, hairdresser, St, Mary-at-Hil], city; Thomas Dalton, pianoforte maker, 45, Aldenham-street, St. Paneras; William ightingale, 29, pressman, Sream's-buildiuigs, Chancery-lane; Annie Willcox, 53, and Lary Ann Howe, 26 (sisters), of Walworth; and Francis Drake, 52, of 2, West-place, Nelson. street, Long-lane, Bermondsey, carpenter. Mx. Robinson, from the law-office of the Soutlx-Eastern? Railway Company, attended to watch the proceedings; Mr. Solomon, solicitor, for the husbanad of the deceased, Ms. Willcox. and her siter, Mr Howe; and Mr. Burgon for dftf&y~aa Whifbir, the diiveraie d¶feniaii of t nlglne causmng the disaster. Mfr. Smiles, secretary to the SouthE astern Eailway Company, aud.Mr. Coles Child, one of the directors, were also present during the proceedings. The Coroner, in addressing the jury, said that it was unyeceseary. for him to detail at any length their duties as murymen. as most of them had' before appeared in that capa¢ity on previons occasions. The sad and long list of names he had just read over to them was the result, as they were all avare, of a most lamentable disaster which had occurred late on Sunday night. Their duty, as jurymen, would beto inquire into the circumstances which had led to such melancholy and fatal results. The jury then proceeded to view the bodies, and after a Thort absence ±eturned, when the following persons were celled and spoke to the identity of the deceased persons:William Gross, tteel engraver, of Wellington-street, City- road, identified the bodies of John Ballinger and Elizabeth ' andEdith, his wife and child. Henry Turner, of Kennington-lane, identified the body of Horatio Tarner, his brother. * Eliza Anne Turner, gf 71, Snow--ill, identified the body of Thomas WillainmTurner as that of her brother. George Franklin, of 15, Great Maze-pond, Borough, night porter at St. Thomass Hospital, identi.ied the body of hlsson,ThomasFranldin. Thiswitness,itwillbe remembered, was engaged in attending and carrying persons injured by -the disaster'into St. Thomas's -Hospital until S o'clock on iXonday morning, when the melancholy tidings were conveyed to him that his own son (the deceased} wa-s a passen,ger by the train, and that his lifeless body. was lying at Lewisham. Thomas. WiUcox, coach broker, of 8, New-street, Borough, identified the bodies of his wife and her sister, ..Mrs. Annie Wilcox and lary Ann Howe. W aillim Nightingale, of BreaWs-buildings, Chancerylane, identified the body of William Henry Nightingale as that of his sou. James Dalton, servant to Sir F. Madden, Bart., British Museum, identified the body of his brother, Thomas iDalton. Thomas Drake, mason, of 79, St. John-street, Smithfield, identified the body of his father, Francis Drake. The whole of the bodies bein thus identified, Mr. Robinson said that, Hr. Bodkin being unable to attend that 'day, he was 'directed to ask that the inquiry might be adjourned. Mr. Burgon said, attending as he did for the two .men then in custody on a serious charge, he was desirous that evidence should be at once proceeded with. One of the guards, Willianm Wiley, had undergone a lengthened examination before the police magistrate on the previous day, but he had no wish to oppose the application, providing thevwitnesses who were to be examined were kept apart and not tampered with. The Coroner said he wbuld isue his order that this should be done. His opinibn was that the witnesses should keep, from commhicating to each other anything they had to say untU it was received as evidenoe. The applieation made for adjournment was a' very proper one, although at the same time the inquiry ought not tor. long delayed. Mr. Smiles mid, under the eircumstanees, if there was any objection to an adjournment, the railway company would weive the applcation. The Coroner said, he had received two letters from persons anxious to 'come forward as witnesses, neither of wihom was then present. He thought an adjournment advisable, when it would be found the inquiry would be conducted with more facility. Mr. Solomon having expressed concurrence in the eoroner's observations, an adjournment took place until Friday next.

PARALIAMENTARY INTELLIGFENCE HOUSE OF LORDS, TUESDAY, JuNZ 30. Tho LoRD CHSANCELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at b o'clock. Lord LtSICGH presented a petition from certain inhabi. tants of the town of Leamington, in Warwickshire, agalnst the alteration of the Oaths Bill, stating at the same time that he did not agree with the prayer of the petition. Petitions against the Oaths Bill were presented by the Earl of EGLINTOUN from places in Scotland. A petition in favour of the BiU was presented by Lord BROUGEIAM from the mayor and oorporationof HulL ALLEGED REVIVAL OF THE SLAVE TR&DE. Lord BROUGHA AM wished to ask a question of his noide filend (the Earl of Clarendon) relative to a subject which had excitedmuchalarmainongthosewho,likehiaaself,werefriends cf theAfrican race, and who hoped they had seen the end of that great scourge, the slave trade. It was understood that a body of West India planters had approached the noble viscount at the head of the Government, and had urged him to facilitate the importation into our colonies of free negroes-from the coast of Africa. It was also understood that measures of the same sort were c-intemiplated by the colonial interests of France and Spxin, and it was even stated that the Emperor Napokon bad given permission to a house at Marseilles to fit out an expedition for importing 20,000 free negroes, as they were called, into the F reach colonies. One vessel, it was alleged, had already sailed to Quidah, on the coast of Africa, well known as a slave-trading >ort-the very port, indeed, from which the King of Dahonmey formerly carried on that infernal traic. No wonder, then, that alarm had been excited at the prospect of such an expedition to the port of Qaidah, with the professed object of enabng negroes to take ship and beconveyed over to the French colonies. It was well known that one of the most remarkable acts of the life of the first Napoleon was his decree for puttiig down the French slave trade-our ancient allies, the Bourbons, havingaltogetheromitted totake sucha course. He felt asemed that the present Emperor of the French would not, by pursuing an opposite course, tarnish the glory of a policy which reflected so much honour upon his illustrious predecessor. It was also said that the importation of free negroes into Cuba was to be encouraged by the Spanish Government. Now, there was a great difference between any measure having for its object the importation of free negroes into Cuba upon the one hand, and a measure the object of which was their importation into the Erench or the English colonies upon the other. In the case of the latter slavery hd for EOime time been abolished, so that free negroes could not be enslaved after their importaeon. The free negroes who were inmported into Cuba, howvever, might in reality be compelled to undergo a state of endless bondage, and that being the case he hoped his noble friend at the head of the Gaovernment would be enabled to give him some assurance that the new Government of the Havannah was treading in the footsteps of those among its predecessors who had shown a disposition to put down the slave trade, and was not following the example of those by whom a contrary policy had been pursued. That a disposition existed in Brazil to put an end t0 the disgraceful trafflo in slaves he entertained no doubt, and the course which the Government of that country had taken in reference to the subject was such as in his opinion redounded greatly to its credit. When persons emigrated from this country to the colonies care was taken that they shouldbeprovidedwith sufflicientaccommodationonboardthe vessels in which tbey were conveyed. Medical attendancowas afforded them, and a vigilant superintendence was exercised at the various custom-houses in their regard, security being taken that they should be landed at the port to which they intended to emigrate. In the case of those free negroes, however, who were to be shipped on the coast of Africa no such precautions would be taken, and the consequence would be that great abuses would atise. Such a state of things should not, he contended, be allowed to prevail. Security should be taken that those negroes shouldbe landod at the port for which they were bound, and that whenever they became dissatisfied with their new position they should be enabled to return to their own country. Since the abolition of the slave trade, what he might term the innocent commerce of Africa had increased to a considerable extent. In the year 185 upwards of 1,500,0001. worth of goods had been exported from this country to those ports in Africa which were not in our own possession or under the dominion of France, while geeds to the value of 250,0001. had been exported to Sierra Leone and other English settlements on. the African coast. Now, nothing could, in his opinon, have a greater tendency to check that growing commerce than the encouragement of the traffc in slaves, and he hoped, therefore, to receive from the Goverment some assuranee both as to the intentions of the Spauish and Portuguese Governments, and as to the project which had been brought under the notice of his noblefriend at the head of the Government. The Earl of CLARENDON, who was very indistinctly heard, expreesed his almost entire concurrence in the observations which had just fallen from his noble and learned friend. He regretted, however, that he was not in a position to give an answer to the various questions which the noble and learned lord had put to him, because, although the noble and learned lord had given him notice that he was about to call his attention to the slave trade, he had not mentioned to him the particular branch of the subject to which his remarks would be directed. He had certainly seen by the public prints that a deputation had waited upon hiis noble friend at the head of the Government in cOnnexion with the question, but he was not quite aware of the precise nature of the proposal which had been made to his noble friend, or of the answer which he had given to that deputation. He felt, however, perfectly assured from the antecedents of his noble friend, and from the energy which he had always evinced in the suppression of the traffic in slaves, that hewould give no encouragementlto any propositionby the operation of which that traffic wou ld be likely to bo increased. As regarded the ship to which his noble and learned friend had referred as having sailed from Marseilles tc- Quidah for the importation of free negroes, Her Maiesty's Government had had no officialinformationof the circumstance, and a ship could hardly have sailed from Marseilles for such a purpose without their receiving some information on the OXFORD UNTVERSITY BILL. The Earl of CA RNARVON presented a petition against the second clause of this BilL The Earl of HIARROWBY, after presenting petitions in favour of the Bill, moved that it should be read a second time. One of the objects of the Bil was to enable the commissioners to consolidate the foundation of Mr. John Mohel with the old foundation of Queen's College, and by the other part it was intended to prolong the powers of the University Commission for six months. Last session he had asked their lordships to give their assent to a Bill to prolong the duration for a year of the commission, as it had been found that the amount of business could not be gone through in the time for which the commission was originally oreated. The original duties of the commission would aU be discharged by the time that year had expired, for out of the 20 colleges ordinances had been framed and had been passed into statutes for 14, and in regard to the remaining six there was only one with regard to which any diffioalties had been experienced, and those difficulties would, it was expected, soon disappear. It had been found, however, that within the year parties who might be disposed to object to the ordinances framed for them would not be able to avail themselves of the opportunity provided by the provision in the original Act, which declared that the ordinances should be laid before Parliament for 40 days before they became statutes, and it was therefore not thought right that the commission should be allowed to die away, thus leaving the parties without the means of remonstrating which Parliament had intended to give them. It was therefore provided in this Bill that the commission should be extended for six months. The Earl of DEBBY did not rise to offler any ob-ection to the prolongation of the commission, but he hoped that this would be the only prolongation asked, for nothing could be more inconvenient than the indefinite prolongation of suoh powers as these possessed by the conmi8sioners. H3is object in rising was to call the attention of his neble friend and their lordshlps to one of the provisions in the ordinances framed for Oriel College which had been laid on the table of the Hlouse, by which, contrary to the originalintentions of the founder, all consideration of the pecuniary circumstances of the applicant for the benefits of the foundation were excluded. No doubt, in the original University Act, there was a power given enabling the commissioners to modify or abolish all preferences; but it was also provided that the commissioners should frame ordinances in conformity wlth the main design and intention of the founders. Undoubtedly there were certain of those intentions from which it would only be just and reasonable in the present day to requ-re an exemption. Be did not pretend to deny that the intention of Parliament was that there should be full power vested In the commissioners to do away with preferences arising from place of birth, founder's kin, and other unfounded preferences of a like nature. In that Parliament certainly went beyond what he should have been dilsposed to propose, because, provided that the original intentions of the founder wore not unreasonable, not *citsr bonos mores, nor impracticable in the present day, it was not a sufficient motive for doing away with them that according to the existing practice of the present day it was not expedient to carry them out. Parliament had undouL-tedly authorized the commission to deviate from the original intentions of the founders, bat he apprehended that-that was only in cases where the preferences were founded upon garoumds which could not fairly be substantiated in the prenk day. That to which he desired to call the attention of tkeir lordships was a preference which was applicabl to all time, and which he believed was at the foundation of the lnstitatison nowunder consideration. In fhie statutes of Oriel theta were three circumstances which were to be inquired into-first, the moral character of the applicants; secondly, the pecuniarv circumstances; and, lastly, the aptitude for stufy and the deaire for proftciency. The orinai .statute ran thus:- " Hoc etiam in edem domo specinliter observari volumnus, ut circa eos qui ad hujusmodi eleencosyna; participium admittendi fuerint dillgenti solicdt.dine oaveatsr no qui priuter honestos, castos, pacificos, humiles, indcgontes, ad studium habiles, proficere volentes, eb ritea electos reci- Ofacourse the commissioners would have no ,iesire to set aside the moral character of the applicant; but, so far as the ordinance went, the sole provision made by it was to have reference to the scholarship of the appliea nt, to be decided by a university examination. The questiol' of the pecuniary circumstances was not orly ignored, but expressly prohibited from being taken into consideration. There could be no words more strong than those which he izd aquoted io indicate that it was the intention of the founLer fnat those who were to profit by the advantages of the founa'elation should be persons of small pecuniary means. There would be some difficulty in explaining the word i7dWqens, but he did not apprehend that there could be any difficulty In the commissoners explaining it. In this very, ordinance they had undertaken to doit,inauch as in maldng some small provision for the scholars the had very properly interpolated the words "to guch deserving persons as the electors ehall ascertain to be in need of support at the University." Their lordshipe might depend -upon It that from the tmo of jh1 ~gd;ta on thQ taoresenb day lletbing had tesded so much to encourage a liberal education among the middle nnd humbler classes ol society as the eleemosynary system which the present Bll would Eo materially interfere with. The statute originally framed by the commissioners on this matter was amcopted by the college, and the result of that statute would have been to carry out as a whole the original intentions oif the founder; but it was said that in conseo quence s a private communication from -a minority of the college the commissioners caused the statute to be altered, and Vrat the very ordinance which the college had accepted 'ween so far as absolutely to forbid is from taking i%lto consideration those pecuniary circumstances which the founder had laid down. The newlv-proposed ordisanceprovided that in elections to fellowshipa withinthe collegI "No person shall be either entitled to a preference or inelgible by reason of his place of birth, or by reasnn of any statute or rule limiting the number of fellowships tenable atny one time by natives of the same town, city, county, diocess, or other place, or by reason of his pecuniary circumstances," &c. The statute therefore provided that it should be one of the main conditions on which elections took place that the circumstances of birth or parentage ware not to be taken into consideration by way of preference. Now, he must say that this seemed to him a strange way of carrying out the expressed wishes of the founders, but strange as it was, it was to be sent down to the college to be acted on, and to be forced on a majority of that college in the face of their expressed views in opposition to it. (Hear.) He bhlieved they were injuriously affecting the character of the college and the IJniersity by striking out the provision respecting povorty. Unfortunately, the powers of the commissioners were so ample, and the means of resistance on the part of the college so small, that whatever the former declared to he law must almost necessarily be so. It was not easy to plead that the provision would be injurious to the college as a place of learning, because it was possible that persons more intelligent, more learned, and more brilliant than before might be educated under th1 e now rule- bat the members of the college maintained that it would injuriously interfere with the arrangements of the founder, and that it would cause a reduction of the numbers educated under the original foundation. It was worthy of observationthatunder the old statutes a sum of 4,5001. a-year was available for the education of the class of persons named in the foundation; but this fund had in great measure been taken away and applied to theestablishment of professorships and variousotherpuroses. Instead of 4,5001. a-year there was giventofour humble scbolars the miserable pittances of bOl. a-year each, or 2401. (Hear, hear.) The new ordinance was on the table of the House, but their lordships had no power to interfere, except by an address to the Crown. He did not propose to make any motion on the subject, but he had thought it his duty to bring the matter under the notice of their lordships, and he hoped they would hear from some one of the commissioners present an explanation of the dircumstances which had led to so extraordinary an innovation upon what were the clear designs of thefounder. (Hear, hear.) The Bishop of DURHAM, who was all but inaudible in the gallery, was understood to say, that circumstances had changed much since the original statutes were framed. In former days, when youths of 13 or 14 years of age were elected to fellowships, it was in order to enable them to study, but now it was the duty of the fellows to teach. It was true that Oriel College might have departed from the ancient spirit of her statutes, but it had been only to render them more conformable to the wants of the age. Suppsin that of several candidates the most eligible in point of iatelectual and other qualifications happened to possess larger pecuniary means than the others, surely that circumstance ought not to be held as a disqualfication. The consequence of a rigid adherence to such a principle would be to provide the students with inferior tutors and compel them to have recourse to private teachers. The old rules as to indigensks et humilee had become obsolete long ago, and it could not correctly be said that the poor students hadbeen placed in a worse position by the new ordinance. The Bishop of ST. ASAPH, as one who, under God, owed all the advantages he had gained in life to an eleemosynary foundation, was desirous of stating generally the description of the foundations which should exist in the university. He thought the noble earl opposite would see there were reasons why pecuniary considerations should be entirely excluded from the selection of fellows. University foundations were divided into fellowships, scholarships, and exhibitions. In the latter case he could not help believing there would be great advautage in making poverty an element of consideration in conferring them, and exhibitions might wisely be giventothe sons of poor clergymen,to enable them to prosecute their studies at the university. With respect to fellowships, however, the case was different; the fellows were the governing body, and should be selected from the most capable men, without regard to their pecuniary means. In the intermediate step of scholarships he thought poverty ought not to be taken into consideration. Lord REDESDALE thought it was extremelydesirable that foundations should be maintained for the encouragement of persons of small means to reside at the universities, and complained that poverty was specially excluded in the words of the ordinance. The Bishop of LONDON believed they were much indebted to the Royal Commission upon the particular point in question. It was a difficult thing to compare merit and poverty. He thought that the very point that was objected to was a wise arrangement on the part of the Royal Commissioners. It would be unjustifiable that poverty should be altogether excluded from consideration in the ordinances, but then the real and not the nominal intentions of the founders ouaht to be carried out. These intentions were that poor young men should be able to study in their early youth. The emoluments possessed by these colleges having, however, greatly Increased sineo their foundation, and the colleges having grown and become in part the governing body of the university, and having to furnish teachers for it, the Royal Commissioners were, he thought, wise in saying that they would not allow these teachers to be chosen on the ground of poverty. It was right, no doubt, to multiply exhibitions, but when you came to elect publia teachers it was not right to select them on the ground of poverty. The Bill was read a second time. The Insurance on Lives (Abatement of Income-tax) Con. tinuance Bill and the aley Borough Incorporation Bill were read a second time. 'T.he County Cess (Ireland) Bill and the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) Bill were read a third time and passed. The Town Bye-laws Revision Bill went through committee. RENIOVAL OF IRISE PAUPERS. The Earl of DONOUGhMORE rose to cal the attentien of their lordships to the laws in force for tho removal of Irish-born poor from parishes in England and Wales; and to ask whether it was the intention of the Government to propose any amendment in those laws. In 1854 the Government now in office proposed a measure for the abolition of the law of settlement in English parishes. It was then admitted that if Parliament were to enact that the power of removal of English paupers should cease it would be highly unjust to continue to remove Irish paupers from English parishes. After the measure to which he had referred had been passed, a committee, composed of members of the other House of Parliament, had sat for two sessions upon the subject to which it related. That committee had taken a large amount of.evidence, and hadagreed to a report in which they recommended that some relaxation should be made in the law of removal as it now stood. They had, in the first place, recommended that thev warrant of removal should be made out in open court; secondly, that the depositions of the witnesses on whore testimony the warrant] was granted should be taken down in writing; that a copy of the warrant should be sent to the board of guardians of the parish in Ireland to which the pauper happened to belong, and that power should be given to the umon authorities in Ireland to appeal against the drder, and to make use of the rates of the union in the prosecution of that appeaL They had also advised the adoption of other relaxations, and among them the reduction of the period entitling a pauper to the privilege of settlement in this country from five to three years. Such was the report of the committee, but without adverting to it further he might inform their lordships that the Irish Poor Law, in connexion with the question of settlement, differed materially from that which prevailed in this country. In Ireland, indeed, there was no law of settlement at alL The Irish Poor Law enacted that wherever a person became destitute there he should be relieved, no matter from what quarter of the world he might have come. But to revert to the system in this country, he should wish to point out to their lordships the practical results of the mode in which it worked. Irish paupers came over here in large numbers, and were employed for harvest purposes andin the more severe forms of labour. Indeed, their services in that capacity had now become almost necessary to England. What was the consequence? Young men and young women came over. They resided here for a period of 15, 20, or 25 years. They married and had families in this country, yet after having spent the best part of their lives in contributing to the increase of English capital and to the production of English wealth, they were, the moment that szckness or accident might have reduced tbom to poverty, liable to be told by the Poor Law authorities that in England they were not entitled to relief. (Hear, hear.) Well, what was their position when they were sent back to Ireland aLfter the lapse of the period of 20 or 25 years to which he had just alluded? The great probability was that when they returned to their native place they found that their parents were dead, thait the other members of their family had emigrated, and he might state of his own knowledge that he knew instances in which paupers sent back to Ireland had been unable, in the neighbourhood in which they had been born, to discover a single relative or friend. (Hear, hear.) But that was not the only mode in which the present system of removal operated as a hardship. Sickness and misery of every kind was endured by those unfortunate persons on board the steamers into which they were ruddsed. The way in which they were transported across channel was such as had that evening called for their lordahips' svympathy in the case of the African slaves, and when they arrived upon the Irish coast they were landed upon the crowded quays of Dublin, Belfast, or Waterfoird, frequently amid aU the inclemency of a winter morning, and at a distance, perhaps, of 100 miles from the parish to which they originally belonged. (Hear, hear.) Now, that was a state of things which, in his opinion, loudly caUed for the interference of the Legislature. He was perfectly aware that, owying to the great number of Irish paupers who had, during the famine of 1847, settled upon the western coast of England, the Poor Law authorities of Liverpool might object to any proposal which they would be saddled with a populathon of thatescription. But 1847 was an exeptional period. The soclal condition of Ireland had since then been greatly changed, and, even though a famine should again ocur in that country, it was by no means probable that that state of things would be brought about of which the Poor Law authorities of Liverpool complained. He usted, therefore, that the Government would take the ,Rnblet into their serious consideration. In the session of iOOtheyM had proposed a measure with respect to it, Ia wh.'Oh be regretted tat tey had not persevered. That meas ~are ha, it was true, met with a determined opposition from 5,rme members of the other House of Parlizament who were oLented withl Ireland. He was, however, of opinion that a difl "rent course should have been adopted upon the occasion, an-4 that those gentlemen shouldhave accepted th Bill as an insAlllRt of t11959 improvement in the present law whiclr tney were entitled to expeot. He should, in conchisior, ask his noble friend the President of the ConncP. whether the Government had any measure under their consideration by means of which the grievances to ilAch he had called their lordships' attention might be removed, and the recommendations of the committee of 1855 carried into effect? (flear, hear.) The Earl of DESART tendered his thanks to his noble friend who had just spoken for the manner in which he hal brought the subject under the notice of the House, and expressed a hope that the Government would introduce soma: meas ire to amend the present law of removal. Earl GRANVILLE concurred with the noble earl opposite (Lord Dononughmore), in thinking that great injastice was sometimes inficted upon Irish-paupers under the operation of the existing system. The sill of 1856, however, to which the noble; earl had alluded, which had been iatroduced uapon the recommendation of the committee of 1855, and which had for its object the removal of that injustice, had been most violently opposed, not only by English and Sicotch members, but also by the representatives of Ireland. (Hear, hear.) It had in consequence become quite impossible to pass it through the other House of Parliament, and he did not therefore think it would be wise upon the part of the Government, when many important measures were pending, to bring forward a Bill which would not be likely to obtain the support even of those whose assistance it was most natural to expect. (Hear, hear.) Thoe Marquis of CLAen RICADE bore testimony to the fact that great inconvenience resulted from the present state of the laiw. In reply to the observation of Lord Donoughmore, that there was sno lavr of settlement in Ireland, he remarked that such was not exactly a correct statement of the case, inasmuch as the chargeability of a pauper upon an electoral division operated to some extent as a law of settlement. What was required in Ireland, he contended, was not alone an alteration of the law of removal in the case of paupers sent over to that country from England, but in the working of the law within the limits of Ireland itself. As things now stood a pauper landed in Ireland became at once chargeable on the rates of the port at which he happened to disembark, notwithstanding that Mayo or some other county might oa the place to which he originally belonged. The Earl of CLANCARTY considered the subject as one of great importance, and as calling for the interference of the Government. Lord STUART DE DECIES mentioned two cases in proof of the unjust operation of the existing law. The first of these f.ses was one which had occurred within the last year, in which an Irishman who had been 18 years resident in this country, and who had failed at the end of that time to obtain employment, had been shipped across to Ireland and was now chargeable on the Union of Dungarvan. The second was a case which had oocurred within the same period, in which an Englishwoman with a family of 'dve or si children, who had been deserted by her husband, and had consequently been reduced to a state of destitution, was now chargeable upon the same union without an,y possibility of her beig sent back to her own country. But that wass not all; she and her family were almost the only Protestant paupers in the union, and the Protestant chaplain, who had 101. a-year assigned for attending to the spiritual wants of those Protestants who were in the workhouse, had lately applied for an increase of 101. a-year to his salary, while -his duties in return would con,sist in administering spiritual consolation to one family only. Such cases were productive of considerable hardship. and he therefore trcsted the Government would nexrt session intreduce a measure to obviate their recurrence. Lord MONTEA!GLE also pressed the subject upon the consideration of the Government. The relations between England and Ireland in reference to the supply of labour had become somewhat reversed of late years, so that instead of there being any likelihood that there would he an influx of Irish labourers into this country he believed the suoply would not be found to equal the demand. The Poor taw authorities here, therefore, need entertain no apprehension upon the score of being deluged with Irish paupers. Lord RWEDESDALEssidthat one and all of thenoble lords who had spoken upon the subject agreed that an alteration of the lAw whinch should be favourable to Ireland ought to be made. The reciprocity, however, proposed was a thoroughly Irish reciprocity-that was to say, it was a reciprocity entirely on one side. (A. laugh.) There was more money raised in England by poor-rates to spend upon Irish paupers than even for English paupers, and undoubted' the converse was not true with regard to Ireland, and me. t certainly the pecuDiary advantage was at present on the sidee of lreland. (Hlear, hear.) Aifter a few words from the hMarquis of WESrsATH the subject dropped. Their lordships adjourne4 at 20 minutes to 8 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, TuESDAY, JUiB 30. The SPEBA took the chair at 12 o'clock. BODMIN ELECTION PETITION. The SPEAKER announced that he had received a lettcr from the parties who had petitioned against the election for the borough of Bodmnin, stating that it was not their intention to proceed with the petition. The order for referring the petition to a select committee was then read and discharged. Mr. WYLD said, that he was averse to the withdrawal cf this petition, in which he and his constituents had been grosey libelled, without having an opportunity of defending themselves. He gave notice that he should take the liberty of calling the attention of the House to this subject at the commencement of the evening sitting. PRIVATE BUSINESS. The following Bills were read a third time and passed:Dorset Central Railway Bill, Fife and Kinross Railway BiL Eaden ond Todmorden Roads Bil, Kinross-shire Railway Bill, Leslie Railway Bill, Stratford-upon-Avon Gas Bill, Watchet EHarbour Bil, West Somerset Mineral Railwray Bill. SOUTH-EASTERN RAILWAY (GREENWICH JUC- TION TO DAEtTEORD, Ac.) BIL On the order of the day for the consideration of this Lord A. PAGET moved that the Bill be ordered for a third reading, expressing his surprise that an opposition was threatened to.the motion. The committee sat 15 days, and were unanimous in favour of the Bil. Sir E. DERING said, that from the year 1853 onwards the principle of competition in the communication between London and Dover had been affirmed by Parliament; and on the faith of that decision the East Kent Railway Company had carried out extensive works between Strood and Dover. The importance of connecting the Arsenal at Woolwich and the national establshments at Chatham with Dover had also been repeatedly recognized; but now it was sought to hand over the whole continental traffic as well as the entire railway system of Kent to the South-Ear'ern Company. Tho committee declared in their report that the adoption of the East Kent line would be very prejudicial to the South-Eastern Company, and they had required a pledge from that company that it would, next session, apply to Paliament for a Westend terminus. Moreover, the committee acknowledged that they agreed to this Bill with some reluctance; and he, therefore, thought the measure should be deferred till another year. For these reasons he begged to move that the further consideration of the BIll be postponed for three months. Colonel FREESTUN stated that the committee were unanimous, and hoped that the House would stand by their report. Mr. OSBORNE said, that the committee had arrlved at their conelusions on mistaken grounds. If they had been all directors of the South-Eastern Railway they could not have been more careful of the interests of that company. (A laugh.) He did not, however, impugn their motives, but must suppose that, having sat for a fortnight in this howeather, their intellects had become obfuscated. (Renewed laughter.) Their chairman, speaking for the committee, said, that their decision had been come to rather reluctantly. So much for their boasted unanimity. Besides, they admitted they weze not altogether satisfied that the scheme of the South-Eastern Railway Company would be for the accommodation of the public. The directors of that company could enter into no pledge respecting a West-end terminus without first consulting their shareholders. The Bill ought therefore to be postponed. Mr. RICH said, that the Secretary to the Admiralty had shown a bias in favour of the views of his constituents. Dover had been mixed up with every possible opposition to the South-Eastern Company. The interests of the public were not necessarily inconsistent with those of that com- any. The East Kent Company was called independent, bat it had been in negotiation with the South-Eastern Company ever since its origin, its object being to screw the best terms it could obtain from the latter body. Its deputvchairman was the late Mr. J. Sadleir, of dishonourable notoriety, and its contractor had failed. Legitimate com- titlon was to be encouraged, but not that got up by interested attorneys, stock-jobbers, and contractors. Sir B. BRIDGES supported the amendment on the ground of public convenience and public safety. Ten or 12 lives had been lost within the last few days from the overcrowded traffic of the very line which the East Kent Company was intended to relieve. Sir B. HALL recommended that the Bill should stand over till another year, in order that the question mighs bh further considered by the two companies, when a report Im ht be presented free from the inde6ision and reluctance wh4ch marked the present one. The line proposed by the Bill;would have its terminus at London-bridge, which was already overcrowded, whereas the other company's railway would go to the West-end, and thereby divert a portion of the traffic at the former locality. Mr. BENTINCK thought the House would neglect itS duty if, after the lamentable accident which had just arisen from the over-crowded state of the North Kent line, it did not refrain from sanctioning any other scheme until it had time to consider whether the recurrence of such a catastrophe might not be prevented by the construction of a railway arriving at a different terminus. Mr. GILPIN, as a director of the South-Eastern Railway Company, defended the report of the committee, asserting that if the line now sanctioned by them had been carried out no such accident as they were then deploring would have occurred. It did not require a member to sit in a committee in order to have his wits " obfuscated." The language of some of those who had opposed the Bill that day created a presumption that their own minds were in that mfortunate condition. (A laugh.) Mr. HOPE protested against the late accident being used as an argument adl inviciam against the Bill. All the opposition offered to the measure by the people of Dover arose from their eagerness to get to mndon an hour or two sooner. (Ironical cries of "HEear, hear.") He did not blame them tor that, butths was a poor reason for sanctioning a competition that would ruin both of the rival companies, and disable them from providing forthesafetyand comfor3 of the travelling public. Colonel FRENCH anbmxdverted on the interference of two members of the Government with this question. Sir J, 15 Ijg 9omprisied 9Z to intxod4utioa of th9 unfortunate Mr. John Sadleir's name to prejudice the E13st Rent Railway Company. Air. WATKINS condemned as suicidal the policy of impoverishing existing railway companies by exposing them to a ruinous rivalry. There was nothing in the report itself -with which the liouse had alone to do-that showed the committee to have come to their decision with reluctance. The line which they had recommended was necessary to the convenience as weU as the safety of the South-Eastern Company's traffio. The system of canvessing members to vote, whether for or agaiast private Bils, which had been resortad to in this instance, was disgracefaL Mr. T. DUNCOMBE thought, from the remarkable concert which existed between the Admiralty and the Board of Works, that there had been some canvassing on the Treasury bench on 'his occasion. Mr. COBBETT vindicated the conduct of the committee, who, dariug their absence that day on other business, had been very unfairly attacked, if not insulted. Mr. FITZROY pointed out that the rival company had not deemed it necessar for its OWa interests to petition against this scheme. Without aperoving entirely of the terms of their report, there was no good reason for reversing the decision of the committee. The Earl of MARCH also defended the committee from the ridicule cast upon It by the Secretary to the Admi. ralty.. 'Ultimately, after nearly two hours of discussion, the amendment was negatived without a division, and the original motion agreed to. FINSBURY PARK (No. 2) BILL. The order for the resumption of the adjourned debate en the second reading of this Bil having been read, Mr. COX explained that sirnce the decision come to by the House on Taesday last the Metropolitan Board of Works had accepted that vote as tantamount to a refusal on the part of the House to grant the sum of 50,0001. towards the formation of the park. The board proposed to proceed with the Bill, and to tax the whole of the metropolis for the entire outlay. Sir J. SHELLEY and Mr. WLThrAIs withdrew their opposition to the Bil, and the second reading was then agreed to. BANKRUPTCY AND IOLVENCY (IRELAND) BILL. The House then went into committee on this Bill, and resumed the consideration of its numerous clauses at clause 153. Clauses up to 160 were agreed to. On clause 161, Mr. BLA)ND proposed to strike out certain words and to insert thefollowing :-" No action, suit, or other proceed. ing shall be taken by any creditor of a company without leave first had and obtained." An act of bankruptoy committed by a joint-stock company ought to have the same effect as a bankruptcy of partners, and the right of the creditors to sue individual shareholders should be limited. The ruinous consequences of the opposite principle had been aimnfuRy exemplified in the case of the Royal British Mr. J. FITZGERALD proposed to omit this clause altogether, and on the report to add clauses restricting the right of the creditor in case of bankruptcy to sue any member of a joint-stock companywithout the leave of the court, but at the sameetime giving the court certain powers to prevent a sbareholder from either removing his person from the jurisdiction pending the inquiry in bankruptcy, or from parting with his property. Mr. BLAND withdrew his amendment, and the clause was expunged. Clauses up to 346 having been agreed to, Mr. VANCE proposed to omit the arrangement clauses (from 347 to 357, both inclusive). The mercautile community were opposed to these clauses; and, in fact, the arrangement clauses of the existing bankruptcy law of Ireland had never been brought into practice. The clauses for arrangement by deed, now in operation in England, would be far preferable. He would not, however, press his amendment in the present state of the House. [There were not more than 8 or 10 members present.] Mr. J. EITZGERALD admitted that the arrangement clauses now in existence in Ireland were too complicated to work. He had taken pains to simplify them, retaining, however, the requisite safeguards against fraud. The amendment was then withdrawn, and the remaining clauses were agreed to. Several new clauses were also brought up and added to the BilL Some conversation took place as to the necessity of further discussion upon the compensation clauses and the provision for imposing a stamp duty, and it was ultimately arranged that an opportunity should be afforded for that purpose at a subsequent stage of the measure. The bringing up of the report was fixed for Monday next, and the House resumed. Mr. ELLIOT took the oaths and his seat for Roxburghshire. The sitting was then suspended till 6 o'clock. The sitting was resumed at 6 o'clock. PETITIONS. Petitions, in favour of the ballot, were presented by Mr. Serjeant KMGLAXs, from inhabitants of the city of Rochester; by Mr. ScnscDER, from the electors and other inhabitants of Norwich, with 575 signatures;! by Mr. BRADY, from the borough of Taunton; by Mr. PM=GTONr, from a meeting of delegates assembled at the Kineg's Arms, Palace-yard; from a public meeting of St. Mary's Ward, Blackburn, and from a public meeting of inhabitants of Blackburn.

A petition was presented by Mr. ROEBUCK frona electors of the western division of the county of Norfolk, complaining that at the late election certainletters were wlritten hythree noble lords who had territorial influence in that district, whereby the privileges of the doctors were infringed. The petitioners had requested him to move for a select committee to inquire into their alegations, but he didnotintendtodo anything (alaugh), because they were of too general a character. THE LITURGY. Lord R. GROSVENOR gave notice of his intention to move on the first vacant day, which would probably beeTaesday, July 28th, that an address be presernted to the Qaeen praying Her Majesty to be graciously pleased to appoint a commission for the purpose of considering whether the Liturgy of the Church of England be not capable of such modification in its arrangement of the services as to render It more profitable than it nowis for thereligious instruction and edification of the people. MIITARY EDUCATIOT. Sir DE L. EVANS postponed his motion with reference to this subject til the 21st of July. ORDTANCE SURVEY. On the motion of Mr. LIDDELL a return was ordered of the names of the parishes and places in Darham and Northumberland which have been surveyed upon the 25inch scale; distinguishing those portions of tCe survey which have been already published from those which yet remain unuublished. REGISTRATION OF TITLES. In answer to Mr. GBrnB, The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that the report of the commissioners appointed to consider the subjeot of the registration of titles to property in land was not presented to ser Majesty until, he beheved, four or five weeks ago. It was thought desirable that that report should be circulated, and that the criticisms of the profession thereon should be obtained, before steps were taken to embody the recommendations ofthe commissioners ina'Bil. If he hadseen the probabilityof passing a measure of suchgreat importance during the present session he should have been more eager to bring the subject before the House. le trasted, however that there would still be time to bring in a Bil before Parliament was prorogued, not with auy notion that it could be adequately discussed during the rermaiader of the session, but merely that it should lie on the table for consideration until next year. (Hear, hear.) Thermeasure wouldbe in accordance with the report of the commismissioners. (Hear, hear.) TRANSPORT OF TROOPS TO INDIA, Colonel FRENCH asked the right hon. baronet the First Lord of the Admiralty whether the Directors of the East India Company had applied to the Government for the use of vesteis to transport troops to India, whether that application had been refused, and whether, in the present emergen.iy, uny hired sailing vessels were to bce employed while some 'jf Ilour Majesty's stenmers wrere left idUe?9 Sir 0. WOOD said it was not true that any application had been made to the Admiralty by the East India Directors for the use of transport vessels. (Hear.) It was not the intention of the Government to send out any troops in Queen's vessels. Hired transports were more easily fitted up, and their services would be put in requisition. BODMIN ELECTION. Mr. WYLD stated that, inasmuch as the House did not seem disposed to give proper protection to the character of its members, it would he his duty, at another time and in another place, to avail himself of the ordinary forms of law in order to cear his own character, and that of his constitaents, from the stains which had been cast upon them by a certain election petition. THE BALLOT. Mr. H. BERKELEY rose to ask leave to introduce a Bill to causo the votes of the Parliamentary electors of Great Britain and LIeland to be taken by way of ballot. He knew not how this motion might be met to-night; he knew that the noble lord at the head of Her Majesty's Government was absent; but he knew, likewise, that that noble lord had said to many hon. members, some of whom desired to bring forward measures of electoral reform, " Wait, for I have a IReform BilL Lo, it looms inthe distance ! Behold, itisa great Reform Bill; and it shall, like Aaron's rod, which devoured up all other rods, devour all your smaller measures of Re. form." (Alaugh.) Hon. members, accordingly,hadwaited for that event. Now, those who advocated the ballot had not the least objection to wait, but they had an objection to do so without knowing what they were to wait for. (Hear, hear.) They objected to be treated somewhat after a nursery fashion-to be told that " they must open their mouths and shut their eyes, and see what the noble lord would send them." (Laughter.) Wait they would, but in order that they might know what they were waiting for he begged to propose a question to the occapants of the Treasury Bench. He saw two hon. members opposite who were probably the noble lord's locunm tenentes this evening, so he begged to ask them this specific question, "Is it the intention of Her Majestys Government to adopt the ballot as part of the Reform Bill next session?" (Hear, hear.) That was a very plain and straightforward question, and he trusted that he might have a straightforward answer, without those little flowers of diplomacy which were generaly sprinkled upon Ministeria replies. f this question wrer an swered in the affirmative he had nothing to do but to sit down, aad be thought the cheer with which such an announcement would be received would be echoed from eve-y part of England. If, however, on the contrary, he was met with a negative, then he had simply to lay his case in the best form he oould before the House. He now paused for a reply. [The hon. gentleman paused accordingly, but, as he remnained standing; apparently fearfal of losing his right to continue his speech, no other member could address the House. The thaaclor of theExchequer said,-"Ifmy hon. friend is really serious in asking"-ut then resumed his seat amid cries of " Order !"] Mr. BEREELEY presumed, after the little preliminary flourish of the right hon. gentleman, that the answer he had to give could not be plain " Yes," or " No." He supposed, then, that in default of such an answer he must take it for granted that silence meant dissent. (A laugh.) It was not, he presumed, the intention of the Government to adopt the ballot in their Reform Bill, whatever they might have determined as to the other questions which had been proposed to them. He thought, then,he was ,rfectlyjustifiedin bringing this impertant question bofor t e Hlouse to-night. (Hear.) He shouldnot upon this occasion urge any arguments in suppcrt of his motion, but he should content himself with taking the objections which had been last put upon record by hon. members, and he should endeavour to give some reply to them. Nothing could be more beautiful in theory thaa our electoral system, and nothing could be more hideous in practice. It was perverted, it was disorganized and all that the promoters ofthe balot sought to do was to re-establish it upon a proper basis. The case appeared to him to be most plain and palpable:-An elector was appointed to do a simple daty-to vote as he pleased, freely ancd indifferently; but he could not do that by voting in public, and "Therefore," said the supporters of thismetion, " let him vote in secret." (Hear, her.) That would seem to be a very simple test, yet it was met with the most strenuous opposition, and the governing body refusedto protect people at the polng-booth fron those malign infuences which beset them and which gave so many seats to a favoured class in that House: they would go any length, and would assent to any measure of reform rather than that. One of the best writers on the ballot had justly said that- " The aristocracy or governing classes of this country would rather yield uaiversal suffrage, and retain the control which open voting gives them at elections, than the most n oderate extension of the franchise with the ballot." Be (Mr. Berkeley) believed that to be the case, and he warned the coantry to beware of that spurious liberality which would extend the suffrage but refuse the ballot, because he believed that the alleged desire for an extension of the suffage was frequently only a pretence to get rid of the baBot. HIe had always maintained that the ballot was the alpha of all Parliamentary reform (hear, hear), and he asserted that if they would only give the elector protection at the polling-booth they would soon be able to run through the entire alphabet of reform down, to its omega. Now, he wouId endeavour to grapple with and to show the fallacy of the speeches of some hon. gentlemen on the hustings who had attacked the ballot and had at the same time given in thelr adhesion to ant extension of the suiEage. He had before him an extract from T1ie limes of April last, which contained the report of a speech made by Mr. Disraeli at Aylesbury. The great talent of the right hon. gentleman, his eloquence, his powers of reasoning, and the high position whih he held in that House must render every word that he said upon that subject as important as it was interesting. (Heas, hear.) Well, Mr. Disraeli started with this proposition,-" That everybody must agree that the ballot, with- out ain e2tenslon ot the sutffage, was an impossibility."l Now, he (Mr. Berkeley) was an humble individual in comparison with the right hon. gentleman, but he most peremp1 torily denied that proposition, and he asserted that he was backed and supported in his denial by some of the fi-st authorities, both of the past and of the present day. Sach, for example, had not been the opinion of Lord Durham, who wasin favour of a very great extension of the suffrage; such had not been the opinion of MIr. Charles Buller, who was also in favour of a great extension of the suffrage; and such had not been, and was not now, the opinion of Mr. George Grate, who also supported an extended franchise. He (Mr. Berkeley) went as far as Lord Durham did touching the extension of the franchise. He believed a very great extension to be necessary, but he was of opinion that the elector, whatever his franchise -might be, had a right to demand of the Legislature which enjoined upon him the performance of acertain duty that he should have adequateand full protection afforded him in the discharge of that duty; and he contended that they had no right to impose any duty upon an individual by law without effectually guarding that individual m the performance of such duty. (Hear, hear.) He next came to an equally bold, and, as he thought, equally incorrect assertion by the right hon. gentleman, "that the vote by ballot would be an intolerable tyranny over the nonelectors." In attemapting to refute these fallacies, which were, of course, admirably put forward by the right hon. gentleman, all their weak parts being carefullv concealed by most excellent words, it was necessary that they should look to first principles. NTow, the laws carrying out the intention of what was called the representative constitution of this country had defined the qualification of an elector, and his qualification being first defined his duty was also defined and with equal clearness-it was to select and to vote for such candidte as he might thin proper without fear of punishment, without hope of rewardr. Nobody, therefore; had a right to question his vote, or to visit him with after consequences. He (Mr. Berkeley) wras strongly of opinionr that they could not contravene that selfevident propasition, but if be wished to strengthen himself in the eyes of the, house he would call into court the late Sir E. .Peel, wihe said npon this subject "To whom is the constituent body responsibleI Is thereany responsibility of any conceivable kind, except the responsibility to God, to their own consciences, and to an, enlightened deliberate public opinion?' (Hear, hear.) That wasthe opinion of thelate Sir B. Peel,. and upon it he (Mr. Berkeley) was prepared to take his. stand. Since, then, the elector had the undoubtedprivilege of voting as he might think proper, for what purposE' :as open voting required ? For wbat purpose did they want; a record to be kept a,.gainst every man of bow he voted?What were they to gain by it according to the electoraL principles of our constitution? Was there any conceivable, thing which they could gain by open Toting which was fairhonest, and above board ? Did open voting affozd any test ofP an elector's having sold his vote or of his having been intimidated ? Did it afford any means of punisbhig a corrphb elector which secret voting did not equay confer? H e saietthat it did not, for be would undertake to prove that a convctian for bribery would be as attainable, if it took place,, under secret voting as under open voting. He definec opem. voting to be the ratification of a treaty betureen dishonest;mnen ; while secret voting was the prevention of the ratifica-' tion of that treaty, because it compelled one scoundrel todepend upon the vord of another. ("-Her," anda laughb In open votiDg the poll-book was the record by whiclK the intimidator convicted and punished his vctims. (Eear, hear.) The knowledge that that record was kept agaiusn; the electors induced thousands of men fully competent t3. be electors to refuse to be placed on the register. The knowledge of the existence ofthat record compelled thousands of men who were electors to refuse to go to the poll; and theknowledge of the existence of that record alsocompelledl tens of thousands of our countrymen to go to the pollthereto falsify their consciences and to tell a lie, to the greats detriment of their country, ir the face of their God; or, touse perhaps the better phraseology of the brilliantly-written. paper-the Examiner-it compelled the electors to go to thepoll there to tell a lie and to rend the incarnation of that lie to Parliament. {" Bear, hear," an laughter.) Mr. Disrael iold the Buckingham- asure farmers that to allow the electors to vote ib3 secret-and that he (Mr. Berkeley) contended was to vote. without itimidation as enjoied by law-would be imtolerable tyranny upon the non-electors. Now, this was assumiDg covertly that whichnohon. member, howeveraudaciou ,. dared to assume openly in that House-namely, that there' was a body of men an this country under whose control the' electors ought to be. It meant that or nothing. (Hear,. bear.) When it was said that electors would turn tyrants; over the non-electors if this secret voting was given them, that might be an argument for universal suffrage, but it; was no argumnent whatever against theballot. (Hear, hear.)It was an argument for universal suffrage, because if then non-electors were to have thle power to control the' electors, vwhy makce trants of them-why not rather give, them the franchise? H e did not think that that couldD be got out of. (Hear, hear.) Mfr. Disraeli, of the manor off Rughenden, in the county of Buckingham, could vote fonwhom he pleased; he was perfectly independent of every. body; but John Brown, of High Wycombe, was not indeo pendent enough to go against his tyrant. John Brown, therefore, naturally turned to Mr. Disraeli sad said, *You, are a man of great importance in the House of Commons an ex-lWinister and aPivy Coucillor; assist an huble' man like me and free me from my tyrant." "Go awa John Brown, go away," the right hon. gentleman woul&fd say; "you would become a tyrant and bully, and tyrannize. over the tyrant you have, if you were allowed the only. remedy against the grievance of which you complain. ("1 Hear," aDdlaughter.) JohnBrownnaturally said, " Good Heavens! 'What a positiontoplace me in. Iamnotanindependent man. You recollect, Sir, thetime when you stoodfor- igh Wycom'be and told us that we were sufferingunderunparalleled tyranny, and were subject to little knots ofi tyrants, and now when I bring the facts before you youssy, 'John Brown, I shall no longer assist you.'" The 3ight;f hon. gentleman, or any other gentleman, had a right to. change his opinion, but he could not change facts, ana. could not help being a witness as to the terrorisma whic& prevailed, and as to petty tyrants who existed, and whoun he desired toput down. Consequently, however much the, right hon. gentleman might choose to change his mnind, the' right hon. gentleman was a witness still on the sida of those who advocated the ballot, and he thought there wras no possibiliy of the right hon. gentlemay? showing how the non-electors became tyrants by the, simple fulfilment of that 'w;hich the lawv enjoined, NWowfiv, he found that during the last 5Middlesexr election v noble friend oF his indulged In what he considered an unconstitutional maxim. He found that Lord R. Grosvenorsaid that the electors ought to be responsible for the discharge of their duty. To whom, he asked, were the elector to be responsible bnt to God, their own consciences, and tce an intelligent deliberate publo opinion? ("Hear, hear,'m from Lord B,. Grosvenor.) He was glad to hear his noble' friend cheer him, and he perceived that hia noble friend had fallen into the delusion which the noble lord the memberfor London indulged in. ("Hear' and laughter.) So, then, the noble lord thought that an intelligent, deliberate publie. opinion could only exist under open voting. There he joined. issue with the noble lord. He maintained that it could not. exist under open voting, but orly under secret voting. An his noble friend had treated him with that good-nature& ironical cheer, let him ask his noble friend to consider whateffect public opinion had on the mind of a man undersecret voting, and what effect it had under open voting. With the ballot the elector could carefully wetth the opinions of public men, the merits of great public measures, and the arguments in the publio press, sad then, after getting the best information he could, and dellhe-atin&upon at, he went to the poll and gave a conscientious votein secret. Now, take the case of open voting. 'Under thatsystem of what use to the 500 dependents of Lord This or That was public opinion? The press might write by the yard, public men might talk by the hour; all that could> make no practical impression on their minds, for when they went to the poll our great national engine, the srew, wa_at work, and they could not vote but as their landlords commanded ! (Hear, hear.) Take the case of any set of menthe workmen at the mills, for instance. Of what use was public opinion to them? They were not called on to forna their opinions by public opinion, but by the wills of theimasters, and nothing could be easier than to give an illustration of this by referring to any great question of reform, Let them take the abolition of the corn laws, for instance. How long was that abolition postponed because the electors; dared not carry out public opinion at the polling-booths How lobg was public opinion set in for the abolition of the' corn laws before it was accorded? How long did public. opinion notoriously wagewaragaiat the cornlaws in vain7until at length something very like a great and powerfuiE conspiracy was called into existence to overcome the dursses put on the electors; andthat it was which was the cause of the' abolition of the corn laws. (Hear.) Two very eminent men, acknowledged to be authorities on the question of the co:n. laws, Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright, had often declaredthat if the electors had had the ballot they would have stood by public opinion, which was with the non-electors,aad thecoro, laws would have been abolished fully 30 years before theywere. (Hear, hear.) He had now attempted to answer soms. of the latest arguments against the ballot. The usaal modeof attack had been by guesses and surmises. When gentlemen had nothing practical to offer in defence of open voting they had recourse to guesses and surmises, observing tha; such and such things would happen if protective oting were adopted. But if the House turned to examplesit. would see that where the ballot exsted the best results ha& followed. Hon. members might take Hansard and looks through it from one end to the other and they would find. no instance in the speeches against the ballot of the failure of the ballot wherever it had been established. 2iL England the ballot was perfectly successfuL Whoever heard of the ballot failing in England? It; procured safety for those who voted under itr and preserved the peace, and a choice was made v'hich was correct and true. He found the same was thecase in all other countries. It 'was so ina olland. Therm the ballot acted peculiarly well ; and so it did in Belgium. It might be said, perhaps, that the priests in Belgium exercised an influence over the electors. That was an evil which could not be coped with. If a body of men submitted. their consciences to another body of men that could not be helped, but so long as men voted according to their wil that was all that could be attempted to be attainedIn Sardinia the ballot was regarded as the keystone of liberty. DIany hon. members-and probably among theun the noble member for the city of London (Lord J. .kussell) -might be acq uainted wbith Signor Valerio, one of thesenators of the n Chamber of Deputies, 'who had. expressed his opinion that " without the ballot the Iegisture (of Sardinia) would be returned by the aristocacy, she bishops, and the priests." (Hear, hear.) This country hat received a somewhat useful lesson 'ith regard to the conduct and equipment of an army in the field from little Sardima, and he thought that with respect tocivil vovemnent it; might also learn a lesson from the absence of intljnidatio. on the part of the priests and aristocracy at the Sardinian elections. He (Mfr. Berkeey) would ask the House to compare the absence of intimidation in Sardinia with the intimidation exercised by the priests andC the aristocracy in this country, ln America the ballot was perfectly successful in all States 'where duet attention had been paid to the secrecy of the voting. Jr_ all those States where intimidation or corruption had crept in it was found to be the result of a loose mode of baloting,_ but wherever the strict secrecy of the ballot had been main. tamed it had been attended with the best effects. He hadi on former occasions brought the case of America before the' House at such length that he would not now have safh anything more on the subject but for a paragraph in Tre Times which was very likely to be quoted, as anything which was supposed to tell against the ballot was eagerlsnaUtched at. That paragraph appeared under the Pompoma heading-" An Election Contrast." Now, a residence of many years in America, and a knowledge of the charactec of the people of that country, led him to doubt whethex this paragraph had been written by an Anerican. Thee paragraph commenced by aseuring its readers tbat the London Timtes was the proper authority witin regard to the English representative sstem, andI the writer then proceeded to drawv a comparison b_, t ween the mode of election in England and the mode t, election in America, declaring his preference for the Eng. lish system. He (Ur. Berkeley) certainly thoughtI wii regard to the case of America, that, considering the systeag of centralization which prevailed there, the secret com. mittees, the absence of the candidates, the wheels within wheels wlhich existed, and the genera complexity of the system, the ballot worked infinitely better in other ountriea than in the United States He might instance Sardinia and the Canadian and Australian colonies of Great Britain.; But when he found a writer in an American paper thug asserting the superiority of the English patriciansYstem oveC the American system of ballot, he would not believe thes authorwas an American, for he would evidently prefer T legitimate and annointed Xing to an elected Predent, an1 there wete not 10 men from Mlaine to Alabama who woulQ frank such an opinion.

LOYDOW, J7BD.NrESDAY, JULY 1, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord CLARENDON, in reply to Lord BnoUoUr, stated that the Governnent were in posseision of no inforrmation 'which would ir,duce them to beleve that an expedition had sailed frora Matrseilles with a view to imiport free negroes into French colonies. The Oxford University Bill, the object of which was to extend the commission for that 'University six months longer, was read a second timne, on the motion of Lord B ARRowBY, after a short discussion, in whiclh Lord DERBY and the Biahops of DunHAs, Lo.NDo.N, and St. AsAin's took part. Some other business was also despatched, and their Lordships adjourned. The House of Commons, at a morning sitting, was occupied in committee with the remaining clauses of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency (Ireland) Bill. In the evening, Mr. H. BERxExy renewed his sessional motion for leave to bring in a Bill to cause the votes of Parliamentary electors of Great Britain and Ireland to be taken by way of ballot. Lord PALAUsrTox, he observed, had told the House to -wait, for that he had a Reform Bill in prospect that vwas to swallow up all other Reform Bills; but he (Mr. BERKELEY) declined to wait without knowing what they were to wait for. Be, therefore, asked whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to adopt the ballot as a part of their Reform BiU next session. If the answer was in the affirmative, he had nothing to do but to sit down; but if in the negative he must rsubmit his case to the House. There being no audible response to this inquiry (although the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose from his seat), Mr. BsERKELr said he mu,t take silence to express dissent, and presume that it was not their intention to entertaiu the vote by ballot; he should, therefore, pursue the course he had taken on former occasions, and reply to the objections offered to the balot. He then reviewed the leading argments employed by the opponents of secret voting and by the advocates of open voting, contending that, had the former system been adopted, the abolition of the Corn Laws and other beneficial measures. would have been greatly accelerated; and he expatiated upon the advantages of that mode of voting in those countries where the ballot was in operatlon, drawing largely from authorities. IHe described what he termed the appalling features of the late election in England, referring to particular cases of intimidation or coercion exercised over voters-making a passing attack upon the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, and contrasted these scenes with the order and tranquillity which prevailed at Victoria, in Australia, since the ballot had been introduced, which was the more remarkable, he obser7ed, because, under open voting in that colony, the same features were exhibited as were apparent here. Mr. BEnRKELEY concluded by entreating the Government to give the people the ballot, which they would now receive as a boon, rather than wait until they should be compelled to surrender it to them as a right. The motion was seconded by Sir J. SHELr.BY, who mentioned cases in Westminster of pressure upon voters, and of non-exercise of the franchise, for want of the protection which the ballot would afford. The CHAwCELLoR of the ExcnxQ-nm was unable to adopt the views of Mr. BERKELY, or to form so sanguine an estimate of the beneficial effects of the ballot; but, on the contrary, he shared the alarm with which he believed the ballot was generally regarded by the opposite side of the House. He would consider this question, he said, in a practical view-whether the mode of voting proposed was adapted to the wants and circumstances of - this country. He adverted, first, to the ballot as practised on the continent of Europe, arguing that the different state of things existing there destroyed all analogy between the case of continental countries and England. He next examined the principles of this mode of voting in the United States of America, where the votes, it appeared, were not secret, but by tickets; and all we could understand from the American practice was that if a voter chose to conceal his vote he' might do so; but secrecy was not, as 31r. Berkeley seemed to assume, an essential part of the vote by ballot in America. Inl Massachusetts, where the ballot had been practleaJly open, a system of compulsory secrecy was introduced, and continued in-i force two years, when the old system was revertedtb, and there was now no State in the Union in whioh. the votes were conpulsorily secret. In considenni what wouldbetheeffectofaccedingtothizmotion, thc House must ask what was the system Mr. EBxs;RAi recommended .W's- the sao oy-e ho bonppo.a 6: compulsory ? The experience of the United States was against compulsory secrecy, and his (Sir G.- Lws's) conviction was thatthe atternptto introduce it into this country would be to row against an irresistible current, and that such an institution would be repugnant to the nature of the people. If a system of optional secreey wfas adopted, which some regarded as a panacea for all the evils of our, electoral system, it was his confident opinion that the great majority of the electors were ready and even desirous to avow their vote. In order to protect all voters, secrecy of voting must be made compulsory, which was not done in the United States. In his opinion we must look to moral iafluences, and not to laws, for an amendment of the practices complained of. Mr. G=im spoke vehemently ia support of the motion. Lord S. RusarBL observed that Mr. BEuE:BLEy rested his case upon three assumptlons, all of which he believed to be erroneous; first, that at this moment there prevailed so much intimidation that it was impossible that the opinions of those who were entrusted with the elective franchise could be fairly ascertained; second, that the voter had an indefeasible right to give his vote without reference to any one but himself, and without being brought before any tribunal to answer for his vote; and, third, that there is a very general and prevailing opmion throughout the country in favour of secret voting. Addmitting that there were cases of intimidation, he denied that, in general, tenants voting with their landlords voted against their will and their conscience. He protested against the doctrine that freeholders and 101.-voters were to be accounted infallible, and that in their hands was to be left a free and despotic power of voting as they pleased, without that responsibility, control, and criticism to which the highest functionaries in the State were subject. This was a doctrine contrary to the principles of the British constitution. He insisted that the country had a right to know how the franchise was exercised by those who were intrusted with it. As to the last assumption, although there were many persons who advocated the ballot, yet he did not believe that the general opiion of the country was in favour of secret voting. In America the ballot was not synonymous with secret voting. There would be no resource under the ballot but compulsory secrecy, no man being allowed to state what his vote was. Did anybody believe, he asked, that this would take place in England more than in America ? HIe was convinced that the evils of such a system would far overpower the good it might produce, and he would always raise his voice in favour of open voting. Mr. Bxnxr.EY rmade a short reply, and the House having divided, the motion was negatived by a majority of 68, the ayes being 189 and the noes 257. Mr. ARxwroN moved for a copy of the case subsnitted to the law officers of the Crown respecting the registration of nevwspapers and other printed papers, and their opinion thereon. The CaxwcLox of the ExcHEQuan said It was well known that it was not the habit of the House to require the production of any opinions given by the law officers of the Crown, which were confidentIal ; but he gave explanations respecting the case. The motion was negatived. Lord N, in moving for leave to bring, in a Bil to repeal the 27th section of the Superannuation Act of 1834, called the attention of the House to a case which involved the interests of a large body of Her Majesty's servants, and which demanded, he said, the immediate interposition of the House. He gave a short history of the Superannuation Acts and regulations, pointing out the inequalities of the system, and the hardships inflicted by it upon the civil service. He adverted to the two Bills introduced by the Government upon this subject last session, and to the report of the commissioners to whom the whole matter was referred, and upon whose recommendations (which he read) he rested his whole case. They recommended the abolition of the deduction, and he proposed to bring in a BiU to repeal the section in the Act of 1834 which authorized the imposition of the tax. The motion was seconded by Mr. H:NiEy. The Cs xr=or of the Excnxqmm said the subject was too important, the Interests involved were too large, and the sum of money it was proposed to vote away was too considerable to allow him to pass by the motion vithout pUtting the House in possession of the material facts of the case. Ee accordingly followTed Lord NAas in the jstatemeatqt he had made, and observred that the recommendations of the conunissioriers involved various matters besides the subject of deduction, aad which it would be incumbenb upon the Rouse, if i} tookup the question, riot to leave out of itB considdration, including the subject of pensions. TH3 adntitted that the system of supetannuation was fullof. omalies; still, it had been deliberately introdiice& by Xct of Parliament, which had been in. forc6 siace 1834, and all Nho had entered the service since Were cognizant of its existence, and that they-wete 'sutject.to the abatement. Under these circumstances lie could not accede to the notion-- . - r Sir F. BARuuG suggested that, with a- vievw, to Db, taining a fuller discussion of the subject than coiild be had at that late hour, the Bill iiW b4 irought The 0nANcELaon of the EiO qtmi, on th8t itnderstanding, abandoned his objectisns' biid lea-ve was givenito bring in the Bill, The remaining business having been disposed -of, the House adjourned at a quarter past 1 o'clock;.
We have several times observed.tbat.t neier yet was our fortunee to. miaeet, with a mmn whio wanted the Ballot for.1is -own private ase. ' Ve. have added that weg could' Aot even frame)in 'our min(ds the manner of man that could wish for sueh a thing. It is 'OvV49ys -A-boneboiler in Lambith who wants the .Ballot. for -a supposed farme3 in Shropshire, or a eoste&,.onger in Bethnal-green who wishes to protect a manznilliner. at Bath. Philanthropy in these daiys fakes'f very wide reach, and wNhen some hundred thousand a-yeav is spent in the eoiiversion 6f thf^Sctfi Sfea' slandera . it 'is but natural -that oiir Cocli6jis should wish to give to Scotchmen or Irislmen a political engine lwhich they do ngt appreeite jthemselves. However, there are signs of the challenge bemg taken up. Sir JoHx Smax .knows cases in Westminster where, for want .of theBallot, free-- born Englishmen were obliged to:abstain from the poll. We should like to see the men. We should like to know their ways, whether they are naualaly so reserved, and whether they are always as dark as the Ballot-box. But think .of. Westminter- as a case for the Ballot ! The city returned at the last election, without a contest, Etwo mien whose principal recommendation is 'that they are independent of party and speak their minds on all subjects, without caring whom ,they offend. The city which returns these men ivithout a contest contains the Legislature, the Pablie Offices, the Court, and the principal 'part of. the aristo- cracy of England. These four distinct and | tremendous influences, potential as they are, in their own spheres, are absolutely powerless in the constituency of Westminster. It woula be possible to name a dozen publichouses which have far more power than all -these put togeLther within this locality. It-eannot be said that either Sir DE acy h Evxs or Sir JoRm Sr:a:x . is exactly a man after the heart of any one of these great powers, or that he represezits anybody, unless it.be the Westminster elector. 'This being, then, -has his own ideal, ahd chooses his man zGccrding to that ideal, setting utterly at nought, without a moment's consideration, and without being even aware of it, the greatest political personates, influences, aid powers in the 'whole world, whol4 he happens to have in his own borough. Yet this Weshtinster elector,-this- man who used to elect Fox, and BuRDurx, and HopBnousu, and anybody who co6se to set up against, the Tories 'or the Court,-.-,this man who does not careo a fig foi Qunra, Iords, and Conenons, Secretaries of State, and Ministers -of allkhnds, :EIorse Guards, Admultj; or a hund.red departments,-this man who rzeh~ii%SbD I EvAsis and Sir Jonw SnEIan+.g ir DE LAcy hesitation, is the case discovered at last for the protection 6f th6 Ballot. In thg name of truth and comn.on sense,'protection frorA'.'whom?, No doubt, there are plenty of people who- :1f I say anything to get, rid of an ilmnuot 6c4].vasser. There are others wfho have really no opinions about polifkaes, and who 'gladly ayail them4- selves of any exeuse to .escape the necessity of' having an opinion. So tlhey allege external pressure. As they have no opinion, it is quite as 'well they should not vote, when their vote would be a random one. But these are not the men vho .ask for the Ballot. They wish to hide themselves in their parlours and back shops from the persecutions of the candidato who wants to ferret them out. 'That keen and i4defatigable animal, 'being thus baffled of his prey,' wants the Ballot simply to sharpen his own teeth and cla'ws. He wants to be able to say, " Coine, "now, you!ve the Ballot. You may vote as you "like without caring for you'r landlord of your " customers." There are many such men even where there is the Ballot. In France, for example, a large proportion abstain from voting; and uLnless a man's opinions are very decided there iz no reason why he should nob abstain. Indeed, in common consistency, should -we ever have the Ballot, there ought tQ be provision made for those rwho cannot make up their minds.; -who may happen to think both candidates equally bad, or equally good, or equally indifferent; and who may not wish to offend either, or both, by abstaining from the poll. Neutrality is a species of choice, and ought to be protected as much as decision. When a child is asked whether it would rather be nibbled to death by ducks or sucked to death by oysters, it usually answels "Neither " and the -cattal choice offered to a British elector is often no better, and therefore deserving of the same reply. Why, then, shoulld a man be compelled to tell two candidates that he thinks them equally disagreeable, though the one twaddles and the other rasps ? No. In consistency, the neutral man ought to be. protected; and,.if he is, then we doubt whether the Ballot will make any difference with the poor bewildered yeomen or shopkeepers, who talk about stewards, Lady Tuis, and Sir Jon7x TnAT. They don't want to vote at all; 'or, if they .siy they 'vllfo -Y.tly crA wasun+tA, +11oW really vote as they wish, going naturally along with their landlords or their chief customers, and holding their interests to be identicaL We do not, however, seriously wish to protect neutrality any more than decision. It -is the ancient custom and law of this country, and certainiy in accordance with the national character and habits, that every political act should be public. Whether a man vote, at all, and, if he votes, whom he votes for, are public matters,-qulte as public as the Parliamentary conduct of the 'representative chosen, and as the political results of the whole system. Ninety-nine hundredths of. that system are necessarily public, and the whole of the respectable portion of it is, and ever must be. Every man of property, every lawyer, or doctor, or clergyman, every man of standing, of education, or of intellect, has public opinions and personal associations, which leave little doubt as to his vote on any possible occasion. Even vwhere there might be such a doubt, he is nevertheless expected to be ready to say whom he votes for, and he is thought a sneak or a fool if he does not say it at once. In politics, however, being one of the staples of British conversation; and being discussed every day whenever two men meet in the sateets, it is impossible. to escape an opinion. For.whom, then, is secrecy demandedc? We have anawereL over and over again, that nobody demands it. Nobody wants the Ballot for himself. People profess to want it for othera in Xthe spirit either of ignorant compassion or gratuitous insult. It's an easy. way .of telling those, who, don't 'vote for you that they . are cowards. But what is the fact? Are there many people, or any people, who talk one way and vote another) ox who, after talking loudly on. one side, don't vote at al I tt is just possible there may be a case rete and there. When we have seen it we shall -bolieve it. _]ut.We4protest,againat honest, open. hearted, plainxzpeaking England being entirely renmodelled to suit the convenience-of--sic-.ne-oirL one county and two in anlother, who by somo extraordinary circumstance may find it: inconve. nient to give an open vote. The constitution of a country ought to be accommodated to 'tIJ' tasite, the habits,' and the convenience of the ninety-nine good 3nen and' true, not the one pboi creature whose circumstances or character mak-e himn: exception to the general rule. '.Tne'Bouse of Cooim'ond has decided .once more againat the' proposed subversiofi of" the hncient Constitution of the country, and by-- a large inajority.

If he pay but. 101. a-year for his house, lhe is. politically equal to the millionaire or. the lord of a whole coiinty. But nobody-at least, wVe should like to see the man-expects to enjoy this.e4uality of right without the conditio,n.of. equal, publicity.

It is certainly pleasant to have only to -pffer congratulations quarterly on the subject of the Revenue. . In spite of war ,against a first-rate European Power-in spite of a. Peraian, campAign, a Chinese Expedition, and an Indian Mutiny, the resources of the country are growing as fast.as if it were a new State to the w, est of the Missppi settled ten years ago by a band of pioneers. The monthly return of Exports might prepare one]for the elasticity of the Revenue; the. s_ddenaoadvAnci which the trade of the country made .after: tfie preseure of actual warfare passed. awray -has beeni sustained, and the value of articles of al7 Lds. sent abroad during 1857 will undoubteWl be far. greater than in any previous year. qf 3B;itishp liltory. Thus, though the Rovenv e retitump toir the piesent Quarter-aihow an actual difcien6yj*e4ay point to therA . a a proof !;f`i-h the j1s,p'eritwic .the nation has now learnt toIok ipCozit as.a nmtter of ecourse. Large ridiactons of 0 a,,11on m t' bring -with them a tempoxary d,efloieip. and: the ' transition from :the financial.. readiness of waz -to the ho,peful boldness and the re nission o'f. a state of peace must o6ca*niiaby cause iw £ubcOi of.incom&, for' a certain mited t drn .to Xall short ox. the calculate .xppxiiieii . . ,ui iD. .J these shortcomings ale obliterated in the steady increase of the national wealth., Take, not, a qua;ter, but a term sufficiently long to allow the policy of .any plan of finance to have fair play, and the courage. wv,ich trusts to the. elasticity of Athe national. re-, sources is fully justfied. Thus, though there be a deficiency . on' the Quarter,ending yesterday of about 350,0001., there has been no return i for ML long time so encouraging and so* indicative df a sound financial policy. At the beginning of the Quarter the reduced rates on tea and sugar took effect, and t'he proportionate decrease in the amount of Customns should have beenno less than 300,0001. But, ouiing-to the increased consumptionx of a number of articles, and principally of those on which the, due. has been remitted, there is, instead of a deficiency, an increase on the Quarter of 280,0001. The increase is mkade upon tea, sugar, coffee, and tobacco; there is a loss of about 60,0007 on rum and brandy. Thi increase -on the Year is 472,000., and the fact that so laWge a part of tllis is due to the last Quarter shows that the improvement in the aondition of the country has met with no interruption. But it is fair to say that this favourable state of things is to some extent the-result of the deliveries of tea, sugar, and coffee having been- delayed in I order to take advantage of the reduced scale Qf duties. In the Excise the decrease on the Quarter is 501,000?., of which 244,0001. is accounted for by a portion of the Hop Duty being postponed uutil the next Quarter. The reduction of the Malt-tax is the cause of the remaining deficiene.y. When the extra tax imposed during the war was remitted it was expected that the result would be a decrease of 2,000,0001. on the Year, and 700,000l. on the present Quarter. But the increase of consumption has replaced more than twothirds of this anticipated deficiency. The loss on the Quarter is only 200,0001., or, in other words, the duty for three months is half. a million sterling .more than was countea upvu-a -sl^ nug pi.,t uz the well-being of the people, and we think, in spite of the total abstainers, a gratifying result. Notwithstanding reductions, the Excise for the Year shows an increase of 111,2221., the amounts being, for the year ending June 30, 1856, 17,652,7781., and for the year ending yesterday 17,664,0001. These figures indicate the great consuming power of our population, and the sums they are content to spend on material indulgences. Thus the increased duty on SpiAits consumed in the three lingdoms is no less than 600,000l.,an, amount which represents a vast sum spent on native alcohoL The Excise would, indeed, have been much greater had it not beein for the repeal of the Malt-tax and the missing Hop Duty. In Stamps the decrease on the, Quarter is 7,0001., and the increase on the Year 302,0001.; the amount brought to the Revenue during the year ending yesterday being? ,364,617t The Taxes offer nothing worthy of notice, and we next come to the Property and Income-tXx, the mnainstay of modern Chancellors of the Exchequer, and the beat test of the resources of the country. The amount for the Quarter ending June 30, 1857, was 2,455,5401,, to 2,S76,7511. in the corresponding Quarter: of test years makdng an increase of 78,7891. IFor the lat year the amount is 16,168,7231. to 15,187,9531. in the preceding year, or an increase of not far from a. million sterling, Such an advance. in ,the space of a single twelvemonth would, however, be more thai even the buoyant resources of the country could 6fect. It is due .~~~onr R s u to the illcreased duty of 2d. wMioh belonged to ths QUarter to September 30, 1850, &,nd which raised the Revenue of that Quarter above the corr3Pipnding Quarter in 1855. We have nowr pcome to the end of the War Winepence, and must expect to find this gigantic sur of 16,000,0t7o1. dwindle to a comparatively small amount for th,' -next- financial year. --A dooubtthatUin-the0 case of other imposts, A dimiunution in thb rate is not: followed by a proportionate deficlency; q we may expect that, with the .: great .de'VelopMent of population,. conmerce, aad 'realth? the., 7d. which produced 5,000,0001. in 1841 wi produce 6,000,OOOl., or more,: in 1858' FBut .the great tax which enabled me to Sight the Ibussiana is now to pass aWay, and we Xusf adapt .expenditure to the new condition of things;. ]EEqw'ever, it will not soon be forgotten, .by ChAucellors of the Exchequer that at a mnoat momentops crisis, .whei. a audden call was made on the 'resources, of. theAState, every penny in the pound Whicli was imposed ou. incomes .produced .- 3illion: Sterling, It is, no doubt, a thing to. be, proua of and tol Ibe. remembered for use in the time of need. - * The net decrease.. on. the Qt4rters arsinig froip., the -caiIse we have mentioned, is 273 2411 Zc netincrease on theYear is no lestha;Il82TJO94;, received 'without the -addition of any ,ebh tp;, and in spite of large remisions e lnrmg ' last:QuWarter.

As we peruse the numerous private communications arziving from India we are enabled to forni a more distinct idea of the progress and incidents of this deplorable Mutiny. Never, nwe believe, were acts of insurrectionary violence based on more unsubatantial grounds, or conwitted with more indefinite vie*s. _The Sepoys have been precipitated.into rebellion by panic, and have actually risen against authority fromi sheer fright and causeless alarm; The accounts of the successive' outbreaks present the features' of a moral epidemic, -under the infliuence of *hich men suddenly turned upon Wheir officers in a deliriuini of dread, the first example of general bloodshed having been set by the troops at Meerut. . At Barrackpote and Berhamporc, the discontent of the. Sepoys had assumed the form. of sullen disaffection; at other places, where previous -to the 10th of May the- spirit of rebellion had shown itself, the disorderv was cheeked without violence; but at Meerut the mutinous impulse took the direction of murder, and the conflagration, the tmult, and the carnage had the inevitable effect of redoubling the agitation prevailing. So much of what is related, in eorrespondence rom the spot must have beeni drawn fron imnperfect infoination that care becomes requisite in thbe Ami%,mination and comparisoT f reports; but we observe enough to conk= our conviction that no general cdncert could have existed between, the r6iolting battalios, and.ithat no eommon object, or, indeed, any: object at all, wa kept before thear eyes. Every case of delinquenbcy had modiffic&ons. of, its owin. Eaeh. of the mutionis regunents'ad its owin particular frenzy, and took the disorder, with symptoms peculiar to itself. In many-casesthe infection was but partial. Even in the Sd .I.Lt (ivaly-a' corps which appeard. to ve conceived extraordinary alarm at the inapti4oniMtofsome of. its.trospers-=some 70 or 80 men remained faithful, and,whatis especiallyreimarkablW, these very men were led against another corpq in .mutiny siX days afterwards, and behaved with.un'flincing loyalty and courage. In the 11th Redimeait though the officersof this battalion were the first victims of the massacre, it appears certain that the work of murder was conmitted by the men of the 20th, and parties of the corps itself were oaid to be deserting the :revolters and returning to their alleo2ance. At Delhi the soldiers of the 38th refrined ~rorn attaikingtheir own officers, though they fired upon t aose of other regiments, andc the 74th, also part of the Delhi garrison, is. reported as in reality entertaining no cordial sympathies vith the rebellion. Of the Native Artillery it is expressly said that the gunners were dragged into th'a Mi tinyby force alone. From all sides we are assured that the general population has exhibited rather good wil than hostility towards us, and in many cases effectual protection has been afforded to the fugitives from Delhi. In that city alone and at Meerut does any evidence of popular malignity as yet appear, but at both these places the native rabble rose, vwe are told, by thousands, and contributed in no small degree to the horrors of the scene. It may be expected, indeed, that manyof the atrocities reported -vill be found traceable, as our information improves, not to the Sepoys themselves, but to the mobs, -vhich availed themselves of the license attendant on the Mutiny. The Rajahs, or native Princes of the country, have shown a signal attachment to the British Government, and have supported us promptly with their followers, while the great landowners, themselves equivalent to territorial lords, have, without exception, been firm in their allegiance. IL no one of the reports now reaching us in such abundance do we perceive any statement or expectation that any local lord will carry his retinue or his countenance to the misguided puppet proclaimed at Delhi. The discontent and the disturbances together appear strictly confined to the -1 Ot4Ai vO t1t, 3>-,11 &y_! Notwithstanding the religious origin still attributedc to the disaffection, it is a purely Mlfitary revolt, and amounts, in fact, to little more than an intend-s fled expression of the same senseless spirit of mutiny which has been discernible for some time. 1 It becomes evident, as our knowledge of details increases,that the mutineers did not suoceed without i considerable difficulty, even where there was the' least power of resisting them, as at DeEl It appears that Ieutenant Winotroury defendea the greatI magazine to the Iast, and that when compelled to evacuate his post he set fire to-the powder and blew| hundreds of the insurgents into the air. That. he escaped with his life from this fearfl hazard| seems certain, but whether he eluded the other perils of the crisis, and survives to enjoy the credit of his splendid gallantry and devotion, we are not yet informed. At- M£eerut the examples of individual heroism were numerous. DLeutenant Mnsr, of the 20th NSative Infantry, galloped into the midst -of the mutineers, satisfied hhnself of the nature of their proceedings,-and, by the aid of a revolver, fought his way back. A little later the same officer actually drove in his buggy into the heart of the city, seized a man notoriously, concerned in the masacre, and cariTed him off to a gibbet, from wvhich he was presently suspended. - We have described this revolt as a senseless and causeless insurrection, and that it really deserves no other character must be admitted by all. Every person in this country, and indeed throughouit Burope, who has the least knowledge ofth subject, must be perfectly convinced that the apprahension of forced conversion, on whichl the Sepoys have based their mutiny, had no foundation w.hatever. We have never entertained or professed the smallest design of extirpating Brahmiisirm or abolishing caste, and our general policy has been open rather to the opposite imputation of la-ity or indulgence. It is only in rare instanes-and after qg he sation that the authority of the Governme^ut has been lent to the auppression of cuatomns froniXbich the Eindooi themseve5m were t-nikful to b'e 8;lieved.

Tam BRrrIS CO?ssnwAT A NEw Yoito-The interest which the merchants of New York naturally fee in the questonI "Who is to succeed llt. Barclayi" the consulate for this city induces us to notice a rmour that a Mr. Iousada, holding some sabordinate consular position il Cuba, is to be advanced to the vacant post in this city. Without knowing the history of the rumour we shal venture to disbelieve it upon the simple ground that the British Consuate in New Yorkl is of far too great importance to English interests, and too intimately connected with the commercial intercourse of the two nations, to be intrustel to one who, whatever abilitieshe may have elsewhere shown, is a stranger to our people, lnversed in their habits, their custorms, their temper, and their laws, Tine was when the Consular offices in the gift of the Government, liko the Colonil Governorships.in days of old, were lavshed upon personal favourltes, or bestoweed as rewards for party ssrvices, with little regard to thefitnessof thenran for the work allotted him ;and, if the statementof aLondon let -wtriter be correct of thO host ofapplicantsforMr. Barclay's place, the opnonvould appear tobeprev,alentthat t'he.ancientplractica is not exict. t even if this be true to some extent in England, and the world over, there is a markda difference between petty consulates in less frequented Sb*tes and the Consulate at New York that neither the British Government nor the British people, intent on the protectiOn of Brtish Interests and t e encouragement of international harmony and eo-operation with the growing empire of the west, are at all likely to overlook. In regard to the individual nominees for this post, the expression of personal preferences by any body of Ameriean merchants-excepting, perhaps, the British residents-might well be zegarded by the Foreign-office as an unauthorized intdrference, if not an 17mpertinent dictatien; but we do not for a monhent suppos3 that the British kovernment are insendble to the hope and belef naturally entertained on this side of the water hat in their deliberate selection of a gentleman to act as their Consul In New York their choice will fall on some one who is already known a respected by our community, who is alreadyfa ar with the duties and respousib7lties of the. office, xad whe will command, from the strt, the regad and eonadence of the people in whose midst thoRe duties and responslbilitkes are to be hozne.-ifew York; 7IEbunc.

SECOND EDITION. THB TXMES-OFFIOE, Wednesday Monming. EXPRESS FROM PARIS.: The following is the letter of our Paris corroepondent, dated yesterday (Tuesday), 6 p.m..- The second elections for the Paris districts whera the candidates had not obtained the absolute majo rity will take place on Sunday next, the 5th of July. It is very probable that General Cavaignac will again present himself to the electors, though his de termination is not, I believe, as yet irrevocably fixed. Ile has hesitated a good deal, and so have his friends. They think that the experiment that has already been made is sufficient for present purposes, and tbat it would not be prudent to risk a second trial where every means will be employed against him,| and where failure would be a far greater check than in the provinces. Of his success we can say nohing. In oficial regions his defeat is spoken of as certain; whether it is really thought so is another question, but some of his supporters speak of it with doubt. It is all but certain that neither he nor his colleagues will take the oaths to the Emperor; they will content themselves with this evidence of their existence as a party, and they may not go farther even in the way of manifestation. M. Goudchaux was from the beginning indisposed to come forward, and he yielded with some difficulty to the entreaties of his friends. However lightly the Government may affect to spealk of the success of the Opposition candidates in the capital, it is positive that it views it with much dissatisfaction. The Emperor, who had constantly been told thab the working classes were for him to a man, is disappointed with those on whose attachment he counted, and irritated with those whose timidity or whose sycophancy led him into error. It Is not, then, true that the vote of the adverse distriets is a matter of such complete indifference as the Ministerial organs wonld lead us to suppose. Previous to the elections those organs directed all their eloquence against the Opposition, and urged in strong language the importance of rejecting them; and from the importance which they attached to the results it was clear that the success of General Cavaignac and his fellow-candidates was looked upon as a check of a very serious character indeed. Their fears probably exaggerated that event, but the attempt now made to diminish it deceives no one. On the other hand, the Republicans, at least the moderate portion of them, feel much elated at the success, however partial, they have obtained in Paris and elsewhere, and, if we are to beliove them, that success has surpassed their expectations. It will no longer be maintained, they say, that their party has ceased to exist, that it has passed from the memory of man, that it has yielded to despair, or that, from a consciousness of utter helplessness, it has rallied to the new r4gime. It is true that in Paris, which public opinion or prejudice if you will, has long regarded as the centre of political life in France, the Government has obtained 110,000 votes; bat it is equally true that in the same city, under the eye of the Government, and within the grasp of its agency, the Republicans, disheartened and disorga. nized as they were thought, have found from 96,000 to 98,000 voices in their favour. The men who have come forward to dispute the victorywith the Government are several of them known to Europe; they have rendered good service in their day, and they are convinced that in case of any great emergency it is to them that even the bourgeoisie of Paria would look as their safeguard against the excesses of Socialism. It is well, they say, that there names should come now and then before the public. Such is the reasoning of the party; they form perhaps an exaggerated estimate of the feeling in their favour, but it is certain that such is the estimate. On the question of the Republican candidates taking their seats in the Legislative Corps, I believe that were they more numerous, 15 or 20 for instance, they would arrange the matter with their conscience, and submit to the preliminary order of the oath. They are, however, as yet too few to make it worth their while to do so; they will probably content themselves with what they have done, and wait for another and a better occasion. It is now a question with many whether, under such circumstances, the Emperor will modify bis policy, or give additional force to bis authority. Will he take the initiative in the introduction of a more liberal system; or will he impose stP'l farther restrictions on the little liberty that exists ? Will he narrow the basis on which his fame rests, by pruning down " universal suffrage," and render his government less popular-that is, less absolute, by courting the support and sympathy of the intelli gent and educated classes, rather than of the .masses ? These are questions frequently asked since the eleetions. Time can only answer them. The following t3legraphic despatch has been received from Kabylia:- "BIVOUAC D'AIT-LARBA, AMONG TaE BENI-YENNI, JuNs 25. "At 4 o'clock this niorning the divisions of Generals Renault and Yusaf began to ascend the mountains; at 7 they arrived at the top. The enemy did not make the3 resistance we expected in such a countly. " The two villages of Ait-Larba and Sidi-Laseen, the largest in all Kabylia, were vigo.-ocsly carried. " We are now masters of the entire country." It was reported that General MMahon was killed in the last action in Kabylia. It now appears that several musket-balls passed through his greatcoat without injuring him. General Bourbaki had a horse shot under him. There are eight officers Jtors de combat, and trom 5uo tu o00 ouan- The -Pays, Ministerial paper, publishes a private letter from Erzeroum of the 5th inst., which announces that the Commissioners appointed to rectify the Russian and Turkish boundaries in Asia arrived at Gumrl on the 1lth inst., and commenced operations on the day following. The Commissioners are Colonel Simmons, for England; M. Pelissier, fRt France, accompanied by M. Saillard, Secretary to the Commissioners; and General Tehirikoff for Russia. Lord Cowley is on a visit with Count Walewski, at the Chateau de rEtoile, near Pai;s, formerly the residence of Madame de Pompadour. A letter from Pisa, of the 23d inst., states that the festival of the Luminaria, which took place the preceding week, gave occasion for a new display of that apprehension and terror by which the Tuscan Government suffers itself to be intimidatcd. Since the day the muskets were seized at Cascina the police had circulated a report that an insurrection would take place on the evening of the Luminaria. For this reason poniards, imprisonment, insurrection, and a general catastrophe were admitted as events, if not certain, at least probable. On the evening of the Luminaria the police gave orders not to suffer closed carriages to pass. Whenever a police agent met with one of those carriages he commanded the coachman to return home. This measure was adopted seriously fearing that suspected persons or infernal machines might be concealed in closed carriages. The consequence was that the really magnificent fite of the Luminaria had but few followers. In the memory of the oldest inhabitant there never were so few visitors. Three years since 10,000 persons came toPisa fromLeghorn alone to assist at the ftte. This year there were not half the number. The same observation applies to the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, who were accustomed to come to Pisa in crowds. This year nobody stirredfroml home. The police converted Pisa this year into a barrack or rather into a retrenched camp. The guard-houses were multiplied, and no demonstration which could strike terror into the minds of the inhabitants was spared. The day, consequently, was passed at Pisa in gloom and silence, and the credulous were the dupes of their credulity. The irnpression produced on the public was that the terror displayed by the police indicated their weakness, and the useless display of force was regarded as an impotent and ridiculous manifestation. Respect for the Government, which Is the true principle of authority, gained nothing, and in Tuscany particularly the greatest misfortune which could happen to the Government would be to fall into contempt.

The Chamber of Deputies renewed the debate tcday on the project for tunnelling the Mont Cenis, and, the right of spealdng being accorded to Count Cavour, in compliance with his reque3t at the end of yesterday's sitting, he commenced by saying,- " I will avoid all extraneous subjects. The Govecsr'ent desires that the conditions on which the work should be ceded to the Victor Emmanuel Company should at once be determined. The Deputy Moia wishes that the Government should assnme the undertaking of tannelling, leaving the conditions of cession to be determined hereafter. The Deputy Moia, in his vigorous and biting reply, no longer attacks the fusion by which the danger of a large indemnity for the Savoy Railway ought to be diminished. When the Novara Railway shall be joined with It and the tunnel made, the product of these lines will far exceed4A percent.: but the Deputy ?oisplaceshimself in contradiction to his own doctrine of opposing too many Government employgs, and, moved by the desire of fnding the Ministry in fault, he would now advocate the purchass of the Novara Railway. The spirit of opposition pushed to excess hasproduced this consequence. The contract for the fusion is good for the Government, because it wil give more than the guaranteei43 percent., but capitabst dont think their mpney well invested in raihrays if it does not return 7 or 8 per cent. The- price- of Novara shares remains high, in the hope of the fusion being approved ; but, take the Cuneo Railway, which gives 7 per cent., and the shares of 500£ are at 580!. The Deputy Della Motta is not favourable to the system of guaranteed interests. On general grounds I quite agree with him. We consented to a guarantee for the Victor Em. manuel Company, because it was the only way of getting the Savoy Railway made, and I like the Savoy Railway more than I dislike the guarantee. But now we wish tv diminish the risk incurred thereby for the Treasury, a-m the Deputy Della Motta, in consistency to his prlnciples, should support theo pojoot ho Dcpaty Anroni does not like foreign companies: but I don't think this argument can have great weight with you. I w.lU meat it by quoting your own vote for the Railway from Anneoy to Geneva, given to a foreign company, and that still larger work, the Coast Railway, which is also to b3 given to a foreign company. Our market is not sufficient to supply 100 or 120 millions. I need not, therefore, detain you futther on this argument. An uninterrupted line from the Rhone to the Ticino will assure a better service than if divided under different managements, and the Company will be in a po 1- tion to make great saorfices to attract the-commerce of Lombardy, France, and Switzerland. By the junction of the Susa with the Novara Company the State was exonerated from an expense of 200,000f, It is not necessary to allude to this. We have no choice of persons -with whom to make a contract. We have undertaken a moral obligation towards the Victor Emmanuel Company. Suppose, moreover, the tunnel made, who would buy it of you ? The Susa Railway is transferred to the Victor Emmanuel Company. Who, then, would assume the working of 53 kilometres under such difficult circumstances? You would not be able to sel it, perhaps, for 100,000f. a kilometre even. The Deputy Moil will say that is a consequence of the imprudence of selling the shares of the Sus Railway. (lifoia"I did not approve that.") The Deputy Moia had this argument, inipeUo :-I was not wrong: but I take credit to myself for havLng contributed to that cession, because it assists the new convention; because, if that fusion had not been made, the Susa Railway certainly would not have been in a condition to make an offer for the Mont Cenis. If there is only one contracting party we should not put it in a bad position. We say to it,-Either accept these conditions or we will not make the tunneL And this argument has great weight. Bat if you decide on making the tunnel yourselves the Victor Emmanuel Company will be less and less disposed to make sacrifices the further we go. iThis is evident. The Victor Emmanuel would say, 'Work your railway and we shaU have the benefit of it.' Moreover, when four kilometres are made, so many interests are then mixed up in it, economical political, and financial, that no Parliament would refuse the funds even when there might be no contractors to be found. But the Deputy Moia tells us that the company gives us 20 bad millions because we: are reduced to a point that the millions are as nothing. (bloia.-" If it gave them, well and good but it does not give them.") It is only a loan at 4Q per cent. the Deputy Moia says, which may be had elsewhere at 5- But the special guarantee on the 20,0C0,0C0 is to cease when the average product of the whole line oxceeds 6 per cent., as it no doubt will when once the :EtU.& U.X:711 L. _,.o, %",fi.l AfT. ;1--I -1- ledges that the prodtuct of the line will probably be increased 12,OCOf. by the tunnel. In fact, there is no tourist who vill not come to see this work. Every year 200,000 travellers come to Switzerland, and If human CUriosity does not cease the greatest part will come on to see the tunnel. As to the new methods of Jouffroy, Delorenzi, &o., If you should have a doubt of the effica^y of the system of compressed air you should not undertake even four kilometres. The four kilometres will be very costly; it will be necessary to establish machinery and engines for making experiments, so ithat the four first kUometres will be the most ex. pensive. The experiments alone will cost 6,000,000 or 7,000,000. If you have not confidence then you should charge the Government to make fresh studies. The Deputy Mois wishes to commence work without further experiments. He has given me a patent for imbecility, and I cau ay that to a certain po!ut I cannot imagine a system more absurd than h;s, and the Govern- ment refuses it. There is no choice left between the arceptation and the rejection. Theundertaling is certainly immense; there is no concealing the magnitude of our responsibility in asking such a voth of confidence; but wa have hopes of overcoming this immense diffaculty. The difficulty, howeveK, is only to h3 overcome on the condition of those who conduct the enterprise havlng a lively faith in the result. If we did notfeel this faith we should not insist on assuming the responsibility. You will ask, perhaps, whence comes this faith, which if it eannot remove mountains, can pierce through them. It rests on the means we have proposed. In the Ministry there isa practical man of somo worth, and the others are net altogether so ignorant of all sCoentifie knowledge as not to be able to appreciate the reasonableness of those means. It is based on the judgment of a commission composed of most able professors and engineers. Finally, I have confidence in the engineers who propose it, because of their knowa capaeity, honesty, and modesty, and their always having done mnore than they promised. I feel confident that at at the olose of the Ees- sion you will not gainsay that frank and ardent polioy that you have hitherto followed, If you should adopt the Moia proposition I shall regret It, not so much for the fact Itself as because it will be a sign that the future polioy of Parliament is altored. I hope, then, you will associate your names with the greatest work of modern times-the tunnel of the Mont Cenis." On the proposition of Signor Moia being put to the vote it was rejected by an Immense majority, having only about 22 or 23 supporters altogether. The Chamber afterwards proceeded to examine the details of expenditure, in which some changes had been suggested by the Commission, and, for th 3 most part, accepted by the Ministty. There wal no definite result, however, from the remainder of this discussion, and the House adjourned till Bonday. In the Senate the Bill for transferring the Naval Arsenal to Spezzia was brought forward for discus sion. Senator Franzini was the first to oppose the measure, which he did on the ground of inopportunity He thought that the political condition of Europe would not admit of Sardinia altering her naval station, and placing it elsewhere, with such stability a; was desirable. He also advanced financial objections. Senator Gonet, on the contrary, recognizing all ths difficulties, thought the measure well advised and apropos. The arguments on this point, he said, had already proved the necessity of the move both fo. the military and mercantile marine. The third orator (if one may use so strong an expression) was the Marquis Brignole Sale, who read a long paper, embodying a2l the arguments ever brought against the project since it was first agitated, with the addition of some local considerations which natural'y occurred to himn as a leading member of the Genoese oligarchy. To this lengthy document, which wa3 so long that the honourable member himself appeared almost as weary as his audience, the Ml nister of War, Ge -eral La Marmora, briefly replied. There was noth new In the arguments of the gallant General er, for the simple reason, probably, that everyt .g possible has already been said on the subject. He spoke of the admirable appro priateness of the Gulf of Spezzia for a military navy, the absolute necessity for removing it from Genoa, and the facility of defending Spezzia. The HIouse adjourned the further discussion t) Tuesday next. A telegraphic despatch, dated from Rome, the 28th, in the Ulnivers, states that Cardinal Antonelli on the previous evening received M. Montes, th3 Mexican Minister, but not in his diplomatic capacity. His title as Mexican Envoy is not, it declares, to ba recognized until his Government shall have annullel the measures it has adopted against the Church. A letter from Rome, of the 25th ult., in the Con1siitutionnel, says:- " There appears to be no doubt that the excursion of the Popeowill extend beyond the limit of his own States. I have it from the best authority that HIis Holiness will certainly vlsit Florence, where the Pitti Palase will be placei at his disposal by the Grand Dake. I can also mention a; an almost certain fact that the Pope viP. go to Moden, and to Parma, and, if certain rumours may be credited, h may even extend his journey to Milan and to Venice, ba: this last-named intelligence I regard as less positive. Th , harvest has commenced pretty generally in this neighboarhood, and never was there a more abundant crop. Th s prospect of cheap food already begins to gladden the heart of the people, who have of late su Tered so severely fro n the dearness of bread, whioh forms the principal part o' their food. The worlrs of the railway between Roome anil Civita Vecchia are being carried on with great aotivity even the extreme heat of the weather has not in any way impsded their progress." The Bilancic, of M{ilan, publishes the following allocution adlJressed by the Pope to the Austrian officers at Bologna:- " Gentle'nen,-It is a great joy for me to find myself in the mid-,, of the most distingu3shed officers of a portion of the Austrian army-of the army of the noblest and most arident of empires, of an army so well disciplined, s) honoured, and so distinguished for its fidelity to its Sovereign and to the Sovereign Pontiff ! I owe much gratitude to th s r,-, uz -- qu.Uy, I owe much or tha', gratitude to the Austrian army. I invoke the heavenly blessing of God on tho sacred person of yonrSovereign and on yourselves. May It, at the end of your carcer of honour, glory, and Chrlstian virtmes, enable you to obtaln from Heaven the reward of your deseias." ' SPAIN. (FROM OUR OW±f Con'axo!qDNT.) MADRID, JuNz 26. The counter-memorandum addressed by Senor Pidal to Senor Lafragua has made no change In the position of the Mexican question. The Spanlsh Government abates nothing of its previous demands, and especially Insists on the indemnity to be granted to the Spaniards who suffered from the recent outrages. According to present appearances, therefore, the affair has come to a dead-lock. Senor Lafragua, however, has postponed his departure until next week, and this looks as if there were still some hope in reserve. I understand he intends replying to Senor Pidal's memorandum. Although he perhaps, in the present state of public feeling, dares not give way, Senor Pidal is known to be unwiling to go to war with Mexico, and he is even reported to have said that, sooner than agr,e to commence hostilities, he would quit the Cabinet. Such a resolution would be a proof of good sense, for it is impossible accurately to estimate all the evils that might ensue to Spain from an il-advised aggression upon Mexico. Yesterday, in the Congress, the report of the committee of the law concerning the press, proposing the approbation of the project Of authorization to promulgate which the Government had brought in, was read and ordered to be printed. A number of Deputies rose to demand to speak against it, and numerous amendments have been announced. In consequence of this, it is said that several Deputies, supporters of Government, intend moving that no amendments shall be discussed, but only the report itself. There is no longer any attempt made to keep up even an appearance of fair play and free discussion. The Queen being now officially enceinte, rejoicings have been ordered. aud denutations from both Chambers went yesterday evening to present their congratulations. It has been ordered that the C0ourt and garrison should wear full dress for three days, commencing yesterday; and now, wherever one goes, one sees carriages full of ribbons, stars, and embroideries. Last night there were illuminations; that is to say, the Palace and public buildings were ilUminated; but the people of Madrid abstained, wi6h remarksble unanimity, from any expenditare of wax or oil. To-day there is a besamanos at the Palace. Lord Hlowden had an audience of the Queen last night, to take leave previously to going on leave of absence. He starts for France next weelk During his absence Mr. Otway acts as Charg6 d'Affaires. A newspaper says that the exportation of cattle from Galicia to England has of late years been so great that oxen have become quite scarce in that province, and that several vessels which lately arrived at Corunna for cargoes of that description had to go away in ballast. The law for the enlargement and improvement of the Puerte del Sol has received the Royal santion, and it is said that the works are at once to be actively proceeded with. Madrid will believe this when it actually sees it, but I think not befora. The law authorizing the Government to ratify th) frontier treaty with France passed the Congress yesterday, only three Deputies voting against it. It is said that Prince Lucien Bonaparte, the philologist, has been for a week in Madrid, preserving, however, so strlot an 'ncognito that his arrival was not known until after his departure. SWITZERLAND. The Federal Council of Switzerland has just addressed a circular to the Cantonal Govermments) announcing the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty relative to NeuchateL "Thus," says the Council, "has an affair which threatened the Con- federatioa with serious complications and danger3 received (with the aid of Providence) a solation as advantageous as it is honourable." The Council declares that the solution "is principally due to the high wisdom and moderation of the mediating Powers, and to the spirit of equity which prevailed in the appreciation of difficulties." It says that, in virtue of the treaty, the canton of N'euchatei will occupy in the eyes of the European Powers the same position in the Confederation as all other cantons; and though this fact was never doubtful to Switzerland, it thinks the admission of it by those Powers a matter of great importance. The Swiss Federal Assembly, which is to meet for its ordinary session on the 6th July, wMll have to discuss several matters of interest, and amongst them new railway schemes, the Federal guarantee to be given to the new constitution of the canton of Fribourg, and the proposition for an amnesty to the chief of the Sonderbund, M. Siegwart MilUer. THE BALLOT. HIOUSE OF COMMONS, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 30. DIVISION.

SENEGAT,.-Accoontt from Senegal to the 12th Mac. have arrived. The rising of the Marabouts of Al Hadji had focned the F'rench, in the upper countrv, to ally themselves with the Moors against the blacks, aind the Dousich were serving them well. In the Bor,dou a man named Ely Amady Caba had risen against Boubakar Saada, and after collecting 6,000 men had taken possession of the fortified village of Amadhie. He had formally refused topay tribute to Boubakar, and had threatened to shoot any one who should demand it. On this Boubakar attacked him, but was repulsed with a lose of 10 ki,ca ad wounded, and retired in disorder to Sileng. As Boubakar Is on the French side, Captain Cornu, Commander of Bakel, and U. Girardot, Commander of Senou Debou, marched to A madhie with 166 men and a howitzer; and they induced the Moors and the Malink, though not without difficulty, to join them. Just as they were about to attack Amadhie a horseman came galloping out to therm; he was the son of Ely, and offered his father's submission. He was told that Ely himself must make his submission, and that chief did so. His followers were disarmed, and a portion of thera were se4t to the adjacent villages; the rest were taken prisoners, and the horses and oxen of the whole bahd were captured; The booty was subsequently handed over to BoubakaL Saada. This chief afterwards proceeded to subject the district of Ferlo, which remained in revolt ; he burned down three villages, killed 156 men, took 140 prisoners and 650 oxen. Mis own loss was 23 dilled or wounded. In consequence of his success it was not doubted that the populations would submit. Their submission would make him master of all the Bondou.

In several localities the cro is pronounced the best known for yeas, the swathe helx so exceedingly heavy. Clover and rye grass have turned toot Cnnsu rrr FnalcE.-On the 23d of December last a man named Souffares, occupying the post of professor at the Xormal School ab Touloume, tealked quiety into the house of Mi. Broustet, professor at the School of Fine Arts in the same city, and shot him dead, after which he took to fUght aend two days after oadame Souffares, ife of the apspily, threw herself headforemost from theswindow of her bedroom and was killed instantaneously. Souffare8, after remaining absent for some time, gave himself up to justice, and three daysag e was brought to trial for his crime before the Court of Assihes of Toulouse. The facts of the case were these:-For some time Souffares lived pahappily with his wife, their pecuni.ry circumstances not being good, and he being of a harsh, jealous disposition. He often iU-treated the woman without any just cause and towards the latter end of Last year he did so more than ever, owing to her mother having threatened to take legal proceedings to compel him to pay her a small annuity which he owed. at the begining of December MI. Brousbet, havingt occasion to sell some8school desks and forms, thought that Souffaeres, who llved in the same street as himself, the Hue des Cimetiares St. Aubin, might, he being a professor, and having a brother a schoolmaster, help him to dispose of them, and, though not knowing him, he went to his house in a neighbourly way. Souffares was absent, and he stated his busi ness to Iadame Souffares; a conversation sprang up botween them, and the woman imprudently made known to hia her pecuniary embarrassments and her domesticsorrows. He' mnifested great interest in her, and promised to see on her behalf a notary who had something to do withnerhusband'sI affairs. A few days later he called at about 4 o'clock in the I afternoon, when, as usual, her husband was engaged in his I usual duties at the Normal SchooL. After some conversation he made propositions to her which sbe at first rejected; but after a while she yielded to him. The next day Broustet not only saw the notary about her affairs, but paid some bils she owed and took them to her A few days after he paid her another visit, and, according to the declarations subsequently made by the woman, again: effeoted his purpose. He afterwards proposed to establish a regular connexion with the woman, and made Inquiries as to the habits of her husband, so as not to run the risk of being found at the house by him; but the woman became horror-struck at what had taken place, and refused to com- a ply. In her despair, according to one of her female friends, whom she took into her confidence, sbe contemplated suicide, but was dissuaded from it by the friend. Her manner, however, became so strange that her husband perceived that something was wrong, and he pressed her to tell him what it was; she at last, at 6 o'clock in the morning of the 23d of December, revealed what had taken place bcetween ! her and Broustet. The man immediately took the resolution to hi avenged on the adulterer, and at 7 he went out anld settled various matters, as if he were about to leave the town. At night he returned home and loaded two pistols, but, as his wifeexpressedalarm lest he should do anymischief, ho said ho would depositthem in anotherroom. He,however, walked straight to the houee of Broustet, and after teLing the servant to announce himwalked into the studio,inwhich Broustet, who was a sculptor, was worling at a bust in Vlaster. Broustet, hearing the name of his visitor, turned wards the door, and at the same moment Souffares fired one of his pistols at him; the ball entered the neck, wounded the carotid artery, and passing out on the other side went through a pane In the window and fell into the street. Broustet ran to the window, waved his hand with agitation, and cried out "Murder !" but the moment after he fell down and expired. Souffares, after firing, walked quietly down stairs, and as he did eO was heard to exclaim, " I a now satisfied-I am aveiiged." In the street he met a friend named Marcou, and said to him with eome agitation, :' M. Broustet has violated my wife, and I have just avenged myself on him !" At that moment he heard Broustet's servants crying, "Murder! There is the assassin, Arrest him n! and ho took to flight and got clear off. His wie was distracted at hearing what had taken place, and on the 25th took advantage of the temporary absence of a woman who had been chareed to watch over her to commit Euicide in the manner dssmribed. THE IxsH CoNSTxnuiARY.-The following was the effective strength of the Irish constabulary force on the 1at of January, 1857:-viz, 5 first-rate county inspectors, 22 second-rate, and 8 third-rate; 6, 77, 80, and 86 extrarate, first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate sub-inspectors, 1 extra-rate, 55 first-rate, and 270 second-rate.

THE PUBLIC IIALTR. (From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return) The number of deaths registered in London in the week that ended on Saturday, the 27th of June, was 1,05. In the ten years 1847.56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,090 ; but, as the deaths of last week occurred in an increased population, the average should be raised with a view to comparison proportionally to the increase, in which case it will become 1,199. The deaths now returned were therefore less by 194 than would have occurred if the average rate of mortality towards the end of June had prevailed. The deaths produced by the zymotic or epidemic class of diseases were last week 195; the corrected average of cerresponding weeks is 264. The mortality of this class is considerably less than usual; and on reference to particular heads it will be seen that the reduction is in typhus (in. cluding common fever), scarlatina, and smallpox. Four cases of smallpox and one of varicella (chickenpox) were fatal in the week. Although the heat was excessive, and the mean temperatre of last week higher by S deg. than that of the previous three weeks, the mortality from diarrhcea has not yet shown any imnportant increse; the weekly deaths from this complaint during June having been 26, 20, 35, and 33. Besides the 33 of last week, three deaths of children were registered as caused by " English cholera" and " cholera infantum." Whooping-cough, vhich carried off 46 children, and, in the nex- place, measles, which carried off 36, are at present the mest fatal diseases of the zymotic description. Three deaths from measles are returned from each of the fo?1owing sub-districts:-West REEkuey, St. Clement Danes, and Mile-and Old-town Lower. Five children died of whoop;ng cough in the sub-district of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Three persons are recorded as having died of intemperance, besides Eix cases in vhich the cause of death is stated to be deli-ium tremems. A death which occurr d in IMay, and on which an inquest was held, was caused bv stAV. vation. The two oldest persons in the returns are women, aged respectively 91 and 95 years. Last week the births of 867 boys and S05 girls, in all 1,672 children, Tere registered in London. In the ten corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number wa3 1,568. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 30 05S in. The mean daily reading was above 30 in. on five days; the highest reading attained was 30 25 in. on Thursday. The mean temperature of the week wes 67V3 deg., which is 69 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). On four days the mean tem. perature was from S deg. to 10 deg. above the average. The highest timperature in the sbade occurred on Saturday, and was 8-5 deg.; the highest in the sun occurred on the samue day, and was 16 deg. The lowest tethperature was 50 7 deg. on Thursday, and the range of the week was 37-8 deg. The mean dew-ptiut temperature was 582 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 91 deg. Ths mean temperature of the waterof the Than:es w,as 6aS deg. On Saturday the thermometer in the river roseto 71-7 deg. The air was frequently calm. Rain fell on Sunday to the amount of 021 in. None fell during the rest of the week.

UMBETDG OF SCOTCH 1ME1iBBS.-On Friday last a meeting of all the Members of Parliament for Scotland, without distinction of party, was held at the Lord Advo. cate's ch3mbers, London, forthe purpose of considering the various Scotch Bills now before Parliament. Considerable discussion, we hear, took pace regarding the Lunacy Bill. with the result of the seconu reading being postponed for 10 days, and a unatimous understanding being arrived at that the Bill should pass witioUt opposition, on condition of certain chamges being nmade upon it, the e:dstence of the Board to be limited to five years, the period required for establishing asylums and setting the Act fairly in motiozithe duties of inspection to be thereafter continued by t1,e two paid commimsioners, with their secretary and c],'Irk smaking their reports to the Horne-office; the law 'o ba enforced upon the local boards by the ordinary lep Al tri. binals, called ito operation by the Home Secretary, on the re%resentation of the comnisosers; and eaich runtyto judge for itself whether it hall erect an assluin f or itaelf or aomiwith ether eouties, a ruffielentprovitivdof asylua acmoomodation, of course, remaining OomPn' ory.

Oa the Court of SeEsion TAlR there were it la understood, considerable differenoes df opinion, and it was agreed to postpone the second ing for eight or 10 days. On the other Bills there was r,o discussion, and they were read a second time in the House of Commons the sams evening.-Scotsman.
.T?fONEY-MARKETand OLTY £NTI?2LLJ (,? k&O1??* T'uesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 4. per mUle premium, and the short exchange ou London is 25.25 per It. sterling. On comparinig these rates withl tho En,glish Mint price of 31. 17. Mi.d. per ounce for standard gold it appears ithat gold is about l-lOth per cent. dearer in Paris than in London. By advices from Hamburg the prioe uf gold is 4234 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 33.3S per 1L. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 3- tOths per cent. dearer irn Hamburg than in London. The coulrse of exchange at Now York .n London for bills at 60 days' sight is 109k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchauge is slightly in favour of England; and, after ruakisig &Llowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves a small profit on the iraportation of gold from the United States. The English funds opened steadily this morning at a recovery of an eighth, but some large speculative sales soon caused a fresh decline. Consols for the 9th of July were first quoted 922 to J ex. dividend, and the last official price was 92i to J. At a later hour there were buyers at 92k, in consequence of favourable statements regarding the quarter's revenue. Bank Stock closed 212 to '214A; Reduced, 921 to 4; Newr Three per Cents., 9242 to i; India Bonds, lOs. to 5s. discount; and Exchequer Bonds, 98g to J. Exchequer-bills, notwithstanding a most active demand for money, were again slightly higher, the quotations being 6s. to 2s. diacou nt. The pressure in the discount-market und at the :Bank of England to-day was extremely heavy at full rates. This, however, is frequently the case on the last day of the half-year. Intforeign stocks it was settling day, but the transactions were not very numerous. Peruvian experienced a rise of nearly 3 per cent. in consequence of a convention between the Peruvian Government and France and England to secure the guano receipts pledged for the foreign debt. A few days ago a transaction took place in the Five per Cents. at 78,4, and to-day they were bought at 80 and 81. The Three per Cents. wer quoted 55. In other foreign stocks the bargains comprisedChilian, 103; Danish Three per Cents, 94i ; ditto Five per Cents., 102 and 101 ; Mexican, 22i; Sardinian, 89,4, I, i; Spanish Certificates, 6i, ; Turkish Six per Cents., 956, J for mnoney, and96 aud 954 for the account; the Four per Cents., 102 for money, and 1014 for the account; Dutch Twvo-and-a-H3alf per Cents., 65,. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 65c. for money, and 67f. 45c. for the monthly settlement now in progress, showing in the latter case a further decline of nearly a quarter per cent. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were the same as last post. More than 60,0001. in American gold was sold to the Bank to-day. Some rather large parcels of sovereigns continue also to be received frora Ireland and Scotland. The specie brought by the Atrato to-day is 190,0001., of which only 80,0001. is silver, the shipment from Mexico having been unusually smalL The steamer next month, however, will bring alarge amount, a conducta having left the city of Mexico for Vera Cruz two days before the departure of the present mnail with nearly400,00o. Subjoined is a table of the fluctuations in the stock and share markets during the past month. The range of Consols has been unusually small, the difference between the highest and lowest prices being only 4 per cent. The Bank bullion having experienced anl increase of 1,300,0001., the tendency of prices was generally towards imnprovement until the arrival of the overland mail with the news of the Indian mutiny. The railway-market has been comparatively firm, and in several cases a rise has been established - F.VJOTUA'TIONS IN TEC STOoK AND SlAEX MAtpRKTf. DURWIG THE MoNTwI Or Ju.x, 1857. On the foreign Botrses during the month there has been general heaviness. At Paris some tendency to revival ras exhibited at the commencement, and ? tbere has gince been a fall of 1A per cent. from the highest price attained. The decline established from the quotations of the Ist of June is a per cent. The following are the railway calls for the month of July so far as they have yet been advertised. They are altogether unusually heavy, and include large payments on Great lvuxembourg and LobroAeein of which, however, only limited portions are held in this countrg: -- U.WYs fix±u± iviexico ny the present Mail i8 not important. The annexed mercantile letter refers to the expectations entertained of an amicable arrangement with Spain and the steps adopted by the Mexican Governmnent for satiSfying the English demands arising out of the robbery of the British Consulate at St. uis some months ago. The writer also gives several particulars, which will be of interest at Manchester, regarding the capabilities and prospeCts of Mexico as a cotton-growing country:- " Mexico, June 2. "lNothing of great importauce has traspired here since my last on the 3d nlt. A fresh conspiracy was discovered a few days sinco, but, as that iS an everyday occurrence, it -would have been forgotten just as soon as discovered were It not for the sensation caused aniong the inhabitants of the capital by seeing the conspirators led out in chains the nextb morning, and forced to work in cleaning the public sewers. Such an act of severity is so unusual sinong the Mexicnms that a general burst of disapprobation was the consequence, and the Government was induced to adopt a different courso. The conspirators were accordingly sent to Acapulco I as exiles. with the exception of an officer named Herran, who is to be tried for the seizure of the condueta money at San Luis, and the affront offered to the British flag on that occasion, for it appears that this fellow was the very man who perpetrated that disgraceful deed. "The Government has been making some preparations lately to meet the exigencies of a war with Spain, and, as usual, the ftirst step taken was the indiscriminate and most arbitrary seizure of men, forced into the army, in spite of all the liberal principles proclaimed by the famous ' Plan de Ayntla.' However, the prevailing opiznon now is that all the difficulties pending between the two Governments will be peacefully and satisfactorily arranged in Europe. " In spite of the Government's habitual state of penury, nothig had leeon done to retrieve the finances of the country, but a decree was published a few days since levying an extraordinary tax upon income produced by all real estate, and to bo paid only once. Were not all Mexican Govern. menit so indifferent with regard to the payment of their debts, it is certain that they migbt lhave adopted various sohemes which would have enabled them to meet their pecuniary engagemeuts with great facility; but unfortu. nately for maty years past no Administration has shown any sincere desire to put an end to the dishonourable prac. tice of deceiving their creditors with all mannerof promises, which only amount to go many empty words. Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires lr. Lettsann, has, however, shown hineelf a perfect model of zeal and alacrity in the discharge of his dutty, and it certainly is not his fault if British subet, do not meet with better treatment fromn the Mexican Govesmmt, The Jau Luis affair id said two hae beeI arranged by promi.ing to pay the amount through au aEsignmcnt on the Custont-houses, but the question is v bether it will not remain in promises. " Observing by tbe newspapers that the Manchester people 'eem inolined to look oat for a supply of cotton from other quarters besides the United States, it may be well to ca3l again your attention to the facility with which that staple article is obtained over a vast extent of the Mexican territory; in fact, it grows wild in all the warmer regions of the Republic, and the quality is generally very good. Indeed, were it not for the unconquerable indolence of the Mexicans, a large quantity of cotton nmight be exported every year just as easily as it is even now from Texas, which was until very lately s Mexican province. About one-third of the cotton consumed throughout the Republio by Mexicanfactories (which are very insignificant) is grown in the country, and theremainder is brought from New Orleans; but itis beyond all doubt that, as soon as the Americans ' annex' the whole of Meexico, the production of cotton will be wonderfully increased, more especially as it may be planted here in the wild regions, where Atrican labour is not required, and where the Indian race thrives, and is rather numerous eiven now." The Committee of MIexican Bondholders report as follows - " The committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated Mexico, 2d ult. Payments continued suspended in all the ports except Mazatlan and Manzanillo. The agents of the bondholders in the former port bad forwarded $3,796 by way of Panama, retaining $1,167 in bils for collection; and the agents in Mancanillo had recovered up. wards of $21,000, which ib was also intended to forward by way of Panama. OenorYglesiss bad been appointed Minister of Finance in lieu of Senor Fuentes, who resumes the Ministrzy of Foreign Affairs. The new Minister of Finance is thoroughly conversant with the business of the foreign debt, and it is much to be desired that his health may prove equal to the toil and the great difficulties of his new office.

The yield continues with a regularity on the average which is very satisfactory, though some variations occur, from which no mine is exerapt. A slight deterioration in San Maximo during the last week had occurred, from which circumstance, though chiefly from a holyday, the veek's extraction was 700 cargas, the previous three weeks having given 850 each. The general result had been improvement, the ore extracted during the present month having exceeded that obtained in April by 634 cargas, In which month also there was an excess of 366 cargas above the previoues month's extraction. The present state of the works is as follows:-In the frentes of San Pantaleon and San Maximo, and the Pozos of San Maximo and La Purissima, the vwidth of ore varies from one to two varas; these works are to the north. In the frente and Pozo of Dolores, to the south, the ore is from five to siX varas -wide, and the ley, previously very good, had further improved. On the 27th about 1,400 cargas had been sold, and produced $6,991. This is the only salo which had taken place durirg the month, but 2,671 cargas had been sent to the haciendas of Dolores and Duran; these haciendas are now fuUy employed in the reduction of-ores, and the yield of the Tortas at Dolores gives a very Satisfactory profit, besides that more immediately belonging to the mine, Duran had been too short a time in operation to produce as yet any returns, but it would certaly do so during June."

S9 0ous ACCXDENT TO AN EXC SION TAIN.- The annual bolyday of the factory operatives in Wigau was held on SaturdaZ last, And excursion trips to Liverpool and Blackpool by raway were arranged for. A large nm-mber of the factory operatives- about 5,000 altogether-availed themselves of the faclities thus afforded for a day's recreation, by far the larger proportion selecting Liverpool as the scene of their day's enjoyment. The day was remakably fine, And those who went to Blackpool experienced nothing to mar their pleasure. Unfortunately, however, the Liver Iool exctsion closed with a painful accident, by which a lge number of persons were more or less injured. The first zeturn train left Liverpool about 25 minutes to 7 o'clock. On reaching Kirby station the train was delayed, in order to collect the tickets, as is usual in the case of excursion trains. While thus waiting a luggage train from Itverpool was seen approaching. The usual signal was given; and, in addition, the passengers, whto had become aware of the danger, did all they could to warn the driver of the luggage train by shouting, waving of handkerchiefs, &c., but 5ti1 the train approached; and, seeing the danger imminent, many jumped out, and so escaped. Xmmediately afterwards the collision took place, and a scene of confusion ensued which may be better imagined than described. As soon as possible after the collision steps were taken to ascertain the number of sufferers and to afford them all practicable relief. The number of persons injured was found to exceed 70. Those whose ia. juries appeared most serious were taken to a publichonse an irlby, and there every possible aid was temnporarily suppised. Those who were uninlured, or injured but little were brought on to Wigan by the same train, and, as the carnages were much shattered, they proceeded at a very slow pace, and reached the Wigan station about half-pastI. The intelligence was rapidly circulated, and the excitement became intense. This being the first return train, only a comparativelysmallnumberofthe excursionists proceeded byit, andtheutmostanxiety was manifested by relatives and friends of those who remained absent. The excitement oontinued up to a late hour, when the last of the return trains arrtved, and a vast crowd assembled and remained for hours outstde the station in the Wallgate. Surgical aid ws rendered to all the sufferers who had arrived, and a special train conveyed all the surgeons in the town to the sceno of tho accident. Some of the sufferers who had been left at Kirby were brought home by later trains, and others were kept there until Sunday morning. Fortunately, no deaths have wet ensued, although one or two of the sufferers ate regarded as in a very preoarious condition. Of one little hope is entertained. The driver of the lugzage trsiu was taken into custody and brought on to Wlgaj, where Ite still xemains. ShouLldnodeathtake place inthe course of to-day, he will be handed over to the county police. During Sunday most of the sufferers -were visited by Ir. Blackmore and others, and pecuniary assistance was rendered them by the company. lt is stated that at the Kirbr sta-ion the on persons appointed to collect the tickets from about 1,400 persor in the train were aman and a boy, and that the work of collecting bad proceeded about 20 minlutes, andwava Grclfen of 7'esterday. ?kr
7'2"12s OP.F.VROV. HoUSEB OF LIOS. JtNw .O CROWF V. LUMLJV A Vn A1srr.. TXhe arguments on behalf of the plaintiff n error were conoluded this morni8g. On behalf of the defendants in error it was contended that there was no pretence for considering the judgments obtainedI against MUr. Lutmley as mortgages or encambranoes within the meaning of the words of the covenants. It was clear that by giving the warrants of attorney upon which the juxdgments were obtained Mfr. Lumley had created no charge upon the estate, for the power of disposal vested in inr was not restricted until after the registered judgments were obtained. The act of obtaining those judgmeents was not Mr. Lumley's act, and therefore he had no hand in encumbering the estate. Judgments were particularly distinguished trom mortgages, for no mortgage could be granted of church property, and yet judgments might be obtainea under warrants of attorney, and charge thus created upon the land. With respect to the boxes being let for more than a year, it vas tabuitted that the mere tbet of letting boxes just before the end of the season of 1852 to different persons from those to whoTn they were then let for the season of 1853 could not be bell ut be a breach of the covena"ts in the lease, for it would have beena impossible for Mr. Lumley to have carried on the business of the Opera-house without securing the lettingof ls boxesfortheensuingseason. Ift wa also sub. msitted that there had been no substantial lease granted for more than a year, iasmucch asthe contingencies upouwhich the lease of the boxes had been granted-namely, the opening of the theatre, had not happened at the time the action was brought. Uader the6e circumstances it was contenided that there had been no forfeiture of the lease. With regard to the nestion of waiver, it was conterded that money as pal to Mr. Croft as rent, and that in accordance wih the rules of law the creditor must apply money paid him by his debtor to the purpose named by the latter at the time of paYing'it. The ATTorms( (E IzA-L having replied, The LoaD CH cELon put certain questions to the learned judges involving the points in the case. The learned JuDGmS requested time to consider their opinion.

Kinrzv- m te question in this cause turned upon the construction of the will of William Randfield, whidh bore date on the 18th of October, 1837, bnt was not executed until the 14th of February, 184 The testator, after directing paymernt of hts debts, funeral nd testhamontary espenses, and of tslying up copyhold8, devised bis real estates, which were specaied, to lis son William Cass Pnmdfield, after bis (tho testatorms) decease, and when he should have attained 21, subject to an annuuityand specHfic gifts to his wife, and the wvill went on as follows:- ¶Et shtaould tbe hand of deaith fall on mr widow.

Mr. Baily and Mr. Shebbeare appeared for the widow of the son; Mr. Swvcston and Mr. Kay for the widow of the testator; Mr. (larae and 3Mr. Dickinson for the parties clainmn the pit over, The VICE-3AwELLO}C thought that, as far as the firet part of this singular will was concerned, there was no doubt that there was an absolute gift of realty and personalty to the son, subject to the wif0s annuity, although even upon that there was some ambiguity. The principle upon which the Courts proceeded in sceh cases was that an absolute gift ought not to he cat down by anything subsequent anless the jntention was clear. 1Now, tshe subsequent clause was so doubtful1 that the prior gift to the son must prevail, and he took an absolute interest.
2fLU BJIIMflGHAM CANAl NAVIGATION COMPANY V. VTNTgT.T C (Before Vice-Chancelor SirW. P. WOOD.] The Court was occupied for several hours with this motion for an injunction, which was commenced on Mndaay. The defendants are the lessees of certain coal mines in the neighbourhood of a tunnel through which the above canal passes, called the Dadley tunnel, and the object of the motion was to obtain either an absolute injunction to prevent the defendants from working the parts of their mines subjacent or adjacent to the tunmel so as to endanger its safety, or, in the alternative, that subject and without prejudice to such right to compensation (if any) as the defeadants mnight be entitled to under certain Acts of Parliament, tbey might be restrained froam working such parts of the mines as lie Qnder the tunnel or Within 20 yards of the same. The whole cage eventually turned entirelv on the legl construction of the numerous clauses in the various Acts of Parliament by which the rights of the company and owners of adjacent mines are regulated, and upon the question whether one of these Acts had not, in fact, been repexled by the others, the defendants not denying their intention of worlng the parts of the nisesto whichthe notice of motion referred, and admitting the danger of doing so, but claiming as of right to do so until the plaintiffs should take the pro steps pointed out (as they alleged) by the Acts cf Para ment for bying up their interest In such parts of the mines, and whiob interestthey statedat-npwards of 13,0001. Te plaintiffs, on the other hand, disputea the conasruction put by the defendants onL the Acts of Parliament, mnd claimed, in addition to the rights and privileges given by the Acts, to be entitled to an injunctlon on the priciple of common law right, as recently laid down by the Hnuseof Lords in the case of the " Caledonian Railway v. Sprot" and other c&e~s, oontonding that the evidence went to show that any further workidng in the neigibourbood of the tunnel, whether within the 20 yards the limits pointed out by one of the Acts) or beyond them, would materialy a cndanger the safety of their property 3Mr. Rolb, Mr. Daniel, and ar. `i R. RIawkins for the maotion 3Mr. Cairns and Ifr. W. D. Lewis in opposition. The Vim-CuALczm ors said, that there was no sufficient evidence of danger in working beyond the 20 yards, and therefore it was imposible for the Court to grant an unqualified injunction to restrain the defendants' workings; but, on the general grounds of preventing irreparable dges by the possible letting down of the whole water of the canal, the Court would interfere to the extent asked for by the alternative part of the prayer of the billnamely, the working wmtbim 20 yards of the tunnel, leaving the legalrights ofthepartiesundertheActs of Parliament to be decided in some action or other proceeding at law, which mlght bc had immediately. The facts not being in dispute, there could be no difficulty in the parties arranging as to the best and most effective mode of having these rights decided at once by a court of law, and for this pur soe the case night be put on the paper again on Thursday (tomorrowl. As to the com3onm law right which had been indsted upon for the plaintiffs, similar to that in the case of " the Caledonian Railway v. Sprot," there might posibly be some suoh right beyond the provisions of these Acts of Parliament, but as to this his Honout said he expressed no opinion. JAP.oU)D AIUD OTMRS V.

H. aewis appeared for the plaintiff; and Mfr. Bovill, Q.C., and M£r. X spland for the defendants The plaintiff in this action, J. Forrester, was a carman in the employ of a Mr. Collier, and he sued the defendants, Messrs. xearns and Co., of the Red lion-wharf, in Upper Thames-street, to recover damages for nn injury which he had sustained by the negligence of the defendanW servants. It appeared that on the 9th of December last the plaintiff went with a van to the defendants' wharf to fetch some cases of figs. Three cases had'been lowvered down from the fifth story in the usual way, and the plaintiff was waiting to receive the fourth case ito the van. There was some little delay, and the plaintiff was turning to sit down on the rail of the van, when the fourth case desoended with unusal rapidity and struck the plaintiff on the chest, and knocked him over the bide of the van. He was immediatelytaken to the London Hospital, suffering from concussion of the brain and other Injuries; hat aStor 11 days ho was discharged, though he continued for some time an oat-patient. Th defendants had assisted the plaintifF with moneytosome etent during his iUness; but, as they had not made any adequate compensation, the present action was brougbt. Mdr. Bovm, for the defendants, said the accident was owing to the plaintiffPs own negligence in notproperly looking out and watching for the descent of the case, andhe called several witnesses who stated that when the draught descended the plaintiff was sitting on the ralof the van, with his head between his hands. Ho suddenly startd up and knocked his head against the case, which immediately recoiled upon him and knocked him over the van Lord CArPBE1LL having summed up the evidence, left it to the jury to say whether the accident was occasioned bv the negligence of the defendants' servants or by the plaisiife fwn fault. The jury retired to consider their vordictk and ultimately found for the plaintiff-.Damages, 90. ALCOOK V. BEGG AND OTH3DRS. Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. J. Wilde, QC., and Mr. J. Brown for the ddfendants. The plaintiff iu this action, T. a. Alcock, was a shipowner at Sunderland, and he sued the defendants, Bessrs. Begg and Co., merchants at Glasgow, to recover damages for t loading a cargo on board the plaintiWs shp the Senegal, charered by the defendants. By the chatera dated the 29th of January, 1855, the veesel was to oe oen board a, argo of coals at Sunderland, and discharge the same at St. Thomas's, in the West Indies. The vessel was thento proceed to TrLnidad, nd to take i ncago to be provlded by the defendants It appeared that the vessel salled from Sudelhad on the 3&of March, but, having met with boisterous weather, it did not reach St. Thomas's tlll the 23d of ; pr5L It dl6ch edit oin32 days, being at the rats of a kol (21 to.a day. t wan then dtned ten-days on deurg, and hvlngto undergo some repairs and to take in ballast, the vessel was detained e5ght days longer, and did not ai till the 13th of June. It arnived in due course at Trinidad on the 28th of June, but the defendants' agenthaa nob pro. vided Any Car=o, and, the seasonu b1zsi.ly ow t ieh sbip was obligecl to return with. deficient cargo. The ,reen action was therefore brought to zereraovThe forese breach of contract, and the plaintifr claimed B46r for freight and 2001. for demurrage and detention. llr. WLDZ, for the defendants, said the defence wag that, after the vessel had siled from England, the plaintiff by the master had been guilty of great and unreasonable delay, whereby the defendants had lost the season for load. tcg a cro and the benefit of the charterparty. Several mitnesses were called for the defence, who stated that in the Wesb IndA trade it was nacessary for the vessel to go round the coast and collect the cargo from the varlouspointato which produce was brought down from the plantations. The Senegal did not arrive at Trinidad till the 28th of June, amd the sson was considered over by the lst ofAugust- but if the vessel had arrived earlier, the defendants, durang the 47 days allowed for loadinrg would have been able tD get a full cargo, which, under the circumstances, they ad no opportunity of doing. The de. fendantk' agent, however, did his best, it being agreed thaz the freight so carried should go In reduction of the plaina tifs claim, if he was entitled to make any.

DACEY V. THE SOuIrlr-?SAZTlZR n&AiWAY 0o0n3ANY Mr. Se;jeant Balantine and Mr. P. H. Lewis appeared fortheplaintiff; and hEr. Semeant Shee and&Mr.Peters* dorfffor the defendants. The painff in this action, Daniel Dcoev, was a littl bov aboDIt 12 years old, who, by his next frLien, sued the Soutth Eastern lailway Comapany, to recover dmages for an in. jury which the plaintiff had sustained by the negligence of the defendants servants, It appeared from the plainti's evidence that, on the 1Sth fof October last onLe of the compsny's large sugar vans wag drven from Vlitechapel into Aiddlesex-street The Street a's the entrance was extremely narrow, being little more thn the width of the waggon, with a kerb of about 14 inches in width. The carman was lying down Inthe van' but the horses were led by a young man, who was walking at the leader's head, As the van turned into ths street, from Whitechapel, the van strack against a ttone placed on the kerb to protect the story-post of the Fssex Tavern, and it was said this had the effect of jolting the vn towards the other side of the street. Tha plaintiff, who was on the kerb on that side, was ksockee down and rn over, audhis leg was broken. Ee was takewz to the London Bospital, where every attention was paid tot lIm. but he 'was at1 smuch a cripple that he was oblige& to be carried into court, and, according to the medical evidence, he was likely to be a cripple for Iffe. The little boy stated that he was going down the right hand side ot Middlesex-street on the day in question, aLnd whien lie heard the noise of the van coming behind him he tureca back and eudeavouxe to get intothe side door of the Btsil' Head publichouse, but finding that there were two women there, andthat there was not rooma for him, he went back. By this time the van had come up, and he was immediately knocked down and run over. Mr. Serjeant Snxn, for the defence, Eaid he should call witnesses to show that the company's servants were entirely free from blame, and that the accident was owing to the boy's own carelessness. Several witnesses were then ex. amined, and, ccording to their evidence, the greatest care had been taken In entering the street to avoid any aodi. dent. One of the witnesses, a young woman, who was at her fathees door near the spot, Said she saw the boy stand lag with his back to the wall to let the van pass but thet kerb beig worn and slanting to the road, his foot alipped,I and he fell with his leg under the wheels. The witnesses all agreed that the spot in question is of the most dangerons desnption, and that several persons have been illed there already. Since the accident the kerb had been repaired, but as the defile itself is merely the entrance to Middlesex.street. a7daa Petticoat-lane, it is not improbable that "Dead. man's-corner will stil remain. Lord C0AxpIE,T in summing up the evidence, said he could not see that the boy had been guilty of any negligence; the only question for the jury, therefore, would be whether the accident was caused by the negligence of the company's servants. The jury retired to consider their verdict, and, not being ble to agree thereupon, were locked up; ultimately they returned at 9 o'clock, and gave a verdict for the de' fendants. SECOND COURT.

The pleadinga were vory voluxnilonp and the substantial question raisei upon them was whether the defendant took her and kept her In custody after he had notice that she was not the person named in a writ of c. sa. uider which she had been. arrested. It appeared that the plaintiffs sister, Emily Mary Dunstan, and herself had, in the mouth of December last, gone to the chambers of a Mr. Apps for the purpose oE Emiy's borrowing some meney, and that while the sistet was engaged upon that business she waited in an outer office for some time, where there was a maan named Chandler, Apps's cerk.

IN RE BALDW3N. The bankrupt was a printer of Shoe-Lane. This was an examination meeting. Mr. CHiDLaY tendered a claim for 3281. on the part of Mr. Knox, as editor of the Morning Herald, of which Mr. Baldwin was the proprietor, being for arrears of salary of 13 guineas per week as editor of tbat journal. * An order was made for the payment of 3Ol. to Mr. Knox in full, the remaining part of the claim being adjonmed for consideration.

This was an adiourned hearing of a petition for adjudication of bankruptcy against Messrs. Smith, Filder, Smith, and Sorivens, proprietors of the above bank. The proceedIngs at the original hearing were reported in Tle Times of Monday last. 'Upon Mr. Wilkinson again attending to opea the adjudication, advantage was taken of an erroneous report in three of the papers of this morning to the effect that Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque had yesterday animadverted UPOn the impropriety of publishing in T/re Tiames and other papers the proceedings in this matter on Saturday to ask that the case might now be taken in a private room. The CONMrSSIONXR said ho was inclined to continue tho hearing in open court, and leave the representatives of the press to exercise their usual discretion; after what had been said, however, he would take the case in piivate. At the termination of these proceedings information was obtained that an adjudication of bankruptcy had been made, ;and that the petition had been balloted to Mr. Whitmore, official assignee. ' Had the reporters for the Daily HewS, the Morning Advertiser, and the Morning PosG been at their post on Saturday they would have known that Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque's observations referred to tho inmproper publication of some proceedings in a petty csue in his own court, and which proceedings were not published in The Times, although, for anything that is known to the contrary, they may have been published in its three contesnporaries; who have thus sought to abridge the privileges of the press. Mr. Commiesioner Fonblanque and Mr. Commissioner Holroyd disposed of a number of cases that do not call for detailed reports. Kiemp and Clay, bill brokers, of Nicholas-Lane, passed their examination. T. White, jun., shipbuilder, of Portsmouth, was awarded a first-class certificate. A second-class certificate was awarded to T. Wells, grocer, Clapham-road. An order was made changing the day of hearing for the adjourned application on the Rart of creditors to expunge a proof by Messrs. Laing and Uampbeli against the estate of J. Windle Colo. Messrs.

INSOLVEN/V DEBTORS COURT. Tune 30. IN RE JOUR LASEMIR. (Before Ar. Commissione4P MUR1PTIV- 'I'his insolvent, who had been a boot and shoo maker near Grantham, in lancolushire, was opposed by Mr. Dowse for several creditors, and Mr. Sargood supported. The comoplaint was that the insolvent had obtained a quantity of goods in a short time, a portion of which went to a person named Gray, at Reigate, with whom tho insolvent was connected, and to whom he alleged he owed 841. Mr. Commissioner MuRPHY cons'Aered that a debt was owing to Gray, but thero had 14en a s'stematic making away with property, and therefore pronounced a judgment of eight calendar months from the vesting order. IN RE JA3S ASHLEY. This insolvent, described as a gentleman, formerly hotel keeper at Melbourne, was opposed by Mr. Dowse for the detaining creditor, Mr. Greenwood, a jeweeUer in Hanwaystreet, Oxford-street; Mr. Sargood supported. Mr. Greenwood was said to bethe only creditor, and his debt was denied, although he had obtained a judgment by default. The claim was for the maintenance of his daughter, the wife of the insolvent, she having left the house of her husband. There was a suit in the Consiatory Court for a divorce on the ground of cruelty, but It had not been proceeded with, and on the part of the insolvent the allegation of cruelty was strenuously denied. It appeared that the insolvent had acquired property in Australia, and in January last, before the verdict in the action, he made over all his property, worth upwards of 5,0001., by r. deed of gifb to his father, John Ashley. The question was whether the property was protooted, or whether the assignee should contest the validity of the deed by action. Mr. Commissioner MuripnY, after a discussion on the point, ordered the insolvent to be discharged, leaving tho assignee to contest the deed, a copy of which was required to be furnished to the opposing creditor. The insolvent was accordingly discharged.
THF HAsTINGs BANK FA .um-The liabilities of the bank are stated not to exceed 150,000Z., while the actual note circulation (limited by the Act of 1844 to 38,0381.) is tbought not to be more than about two-thirds of that amount, ramely, 25,0001. Various rumours are afloat as to the probable dividend that may be paid, and 10s., 12s., 15s., and even 20s. In the pound are spoken of. The latter anounts are, however, it is to be feared, hardly to be expected; and, taking into consideration the cost of realizing the assets and securities of a long-established bank, and the unfavourable cofditions under which such realization mtst necessarily now be conducted, it would be unwiso on the part of creditors to indulge in too sanguine an estimate. At the same time, it is but right to state that the parties most compotent to form a judgment on the point speak with hope of a substantial dividend. Under any circumstances, holders ot notes, or creditors in other respects, will do wisely not to enter into precipitate bargains in order to effect an immediate realization. We have given our own version of this painful event, on authority on-whtch we have everyreason to place reliance. But, although itis doubtless entirely true that the stoppage of the bank may be more or less immediately traceable to the lossee sustained through Mr. R. Smith, and to the involvement of two of the partners (his brothers) through the same agency, yet it would certainly seem that had the assets of the bank been compromise4 in no other direction, the involvements of the three brotbers could scarcely be of a magnitude to destroy by their own weight an establishment so firmly fixed and with such extensive and deeply-founded connextons as that in queetion. Tbe natural impression is that the advances made by-the b'ank in other directions must have been tinged by the like insecure character; and when it is remembered for how. extended a period severe distress prevailed among the Lop planters some years since, in consequence of the low prices of agricultural produce, short croDs of corn,, and superabundant growth of hops, entailing a perfectly crushing pressure from the hop duty-we say, when all these points are considered, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the bank was led-if not comparatively forced-into numerous advances, which recent years have failed to wipe off. These advances, coupled with the state of things abve detailed will more satisfactorily account for the failure of the Hastings Bank, than the loss, however heavy, by. two 6iS three individual accounts, albeit the climax may have been occasioned by the latter.-Sussc.x Advertiser of yesterday.

L'LECTION COMMITTEES. 'The General Committee of Elections yesterday nominated the following committees:- OXFOID (CITY).--fr. P. Blackburn, Colonel Gilpn Mr. C.R. B.M. Talbot, Mr. T. Burke; chairmana, Mr. E. C. Egerton. TF)VKESBURY.-Mr. W. E[. Adams, Mr. W. Bulchanan, Lord Haddo, Mr. W. Wyndh&m; chairman, Mr. E. Ellice. BURY.-Mr. F. B. Beamish, Colonel T. Herbert, Mr. C. Howard, Mr. W. F. Knatchbull; chairman, Mr. W. Hutt. CAMBRIDGE (BOROUGI). The committee yesterday morning struck out the name of Mill, the voter whose case was under consideration on Monday, being of opinion that it was governed by the decision in Halsey's case. The scrtiny was then resumed. The vote of Japhet Edwards was objected to on the ground that he had made a claim for the payment of three of his sons as messengers, and had votea under the impression that that claim would be satisfied; and that he had received money in respect of one of his sons who had rendered no adequate services. Evidence was given to the effect that Edwards had complained that he had only got paid for one of his sons, although he had sent in a claim in respect of aU three. The committee decided upon retaining the vote, being of opinion that it did not come within the statute. The cases of voters who were said to have lost their quali. fication by reason of nonresidence was then gone into, and the vote of one Nicholson was struck out, but that of Alfred Lyons was retained. The committee adjourned until tibs day. MAYO (COUNTY). The first witness examined yesterday morning. was William Bellchambers, Colonel Higgins's valet. He said that on Sunday, the 5th of April, he accompanted his master, who was proceeding in a mall phaeton from his aesidence at Giencorrib to Ballinrobe. About half-past 8 in the evening they met a large mob, among whom was Father Conway on horsebaok. There were two cars with the mob. Conway rode up to the carnage and asked,"Whom have we here, bos? It is Hggin" Colonel Hlggins told the postilion to drive on. Conway said, " At him, boys P' Sticks and stones then flew about them, but the postillion drove on as hard as he could, and they made their escape. The Colonel stayed at Mr. Tighe's house while he was at BaDinrobe. The tovn was in a constant state of excitement, and the Colonel had to be guarded the whole time of his stay. On cross-examination the witness said that on the Wed. nesday the town was quiet. He accompanied Colonel Higgins home in the maail phaeton on the Wednesday evening. The Colonel had been in Ireland canvassing for about three weeks before the election. He did not canvrass personally in Ballinrobe. Witness was present at the nomination at Castlebart Mr. Bernard 'Manus, a magistrate of the county of Mayo, a Roman Catholic, and a supporter of Colonel Higgins, stated that on the Sunday before Palm Sunday he attended mass at a village called Bohola, and heard the Rev. Mr. Halligan tell the congregation in English that the Roman Catholic bishops had come to a resolution to oppose Colonel Higgins, as he nad betrayed the people and was unworthy of their confidence, and to support Mr. Palmer. Witness then stood up to speak, but Father alligan and FatherM'Nlcho. las, the parish priest, told the people not to hear him. Hauigan also told the people who had votes to vote for Moore and Palmer, and said to those who had not that they could be of great use. The voters of Colonel Higgins had to be escorted to the poll in consequence of the violence of the mob. During the election he saw several priests engaged in taking the voters of- Moore and Palmer to the polL.On one occasion, notwithstanding the presence of a large escort, some voters -were met by a mob, headed by a bailiff of Mr. Moore and armed with shillelaghs, aid one of thema was carried off. Mr. Moore canvassed at Swin. ford, accompanied by a considerable mob, led by Dix or eight priests. A large number of the Roman Catholio gentry supported Colonel Higgins. On cross-examination3 the witness said that he had been a magistrate for the last 10 years. His name was on the committee formed to support Colonel Higgins, and he had taken an active part in canvassing for that gentleman. There were a company of infantry and a troop of cavalry during the election at Swinford. He had more than once heard priests address their congregations during divine service on other than religious topics, but he had never beard them speak on purely political questions. After Halhgan had spoken witness stood up, and Halligan said he mighbt speak to the people on the stepa outside or anywhere but in the chapeL. Witness then adsessed the people in favour of Colonel HIiggins and against Mr. Palmer, at first inside and then outsido the chapel. He spoke for about five minutes inside and for about two mmnutes outside. His brother had once acted as MWr. Moore's agent, and six or seven years ago he also acted for a short time in thesame capacity. Mr. Strickland had takenup Colonel Higins' voters. Witness had also taken up voters whom he had canvassed. By the CrrAinsrIT.-Two of the magistrates acting In the Swinford district were members of Colonel Higgins's committee. - lavin, a freeholder of the county living at Bohola, also deposed to having heard Father Hall'gan on the Sunday before Palm Sunday te11 the people that Higgins was a pledge-breaker, a traitor to his country, and a Government man; that the bishops and pisota had da.Wrrmnea to oppose him, and that it weoud be a sad day when the people turned against their priests. The witness then corroborated the account given byMr. M'Manus as to what had taken place in the chapel. About a fortnight before the election he saw Mr. M3oore and four or five priests at Swinfotd. At Kellinagh the day before the election he saw Mr. Cogn, a priest, speaking from a publichouse. He called on the electors and the non-electors tovote for Moore and Palmer. (A laugh.) A gentleman named Jordan said that if Colonel Higgins was there he would daub hi8 face with the dirt of his feet, and called on the people to hoot the- Colonel out of the town if he went there, as he was a pledge-breaker and traitor. The people were very wild, hooting and yelling, Father M'Nicholas told witness that if he did not vote fox Moore he would make him sorry and mark him, and called him a scoundrel auda rascal. The witness then described an attack made by a mob of 90 or 100 people upon 13 or 14 cars foil of Higgins's voters. On the 7th of April some of Moore's voters entered his house (he kept a publichouse), and behaved in a violent manner. They called for drink and we gave it " to peacefy them3." (Laughter.) When they t out they made an attack on the house with 8tones, and wife sent for Mr. MhManus's stoward to come with his gun and fire a shot into the air. He did so, and frightened the mob away. On cross-examination the witness said he had heard priests at former elections address their congregations on the sub. ject of the election, but he had never heard a layman inter. rupt a priest while he was so addressing the people. He had supported Colonel Higgins as much as he could-;E every honest man would. (A laugh.) Military were brought out during the election of 1852. u By Sir G. HAN1rER.-He did not hear the priest say that he would refuse absolution to any one who voted for Colone] Higgins. rlhelim Brennan, a voter of Mlaye, stated that Fathbi Richard Prendergast was the curate of his parish. On the Wednesday before the election Father Prendergast came to his house and canvassed him for Moore and Palmer. Wit. ness said he should not liko to vote for them, as his landloid did nob go that way. On the night after, when he was in bed, some people came to him and told him to L with his clergyman or he would suffer for it. Witnd took Up his pitchfork to them and they went away withoit doing im any harm. On the Sunday, after mars, Father Prende;-gast sent for him and some other voters, and again asked him to vote for Moore and Palmer. On that right, after heohad been in bedabout two hours, Father Rchard and another priest, Father James, came to him and took him in a car to Father Richard's house. He was not w',l ig to go on to the car, because he was not very well dressd and because his mind was to vote for Colonel Higgins. He had taken an inch of liquor more than his due (laushter) and theepriasts helped himtup. He sat quiet enough, being between the two clergymen, bat they were singing and rowing for themselves. (Laughter.) They went to Fatber Richard's house, where he got plenty of drink, and was piut to bed by a girl and a boy. (Laughter.) They were very ind to him. They gave him breakfast in the morning, 'id asked him to vote for Moore and Palmer. Witness said he would do as his mnaster pleased, but if his master was niot against it he would like to vote for Mr. Higgins,He' wont vith F&6hur MoharmA and Father James to Swinford, wheir they met other priests. They took him to the solJ against his will. The priests told him that his soul wold be in heB if he voted for Hggins. He then voted toz Moore and Palmer. T there were five or six prnests behind him, and he could not tell which of them used thexp - edon he had stated. It waswhIdspered inhi ear. eXp5 On cross-examination the witness said he had voted for Mooe ad Hggis a th fomerelction. The polling booth was very full at the time he was spoken to about brs soul. He could not say who spoke to him, but it was a Re-examnined.-He had intended to plump for Colope! Mr. Henry Grattan Curran, the son of the celebrated Mr, Curran, said that he was a stipendiary magistrate in Ros. comnmon, but he had charge of the Swinford district In Mayo during thoe election.

He 'fas told, but he did not Aear, that- Mr. Moore added, s'But don't strike." He could not remember whether he nad committed tie men who were afterwards liberated for a rtot or for an assault. He committed them for trial at the petty sessions. A man named Cavanagh was charged with firing at another person, but he discovered the charge was utterly false. Mr:. FioEn b'Lauchlin a farmer, attended chapel at Kil-. rnena, a bishop's parish; where the Rev. Luke RByan was the Roman CatholiE administrator. On- Sunday, the 15th of March, in the cburse of the service, Ryan eaid he had attended one election -meeting, and he was going to attend another, and it had already cost him 31. to defeat the return of that traitor Higgins. On the following Sunday Ryan read from the altar a list 0± all the freeholders in the parish. le commented upon every name, applying sich epithets as"traitor," "black-leg," and "black-sheep" to every one likely to vote for Higgins.. He said Higgins had sold them and his country, and, pointing to the centro of the church,. he added, "If the devil himself came up there I would sooner vote fod him than for Higgins." He struck the altar with his hand as hasaid this. Mr. E. JAs asked what effect this had upon the congregation. Mr. M. SMIIIE objected to evidence being given as to what any of the congregation had told the witness after the conclusion of the service with regard to the impression produced by the words used by the priest. The CoasTrrrE held that the evidence was admissible. Mr. B. ,TAarsM.-aow soon after the service did you hear anything said by the congregation with regard to the denun;. ciation .

The greater part of the sitting yesterday was occupied by ~the speeches of counseL - r. Serjeant PIGoTT sammed up the case of the petitioner, and lfr. TMrPLE replied on behalf the sitting members. Mr.Monoktonll Milnes, M.P., was then examined by Mr. PICsXRG.-He said that having been member for Ponteifract for 20 years, and having heard the address of Mr. James in opening this case, he was desirous of vindicating i the borough of Pontefraot from tho stigma which he had cast upon it of being one of the most venal boroughs in the country. Formerly there used to be a custom in Pontefract, asin cull, Beverley, York, and other-to wos, of paying the "pot! wallopers" head-money after an election, to the amount of two or three guineas each, but there being a doubt as to the legality of this paymentit was abolished by an Act passed in 1842. The idea of the legality of the payment, howeerv, having taken such strong root in the borough, it was difficult I to- 6radicate;and&he himself had been written to on various occasions by" 9otwallopers," demanding from himitEe pay.- ment of the nead-money," andthreatening him with legal proceedings if he didnot pay it. (A laugh.) He had done all in his power to get rid of the practice in the borough. It might require some courage and resolution in the members and candidates to refuse the payment of it, but it might be done away with altogether if members would exercise therequisite amount of courage. It a gentleman came into the borough with the determination of spending a large sum of money, and offered not only the head-money but such sums as 81. and 101. for a vote, it was not in human nature to suppose that a poor voter conld withstandthe temptation. No doubt when contests were close run and high prices were offered for yotes, Pontefract eleetors mi,ht have been guilty of receiving bribes, but the guilt ought to faD on those personA who, coming from a distae, Fith no. con nexion with the borough, lavished large sums in these illegal proceedings; otherwise, he believedPontefract to be as-pure as other oogs hr -was a .great amount of treating in 1852, but thhelast electionad been very quieta On comparing the two elections, he had no doubt that the new Act had effected its purpose in Pontefract at least * Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant PgOery, the hon. gen.

Nothing has come to my knowledge to induce me to believo that there was any money paid for votes at this election. I was told that Mr. Ollveira had given promises, but I do not know anything of my own knowledge. In 1852 Mr. Lewis spent a great deal of money, as well as Mr. Oliveira, and I was told that the large sum paid by Mr. Oliveira for the withdrawal of the petition went to reimburse Mr. Lewis for his expenses. . The committee adjourned until Thursday at 12 o'clock. ROCHDALE. The committee met again this morning. On the application of Mr. Vaughan a warrant was granted to compel the attendance of a material witness, named Levl Lamb. Thomas Scholefield proved that Richard Mills and Thomas She pherd canvassed him for Sir A. Ramsay. Edmund m oUitt, waste dealer, Roohdale, was called to prove the agency of Richard Mills and other persons, but lie answered nearly all the questions put to him in the negative, and no material information was elicited from him. Anthony Morlev. hawker stated that he saw Henes-dt so tk a voter naimed - 'k?sra to the poll. Ho tried to speak to O'Hara, but Henemsey prevented him. RebPeca Illingworth, the wife of a beereller at Rochdale, was examined by Mr. MONK, but all the evidence which: was obtained from her was that Mills on one occasion asked' her for whom her husband was going to vote, and she replied that if he voted at aU it would be for Sir A. isay, Thomas Chadlwick-, a messenger in the employment of Mr. Miall's committee, stated that he saw Richard Mils and Henessey bring Mtartin Daisy and Dominie O'EHara up to the potland booth to vote, and thlt Henessey told him on the of May that he got O'Hara sway unknown to his wife. Robert Chadwick a boatman, stated that, in pursuance of instructions from Abraham Rhodes, he, on the day of the polling, took about 1S men intto Rochdale to keep the passages to the poling booths cear for voters, These men were aid 4s. a-day each, and had their dinners and drink at the ilue Bail.

George Greenwood, smallware dealer, Drake-street, Rochdale, stated that some time before the election Richard Mills canvassed him for Sir A. IRamsay. A man namned William Kershaw was called to prove some. thing which Thoms Bamford had told him as to the source from which he obtained the money with which he defrayed the trip to iAverpool on the day before the poll, when he took a voter named Lord with him.: The evidence having been objected to, the committee decided that it could not be received. Thomas Bamford himself was then caled. He gave substantially the same account of the trip to Bury and Liverpool, as was given by the witnesses on Monday. When asked as to where the money came from with which they defrayed their expenses, he said that Taylor, one of the party, took all the tickets, and they afterwards individually repaid him. Hie now told Kershaw that the money came from-the committee-room. John Asan stated that Joseph Heeley engaged him among othirs to see that Mr. MiaUll's friends did not carry off Sir A.

THE THU2IDgRSTORM. LIVERPOOL, TuEsDAY. A great storm of rain accompanied by vivid flashes 6f forked lightning and loud peals of thunder, broke over this district:un Monday evening. After continuing for about jtwo hours, it ceased until this morning, when it retfed~ Wi-ith re;doubled fury, andconsiderable damage must I have been occasioned, although at present but few cases of injury havebeen reported. Among these two arezemarkable. Some time in the forenoon a dwellinghonse, inhabited 1 by Mr. Kelly, in a row called the Five Elms, at Aig. burth, belonging to Mr. Edgar, was struck by lightning. l Tne fluid passed down the chimney, and partially blew off the roof. of the house, and penetrated to the sitting room, sweeping off and destroying a number of ornaments on the mantelpiece. Fortunately, no one was in the roomn at the time, though Mrs. Kelly had but recently left. About the same time two French horses were standing in a hearse 'within the palissades of the St. James's Cemetery, which lies consnierablv below the level of the road, when a vivid hash of lightningca~usedthem to break from their traces, leaD a hedge skirting the roadway, and precipitate themselves into the groundsbelow, sustaining severeinjuries. Theelectric cloekon the Exchange Dags was stopped-while the storm was in its fury. Between lOand 11o'clock a gentleman of Liverpool was being manied at Walton church. Whilein the act of putting the ring on the lady's finger a flash of lightning appeared to strike the interesting and indispensable gold ornamnent, which the bridegroom dropped, in alarm, upon the loor. It is said to have been quickly picked up by the lady, who, with an encouraging whisper, returned it to her future lord. The ceremony was continued and safely completed.

Magnay, Bart., resigned. Ir Kennard propostd Mr. T. Gabriel to fill thelvacany, and, there beiqg no other candidate, the chairman declared that gentleman to be duly elected. Mr. Gabriel, in returning thanks, sad he was anxious t promote social progress 2nd cominercial improvement.

The poor they were told, according to the highest.authority, would never perish out of tho land; I hey existed as a blessing or a curse-as a blessing if kindly treated and usefully employed; a a curseif left in ignorance and degradation, without those moral and social advantages which, as our fellow-men, thcy were entitled to expect at our hands. - DiNEm To MR. FoRSurT-On Monday a dinner was given at the White Horse Hotel, Leeds, to Mr. W. E. Ferster, who at the last two elections for that borough was a candidate on the Liberal interest, but who, to preserve union among the Liberal party, retired before the dav of election. Mr. J.

Mr. Forster, in returning thanks, touched upon most of t,ho topics of the day, and advocated the principles of religinus and civil liberty. IMPORTANCE OF KNOWWGFRExciL-In this happy country -of ours, where any man maybe anything, xrom President downwards, everybody should knowa little of everything, particularly French, so as to be prepared for an emergency. Several capable men have missed good appoint meants as foreign Ministers because they could not spea ;ny language but their own. A knowledge might be the means of securing an embassy, perhaps to France, where a smattering of the language will be found extremely convenient to an ambassador. Our preserit representative to the Emperor of- France labours under the disadvantzge of not being able to speak the language of the country; but fortunately for us the Emperor can speak English, Eo that our Mfiniste can have intercourse with him without the aid of an interpreter. But all Frenchmen cannot speak English, and Horace Vernet, the great battle painter, is one of them. We are likely, it seems, according to a correspondent of the Providence Journae, to be deprived of the services of the great. French artist in decorating our national capitol because he does not understand English, and our Ministr cannot speak French. Mr. Mason, it is said, received instructions to make an offer to Vernet. and sent for him to communicate the intelligence to him. The Minister read the despatch to the artist, who could not understand a word of it; and when some one asked him whether he intended going to America, he replied that he did not know he had *--een invited. - Perhaps some friend has been found bewore I his to act as an interDreter between the Minister and the rrtist, and the Frencliman wiU havelearnt the honour that has been paid him-NeTw York Times.

JIM. CA1RILES DICKZENS'S "READING." Thesecondentertainment "inremernbrance"of. thelate Mr. Douglas Jerrold took place last might at St. Marti s. hall. where 3Mr. Charles Dickens read his own Christmos Carol fsr the first time before i London public. The fame of his meiits as a "reader," and of the enthusiasm that they had created inthe maunfacturing towns, had long reaehed this metropolis, and at an early hour the hall wa, crammed with an audience anxious to become acquainted with the most popular of living authors in a new capaoity. Indeed, so large was the number sent away from the doors, through want of Toomn, that long before the-assembly had dispersed placards were affixed in various parts of the building by the "Jerrold comittee" announcing a repetition of the "reading" at the same place on Friday, the 24th inst. The reports respecting Mr. Dickens's command over an audience have not been in the least exaggerated. It is no such easy matter to read for upwards of two hours a book with which the 3isteners are acquainted, and to keep them all the while in a state of breathless inte. zest; but this is actually done by Mr. Dickens. He does not, indeed, impersonate the various charaoters of his tale, except in the single case of the Miser Scrooge, whose words he speaks in seoile accents. All that is spoken by the other characters he delivers, like the narrative, in his own natural voiee. But, though he does not act the personages, heoompletely enters into the spirit of the situations, and the joviality with which he describes the scenes of Christmas festivity endows his discourse with the vividness of a living picture. To transform him; self into a number of successive individuals he does :not attempt, but he throws himself into the atmosphere in which they all move, and compels his audience to live' In it likewise. With his pathetic scenes he ismore cautious than with his mirth. He would evidently avoid all imputation of maudlin sentimentality, and where he would eUcit the tears of his audienoe he trusts to a manly, unaffected tone in the descrIption of sorrow. But his command is equaly potent over emotions of every kdnd, and during the hole of last evening he held the sympathies of his hearers as firmly as one might grasp a tangible object. The very aspect of that crowd, comaposed of the most various classes, hanging on the utterance of one man, was in itself an imposing spectacle. The deafening acclmations which followed the conclusion of the " reading," and compelled Mr. Dickens to come forward once more upon the platform, might, of course, be traced to the popularitylof the writer as well as to the merits of the " reader b" hut, at all events, it was a noble tribute to one who has always used his pen for the interests of the masses, and who had just recreated them by enlivening with his own voice one of the mosbt favourite products of his fancy. To many occupants of the shilling seats Charles Dickens was familiar as a friendly name, and they were delighted to see him a visible reality. The third of the "Jerrold" entertainments will consist of Mr.W. H. Russell's narrative of the Crimean War, to be delivered at St. Martin's-hall on Tuesday the 7th.

TFzEINDINRFMFoltcs3rz Ts.-Theo public hardly requires to be informed that no time has been lost in taking adequate stees to provide for the unfortunate condition of affairs in the Bengal army. The official despatches were delivered only yesterday morning, and in the course of the afternoon thera was a meeting of Cabinet Ministers. A lengthened consultation of the Directors of the East India Company also took place, and before the announcemaent upon the subject had been made in Parliament last evening the telegraph was actively at work in different directions. Fortunately, before the arrival of the last two or three malls from India a considerable body of Her Majesty's troops were under orders for embarcation. As long ago as. December lat four infantry regiments-the 23d, 82d, 90th, and 93d-were placed under orders to relieve two regiments -the 10th and 29th-whose term of service had been completed, and to fiU up the deficiency in the Indian establishment caused by the return to this country of two more regiments during the Crimean wa, which reduced the number. of Queen's infantry corps in the Presidcencies from 21 to 22. The events at Horgkong, however, rendered it necessary to change the immediate destination of the four regiments we have samed from India to China, it being intended that as soon. as their work in the latter regton had been completed they should return to India for the tour of daty for which they had been originally designated. But, as soon as our accounts from China became of a graver character it was determined not to leave the Indian army without reinforcements for the uncertain time during which the Chinese hostilities might continue; and, in consequence, four more regiments of infantry were placed under orders to take the duty allotted to those now on their way to China. Accordingly, some weeks since the 7thFnsileers, 60th Rifles (3d battalion), 88th Regiment, and Ride Brigade (3d battalion), were warned for service in India. At the same time the 2d and 3d Regirnents of Dragoon Guards were detailed to relieve two other cavalry corps-the 14th Light Dragoons and 9th Lancers, who, having been out since 1841 or 1842, ought to be relleved about this time. All these regiments have received their increased establishment, and ships are ready for their oonveyance to the East. At this season large draughts are usually sent from the depot at Chstham to all the Indian regiments, for the purpose of keeping up their strength to the ful establishment. These draughts will this year amount altesether to about 3,000 men, averaginag from about 70 or 8u to 2a0 to each reelment. The forca, therefore, which will commence emibowr6. ing to-morrovv morning may be thus estimated:- h Dragoon Guards . 70 7th F'nsifeers a0a 68thl Rifles (3dBasttaon) 1,'ee 88h Regiment. Rifle Brigado S3d Battalion) 1.880 Draughts-about.. 3,0 8480 If we add the 64th and 78th Regiments, which have before this arrived at Calcutta, we shall have already, we may say, on their way a force of 10,000 men. Yesterday evening, holwever, there were also placed under orders the lit Battaion of the lst Royals at DabEn, the 19th Regimeut at Portsmouth, the 38th Regiment at the Curragh, and the 79th. Hlghlanders at Dublin, making altogether an addational force of 4,000 men, or a total augmentation of the European troops in India of 14,000 men, Aportion of this, force is, strictly speaking, destined to relieve regimdnts whose period of service has expired but those regiments will be kept at hand until all occason for their services shall have ceased, and thus every man golng out is an actual addition to the Indian army. We may add that all offieMrs in the Company s service now on leave are ordered immediately to rejoin their regiments, the only exceptions being those whose health actually icapacitates them from service in India. It wil thus be seen that the measures taken by the Government at home to reinforce General Anson are as prompt and vigorous as could be wlshed,-Globe.

A Wharndliffe meeting of this company was held on Friday, at Shrewsbury, to considertwoeBills before Parliament, one for the conversion of the Shropshire Canal into a rail. way, and the other for the makhng of a railway from Ceresi (nearNewtown) to fachynlfeth. 3ar. H TootX 4 presided. 'he CnAInRHAI- stated that the canal was about eight miles in length, and passed through the Shropehire iron dis. trict. It was in a bad state of repair, and badly su;plied with water. It would cost about 30,0001. to put the can into repair, and the estimated cost of converting it Into a railway was 80,0001. The'LondonandNorth-Western Company would pay the cost of the conversion and of obtaining the act of Parliament, and the Shropshire Union shareholders would not be called upon to pay anything. The Newtown and Machynlleth Railway Bill merely provided for working arrangements between the two companmes. On the motion of the CHA=vrA.,I, resolutions approving the two Bills were unnimously passed. ST. ANDREW'S AND QUEBEC. A special meeting of the Class A shareholders of thiscom. pany was held yesterday at the London Tavern to consider a Bill now before Parliament, n comp liance with the standing orders of the House of Lords; Mr. F. Edwards in the chair. The-CHAr=nAr explained that the object of theBill wan to confirm an arrangement which had been entered into between the Class A shareholders of the St. Andrew's and Quebec Railway and the New Brunswick and Canada Rail.' way and Land Company. The deed of- transfer was sanc-. tioned at a general meeting of the shareholders on the 20th of September last, and:the seal of the company had--been afxed thereto. The deedpurportedto convey the whole ofthe property of the Class A shareholders to the New Brunswick and Cenada Company in exchange for shares at par in that company. Tee class A Ehareholders, in the event of the undertakmng being carried out, had agreed to do what was necessary to confirm the arrangement. Tho matter had been fully discussed at two or three special meetings of the company, and a very large majority decided on lng their interest to the New BunswickCompany. The holders of aboat 6,000 out of S,000 shares in thecompany had assented to the transfer Qf their property to the new company; and all that wa3 required of them now was to give their sanction to the Bill, which would confirm that transfer. Mr. Baxter, the solicitor, read the preamb'le andheads of the Bill, which clearlv explained the whole transaction from the original formation of the company, in 186, to the present time. The St. Andrew's and Quebec Company consisted of two classes of shareholders, Class A and Class B. Tha Class A shareholders had subscribed and paid up 80,0001., and were to have a certaim guarantee of interest when the line was completed; but the St. Andrew's Company having failed to do so, other arrazgements had to be made with a view to save the property. The New Bruns. wick and Canada Railway and Land Company (imited) was formed with a nominal capital of 800,0001.. in201. shares, to complete the line to Woodstock. On the 2th of September, 1856, the majority of the St. Andrew's and Quebec Company assented to a deed purporting to be a transfer of their pro. perty to the new comrpany, and the transaction was assented to by the Governor of New Brunswick. The Bill provided' for the confirmation of the transfer, and stipulated that the property of the St. Andrew's and-Quebec Company should be vested in the New Brunswick and CanadaRailwayand Izudl Company. The rights of the Class A shareholders, the Government of New Brusnwick, and others were preserved in the Bill. The. CAMMN moved a formal resolution approving the Bil. Mr. BATES seconded the motion, and in doing so complained of the course adopted by Mr. Sharpe, one of the directors of the St. Andrew's Company, in sending state. roents to the shareholders with respect to their property which were not in accordance with the facts of the case. He contended that the terms of the agreement were fair and equitable, and that it -was most unfair for a few share. holders to turn round on those who had saved the property and endeavour to upset the agreement. It was unfortunate that the interests of Mlr. Sharpe were not identieal with those of the other shareholders, and that he should continue to oppose the Bill Mr. GooDnCu} had repeatedly protested against his interest in the St. Andrew's and Quebec being transferred to a new company. He complained that, although he had been appointed auditor in February, 1856, he had been refused access to the books andaccounts. He vwntedto see what they had done vith the money. The CHARniAn said that since Mr. Goodehap had been appointed auditor the company had neither :eceived nor expended one shilling. ^After some observations from Mtlr. SHAkin defence of the course he pursued, it WaS stated that a committee of shareholders had examined the accounts fromthe commencement, and that Mr. Goodehap must have hada copy of them in his possession for some days past. The resolution approving the Bill was then put and carried, but there being a few dissentients a po1l -was necessary in order to ascertain whether three-fourths of the paid-up capital of the company represented at the meeting were in favour of the Bill. On the votes being taken there appeared 2,770 shares, representing 50,4001., in favour of the iBill, and 781 shares, representing 156201, againStit; the approval of the B1Ill wvas therefore confirmed. A& vote of thanks to the chairmnan concluded the proceedings. NEW BRUNSWICK AND CANADA. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern; Sir H. MAuggeridge in the chair. The report stated that the worls were now being vigorously proceeded with. The directors have been much gratified to find that the anticipations held out in the pro. spectus as to the favourable character of the line for cheap constraction have been fuUy borne out. Other rail-ways in INeew Brunswick are now being vigorously proceeded with. The line from Shediac to St. John's when finished must be. come an important feeder to the line. So soonas the Bill receives the Royal assent it is the intention of the directors to organize a land compsny. When the ralway is com. pleted there ir every reason to expect that thelandawil 'eommafand a price equal to that which is now bdng realized for suiilar land in Canada. The amournt realized from the deposit of 21gper share-viz., 21,498&,,together with the 18, 00L due from the provicial Governmnent, will be more than sufficlent to pay for the constraction of the line to the 40th mile, inc uding a supply ofrolling stock. Twenty miles further are under contrct, and it is expected that a total length of 60 miles from St. Andrew'swillbe completed by the end of the-year. The capital account to May 31 showed that 23,1981. had been received, and 14,4501. expended, leaving a balance of 8,7471. The CHAIrnLV, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the New Brunswick Government. were now sending forward the 18,000. of debcentures due to the company, whch wouldenable them to complete the line to thie 40th mile, without delay, probably in a few w eek;s. Their manager expected to be able to open the line to the 60th mile nextspring, and to Woodstock by the end of 1858 He (the Chairman) believed that no shareholder in any thrriwycompay would have more contingeut advan. tagesthian those in their company, and he congratulated them on their prospects. Me had no doubt that all the anticipated results of their undertaking would be realized, Resolutions were passed adopting the report, re-electing the retiring directors, and appointing MIr. lowden andfr. Harvey auditors. Mr. BATEs remarked it s an extraordinary thing that their railway to the 40th mile would only cost them at the rate of 2,0001. per mile. It was stated that a 21. call would be made in the course of three months, and that calls would not be made oftener than once in three months. The proceedings concluded with a vote of than.ks to the chairman and directors. STOCKPORT, DISLEY, AND WHLEY-BRIDGE. A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at the omce, Leadenhall-street, Mr. J. Chapman in the chair. The solicitor read the heads of "A BiU to empower the Stockport, Disley, and lVhaley.bridge Railway Company to extend their railway to Buxton, and for other purposes con. ected with their undertaldng." On the motior. of the CHAinin&x, a formal resolution approving the Bill was adopted, The meetino then separated. CANNOCK MIERAL. At a special meeting of this cornp any, held yesterday at the offices, 27, Great George-street, Westmnins>ter,Mtr Ilalins in the chair, a Bill was approved, in compliance with the standing orders of the Hfouse of Lords, for extending the time for the completion of the Cannock Mineral Railway.
