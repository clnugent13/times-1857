STBEET NOISES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Thousands wiUl doubtless join with me in thanking you for your able article in this day:s Tim upon the above subject. I am not so fortunate as to be a Belgravian, but, as the nuisance is metropolitan, I trust you will allow me, though only a poor suburban, to add my mits to a complaint which I hope will ere long become universaL Being obliged to vegetate for six days of the week in the city, I fondly hoped that by having a residence about Ealf-an-houes walk on the Surrey side of thc bridges should be able to luxuriate in peace and quietness on tho seventh; bat, alas! instead of so doing, I am tortured and my attention taken from better things by a constant succes- on of discordant eries. Between 6 and 7 in the morning, when an extra nap would be a real luxury to a hard-worked a man, I am made painfully sensible of the impossibility of getting it by "Milk 0, below;" then come "W Wateroresses V" followed by "Red Herrings," or "Real Bloaters," "Newspapers,"&c.;in fact,the gamae Is kept uptil church timoe,when two hours respite may be enjoyed according to Act of Parlia- ment, but the moment the olock strikes "one" then we have ! " Beer O's' from all the pnblios within a quarter of a mile. This has to be endured till we have disposed of our roast mutton, &c., then the greatest noise of all begins-yiz"Walnuts !" produced bya set of idle-looldng costermongers, who seem to delight in keeping two or three on each side of the street, and bawling two together as loud as they can. This continues til dusk; in the meantime we have had " Crunpets and Muffins !" " WaUercresses," "Milk O," and " Bloaters" again. I do think that these annoyances may be considerably lessened without inconvenience to the public; and I hope, Sir, that Parliament may be induced either to extend the powers of the Police Act or to pas a Street Noise Suppression Act. I arn, Sir, your verv obedient serva.nt, ACA,TOR. Walwortb, Noy, I&3
OXFORD AZYD EDINBURGH.-AN ACADEMICAL CONTAAS2. (rom the &Supfflemnt to the ~Daily &ots-ma,n) Yesterda y afternaoon at 3 o'clock Professor Blackle Commnenced te winter sessiozn in the University by the deliver; of the followiuog initroductory lecture : " I have determined in the present lecturelto set forth in systematic contrasts the penuliarities of the Oxonian and the Edinburgh systeam of education, in order that, while Oxford has for soine years past been busily emaployed in bauiding UP her weak points, we in Scotland may be aroused to a more Ivivia perception of whst It is our duty to do for outr 'Universities i this age of trausition and progress. Thoso who still choose to indulge theruselves in the pleasant occupation of contemplating outr academicalI excellencies, real or imagi. nary, mnay do so. I have a more serious business ont basnd, and so long as 1 see the most glaring defects and the most unmitigated absurdities tolerated in our existing University system shall consider it my duty on every suitable occasion to stand forward and denounace themn, that both may own usefulness may no longer be marrd, antd the intellectual character of the nationx no longer degraded by the continuance of puerile practices In our highest seats of learning, 'which only the most besotted ignaorance can defend, and nothing but the most culpable laziness can tolerate. "I will present a contrast of the Edinburgh and Oxford systems under six heads: :-The Students -1 the Subjects of Study; the Method of S tudy ; the Disciplue - the Academical Constitution and Government; ana the ~ncouragge. ments and Rewards of ScholarshLip. And though it must be my main object as a practical man to state the strong points of the Oxonian system (whichx are alwasy our Scottish vreak points) wlth more decided prominence, In order that I may stir up the frienas of educational imsprovement in this country, I shall by no means either conceal the defects of our southern frien4s or throw an unpatriotie shade over the manifest virtues of our native institutions. Truth, and truth only, buLt truth for an iamnediate practical purpose, Is what I am at. "1, With regard to the population of the northern and southern Universities there are two points of contrast to be stated, In our Faculty of Arts, which corresponds to the Oxford and Cambridge general curriculum, the Scottish students are la great proportion boys, while the English students are all -young men Of this the most striking proof is that~ Scottis young maen regularly, after spending five or six yeurs at the Edinburghi Academay, are draughted off to Glasgow by the attraction of the Snell bursmaies, and thence in due c-ourse transferred to Balliol College, Oxford, where they are not foundl to be too far advanced or too old for the general average of English students. Again, the young Oxonians are drawn chiefly, though not exclusively, from the upper and middle classes of society ; the Scottish students chiefly, though not exclusively, from the mniddlle and lowest classes of society. In ouar classes the sprinkling of what one might call "1gentry" isalways small while aristocracy seldom or never shows Its face. Now, there canL be no doubt that the first of these points-viz., the admisson of maere boys to the highest seats of learning in the country-is an abuse of the grosszest kind, which ought not to be tolerated, an abase which is subversive of the very idea of a University, and which has practically tended to sinik the character of Scotland for academiceal learning tu a grade lower than that which, so long as the forms of scholarshi1p are maintainted, It could not be very easy to fail. On the other hand, the English were guilty of a great wvrong when, inL contradiction to the express words of their own foundation charters, they constructed their whole academaical sytem in such a manner as to exclude the very persons-namely, the poor-for whose benefit thes foundations were initended. But I ara happy to inform you that in recent times a very strong disposition among all partieo in Oxford has manifested itself to re-tie the brokean bond whichL originally united the middle and lower classesto the Universities; and Ishould only wish ifi Ioould to congratulate a Scottish audience on any similar exhibition of zealon our part toreconsUtitte the llnkwhlch originally bound our Universities to the upper classe of the country,. It is a mnost impertinent and short-sighted Idea which some people in scotlsan seem to entertain, that Universities ought to be regulated mainly for the sons of the poorest classes. They ought certainly to be so regulated that the poorest students wil have no difficulty in boing &dmltt-ed to them, provided they possess the requisite talents and attainments ; but they ought not to be so regulated as to keep open doors for all sorts of crude, stupid, and ill-prepared schoolboys, with whose elementary dril the leared professor is occupied to the nxeglect of his proper academicalfunctions. The mniddle classes, certainly, and the rich, have as gret a claim on the Universities as the poor. This was stated with great effect b thDoax ofFaculty in his most admirable rectorial barehs ean oferdeen; and what I call on the Scottish people to do in reference to this matter Is, that while they continue every fair encouxragement to the talented ions of the poor, they should beware of asUowiug their profesors to dole out rations of meagre soup' by way of charity, which the sions of the rich will despise, and which mnust have the effect of cauingouracdemic halls to be daeserted by the most cultiatd clse of the country, We maust manage matters so that no young man of enterprise and talent, whether rich or poor, shall have occason to go to Oxford or to Berlini because in the metropolis of Scotlad he cannot find teachers who have both time and talent to carry him onito the moot akdvancedl heights of his par-ticular study. "12. With regard to the Sutbjects of Study.-In Oxford, as is well knowin, while professional studIies are almost wholly excluded-a peculiarity the absurdity of which has beeni well set forth by Mr. Kirkpatrick In his 1ate very learned andl valuable book on Unlversities,-the main subject of general study has long been classical philology; and, though certain relaxations have been recently intreduuced into%the hereditary strictne-ss of this routine, it Is undeniable that classius are still the great staple of the place, anid receive by far the greatest amount of the most substantia encouragemnent, while in Sicotland they "ar allowed to take their p lace with other things and find their proper level, as individual inclination or vulgar interestmay determine. At first sight the Scottish may appear the better me'thod-certainly the mLore just ; andl so pernapsItU miht be, ifonytohig existed mn Scotland which are inipesbl nl w thig of classial studies-a good school preparation, a utn tia rewards at the end of the academical course. But thes things notoriously do not exist; and so, when the results of the Scottish system as respects classics are set aLgainst the English, we find that, while the Oxford exclusive systemn has produced a long series of profound theologins eact phiiologers, and highly cultivated gentlemen, the Scottish ateisc-fairs system has produced none at all, This may he a useful fact for those shallow would-be philosophers whio think that Greek and Latin can be brought into the market of the world exactly oni the same principle and with the same prospects as boots and shoe. But there are other things to be noted. The long neglect of classcal learninig in theo Scottish universities has generated a habit of thought, natural enougha to mere money-making men, thakt Greek and Latin are of no use, and the Scottish Universit ies ar precisely for this reason entitled to take their stand far above thellnglish, because they produce no scholars-a terinwhich in the minds of these objectors is synonymous with a pedant, a gerund-grinder, anid a book-worm, Now, to these persons I readily grant that the study of Greek, as it has generally been conductedl in Scotland, is of very little use; I grant, also, that somle persons who have spent some five, or six, or seven ytars of the beat part of thegif~e in pretending to learn L tin and Greek might in many ways have been more profitably employed; but, with all this concession, the fact remains indisputable, in theo words of the great Niebhulr, that ' the road to the highest intellectua culture leads through antiquity.' Philosophy, history, and theology are all based on Greek ; and the most recent phenomena of our Scottish culture show this most distinctly. In philosophy, Sir Williram Hamilton. as being the only thoroughly erudlite thinker, was also the first and only Scottish Professor of Metaphysics who gave to that science the broad historical basis and the grand cosmopolitan survey, the want of which in Scotland has always been so apparent; andl Sir William Hamnilton was educated in Oxford. Then, with regard to history and theology, we are forced to conifess with shame liud confuision of fwac that, exceopt ini the single department of local and native history, which receives effective suipport from some mnembers of the Faculty of Advocates, all historical research has died out in Scotland. In fact, without philology, many of the most difficult problems of historical research are inipossible; and the same thing maust be said of theology. scotland produces, no doubt, effective popular preachers, who in their way may vie with any pulpit orators in Burope; but there is in our Church everywhere felt a woeful lack- of historical knowledge, and, what springs out of that, philosophical survey, No pious thinker, harassed with relilgious douibts, the solution of which lies in the deeper region of historical research and philological crititism, will apply to a Scottish divine ; anid al this intellectual degradation of our nationial Church, when traced to its proper roots, as Dr. Chalmers saw and said 40 years ago, proceeds fromn the fact that we do not teach philology thoroughly In our schools and Universities, but occupy our professrs -with thke vain show of scattering learned seed, which, as matters are arranged in Scotlanid, n3ever can produce fruit. But I have another very important remark to make ina this place, The Oxonlans, who so long stupidlly neglected the natural sciences, are now beginning to give some effective encouragement to that important department. They have built a magnificent Museum of Natural Science, at an expense of some 60,0001. ; they have set apart, at the instance of Profesor Dauabeny, in Magdalene College, a considerable number of fellowships exclusively for the proficients in natural science. In this, manifestly, they are fortifying their weakest point. Let us take an examaple. ur weakest point, unquestionably, isscholarship, Let es build up that. There is no difficalty how to do it, if those who wish to appear dignified Gamaliels wonld only consider that dignity does not always consist in sitting with broad bottom upon an easy chair; and if those who pride themselves in the designation 'practical people' would employ their shreswd optics sometimes on things that do not lie immediately before their nose. "3. As to the Method of Study.-On this subject I couli say a great deal, having, during a recent stay of sonie weeks in Oxford, made it my business particularly to inquire into the details of the so-caUled tutorial system, which is the characteristic educational method in England, as opposed to the professorial which gives a character to the Scotch and German Universities. I will only say, however, for the present, that all that I have seen and observed of this matter tends to confirm the d priori conclusion which a reflective man will naturally come to-viz., that neither the tutorial system alone, nor the professorial alone, will, in the general case, pyoduce zeally efficient teaching; but that the co-operation of both elements is essential. For, while the tutorial system alone, as the evidence in the Oxonian bluebook amply proves, is apt to degenerate into a dull and u,inspired roetmo, the professoria system is in no less daneor of contenting itself with applying a mere passing stim ns and superficial top-dressing. SD far as Iy observation wrent, the Oxonians, oven under tho action of their new Reform Bill, are very far from having attainedl any jest practical conception of the importance of the professorial element in academic edu-cation. There aLre a great many pesa in that qutarter whao labour iu3de the delusive notion thtaprofessor, as distinguisb',fl from a tutor, is a mere flash rhetoricialn-a sort Of Greek sophist, without the vagabondl habits whieb diWisnguished that class in ancient times; san not a small nr-,mber, from this or other motives, are still obstinately dotexiniiied to have as few prefessors as possible in Oxi0 , n- i to give these few as little to do as possible. So lasg as t nis perverse notion prevaUs, a thorough roform of A?-td-sniental defects of the English .ystem is imposaible. This Gladstone should have known. Scotland stands in exactly the reverse, perhaps in a less hopeful situation. For while Oxford labours under a superfluity of teaching _power, most ineffiol6ntly employed, and often not eMployed at all, Scotland, with one professor, as the only teacher of one brancb, in each University,- without-coinpetition and without help, can only make a show of doi'g work in many cases, where the reality is not curiously inquired into. In the larger classes of our metropolitan Universities where there is no tutorial aid there mustVas certainly be bad teaching as there will be bad attendance in a large hotel where there is only a landlord and no waiter; or in a large army where there is only one general.iDnchief, who is expected to form the strategic schemne of a comprehensive campaign, and do the work of halfadozen drillserget besides. The plain remedy for this is to increase our teaching staff, and classify our students; give us tutors, one or two to all our large clases; give us new professorships where they are required; andsubdivide professorships where the accumulated materlal-_s in the case of natural history-is too bulky for the cont*ol of one man. Al thms, of course, cannot be done without money; but there is, as we sid already, no lackof money in the country. There is a want of intelligenco only, and of a lofty purpose. Many are altogether ignorant about the state of our Universities; many are indiferent; others are fuU of that vain conceit and windy delusion which our insular habits and our situation in a oorner Pf Enrope ave so apt to generate. BQt the mist Is now beinM blown away; and when half-a-dozen men of weight and position shall begin to see as clearly in this matter s the present Rector of King's College, we shall not be far from the day vwhen the Scottish University system, with all its imperfections, will be on the fair way to outstrip the Oxonlan. For we shall always, I hope, maintain our superiority to them in one point; we have more liberty, more independence, more nature, more freshness; and another point also is certain, that when we do get tutors we shall know how to use them, and to fit them into our professorial system, in a manner precisely the reverse of the backw&rdnoss to put Into play the natural complement of their tutorial system, displayed by the learned square-caps upon the banks of the Isis. For our commanders-inchblef are at all events awake, and have not their hands tied; and there is always hope in this. " 4. With rceard to Discipline, a single word will suffice. As a whole, unquestionably the English discipliae is far more complate and more effective than ours In Edinburgh we are in many points, even as oomnpared with the other Universities of Scotland, almost perfectlylazwless; nevertheless, under the peculiarly favourable moral circum. stances of this country, so far as character and principle are concerned, I do not think that we have suffered any loss from the want of that more strict system of control which is so much lauded by the Oxford University authorities. As for mere social Impulses and feelingsby no means to be disregarded-there can be no donbt tnat the English system of living in community possesses certain great advantages of which our Edinburgh students are ntterly dprived; but, ander present circumstances, I see no immediste prospect of organizing anything like the English Collage life in our Universities nor do I think that the institution of anything of this lind can seriously be numbered among the most urgent points of academic reform in this part of the Island. " 5. With regard to Constitution and Form of Government, the Oxford men have unquestiontbly in the late Reform Bill made a most marvellous step in advance, of which the consequences are not calcnbable. There exists now, instead of the old oligazchy of the Heads (that is, high dignitaries, the governors of academical boarding. soools), a regular Usnivers.ey House of Commons, m which matters of general educational interest are publicly debated. That this is a good thing, and an element of academic life in perfect accordance both with the oHeinal constitution of the Universities and with the spirit of the British Constitutlon, there can be no doubt. In Scotland, on the other hand, we have perfectly lost sight of the popular principle -which lay at the bottom of our Universitv constitution. Our academical citizens, in fact, have no privileges- and why should they care for asserting a status which has no substantial rights, and which creates no interests? The consequence has been what we see-thatthe Scottish Universities are bodies, for all governmental purposes, consisting only of the close corporations of the proPessors. Nor will it ever be otherwise till the graduates, by bequeathment or legislation, be put in possession of rights in connexion with the Universities which they will thinak it worth their while to assert. The peculiar constitution of the University of Edinburgh-au anomaly in Scotland as in Europe-has introduced into the government of that Institution a certain popular check or democratic control which. has not been without beneficial effects; but whatever the virtues of this anomalous constitution may be-and I believe it has not been without virtue as a means of bringing public opinion to bear on academical life-it certainly has no tendency to nourish an ciprit dc corps among the graduates,-and foster the sense of academia self-respect. Whether the present constitution of the Oxford House of Congregation is free enough from the old tutorial element to allow to the recently sownseeds of reform afair field of development, time only can prove; but with regard to Scotland, we may certanly sEay that the present constitution is utterly inadequate to cherish the feeling of corporat3 dignity in a widely-scattered body ; and that so soon as tho Scottish graduates shall have any rights worth claiming they wil require to invent somo new machinery for assertin and maintaining them. At present the gradaates of a Scottish University have little more bond of cohesion than belongs to any troop of girls i a boarding-sohool and one grand cause of this, as of many other defects an our Scottish system, is to be found In the want of what belongs to our lat point of comparison, viz. : " 6. Encouragements and Rewards to Scholarship.- ere the contrast between Oxford and Edinburgh comes forth in the fullest proportions. In Oxford they have more resources for the encouragement of learning than they know hew to use; in Edinburgh wehave none at all. In Englasid the rewards for learuning are almost too many and too easy; in Scotland the idea of a reward for intellectual attainment, except among a few schoolboys in the shape of paltry bursaries, is absolutely unknown. No doubt, in the highest sense, learning, when really achieved, is always its own reward; but as a matter of practical experience it never is achieved, and never can be achieved, in a country wbere both the starting-point and the goal of a learned life are starvr.tion or banishment. The only rewards for intellectual excellence in Scotland are the professorships; and they are few, and with a few exceptions ill paid. I, the Church, the natural ally of the Univerbity, there are none ; in the schools there are not more than two situations in the whole country which a gentleman of very moderate ambition would condescend to take; only a few places in the profession of the law of ease and dignity are to be found, which places, however, are more often given to busy politicians, to dexterous men of business, and to needy landed proprietors, than to men distinguished for bigh attainments in learning and philosophy. The consequence is that, whereas in Oxford there is a want of the principle of free competition and of high ambition among academic men, there is in Scotland nothing that deserves the name of academical life at all; no Iisure for profound study and thinking even within the waUs of the Universities in many cases; certainly none without. In England scholarship may be oftentimes too trim and formal, sometimes altogether mouldy and stagnantt; but in Scotland the flame of youthful intellectual ambition is systematically blown out and extinguished at the very moment when it most requires to ba fanned. This will never do, This is the system that, in the midst of much talk about our parochial schools, Universities suited to the genius of the people, and so forth, has brought Scotland to such a pass that except in the one department of medical science, which is based uoon a practical and utilitarian interest, and some branches of physical science bearing on the interests of practical life, with the happy accident here and there of a distinguished man, our Universities are hardly known in the wide repubhc of Europan research, and mnst as3uredly sink more and more into contempt, unless we speedily change our system and adopt a principle the very reverse of that which has hitherto guided us in these matters. We must have fellowships; we must have new professorships to represent neglected branches of learning and to cultivate more completely those that exist. Let us encourage learning as we encourage lawyers, and we shall soon see that Scutland possesses men able to rival both the exact erudition of England and the profound speculation of Germany. There is no want of working power among us; but even Scotsmen, whose brains are as hard as reapers' loins, cannot afford to study and to starve at the same time. Bnt unless this change take place, and that with quick decislon, I must confess I see no hope of Scotland being able to regaia the ground in the intellectual world which she has lost. Already, with open fellowvships and increased scholdrships in Oxford, the tide of intellectual ambition in our young men flows more and more besouth the Tweed, and every day pungent proofs are brought beforo the observant eye that Scotland has already inflicted a deep, and it may be an incurable, wound upon herscli bflneglectlng to work out thes complete educational scheme three centuries ago promulgated by her great prophet, John Knox, and volunltarily surrendering to a foreign people and to a strang,e system the highest education of ber noble3 sons.

LONDON, WEDNRSDAY, NOVEXABER 1, 1857. Our Transatlantic neighbours take the convulsion of their money-mnaket with their accustomed coolness. Their trade is for the time, indeed, almost dead. Could people, upon the failure of a circulating medium, faU back immediately upon the original principle of commerce-exchange in kind -this need not be the result; for why should not a snuff-box procure a pair of boots, a pound of coffee a beefsteak ? Why should not cutlery and carpeting, hosiery and cattle, grain and broadcloth, timber and glass and earthenware, come to an understanding with each other.? Why should not the different profesions and trades accommodate each other upon the basis of some honest natural bargain without the aid of artifice, and painting and architecture, arithmetic and dancing, law and medicine, foreign languages and jewelry, millinery and the accomplishments, the classics and old china, come to a mutual arrangement ? But as people cannot fall back at once frora an artificial medium upon a natural one, the failure of the former is the cessation of exchange; it is tantamolnt to a tremendous chasm over which nothing can leap, so that every I article and material is obliged to stay on its own side of the bank. " The grain still "stays in the West ;" "there are no freights to "be carried on any terms, and the boats are lying, "more than a mile of smokeless funnels, idle at "the quays of St. Louis." But in the midst of I this avwful standstill the American mind continues cool, and nothing disturbs its self-possession. The whole affair is taken as an inconvenience-a very great inconvenience, like the loss of your carpetbag, but not as ruin, and hardly as adversity. The bank "cashes under protest;" the railway "concludes to pass its dividends" -i.e., not to pay the shareholders a farthing. The " policy of " suspension" is " declared" throughout the Union. This coolness is, when we examine it, the result of a constant atmosphere of risk, in which the American tradesman, even in quiet times, lives. His ordinary system is pitched to a higher point in the scale of risk than that of the European is. This is one of the remarkable disclosures in which the present panic has resulted; it has brought this fact-familiar enough to the world of trade and the well-informedworld-prominently forward, and put it before the eye of the whole public; so that perhaps this commercial crisis, heavy as it is, is not so important to the spectator on its own account as on account of the ordinary state of things which it has brought to light. The uncontrolled issue of local paper money in the United States has given to the whole medium of exchange the same uncertainty which corrupt coinage gave to the European medium in the middle ages. A man who sells an article in a shop literally does not know what the| thing called money which he receives in exchange! for it is worth. A bit of paper is handed to him, he looks at it, it is a note iEsued by the " Incorporated Butchers" or " Bootmakers," he turns it over, holds it to the light, and, with the significant question, " You have nothin,g " else ?" goes to his " Detector,"-a book which, as our correspondent says, " is itself a comment " on the whole system,"-to see if he can find anything about his new paper acquaintance there. If that index expurgatorius, that black list " of "broken banks, suspensions, and known counter"feits," does not include the offered note, he accepts it, but stmll reluctantly and suspiciously. Every shopkeeper in the Union is thoroughly familiar with this process; he repeats it many times every day. The uncontrolled issue of local paper money is the cause of this. The Federal Government, while it reserves to itself the privilege of coining, practically leaves every State of the Union to a paper coinage of its own, the consequence of which liberty is the greatest difference of value between the notes of different States. And when there is difference of value there is also-what is the worst part of it-a great uncertainty as to what that difference is; so that, in fact, nobody in America exactly knows, when he Is paid for anything, what and how much is paid him. A five-pound note is a five-pound note in this country, everybody knows what it is, but a five-pound note in Amorica is not a fivepound note-i.e., not absolutely one, but with a qualification-it is a "Louisiana," or a "South " Carolina," or an "Ohio," or a "M issouri," or a "Maine," or an "Alabama" five-pound note. The paper coin of the different " Sovereignties" has all its different value and its vam1fing value. And, as if for the express purpose of increasing the uncertainty in the value of notes, the rivalry of the different States comes in to make a factitious and arbitrary difference, even when there is none on really commercial grounds. The shops and hotels of St. Louis rejected the notes of Illinois, even cabdrivers and omnibus men would not touch them at the late State cattle fair-why ? The notes were based on the same stock, funds, and debt of their respective States, andthe Missouri Stock was every bit as Illinois Stock. The reason was simple State rivalry. There was bad feeling between the two States. The consequence was that nobody in Illinois would pay the compliment to Mhissouri which is implied in that trust in Miesourian Stock, which trust in Missourian Stock is implied in taking Missourian notes. Or, what is the same thing, everybody in Illinois tbought that everyhoay else would look at Missourian notes in this light, and therefore nobody would incommode himself by taking what he thougbt his neighbours would not acknowledge. A general idea i3 the same as a reality in such a case. Now, in this state of things, of course, the monopolist companies take the law into their own hand, and reject eveiything but bullion. They do this because they cam do it-because they can compel a public, unable to do without them, to submit to their own terms; though this,is sometimes tried without success, and the Mississippi Steam Company, after its announcement that it would only " take " currency," obtained no cargoes. But the claim is successful in some cases. First of all, the Federal Government insists upon specie, and will not touch a single note of any bank in the United States. This excites the wrath of the high-rouled American financier, who looks upon this Government rule as an unfair, mean policy-the view that a schoolboy would take of an extreme and ungenerous pressulre of the rules of the game. This Government claim, which simply amounts to a claim for the exact sum and no more or less than what is owing to it, is stigmatized as " the excess of "cynicism." The popular feelingin America goes with the paper circulation, and jealously watches all attempts to bring it into difficulties or to charge it with its extreme responsibilities. It has bred a set of conventional rules, a sort of code of honour, in connexion with the paper system. If these rules of the game are violated, the sneak and dastard who wants to have money for his notes is rightly " served out." The " assorter, " which is the name of a person who collects in one State the notes of another State, and sends back these travellers that have wandered to a fortunate distance from their responsible source home again,-the " assorter" is regarded in America rather as a goldsweater would be here. He is looked upon as playing unfair tricks with the cir- i culating medium. An agent with a carpetbag full of these exiles found on his arrival an indignant crowd, summoned by a hostile telegraph, awaiting him, and very wisely returned with his carpetbag unopened and his own person not tarred and feathered, as it would certainly have been had he attempted a visit on the bank. When once a note has gone abroad it is considered an exile for life-not an unhappy, but a blissful emigrant into a region of perpetual freedom and joy-the true negative paradise of the baDk-note, a state of transcendant annihilation,-total disconnexion with payment. The American Bank, on dismissing its 10J.-note, sends it away with the paternal blessing of the Welsh father-" My lad, never let me see your " face again," but does not accompany its blessing with the traditional half-crown which is popularly appended to the Welsh one. It is easy to see how such a circulating medium must affect trade. Government and the great monopolists can insure specie, but the ordinary tradesman depends on a fluctuating, slippery medium, of which he never can know the exact value, even when substantially safe, and which he is never sure is sae. How is a tradesman to regulate his profits under such circumstances The whole is a risk from beginning to end. And this atmosphere of risk is the regular atmosphere of the American tradesman. No wonderthat with such an education he takes the convulsions of his money-market coolly.
Among the numerous plans for civilizing, Chris.- tiazing, or Anglicizing India, one has been suggested which is likely to be not the least effectual, while it is eminently simple and unobjectionable. ! The 24 letters of the Roman alphabet, familiar as they are to ourselves, constituts one of the most felicitous of human discoveries. The cognate o Greek characters, although equaly expressive and! convenient, of;er no advantages to counterbalance the obvious utility of a type which is common to the greater part of Europe. The Oriental alphabets generally represent the wants of a learned oligarchy rather than the necessities of an educated cornmunity. It is said by competent observers that no native can read Persian or Sanscrit characters with the ease and rapidity to which Europeans are accustomed. The Roman type is compacter, cheaper, and more legible than any other mode of representing the indigenous languages. Missionaries and promoters of education have for a whole generation been endeavouring to reduce all the Indian dialects to the same familiar notation. There are reasons which now render it expedient for the Government to give official support to the undertaking. Tt is desirable both that natives should be attracted to the study of English, and that all difficulties which impede the intercourse of the governing race with the population should be as far as ponsible removed. many Englishmen who have acquired a certain colloquial knowledge of the native languages are unable to transact business from their ignorance of the Persian character. A long period must elapse before English can become the official language, and doubts may be entertained whether such a result is in itself desirable; but there can be no reason why Eindostanee or Telegoo should not be rendered as intelligible as the case admits of. In a large portion of the empire there is not even room for innovation. There are districts larger than Great Britain which have no written language, and consequently no prejudices in favour of any peculiar type. There can be no reason why the English alphabet, which has within a century given a written form to the dialects of the HIighlands and of Ireland, should not represent the utterances of 'the North-Eastern Province. Only 10 or 12 years have elapsed since a similar process 'was applied by the local Government to the Pheenician Arabic of the Maltese, who had been left by the Knights of St. John and by the dominant priests to the enjoyment of a purely orel language. The official Persian alphabet is as completely alien as our own. The Maliomedan conquerors naturally used their own language where it could be introduced, and where it was necessary to adopt words from their subjects they retained the use of the characters with which they were familiar. The Deva-Nagri or Sanscrit type, although more properly national, varies so widely in different parts of the country as to be comparatively useless. Of some of the indigenous alphabets it is suffic:ent to say that the type-founder would be compelled to provide several hundred forms in place of the 24 Roman letters. It must be admitted that the adaptation of the alphabet to our own vernacular use is not a matter of national pride. The unfortunatePFonetic! Nuz was an unsuccessful protest against an orthography which can only be learnt by experience. There is, perhaps, no written English word which is not phonetically expressive of some provincial pronunciation; but the conventional language of literature and of society smooths over the polySyllabic roughnesses which are still recorded in the traditional spelling. It is a still graver inco.ivenience that the first three vowels of the alphabet represent each two distinct vocal sounds. The connexion between sounds and symbols, like most other English institutions, is in a great measure accidental, and is wholly unfit for transplantation. Fortunately, no practical difficulty arses from this insular anomaly. The Roman characters applied to Italian represent a pronunciation which is sufficiently consistent and uniform. A century ago Sir WmAr JoNEs proposed this method of I representing the Oriental languages. Since that l time the Missionary and Bible Societies have for the most part adopted his system in their attempts l to fix the innumerable heathen languages which' they desire to consecrate to their own objects. I A religious newspaper published at Mirzapore ! uses the same type which is employed to express equivalent sounds by the American missionaries in the Sandwich Islands. In default of a universal! language, a common set of characters tends in some degree to remove the impedimerts to intercourse among different races of mankind. If the system became general, even Anglo-Indian writers might perhaps condescend to adopt some uniformity of spelling. Any one of the 10 or 12 names given to the capital of Affghanistan would approximately represent a word which seems to have been selected as an orthographic purzzle. The most enthusiastic 'riends of India would find it difficult to crea .e a grievance out of the introduction of a convenient alphabet. The reading community bears but a small proportion to the population of the empire; and it is by no means to be supposed that an Indian education implies a facility of reading fluently at sight. All the natives who are really instructed are already familiar with the English character, and the remainder might be allowed for a certain limited time to use their own indIgenous varieties of type. Bills of exchange, contracts, and otber legal documents might by degrees be brought under the improved system; and the lapse of a single generation would probably consga all the native modes of writing to oblivion. It is justly remarked by the advocates of the change that even Hindoos are comparatively exempt from prejudice at three or four years old. A child who exercised a choice would certainly give his vote in favour of ihe easier alphabel.. The mode of introducing the reformed system must, of course, be determined by the sagacity of ocal administrators. A court or a public office annot compel suitors and taxpayers, except after a considerable specified interval, to adopt an -mproved method of writing; but official docu- ments and correspondence might at an earlier period furnish an example, and native ingenuity might be trusted to decipher writings affecting Iractical iuterests. Even trained scho'ars and experienced functionaries would find their labours greatly diminished by the adoption of a more familiar type. The inconvenience of a strange character is well known to all Engiishmen who have had occasicn to engage in a German correspondence. Some travellers affect to write the current hand of the country, but the power of reading it with accuracy and fluency is a rare accomplishment among aliens. To uninstructed eyes Persian, though far more graceful, is almost equally confusing in its forms. The introduction of our own type will be at the same time a convenience to ourselves and a valuable boon to all future generations of Indians. __1
Our contemporary the Constitutionue has actually expressed its willingness to accept a " serious dis" cussion" on the Passport system. We sincerely trust this offer implies some resolution to place the system on its own merits, and to leave it to staud or fall by the conclusions arrived at. With the hope of such a result we return to the subjecteven in the midst of more momentous and engrossing topics, for although, as our contemporary very truly remarks, the vexation of English travellers is not quite so important a matter as the Indian mautinies, it is worth a little trouble to convict a system which does more to embarrass the intercourse of two great and friendly countries than any other incident affecting the communications between them. M. CAuvAn, who undertakes the defence of the Passport system, and who characterizes our objections to it as " calumnies" against the customs of a foreign State, is not content with affirming that the system, after all, really prevails in England as well as in France, but roundly declares that, in more respects than one, it operates as a positive protection to people on their travels. The former of these assertions will astonish most of our readers, whether British or foreign, and especially when we observe that M. CAuvA&s authority for his statement is drawn exclusively from our own columns. A few days ago a correspondent called our attention to the fact that, according to certain regulations, a stranger arriving at Folkestone was bound under a penalty of 40s. to present himself zt an office in the Custom-house, produce his passport, and receive a certificate of his arriv,'I. Etow far these regulations are enforced we do not pretend to know, but this much we venture to say, that no foreigner travelling in England would ever think of asserting on his return that he had experienced the least delay, extortion, or annoyance in respect of his passport from the first moment of his visit to the last. We put the case in this broad light to bring the question at once to issue; but, assuming even that the rule referred to is rigidly executed, what possib]e analogy, we ask, can be established between such a provision and the elaborate system of passports prevailing on the continent? In England, at the most, a foreigner (not an Englishman) may be required, on entering an office which he must needs visit under any circumstances, to register his name. There ends the whole regulation. There is no system about the proceeding, no machinery for conducting it, and, above all, no penalty wor'h mentioning for leaving the thing undone altogether. The traveller cannot be detained, at the one single point of detention, more than a minute or two, and, if he objects even to this delay, he may snaphis fingers and go off straight with no other liability than a fine of a couple of sovereigns. With this arrangement let AL CAuvA= compare the "manners and customs" which he stands up to defend. A system of the mo3t extensive and complex description, embracing every department, every prefecture, every town, and every port, is maintained at a large cost, and with an enormous staff of officers, for the simple purpose of tracking like a thief every peson who stirs from his home. Not only Englishmen, but Frenchmen too, on their own native soil,. are compelled, before they can travel a dozen miles, to procure permission to do so by personal application, and to carry about with them, and produce upon every demand, an official warrant entitling them to be where they are. This warrant must be inspected, examined, revised, exchanged, and passed through every conceivable process of verification and regisnratson, with a perpetual infliction of small expense and an interminable tax upon patience. To crown all, supposing that through ignorance the ceremony, or any incident oI it, has been omitted, or imperfectly transacted, or the warrant itself by any accident lost or mislaid, the consequences become equivalent to those of actual felony for the time being. An unfortunate traveller with no passport or an informal one is impounded forthwith, is forbidden to pursue his journey no matter what may be the urgency of the case, and may be very thankful if the surveillance under which he is placed falls something short of positive imprisonment. So much for the " complete analogy" subsisting between English and continental institutions in this respect. M. CAUvAIN, however, takes higher ground than the mere tuc qtw1tqe argument when he asserts of the Passport system that it is a real comeort and convenience to travellers. Did he ever find a traveller who thought so ? Certainly, if Frenchmen choose to put themselves through these "simple "formalities," it is not for us to cavil at their fancy ; but, as we are presumed to know something of English opinion, our contemporary will perhaps accept our word for the fact, that we are utterly insensible to the benefit designed, and wish for nothing more heartily than that the whole system should be exploded to-morrow. If there be any advantages attending it we surrender them all wii'hout a moment's hesitation. An Englishman is perfectly satisfied of his own " identity" without getting it " established" by a certificate of police; he can find the way to his own Ambassador without the sanction of" a constable, and provide himself with money for his journey apart from the kind offices of either Mayor or gendarmnes. In so far as the system is kept up for our benefit we can confidently assure M. CAuvAnq that the labour is utterly thrown away, and that it may be abolished this very instant not only without remonstrauce on our part, but with the greatest possible satisfaction to all classes in the habit of visiting their continental neighbours. The matter is really not quite so trivial as it appears. To be sure, the extortions of the system are on a petty scale and the annoyances not often of a very afflicting kind, but they are sufficient altogether to keep some persons away from France who would very gladly go there, and, what is of far more consequence, the perpetual irritation, though slight perhaps in itself, inevitably operates to the prejudice of the views with which an Englishman might otherwise return from a country in many respects better managed than his own. Perhaps the people of other nations do not suffer quite so much as we do, but there is nothing so disagreeable to an Englishman as small interruptions for small demands. It is as much as ever we can do to endure a turnpike; in facu, in London we have abolished them, and in Wales they pulled them down. A man spending a thousand a-year without stint will go halfSa-mile round to avoid a bridge where he vould be stopped for a halfpenny. We do not like to be interfered with at all ; still less do we like to be gauged and measured like a bale of goods, stamped with a brand, and then put in circulation, to be tested and branded over again at the next police-office. We do this kind of thing in our prisons, because there is no avoiding it, but when we visit a foreign country prepared to admire it and to enjoy ourselves, we do not like to be handled as if we were in a convict settlement. If all this were necessary either from geographical configuration, or frontier difficulties, or any other iacideat of cQcxtixental positioni we could only submit with the beat grace pousible; but ii maintain that it is not so, and we appeal *( every day's experience in proof of our wordi. There is not a police-offlcer on the continent who would place a moment's reliance on the Paasport system as an effective instrument of detection or security. A conspirator denounced by half-&. dozen Governments, and hunted by as ma i police agents, can notoriously travel through territory after territory without experiencing the least interruption. Persons really exposed to suspicion are never at fault. 71ey know well enough every form and feature of the requisitions established, and are only too ready to comply with them in the lDinutest particular as the price of escape. To them the Passport system is reaUy a protection, for it provides them with what they would otherwise lack-a certificate of character; nor does it signify a sou whether this certificate is true or false so long as it is "regular." The true operation of the Passport system consists in the easy rehabilitation of rogues. When characters are sold by the franc on Government guarantee, any man with silver in his pocket can in a moment become as respectable as his neighbour. A piece of stamped paper covers all, and the end of the whole machinery is a moral masquerade, in which dominoes are provided at two shillings each and the disguise made current by authority.
The Indian Mutiny is one of those critical events which compel nations and individuals to drop the mask and to stand forth in their real characters. At the seat of the rebellion it has brought to light who have been our friends, who have been our enemies, what are the most trivial defects of our government, what are the most hidden feelings of the people governed. At home it has proved to the uttermost the spirit of the British nation and the extent of its resources; and we can point to the result with a pride which, when we remember the forebodings excited by the first news of disaster, is not unnaturaL Abroad it has revealed who among our allies have a genuine [sympathy with us, who under the forms of a politic friendship entertain a secret enmity, and who, while on the whole most amicaole in their intentions, are amicable only in the sense of that cynical philosopher who maintained that friendship is always selfish, and that our very best friends have some satisfaction in hearing of our misfortunes. Amid theee discoveries, the expressions of goodwill which we quote to-day from a Norwegian newspaper will be received as one of the gratifying incidents by which our reverses in the East have been relieved. In a number of those ancient legends which we pousess in common with our Scandinavian kinsmen, it generally happens that when the King, by means of some magic robe or other strange contrivance, ventures to test the fidelity of his knights and dependents, he is astonished to find that while among the leading retainers there is not one upon whom he can rely, his true friend and most effective ally is some simple squire or stripling page whom he bad overlooked or despised. Now, although we are far from saying that ours is a case exactly parallel, although our position in Europe is not that of a King among his vassals, and although we are willing to believe that among our more powerful allies we have faithful friends, still at a time when we are told most frani-ly that we are not loved throughout Europe, the proffered sympathy of our Norwegian contemporary comes to us as a pleasant surprise. We do not overstep the bounds of modesty in accepting the statement that the destruction of our rule in India would not only be the worst calamity that could befall that country, but would also, by weakening our influence in Europe, immensely retard that liberty which is the first element of national happiness and that civilization which in the ultimate measure of national greatness. In accepting this statement, however, we express a conviction that our Norwegian friends give utterance to no idle compliment when they ask to subscribe to our Indian Fund, but to a belief which many besides themselves maintain throughout Europe and the world.

.-8USPBNSION OF THE TYF,,'RERN BANK OF SCOTLAND. (FROM OUR GLASGOW CO1ZRRNp.,,'I8-.' \ GLASGOW, MOSDAY .FTSRNOON. This day the Western Bank of Scotland, the head -office of rwhich is in this city, suspeiided payment, ibelng the first instance in which a joiat-stock bank in Scotland has met with such a calamity. From -the assistance which the Western received about ten -days ago from the other Scottish banks it was !loped that it mlght be enabled to tide over the diffi-culty, but stiU considerable doubt was entertained in well-informed quarters. The banik opened this snorning as usual, and, although the day was a -very gloomy one in commercial circles, from the 3uspension of the Messrs. Dennistoun and other -Causes, the bank continned to transact business as nsual up till 2 o'clock, when the doors were sud-denly closed, and an intimationv was put up that the establishment had been compelled to suspend paymnent. It was accompanied by an intimation that -everything would be paid eventually in fall, the terms of which wiU be found in the telegraphic -despatch inserted in The Tlimes of yesterday. The :s-anouncement caused a feeling of dismay over the whole city, and a similar result wilU be experienced over the whole of Scotland, for the Western Mad branches in every part of the kingdom, -amountin,g in all to about 100. It is now well known that this lamentable result has been caused by the most reckless mismanagement, which left the bank utterly unable to struggle .against the present crisis. Mr. John Taylor was appointed to the management in October, 1852, and At has now been ascertained that this gentleman has advanced the funds of the bank in the most -reckless manner to concerius which were totally manworthy of enlarged credit. Four of these con-cerns have become- bankrupt within the last month, and the losses by these houses alone are estimated at Snot less than 600,0001. At the same time the directors have exhibited very great negligence in overlooking the transactions of their manager. Mr. Taylor was disnissed from his oflice about four weeks ago, but it was too late to repair the mischief, -for an under-current of distrust had set in by which the deposits were in the course of being withdrawn to a vast amount. Looking -to this augmenting drain and the great mass of . American bills becoming due in London, the other banks found it was hopeless to attempt to sustain -the Western, and hence the catastrophe. The bank lad a paid-up capital of 1,500,0001., and previous to the setting in of the withdrawal of the deposits it was understood to hold deposits to the amount of about 5,000,0001. sterlng. Its banking powers were thus set down as more than seven millions sterling. It is consolatory that not a farthing will be lost 'by any but the shareholders, who amount altogether -to 1,200 persons. Among them, however, there are a large number of widows and orphans, whose -whole means had been invested in the bank shares, which of late years have paid a dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. There are also in the proprietary many of the most wealthy men in the kingdom, of whom may be -nentioned four of the brothers Baird, of Gartsherrie, who are well known to be able to pay the whole of the losses of the bank out of their own means, if -this were necessary. By a little patience, therefore, every person is certain to be paid in full. The present directors are,-Mr. Thomas Dunlop Douglas, -of Dunlop, deputy-governor; Mr. James Dunlop, Clyde Ironworks; Mr. Thomas M'Call, inerchant, Glasgow; Mr. Thomas Douglas Graham, merchant, Glasgow; Mr. Thomas Gray Buchanan, of Salston; Mr. Alexander Baird, of lrie; and Mr. William Logle, Hale-ide.
TIHE LIVERPOOL BOROUGH BANK. MtEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS. LIVERPOOL, Nov. 10. A special general meeting of the shareholders of this bank was held at the banklng-house this afternoon for the pu-. -pose of considering the propriety of the bank being -forthwith registered as a company under the Joint-Stock Banking Companies' Act, 1857. Our correspondent and the representatlves of the local newspapers presented themselves at the door at the time announced for the commencement of the meeting, but he and they were informed that the proceedings would be strictly private, no one except shareholders belng allowed to be present, under the regulations of the bank; but that to so much of the proceedings as it might be deemed advisable to publish they should have access after the meeting had -broken up. The meeting was held with closed doors, and lasted about -three-quarters of an hour, and our correspondent was afterwards permitted to copy the following offcial memocandum:- "A At a general meeting of the company caUed the Liverpool Borough Bank, duly summoned in pursuanc, of the Joint-Stock Banking Companies' Act, 1S57, and of the deed of settloment of the said company, for the purpose of obtaining the assent of a majority of the shareholders of the eaid company present at such nmeeting to the registration of the company under the aforesaid Act, held at the bankinghouse of the said company, in Water-street, Liverpool, on the 10th day of November, 1857, "' Ur. William Rathbone, chairman of the bank, in the chair; present 103 persons. holding 36,654 shares; and proxies were handed in for 37 persons, holding 21,887 shares, "1 It was moved by Mr. J. B. Brancker, and seconded by -Mr. Samual hiartin, and carried unanimously:- " ' That the baiking company called the Liverpool Borough Bank be forthwith registered as a company under the Joint-Stock Banking Companies' Act, 1857.' " On the motion of Mr. H. Kihick, it was resolved unanimnouslv: T'ihat the thanks of the meeting are due and are hereby given to the committee of shareholders for their valuable services; and that they be requested to render their ass5-tAnce.' " On the motion of Mr. Brancker, seconded by Mr. John Cooper, it was resolved unanimuously,- " ' T'hat the meeting be adjourzed till Thursday, the 12th ist., at 2 o'clock, for the purposs of allo wing,the company to be registered in the meantime under the Joint-Stock lankiug Companies' Act, 1857, and upon such registration being effected to receive from the directors a statement of the affairs and concerns of the company, and to take into consideration the propriety of winding up voluntarily under the provisions of the Joint-Stock Banking. Companies' Act, 1857, or of taking such proceedings as may be deemed ex.pedient.' " WM. E UTHBONE, Chairman. "Liverpool Borough Bank, Liverpool, Nov. 10." From shareholders present during the meeting we learn -that the proceedings were thoroughly harmonious, and that the resolations were adopted without opposition. hlr. W. RATIMONE opened the proceedings by stating that the directors at the right time would be prepared to answer any questions put to them, and that they hoped that when the accounts were produced on Thursday they would be found satisfactory. Mr. BEASICxcR, the chairman of the shareholders, explained that the committee of the shareholders, represent. ing very large Interests (to the amount, it is said, of 1,000,0001.), were unanimous in approving the course taken by the directors, and he called upon Mr. Field, of .,the firm of Sharp, Field and Jackson, attorneys,London, who had examined the affairs of the bank, to make a statement /to the meeting. Mr. FIELD is said to have explained the advantages to be -derived from placing the bank under the operation of the Joint-Stock Companies' Act, 1S;57, by which the share. holders and the depositors would be enabled jointly to ;&ppoint liquidators, who would have charge of winding mp the bank in the way which would press the least severely upon the shareholders, and which would realise the assets as fully as possible for the advantage of the general creditors. He is reported to have stated that ,the great object In matters of this kind was unanimity and Ounfou between all parties coneerned, without which this jbank might have ended like the BritishBank, where allw en' 0o law, and the asmeta woer very small compated with wiast they might have been. He said he had had a great deal to do 'with various ba,.kibv establishments, but be had never been connected with one in wbich the directors came out more honoarably fiouo axiy ch-rge of serving personal interests The Borough Bank would not lose anythiDg by ibt direotors, or by their relatives or connexions. They had stayed honestly by the hank to the last. In similar case5 he had known instauces in which directors nd other5 interested had availtd themselves of their positions to sell out before pressure came, but in the case of the Borough Bank every director had stuck to the ship, and bad used hiP best endeavours to hring about a satisfactory arrangement. Mr. J. B BRANCKEI, ia moving the second resolution, stated that, while he did not wish to commit himself to figures, he bad been so far able to go into the affairs of the bank as to be in a position to say that theywere looking mauch more favourable than was expected. He belleved that Mr. Banner (the accountant) would pledge himself to this statenment without going into figures, whioh would be before them on Thursday. Mr. KILLICIc, as a shareholder, thought that every shareholder should feel greatly indebted to the committee of sharebolders for the part they had taken in endeavouring to bring about a san sfactory arrangement. A question was asked of Mr. Field whether by being placed under this Act the shareholders would be relieved from personal arrest. Mr. FIELD replied that would be the effect; that the whole matter would be placed in the hands of liquidators, who would be empowered to make such calls as might be deemed requisite, spreading the payments of the debts over the whole body of creditors who were able to pay, with. out oppressing one or two persons. The liquidators will be appointed-one by the directors, one by the creditors, one by the independent shareholders, and one by the bill holders in London, together with Mr. Banner, of Liverpool, the accouatant. We may add that the directors and the committee of 15 shareholders elected by the general body of shareholder and the de positors' committee are declared to be unauimous as to the course wbich has been taken. The effect of this meeting has been to create greater confidence in the town.
THE ANDA MAN ISLANDS, A PENAL SETTLE. MENT FOR IIVDIA. TO THE EDITORt OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I beg to offer a fewsuggestions which, in thepresent crisis of Indian affairs, may not be considered unworthy of your acceptance and consideration. When the reinforcements seanxieusly looked for in India shall at last have arrived from home, and we are enabled to follow up and punish those who have tortured and massacred so many hundreds of our countrymen, the question may arise, " How are we to dispose of so many felons " Indiscriminate hanging, no doubt, would be the safest and easiest remedy; but our English notions of justice and our name as a Christian nation preclude all chance of " a consummation so devoutly to be wished for," and we shall therefore have on our hands a crowd of convicts, who either must be kept in prisons, to work in gangs on the roads in India, or be transported for life. Now, even if the police of Bengal were to be dependod on (which they are not), or the charge of convicts deemed the fitting occupation for English soldiers (which it is not), these home eonvicts would be both expensive and dangerous to the State. They would be objects of sympathy to all the disaffected in India, and their prisons the recruiting depots for any fresh enormity that might be attempted. I have heard Ceylon, Mi auritius, the Cape, New Zealand, and even the West India Islands recommended as places -where they might be transoorted to; but, apart from the heavy expense which such a proceeding would entail on the country, these are all Queen's colonies, and the inhabitants would, it is more than probable, object to such an importation. Nearer India, and under the Company, we have Arracan, Burmah, and the Straits of Malacca, and convicts could be transported thither with ease and comparatively little expense, but to this also there are many objections. These places are al too near India, and any convlots who might escape would soon find their way back to Bengal, burning to revenge themselves in a manner we can but too wel imagine, to say nothing of the plots which the return of these men woald encourage or give rise to. Then, it would be unwise to give these mutinous rascals a chance of infecting the Madras Sepoy, or of bragging to the natives, who collect In those parts from all quarters of India, that in them they behold the patriots who endeavoured to rid their c ountry of Feringhees, and who thereby saved from poUution tho very caste they stiU enjoy, but which the Foringhees had tried to deprive them oZ, Within a few days' sail from Calcutta, and not very far from the coast of Burmah, washed on all sides by the Indian Ocean, lie the lands which I would suggest as the future penal settlem ent for India,-the Andaman Islands. These islands are little known, save as the abode of savages, who have also the unamiable character of being cannibals and as a fatal place for shipwrecks, or at best an inexhaust, Ible emporiumn for cocoanuts, Some of these islands are largoe but, though belonging nominally to England, they have been turnoed hitherto to no account. Whether the climate or the natives, or both, have been the cause of this neglect on our part I know not, but such considerations ought not to be admitted for a moment in the case of fiends whose guilt, if not actuaUy proved by the laws of England, is known by every man in India to be dark and horrible, -whose hands are stained with the blood of helpless women and children, and who are the basest and most treacherous of rebels, or, to say the least of them, who glory in the excesses and wickednesses of others, and connive at or allow the most horrible barbarities the world has ever known. I think there is not a inan in England who will consider any place too bad for such men. Let them be shipped off to the Andamans; let them be provided with a certain quantity of food and clothing, and with agricultural implements and seeds for tneir futura sustenance, and then leave them to their fate. Defenceless as the women and children they have murdered, let them make head, if they can, against savages not more bloodthirsty than themselves; and the Bengalee, who was too proud and too mighty in his own eyes to touch the food over which the shadow of an Englishman had passed, will have to dig with his own hands before he can sowtherice that keeps his wretched body and soul together. Should this be thought too severeameasure, thenestablish at once a footing on the Greater Andaman by means of the first batch of convicts, and make it the future penal settle. ment of India. Except those whose offences are comparatively trifling, and whose term of imprisonment is short, few convicts should be employed in future on the roads in India, for we have seen how in all these mutinies in Bengal to liberate the prisoners was the first thing attempted. The high-casto Brahmins, or, indeed, Bengalees in general, dread nothing so much as crossing the sea, or "dark water." It is pollution; and that is why few of them formerly anlisted for general service, and the fact of " general service" being now enforced on all fresh recruits is given as one reason for these outbreaks. Therefore, let the worst felons be shipped beyond the seas, and the prospect of Andainan wIll be worse than death itself to the " gentle Hindoo," whose caste, undefiled by innocent blood, can still, happily, be washed away by water. Surely for such awful crimes the punishment is light; and if we may not cast human beings away to perish unprotected, let them clear ground and build a fort for the soldiers who guardthem, and the lighthouse which is so much needed in these seas and on these very islands; and, instead of Andaman beiug the dread of every native craft in India, as It is nor/, its naturally good harbour will become a haven of safety for the ships of all nations, and in time a flourishing colony will spring up where, for want of clearing and cultivation, aU is barren and waste. I might go farther. When these wretched mutineers shall find themselves entirely cut off from their native land, their caste lost to tlhem for ever, and themselves dependent for the means of life and defence on the very race they have tried to exterminate, If any feeling of gratitude or remorse can exist in such hearts it will be awnakened, and some few hardened sinners may yet be brought to acknowledge their sin and their Saviour before they pass from earth to Him whose dread instrumeits of punishment they have been. One more observation concerning our occupation of the Andaman Islands I wish to make before concluding this letter. Might it not be a judicious and politic move on our part? for should England be again engaged in another great war, these islands are too near India not to escape (if unoccupied) the attention of her enemy, and a hostile fleet. with the sbelter and harbourage, provisions and water, which the Andamans afford, would be an awkward neighbour for our Indian empire. I remain. Sir. vour obedient +Pr--f ANDMATAN. Bangalore, Sept. 24.
KBIMSINGTON GARDENS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On passing through Kensington-gardens this morning on ray way to town, I was astonished and not a little indignant to see a number of labourers busily at work felling one of those heautiful trees which adorn the walk running to and parallel with the Bayswater-road. I had not proceeded far before I overtook a truck laden with the trunk of another forest tree, so that I greatly fear mnisohief i is intended In this part of the gardens. Many years ago, when Sir John Cam Hobhouse was Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, the destruction of these trees was determined upon; but the outcry then raised, both in Parliament and out of it, putt a stop, after much damage had been done, to the barbarons decign. The reasonassigned was that the trees were dead, which was -natrue; and ir the same excuse be made now it is equally untrue. The unfortunate tree which has so recently come to an untimely end was in vigorous health yesterday, and it will take at least 100 years to grow such another. If you can do anything to help us in this matter, you wi much oblige, Sir. your ohediant . ANTI.GOTM, I lonlUxa KqrL 1Q.

THE REpRESENTATioN oF HARwICu.-One of the Liberal candidates, Mr. Tower, has retired from the field and has issued an address of some interest, ia the course of which he observes that he came forward ' under a belief that the great privilege intrusted to this borough would be exercised independently on the eve of a new reform bill. I desired to declare openly and fully before you all, electors and non-electors, my opinions on the great questions of the day, and I was prepared to fight a fair fight with any political opponent. But I was not prepared to find the Liberal party divided and distracted as it now is. I deprecate the cause of this disunion-viz., the attempt by the son of the present member to obtain possession of the vacant seat. I refrain from any steps tending to widen the unseemly schism, and leave the solution in your own bands. A seat in Parliament offers no attraction to me, if it is not based on free and popular election; and as an honest man I denounce in our own ranks any ap. proximation to the monopolizing spirit and close borough system which we Liberals would fearlessly expose it It were practised by our political opponents." Mr. Dodd, formerly M.P. for Maidstone has paid a visit to the borough ; whether he will offer himself as a candidate remains to be proved. Mr. Areedeckne and Mr. Bagshaw are still before the electors. TEE NORTa-EASTERN PoRTs,-The export trade of the North-Eastern Ports during the past month of October does not exhibit so considerable a decrease in comparison with the corresponding period of last Wear as might probably, under all circumstances, have een anticipated, The following are the returns as given in " Brown's Export List" just published:NewcasVle.-Total value of goods. exohisive of coal and coke, exported octbober, 1857, 100,3501. ; ditto, October, 1856, 109,7121.; dec.ease, 9,3621.

FOBEBU mArTELLIGENCE. FRANCR (PROM OUR OWN CO1RSP(ONDT)1rNT'l [The following appeared in our second edition of yest.tday :-] PiARIS, XONDAY. Nov. 9, 6 P.M. | It is reported that a telegraphic message was re- ceived this morning in official quarters announcing i that some of the foreign Representatives had offered their services to Redschid Pasha to put an end to the mi8understanding between him and fMi. Thouvenel, and that Redschid had accepted them. The Emperor of the French continues much dissatisfied with the state of affairs at Constantinople, and perhapi may soon begin to talk of the " sick man." Redschid'sfall from power was in consequence of his intervention in the Moldavian electious, and the Emperor feels it as an indignity that, as soon as these terminated contrary to the wish of that Minister, he should again be restored to office. This he appears to consider as a protest against what has taken place in the Principalities. The Journal aes Debats announces its having received the cahier des cha-ges or terms on which the Greek Government has granted the concession of the railroad to be constructed between Athens and thePirseus. TheDabats states thatthe concession is for 55 years, to date from the issuing of the Royal decree. This is an error-the concession is for 75 years. The deposit of 30,000 drachmas is required as a guarantee for the contractor's fulfilment ot his contract.. The works are to be completed in two years. The materials required for the construction wvill be imported duty free. M. Abbatucci, Minister of Justice, is still dangerously ill. It is rumoured that M. Billault will take his place definitively, and that M. PRouland, the present Minister of Public Instruction, or M. Fietri, Prefect of Police, will succeed M. Billault in the Home Department. MX Henri Cauvain is resolved to break another lance in defence of the passport system. He clings to that object of his admiration and affection with a tenacity and a courage worthy of a nobler cause. The Constitutionnei of yesterday has nearly two columns on that interesting topic. The letter of a gentleman named Gilpin (M. Cauvain is sure to mistake him for Cowper's hero), published in The Times of Wednesday last, referring to a notice (avis ann etrangers) posted up in the steamboat and railway offices at Folkestone, and requiring the captains of steamers to dehver in to the Customs a list of foreigners among their passengers, fillshim with joy at the discovery that the passport system pre- vails in England all the same as in France. AL Cauvain quotes the " ars" with great satisfaction, but passes over the remark of your correspondent, that the officials do not enforce the letter of the law, which he describes as useless and odious. Now, it is possible that such a notice is posted up at Folkestone and elsewhere. It is, perhaps, a remnant of the Alien BillU but it tells much for its utter harmlessness that out of the multitude of foreigners who constantly visit England, and travel through the three kingdoms, probably not half a dozen are aware of its existence and are inconvenienced by it. If M. Cauvain inquires, he may discover that there are, perhaps, several old laws in the statute-book which, though not repealed, are never acted upon, and that they have long since fallen into disuse. He may also learn that Parliamentary reporting is not interfered with, though there are standing orders which prohibit the presence of " strangers" in either House of Parliament. The question is one of fact, and M. Cauvain is bold enough to affirm that "the stranger who visits England is subjected to police measures completely similar to those which exist with us (in France); and that precautions of the same nature are applied to strangers who travel in England." To a man who maintains such an assertion in the face of the whole travelling world, tbere is nothing to be said, except to repeat your invitation to visit England and judge for himself. M. Cauvain says he has travelled a great deal. Very probably; but he has evidently not yet crossed the Channel, though the voyage is not very long or very dangerous. Let him take a run to Folkestone, where the terrible "aia" mentioned by M r. Gilpin is posted up, and he may then enlighten the Co,sstiutionnel on his personal experience of the passport system as practised in England. M. Cauvain does not find anything vexatious in what he cals "a simple formality of administrative surveillance ;" and he has ridiculed the notion of any incoavenience or humiliation attending it. I give him two instances, among others, of "inconvenience." Not very long ago a lady wishing to pay a viait to Paris was refused a passport in her native town (in the south of France) until she procured two temoins patentis-that is, licensed shopkeepers-of the same town to prove her identity. Again, a young lad, hardly 16, leaving Paris on a visit to his relations in the same town, was on his arrival p!aced in the custody of two sergens de 'olle, and conducted by them to the poliee authorities, because he brought no passport with him from Paris. If M. Cauvain pronounces these things neither vexatious nor inconvenient, his notion of vexation and inconvenience must be worth knowing. M. Cauvain has been amused at Englishmen fancying that the obligation of procuring passports was felt by them as degrading and humiliating. Now, I submit that in denying the fact M. Cauvain shows strange ignorance of the meanlig attached to passports by theauthorities. The law of the the 10th Vindniaire, An IV. of the Republic (tit. 3, Art. 6 and 7), which regularly established the system, and which is still enforced, pre3cribes as follows Every individual traveLling without a passport is arrested and detained until he gives proof of his domicile, and fo his reclamation by citizens known a.d domiciled, and until he is set right with the authorities (iusqie'd ce qu'il soit mis en regle). Should he not fulfil these formalities he is considered as a t'agabond, andprosecuted as such." So much for the inoffensive character of passports. M. Cauvain appeals to the testimony of an Englishman on passports in England. I Irppeal, inturn, to that of a French writer, in order to show that all his fellow-citizens do not think precisely as he does on the subject. The following is an extract from an article in the aw'jdcp6die du Langage et des Sciences Politiues, under the head l PaPaeports":- " "In financial and political point of view passports are at once vexatious and useless-vexatious because the faculty of moving about and travelllng being one of comoon right, and essentially affecting individual liberty, it is a violation of that liberty to force citizens to give the description of their persons (ignaemnt), and to inform police agents of the place to which they happen to be going. It is useless because reason and justice require that a tax should give to those who pay it some advantages towards their wellbeing and sseurity. The tax on passports affords no such advantage. In spite of the rigorous prescription of the law, which looks upon those who travel without passports as vagabonds, it is certain that a precautionary measure of the kind very rarely attains Its end. Persons without any honest calling or livelihood, those who are within the reach of the Penal Code, know perfectly well how to procure for themselves fauitless passports. Sharpers, bankrupts, and many others whose occupation consistsiin getting iato their hands other men'a purses and property-all such voyageurs forc6s have never been found in want of pass. poros (feuiUes de route) which enable them to evade justice. Passports do no t exist in Englend. There the citizen who travels has no need, in order to traverse the three king dorns, to obtain the permission of a police magistrate. There commerce and indastr are not exposed to such impediments, but are perfectly unfettered. Tbere peoeG c go and come, and stop, as i si ssits them, or as it pleases t them. The roads and the streets are free frem all police inquistion."~ Such is the opinion of a Frenchmian. How it will be estimated by IN Caarvain I cannot determine. This gentleman is evidently enamowreal of the system. The paradise of L ha imagination must be some planet where it is carried out in perfection; where the wor d laiszezaier is ab absoluty unknown, and where the inhabitnts are all gendarmes, police agents, or of the cl lss described by the Law of Vind6mialre. For hi, the squalid-ooking edffice in the Rue de Jerusalem, where you are forced to get your portrait taken by iN. Pietri, ia grander than Solomon's Temple, in the venerable city of the same name. I am pretty sure that the fiction of mythology WIhich he admires moat is that of Cerberus, the firt gennaaan r on record, and who, no doubt, requi'ze& a feu tlWe de route before the ghost's admission in.'s i t the realms of Pluto. Once more, if M. Cauvain has still any doubt Of Itow these things are managed L i E Egland , lot him visit the country, ba wil then find that (in the words of Dryden):- "His [pa pnore is his innocence and grace, "Well knov,,x to all the natives of the Phxes." The high rate o o discount still presses on all branchesoof trsde, It restrains credit, and foresm the manufaw er l and even the retail traders,te sell } their good% at a las, and to submit to sacri&fi. in order to Tgccin g rwq1 e4Q and keep t4Qik Mgge- i I I?i ments. There is, however, no great accumulation of stock in their warebouses, and this will perhaps enable them to pass tbrough the present crisis without serious harm. For some time past the Paris as well as the provincial traders, in consequence of the facilities afforded by rail ways for transport have been in tbe habit of ordering only limited supplies, and of renewing their stock several times in the year, so far as was necessary for immediate consumption. By this means they haye avoided the obligation of very large payments. On the other hand, the manufactories have produced but little in advance, owing to the high price of the primary material; they have done little more than complete orders. The manufacturers of Alsace and Rouen, for instance, purchased at Havre but the quantity of cotton and wool absolutely requisite. The price paid a few years ago for these products was from 88f. to 9of. the bale, instead of 127f. as now, and they therefore avoided purchases on speculation, though apprehensive of a fall; and, as they were unable to raise the price of their fabrics in proportion to that of the primary material, they were careful to limit their production. The markets of Lyons, St. Etienne, Roubaix, and Paris are those which suffer most frona the effect of the American crisis. Bills return protested, and the Engagements which the large houses in these great centres of trade have contracted are yet to be met. One of the results is a considerable fall in the price of silks-in some instances of from 20 to 25 per cent. It is believed, however, tbat a rise will immediately enasue as soon as the embarrassment occasioned by the failures in Anerica pass away. The consumption of silk has not diminished, and the last crop was deficient. Advices from the manufacturing towns of the departments announce a complete stagnation in business. Purchasers have been at Rouen, Roubaix, Lille, Lyons, and St. Etienne, but their offers were so disadvantageous that little or no busineus could be done. Lyons and St. Etienne have still orders to complete for Paris and South America, and it is hoped that the consequences to these two great manufacturing places of the American crisis wiUl be less than was at first supposed. In Paris sales are slack, and the manufactories have, on account of the difficulty experienced in the moneymarket, and in the discount of their paper, adjourned their preparations for the winter season. The fall continues on various other articles, particularly oils, sugars, and unwrought cottons. Grain is offered for sale in all the markets. Prices are maintained better on flour than on wheat, and a fall has occurred in the latter below 20f. the hectolitre in all the markets, and more grain is brought to market than the farmers had kept for two years. In the Paris market transactions in flour are calm. Some sales have taken place at 2f. per sack less than the previous week's quotations, but only on second quality. Wheat was abundant at the corn markets on Wednesday last, and the farmers were obliged to submit to a fall of from If. to lif. per hectolitre and a half. Choice wheat was from 29if. to 30f.; good quality, from 28E. to 289f.; and ordinary, from 27f. to 27Af. ; Lorzaine wheat, to be delivered in December, from 27Af. to 28f. An adjudication of 12,000 quintals of wheat, to be delivered by the 15th December for the military intendance, has been effected. The provincial markets have all faUen, with the exception of Lyons, where there is a rise of If. ; and at MarseiUes, where every effort has been made to keep up tee market. The arrivals of the new Bulrgundy and Bordeaux wines were considerab'e during the past week at Bercy, and a good deal of business was done in them. Tn the opinion of the SiSc2e a duly on the export of precious metals is necessary, though not sufficient to conjure the financial crisis; that journal pronounces itself in favour of measures still more energetic, and thus expresses itself: "The establishment of a duty on exports of specie is not in our idea the only necessary measure. We persist in demanding a special measure of a character to stay speculation -we insist on the necessity of having bank--notes for small sams, and of even decreeing the forced circlation of notes. The crisis demands vigorous action. The path hitherto followed by the Bank of France has not been wise, since It has led to no improvement in the situation. Another policy must be chosen without further loss of time. A great number of manufacturers have, in consequence of the difficulty experienced in obtaining funds, ceased to purchase raw material or have diminished their production. Many bankers have decided on allowing the storm to pass by, and on rejecting aU commercial bills offered them. This state of matters must rot be allo'-ed to grow worse. The speculators in specie, warned of the duty which may be imposed on their exports, will not fVil to engage in the most extensive operations before the lssue of the decreo which commerce now awalts. Time ought not to be given them to exhaust the reserve of bulliou." The Pat.,ie was seized this afternoon for an article on the financial crisis. It had, in order to appear with its columns filled, to introduce another article in its place.

(Bosx ou OU N o ew CoRsroRSND r.) VIENNA, Nov. 7. By the subjoined summary of the annual report that has just been made by the Pesth " Chamber of Commerce and Trade to the Imperial authorities" you will perceive that the information which you bave from titue to time received from me relative to. the state of things and of public feeling in Hungary is strictly eorrect. Your particular attention is eaUed to the document, because it contains a plain straightforward statement of the necessities and wishes of the Hungarians, and at the same time points out the means of satisfying the-ration without infringing on the established principle of the unity and intdivisibility of the Austrian. EmpireF : "Hungary, whose sole wealth is in the soil, was duing three or four years blessed with rich hrvests, and was consequently able to contribute to the wants of foreign nsa tions. The war in the East, the state of the currency, and the improved communication enabled her for a time to sell her produce to great advantage. The construction of rail- ways and the development of the road and water communication have increased the value of IAnded prcjerty. TIe abolition of villenage and eoccage las made labour 3auch more valuable. The enormous prlcsa paid to workmen and labourers and the new taxes weigh heavily on the produc., ing classes. At present Hungary is unable to dispose of her produce except at ruinously low prices, and there Is little prospect of her being able to. somPete -with other corngrowing countries in foreigu, markets, unless she has more hands to till the so;% and consequently cheaper labour, and a rational employment of machinery and capitalThe following statement -ll give some idoa of the productiveness of tbe soil of Hangary if properly treated. In 1854 the PestYl-Buda Kmanmer-Bezirk (Chamber district) tilled and sa,vwed an sara of 2,500,000 acres, and reaped 19,000,000 yLetzen* of cern,which, after deducting the home consumption, fetched 15,00,OOOfl. The vineyards, covering an area r,f 144,200 aezes, produced 2,163,000 elmer (barrels) of win't. The produce of the forests in the Kanmmer.Bezirk was 240,000 trunks of trees, 2,000,000 planks, 50,COO,000 shi'agles, 5,000 klafter (a pile of logs which is three feet bhgh, and sir, feet long; the breadth of the klafter Tarie3 between 1& and 3 fet) of firewood. 300,000 metzen of rape- seed and 50,000 owt. of hemp were also grown: 200.000 calf-skins and 60,000 cwt. of wool were exported, Md tliE export duty on goods manufactured in the KammerBezrr} amounted to 697,000fl. The principal neceedties of Hungary are- 1. The abolition of the limitatioR of the rate of interest. 2. Improvement in the administztion of j cstice; that is, redintegration of the mrarket-cours (like our anoient 'pie-powder' courts), extension of th? sphere of action of the commere al courts, introduction of a commercial code, modification of the bankruptcy laws, permission to the Jews to acquire landed property, and, fnally, abolition of the antiquated guild ystem. " The peroration of the report deserves to be translated literally. It is as follows:- "HuIngary is devoted to itshereditary Kingand Lord. It sees in him the palladium of Its own political existeece. It is attached to him by that Epell which during so many oenturies made it hold faithfuly, courageously, and devotedly to the Throne. One of the necessities of public life is municipal self-government (brgerliche Se&st-VerwcaUung); but,instead of this, we have an organizntion which, being full of formalities, and bringing with it a vast deal of writing, is not suited to the settlement of matters of daily and honrly Occurrence. It is, besides, so expensive that it swallows up a great part of the revenue, which might be applied to the furtherance of rusefnl enterpries Certain it is that the results arrived at in all the different departments of the Administration are much too dearly purchased. Well-arranged municipal and communal laws, which are wished for and needed by thelieges, would be of advantage to the State, and we therefore hope that the lost finishing touch has not yet been given to regenerated Austria. " The correctness of some of tbe statements made by the Pesth-Buda Chamber of Commerce will probably be denied in official circles, but all the privat4 information which has ever reached me on the subs ject tends to confirm them. The news of the resignation of the Belgian Misisters has produced an extremely disagreeable impression in this priest-ridden country, and the Austrian Aliister at the Belgian Court, whohad leave of absence, has been sent back to his post. Count Appony, who had an audience of His Majesty on Wednesday, leaves for London this eveninL . It is said in the foreign papers that Baron Buibner is about to have an " indetinite" leave of absence; but the statement is not credited here. Government has just formed a contract with an American company for the construction of large floating docks at Pola. EAMBURGI. A letter from Hambnrg, of the 'th inst., in thv Independance Belge, states that on that and the preceding day there was a regular panic on the Stock Exchange. There was a fall in every descrip; tion of stock, as also on all bills of exchange. Bills on Franca, Belgium, and on the commercial marti of Gei-many and England were unsaleable at the usual three months' date. There is great want of specie. The financial crisis was also beginning to be felt in Sweden and Norway, and money was becoming scarce. The awnount of German bills drawn for merehandise of every dezcription and protested amounted on the 21at of October to nearly 1,000,0001. sterling. Since then the Vanderbilt has brought protested bills, between the 21st and 24th of Octo-; ber, to the amount of 200,0001. to 240,0001. more. ITALY. (PBOm oua owN coRnrzoxDraNmT.) TURIN, Nov. 6. Of Italian politics in general the affairs of the kingdom of Sardinia have usually more interest for people elsewhere than those of any other part of the Peninsula, and particularlyisthisthecase at pre. sent, on account of the approaching elections here, which are allowed on all sides to be of paramount importance for the whole of Italy, and, according to the clerical party, for all Christendom. That tle priesthood is really in earnest in attaching this very great importance to the present general election here is evident from the unprecedented exertions made by the clergy of this kingdom for the return of their candidates, and from the clear and positve instructions given by the chiefs of the Church to their subalterns to promote the cause of Rome by all means in their power. The Armonia of this morning publishes a pastoral leXter from the BishoDs and OhapterVicars of the ecclesiastical province of Turin to the faithful of their respective dioceses regarding the approaching elections of Deputies to the National Parliament, in which the following passages occur, which serve to show the peculiar views held by the clergy on the subject of their own duties and those of "free and Independent electors" under the present circumstances -. " Divine Providence, which disposes of ill things here below, has ordained such political conditions in our kingdom that we are called to exercise a sort of sovereignty inl the election of those on whom depends in part the conduct of our affairs. We are bound to recognize in this political arrangement the designs of Providence, and ccordingly to fulfil the obligations annexed to our condition. " You know well that the Divine Commandments may be violated by omission as well as by commission, and that we shaln have to render account to God for one crime as weeU as for the other. A crime of comminsion It would be in our case for whoover should for human objects, for interest, for love of vain honour%, for vile compliance with the desires of others, give his vote to a person careessl of the public good, or who might be an enemy of the Catholic Church. A sin of omission it would be, moreover, for whoever should unnecessarily absent himself from the elections, and leave a clear field for the less bonest and less good to elect as Deputies men witbout sincere and true love of countiy or even without religion, capable of proposing and approving laws fatal both to one and the other. Would not such conduct entail upon the oJenders remorse in life and the reproaches of conscience in death, the former thinking that by their vote they had cooperated to injure religion and the country, and the latter reflecting that the votw which they had abstained from exerctsing might perhaps have prevented a law injurious to religmous and civil society 5 " In a letter from the Archbishop of Chambery to the parish priests of his diocess, which appears ii the seme Turin paper to-day, it is inculcated- I "It is above all things obligatory on the electors not to vote for any but men of honour, ot recognized probity, and principally to vote for religious men sincerely devoted to Catholic princlples. The interests of Christianity, it is well understood, are perfectly in accord with the interests of the Monarchy. Too long have we sighed over the differences existing between our Government and the Holy Sed. Almost every G overmnnent in Europe that found itself in late days in a similar position has become reconciled to the Church. The perseveranoe in such disaccord of a State the religious traditions of which have always been so honourable is a great source of affliction for all sincere Catholic heartsfor all those who place the interests of God, the interests of eternity, before those of this world. Now, this reconciliation, so generally desired, depends especially on the Chamber which the electors are about ro form, since when the Deputies are men of heart they will end by always impressing on the Government a direction conformable to their principles." At Genoa, on the other hand, the CatWico appeals to the Municipaliem and to the base mundane impatience of taxation, from which it is to bs.feared the most religiouc readers of the Caltolico are not even exempt. That journal says:- " Electors ! Remember the taxes. Electors ! Recollect that Count Cavour is preparing a new cacsto (an estimate of property). Electors of Liguria ! Recollect that Count Cavoer said disdainfully that the Genoese y.id.nothing, and that they would comnence to pay after the new cotest was made ! Does not that appear to you pl:di speaking ?d" In The Times of the 3d inest. there is an article describing the want of sympathy inh a certain number of British subjects with the general indignation excited thronghout the kizgdom. at the atrocities committed by the Indian mutineor3. and. cuBously enough, she Milan Gaz,ffi of yasterday which came to hand here at the same tone, hasa letter from its London correspcAdent so strongly illustrative of the remarks of Tile Ti%,es, that I must beg your attention to the following extracts, which you will remernber appea- here in the pages of an} official journal. The iunter, w>ho. from hisa tyl& wfould give it to be unds od that he. is anx Englishmana, says . "Our papers are very cautio ig in Dablishing private letters from India this week.

uONEY-MARKET aid CITY INTBILIGBNO Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Parlis is about 7 per ulle premium, and the short exchange on London is 25'32i per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates :with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. .Oid. per. I gDunce for standard gold, it appears that gold is about 1-10th per cent. dearer in Paris than in london. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13 4J per 1. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 1-10th per cent dearer in London than in Haamburg. The quotation of the exchange at New York on London for biUls at 60 days' sight is about 106 1er cent. for first-class paper, but prices much lelow that are named for other descriptions. The rise in the rata of discount here to 10 per cent. will, however, prevent any profit on the transmission of gold from this country if a comparilon Is made with the above price of 106 per cent. The fands have shown absolute buoyancy to-day, and have closed at a further considerable advance. In mercantile quarters, also, there has perhaps been rather less uneasiness, and the tendency to a partial tecovery of confidence would have been stronger but for a manifestation of banking distruat at Glasgow In consequence of the closing yesterday of the Western Bank of Scotland. The attempts to create alarm at the high rate of discount in order to obtain an unlimited issue of notes seem to have diminished, respectable traders being unwilling to avow either that they are so destitute of capital as to be seriously imperilled by the existing charges, or that their object is to induce the Government to create an artificial rebound in the prices of produce at the cost of the consumer. Con. mols for money, which left off yesterday at 88i, -were first quoted 884 to J. Most of the brokers Jbeing buyers of stock on behalf of the public a further advance then took place to 89i. This was followed by a reaction to 884 to J, at which they remained to the official close, but almost immediately afterwards transactions occurred at 884 to 89 for money and 89a to J for the 7th of December. At a later hour there was another sudden advance, and bargains were effected for the account at 89g. The final price, however, was 894 to 4. The temporary relapse from the first rise in the morning vas consequent upon a demand for gold for transmiission to banks at Glasgow, while to explain the ultimate animation a variety of rumours were virculated, among which was one that a decree lad been issued in Paris for an immediate increase of the circulation by means of small notes, and another that the expected Indian despatches had arrived, and were of a veryfavourable character. One Rolution consisted in the statement that sorme amounts of stock wiU have to be bought back for a rpeculator who has been selling heavily, and who 'wll be unable to-morrow to meet hts differences. It was settling-day, and in the Stock-Exchange during the arrangement of the account the rate for loans on Government Securities was about 9 per cent., but at a later hour the demand increased. Bank Stock left off at 209 to 211; Reduced, 874 to 884; New Three per Cents., 88 to i; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 50s. to 40s. discount; and Exchequer Bills, 24s. to 17a. discount. There were no gold withdrawals from the Bank to-day for exportation, but sovereigns to the amount of 300,0001. or 400,0001. were taken for transmission to Scotland, the fal of the Western Bank having caused a run upon some of the other principal banks at Glasgow and elsewhere, including even the savings-banks. It 'isA reported that among the leading merchants in the north the announcement of the event yesterday created neither surprise nor agitation. The temporary inconvenience among depositors and note, 'holders must, however, be extensive and severe, while the shareholders, about 1,300 in number, many ofvwhom are women and persons of smaU Income, out of trade, will, it may be feared, in several cases suffer almost complete ruin. The fied Issue allowed to the bank under the Act of 1844 was 337,9381., and the extinction of this, estimating a reserve of one-third in gold to have been kept against it, will be equivalent to a contraction of 225,2921. in the circulation of the country-an event as nndesirable at the moment as the loss of so much bullion. A circular was addressed yesterday by the manager of the Western Bank of Scotland to the -various agents of that establishment, notifying its stoppage and explaining the circumstances which hand led to the disaster. It is admitted that for some years past, under the late manager, a system of overtrading has been carried on through the facilities afforded by the system of rediscounting. Reckless credits were given to customers in G'asgow, and a correspondent in New York 'was allowed to make advances on securities and to dav bills on the bank. Lately,onan investigation b.ing instituted into some of the largest advance accounts, it was found that the houses to which they had been made were utterly insolvent, and that a large loss to the bank was inevitable. The debtors -went into bankruptcy, the American panic came Da at the same time, deposits began to be 'withdrawn, and, finally, when the hour of pressure arrived the usual result was witnessed, and the firms in London who had hitherto promoted the financial system of the concern suddenly found it expedient to discontinue the rediscounts on which it had relied. Application for assistance was then made to the Bank of Scotland. The Bank of Scotlaud consulted the other Edinburgh banks and the 'Union Bank of Scotland, who declined granting any aid until an appeal had been made to the Bank of England. The Bank of England, of course, refused to interfere. The Scotch banks then offered 500,0001., but on condition that a winding up should take place. This was peremptorily resisted, and the 500,0001. 'was ultimately granted without condition. During the delay, however, many of the customers of the bank had begun to withdraw their deposits, and an application for further assistance was soon found neceesary. This met with a decided negative, and the stoppage accordingly took place. The directors do not give up all hope of the possibility of a resumption, and a general meeting is to be held in Glasgow at an early day. Meanwhile arrangements are to be attempted for the retirement of the note circulation, and if possible cof small deposits. Foreign stocks have been moderately dealt in, the only alteration of importance being a recovery of about A per cent. in Turkish. Speculative transactions continue limited. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 741; Portuguese, 424; Russian Five per Cents., 106; ditto, Four-and-a-Ralf per Cents., 960; Sardinian, 884 and i; Spanish N ew Deferred, 254 and i; ditto, Certificates, 5i and 5; Turkish Six per Cents., 87 and 87i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 964, 96, and 96i; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 63i. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon a consicderable rise took place in the rates upon all the principal places. In most instances the quotations showed a wide range, inferior paper being regarded with great distrnst owing to the serious difficlties occasioned in all parts of the continentby the Ane. rican crisis. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening w ore C66f. 85c. for money and 67f. for the end of the month, showing a recover7 of a quarter per cent. The advices from Paris assert that, although the cry of the speculators iX for an export duty on specie, a forced circulation of notes, and other measures equally absurd and unscrupulous, the Emperor coincides with the Bank of France that the true course to be pursued iB to advance the rate of discount-a conclusion, however, which does not harmonize with the reports current this evening on the London Stock-Exchange. The arguments of eome of the French papers for an augmentation of the supply of paper will gratify the opponents of the Bank Charter Act onthis side. It is necessary, it is said, to induce manufacturers "to purchase raw material," and to increase instead of diminishing their production. The only important failure announced to-day has been at Liverpool, the firm being that of Messrs. B. F. Babcock and Co., with houses also at Glasgow and New York. They have been brought down by the absence of remittances, and their liabilities are estimated at about 300,0001. At the last balance of their books in May they had a surplus of 150,0001., and, although their property has since suffered depreciation, they feel confident not only of being able to pay in full, but that a considerable sam will remnain to them. The failure of Messrs. Henry Dutilh and Co., also in the American trade at Liverpool, took place yesterday. In London the stoppage has been announced of Messrs Joseph Foot and Sons, silk manufacturers, but the liabilities are not supposed to exceed 40,0001., and little doubt seems to be entertained that the assets are ample to pay 20s. in the pound. Annexed is the circular issued:- "3 0, Spital-square, London, Nov. 10. "It is our painful duty to inform you that, owing to the failure of our London commission agents, and the consequent certain reurn of their acceptances in our. fsvour, we have felt it necessary to suspend our payments. Our books having been regularly kept and balanced, we enter. tain no doubt that, notwithstanding our losses, we shall be able not only to pay our debts in full, but to realize a sur. -plus. IJnder these crcumstaces we trust to your kind indulgence, and we pur;cose laying before you in a few days a statement of our affars which wll be pped by r. r G.EI. Jay, of Old Jewy-cisambos. r cdb " We remain, &c, JOSEPB FOOT 'D SONS." The private letters from New York by the Asia are all of a better tone than the newsaper accounts. Owing to the influx of specie the banks were beleved to contemplate resumption at a very early date. Annexed is an extract from a letter from one of the soundest and least sangiine merchants in the country:- "The specie now on the way will not make much, as sterling Is very sosios, and no good bills can be had under 105 to 106, and I expeat next week they willbe 108. Specie is worth only about dper cent. premium. I am happy to say. with the exception of the dry-goods interest, there is a better feeling in all branches of trade. The wholesale grocers are doing more business, and the banks discount more freely, but, as a matter of course, are very careful what a they take, It nothing very bad comes from England r think the worst Is over. Should we receive within the next month halt a mlllion aterling in gc-ld from Europe we shall have to ship it back again in January." At a meeting of the managers of the London joint-stock banks this afternoon it was resolved, with one exception, not to increase the rate of allowance for deposits beyond the existing point of 8 per cent. The Commercial Bank will grant 9 per cent. on the deposits at present in its hands, but will not allow more than 8 upon any that may be brought in future. The London and County will give only 8, but will offer Its customers (who may have expected it always to follow within I per cent. of the Bank rate of discount) the option of receiving, back at once all they have already lodged. Mess. Overend, Gurney, and Co., and other leading discount houses, will limit their rates for money to 8 per cent. at call and 8; per cent. with seven days' notice. It appears that a weekly communication with India is about to be established. The main points of an arrangement are said to have been agreed between the Government and the Peninsular and Orlental Company for a mail to and from India four times a-month instead of twice, as at present. It is intended to effect this by making the despatch of the mails to and from Bombay to alternate as regards dates with the departure of the malls to and from Calcutta, a plan which will bring four mails each way to Suez every month, the company undertaking to place such additional steamers on the Marseilles and Alexandria station as shaU sffice to convey four mails per month, both outward and homeward, between those ports. It is hoped this important extension of the company's postal operations may be brought into effect early next year, and it will doubtless be shortly followed by a corresponding increase in the number of communica tions vid Iouthampton. The Chrysolite has arrived from China with 293,1481b. of tea and 2,602 bales of silk. An extraordinary general meeting of the London General Omnibus Company was held this afternoon, M. Vacossin, president, in the chair. The report stated that it has been rfound necessary to continue to erect new stables, besides premises and machinery for the preparation of provender. A sum of 3,6301. has also been laid out in the purchase of new omnibuses with all the latest improvements, and in the alteration of such portion of the old stock as was worth the expense. The number of horses in the possession of the company on the 4th ofj July was 6,222, being an increase of 343 over the number at the close of last year. The average net earnings of each omnibus are about 6s. Id. a-day. Part of the unused capital not exceeding o0,0001. is proposed to be expended on the formation of lines of tramways in various parts of the metropolis. The net profits on the six months' working amount to 31,5821., out of which a dividend equal to 5 per cent. for the half-year was declared, 5381. being carried to next account. No discussion took place, and the report was adopted unanimously. 1,0001. was voted to a provident fund for the company's servants.

LEATHE A1ND HiDE.-At Leadenhal to-day the supply of fresh leather was again moderate.

RAILWAY AND MININSG HAR& Tueadiy E~vening. The railway-market has been dopressed, especially at the close, owing to large bond Jfde sales on account of the failures in the North and the position of the Scotch banks. During the present pres3urd dealers are disposed to limit their transactions, ani hence any forced realization, however small, occasions a redauction. At 4 o'clock Caledonians lef; off nearly 31. lower; Eastern Counties, 25s.; and South-Western, It. Lancashire and Yorkshire were also heavy ata decline of 108. York and North Midland, South-Eastern, and Great Northern, show no alteration. French shares were generally the sama as yesteriday. Dutch Rhenish were flatter. Canadian descriptions continue heavy, and a fall of nearly 21. occurred in Grand Trunk; the traffic returns being considered unfavourable. East 1ndian closed lOs. higher. In American securities Illinois Central and Pennsylvania Central receded. Canada Government bonds were also quoted at a reduction of 1Os. In mines the late advance In Alfred Consols was not fully maintained. Joint-stock banks wera quiet.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, Nov. 10. The market continues inactive. Spinners arc free sellers, but have great difficulty in finding customers, no reasonable concession In price being suffioient to induce business. The same description of the market applies to oloths, but in all branches of trade basiness is in some mneasure checked by the caution necessary to determine to whom credit can be safely eitended. Only one failare, and that not worth naming, has been mentioned this morning, and the losses sustained here by the large failures recently announced in London, Glasgow, and elsewhere are mostly by houses, it is reported, to whom they will occasion little more than temporary inconvenience. The curtailment of production by a resort to short time is spoken of as extending in all directions, and the long period of full work the operatives have had will enable them better to bear it than in some past times. It is only where mills are closed altogether that anything li-e considerable suffering is felt. Cases of this kind, unfortnuately, are very numerous, though bearing but a small proportion to those in which short time has been adopted. A proposition made at Glasgow that a deputation should go to London to induce a suspension of cash payments by the bank met with no countenance here from either of the commercial chambers, and telegraphic news from Glasgow this afternoon that two banks were being run upon there has occasined no alarm from a belief that they wil be able to meet the difficulty. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:- " Since Thursday last the market, owlng to the succesasve advances In the rate of alscount and the numerous heaTy tailures which have taken place. haa been exceedingly flat, and prices of au klnds of goods have seriously deolied. We hbae conslderably reduced our quotations td-day, but they mumt be taken as an approxlhnatlon only. as there is no demand to test them." LEEDS, Nov. 10. No improvement is noted in the cloth-halls this mornlng. A very limited amount of business has been done. There is a disposition on all sides to contract operations until the present monetary and commerciel crlsis is passed. The advance of the rate of discount to 10 per cent. by the Bank of En land, the late exteinsve faiunre recorded in 2%e in`ir, ana the comments in the City Article of that journal have excited attention. It is but 'truth to say that those commnents are generally coincided in by the commercial public, and a-e deemed to be most useful in keeping off a monetary panic. Commenting upon the present position of the money-market and of the trade of this district tho Lceds Mercury of to-day says:- " We have as yet no informatIon conc3tnlng the interview which a deputation of Glaegow merchants were to have had with Government on Monday; but we learn that the Iiverpoel men were not to attend at the interview. The measure resorted to on Monday by the Bank In raising tha sate of discounts to 10 per cent. would seem to indicate that no applicadlon for a rolazatlon of the Bank Charter Act, so as to choir of increased imsuez ol paper, was likely to be listened to. National interesta require us to keep our gold, and we cannot keeD it If there rhould be an increased Isse of paper. The measuro recommended could only be adopted in tho last extremitY. A necessary result of the state of things In Enzland nnd America Is a depresalon In the value of raw materials and colouia produce. Indeed, the faU of pricew must be genera', because the price of almost everything has been unduly high. Our manufacturers wil no doubt do all they can with prudence to keep their works going, although for very Umited houra This course Is called for by the Intere3ts of the working cles, as weu as of the manufactures 'themselves, where stoks are not already exceasve. Thi Is a tims 'calng for much patience, fortitude, liberality, and forbearance on tho part of the mercantUe oommualty and the bankers. The stress cannot possdbly be avoided, but itA effecta may be mitigated by prudence. Men must be coutent to resign sorme of tho lsrge profits of past years; but a few mnnoths will no doubt Eee us agaIn In a positlon to do business with advantage, though on a smauer scale and wit, grestor caution thau for some time back. We head yesterday a remnakabl proof of the genOral sounddnee With whlch buainess has boon done In LeedsO 0 the large amount of buls coming due on the 4th of November at the principal banks in thid town an extremely small proportOin-even lass thou the average In good tlme3-fallod to be duly met, The Bradford merchants and manufacturers had the good fortune to recelve their payments fom the United StAtes, for goods supplied to that market this fall, before the crisis In America came on; so that their po3ition Li immenuely bbettr than it would haye been If the Trans-atlantIc crash had come a mionth earlier." HUDDERSFIELD, Nov. 10. The market remains in the same quiet state as last week. Great cauttion is displayed by ptch3sor, and little is changing hands, either in the p lain, or fancy trade. A t the same time prices do act deeoje serious1y, and hopes of better markets at an early period are sanguainely entertained. Wools manifest a tendency to decline, especially Scotch wools.
AILWAY ZTXZLLIGENOC. I SAMBRE AND MEUSR The half-yearly meeting of this company washeldyestrday at the offices in Moorgate-street; Mr. W. P. Richards in the chair. Mr. M. CHUBB. the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which appeared in 2Ti Timnes of Monday. Mr. HARTRIDGE wished to know whether the directors would leave out the paragraph in the report relating to the committse's report, in wbich the directors remarked " that they did not engage in the coal trade without having consulted and received the approval of the shareholders, and they cannot but think the committee have not sufficiently studied the half yearly reports, or they would have seen that the charge they make is unfounded." He had taken the statement with respect to the directors having exceeded their powers in respect to the ooal trade from an account of the proceedings of a former meeting whioh appeared in .erepath's ,Tournal, in a reply by the chairman to a ques tion from a shareholder. The CHAIBRMAN said, the statement then made was in perfect accordance with the fact, as they had no power under the statutes to engage in the trade; but, so far as the aharo. holders were concerned, the directors had foiU power to develope that traffic in the best way they could, and the had also the assent of the shareholders to the courseadopted. It was his duty to move the adoption of the report, and in doing so he could add nothing material to the account given in Mr. Sheward's report in respect to the working of the line. He regretted that their exertions were not attended with more success, but he hoped that in the course of a short time they would find an improvement in their traffio. Owing to the great exertions of Mr. She ward the coal trade had increased their receipts by 17,0001. ; and although it had been carried on forsomeyears,and the transactions aumountedtol.tO,0001., not a single bad debt had been made. (Eear hear.) As stated at a former meeting, that arrangement had enablod them to divert some of the coal trade from the river, and bring it over the railway. The effect produoed had been useful to the company, and successful as an operation to improve the traffic. It had laid the foundation of a business which would be highly succossful in the end. The committee had not investigatedthis mattersufficiently. He was not partial to committees, for they were calculated to excite distrust between shareholders and directors. Before he proceeded further he would ask the aeocretary to read the report of the committee, in order that they might know what they were about. Mr. CHuBB then read the report of the committee of shareholders appointod at the general meeting on the 12th of May last. It stated that the committee were of opinion that the office of resident director should be, in an especial manner, controlled by the shareholders, and tho reamuneration made to depend to some extent upon successful management, and that whatever fixed salary may be determined upon as a part payment for his services the remainder should be made up by a percentage on gross receipts. The salary now annexed to the office was 5001. per annum, and 1001. out of l the allowance to the board of directors. There was also in addition a house provided for him, and partly furnished at the expense of the company. The committee had had no opportunity or occasion to consult Mr. Sheward, but they were informed that no further privileges were attached to the office, and that the present resident director was engaged in no other business than that of the compan ; and the committee thought it but fair to add that, in the casual inquiry made by them, they had discovered nothing to disturb the goodwill and confidence which had so long subsisted between the shareholders and the present resident director in Belgium. With regard to the coal trade, the committee remarked that the traffic upon the railway since the opening of the entire line had greatly disappointed the expectation of the directors, who had calculated upon a continuance of what had now proved to have been merely an exceptional prosperity in the trades carried on in the districts accommodated. The competition with the boatowners for the carrlage of coal had proved more formidable than was anticipated. The trade to be carried on by the railways from Charleroi over the Sambre and Meuse line to Vireux was so peculiarly of a local character, and the line itself a mere cul de sac, that it was scarcely reasonable to hope for a full development of the railway until some means be found to continne the line to the Ardennes Railway, and thus a through line of importance be established. After expressing their conviction that an agreement for the joint economical working of the Sambre and Meuse, the Charleroi and Louvain, and the Chatelineau and Morialm6 railways would be beneficia to them all, the committee state their opinion that the directors somewhat hastily engaged in the coal trade, without first obtaining the consent of the shareholders; and they oonsider that the whole question should have been previously submitted for debate and decision. The report was signed by Messrs. W. Hartridge, C. Von Roemer, and P. Marriott. The CHaAM sN said, it appeared to him that the com. mittee had upheld a foregone conclusion in their report without having instituted sufficient and proper inquiry. It was the business of the committee to investigate what appeared doubtful, but not to continue repeating errors, when they had only to examine former reports and ascertain the facts relating to the coal trade on the line. The matter was first suggested by Mr. Sheward in his half-yearly report, a conversation ensued on the subject at the meeting, and the proposition received general assent. At the next general meeting of the company a resolution was passed authorizng the directors to take the necessary steps to develope the coal traffic and protect the interests of the company. The directors were fuUy justified in the statement they had made in the report in respect to the committee of inquiry. He then explained that the negotiations for amalgamatlon and working arrangements with other companies had ended without coming to any agreement. IHe considered the retirement of Mr. Sheward from the office he held in Belgium was a great misfortune to the company A long discusslon ensued, in which Pr. Hartridge, Mr. Marriott, and other shareholders took part, In the course of which various statements, alleged rumours, and insinuations of rather a personal character, in respect of the managementof the company's affairs, were complotely refuted by the directors. Ar. SHEsVARD, the resident director, felt that a great deal of the personal matter had been levelled at him, but he had great pleasure now in resigning his trust, aud vvould have done so at the former meeting were it not for thea pointment of a committee of inquiry, who had,inhisopnion, made a very lame report. The honours 'hat had been conferred on him in Belginm were the best answers he could give to the unfounded allegations that had been made by one or two shareholders as to the manner in which he had performed his duty to the company. The coal trade had been carried on exclusively for the benefit of the company, and to protect their interests the trade must be continued. He now considered the company at its lowest point, and that any change must better its condition. The company was not in the bad state some of the shareholders had cndeavoured to represent, as they could pay all their debts. The 200,0001. bond debt guaranteed by the Govermnent could .not be called for; there was a sinking fund of 900L a-year for its redemption, and it would be cleared off in 58 years. About 35,0001. of 5I per cent. bonds vrould become due in July, 18i8, with which they would have no difficulty; and 105,0001. bonds would be due in 1863, to Mr. Brassey, and he believed they would have no difficulty in renewing them if necessary. He then explained the nature and objects of the negotiations promoted by the Louvaine Company for an amalgamation with the Sambre and Meuse, and which vere now broken off. Some of the largest preference shareholders in the company had been consulted on the scheme for au amalgamation, but they declared it impracticable. No doubt a saving would be effected by working the trafc of the two companies, which might be done as proposed, without an amalgamation. A fter some furth er explanations that appeared to be very satisfactory to the meeting the report of the directors was unanimously adopted. Ir. Austin was re-elected a director, and the vacancy at the board was reserved by consent of the meeting for Mr. Harrison. The meetLug was then made special to consider the prorosed amalgamation and working arrangement which were id on thoetable, and the proprietors expressed their approval of the course taken in respect thereof by the directors. A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings. TRAFIC RETURNS. fles Pas- Mer- Total. Total. Biiayl . open. suserm chandiBe. 1857. 1856. £i. £. £. £.i Week endia Oct 17.

T7. NEW1 BISRIJDGE AT CHELSEA. The corapletion of a bridge is a notch in the calendar of our metropolitan existence. Eow many things are dated from before the building of new London-bridge-what a tri umphant Hejira we shall have when we can date from the utter destruction of that hideous obstacle, Westminsterbridge I Chelsea, which has been agitating for its borough, Ias at last its bridge-a step towards it, perhaps, about 'which it cmn talk and date as much as it pleases. It is worth talkingandboastingo', too, for Chelsea-bridge when finished, as It will be next spring, wil be beyond aU doubt the handsomest structure of its kind in the metropolis. It is a long time since its erection was resolved on. The new park at Battersea had been receiving its f aU meed of Government support for some years, and the, scheme was therefore in the last stage of official abeyance, and likely to become extinct at any moment, when it was resolved to erect a new bridge to commaunicate with the new park, and afford the public an accommodation which had long been wanted at that part of the river. Mr. Page, the Government engineer, was accordingly instructed to prepare drawings and plans for a wooden suspension-bridge with brick towers, which he made and submitted to the consideration of the Metropolitan Improvement Commissioners. Afterwards there were designs prepared for a bridge of seven arches faced with stone, and for one in cast iron of five arches; but ulti. mately an iron suspensionx.bridge was agreed to, and the designs forthepresent structure determined on. We think none will be inclined to cavil at the choice of the commissioners. The new bridge is not only spacious and ample in its accoramodation for traffic, but in design the most elegant, in general effect the most light and ornamental, of all the bridges, whether suspended or otherwise, yet erected across the Thamea It is the kind of bridge, in fact, that seems to require bright summer skies and fertile landscapes to do justice to its graceful outlines. More than enough has been erected to enable the visitor to judge of the general tone of the design; but we needscarcely point out that the lightest and most decorative portions wiU be the last affixed) and that the beautiful. lanterns and muinarets which will surmount both towers and add so much to the general effect are still to be erected. The design of the whole is very novel. Two towers of castiron columnar framing support the chains andarches, orrather openings. These towers are cased inelaborate ornamental castings of open lattice work, like the casements of Eastern houses, and surmounted with the pointed minarets and lanterns we have already mentioned, and which give to the whole an inexpressively light and graceful effect. The cornice of the towers, the parapet of the bridge, and the light rail which divides the footpath from the road, are all of the same pleasing ornamental kind, and in keeping with the main features of the design. At each end of the bridge, however, are two octagon structures, on which (probably because of their intended use, for they are meant for toll-houses) none look with favour, and which in reality jar rather with the rest of the structure. In spite of terra cotta pinnacles and little spires, they persist in retaining the strongest resemblance to pepper-castors of mediLeval form. So much for the general aspeot of the bridge; for its position we need only say that it stretches from the Middlesex side from the centre of that debatable land where Chelsea ends and Pimlico begins to Battersea on the Surrey side, where It overlooks the new park on the right, and the ground where the Crystal Palace Company are making believe to build a "west end" station on the left. Between the river walls at Trinity high-water line tho total length of the bridge is 704 feet, of which the centre arch or opening is 333 feet, and the two side openings 1663 feet each. The width of the bridge for traffic is 47 feet-that is, a carriage way of 32 feet and two footwaya of 7 feet 6 inches each. The piers upon which the towers are built and suspension chains hung are each 88 feet in length and 19 in width, and terminate in curved cuttwaters 7 feet 6 inches above the level of hlghwater mark. The foundations of these piers are precisely similar to those which are at present being formed for the arches of new Westminster-bridge, and dispense entirely with massive and costly piers of masonry and also with coffer dams. They consist of timber piles of unusual size, driven deep into the London clay far below the bed of the river at intervals of three feet over the entire area of the piers, and cut off at low-water level. The external surface of the piers Is formed by cast iron main piles of 12 inches diameter and 27 feet long, driven 20 feet below low-water mark, and between these cast iron plates are driven so as to protect on all sides the bearing piles by a metaUic casing. The space thus enclosed is then dredged to the hard stratum of gravel above the clay, filled in with solid concrete, aud the whole secured by wrought iron tie bars. On the bearing pile is a flooring of solid stone bedded on the concrete; ali the caisson above low water is lined with brickwork, and the cutwaters at each end where exposed to constant shocks from drifting vessels aTe built of solid brickwork. The cast iron columnar towers which rise on these piers to support the ohains are strongly braced both vertically and horizontally. Their present height is about 60 feet from high water mark, though when entirely finished with lanterns and pinnacles they will rise to at least 100. These towers, exclusive of the ornamental casing, weigh 350 tons, and they have from the weight of the b-idge Itself a pressure of 1i tons, and when loaded a pressure ef 3i tons per square inch. Only two suspension chains are used, each of which from mooring to mooring is 920 feet long and weighs about 350 tons. These chains are technically divided into threoportions-nasnely,the moor. ing chain, or the parts at each end which are buried in solid masonry; the back chains, or lengths which stretch from the ground to the towers; and the main chains, which cross the centre from tower to tower. The chain is made In long links, and each link is formed of seven and eight bars alter. nately. The bars are 16 feet and 16 feet 9 inches long, 8 inches deep, and nearly an inch in thickness. Each of these bars was tested before it was allowed to be fixed to the enormous pressure of 13& tons the square inch, or upwards of 100 tons the bar, and no bar was used the permanent extension of which exceeded 1-400th of an inch to the foot. There are 56 links of six, seven, and eight bars each employed in the mooring-chains at Chelsea; 96links of sevesi and eight bars each in the back chains, and 92 links of seven and eight bars each in the main chains, giving 244 links of 1,936 bars in alL The sectional area of the chains at the centre of the bridge is 212 square inches, which gradualy increases In proportion to the strain towards the towers, where it is 226. The suspension rods passing from the chains to the roadway of the bridges are 2 inches in diameter and placed 8 feet apart. They have a joint at each extremity, the upper one allowing a motion parallel with the chains and the lower a transverse motion, At the ceontre opening of the bridge the roadway is 24 feet 6 inches above high water mark, and above low water 41 feet. The whole roadway has a rise of 18 inches from the land moorings to the centre. Two wrought iron longitudinal lattice girders extendjthe entire length of the bridge, and are secured to the suspension rods to which the trans. verse girders supporting the carriageway are also bolted These girders are 87 in numbar. They are formed of boiler. plate strengthened with angle iron, and are 32 feet long by 2 feet Sinches deep, and weigh 32 cwt. each. Between these girders pass wrought iron bearings, to which are bolted plates of iron of the same material which forms the roadway. On the upper surface these plates are covered with bitumen, over which are laid compressed slabs of asphalte and cork cuttings. This forms the bed for a wood pavement of blocks of ship oak, which are again coated over with asphalte and the paved surface of the road completed. This pavement is probably the lightest and most durable that has ever yet been used for such a purpose. The footways ere formed of the same wood pavement set in bitumen; and next to the footways on each side of the bridge a tramway has been laid on oak beams covered with plate Iron for such heavy traffic as may use the bridge. I Such is a brief general outline of the proportions of the new bridge at Chelsea, all the detailsof which have been admirably carried out by the contractors, Messrs. Young and Co. In a brief period it will be opened for traffic. In point of usefulness and accommodation few of our metro. politan bridges are superior to it ; in architectural beauty it will, beyond all doubt, rank first. Yet the whole cost of this bridge up to the present time has only amounted to 88,0001., or 21. 2s. 5d. the square foot of surface. This, as compared with our other bridges, is quite a marvel of cheapness, as our readers may see. For instance, according to Hunmber's admirable treatise on bridges, the cost of Lon. don-bridge was 542,1501., or at the rate of 111. 6s. the square foot of surfawe. Southwark.bridge cost 384,0001., or Ill. 5s. 10d. the superficial foot ; Blackfrlars cost only 31. lSs. 6d. the foot, or 157,0001. in all; Waterloo, the largest by nearly 8, 000 superficial feet, cost 579,9151., or 101. the foot; Hungerford, 41. 16s. Gd. the foot, or 98,7601., Westminster, 71. 16s. the superficial foot, or 389,5001.; Vauxhall.bridge, nearly the most unsightly obstruction on the river, actualy cost 91. 16s. the square foot of surface, or 300,O0OI. * while Chelsea, as we have said, only cost 21. 23. 5d. -Newv West. minster-bridge, taken at the sum named in Sir William Molesworth's report-viz., 235,0001.-will cost 21. 8s. 6d. per foot superficial, It will be seen from this that, notwithstanding the ornamental character of Chelsea.bridge and the high quality of its iron, it is, as compared with the cost and area of other bridges, infinitely more economical, Tbus compared with London and Southwark bridges its cost per foot superficia is as 21. 3s. to 111. 6s. ; compared with Waterloo as 21. 3s. to 101.; compared with VauxhaU as 21. 3s. to 91.16s. ; showving beyond a doubt the great extent of bridge accommodation of a highly ornamental character which may under difficult circumstances be economicaUy obtained.

LAW BEPO11V. (lorTpm (),p ruA'M-- THE PREFERENCE SHAEIIOLDERS OF THE GREAT 'OETIEERN RATAVAV (fM-PA1V HlEN?RY AND OTHERS V. THE GREAT NORTHERX RAILWAY OMNfPAIV . - - -> - -o n, -5V. AV. (Before the LORD CHANCEUOR and the LORDS JUST1CiS of APPFA T. I This part-heard appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Wood was this morning resumed. The question involved is one of the utmost importance to the preference shareholders of the company as affecting the value of their shares, and pecuniarily interests themu to the extent of 85,0004 The net revenue of the company applicable to dividend for the half-year ending the 31st of December, 1856, was 243,9231. 5s. 8d., and of this sum 85,0001. would. under ordinary circumstances, have gone to pay the dividends on the preference shares of the company. The loss, however, sustained by the company through the frauds of Leopold Redpath amounted to nearly the sum applicable to dividend, and the directors, In order to free the company from its per plexed condition through the valid and forged stock being -mixed together, obtained an Act of Parliament in August last requiring them to apply the above-mentioned 243,923. 5s. Sd. in paying the loss incurred by the company through thefraudsof Redpath. Thiswasdone, andthe trifling balance that remained was wholly inadequate for the paymentof thedividends onthepreference shares. Under these circumstances, when the time arrived for declaring another dividend in July last the preference shareholders claimed to be paid their full dividends from June, 1856, before any portion of the company's revenue was appropriated towards a dividend on the ordinary stock of the company, and filed their bill to obtain a declaration to that effect. The ViceChancellor made a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill; hence the present appeal. The first question iswhat are the rights of the preference shareholders under the several Acts of Parliament authorizing their creation? Are they entitled to bepaid their fixed dividends per annum in full out of a second half-yearly dividend when the profits for the first half-year were insufficient for the payment of their half-yearly fixed dividends ? The second question is-to what extent are the preference shareholders affected by the Act of last session, requiring the directors to apply the revenue applicable to dividend for the half-year ending Decermber the 31st, 1856, to make good the loss sustained by the company ? The ATroRNEY.GEhXERAL, for the appellants, stated that the preference shares of the company amounted to over 3,000,0001., and the ordinary shares to above 4,000,000'. Were such a large number of persons-namely, the preference shareholders, who had a common interest in the company with the ordinary shareholders, not to bear their proportionate share in a common loss ? He should apprehend they were bound to do so. In none of the Acts creating these preference shares was there to be found any clause guaranteeing a dividend. All that was secured to the preference shareholders was a priority for the payment of their dividends from time to time out of the profits of the company, if there were any profits. There was nothing in any of the Acts of Parliament that gave the preference sbareholders any dight to gay, " Give us out of the profits of 1857 the dividend we were not able to get out of the profits of 1856." The requirements of the various Acts as to the payment of dividends to the preference shareholders were fulfilled by the directors dividing the profits, so far as they would extend, between the preference shareholders. There existed no contractbetween the parties that there should be a certain amount of revenue applicable to dividend, but only that the preference shareholders should be paid their dividends In priority out of the profits, provided there were any. He now came to the Act of last sessien, which freed the matter from all doubt. The preference shareholders could not, unider the circumstances that had arisen, have received any dividend except under the authority of that Aot. Previous to the passing of that Act the 243,9231.5 s. 8d. was no man's money, for, in consequence of the amount of spurious stock that was mixed up with and undistinguisbable from the valid stock, it was impossible to say to whom this monoy belonged. The object of that Act was to enable the company, through their directors, to deal with the amount in a particular way,which plainly evinced that the Legislature intended all the shareholders of the company to contribute pro X atd towards their common loss. That Act absolutely and finaUy disposed of the money, and made the calemity which bad befallen the company, and was common to all, fall upon all the members of the company alike. It was a mistake to suppose that the preference shareholders were creditors of the company. They were partners, and therefore liable to bear their fair share In the losses and misfortunes of the company. Irrespective of the Act of August, 1857, the preference shareholders could not have claimed the payment of any dividend, inasmuch as the good and bad stook being mixed together rendered it impossible to declare any dividend ; and that Act gave the preference shareholders no right anterior to the beginning of the present year. The 3d section of the Act was a Parliamentary disposition of the 243,9231. 5s. 8d and was binding upon all parties. The Legislature was web aware at the time of the passing of the Act that the sum proposed to be dealt with was more than sufficient to pay the claims of the preference shareholders, and yet it authorized the application of the money to a totally different purpose. This clause exonerated the directors, and concluded the preference shareholders from making any claim for dividend on the half-year ending in December, 1866, except out of the surplus that might remain after payment of the company's less. Lord Justice K?incsT BRUCE.-lt strikes me that the remedy in this case is, as it frequently happens to be in other cases, worse than the disease. The Act of Parliament seems a very dreadful affair, construe it whichever way you will-that is, if you can construe it at all. The ATToRNeY-GENFRAL, in continuation.-The plain. tiffs' claim at the hands of the Court Is no less than a probibition to the directors from declaring any dividend whatever until the preference shareholders shall have been satisfied a full year's dividend from July, 1856, to July, 1857. "ow, It Is out of the question that the preference shareholders should be paid this claim in full, and at the same time have the benefit of the 3d section of the Act of last session. To exempt the preference shareholders from any share in the company's losses would be to treatthem ascreditors,when, in point of fact, they were partners, and to grant their claim would be to ignore altogether an Act of Parliament; on these grounds he would submit that the judgment of the Court below could not stand. Mr. ROLT and Mr. DEinsol foilowed on the same aide, and in addition urged, by reference to other raUiway Acts of arliament, that preference shares were not entitled to arrears unless special provision was made to that effect. The LoiRD (;HCELLOR.-My difficulty is that I am ed upon to decide a question of law as to what is the meaning of preference shares, I do not feel myself competent to decide what are the incidents and advantages belonging to preference shares. T he case was not concluded.
ROLLS' COURT. (ITTA AVT_T. , NT- n SWINFE:N V. S\VTNVFV (Before aeRASTF.R Of fh. RrT.r.c I The MASTER of the ROLLS gave judgment in this case, in which the question raised was how far the princlpal to a suit or action could be bound by a compromise entered into 'without her consent by her counsel, with or without the tacit, implied, or expressed authority of her attorney ? The question arose out of a compromise entered into by Sir Frederic Thesiger in March, 1856, on behalf of the defendant, Mlrs. Swinfen, of Swinfen-hall, Stafford, which compromise that lady subsequently repudiated and refused to be bound by. The facts of the case have, on two or three occasions been fully reported, and were recapitulated in Thte Times of Monday last, and the alternative prayer now made to the Court was either that Mrs. Swinfen sbhould he declared bound inequity to accept and carry out the compromise, or that a new trial at law should be directed for the case to be again heard on its merits. His Honour was of opinion that no case had been made out for specific performance of the compromise entered into by Sir Frederic Thesiger; bht the case must again be sent back to a law court to try the issue deviasit ve non, as previously directed. The compromise in dispute had unquestionably been entered into without the consent of Mrs. Swinfen, and it could never be contended that the consent of her attorney (even if given to it) witbout her concurrence was to debar her Irom its repudiation. An attorney had no power to make any such arrangement without his client's direct approval, muoh less against her expressed instructions; and this Court was most tenacious of the interest of suitors in this respect. When counsel gave their consent to arrangements made in court it was always assumed that such arrangements were made upon the instruction of the attorney and the concurrence of the principal, and to countenauce any deviation from this assumption would be most dangerous and unwise. It was said that Mrs. Swinfen by not earlier repudiating the arrangement of her counsel must be taken to have acquiesced in it, and that, although she did not hear of the compromise until after the case was disposed of by a juror being withdrawn, she ought to have immediately gone into court and insisted on the case being reopened and continued. But, considering the position and natural inexperience of Mr Swinfen in these matters, such a contention could scarcely he entertained, since very few counsel would have been confident enough to advise such a proceeding, and have urged a client to stake the Issue of her case upon so interrupted a hearing. Considering also that the solicitors on the other side were within a fortnight after the alleged compromise had been entered into informed that MIrs. Swinfen bad never consented to, nor would ba bound by it, and taking in consideration also the fact that Mrs. Swinfen had from the first declared that she would have nothing to do with it, the Court could not hold her either to have originally agreed to or subsequently anquiesced in it. The present biU for specific performance would be dismissed without costs. A new trial would be directed at law, andthe usual decree made for administration. TheCourt at the same time would earnestly impress upon the parties interested in the suit the advisability of coming to some compromise as to their respective rights otherwise much, if not all, of the property which they mightmutuallybenefit In would probably he wasted in litigatton, and neither the oneparty nor the other getanything out of the sui' but continuous disappointment. The Atterney-General, Mr, R. Palmer, Mr. T. Terrell Mr ennedy (of the common law bar), MIr. Cole, Mr. Elob house, Mr. Farrer, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Batemnan appeared in the case.
VICE-ECANCprOTT.qs r m - -- - I I (Before V ,,h - .±UY. 'U. This was a suit by th"' x- lt o Clinton Roberson for tie executor of the nte Mr. Jo3eph for that purpose contained in a mortgage deed from Mr. J* C. Robertson, in the year 1841, of two shares then held by him in the Rai2way Times. The case occupied the Court y esterday and to-day, and Is not yet concluded. Mr. Malins and Mr. Henry Stevens appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bacon and Mr. Piggott for the defendants. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WOOD.) HANSON V. REECE. This was a bill for the purpose of obtaining payment from the defendant, a solicitor, of 1911, 17s. 6d., being the amount of a check held by him under a mersorandum of agreement between one Foster, of whom the defendant was solicitor, and the plaintiff, Certain transactions and dealings had taken place between the plaintiff Hanson and Foster, and in March, 1856, Foster had caused a trader debtor summons to be issued against Elanson out of the Birmingham District Bankruptcy Court for the sum of 3391. 9s. 10d. On the 10th of March, 1856, Foster brought an action against Hanson in the Court of Exchequer to recover this sum of 3391. 9s. 10d. It was shortly afterwards agreed between the parties that the bankruptcy proceedings instituted by Foster against Hanson should be dlscGntinued and that an order of the Birmingham Court, requiring Hanson to enter into a bend to answer the amount to be recovered In the action, should be discharged upon certain terms embodied in a memorandum of agreement, One of these terms was that a cheek for payment of 1911. 17s. 6d. should be handed to Reece, as solicitor of Foster, and applied by him in payment of any such amount as might be recovered b; Foster in the action against Hanson. A further cneck for 261. was to be given. to be applied towards the costs recovered by Foster in such action. An undertaking was given that there should be funds to meet the checks, and that payment from the bank should not under any circumstances be stopped. In case of verdict for the defendant (Hlanson) Reece was to return the two checks upon receiving6Z. for the bankruptcy costs, and also the costs of any issue found for the plaintiff. The checks were deposited with Rleece pursuant to the agreement, and the order of the Birmingham Court of Bankruptcy was rescinded. Foster declared in his action for 40o0. damages, his claim being to recover the sum of 1911. 17s, 6d. A verdict was taken by consent for the amount claimed, sub. ject to a reference to arbitration. By the award of the arbitrator, made on the 10th of May, 1856, the amount claimedwas reduced to 1031. 16s. 7d., Hason being also ordered to pay Focter the costs ef the reference. Judg. ment was entered up in the action by Foster for the sum thus found to be due to him by the award and the oosts. Certain demands by way of set-off having been made by Hanson against Poster, the latter presented a petition in the Bankruptcy Court for protection from process. Hlanson attended before the commissioner, and his set-off against the judgment debt was admitted to proofthe checks held by Reece having been presented by him for payment after the decision of the Commisioner, the balance after payment of the judgment debt and the costs of the reference was tendered by him to Hanson's solicitor. The tender was refused on the part of Hanson, and this bill had been filed against Reece to recover the whole amotunt of the check from Reece, who insisted that he was entitled to retain 881. towards payment of his lien for cost. The plaintiffs contended that the judgment debt had been in effect satisfied by the set-off admitted in bankruptcy; that the judgment was not completed until after the bankruptcy, and that the defendant was not entitled to present the check until the amount recoverable in the bankruptcy was ascertained, and that his alleged lien was subject to the ri hts and equities of the parties. TsIr. Rolt and Mr. Chapman Barber were for the plaittiff, Mr. Cairns and Mr. Eddis for the defendant. The VIcE-CmsAycELLoR, after adverting to the fats of the case at some length said that the checks had been deposited with Reece to be appropriated for particular pur. poses, and were subject to his lien for costs. The security thus placed in the hands of Reece could not be affected by anything which had taken place under the bankruptcy, nor had there been any decision as against hima by the Commissioner, or the exercise of any jurisdiction as to the check, or in the way of arresting its application to the specific purposes for which it was given. He did not, moreover, think that any order of the Commissioners could pre.cdice the right of Reece to receive the lien due to him for his costs. So much money had been deposited in his hands to abide a certain event. It would not have been competent for the plaintiff to have filed a bill to recover these checks on the ground of his abandoning all right under the agreement. The matter remained unaffected by the proceedings in bankruptcy, and the bil must be dismissed with costs. PA.REBROTHEE V. AKETTLL The plaintiff in this case sought to obtain an assignment from the defendant of certain letters patent for improve. ments in the purifying whale, seal, and other oils by distilation, according to the terms of a memorandum of agree. ment dated ehe 22d of February, 1855, and generally specfic performance of the agreement. It appeared that in January, 1855, the defendant, who was a morking mechanic, applied to the plaintiff to assist him in obtaining a patent for an improved method of purifying oils, and also to become the purchaserof the patent, and join the defendant in working the same. A memorandum of agreement dated the 22d of February, was arawn up by the defendant and signed by the plaintiff By this memorandum, which recited that Peter ArkeU (the defendant) had discovered improvements in the purifying of whale and other oils, and was desirous of carrying out these inventions or improvements, he agreed that if the plaintiff engaged to pay the entire expense of obtaining a patent for England and the colonies he would, on obtaining such patent, ass4n the same to the plhintiff his exectttore, admimnistrators, and assignS on the receipt of 1001. It was further agreed that Farebrother should pay Arkell 41. a-week during the erection of proper machinery, the plaintiff engaging to allow buildings, machinery, or apparatus sufficient for the due carrying out of the said patent, so that the defendant should not receive damage or loss for the want of such appaatus as should be necessary foreffectuaUr workng the same. It was also agreed that the defendant should receive a bonus of 10 per cent. on the value received by licenses granted. The plaintiff was also to insure the defendant's life for 2501., and pay the premiums. The defendant also agreed to use the best of his skiU as an engl. neer in designing and erectng the necessary machinery, and also to devote his best energy to the superintending and working the same, he undertaking to instruct some inteligent person appointed by the plaintiff in the whole art and mystery of the same; as also any further improvements he might practically discover in the further progress of the operation, so that the plaintiff should not receive lose or damage in case of illness or accident to ArkeL Farcbrother also bound himself to provide the raw or crude oilsin quantities necessary for such purification, and to pay ArkeU 31. per ton for every ton so purified by Arkell, or under his superintendence. When the quantity of manu. ractured oil should exceed two tons per week the payment of 41. per week to cease. The bill stated that the patent was obtained in 1855. the expenses being paid by the plain. tiff, who had also paid the defendant the 1001. as the purchase-money for the patent. Certain premises at Stockwell belonging to the plaintiff were appropriated for the purposes of the patent business, and at the request of the deffend ant a silver still was constructed and plant purchased for the purpose of the patent process at an expense of 3501. The sum of 41. per week had been paid to the defendant, and an assurance had been effected upon his life. The plaintiff had agreed to assign his interest in the patent, subjeet to the agreement with Arkell, to certain parties for 5,0001. and other considerations, provision being expressed to be made for securing to the defendant the benefits to which he was entitled under the agreement of February, 18-55. The agreement to assign was partialy carried out by an indenture, dated the 16th of February, 1856; but the defendant had refused to execute the assignment, and persisted in his refusal, The plaintiff, under these circumstances, had filed his bill to compel the defendant to assign the Iotters pstont to him, pursuant to the terms of the memoran,dum of agreement, and generally to obtain specific performance thereof. hir. JESSEii (Mr. Rolt with him), for the plaintiff, con. tended that even if the Court should feel a difficulty as to granting specific performance of the whole agreement, the ortion as to the assignment of the patent to the plaintiff zor 100I was a distinct term, and was a transaction alto. gether apart and separate from the other terms of the agreement, relating to the mode of carrying on the patent business, so that the Court could compel the assignment to the plaintiff, who had paid the consideration money, and reject the subeequent part of the agreement. Mr. CAIRNS and Mr. DREwnY, for the defendant, con. tended that the agreement was one of which the Courtcould not perform specific performance. They also contended, upon the question of costs, that the plaintiff had not performed his part of the agreement, that adequate premises and materials for working the patent had not been supplied, and that only 90. of the 1001, had been paid by the plaintiff. The VicE-CHrAtcELLoi, who had already intimated that he could not decree specific performauce of the agreement said that he would give his judgment to-morrow (this3 morning.
[ COURT or, O1R.N iRpvTT XT- IA 1lEITFUMlMV A?Th A'P,rI V - (StingS in Banco, before Lord CAMPBELL and Jru.sica COLERIDGE, WIGHTrN, and ERLE. This was an action in whioh the plaintiffs sought to re. cover the value of a quantity of hemp which had been sold by them to a Mr. Horne, a ropemakeriat Sunderland. When the goods arrived Horne was on the eve of insolvency, and sent word to the wharf that the goods were not to be delivered. Bat in the meantime a quantity of the goods were delivered in his yard, and, as it was snowy weather, he gave instructions that they should be placed under cover in his warehouse. Having determined to stop, and assign his property to the defendant as trustee, he wished to return the goods to the plaintiffs, but he was advised by his solicitor that he could not legally do so. He, therefore, wrote a letter to the plaintiffs on the 4th of February, expressing his regret for what had occurred, and explaining the particulars. The plaintiffs immediately, on the 6th of the same month, demanded possession of the goods from Horne, but he referred the demandant to his attorney, who refused to deliver them up. The question was thus raised at the trial, whether the goods had, under the circumstances, vested in the insolvent so as to pass to the defendant, his assignee; or whether the property in the goods stiU remained in the plaintiffs, either because the contract had been rescinded by consent, or by a stoppage in transitu. At the trial Mr. Justice Wightman directed a verdict to be entered for the plaintiffs, but reserved the question for the decision of the Court. A rule to enter the verdict for the defendant was accordingly granted. mr. GRovE, Q.C., and mr. HE:NDERSO yesterday showed cause against the rule, which was supported by Mr. H. Hill, Q.C., and MIr. Murray. Lord CAMPBELL now said, that from feelings of justice he was predisposed to decide in favour of the plamtiffs. They had sold their goods, for which they had not been paid, and the purchaser was anxious to do what was fair and honourable, and to rescind the contract. It was certainly hard that a biU should not be accepted and payment made, but that the plaintiffs should be deprived of their goods. Unfortunately, that could not be done consistently with the rules of law, and therefore judgment must be given for the defendant. The property in the goods vested in Home, subject to the consignor's right of stoppage in transitu, or the insolvency of 1orne. The property might havo bgor. diverted hgnt 1orneu-Jint, by the reoNLign O9 the contract, or, secondly, by the stoppage of the goods in transitu. In the fsst place, the contract could not be rescinded by mutual consent, and it was sufficient to say that in his letter of the 4th of February Horne offered to rescind, If he did make the offer he still had the power to withdraw it; and on the 6th, when the demand of rhe goods was made, he naturally changed his mind and refused, when he said he should be governed by the advice of his solicitor. The property therefore remained in him secondly, had the right of stoppge in transitu been exercised? That woald depend on whether the goods were still in tran4iiu on the 6th of February. The mere delivery of the goods and putting them on the premises of Horne was not a termination of the traznsitu. Bat Horne assented to their remaining ere, an herefore It could not be said that they were not in his possession. The plaintiffs case therefore failed on bOth grounds. The other judges expressed similar opinions. ule absolute, to enter verdict for the defendant. WADLOW V. RIDES. This was an appeal from the decsion of the judge of a County Court. The action was brought to recover the valne of a brown mare. Themare in queation had been delivered to a person named Grover upon the terms that he should have two days to try her, and that on the expiration of that tf me he shotld be at liberty to keep the mare at a certain -or ce,r to return it to the plaintiff at the Saracen's Head In, Eeterborough. The mare was not returned nor the money paid, but in the meantime it was sold in market overt to a man named Meekng, by whom it was sold, not in market overt, to the defendant. The judge of theCounty Court decided that the right of property rested in the defendant and gave judgment in his favour. Mr. RzAsx now contended that, though the plaintiff had parted with the possession, he had not parted with the property in the mare. The possession had been obtained bv a trick, animo furand4, and consequently the property still remained in the plaintiff. The COURT thought there had been a sale of the mare upon the condition that the purchaser should he at liberty to return it if he thought proper, but that the plaintiff, having parted with the property, had no right to recover it bJeck. Judgment affirmed, with costs

INSOL TENT DEBTORS' COUBT, Nov. 10. IN RE T. IL BUIXTO\. (Before Mfr. Commisioner lvrnRpTTv I This tnsolvent, whose case has been reported on former occaions, appeared for judgment. He was opposed by several poor persons who had deposited small sums of money in the City of London Deposit Bank, of which the insolvernt had been a director. That concern had failed in consequence, as was alleged, of the misconduct of the secretary, who had absconded with funds belonging to the society. Mr. Commissoner MURPHY ras of opinion tbat, although the insolvent had not been guilty of fraud, yet by his negli. gence as a director he had permitted the fraud of the secretary, whereby the poor persons who had been led by the temptation of 5 per cent, interest to intrast their savings to the City of London Deposit Bank had lost their little fortunes. Upon account of this negligent omission, which had been so injurious to the opposing creditors, the insolvent would be discharged after the lapse of slx months from the vesting order under the discretionar y clause.

POLICE. MAtsIoN-.oUs.-John Grace Leveridge, a respectablelooking young man, clerk to Mr. W. Oldham, a wine merchant in Londonastreet, was brought before the LORD MYyoR, charged with embezzling the moneys of his employer. Mfr. Lewis, jun., appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Hobler for the prisoner. Theprosecutor$havingbeensworn,said,-The prisoner,who Was in my service as clerk, was authorized to receive money on my account, and it was his dutyto pay it into my bankers. On the 4th of November inst. I gave him a check for 311. 12s. 2d. to pay the duty upon a butt of wine. The check has been returned to me by my banaers as paid. The prisoner has absented himself from my counting-house since Saturday last, and suspecting that he had been embezzling my money I yesterday broke open his desk. I have ascertained at the Custom-house that the butt of wine has not been removed, and the duty has not been paid. This is only one out of a great many charges that I have to bring against the prisoner, and I ask for a remand to enaole me to complete it. Mr. Hobler applied that his client might be admitted to haiL. The LORD MAYOR refused the application, and the prisoner was remanded. His LORDSHIP was engaged for several hours in bearing charges against persons, principally beys, of picking pockets and of attempted street robbery during the procession on the Preceding day. The prisoners were sentenced to periods o°f impristonmenet with hard labour ranging from 21 days to The LORD MAYOR thankfuly acknowledged the receipt of a check for 5 guineas from the Worshipful Company of Scriveners, as a donation to the poor-box. GVUILDZU.-There were several cases of picking pockets arisng out of the proceedings of Lord Mayor's day, some of wih were disposed of summarily by short terms of im- prisonineut; and one in which a prisoner named Eagar was charged with stealing a gentleman's watch from his pereon, and was committed for trial, there having been a former conviction against him. MARYLEBO XM-Henry Harris, aged 19, was placed at the bar on remand, charged with having on the 29th of September stabbed a man na.ned George Stake, living at 38, Adamstreet west, Marylebone. It appeared that on the morning of the day alluded to prosecutor, while walking along the Edgware-road, asked the prisoner what o'clock it was, when, instead of giving the required Information, he made use of a most vulgar expression, and on his being remonstrated with for so doing he drew forth a knife with which he inflicted several wounds upon various parts of prosecutor's person - he (prosecutor) was removed to St. Mary's Hospita, and ad been under medical treatment ever since, owing to the serious injuries which he had received. The prisoner was fuOly committed to take his trial at the neit sessions of the Central Criminal Court for " cutting and wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm." CLlRRENWELL.-A gentlemanly dressed man, about 50 years oE age, with a proftuion of hair about his face, who gave the name of John Hubert Heath, describing himself as a gentleman residing at Wood-green, Tottenham, was charged with being drunk, disorderly, and creating a disturbance in a railway carriage on the Great Northern Railway, and, further, with inteifering with the officers 'f the railway at the Hornsey station. Mr. Thomas Williams, the superintendent of the company's line, attended to watch the case. btWhen one of the passenger trains was proceeding along beween Hololoway and Hornacy the guards and passengers were much alarmed at hearing loud screams of" Murder ' and 'Police !" prooeedinz from one of the carriages. As soon aS As PQeible thy train wai Jrouht to a standstill, and thwe nise and streams continuing the passengers all left their carriages, and it being dark, and a train nearly due, much danger was incurred. When Clayer, the guard, want to the carriage from which the noises were proceeding he found the defendant, who was very drunk and much excited, fighting with the other passengers. He asked him to leave the carriage quietly, but he refused, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he could get him out and pat him In the break with himself. The defendant was very noisy, and when the tran reached the Hornsey station he was put out, and although Mr. Crosby, the stationmaster, asked him several times to go away quietly he would not do so, but made such a noise and confusion thst business was for some time brought to a standstill. Altogether the train was delayed two or three minutes, which was a very serious affair. The bylaws of the company were produced by Mr. Wil. liams, and one of them ran as follows*- " Any person found In a cariage or station in a state of intoxiea tIon, or oDmmitting any nisance orothwwise wilully tnterfering with the oDmfort of other jirengezr Its hereby flubjected to a penalty not exceeding 40s, and ie Immetely, or at the fret opportunity, be semoved from the coDmpany's Premises. The defendant, In reply to the charge, said he was very sorry for what he had done. The fact was, he was a little the worse for liquor, and when he and his wife got into the carriage a person was smoking, and, having asked him to desist, and he refusing, he certainly did knock the pipe out of his mouth, which was the cause of the disturbance. Wfhen he got out at the Hornsey station he was very much excited, but having been incarcerated the whole night, he hoped the magistrate would conidoer that, with an apology, a sufficient punishment. Mr. Coiuux, having looked over the bylaws of the company, fined the deFendant the full Penalty of 40s. or in default of payment one month in the Eouse of Correction. Thoraas Harding, aged 23, residing at 28, Sidney-atreet, St. Luke's, a jeweller, was charged with stealing about 6 dwt. of gold filinga of the value of 13a. 6d., the Property of Mr. W. W.

TATs Sa-A seaman, who gave the name of Charles Yates, entered the wltness-box and said he particularly wished to make a statement of the cruelty exercised towards him on hoard an American ship. Mr. Szw7.-At sea The applicant.-Yes, Sir, on a voyage from New York to London. Mr. S EL said that he had no jurisdiction over offences committed on board American ships at sea, and if English seameni would place themselves out of the protection of their own flag the law of this country would not apply to them. If the applicant had been strack in a British port he could obtain reress here. The Applicant said he had been struck and very shamefully used on board an American ship at LiverpooL Mr. Sxr. said he had no jurisdiction over offences committed at Liverpool, whether they were on board English or American ships. The applicant ought to have waited on Mr. Mansfield, the stipen=iary magistrate at Liverpool, who would have listeneil to his statement and, if necessary, granted a summons or warrant. He had repetesdly to listen to statements of ilnusage on board American ships on the high seae and he believed that great tyranny had been too often practised on board the vesseLs of that country, both to American and other seamen of all nations. The applicant said that he wished to caution his countrymen agunst joining American shlis, for the laws of this country, It seemted, had no jurisdiction over them if offenoes were committed on the high seast and It was Impossible to obtain any redress if the party njured were in any port of the United States.

WAADsWORTL-Henry Zachariah Jervis-who, it wiUbe remembered, represented that he was the son of Sir John Jervis, and brother-in-law to the Turkih Ambassador-was bronght up on remand before Mr. LNos.yc^, charged with obtaining money from Mrs. Sarah Parker, who is upwards of 70 years of age, and alleged to be insane, by false representations. On this occasion it was stated in court that the prisoner was very well known, and had not taken up his certificate as solicitor for some years. He appeared much better in health, and stood the whole time he was in the dock. The prisoner, upon being brought into the court, wishod for the case to be adjourned for the attendance of his solicitor, who had all his papers, and who understood he was remanded until Wednesday, and not Tu'esday, Mr. Taylor, the chief clerk, said, it was distinctly understood that Tuesday was the time for the re-examination. The solicitor whom the prisoner had employed was in the court at the time and heard the day appointed. Payne, the summoning officer, said, Wednesday was first mentioned, but in consequenoe of the witness (Efrs. Boughton) not being able to leave the Canoer Hospital, where she was an inmate, upon a Wednesday, the case was adjourned until Tuesday. Mr. INGnAx decided upon hearing the fresh evidence, and told the prisoner that it would not prevent him from having the witnesses cross-examined on another day. The prisoner hoped it would be no longer than to-morrow (this day), as he wished to obtain his liberty. Mrs. Mary Ann Grist, a married woman, was then called, and stated that she was niece to Mrs. Parker, end now resided at No. 45, London-road. She was living with her aunt in September last. She remembered opening the door to the prisoner on a Tuesday night in that month. He addressed Mrs. Parker as "My dear madam," and asked her If she had made her will. Her aunt replied in the negative, and he told her that she had better make her wiU as her family would take all the property. Witness told him distinctly that her aunt had no property, ner had she ever had a child. The prisoner replied that it was false, and asserted that there was plenty of property. He accused witness of being in league with her friends to rob her aunt, and that she had drawn large sums from the Bank. She told him not to have anything to do with her aunt for it would be no better than swindling. He then told witness that he would punish lher for her insolence. The next day ber aunt accused her of having given her poison, and also of robbing her. Witness was with her aunt for five weeks to take care of her, and she at first treated her very kindly, but after the prisoner said witness was a dangerous person she quite altered in her behaviour. She always considered her aunt to be deranged. Mir. Samuel Neagus, the brother of Mrs. rarker, residing at Bury St. Edmunds, said, his sister was the widow of a stockbroker, and lar only income was 40& per annum from the funds of the Stock-Exchange. His sister had the lease of a house in Sloane-street, but that had expired some time. Witness had never seen the prisoner untU that morning in court. He never came to Bury St. Edmunds. His sister never had any family to his knowledge. She had been deranged for years, and it was above 40 years ago that she threw herself from a bedroom window. Mr. LNGnUi asked the prisoner if he hald any questions to put to the witnesses ? The prisonersaid, not at present, but he hoped they would be there again for his solicitor to cross-examine them, Mr. INxGRAx then said, he would remand the prisoner until to-morrow (this day), and he would write to the matron of the Cancer Hospital to allow Mrs. Houghton to akttenad. The pri3ouer then asked for his papers to be restored to him in order that he might instruct his solicitor, but,- ir.

THE GAN = ZLws iN SCOTLAND.--DeCiSiOng have been pronounced in an action before the Sheriff Court, at Hamnilton, Lanarkshire, at the instance of James Walker, quarrler, Darngaber, near Quarter lronworLs, against his Grace WiUiam Duke of Hamil. ton and Brandon, and James Taylor, gamekeeper, or assistant-gamekeeper to his Grace, and residing at Darngaber aforesaid. The summons concluded Ifor lOOt., in name of damages and sotatium due to the pursuer, inz consequenco of the defender Taylor, on or about the 12t]z of October, 1S56, while the pursuer was quietly walking along, or near a pasture-field, tenanted by Alexander Flein ing, farmer, Knowtop, parsh of Hamilton, having unwar* rantably and illegaly tnm led, hounded on, or let loos upon the pursuer a large ferocious mastiff dog, the pro. perty of the noble Duke, and under the charge of the de. fender Taylor at the time, or otherwise allowing said dog to seie, lacerate, and abuse the pursuer's person, by which he was seriously injured and disabled from work. ing, and his clothes torn and destroyed, by all which he bad suffered loss, injury, and damage, and for which the defenders were responsible." The defence for his Grace was that the summons was altogether irrelevant so far as directed against him, as he was not responsible for the wrong alleged to have been committed by his servant, anta that he knew notbing of the oocurrence referred to, The defence for the gamekeeper was a denial of all liability, that pursuer was illegally trespassing on his Grace's lands, and entirely to blame for the slight injury he sustained, and it app ears that he even courted IN by using violence to the defender. The Sherif=Substitute, after much hesitation, decided that Taylor, the gamekeeper, was not justified in taking off the muzzle ; but at the same time that, the pursuer being engaged in an illegal act at the time, and having failed to leave the lands when challenged, and also having by his own act approached the defender, only modified damages were due, the same being assessed at 61., against Taylor. This decision was reviewd by Judee Alison, who, for reasons assigned, amended it, alterin'hg f, interlocutor so as to "assoilzie" both the noble defender and the defender Taylor. This judgment has given much dissatisfaction In the district. tAdvertisement.)-~" Debi and Credit." Translated by Mrs Malcolm, in crown 8vo.. 6g.

MILITARY AND NA VAL INTELLIGENOE., The officers and men belonging to the 3d Battallon of the 60th Rifles, who have been for some time held in readiness to embark for India, received an order yesterday to proceed from Chatham garrison and embark at Gravesend on board the Indomitable for Madras. Orders have been received at the Provisional Battalions, Chatham, for the reinforcements for the 23d (Welsh Fusileers) 35th, 53d, 61st, Sttb, and 90th (Light Infantry) Regimnents to be held in readiness to embark at Gravesend to mnorrow on hoard the George Marshall for Calcutta. The whole of the officers and troops belonging to the Chatham division of Royal Marine Light Infantry at present at head-quarters were assembled in the barrack-square on Monday for the purpose of witnessing the presentation of a sUver medal, together with an annuity of 101., awarded by the Lords Commissioners of the Addmiralty to Sergeant William Jefferies, Royal Marines, for long service and meritorious conduct. Yesterday morning a district court-martial assembled at 'Chatham garrison, under the presidency of LioutenantColonel R. J. M'l?illop, Royal Marines, for the trial of ten prisoners belonging to the following corps for various offences :-18th Royal Irish, 19th Foot, 20th Foot, 90th Light Infantry, 98th Regiment, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery, Royal Marine Light Infantry, and the Hon. East India Company's service. The trials will probably last several days. James Lewis, Acting-Barrack-Sergeant of the Royal 'Marines at Woolwlch, was yesterday morning presented, on full parade, by Lieutenant-Colonel Hopkins with a medal (in addition to .an annuity of 101.) as a reward for meritorious conduct and long services. The 6Sth Regiment at Portsmouth are preparing to embark in the steamship Australasian about the 15th inst. for India. The ship New Great Britain arrived at Spithead on Mon,day evening from London for Hongkong, having been orn shore under Dunnose during a thick fog at 10 45 p.m. the previous day. She has apparently sustained but very little -damage. The auxiliary screw transport Indomitable, Captain Kett, sailed yesterday morning from Woolwich, having embarked 5 officers and 110 gunners of the Royal Artillery, 1 officer and 3 privates of the 44th Foot, 10 men of the 60th Rifles, and 9 of the 66th Regiment. At Gravesend she received 6 officers and 186 gunners of Captain Desborongh's company of the Royal Artillery, 1 officer and 16 men of the 12th Lancers, and 2 officers and 26 men of the 60th Rifles, making a total of 15 offlcers and 360 rank and file. She sailed direct for MIadras.
REALTEf OF LONDON. (From the Weekly Return of the Registrar-GeneraL) The returns now exhibit that increase in the mortality which usually begins in the eleventh month of the year. In the present instance the increase is considerable, the deatbs registered in London, which in the two preceding weeks were 988 and 1,047, having risen in the week that ended last Saturday (November 7th) to 1,166. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,039. But populatioa has increased, and the same rate of mortality would have produced last week 1,143 deaths. The actual number is slightly in excess of the estimated number,-a result which is not so favourable as those that have been recently obtained. The births returned in the same week exceed the deaths by 516. In comparing the deaths now returned with those of the lormer week, and distributing the ages at death in five vicenniads, It wlll appear that the increase above mentioned occurred in every period except that which extends from 40 to C0 years. Among persons 60 years old and upwards the deaths increased from 184 to 259. From diseases of the respiratory organs (exclusive of whooping-cough and phthisis) the number of persons who died at all ages in the previous week was 190; last week it was 261. Influenza showed itself, and, though only four cases are referred to it in the tables, part of the increase found under some other comnplaint is probably due to its influence. The deaths from diseases of the digestive organs rose from 55 to 79. Under 'other heads the fluctuations are unimoortant. Three children and two adults (the latter in the Small-pox Hospital) died of small-pox. Twenty-three children died of measles; and five of these died in the sub-district of Whitecross-streot. In that sub-district nine out of the 18 deaths returned were from measles, scarlittina, and fever. Diarrhcea continues to decline, and the deaths from it last week were only 27. There were two deaths from cholera; a widow, Aged 66 years, died on the 4th of November, at 117, Gravel-lane, Aldgate, of " cholera, typhoid fever (3 days);" and a man, aged 38 years, died on the 6th of November, at 2, Goulston-street, Whitechapel, of "c holera, after 14 hours? illness." It deserves to be noticed that four children died from want of breastmUk in St. George's Workhouse, Little Chelsea,throe on the l1t instant, one on the 2d. Three of these infants -were foundlings. The total number of deaths from want of tbreastmilk or inanition in London was 13. Six nonagenarians died in the week; the oldest of these was a widow, aged 96 years, who died at 7, Little Denmark-street, St. Giles; she received the Queen's Bounty, and in part supported herself, till within a year of her death, by needlework. Last week the births of 859 boys and 823 girls,-in all 1,682 children,-were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,537. At the Royal Obiervatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 748 in. The mean reading on Saturday was 30-072 in. The mean temperature of the week was 53,8 deg., which is 7'9 deg. above the average of tho same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temperature was considerably above the average throughout the week, and on Tuesday the excess was so muoh as 12-7 deg. The highest reading of the thermometer in the shade occurred on Tuesday, end was 64-3 deg.; the lowest was 43 9 deg. on the provious day. The mean daily range of the week was 101 deg. Tne greatest range occurred on Monday ard was 15 8 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 52-1 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air temperature was only 11 dug. The temperature of the water of the Thames ranged from 50-2 deg. to 547 dug. At the beginning of tho week the wind was in the south-east; on the last four days at blew generally from the north-east. Rain feln to tlbe amoutnt of 049 in., nearly all of which fell on Wednesday.
SHOCXING AcciDNT.-On Monday Mr. Hodgson, the county coroner, and a respectable jury held arn inquiry at Rimpton, Somerset, into the Circumstances attending the deaths of George Cox, aged 20; Silas Tuck, aged 46; and HIenry Pardy, aged 23, who met their deaths in a rather prcullar manner, the two latter in a generous endeavour to save the life of the former. It app-ared that Mr. Cox, the father of the first-named deceased, carricd on P- extensive business as a dairyman in this place, and had constructed otr his premises a large tank or reservoir for the purpose of the reeeption of whey, which was conveyed by a wooden shoot to the feeding troughs of the pigs, of which animals he kept a considerable number. It being necessary that this tank sbould be cleanf-d it was empted of its contents, and G. Cox, the son o. the proprietor, descended for that purpose. Whea at the bottom of the ladder he was observed to stagger and lost his footing. Tuok then hastened to his assistance aud appeared to suffer in a similar manner. Henry Pardy imumedtately went to their relief and was overcome by the same influence that had attacked his two unfortunate comrpanions. Another person on the spot gererously volunteered to descend into the tank to ascertain, if possible, the cause why the three men had not ascended or responded to the inquires that had been made of them. He proceeded zearly to the foot of the ladder, when he experienced a difficulty of breathing and hastily returned to the top, and thus his life was saved. The cause then became apparent to the bystanders, and their surmises that the three unfortunate persons had been destroyed by the fumes of carbonic acid gas proved to be correct. After the proper precautions had been taken to prevent any _urther aceident the bodies wer,, -taken out of the tank, and wedlcal assistance having in the meantime been procured upon examination life was found to be quite extinct, The above facts having been disclosed by the examination of the witnesses a verdict in accordance with the evidence was returned.

IRELAND. (FBOM OUR OWN CORRE8PONT.w 'I DUBLIN, TUESDAY MORlIG. ADVANCE IN TIE RATE OF DISCoUNT. Yesterday afternoon the wires of the telegraph brought to Dublin the startling intelligence that the directors of the Bank of England had raised the rate of discount to 10 per cent.-a rate altogether unprecedented in these countries. Of course the intelligence created the usuial temporary panic in commercial circles, and that such trade as Dublin possesses will suffer some further derangement i3 only to be expected as the result of the advance. The Freeman's JornrrwA of this morning has a sensible article upon the subject, the object of which is to calm the fears of the alarmists by showing that under all the extraordinary circumstances of the crisis no other course was open, and that the Bank of E:ngland was only coerced in self-defence and for the protection of the home trader to adopt t.he apparently severe measure of further increasing the rate of discount. The Freeman says:- "It has been so much the habit to look upon the increase of interest by the banks .s a volunitary measure of great stringency that must cripple trade and produce a mcst detrimental influence on all the routine of whose business xequires banking accommodation, that the unthinking many too often conclude that these changes are the result of caprice or worse on the part of bank directors. Those who examine all the circumstances of thepresent monetary crisis wil], however, readily conclude that the banks are actingdefensively,not offensively, and thattheincrease of the discount adopted by the Bank of England, and necessarily followed by thlerish banks, was necessitated by the heavy drain of the gold which threatened, If not checked, to reduce the stock of bullion to such an extent as would render the banks unable to meet a demand for the conversion of their notes into specie, and thus produce in theee kingdoms a crash as universal and far more ruinous than that under which the commercial cities of America are now succumbing. The high rate of discount is the only legitimate check wleh.h the banks can apply. Stringency in discounting, whichs much more injurious to legitimate trading than a high rate of interest, could not reach it. We are happy to be able to state that neither in England nor in Ireland have the banks shown the slightest tendency to adopt the stringent policy. In Dublin all our banks have adopted the most liberal policy towardstheir customers. The Bank of Ireland, the Provincial, the National, the Royal, and the Hibernian, have on each successive increase of the rate of discount followed the rule of the Bank of England; but we are able to state on the best authority that such is the confidence entertained by the heads of these establishments as to the soundness of our commercial affairs that there has not been a single instance of a bill being refused at the high rates which wsould have been discounted when the rate of interest wss2Mper cent, There bas, then, been no stringency on the part of our banks, and there will be no stringency. Legitimate traders hove hitherto received and will centiznue to receive the same liberal acco'nmodation under the rule of 10 per cent. that they received when the discounts were little more than nominal, and we can therefore look forward to the issue of the present cris with the atmost confidence. Profits may be a ade reduced, hut the legitimate bus;uess of the country was never in a better position to bear some diminution than it is at pro. sent, and by the exercise of a little prudence and foreu$ght the general mass of our traders wiU pass through the crisis unharmed. There is much to alarm in the mere enuncia. tion of '10 per cent,' but, when we come to examine it, we find in it no real cause of panic, so long as the bank directors maintain the sound, liberal policy on which they have hitherto acted, and avoid that stringency which alone traders have to dread. Interest may be so low as 5 per cent, or 2 per cent., but trade cannot flourish if the banks adopt the narrow policy. Our Irish directors appear fully to appreciate this truth, and seem resolved to act on t,he wise and broad policy of not allowing the high rate of interest to produce a particle of stringency in their dpRuBlse with theIrish traders. Perseverance in this course will carry the country safely through the crisis." PROSECUTION OF THE MAYO PRIESTS. It is quite true that the Irish Attorney-General, taking the bull by the horns, means to proceed by ex officio informations against the Rev. Messrs. Conway and Ryan. Up to 1 o'clock yesterday the bill had not been filed against the Rev. Mftr. Ryan, but the indictment against the Rev. Mr. Conway was put upon the file on Saturday, and contains no less than 32 counts. The Mail of last night says:- " There can be little doubt that the Attorney-General has sufficient grounds for thus foresta3llig the action of a grand jury; but he has, of course, exposed himself to a storm of indignation by this exerc:se of his undoubted privilege. A greater benefit could not be conferred upon this country, and especially upon the Roman Catholic laity, than the the exhibition of a practical proof that the foreign priesthood under whosi yoke they groan is amenable to the law; and this proceeding undoubtedly tends towards that end. So far the Attorney-General is faithfully redeeming the pledge he gave to Parliament, that he would do his duty towards priest and layman; and we have only to hope that he will continue in the same course stedfsst to the end." THE MEAT31 INURDER. Mr. Connell, a farmer in the county of Moath, whose barbarous beating by a party of Ribandmen was announced last week in Tlhe Times, expired of his wounds on Friday last.

UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE. OCyrFOp VnU in In a Convocation held this day at 2 o'clock, the Rev. Orby Shipley, M.A., of Jesus College, Cambridge, was admitted ad eundcm. The Rev. John Griffith, M.A., late Fellow and Tutor of Wadhanm College, was unanimously elected Deputy Keeper of the Archives. In a Congregation held Immediately afterwards the new form of statute on the subject of the Taylor Institution, which was promulgated for the first time on June 1S, hi, been amended in several points by the Hebdomadal Council, was promulgated afresh. After the form of statute had been read by the Registrar, Mr. Hansell. of Magdalen College, rose to move two amendments-one to allow the teachers to receive a fee of 11. for each pupU at the first course of lectures attended by them, all other courses being gratuitous (the statute proposes a fee of 5s. on each course); the other increasing the notice to be given by candidates for the Modern Language Scholarships from three to seven days. He also suggested that besides awarding the Scholarships, the Examiners should issue a Class List, containing the names of the other meritorious candidates. With respect to the appoint. ment of Examiners, he thought the approbation of Convoeation should be required. He was likewise dissatisfied with the arrangement about the library fund, which is to receive the balance after all other expenees are paid. He preferred the payment of a definite sum. Dr.Weilesley proposed to omit the clauses requiring subscription to the Articles on the part of the Modern Langurge Professors and Teachers, in case of their Eeing native British subjects. Mr. Hales, of Magdalen-hall, approved the suggestions of Mr. Hanell, and wished that candidates for the Scholarships should be required to have attended at least two courses of lectares in the Institution. Mr. Pattison, of Lincoln, thought the library had been hitherto starved. It had received less than 1001. a-year. The preposed plan would probably diminish this aniount. He wished, liked Mr. Hansell, to see a fixed sum assigned. The Junior Proctor defended the proposal of the statute with respect to fees. Mr. Rawlinson of Exeter, was in favour of the requirement of subsoription, and would extend it to naturalized foreigners. He put in an amend. ment to this effcot. The Master of Pembroke generally defended the statute. Dr. Pusey spoke in favour of the requisition of subscription, which was in the spirit of the old regulations. Mr. Parker, of Oriel, wished the adoption of Mr. Hanseli's amendment on the subject of fees. Mr. Pattison, of Lincoln, asked the baster of Pembroke what sum It was supposedthat the library woulareceive under the statute, and was informed probably between 2001. and 3C01. per annum. The debate was then declared closed. The Professor of Latin (Mr. Conington) will deliver a public lecture (conpistiDg of a translation of the Fourth Book of Virgil's Georgics) in the Hall of Corpus Christi College, on Monday, the 16th, at 2 o'clock. CAINBRIDGE, Nov. 10. The election of a Professor to fill the vacancy in the University Council occasioned by the resignation of Professor Sedgwick took place to-day.

NORWAY UPON THBE INDIAN MUTINIES. (From the Aorgtnblad of October 30.) We are informed that a subscription has been opened at the British Consulate-General in this city in order to afford those Englishmen who reside in Norway an opportunity of contributing towards thefund nowbeing raised for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny. | Referring to this we make bold to call upon the Britiah Consnl-General to afford the Norwegians .dso an opportunity of contributing towards the fund. We are well aware that the addition it wiU thus receive wiU be comparatively small, and also that the general scarcity of money will force many to diminish their contribaction; but we know also that there exlists in this countrygreat and universal sympathyfor those poor persons upon whom the Indian mutiny has inflicted such fearful sufferings. We are certain that the great mass hero, far from rejoicing over the misfortunes of England, and inventing all sorts of accusations against her Government of India, admit, on the contrary, rhat no European Power hps ever treated a conquered and semibarbarous race so humanely, and that England's cause in lndia is that of humanity andChristianity. Lastly,we are all penetrated with the conviction that the greatness and power which our energetio kinsmen in the British isles have won for themselves is one of the beat guarantees for the freedom and independepee of our State and of other small States. We do not therefore hesitate to declare that every blow which unfortunately might strike British power woald be considered in Norway as a misfortune only second in importance to any adversity that might befall the united kingdoms. If we give the English a proof of our sympathy no ons can deny that it is a true expression of our sentiments and chivalrous feelings, and, judging from the manner in which the English press has received similar proofs from other smaller States of their acknowledgment of the justice of Englnd's cause, we are perhaps justified in believing that a like proof of sympathy on the part of the N.Torwegians would not remain unappreciated.
TEE MUTINEEBS IN INDIA. The follov ing in an extract from a letter from Mr. George Palmer, of the Bengal Civil Service, dated from Camp Mfeeranpore iD the Mozuifernug-gur district, the 2d of September, 1857: "Since I last vrote things In India have remained very nearly in stu eoy, except that Cawnpore has been reoccupied, and I suppose by this time Lucknow relieved by Gener.al Havelock. We are all anxious to hear of that force being in a position to move on wards towards Delhi. There is now a large force, about 15,000 men, at Delhi, and we al long to hear of its fall. Lord Lake took it originally wlth much less than half that number. Everything seems to be concentrated with that view. Nearly aU the European infantry, Rifles, &c., have been taken from Meert, aud their place supplied by raw Sikh levies who have never ;fired a shot. I have been here for the lat fortnight, on the edge of the vaUey of the Ganges, opening and keeping up communication with the loyal subjects in Bijuour district. As soon as I retarned fromDelhi I had letters from them setting forth their apprehensions of the Mlahomedan Newab to whom the district was :ntrusted wben w e evacuated Bijnour, and who shortly afterwards turned traitor and proclaimed the King of Delhi, and some three weeks ago, It seems, his tyranny having surpassed all bounds, the chief Hindoo gentlemen and 'Salookars,' acting together, fought and defeated a force of the Newab's which he had sent to extortalacof rupees from one of their number, and ultimately deposed the Newab ; they then wrote temptingus toreturn and rule the country, orat aIl events to be assured of their loyalty, and asking for instructions. I then, and since (in the absence of my chief, who was in the Hillg), made an earnest request for a small force to reoccupy the district, which was backed moet warmly by our excellent Commissioner. I only asked for 300 Ghoorka or Sikh infantry, some 100 or 150 cavalry, and two 6-pounder guns and a howitzer; with this I would have engaged to hold the districtagainst any invasion of undisciplined Mussulmaus from the rest of Rohilcund, and, with the aid of our loyal subjects, to restore peace aud order within the district ; it would have been amply sufficient-but the military authorities could not give me a man. I have been here for upwards of a fortnight in daily communication with our loyal friends on the other side of the river Ganges, and once effected an interviewvr ith them, hearing daily the ups and downs of the struggle, which has now assumed a religious colouring-i. e. Mahomedana versus Hindoos-of the Hindoos being gradually broken up, wearied out, separated, and at last that while one was absent on a mission two others bad run away, leaing Bijnour at the mercy of the Newab's people, and the three noblest and most loyal of our Salookdars, two brothers and their nephews, had beeu defeated, and were beleaguered in their castle, all this without my being able to move hand or foot to help them. I am glad to say that to-day has brought me a well-authenticated report that the brothers to whom I allude had received reinforcements and been able not only to hold their own, but to repulse the Newab's men with considerable loss; they had made preparations, ho vever, to blow up themselves aud their families in the event of the day having gone against them. Poor fellows, I have kept their hearts up with assurances and promises of aid, little thinking it would be so long in coming. It is now impossible that a force can be sent within 10 days at least. As soon as a small force does move into the district with us order will be at once restored by its moral effect. Since I have been here I have not been idle; in six days I collected and sent into the chief station 30,000 rupees, with a very small exception nearly clearing all the balances due to Government on account of the last half-year's revenue in this section of the district. On one or two occsiions I had to make a demonstration of force (and once had to punish), surrounding villages before dawn writh cavalry, driving their focks all into one spot, placing sentinels over them, and then putting the village under an interdict until the money was forthcoming; but generally the appearanoo of two troopars carrying with them a bit of paper has been sufficient. I t is a good instance of the effect of prestige with these people. Here, aU along the river hank, all round where I am now writing for miUes, for weeks and weeks the country was at the mercy of the Goojours rni other scoundrels, who collected in mobs of some hundreds, all well armed, stopped the roads, plundered and burnt every village that was not in concert with them, and which did not pay down very large sums as black mail. "I came down here with 25 troopers of an Irregular Cavalry Regiment, including the native cavalry officers. The country at this season is generaUy quite impracticable for cavalry, and, as you very well know, if 100 or so of determined men, though untrained, were to make a stand in a village with mud walls, 25 of the best troopers in the world could not turn them out; yet, as soon as f came here not merely did all crime cease and the roads become open and safe, butt aU the ringleaders bolted, and are stiU in biding; but I am glad to find an English officer and handful of troopers such a tugbear. "I have also taken the opportunity of getting a number of boats across from the opposite bank of the river Ganges, establishing a gaard over them and the nucleus of Commis. sariat arrangements on this bank, so that when a force can be spared it will have no delay or difficulty as to the passage of the river. Previously all the boats were on the other side, and consequentlyin the hands of whoever was master there-so I think my larrangement is an advantage with a view to possible contingencies. I am sorry to say that I learn from numbers of servants, public and private, and others who have come across to see me, that all my property at Bijnour has been confiscated by the Newab. I carried with me when I left Bijnour only what could be hastily put into a smaaU cart, without overloading it, and so the bulk of all I had was left, including, I am sorry to say, my plate, which was in the Government Treasury. You wil be glad to hear that I, of course, mada a point of bringing off my arms, bt stilU my loss has been heavy, especially the books and the papers which cannot be replaced. I hear the Newab opened your black nortmanteau, containing my full-dress uniform, &c., with niuch interest, and forthwith sent it (the uniform) to his own house; so, perhaps, when he pays the debts of his treason I nay find it again. " I am living nodr in the house of the chief merchant of this town. It is lonely enough to have no English face to look at, or to talk to, especially in these times; but stitl I am very thankful that I am as wel in health as I am, not- Iwthstanding hard work, exposure, and sun. I am very fortunate, too, in having my old Punjab servant and his brother with me. Though at a distance from their own homes, and though Mussulmans, and though subjected to every kind of temptation, they have served me most faithfully, rand I trust them as if they were my own kith and Idn. If anything shorld happen to me In these days, pray do not forget to do somethingtfor them. The eldest's (my zemindar) name is Syced Ameer Ali, son of Sheik Rookeen-ood-deene of Ealinore, in the distf- ct of Gordaspore, in the Ptniib"; [N.B. This man, when he heard of Mr. Palmer's return to India in the early part of last year, travelled 600 mies on foot from the Pnnjab to reach Mr. Palmer, in the hope of being taken again into his service, arriving at the station only a few weeks before the mutiny broke out, and was obliged to sell the silver hilt of his sword to pay his expenses during the latter part of his journey.]
CHARLES MATHEWS'S ADVICE TO THE AMERICANS. -Charles Mathews made a speech in Boston, three weeks ago, In which he said :-" I am somewhat unlucky in timing my visits to America. In 1838, some nineteen years ago, : first crossed the Atlantic, and popped upon a pecuniary crisis in New York; and now, in 1857, I have had the lnucs to pop upon another. It seems as if my presence were doomed to bring a panic with it (great laughter), but I am happy to find at any rate thAt it has nothad the effect of frightening you out of the theatre. (Laughter and ap. plause.) Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, I think the best you can do is to come into it as often as possible, and to divert your mind for an hour or two from the cas of real life. In times of difficulty, so far from its being an expensive luxury, the theatre is about the cheapest mode you can adopt of passingyourleisuremoments. (Laughter.) Duringone of our hardest winters in London a poor man was observed almosb every night, to tho surprise of the money taker, aying his 3d. to the gallery of the Surrey Theatre. At last, out of ouriosity, he got into conversation with him. 'How is it,' said he, 'that you, who appear to be a very poor man, can afford to come and pay your money here night after night, when one would think you had barely enough to keep life .ad soul together at home?' 'That's it,' said he, I X come here out of economy. (Laughter.) It's the cheapest way I can spend my evening. At home I must burn fire and candle, and have something to eat and drink for myself and friend, and at an expense of 2s. or 3s. at the least; while hare I geb warmed, lighted, lodged, and amused, with plenty of good company around me, and all for 3d.' There was philosophy in this, ladies and gentlemen, and I recom. mend it to your serious cousideration," (Mucluh iughter.) d
INDIA AND CHR.STIANITY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have no wish to plunge into the controversy which I foresaw to be inevitable when I read of the proposal to erect a Christian place of worship over the " Well at Cawnpore." I am, on my own part, disposed to view with satisfaction tbe " zeal" of which the idea was begotten; that it should itself beget effort more zealuus than discreet is no matter of surprise to me, for I am of those who hold that two-tbirds of the real good which is ever done in this world originates iu the breasts and is started by the words and deeds of "good men lacking discretion." I think it early days to fight about the nature of the "Memorial" to the slain at any one scene of massacre in India; God only knows how many more appeals to such sympathy may yet arise; but I do not think any day too early for the consideration how Christianity can best attack idolatry. I can conceive the case of a statesman caled on to regard this great question having made up his mind not only that the thing is right in itself, but that the country imperatively demands that it should at once be seriously entertained. Of course, he is well read in the press; he has furnished his own mind with all the varied arguments brought to his notice in "leading articles," "correspondence," " speeches," at all manner of " gatherings." He has waded through a certain number of the best "pamphlets," has had many interviews with the secretaries. of societies," as many consultations with em and existent great Indian authorities. At what conclusion does he arrive ? Of aU the " panaceas," the propositions which have been made to him, is there one for the conversion of the Hindoo or Musulman which he doe, not see at work at home on the natives of Christian England; and is the result here in any vay equal to what is promised him from the same means in India? The wearied man turns from others to himself, from what B, C, D, &c., propose, to what he, A, is to do. In England he beholds all manner of Christian men, in all manner of ways, contending with vice, ignorance, infidelity; he sees them elbowing each other. "shinning" each other, not caring even to overturn each other, so that each in his own way, after his own fashion and creed, can do some good; he sees a great deal of good is done even amid the "din" of the ill-will that exists between different sections of those who do it. Vice is being worried more or less here, there, and everywhere. Men don't hunt rats with staghounds or pitch deernets to catch blackbeetles. We suit our instruments of destruction to the nature of that which is to be destroyed, and are fortunate in those inventive powers which afford us cannon at Woolwich, mousetraps at the village shop. Just so does our " statesman" see anti-vice engines of many varieties. He sees work for them all, and, as they all work their hardest, alas! he sees need for more work, if not for fresh manner of work. No inventions for the destruction of opposing armies have ever yet preserved us from liability to war, any more than has any invention ever yet rid us of rats or the turnip-fly. While man lives he will find his enemies in his own kind; no power he can attain, no exercise of his wondrous powers of invention, can prevail altogether against the macbinations and inventions of those who, if he knows anything of himself, as himself are by nature disposed to eviL What vermin are to our barns and fields the evil passions of men are to the scene of our own life. Where nuts grow weevil are found; where man is vice wfil be. We may extirpale a good deal of it by warring on the scenes which toster it-by opposing to its influences an influence powerful against it; stiUl all our cleansings and purifyings, all our teachings and preachings, will leave the enemy yet in force; not powerfulto banish Christ and His army from the field, or even to cause a halt for one moment in that army's nrarch; still all powerful to harass the promoters of His faith, to sow tares where they have sown wheat, to foul the ground they have purified, and by many a device turn hack to evil hearts they had educated to good. The statesman who looks on Enaland with the most ordinary knowledge of what England really is, *with all her privileges, all her profecsion, may well sigh over the task set him, of finding here, ready to his hand, the machinery for the conversion of India. He looks at his own rank of life; perhaps for a moment dwells on certain well-known habits of his own; he scans the face of general society, and aees how many a god is worshipped besides-nay, in preference to the one God; he is forced to the a- mission that the great battle of English general life is not that for eternal life. Mammon, power, pleasure, are not these our gods? At least, to what god ever gave we such open, avowed worship? We are a nation greedy for the " grand " in everything; we must have monster vices, and yet delightin monstrous efforts to denounce them. We sin cheerfully in the supporting companionship of crowds who do the same, and then we rush in crowds of many thousands to enjoy some extraordinary denunciation of the very sins to which we return with unabated relish. Petty extraYagance has become contemptible; roguery of small measure is held to be indeed vile. Lavish waste on the things we wear and on the furnishing our tables; the bold knavery which keeps its well-appointed brougham and aims at "tens of thousands" in its course of polished villany; that calculating enterprise which lounds a school to mask the robbing a bank-these are characteristics of a day in which there is a cry the statesman must heed-Christianity for India. Because we abuse our blessings at home, because the contest between good and evil does each day prove thatwith all our efforts at good yet sin walks abroad in a greatness which is still most defiant, shall we despair for virtue ? Because in many a handto-hand fight at home Christian teachers of every kind get often thrown shall we leave the Devil to his own way in India, holding it to be policy to make gain of his votaries, as they are there, rather than risk gain by disturbing his power over them ? What farmer is fool enough to throw away his traps, destroy his ferrets, and burn his " arsenical confection," because there are yet each year more rats and mice than he can with all his patience bear to see? Does not every wise farmer rather try by the shrieks from his traps, the warnings of his poisons, the ever-to-be-dreaded presence of his intruding ferrets, to be well understood as one who still hates, will still war on vermin? There is a vast difference in the two fields for Christian exertion as seen at home and in India. We seem inclined to forget that a great part of what is vice here, known as such without dispute, i2 in India a part of religion. That which the preacher and schoolmaster have to denounce here as opposed to the nation's faith there is the direct result of the national creed. It is no slight thing to shame a man out of habits which are directly connected with his form of worship. If we find in a land of churches and chapels unbelief abounds and the most open indulgence in wickedness prevails what a task do we thndertake when w'e set about a crusade against an infidelity which is yet creed, and a vicious indulgence which is yet creed-hallowed ! The attempt to Christianize India is one in wholesome sympathy with the spirit of our age; it is a "monster" idea; we are fighting for the very tenure of that enormous territory; no living man can say at what cost we shall again hold it as our own. At the very moment when justice demands an awful account of those who have fouled history with their deeds, while the statesman is at his wit's end how to recover, to again resume our empire in India, the long-insulted Christian spirit of the land has burst all control, aud claims that we should now plant the Cross as wel as re-establish the authority of the Crown. No matter the cost or difficulty of the work. Can commerce command a Stephenson or a Brunel, and find the funds and means for the boldest creations of their Titanic inteUects, and shall the British people own a land in which a heathenism, degrading in its nature, bestial in its rites, pre- Tails, and yet find themselves helpless to cause the truth to prevail? It is said we want " ebers," "Henry Martyns" -yes, legions of them ; but is not the fact that their names are now so invoked proof how rare such men are? Were all the men who worked on the Sydenham Palace or the Great Eastern men of great note in their respective calliugs? Were not these wonders of our age the result of master-minds directing to oae end a vast subdivision of labour ? The best mechanic and the mere labourer had each his station; the one could not have done the work of the other; the work of one might have been of greater money value than that of the other, but the design of the engineer was dependent on the proper application of the respective qualifications of both. The work, once conceived, has yet to be reduced to detail; there is as much of real science in bringing thl conception of genius into the condition neces- siery to distribute the task for each force by which it is to be attained as there is in the first entertaining of the great idea itself. The Christian mind of England declares the religion of Christ shall be developed in all its entirety in India, no matter the millions whose prejudices it may shock; no heed is to be given to the storms which will surely beat about that " Great Eastern" mi sion. It is the nation's will that India shaU be governed henceforth, not as compelling the Heathen to believe, but in strict acordance with the principles of Christ's religion; that religion is to be allowed its own free course, exposed to no official interruption; its teachers are to be recognized and encouraged, not merely suffered while they are suspected. The nation is prepared to see a Government of India which wrU secure to the native freedom from all attempts to coerce his conjscience, but it will never again endure anything like direct or indirect patronage of those religious rites which are abhorrent to our every sense. No countenance must be given to that which we pronounce to be a false and foul worship; every support must be freely afforded to those who, in proper subjection to our own laws, promulgate the truths and offer the ordinances of our own creed. The skiled engineer has his mind ever on the watch to note every extension and improvemecit in those mechanical forces on which he is altogether dependent. In the work of govering millions by Christian rule who are yet in every way anatiChristian, the statesman is bound to be ever alive to every improvement or addition to the existing means of rooting out the false to plant the true. Missionary craft is not handicraft, and yet just as the latter has its many schools, each skiUed in its own tools, so is Christ's message worked out on the world's surface to glorious ends by messengers and means in great variance in many things. There is di&rence in the instruments, difference in method, but there is this much of agreement-all aim at the propagation of what each holds to be truth; aU at least agree in what they are determined to assault as fatal error. There may possibly be strong shades of difference in the opinionsi held by the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the GospeL The Nonconformist societies may have a stronger antagonistic bias against the one or the other-a bias against both ; but in the day of a strong combat with infidelity, in the thick of the fight, I should have no fear but that each would find room to work, and, worling against the common enemy, would, for the moment at least, cease to question the detail of their own mutual " associations." Were India planted with cathedrals, ckurches, chapels, mission stations, mission schools, to the full desire and to the extent of a quadruple means of every existing " society" or "association," the aggregate effort of aU would for years yet to come do little more than hold Christ's ground; its positive extension must be the work of many years. It is not only hereditary, deep-seated creeds and prejudices 'which are to be encountered, but the effect of a long series of years, in which a Christian Government has afforded a very lukewarm exposition of Christianity; you may saw a wooden god in two pieces to prove it only a carved log, but there are ways of worshipping the true God as though that worship had. scarce a wiser hold on the heart. It is one thing to queU a rebellion, it is another and a very different thing to seize the moment of a new forcible subjection to hold up with all reverence matters which before the rebelliou you were content to see treated as of no great importance. We are bound to regard the difficulties which will not only beset those who go to teach, but those who are to be taught,-those who rule over both. In the matter of the propagation of our faith in India we must " possess our soul's in patience." The sword once more in its sheath, we may hope to see fresh, perhaps more favourable opportunity to promulgate the great doctrines of peace. Fairplaywill, I trust, be cheerfully given to every rational attempt at the conversion of the natives. Above all, let us fondly hope that the minds of them who rule may be by God directed to see their great portion of the work -them_elves, in life, in word, and deed, proving to the native the exceUenee, the humamty, the purity of their faith. The open concubinage of those in authority is a wretched commentary upon the doctrines they profess; tyranny and exaction have nothing in common with Christianity; can we wonder that much native conversion has only been lip deep when those who from high places have raled as Christians have yet lived in open contempt of the rule of their creed. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Nonconformists may be rivals for the honour of raising a Christian temple over the scene of Satan's late temporary triumph; the latter claim a Havelock, but yet gracefully uphold the memory of a Heberare prompt to respect the work of a Wilson. I augur wel from a zeal which is thus courteous and candid to an opponent; there is room and to spare for aU who would build, preach, andcteah. May the onset on the great enemy of manbe made in a spirit man's Great Friend would approve. S. G. 0.
TIrE RoYAu SocIr.-The Council of the Royal Society have recently been deliberating whether an emnployment might not be found for their annual surplus of income over expenditure more beneficial to science and to the society itself, and with this view the treasurer has drawn up a general statement of their finances during the last nine s ears, that period having elapsed since the present statutes came into operation regarding the admission of Fellows. From that document it appears that the aggregate receipts of the society In the nine years, irrespective of funds held in trast for speiric objects, havebeen25,5961 2s. id, ora yearly average of 2,8441. Os. 3d.; and the total disbursements have been 21.3741. 6s. 9d., or an annual rverage of 2,3741. l8s. 6d.; showing an excess of receipts over expenses in the nine years amounting to 4,221. 15s. 8d., or a yearly average excess of receipts of 4691. Is. 9d. The probable receipts for the ensuing year, irrespectSve of trust funds, are estimated at 2,9641., and the expenses at 2,4221., making an excess of receipts over expenses of 5421. The number of Fellows on the home list on November 30, 1847, was 764, and on November 30, 1856, 661. There had therefore been a decrease in the nine years of 103 being an average of between 11 and 12 a-year. The number of Fellows who had compounded for annual subscriptions was on November 30, 1847, 480, and on November 30, 1856, 376; 164 having died, and 60 having been added. The number of Fellows paying annual subscriptions was on November 30, 1847, 284, and on November 30, 1856, 285. The number whose su acriptions had ceased from death or other causes in the nine years was 99, and the number of new subscribers in the same interval 100; showing that the decrease which has taken place In the number of Fellows has been entirely In the compounders. The income under the head of dividend is derived from the accumulated excess of income over expenditure during many years, amountinz at present to a total, exclusive of funds held in trust for specific objects, of 29,5181. stock, bearing 3 per cent. interest, subject to deduction for income-tax. The treasurer thinks it may possibly be required to sell about 5001. of this stock to increase the balance in hand available for the payment of the removal charges to Burlington-house; but, allowing for that, they reckon the probable annual excess of income over expenditure at about 5001. The report goes on to say it may deserve the consideration of the president and eouncil whether more advantageous employment might not be found for this annual surplus than that of continuing to increase the accaumulated funds, which are already more than sufficient, it addition to the other soutroes of income, to defray the oustomary expenSes of the year. The consideration, it adds, here suggested seems to be particularly suitable at the present tine, when the final decison of the law courts has vested in the Royal Society, subject to the part Payment of oertain annuities, a fourth share of pro rty in British and foreign funds whioh in 1852 was vaXed at more than 100,0001. In addition to this the socSety will eventually oome into possession of MEr. Handley's legacy, bequeathed in 1844 for special purposes named in the bequest, and understood to be in value about 6,0004, Three per Cent. Stock. DEATx OF MR- ARCaIALD A HAsTnE, .P.-We regret to have to announce the death of Mr. Archibald astie, M.P. for Paisley, which took place at Edinbugh ona Monday last. Mr. Hastie had been much indspoe for some months; but It was hoped, until recently, that the strength of his constitution would enable him to recover. He was in his 65th year. Mr. Hastie was in many respects a remarkable man. He was descended of respectable parents :n the West of Scotland. He had merely the comwon school education of his country; but that and his natSve sense fitted him to fill with crodit various important situations. At an early period his brothers settled in Calcutta, where they carried on business partly as coachbuildors and partly as merchants, while he settled In London, acting partly as their agent and partly speculating on his owa account. The whole family were very succossful. At a later period Mr. Hastie became connected with the East India Docks, and his sagacity and ability were eminently displayed in the skill and suocess with which he assisted In rescuing that important concern from the depression into which its affairs had sunk after the cessation of its monopoly A.purchase which he effected of some proferty in oapokl shire has aso turned out to be extremely advantageous. In 1836 Mr. Hastie was elected Member of Parliament for Paisley-a distinction on which he set a high value. And It may be said thet it cost him a high price, for, owing to the severe distress with which his constituents were freonently vsited, very heavy demands were made upon him,which he met with the greatest generosity and goodwill. In oolitics Mr. Hastie was an independent consistent Liberd, and voted uniformly with that party in Parliament. In private life he vwas in the highest degree generous, open-hearted, and friendly. His hospitalities were conducted on a large sud a liberal scale. He was the owner of Burns' Iunehbowl, and the oelebrations of the poet's birthdav hed at his house were by fir the best of such festivals,
ST. JAMES'S THEATRE. The performances of Italian comic opera, which have been for some timo announced, were commenoed last tights. The house was attended by a fashionuble andlence, and the: opera selected for the occasion- neorno di CoflmeZ& _ waa recelved with great favour throughout. The singerato whom the principal characters were intrusted onlr form a portion (aad generaijy Bpeaking, we bei}eve, not thec most distinguished portion) of the actal company engae The remarkable incident of the evening wag the first intro. duction to thi3 country of a veritable Neapolit,, " buffo," in the person of Signor Carrione, who undertook. the part of Columelta, and assumed the traditional costume. of "Pulcinells," which, but for the half-mack and felt. ' fooPscap," would be almost identical with that of theancientFrench "Pierrot." Whether the humour of tbhi representative of a national type is calculated for the easttl. appreciation of an English audience we have no indinatlom. at present to inquire; but as he delivers most o2 hl&. recitative with the pure Neapolitan accent, which to ready, Italian scholars offers unoommon difficulties, aud ccom-.- penies it by a superabundance of gesticulation that even. in our own pantomimic clown (affirmed by many authoritis. to be a corruption of the original " Pulcinell") wouU.1 appear exaggerated, the succes achieved by Signor Carrlone lst night must be set down either to the extreme good., humour of the andience, or to their Implicit faith Ka. the genuine nature of the peraonage thus for the first time presented to their notioe. Certain it is, whatever Signor Carrione did elicited the heartiest laughtera. and this notwithstanding the fact that everything he did, was wholly unlike what we ha ve hitherto been accustomen. to regard as "funny." Possibly true nationality in art. carries a weight with it which is irresistible, though it may, be addressed to a tribunal that Is not at all nationaL Signor Carrione, nevertheless, is no' the hero of the opero which bears the name of the grotesque individual he imper_ sonates. The story of II Ritorno di CoumtU may beo traced in a very few lines. Aurelio and Elisa are mutually in love, and betrothed to each other. Important buaines. forces Aurelio to make a journey to Padu. In his absence,. Alberto, his brother, who also loves ElAia, forges a letter. which is placed in the hands of the Wdy,mnd informs her thatsome irrevocable destiny has compdled Aurelio, the supposed writer, to become the husband of another. In despair Elisa listens to the suit of Alberto,-and, just as the nuptials are about to be celebrated, Aureio unexpectedlyreturns. The bereaved lover, driven to distraction, losa.. his senses, and is forthwith conveyed to a madhouse. Alberto, however, beholding the misery of which he ha. been the instrument, confesses the whole to Bliss, asking her forgiveness. She will only pardon him on condition of having. Aurelio restored to her, and this, through agencies at coim mand of most dramatists (and of which the Italian librettiat seems to possess the secret as welU as the rest of the confraternity) is ultimately brought about. Columella (" Palcinella," as his master familiarly calls him) is the confidential domestic of Aurello, and is played a simlla&* trick with regard to Serpina, Elisas waiting maid, to whom he is attached, his treacherous rival being Steffanello, the. favourite servant of Alberto. As Is the case with the majority of Neapolitan operas belonging to this special class-. -the " buffo" element is predominaut, and gives the colour to the whole. The music (or rather a large part of it) is by a son of the once renowned but now forgotten Floravanti, whose Canter, trice 4inc and Virtuosi A mbuundi sustained the fortunes of the Italian opera in Paris about half a century sin-a, and who wrote about 30 operas besides-to says othing of motets snd masses for the church, very much in the style of his dramatic works. Fioravanti belonged to the school of Cimarosa, of who n (though inferior in every respect) he was one of the most successful imitatorsm He chiefly exoelL1it in comic opera, and there was a certain eas flow about his6 music that atoned for the absence of originality and ac. courted for its popularity. Italy has gliven birth to manysuch composers-men who eajoyed universal favour in their day, but nore of whose produotions contained the elements. of darability. How truly Fioravanti belonged to this cate. gory may be gathered from the fact that he only begu to write operas a year or two before the death of Mrozart, What remains of him is now only known to bibllographs, whose pleasure it is to take note even of the most insignificant phenomena which, through their t3mporary inf'dence, may have assisted or retarded the progcs, of art. By the indifferent world the elder Fioravanti in. often confounded with his son, Vincenzo, whose music, though betraying less fiuency, less knowledge, and less of the true comic spirit, is written very much after the same ep'nemeral pattern. To criticise sach a work as. the RBtom-no di Oolumella would be to bestbw serious attention on that which lays no claim to it. It pre. sents no distinguishing points to lay hold of, and has few, if any, pretensions to be considered as a work of art. True, the hearer is constantly reminded by snatches of tune and recitative of materials that have been handled in s much more artistic maraer by other composers, but these would. seem to be traditionary phrases which musicians of the Neapolitan school have regarded as common propertyand made use of whenever they came conveniently to hand. As a spec'men of the esrentially popular "opera buffa," however, it is entitled to aceptance, and will,please from its entire absence of effort, and the heartygood wiliMwith which it accomplishes its very unambitious purpose. At any rate it is greatly superior to the kind of music put forward at the Bouffes Pariricns, which for the rnost part does not rise above the level of ordinary "vaudcs-We." Moreover, it is really ntion4l, and thus for the first time affords the English public a notion oE the kind of entertainment that delights, not the Near)olitan "amateurs," but the Neapolitan peoplc. A better example might have been selected, no doubt, evern for the purpose in hand. What CoZumd&la may have been. In its original state, when produoed at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples, some 20 years since-under the united names of " rassaro and Vincenzo Fioravanti"-it is hard to guess; but at present Signor Fioravanti's share of the muasic is reduced by something like 50 per aent. ; and the. interpolation of a great many pieces of Mercadante, Baunozzala, and other composers-even down to Signor Randegger, the clever director of the orchestra on the present occasion of its revival-gives it altogether the air of a " pasticcio," in which the work of the originator, although decidedly superior to the rest both in geniality and dramatic truth, occasionally and inevitably has a sort of " bagwigglsh" air which il consorts with the smore modera effusions into an alliance with which It is dragged. The performance, on the whole, was very spirited, .1though the performers are not all unexceptionable. The first lady, Mademoiselle Furnagall4 who impersonates :liss, has feeling and dram4tic instinct; but her voice is sadly worn, and her intonation not invariably exat The tenor, Signor Dordoni (Alberto), would, we think, be regarded as incompetent even in an Italian theatre-which is sayiag a great deal now-a-days. Signor Carrione has been. described; but, as a comic singer, Signor Casteti (Stefanello) is entitled to higher praise than what may attach to mere vocal buffoonery. A trio in the third act-in which this gentleman took part with Signor Carrione, and Signor Gall (who played the part of Dr. Bisticcio, superintendent of the madhouse, remarkablywell)-was the greatest "hit" of the entire opera. Nothing could possibly be sung and acted with greater spirit. A boisterous " encore" was the result. From the rest of the drametis personcs we must single out Signor Colombo, a barytone, who sang the music and represented the character of the deceived lover, Aurelio, with the utmost sentiment and foeling. After the opera the " National Anthem" was given, in a style which (to adopt polite language) may be termed "decidedly original." M!eantime Mademoiselle Tangioni, a " soprano;" Signor Giorgetti, a tenor; Signor Ferrario, a barytoneo; and Signor Ciampi, a legitimate " buffo," are to appear, and, if we may credit report, on their exertions wil chiefly depend the succese of the present undertaking. We may add that the orchestra and chorus are numerous and efficient, and that the theatre-one of the most elegant, if one of the smallest in Europe-has been " renovated" in such a manner as to endow it with an aspect unusuaUy pleasant and. cheerful.
LORD CLAREDDox Ai.D DR. LTrvcG-TO,X.-A. few days ago Lord Goderich, M.P., and General Thompson, A.P., had an interview with the Earl of Clarendon at the l oreign.office, at which they presented to his Lordship the memorial agreed to recently by the Leeds and Br qor Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Scoretary for Foreign Affairs to use his infuence with the Portugnese Govermnent to secure the freo navigation of the ZAmbese river, and toafford that freedom of transit and of commercial intercourse in the Portrpucse colonies, on both the West and East COasts of Africa, vnich the memoriaUstthinknecesary in order to, develope the resources of these colonles as well as of the native districts. Lord Clarendon listened most attentively to the statements made to him, and gave the deputation satisfactory assurances as to the intentions of the Government. Dr. Livingstone, be said, would prooeed to Lisbon. with the stronges. recommendations, both to the King and. Government of Portugal, and would reeive the hearty sup. port of our Minister at that Court in his efforts to seenre reedom of navigation of the Zambese, and the utmost facilities for commercIal intercoumse with the interior of Africa. Lord Clarendon entered fully into the views of thedeputation as laid down In the memorial, and seemed to beF particularly impressed with the necessity of encouraging the growth of cotton by all practicable means. The deputation also brought under his Lordship's notice the snbject, of the recent renewal of the internal save trade on the West coast of Africa in consequenoe of the proceedngs of the French, and Lord Clarendon told them that the attention of the Government was strongly directed to the matters. and that they were in communication with the FrencL Government in respect to it. He also begged the deputation. to assure the Leeds and Bradford Chambers of Commeroe, that he was at all times glad to receive from such bodiwea information aa to their views upon subjects oonnected with the commercial interests of the country. Another deputation, from the British Association, oonsisting of thePresident, the Rer. Dr. Lloyd, the Rev. Dr. Robinson of Armagh, Sir Roderick Murchison, Mr. M'Gregor L4ird, and Colonel Sabine, accompanied by Dr. Uivingstone, haveF lso had an Interview with Lord Clarendon to represent toW himn the importance of the Government aending a vessel to survey the entrance to the Zambese, and to asoend the& rlver as far as practicable for navigation. Many similarrepresentations, It is said, have been made to the Governmnent, and though the answer to the last-named' deputation. has not transpired, the probability is that an objeot recoinmended by the interests of sience and of commerce, aswelt as on higher grounds, will eventually be accomplished.
