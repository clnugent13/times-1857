THE INDIAL Mr MTINIES. THE MUTINY AT BENARES. We publish the following ,election frm the private letters from India with which we have been faIwmwA .A BENARES, Jvuz 13, The last two mails must have conveyed to you the Intel, ligenos of the mautiny and bhtchery at Meernt and Delih Since then, from Pesbawur to Benares there is not one sttion in which the native troops have not broken out, and the 'whole country Is in one stte of confuslon. The zemin. dar, too, have taken advantage of the times and have risen, and are plundering and looting in all directions. ARl posta communication has been cut off, and the telegraph haa ceased to work. We have had no communication with Agra for the past fortnight, and no intelligenoe can now be had with Alahabad even. With the rest our time has come. We haTe been expecting the outbreak here for the ps three weeks. It came oa the 4th. We got an express from A2imghur to say that the 17th Native Iantry had mautinled and plundered the Treasury, killing every 1uropean; but this was subsequently modified. On hearing this Iknewourtimewasup, but as I hoped to have l2hours' start before the information got out I went and engaged two garrees, one for Harriet and the other for Mrsm Captain Dodgson, to send them off at once. While these garrees were cominR I went off to the judge to explain why I sent Harriet away, to guard against future remarks, and to offer myself for any servioe that might be needed for work so near at hand. I then went to the commissioner, to offer a seat in the garree to any female member of his family. It was accepted for a sister-in-law. After despatehing the ladies I was to go and reside with Tueker and his family. I had hardly returned home 10 minutes, when bang, bang went the cannon-knew all was up. Saw crowds running for the life. Had my buggy at the door; bundled Harriet and our little boy, two guns, a revolver, and a pistol and s word into it, and drove to Mr. Tucker's the oommissioner's. He had never fired ashotinhis life, and had not a weapon of any kind in the house, which I knew; 'but as his house was a 2Juia* one, and capable of defence, I drove there instead of to the Mint, which was the rendezvous. In the house there were Mr. Tacker. Misn Tucker, four little children, and a sister-in-law of Mr Tucker, with my guns only. Got them to the terrace of the house and covered them up with straw, and made every prepmation we could. In came Captain Watson with two ladies, but without any weapon. All this time the cannon were bhng. ing away and a rattle of musketry going on, and the 'Whole of the Sepoy lines were on fire. The rasally Sepoys were flying in squads past the house, with terror depleted in their faces, and very many of them had thrown away their muskets, accoutrements, &o., and were cutting like fun. Seeing this, and fearing that they might make an attempt atthe house after thefiringhad ceased, I determined to go off to the bridge near my house and try and make a staad there, so as to stop the Sepoys fiying any more to our side. Got upon Mr. Tucker's horse and galloped off, followed by Mr. Tucker, having left Captain Watson in charge of the ladies with my battery of guns. Immediately we came to the bridge the Sepoys, instead of coming our way, made a rush down the sides of the bridge leading to the banks of the Burns. There were at the time 50 sowars of the 13th Irregulars stationed opposite my gate. We begged of 25 of them to follow to cut off these vagabonds, but not a man would stir on the plea that it was, the collector's hookum (order) not to budge from the Treasury, which was held by 100 Sikhs. The array, however, helped us to frighten the Sepoys. The runawals decreasing in number, I swept over the bridge to find out how things were going on at the Mint, where Mrs. Dodgson was, and who had been placed under my care. Mr. Tuoker led this time. " Ping" went a bullet at him, but missed. I had three shots with my revolver on the bridge, but just as I came to the narrow part, jtul tbree or four yards before me, I saw one of these rascally runaways ramming home a cartridge. Bang went the musketatme;but'twmasabadshot, for instead of hitting me he slightly wounded the horse. Away we flew, but midway we came upon 50 sowars of the Irregulars. One fellow came with a pistol cocked st me, and said that they had no officerand no commands, sand what were they to do? I asked them (20) to follow me, but the fellows hesitated, and M1r. Tuccer advised me not to trust myself to them. We left them and went to the Mint, and met 50 European soldiers, and. sent them off to protect the other ladies. We had hardly been gone 15 minutes when these 50 sowars bolted, after firing a volley into the Europeans we had just left. Galiopped back as fast as we could to our dear ones. The firing had by this time ceased, and thinking the worst was over I put off mny sword, &c., and ordered diner. Hardly a dish had reached the table when bang, bang went the guns agNin-this time at the Sikbs, who had joined the37th. Thesamescene of flying Sepoys; for you must know we had two 4-pounders pounding the rascals with grape, which they could not stand. Shortly after in came Colonel Gordon with 30 European soldiers, and carried us off to the Mint. It was a fearful time, and enough to sober one for life; such a scene met us at the Mint, which was choked with refugees. Every one had some one to inquire for, but no one could say where any one was. It was a long aud anxious night. With dawn more courage was plucked up, The panic among the mutineers, however, had been so great that not a man could be heard of, and even the thieves and budmashes had mizzled; for, notwithstanding every bungalow had been left to take care of itself, not a pin had been stolen, or even a thatch burnt. Every refugee was busy removing valuables, and all got something. Our treasury was safe. The treasure was removed by 12 o'clock at noon to the ArtilleryBarracks, but not a man budged out for the next 24 hours; yet the fear and funk had been so wholesome that all our property remained untouched. On Saturday, seeing all quiet, we determined to spend the day at home, but all of us returned to the Mint at night. How long these things are to last God knows. I see no chance of any amendment, but must hold on till more European soldies come in, and the weather less hot-100 deg. indoors. We had long known that the 37th were mutinous, but were waiting for more soldiers to disarm them. The mutiny at Azimghur, however, precipitated matters. On the news reaching us a parade was ordered for the evening. The hour "ame; the feDlows smelt a rat. Instead of obeying o-ders, they began popping at the soldiers (viz., the 37th Native Infantry did). The Bri6ishers went at them. The blackies retreated into their lines, and from that shelter kept up firing. The 4-pounders were then brought to play, and graped them. Thelineswerethenset fireto to drive themont, which was done. All this time the Sikhs stood spectators, drawn up inopenparade. Theythen wavered, first attempted to murder their commandant, Colonel Gordon, who was saved by one of his own men, who received the ball in his arm, and was immediately removed to the Mint. The Sikhs then sent a volley at the gunners, who wheeled their guns round and hammered them with grape; they were mowed down like rotten carrots, and bolted liko, the 37th. Mean. while Captain Guise, in command of the 13th Irregulars, called upon his troopers to charge, and went off at a gallop. Not a man stirred. Captain Guise was shot by the 37th, and it is said had his head split open afterwards by some of bis own troopers. Two other officers of the 37th, youngsters of only 1 6 and 18, were desperately wounded; one given up since. A third was wounded severely. 10 or 12 rank and file were kIlled and wounded, of whom we have burled three. It was a providential thing that we took the initiative, for otherwise thery would have risen at night, as afterwards diseovered, sad perhaps very few of us would have been alive to tell the tale. God has indeed been gracious to us, and by visible signs shownflispresence and protection to us. It is said the whole thing was precipitated, but if so It only shows that it was not man's judgment or foresight which saved us. Since our mutiny the SiklasatJaunporemutinled, and deliberately shot their eommanding officer. Only five minutes before they were shaking hands with the European residents and swearing to defend them with their lives. The reidents were congregated at the collector's office. Besides, Cappage, the joint magistrte, was murdered, and ThrespLand and his wife. 'These two latter were shot before a peon of mine. He says, they feU on their knees pleading for life-the reply vWs a volley which put an end to their existence. There were children too but no one knows what has become of them. The rest escaped to a factory whence they were resed by a pasty of volunteers, accompanied with 25 soldiers sent from here. The commandant's wife died through fight at the factory and was bhrled there. The other murdered ones lie at Jaunpore, unburied. I The 6th Native Infantry at Allshabadi subsequently rose at 9 o'clock at night, and have murdered nearly every one of their officers. They were at mess. The house was sur.- rounded and everyone ofthem butchered. Every otherman, woman, and child out of the fort have been most cruelly butchered. The fort is besieged, the bridge of boats broken up, and every boat burnt or sent out of the way. (Since contradicted.) We have sent detachments to the fort. They have got in and will hold it now. The last detachment of 50 were nea-ly murdered. They were attacked by more than 1,000; fortunately, a steamer was present, and ferried them into the fort, but to do this rhe was obliged to leave her flat behind. During her absence the flat was boarded by 200 miscreants. The pasengers took to flight in the jollyboats, and were picked up the next morning by the steamer. My last letter, received from Lucknow, was dated the 3d of June. The whole of the native troops there had * Pukka, means solid maa=-brck bmilt, and stone roofed. mnutnied and been joined by the cavalry. The whole count as risen as one man. The residency i beeged. The besieged ame bopeful, and expaect to hold out till rein. toreeLents arrive. They have been suffering for may months. Her Majesty's 32d are there, and Sir H. Lawrenee )z the best man in India they-coild have for the emergency. But yet the numbere ar few, and a hostile and fanatic' people are to be dreaded. G,d grant thAt they may hold out -otherwise fearfgl will be the butchery.' They have nigh upon 239 laies in the residency. Cawnpore is ia most ticklish state. They have but 500 Europeas. if so niany, with some artillery. They have intrenched themselves. So long as the telegraphic oom. municazLton was open the most urgent and repeated calls for reinforcemmens were being made. We had not any to give. We supplled 100 by deniding ourselves. At the outbreak here we had hbrdly 150 men on the parade-ground. Since tben more have been arriving, which we have sent on to Allbahabd. A steamer with 350 is expected to-day or to-morrow, but it goes up straight to Allahabad, which Will shortly be stocked with 1,000 men. Agra had thre native regiments and one Enropean. A portion of the Sepoys were sent to MNuttra to guard the treasure. These racals sent for another &ompeny from Agra and then " looted " the Treasury. Seeing this the remaining portion of the Sepoys at Agra were disarmed, but whatmatter? their comrades have got theplunder for them. Since then all communication with Agra has been cut off. The Ghoorkag at Simla have quietly taken pomession of the tation and the treasury; ditto Kssowwlee. ARl the ladies made a clean bolt to Dagbhhat, poor things, and have taken shelter in the barrack. The troops have all moved down to Delhi. Some of them ran down khudas, and, after 20 houns continual march, reached DaghshaL Others, on foot and ia every conceivable way, made their way to the same placoe with only what they had on their backs. Here we are hanging every day and the gibbet is in full work. We must deciminato the half of the population before we can get our prestige back. Next year will be a year of famine, I anticipate. Plague and pestilence follow. Every one, from the ryot to the zemindar, is plundering and murdering, and if this state of thing last where will be the harvest? I am afraid that from scarcity this city wil be hard to hold. The roads are all closed and there is no income of grain. Taking our or,n division only, Jaunpore, Azimghur, and C-onuhpore ae empty and burnt to the ground, but one offcia place; AIlahabad is a heap of ruins, and not one village but is out on a marauding expedition. The following letter is from the wife of Lieu. tenant C. Tucker, late of the 15th Irregular Cavalry. This gallant young officer was the only one belonging to the 15th Irregular Cavalry whose life was spared. The last accounts brought the tidings that he was safe at Benares, restored to his wife and child, but suffering from fever, consequent upon the perils which for 17 days he had undergone:- " Benares, June 27. "I wil tell you aU about Charlie as it happened. as I know youx wiU like to hear every particular. On the evening of the day I sent off your letters (my birthday, the 14th) one of the coolies I had sent with a letter to Sultanpore, returned with it, and one of our grooms with him, saying that on the 9th the troops at Sultanpore had mutiaied, that Colonel Fisher, Captain Gibbingg, and others had been killed, but that Charlie had escaped; but the groom did aot know where he had gone. You can fancy what a terrible state I was in. Mr. H. Tucker directly sent out in the Snltanpore direction, offering 1004 to whoever would bring him in. However, we could hear nothing of him till the following Wedaesday evening, when a man brought in a letter from him, saying that he and others were safe under the protection of a native gentleman about 14 miles from Sultanpore. A largo party of natives, with elephants, were sent out the next day to bring them in here. They arrived safely yesterday morning. It was at first proposed to send English gentlemen and soldiers for them, and Charlie's brother intended going too; but it was thought that Europeans would have attracted too much attention, and that the people in Oude would rise and cut them off, which most probably would have been the case had they gone, so al the most trustworthy ratives were selected instead. " I will now give you Charlie's own account of his escape. On the Sunday before the mutiny at Sultanpore (which was on the Tuesday morning) Charlie went out some distance to meet the wing of his regiment which he commanded at [Seetapore, and which was inclined to mutiny, to see if he could pacify the men; and he apparently did so, and. brought them, with the second in command, into Sultanpore on the Monday night late. About 8 o'clock on the Tuesday morning poor Colonel Fisher. while out, was shot thro gh the body by the native police. arlie - dlrey -woutn- tto. him,. dK ...aftez much. troubl, persuaded some of the men to get him into a dooly. He said he was d3ing; but Charlie took out the ball, and gave him some water. He then tried to persuade the regiment to come near their Colonel, but no one would obey any order. They were all under some trees close to our house. A party of them then made a rush ae Captain Gibbings, who was on horseback at a little distance, and killed him; and then the men shouted to Charlie to go away. H He found it was aU over then, and so rode off. Three men rode after him about a mile, and then returned. He thinks they must have wished to spare him, as they could esly have done anything they liked; but he was, I believe. a great favourite with the wing he commanded at Seeta pore. " He rode some distance, and ther got into a jungle, where he stayed a great part of the dy; but he had firt gone into a village, with one of his grooms who had got his mare, and who said he would take care of him, but Charlie found out that he meant to betray him; so he rode off. " Only fancy how dreadful it wns for hint to be wander. ing about in the heat of the day, not knowing where to go and getting people to give him water to drink at wells, and at last drinking it out of little streams, he was so terribly thirsty. At last, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he asked a man whom he saw for some water, and also if he could protect him, for he and his horse were both getting knocked up. The manu said he would, and took him into his vilage and afterwards to his master, who lived in a native fort, and who was the principal person in the place; and there Charlie ltayed until the party from here went to fetch him, His escape was most providential, for he did not know the peopleabout there. Soon after he had reached the native's house four others from Sultanpore arrived; but one of them knew the way to the person who took Charlie in. He muAt be a most noble-hearted native, for when we took Oude it half ruined, him. He is to have quantities of presents from Charlie, St George, Henry, and I believe from Government. "¢The ladies from Sultanpore aU escaped. Only four people were killed there-namely, Colonel Fisher, CaptaitL Gibbings, Mr. Blook, aud Mr. Strogan; the latter was one of those who were marrled when we were there. I am very sorry for his wife. Mr. Block was the only other married man of the four. All the houses in Sultanpore were burnt by the mutineers. They stole two or three boxes out of our house first, the groom said, and then burnt it, so we have lost every thing, except what I happened to have with me here and the carriage and horses, which had taken away some of the ladies, and the horse that Charlie was riding, which was the Arab that was bought originally for me when we first came to the country. At any other time I should have been dreadfully grieved, but now that Charlie bas been spared, when so many have been murdered, I cau only feel most thankful to the Providence that has watched over him and all of us in these terrible times," BRIGADE:R PONSONBY. TO THE JEDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Haviug read In 2%e Times of this morning the foL lowing pas=sge,-"It is singular that energy and power should be incapable of combinaion, but certainly recent events would seem to establish a paradox. Colonel Neil, with 137 men of Her Majesty's 10th Regiment, and 37 of the Madras Fnsileers, could establish order at Benares, and punish three regiments," &c., &c. I am anxious to remove an erroneous impression which this is calculated to produce, and am in a position to prove tha the attributes of "energy and power" were on the occasion of the mutiny at Benares combined in Brigadier Ponsonby, to whose foreslght and judgment much praise is due. I hope you will do me the favour to i,sert in your columns he subjoiaed etracts from a letter of Brigadier Ponsonbys, which, at the suggestion of several friends of this distinguished officer, I have the pleasure to send you. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, Brighton, Aug. 15. ' H. "Benares, June 13. "I despached my Inst letter on the 3d inst., and on the 4th most important events occurred here. The troops con- sisted of the 37th Regiment of Native Infantry, some 700 or 800 strong - the Sikh Regiment, one-half that number - the 15th Irregular Cavalry, 700 strong; and about 2 Europd%ns of Her Majesty's 84th and of the Madras Fusieers, with three guns manned by European Artillery.. men. *- Colonel Gordon, my second in command, an exeellent offloer, came to me and said he had been informed that the' men of the 37th were plotting with the bad characters in the city. We agreed to go to the oommiesioner, Mr. Tacker, who reqommended our going to Mr. Frederick Gubbine, the judge here. It then transpired that the men of the 37th wefe much implicated, and Gordon advised the regiment, X* Khuds are deep hollows, the bottoms of precipitous Imount slopea. I . 'hould be diarmed at once After some discuion I agreed We had no ti (it being betwreen 4 and 5p.m.) to los, and bUt little arrangement could be made (fortunately). I had l long drive and ride also through the sun, and udh a snn! I rorehed the Europeens and guns in front of the lines of the 37th, who were taken by surprise, with BrdguUoe. Handscomb's fate fresh 4n my mind. I halt4d the Europeans, and went up to the men cf &he main guard, 37th, told them they were ory required to lhy down their armt, and no ham should occur to them. They efused, said they had committed no fault; tbey ehouted to their courades who ran for their arms, and began to fire on ua. I then, hving joined the Europeanx, orderec them to openfire, andalhearfuWfade on both aides ensued. The Sikha prored traitors, as did the Irregulars, but a few ronds of grape from tbe guns and the sharp practieo of the Earopean sent them all fing In teror, throin a a their arms and accoutremeut, and escaping a they be could, Captain Guise the ofcer commanding the regulars, wvas shot bg m a the 37th, who somedaysagobeganto bost publicly in the city of the explo:t; the police eized him, and he wes tried and hanged with several others "Some of the 37th, of the Sikhs, and of the 13th rregu. lae did not join the mutineers, and are with u% " We have had two offioers wounded, one I fear mortally; aIn yter, poor fellow I one foot hua been ampuZ'telm _and hal d s unextracted from his hip.

"A great number have been murdered by the 6th Native Infantry at Allababad, and yet that regiment volumteered to be led against the mutineeru at Delhi!

From the driving and riding, ir the sun and the excesive fatigue I underwent on the 4th inst. I had something very like a coup de solei and wa eobled to make over the comm-nd to the next senior officer, but not untU everythin was quiet. I have been ill ever since, but am now much better, and am looking anxiously for the rains to mitigate this feasful heat (thermometer 93' or 94'), when I hope to gain strength AN ESCAPE FROM DELHI As my name has been recorded in the paper an murdered at Delhi on the 11th of May last, when the general musacre took place, I write the following, explAining the mirsculous escape I have had of my life, which may be interesting to my friends and others :-On Monday, the 11th of May, the sowar came from Mfeerut into Delhi and wreaked their vengeance by murdering the greater portion of the Europeans. The 38th Native Infantry, 54th, and 74th were ordered out with the artillery, bat being of the same mind as the sowars of the 3d Cavalry they offered no redstanoe, but told their officers that they had better fly with a little delay as possble. The ladies had been collected in the tower on the hill at Delhi, and when the danger became apparent I went to Brigadier Graves, then oommanding at Delhi, and volunteered to take a letter to Meerut to obtain the assistance of the European troops. Brigadier Graves gave me the letter, and after taking leave of my wife and three daughters in the tower, with the rest of theladies, I went to my house and assumed the garb of * fuqueer, colouring my face, hands, and feet. I madefor the Bridge of Boats across the Jumna, through the city; but on reaching I found the bridge broken. I returned towards the cantonmnent and tried to get across the river at a ferry near the powder magazine; but by this time the sowArs of the 3d Cavalry had roached the cantonment, and all the neighbouring villagers, Goojmrs and Jauts, wer3 rushing to plunder the cantonment; the houses were fired. and I despaired of being able to get to Meerut. I rushed across the parade ground, and vas fired at twice by the Sepoys. I got as far as the garden near the canal when I was seized by some villagers aud deprived of every particle of clothes I procesded, naked as I was born, towards Kurnaul, in the hope that I might overtake the officers and ladies who had fled in that direction, but before I had proceeded a mile I saw two sowars, who had evidently failed in overtakingtheir oficers. They rode up to me with drawn. swords, and exclaimed, "Ferungee I hy! maro, maro I threw myelf in a suppUcating position, and, being intimate with the Mshomedan religion, and speaking the Hindostanm, I commenced uttering the most profound praies in behalf of their prophet Mahomet, and begged they would. spare my life if they believed that Imam Mendhee would comne to iudge the world. I made every noral appel to: them . (after ecaping the first cut they made at my throat, which I did by falling down--they, being mounted, could not well reach me), my entreaties were listened to, and they let me go, saying, "Had you not asked for mercyin the name of theProphet, you should have died like therest of the Xsrsf. I was dreadfully excited and could scarcelystand, but as I feltthat I must proceed I continued my journmy. About a milo further Isgain met a lot of Mahomedaas, who rushed uptomeandsaid, "Here is aFerangee; killtheKaffirY They then said to me, " You Ferungees want to make us all Chrisians" They then drag6ed me awAy to a village about a mile or more from the road, and tied my arms beo hind me, after which one of them said, " Kurreem Box, go and fetch your sword, and we will cut off the Kaffies heed." While Kurreem Bnx was gone to fetch his sword that wasto launch me into eternity a cry of " Dhar, dhar." was made by the villagers, and the Mahomedans who were keeping me ran off to look aftertheir owninterests. Irashed offandran -with al my strength to the road again, and escaped from these unmerciful beings. I continued to run along the road towards Knzaul; I was again stopped by some ironsmiths who were employed in the Delhi magazine, when one of them id, " Sahib, don't fear, come with ire to my village, and I will ind you food; if you go on you will surely be murderod by the Mahomedans, who have turned out from the villages to rob and kill the Ferangees." I went with the ironsmiths to their house, and was most humanely an I kdndly treated, one giving me a dhotee, another a cap, another some milk and native bread; I felt my life was' safe, I was much excited and could scarcely speak; they gave me a cot, on which I lay down, but could not sleep. I told these people I was a doctor, and in consequence met with much greater attention. Oa the following morning the Chowdrie of the village sent for me, when the whole village assembled to see the " Ferungee Doctor " exhausted as I was, I had to answer a multitude of questions put by the people, bat, finding I was perfectly acquainted with their religion, language, and manners, they began to take Infinite interest in my life, and said they would protect me. While I was staying at this village I heard Dr. Wood, of the 38th Native Infantry, wasin a village some five or six miles off, at Summeypore; a man from this villeag came to me and said, A Dr. Wood Sahib is in my village. le requires medicines; as you lknow ali the native medicines, pray tell me what should be given." I prescribed, but I know not whether the medicines reached him. I also heard while at this village that Colonel Rlipley was lying wounded at the Ice-pits near the Parade-ground. I persuaded the villagers that he was a very great personage, and that if they would take him food and water they would be handsomely roquited by the Government for their humanity. They took him food forseveral days; but after I had left this village soma ten days I heard that one of the Sepoys had killed him on finding him at the Ice-pits. A few days after I was in the village of Badree it ws rumonred that all the Ferunges atMeeruxt, Umbalh, and Calcutta had been murdered, and that the King of Delhi had talken the govern ment, and that If any village concealed a Ferngee it would be death to the owners, and general ruin. The propfietors of Badree village pt alarmed at thiS proclamation, and I was removed at n5gnt from the village to a small mango tope, where I was left night and day alone. I was isited at night by some one or other of the villagers, who brought me breada nd wrater in a ghurab I am unable to descrbe my feelings during this trying time; I waass ll day in the sun, in the extreme heat, and alone at night, when the jackals, &c., came prowling about and crying. It is only God and myself know what I have en- durea A'fter five days and nights in this tope of trees I Ws ain tken back to the vilage and coneleod in a bhooea house; I was here shut in for 24 honrs; the heat and suffocstion I cannot find language to deacribe. I did not know which was the greatest misery, the tope of trees In solitude or the bhooa kotree A rumour now was sot on foot that several sowars haa been deputed to hnnt for the Ferungees in the different villages, and it 'was considered prudent that I should quit Badree under the escort of a Fuqueer Jogee; this man came and ogered to convey ma anywhere that I might please, but stated that it was not safe a moment for me to re- main where I was. I then started for Bursooeh, where I remained thenight, This Faqueer at his friend's dyed all my clothes and gave me neeklaces of beeds (oodrach), &c., to amme the garb of a Fqueer myself. After making all preparations to pam as a Fuqqeer I commenced my pil gdmage with him. H4 took me to several villages and pased me off as a Cashmeeree, " Dadoo Puntee, Fuquoer Jogee." In all the villages that I pased I ws cros5questioned, but, understanding their " Jotish" religion and oaths, I petwith everT kindness, some giving me pice, other3 food. . doogallexpressed the most merifulseengs towrards t*Teriiees, whilete the ahomedns eould notd4 4. guaise th~it urderousfeelings.

While I wag sitting at tW8 k' quee's place a Sepoy camne, saying he hd letters which he was taking to the UmbAllah foroe that was at liee. He did not diCover that I was a Ferungee, but I disclosed to him (bit I was a Doctor Sahib,-would he take my letter to the officer commanding the force? I gave hlm' a lqtter soliciting assistance, which he most faithfUlly 0onveyed, but, after waiting a day in hopes of gotting afistanoe, and none cousing, I thought it prudent to proceed OWards Mfrut. The beggar-who hadt conducted me thus far volunteered to take me on. Several people of this vil. lae acoompanied me til we got to Hurchui;dpore, where a Mr. Francis Cohen, a Zemtndar (originally a Tassildar, in tho Government employment), resides. Tbis old gentle. man received me in all kindness, and showed me cerUfia; cates under the signatures of Colonel Kuyvett, Captain Salked, Ieautenant Hollnd, Mr. ldarshall, merchant, of Delhi and others, setting forth that they had receiveOd every kindness from Mr. Cohen, who had kindly sent them on to meerut. I then made arzangement3 to proceed to feerut, when a letter was brought from Kaykrah Village to my address, teling me that 100 men of the Jheend Rajah's force, commanded by Captain M'Andrews, was waiting at Kaykrah to take me on to l(aee, where the head-quarters were, Mr. Cohen sent me back in his cart, and I kgain had the gratification of seeing Captain WAndrews and Lieutenant eaw of my own regiment. I had been 25 days wandering about in villages, topes, &c., and were it not that I speak the Hindostani language aB fluently as I can Engish I must have been murdered. I look upon my escape as the most mirao-ulonr and providential posible. Iam unable to describe wbht t Lave endured. I am living, and at Delhi with the force, and am truly thankfu- to the Almighty for the mercy-that hm been shown me. My wife and children, I hear, are at Kussowlee. Yours faithfally, S. H. BATSON, Surgeon of the late 74th Native Infantry. Delh, Junse IL THE JHANSI MASSAC'IRE. TLe following is the evidence of a Sowar (Nujamooddeen), of two clas81es belonging to Bhugwandose's (native jemadar's) establishment, and of one classie of MIahomed Issaers (native jemadar's) establishment. All four were shut up in the fort with the gentlemen, and on their release thence, on the 10th inst., came to MAlshoba and related the ocCurrences - Nagode, June 25. For some time since the gentlemen had been in the habit of passing the nights in the fort, and spending the days at their bungalows. Captain Burgess and his establishment had their tents pitched within the fort, and everything was being put In readiness to retreat into tho fort so aoon as there should be oocasion to do so, which occurred on the evening of the 4th of June. Some few effected their escape from the place altogether, one gentleman (name unknown) reached Burwar Sagar, when meeting with a native saurveyoof the canal esablishment, Sahib Rai, he gave hin hui watch and horse, and procuring a Hindostauce dress escaped oe foot. He was scarcely oat of sight when two Suwars, Who were hotly pursuing him, arrived there, and, recognizing the horse, took Sahib Rai and the Thanadar prisoners (bound) back to JhasLd, where they were s5til when last heard of. Iaeutenant Tarmball was not so fortunate, as not having been able to gain the fort, ho climbed a large tree. He had, however, been seen, and was shot In the tree. From the evening of the 4th until noon of the 8th the gentlemen in the fort kept good their position, the ladles assisting them in cooldng for them, sending themn refreshments, casting bunets, &c. There were 55 in number altogether (Europeans), inclusive of the ladies anl children, and they began to get very much straitened for want of pro visions, &e. Behind all the gates they had piled high bhaps of stones to strengthen them, and kept up so good a defence that one of the cannon which had been brought too near the gates was abandoned, and it was only by fixing ropes to it in the night time that the mutineers were able to regain possession of it. Lieutenant Powys was the firat person killed in the fort, The way he met his death was this:Two men, brothers, in Captain Bargess's employ (one was his jemadar) declared that they would go out. They were told they would be shot down ff they attempted it, but theyFAid they might as well be shot as stay there to be starved, and accordingly oommenoed undoing the fastenings. One ws shot immediately; the other turned on Lieutenant Powye, who happened to be near him, and cat him down with Mis talwar. This one alao was directly shot by Captain Burges The only other person kldled inside the f6rt *As Captain Burgess himself, who received a bullet in thethe#d after having. I m told, wlth his own hand, killed iho lees than 25. All the natives spoke 6f his great skill as a marks man. The mutineers at htt, having forced the Raneo to asSist them with guns and elephants, succeeded in effecting an entranoe at two of the gates, and they promised the gentlemen that if they laid down their arms, and gave themselves up quietly, their lives should be sparod. The gentlemen unfortunately trusted to their word and came out. They were tied in a long lne between some trees, and after a short consultation had their heads struck off. Such ladies as had children had to see them cut in halves before their own turns came. The Snwars, it appears, bore the principal part in all these atrocities. This took place on the afternoon of the 8th June. C. D. KIRCHOEF, Sergeant and A. 0. The Sergeant thus gives his own personal experience:- Jubbalpore, July 2. The system of pampering, petting, flattering, and coaxing the Sepoys and natives generally, which has been the fashion ever since I have been ill the service (and I can bear testimony to some 18 years), has at last borne its faU fruit. Our prestige in India is lost for the present, and an army of 50,000 Earopeans will be required to restore it We have little to thank our masters for. Their system has been to exalt the native and lower the European, and so effectually have they done so that the former is now tying his hand at runlig us. Out of evil, however, good sometimes comes. The death-kneU of the Government which leaves its servants to be helplessly masacred must soen sound. Those iniquitous Black Acts mnst be put by for another century; that beautiful fabric of native magistraoy must be demolished, and the army must be disciplined. Offioers who come to India to be soldiers must not look upon their regiment as a punishment, escape from which is the first step towards suncess in their career. An officer must be ani offioer, not a schoolmaster, or an inspector, or a thiefcatcher, or a gardener, or a tamer of wild beasts, or anything, in fact, exoept a soldier. On the morning of the 15th the party from Nowgong,oonsiating of the undermentioned gentlemen, &a., arrived at Bbhoba :-Maor Kirke, Captain Scott, B.J,; Lieutenant Townshend, Artillery; Lieutenant Jackson. adjutant; IAeutenants Remington, Ewart, Franks, andBarber; Xr. Kirke, the major's son; Dr. and Mrs. mdawe and child, Mr. Jobnson, adjutant's writer; (Mrs. Johnson was taken off by the Sepoys at Now-gong); Mr. Langdale, writer; Mrs. Langdale, Bullock-Sergeant Kaite, Mr. Smalley, bandmaster; mr SmaUey and child; Sergeant-Major Lucas, Mrs. Lucas and two children; about 20 bandmen and their families, several native officers, and 87 -non-commissioned officers and men of the 12th, and one Artilleryman. Mr. Sturt, an asitan' pztrol, who had escaped from the Jhansf district, arrived in Mahoba a oouple of days before the party, and hearing that they were at Chutterpore joined them there, but returned with them on the 15th. Sergeant Kirchhoff and Mrs. Kirehhoff also joined the party on their arrival in Mahoba. On their arrival at Mahobs the Sepoys expressed great dissatisfaction at not finding Mlajor Kirke there, he having left the party suddenly the day previous, without giving any one any notioe, and had not since been heard of. Captin Scott and Lieutenant Townshend having also lelt the party at Piperah to return to lNowgong to see after some mens stores, &c., the men were murmuring that all their offioers intended leaving them grzduslly, and they expressed a determination not to leave Mahoba until they had found their major. Fortunately, word sras brought fromChtkare that Major Kirke had taken refuge there, anda most pressyig letter having been sent to him to return to Mahobh had the desired effeoct. He arrived there on thb evening of the 16th, and, the other two officers aBo return. ing from Nowgong on the same or the next 'day, prepara'tions were made for a march in the direction (I believe, bet am not slre) of Nagode. We left Mahoba on the evening of the 17th, and ater a rather long march encamped undee X some hill During the day (1lth) Mr. Carne, the eollector of Mahoba, brought out 2ome money (2,000 rapees I believe s the sum) which had been applied for to tho Churkaree Rajah. This fact was evidently known by a large party of dacoits, who mustered in foroe on and behind the hills be. neaths which wo lay encamped, as during the day they sent aqnecageQ to say that unless 1,000 rupees were paid down to them they would not allow the party to pass.

They had also Dr. Mawes's child with them, and I believe wetut off in a direct line towards Bands. It was only after mnany very narrow espes and after killing three of our ss ntg at we managed to get away from the remainder. After being pursued by nerly every village near which we showed ourelves, and suffering dreadfuly from want of water, we st lat rechep the Cane river, and were intending to rest for a time In an apparently very selded spot which we bhd hit upon to refreh both ourslves and our hones; but Ina very short time we found we were again set upon, and had to make a run for it again.

Fort hibhw, July O' On the morning of the lit inst we reoeived a& uesti from the eseddent at Indore tht he was attacked bythe Maharajah's troops. We pnt off a troop of our cavalsy, with all our guns, to assist him; but when they had reached within four miles of Indore taey got a letter from the lesi dent, yingthat he hsd been. bliged toretire. The guns returned agin to Mlhow. Then Colonel Platt marcbed them into the fort, took precautionary measures, and all the ladies and non-combatauts epme into it. This, I must tell you, happened while I was out, for immediately the guns came in from their march I was sent out with 30 men on the Indore road as arradvanoed picket, because we anticipatec an attack from Holkars troopL. I was about eight mileS from hihow, and in time, about 7 o'clock pm., a fresh batch of 30 mnen came to relieve those I took out; but we being short of officers I could not be relieved, and I was told to top out all night. The first batch retired, leaying me with the fresh men, with whom I conversed, as I liked the men, and I fanded they liked me. Aboat 9 o'clock p.m. a man came galloping up from the station, and told zue X wss to bring my picket nearer; of course we mounted, ant away we trotted till we came to the bridge, which is about a mile and a-half from our cavalry lines, which are on' the extreme right. By the time we reached the bridge and, I bad posted my videttes it was about 10 o'clock. I thon at down and talked to myjemadar, all the men lying dqwn, holding their hores. In about two minutes I heard a shot from the direction of the station, then another, and'another, and so on. I took no appaent notioe of ti, but got- np and auntered away soal toget to the end nearest the sation; my horse, held all eAdY, as is nAui on picket, was at that end. I still ctinued talking, bat now to the hiavMldar and oue or two others. All h time the firing at the station was very brisk, and I remarked that they uDust have been attacked by the ahjsha's fore."; and the men replied, "Yes, it must be so, *ertainy."

THE MUTINY AT ALLAHABAD. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMIES. Sir,-I have read with great interest the various inform&a tion imparted by your columns from sources of private communication delivered to you respecting details of the Bengal mxutineers, and I feel it to be a daty to contribute the ixtelligence which I have this morning received from my son, who holds the chief civil authority at AfUahabad, of the sad scenes which had trananlw -f. thnb n,-Ir+- place. X. y. z. " June 21. "I am still safe, and will give an account from the 5th of June. Early on that day I got a telegraph meisage from I Sir H. lawrence, telling us to keep every European. in the fort until aU 'was secure. It was the last message received. Almost immediately after I received notice that telegraphic commincaltionwas intoerrupted. Two hours after that it was cut off at Benares. I at once ordered every nonmilitary resident Into the fort, and ia the evening we enrolled ourselves into a militia, and arsued ourselves with carbines and ammunition from the magazine. The night of the 5th passed off quietly. On the morning of the 6th I returned to may house, and felt very reluctant to leave home, but fortu.ntely I did so, to take my place in the volunteer corps. " At 9 20 p.m. we heard a voley of musketry. The guard at the gate sounded an alarm and we rushed to our posts and the drawbridges were drawn up. In 20 minutea the officer l! charge of two guns which were posted at the Bridge of Boats to opposel rebels expected from Benares rode up and told us the company of the 6th Native Infantry which were posted there had seized his guns and gone off to cantonments. We had then in the fo rt a company of that regiment at the main gate and foar companies of a Sikh Regiment, 65 inva. lids who had arrived a day or two before from Chanar, and about the same number of ourselves. We found the com e pany of the 6th Native Infantry had loaded their muskets The first thing to do was evidently to disarm them. The Sikbs hesitated, and this was the most painful time. Any hesitation would have lost us the fort. " Major Brazier, who cornmanded the Sikhs, kept among them. We brought up three 9-pouaders loaded with grape and the volunateers surroanded the whole. The Gth lo3t heart, and gave up their arms. T o prevent a rush we sawed off the stocks, threw the bayonets into the river, and then turned them out. The Sikhs, who at first hesitated, marohed off to their several stations on the ramparts, one guard osly remaining at the gate. The fort was saved, and will I hope be the stay of Upper India yet. Shortly after Colonel Simpson, cormmanding the 6th Native Infantry, rode up with a few of his officers. We learnt from him that tha 3d OndeIrregular Cavalry had gone; Lieutenant Alexander, who commnded them, and whom I left an hour or tw, before in high spirits, had been killed, if not by his own men, by the 6th, with their consent; that Plunkett Stewart, Hawes, Pringle, Monro, six young ensigns doing duty with the 6th, and about 25 other Europeana-men, women, and children-had been murdered. Shortly after their arrival flame after flame appeared-the bungalows were burning. "The night p.ssed in painful anxiety, bub safely. Detach ments of the Madras Fusileers arrived the next day and days following, and we were perfectly secure, when a godown was discovered full of wine, spirits, and beer. The &lkhs broke loose from aU restraint and regularly plundered It. Not only wine and beer, but goods of all kinds were pluandered. Organs, pianog, carriages and buggies, goods of every kind, are lying about broken and destroyed. The liquor obtained was purchased freely by Europeans, and drunkenness ruled the day. Cholera, disease, and death followed, and our security 'wm gone. " Colonel -up to this time commanded, and I never knew such a maes of imbecility. He allowed all this, not of lhis own will, but from an idea that he could not stop it. He did nothing against the rebels, from an idea that he had not the means of acting. At this critical moment Colonel Neilarrived with orders to take the command, though junior and things changed like magic. On the 19th cholera was so fearful in the fort that all non-rmilitary residents were turned out. "The 6th behaved worse than any reglment. They volun teered against the rebels to deceive us. On the 6th of June a general order of the Governor-General, thanking them, ws received by them with cheers, and an hour and e, half afterwards they were shooting their own officers, bukhering women and children, burning our bungalows, and plunder. Ikg our property. They actually sounded the alarm to oollect their officers on parade, and showed no signs of disaffection until they were all collected, when they com. menced wholesale murder, the band playing the nstional anthem. We have been able from the fort to rescue 56 Europeans, and I expect 23 others to-morrow. I got In the Svltanpore people, but at Fyzabad they have all been murdered. I expect the Salone people, including my oll friend and subordinate Carnegy, to-morrow. I am not a6le to give one twentieth of what has happened in a letter. I am worked night and day getting information, supplies, carriage, &cc. We want to form outposts towards Cawn. pore, to clear the fort as much as possible, and help outsiders; and Cawnpore, if not fallen.

"At Allahabad we are pretty secure, and if the Sikh Regiment is removed, as I hope it will be, we shall be quite safe. To-morrow part moves out towards Cawnpore, to be followed immediately by 400 or 500 Europeans and three guns, to open the country and relieve Cawnpore, where General Wheler was holding out on the 20th. Eis defence bas been a most splendid one. In an intrsnched camp, his force consists of barely 300 men, his camp containing as rany, if not more, women and children. He has no sup. plies but grain and sugar; hemmed in by 5,000, and battered by one 24-pounder, one 18-pounder, and fOur 6-pounders since the 6th inst. On the 15th he made a sally, spiked one of the 6-pounders, and on the 17th repulsed two attacks made on him by the enemy, and destroyed many of them.

They were near Cawnpore when he got hold of them, tied them together one by one, and matilated them. An infant of a month old he took from its mother's breast, pretended to fondle, and then cut it into pieces. I am certain that Euch a man will not pass unpunished. "Lucknow is far more secure. Sir H.

The troops then bad a parade at n o'clock (of their own order. ing); they had possession of the pns, and at once fired all down the lines.

The Sikhs are more faithful; their regiments of iffantry and cavalryof 100 and 50 years' standing. The Bombay troops, also Madras, are still stanch. There never was any love lost between our Eindostanee native troops and the native Sepoys of these Presidencies. " Five or six European regiments from Burmah, Madra, and Ceylon have already gone up ounatry. A movable column of Engllsh troops and Royal Artilery is marching forward at Allahabad, and in a month or two I hope will be able to act in the Doab of the Ganges, and Jumna, and ian Lucknow, or Oude country, also in Rohilcund. Delhi, the capital of Upper India, and one of our principal maga. zines, which was seized by the mutineers, who set up the pageant of a Great Mogul as their King and Emperor, has fallen to our troops. Seven thousand of the Sepoy mutinears are said to have fallen deeperately defending It! This will be a sad blow to them, for it was the only magazine in their possession, and now they are deprived of their great munitions of war. The Allalabad assassinshave been well punished by Colonel Neill, and our Regiments of Enghsh Madras Fusileers, the 78th Highlanders, aud84th, also64thand37thQueern'sareall on their way there, also ha1f of the 35th; the other half of thatregiment I have here. I am afraid the heavyrains that have now commenced will prevent rapid movements, but the native Sepoys have quite a horror of marching about in the rains, whereas we can collect all our troops by our steamboats on the Ganger, and our troops will not be exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather; besides the mutinous troops have no European medical officers or medicine. Cholera has broken out among them, and their only chance of safety will be dispersion to their homes with what. ever plunder they may have secured, which, no doubt, they will bury under the earth for some distant and fuaurs day, "The Joudpore Legion has marched to Ajmeer and Nusgeerabad, for the troops at tkh latter station, as weU as at Neemutch, had mutinied. Sincerely do I pray that the Joudpore Legion will be true. As European troops are with it and Delhi has fallen, I hope it will not be tempted to follow the bad example that has been set to it. More than idO regiments Regular and Irregular Cavalry and Infantry, but very few of Artillery, have mutinied. " The whole Indian army must be remodeled or reorgardzd, and half of it must be Englishmen. The couatry must be thrown open to colonization. No more petting of .the murderers of women and children.

RRPOBT on the PURCHASB aniz SALE of ARMY A blne-book of nearly oO0 pages, yesterday published, contains the report of the Royal Commissioners appointed to inquire into the purchase and sale of oommissions in the army. The report itself is brief. The commissioners commence with a history of the system of purchase; they thea describe the present mode of entering the army, and they next review the objections made to the purchage system. Hlavlng stated these, the commissioners, on the opposite sdde, feel bound to state that the prevalent opinion among military men, as far as their views have been ascertained, is favourable to the system, or at least to its maintenance until some scheme shall have been devised whieh may produce the beneficial results 'wbich are com. manly ascribed to the system of purchase. The echef advantages are said to be that it facilitates the retirement of officers, and so accelerates promotion in the army, which would otherwise stagnate in time of continued peace; and that it also affords to officers a seeurity against the Influence of favour, enabling each officer to obtain his advancement by his own means, without; being dependent on tha goodvAII of the Government or the patronage of the higher authorities. The commissioners examine the question at length, and they afterwards refer Ito the system pursued in India and France. A plan of Sir C. Trevelyan!s for the abolition of the system of purchase, the general principle of which is borrowed from the Frenach military system, is next set forth. The report in. forms tho public that any general scheme of promotion by selection would not be favourably received by the officers of our own army, and would be equally offensive to the purchasing and non-purchasing corps. Neither would the prin. ciple of promotion by seniority be available, regard being had to the efficiency of the army. The commissioners proceed, on the whole, to recommend that theprincipleof selection be applied to the highest ranks in the service; that hereafter the lientenaut-coloneloy of a regment should cease to be purohaseable, and that the Commander-in-Chief should make the appointment of lieutenant-colonel from all the mnajors in that branch of the service; and that the period of holding the command ofl "lieutenant-colonel " should be limited to eight or ten years at the most. " By retaining the system of purchase up to the rank of field-officer," the report observes, "the outlet for the retirement of majors, captains, and lieutenants will continue as at present. The current of regimtental promotion will not be retarded, while, on the other hand, alimitation of the period during which the same officer shall hold the command of a regiment will tend to accelerate promotion." Thus, the whole system of purchae a-nd sale of commissions is (for the present) to romain intact up to the rank of major inclusive. Sir De Lacy Evans concurs in the report of his feUow- commiasioners as far asit goes, but he intends to hand in some suggestions for a speedier termnation of the purchase-system than is at present contem. plated.
SPORTING I YTLLDIOzzxyc TATTERSAIJ'S. MOrn7AV So manyhorses have of latb been introduced into the bet. ting simply for money-getting purposes that the very little business now-a-days transaDted at the Corner excites no surprise. Backers and layers are equally shy. The movements relative to MoIngrel for the Ebor Handicap and Saunterer for the Great Yorkshire Stakes show that Lord Derby did not geatly libel racing men when he stated in his memorable letter to the Jockey Club that horses were used merely as the instrumnents of gaming. About ldongrel for the Ebor Handicap anyprice might have beea obtained, while 100 to 6 and 100 to o were laid against Saunterer (p.p.) for the Great Yorkshire Stakes.

I AOEY-MARKBETand OITYINKTlRIGBffoBE. Mondsy Evening. The funds have again been firm to-day, at a further advance. Consols for money, which left oE on Saturday at 91i to i, were firt quioted 911 to #, and subsequently for e, moment touched 91i. This rise induced Several realizations, and there was then a temporary reaction to 91 j to j, but the market soon regained its tone, and the final transactions were at 91i to g- for money, and 91i to i for the 9th of September. Money was in full supply, for loans on Government securities at from 4 to 5 per cent., and in the discount-market at a fraction below the Bank minimum. Bank Stock closed at 214 to 216; Redueed, 919 to i; New hree per Cents., 914 to i; Ildia Stock, 212 to 213; -India Bonds, 22s. to 18s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. The foreign stock-market has been quiet throughout the day, speculation being principally confined to Turkizh, in which there was a reaction from the Jo-te advance. Peravian Four-and.a-Half per Cents. were negotiated for the account at 82i; Mexican 22R; Portuguese, for the account, 454; ditto, 1856, 46k; Spanish Certificates, 5j; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 956, i, i, and 95; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99s and 4; ditto, for the account, 99t and ; Dutch Two-and-aEHalf per Cents., 64; ditto, Four per Cent. Certificates, 99 and 99i; and Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Dollar Bonds, 56. In the corn-market this mnorning there was an advance of 2s. The fnal quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 15c. for money and 67f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing in the former case an advance of an eighth. The possible disturbance of our Indian trade is a serious question, but the vague alarm it awakens would be mitigated by a little calm calculation. The danger, according to the first impression of its magnitude, is that a market for seven or eight millions sterling of our exports mav be entirely stopped, a-d that specie instead of goods will be demanded of us. After the drain we have experienced for three or four years past this would indeed be an embarrassin& prospect. But it ;exists only in imagination. Even taking the altogether improbable supposition that the produce henceforth to be shipped from India will suffer no diminution, and that the natives, in their terror, wiU accept in payment for it nothing but silver that they can hoard, the dimensions of the evil would be much smaller than most persons suppose. On the seven millions of goods which we send to Calcutta we can hardly assume there is a profit of more than 1,050,0001., or 15 per cent. The balance may be regarded as the value of the raw produce and of the labour consumed in its mianufacture and transportation. If we no longer require this raw produce we of course instantly lessen our purchaees of it. and the loss from the stoppage of the trado is proportionably thrown upon foreign countries. If India will not buy cotton cloths, America, which produces the staple, will suffer from that fact much more even than England; while, as regards the lessened employment of our operatives, nopermanent inconvenience would be threatened, as ever since the Australian discoveries the supply of labour has been short of our requirements. A moderate reduction of wages would be followed by a rather diminished consumption of imported luxuries,which would tend to avert drains of specie in otber directions, but would certainly lead to nothing like general distress. As to the produce of India, in whatever quantities it might continue to come, we should take it only at prices at which we could make a profit from it. Looking at the matter, therefore, in ita worst aspects, there is nothing to excite uneasiness. Doubtless individual firms would suffer, as is always the case in anyrevolution in business but the effects experienced bythe nation would be alght. There is no ground to assume that our aggregate trade, except perhaps during the first few months of the crisis, wiE be at al disturbed as regards amount. According to every probability the exports of India wil be quite as extenaively interfered with as her imports, and consequently the balance to be paid to that country in specie will be much as before, while in proportion as she sends us short supplies other countries wiU be stimulated to produce them, and these countries in their increased prosperity will require augmented consignments from us in return. It is this power of turning from market to markAt and of adapting tbemselves to aU changes that constitutes the irrepreesible grandeur of a free commercial community. The wants of the world are always increasing, although the activity of particular districts may wane, and a people who have no exclusive relations, but who are ready to deal on terms of equality with all mankind, can never sustain much damage from anything but a universal convulsion. However much it might mortify our self-esteem if we were swept out of India to-morrow, there is reason, from past experience, to believe that the Board of Trade returns for future years would continue to excite no less surpriso than heretofore. It is the people of India and not of Great Britain that have to look with dread on the miseries to bo experienced from the check to civilization and isdustrial advancement that must be consequent on the disastea of 1857. The specie from New York to-day is 183,6001., the greater portion of which will be sent to the Bank of France. The advices on this occasion describe unlsual ease in the money-market, the rate on call having been as low as 6 per cent. Most descriptions of securities howeser had experienced a renewed decline. Erie Railway was quoted 32, Reading 70, and New York Central 811 to 82. Panama and Illinois Central had improved-the former to 98, and the latter to 119. The abundance of the wheat harvest was now beyond question, and most other crops promised at least a full average. About 8,0001. in Russian gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The rate of discount at Hamburg has again risen to 7 per cent. in consequence of further amounts of bar silver having been exported to London. At present prices these silver shipments would leave a loss. Owing to the breaking of the cable, the 1,0001. shares of the Atlantic telegraph, on which 9001. has been paid, are now offered at 2501. discount. Jast before the accident there were buyers at S1. discount. The reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week show a good general business. At Manchester the markets have been steady, and since the arrival of the Overland MaN there have been some purchases for India. The Birmingham advices are favourable as regards the iron trade, the orders from America having increased, while in some of the general manufactures of the place there is remarkable aniimation. At Nottinghamthis is usually a dull season. In the voollen districts the state of prices induces caution, but there is no want of confidence. The rih linen mnarkets have been heavy. ln the general business of the port of London during the past week there has been increased activity, the arrivals from the Baltic having been very large. The number of ships reported inward was 317, being 150 more than the previous week. These included 16 with cargoes of sugar, one from Hongkong with tea, and the unusually large number of 100 with cargoes of grain. The total number of vesels cleared outward was 151, including 25 in ballast, showing an increase of 15. Of those cleared outward five are for Shang,hai direct, and two for Hongkong. The annexed is from the United Mexican Mining Association:- "'Under date Guanaxuata, Julyl3, MajorFarrell writes:Mine of Jesus Maria y Jose.-The works in the upper part of the mine, known prinSipally as those of San MAxarno have improved as well in quality as quantity since rmy last, the especially favourable feature being the good ley of geld.

BAIL WA Y AND MINING SIABE$. Monday Evening. The railway market opened this morning atia further improvement, which was not, however, faUy maintained to the close. Eastern Counties, Sheffield, and North-Eastern stocks advanced; on the other hand, North-Western was slightly lower, and a heavy fall occurred in Caledonian, continuing after official hours. Great Western receded in the morning, but afterwards recovered, and closed the same as on Satarday. East Indian Eastern Bengal, and' Cweylon were rather better, while a Slight deoline took place in Great Indian Peninsula and Great Western of Canada. Grand Trunk of Canada fluctnatod considerably during the day, a transaction being marked at 49k; but the last quotation vwas 50 to 52, showing no alteration at the close. Great Central of France, Southern, and Namur and Liege were in better demand; Sambre and MIeuse and Lyons slightly receded. In Peninsular and Oriental Steama there was a rise of ii.

Lord CAMPBELL presented a petition from the provost, tnagistrates, and town council of Cupar, Fife, in favour of the Boudaries of Burghs Extension (Scotland) Bill, vwith fhe exception of one clause. The Earl of EARROWBY Presented a petition from the Vollege of Dulwich against some of the amelldments made in the Commons in the Bil relating to that iustitation. The LORD CFANCELLOR presented a petition from -0artsin shareholders in the Royal British Bank in reference to the Commons' Amendments of the Joint-stook Companies Bill. Lord ST. LEONARD'S presented a petition on the same Subject ; but the quarter from which it emanated was not -auible. JOINT-STOCK CO0IPANIES BILL. On the order of the day being read for the consideration 0of the Commons' amendments to the Lords' amendments to Ohi Bill, The LORD CHANCELLOR said, he proposed to assent to th r,ain point in dfspute vith respct to this Bil bewegn their lordships' House and the House of Commons. * the question had reference to the Tipperary Bank. The objeci of the Bill was to effeet a compromise between share. holders and creditors of joint-stock companies, and un- ouestonably such a BiUl was in one sense not just, inasluch as it interfered with the rights whioh parties had as the law now stood. At present every creditor of such a -company night bring an action against any or every share. holder in it. The Bill proposed to enable a certain propor tion of the creditors to make arrangements wbich should bind the whole. In the case of the Tipperary Bank a divi. -deed of 2s. in the pound had been paid, and it was provided by the Bill, as it passed their lordships' House, that the judgment creditors should be left to enforce their judgments 1! tbey chose, but that if they did so they should be bound to ,gve up the 2s. in the pound they had received as dividends and sbould not receive any future dividend until all creditors had been paid pan- paeu. In the Rouse of Commons, howev-er, it was proposed that those creditors who had received 2s. in the pound should keep that amount, and should still be enabled to enforce their judgments, but it was provided that they should not receive any further divi. -dend or issue any process except by leave of the court. Re thought it might be reasonable to allow the dividenid of 2s. In the pound to be retained by those creditors who had re-ceived it, but he moved that their lordships should insist 'Upon their proposal that such creditors should not be en-titled to receive any further dividend, or to have recourse to any other remedy than could be obtained in respect of the judgments against lands. Lord ST. LEONAP.D'S was understood to say that he entirely concurred in the alterations which had been Made by the House of Commons. The power left to thejudgment creditors was very carefully guarded, for it was provided, as some of themn had received a dividend of 2s. In the pound, they shotld not be entitled to any further dividenld, or have the right to issue any process against the shareholders, ex:cept by leare of the court, until all the other crtditors were paid in full. Afttr some further conversation the House divided on the Lord Chancellor's motion:- The numbers were, - Contents ... ... ... ... ... 11 -Not-contents .. ... ... ... ... 9 Majority ... ... . -2 The motion was therefore agreed to. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS BILL. The Commons' amendments to this BUi were agreed to. DULWICE COLLEGE BILL The Earl of HARROWBY moved that their lordships should aisagree to the Commons' amendments respecting the constitution of the governing body of the college. This House liad adopted the scheme proposed by the Charity Eomzissioners, by which the governing body was to consist Of four persons chosen by four London parishes, and eloven by the Court of Chancery. The House of Commons, howeover, aittred this scheme, entrusting the management to sight persons chosen by the parishes, two by the magistrates, and tbree by the Archbishop of Canterbury, three others meing tho President and Vice-President of the Council of Xducstion and the President of the Poor Law Board. The result ot this constitution would in all probability be that the eight persons last mentioned would not attend with any regulb t ity, and that the eight persons named by the parishes would possess the sole management of the charity. So inioortabt a trust, he thought, ought not to be confided to a body tbus constituted ; and he therefore proposed that their lordsh ips should adhere to the composition of the governing body as suggested by the Charity Comnmissioners, and as -adoptt d by this House, and should disagree with the amendruents in clauses 3, 4, 5, and part of clause 6. With this and anotber less important exception he should not object to the vemaining amendments. Lord CAlPBELL said, the main object in such a oase =should be to observe what it might be supposed would be the wishes of the founder. Now, the constitution of the overn mg body proposed by the Charity Commissioners was, ie believed, just that w hich Aullyne hilmself, could he start irons his grave, would approve; and he therefore quite concurred in the motion of his noble friend (the Earl of Barrow by ). The motion was then agreed to, LUNATICS (SCOTLAND) BILL. This BDil was read a third time and passed, with amendmaents. The Burial Acts Amendment Bil, Boundaries of Burghs Extension (Scotland) Bill, Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Act Am.-ndajent Bill, and Married Women's Reversionary Interest Bill, were severally read a third timo and passed. The hLusleslastical Commission Bill passed through comtittee. Several Bills, including the Appropriation Bill, were brought up from the Comumons and read a first time. The LORD CHANCELLOR gave notice that he would on the Yellowing day move that the standiDg order with regard to the bringing up of Bills from the liouse of Comraons be dispensed with in reference to the Irish Testatnenlary Bill aud the Revising Barr,sters8(Dublin) 1ill. Lord cl'EDESDALE ould not object to the order being dispensid with in regard to the Irish Testamentary Bil, bat there was no reason that the Revising Barristers (Dublin) RBll, to the principle of which he had strong objections, should iuot nave been introduced long ago. After a few words from Earl GRANVILLE, Lord CAMPBELL said, that in England the appointment -o revi,in,t barristers was vested in the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench. A similar power should be vested in the -Chief Jmsticb of the Queen's Bench in IrelaDd. Their lurdships then adjourned at half-pas. 6 o'clock.
IIOrJSE OF COMMONS, MONDAY, AUGUsT 17. The SPEAKER took the ohair at 12 o'olock. MlERSEY CONSERVANCY BILL. Sir J. GRAHAM begged the attention of the House for a few ulinutes upon a private Bill of great local and public Interest. The Mersey Conservancy Bill received the sanotion of the House upon the second reading without a division; it vas referred to a select committee over whioh he presidtd, and the inquiry before them occupied 25 days. .wo priuciples were laid do:-1. That the managerent -of the Liverpool Docks should be transferred to a trust, -eleoted hy ratepayers; 2. That all dues levied for harbov,urposes shotld be applied to the purposes of the harborn. The amnount of harbour dues last year was 160,0001., and the great question in the transfer of the management from the (Crporation of Liverpool qua Dock Trustees to the now trust was the extent to which the council ahould be rlioeved from the debt upon the dock fund. The Committee -of this House, after grave consideration, thought fit to award a sum of 760,0001. au the portion of debt to be transforred to the Dock Tirut, and on the third reading of the 33l the recommenoation was afflirmed by the House The principle of the Bill was discussed in the other House, and =iZe,ed upon the second reading. It was then Eent to a -Mcmmittee, and there, while the principles he had mentioned renmsixed unchanged, an alteration in the details was made, which increased the sum transferred to the Dock ,Trst in the shape of debt from 760,000h to nearly 3,000,CCOI. He had not had an opportunity of consuiting his colleagues of the committee, but such was the mtnaimniity which existed among them that he was certain In their absonce he could express their opinion as chairman. In point of strict equit7 he thought the arrangement proposed by the comrmiusonera satisied just demands; but, -considering the length of time the corporation of Liverpool bad es.joyed the advantage of managing the docks, and the psaritil recognition of it 'n the Municipal Act, the view was 3utifled that a larger um. than that awarded by the comanissioners sbould be transferred. This transfer, however, -could not be carried into eftect by the Bill sent up to the -other House, as the alteration involved a question of privilege. He was happy to say thatz after much litigation the -conflicting parties were now entrely agreed. It was of the last in,portance that a year should not be lost. The exist. -ng state of the works were inadequate to the growing trade -of the port. It was most desirable that on the Cheshire shore an extension of works should immediately take place. W-ithcut the concurrence of ParLuament in the proposal he dhould submit a most inexpedient delay would he rendered mooeseary. He was, theefore, strongly of opion that it would bo wise to introduce a newr Bill, giving effeot te the arrangemnent which had been settled by the Committee -f the House of Iords, and which was satisfaotory to all the es concerned, and antboriing tbo imsnediate prooseu. Isouofa* gres work whieb itl wras of the last importanoe chould not he postponed. He begged to move that a select cemnnittee bo appointed to inspect the Lords' journals r. ve to the Mersey Censervancy Bill,i and to make a rewrt thereon to the House. That report would be that the Bil was at an end, and at 6 'clock, upDonl the preaeata# of the report, he would move that a new Bill be introduced and passed thzough all its stages withoat delay. Mr. J. C. EWART seoonded the motion, which, after a few remarks from Mr. HEWsY, expressive of his conourrence in the proposed arrangement, was agreed to. The committee was constitated as follows:-Sir J. Graham, Air. Lowe, Mr. J. C. Ewart, Mr. Fitzroy, Mr. Henley, Sir W. Heathceote, Sir J. Y. Brller, and Mr. Adams. DIVORCE AND MATRIM&ONIAL CAUJSES BILL. The consideration of this BiU was resumed in committee On clause 28, relating to the dismissal of petitions, Mr. HENLEY said the committe would recollectthat in clause 25 there were five offences enumerated, any one of which it added to adultery would entitle a wife to apply for I divorce. Supposing, then, a woman to present a petition alleging adultery combined with bigamy, and the court to finnd that adultery had been committed but not bigamy, in tbat case, under clause 28, the court would not have power to dismiss the potition, while under clauze 29 it wouldunot have power to mnake a decree. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said clauses 27 and 23 had been introduced in order to detect collusion. They ilmposed a certain obligation upon the court in all cases, whether contested or uncontested. Supposing a,husband petitioned complaining of adultery, the court would, by clause 28, have imposed upon it the duty of ascertaiming that there had been no collusion or connivanee, that the husband had not been accessory to the gailt of his wife, and that there had been no condonation. The clause was directed specially to the crime of adultery, because there was no fear or danger of collusion in cases involving the ad. ditionsl grounds of divoree enumerated in olause 25. The clause pointed out the course which the court should adopt in cases where no respondent appeared, while the 29th clause increased the area in which the discretion of the court could be applied. Mr. HENLEY, in order formally to raise a discussion upon the point, moved to leave out the words "alleged adultery," and substitute "facts alleged." He perfectly understood that the intention of the clause was to govern the court in the dealing with uncontested cases, but it was necessary to look beyond those intentions, and to ascertaia what would be the effect of the words contained in the various clauses of the BilL It appeared to him that the new court would have no jurisdiction but the statutable one given by this Bil, and therefore, as one clause recited the causes for which the court should dismiss a petition while another defined the cases in which the court should make decrees, it would seem that these two clauses would control the acts of the court. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said, if any material facts were aUleged in a petitson and not proved to the satisfaotion of the court, it would be in the power of the court to dismiss the petition. The clause only defined what things the court should absolutely require to have proved in cases w here there was no respondent. He thought the clause as it stood was intelligible, and did not require ameusdnment.| Sir W. HEATalCOTE pointed out that in the case of a wife's petition, where the adultery complained of must be combined with some other offence, the latter might not be proved, but the court cosld not dismiiss the petition if the adultery wvere proved. He thought such a provision might tend to encourage collusive proceedings. Lord J. MANNllRS thought the point deserved further consideration. Mr. BUTT did not feel the difficulty experienced by the right hon. gentleman (Mr. EIenley), for there was an inherent power in any court to dismiss any case that nmight come before it. After a short conversation, Mr. IIuNnnY withdrew his amendment. Mr. BOVILL thought there would be great difficulty in making the commission of the adultery at any time during the marriage, without reference to the time or the fact of its condonation, a complete bar to divorce, and he therefore moved the onmission of the words, " or shall find that the husband has been guilty of adultery during the marriage." The ATTORNEY-GENERAL had no objection to the amendment. Mr. HENLEY preferred the clause as it stood. Mr. AYRTON said there had been cases in the Ecclesiastical Court where a condoned act of adultery on the part of the husband had not been held to be a bar to divorce. After some further conversation- thet-amendment was agreed to, and the words were omitted. Some vorbal amendments having been made in the clause, Mr. BUTT, in order to avoid collusive suits, moved the insertion of the words, " or that the petition has been presented or prosecuted in collusion with either of the other parties." The ATTORNEY-GENERAL offered no objection to the amendment, and it was agreed to. Mr. LNGRAM moved to insert at the end of the clause the words, " that the petitioner be not allowed to petition the court agaiu within five years." The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said, that as the Bill stood if a petition were dismissed it would not be competent for the petitioner to present it a second time. The amendment was then withdrawn and the clause agreed to. On clause 29, vwbich gave power to the court to pronounce a decree of divorce, Mr. ]BUTT moved the omission of the words, "or has committed adultery," in order to assimilate the clause to the preceding clause. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL supported the proposaL Mr. WALPOLE regretted that amendments were introduced in such a way that they could not receive proper consideration. For his own part, he believed that the act of adultery alone on the part of the petitioner ought to form a complete bar to a divoree being granted, and, therefore, he was opposed to the omission of the words. Lord j. MANNERS said that, with regard to the hurried consideration bestowed upon the Bill, the blame must rest with the Government, who called upon that House to sit at the end of Augnist from noon to midnight to consider a question of such vast importance. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL had no objection to the blame being laid upon the Governinent, butt he hoped that the committee would in future support him iu opposing amendments brought forward without notice. hMr. HENLEY said, that he objected to the omission of the words, as their omission would alter the whole of the existing law, which made adultery on the part of the petitioner a bar to a divorce. The hon. and learned gentle. man had spoken of venial adulterv, but itwould, he thought, be very difficult to find a definition of venial adultery, (A laugh.) The ATTORNEY-GENERAL was of opinion that it was absolutely necessary, after the alterations which had been introducrd in'n the preceding clause, that some change sbould be effected in that which was under discussion, If, therefore, the iun. and learned member for Youghal would withdraw his amenueutnt le sha uld move the omission from the clause after the word ' petitioner" of the words, " has committed adultery during tho marriage or," and the clause would then run thus:-* In casethe Court shall be satisfied upon the evidence that the case of the petitioner has been proved, and shall not find the petitioner in any manner accessory to the adultery complained of, &c." Mr. BUTT, aoting upon the suggestion of the AttorneyGeneral, withdrew his amendment. Mr. M'MAJON contended that if they were to pass the clause in the sbape which was proposed they would be violating all principle and making the decision, in the single case which had been cited by the hon. memuber for the Tower Hamlets, and which was quite an exceptional oase, the general rule. Sir G. GREY said, it was not proposed to lay down any general rule upon the subjeot, bat to give to the new court a discretionary power in dealing with exceptional cases such as that to which the hon. and learned member had alluded. Mr. MALINS was of opinion that it was desirable a disc-etionary power of that nature should be conferred. Mr. COLLINS, Mr. HENLEY, Lord J. MANNERS, and Mr. NEWNDEGATE expressed opinions against the omission of the words. Mr. WIGRAM thought that if the words were struck out a greater alteration would be made than the committee contemplated. Discretion would then he given in all cases of adultery committed by the husband. That was very different from giving discretion when the adultery had been condoned by the wife. (Hear.) The committee then divided, when the numbers wero- For the amendment ... ... ... 78 Against 37 Majority against. . . -41 The words were accordingly struck out. Mr. MONSELL then rose to move an amendment, the effect of which would be to raise the important question wvhetheror not the now court should have the power of granting divorce d vmclo, with power to the parties to re. marry agai Mr. WIGRAM rose to order. He beHieved that the principle had been settled in a previous clause. Mr. MONSELL stated that his only object had been to save the time of the committee. Sir W. IEATHCOTE then stated, on behalf of his right hon. coleague, that a the amendment which stood in his name referred to the amendment which he proposed to make in the 53d clause, he would not press it at present. Mr. WALPOLE then moved to add as a proviso the words "Provided always that the court shall not be at liberty to pronounce such decree where the petitioner shall be shown to have committed adultery which has not been endorsed." Such a proviso would maintain the existing principle of the law, which laid down that a person grflty of adultery, which, on the part of the husbahd, was the cause in nine cases out of ten of the fall of the wife, should not be able to obtain a divorce. The ATTORNEY-GENERA-L had no apprehension tha' a court of justice, in granting divorce 2 vis,culo upon the at3plication of eitber the husband or wife, would not, where there was a counter charge of adultery proved, hold that fact to be a bar to the divorce. The words proposed by the right hon. gentleman would apply only to naces of continuOUs adultery. Supposing the case of a young man married 2.5 years ago, who then, without the knowledge of it ever reaching his wife until nOW, had committed a single act of adultery, it would surely he very hard at such a distance of tinse to dig uLp that remote circumstance. He thought it would be better to leave the matter as it was The counrt -would be bound to act upon the general prinCple, but not to give effect to a single transgression such as he had mentioned. He would propose to insert in the clause the following words :-" If it shall be found thab the petitioner hu during marriage been guitty of adulter." Lord J. RUSSELL called the &t'antion of fie committoe to the faot that the Attorney-General had put a -ertioular ease as a reason for opposing the amendment. i Bill of this kind could not be framed vrithout isaving scme cas of pecultr hardship; but it appeared to him (Lord J. Rusell) that, if the proposal of the Attorney-General were agreed to, the law would be that, if the husband had gone on for five lear in a cours of open and contCnuous adultery, and in sbe sixth year the wife, misled by his bad example, should become forgetful of her marriage duties and also commit adultery, then the court would be at liberty to give a divorce at the suit of the husband, but not at the suit of the wife. Thehon. and learnedgentleman saidthe court would probably Dot act in tbat way; but they were framing an Act of Parliament on whioh the grounds of granting divorces were to be set out. He (Lord J. Russell) had been always apprehensive of enlarging very much the facilities for divorce; but this clause would enlarge them very much indeed in favour of the husbanid, while, at the same time, it was very restrictive in the case of the wife. It might be, that the new court for a few years would follow the practicn of the ecclesiastical court, but after a time the practice would change, and there would be nothing ia the Act to prevent the court from saying that it could not take into consideration aniy previous adultery on the part of the busband-tbat it was an unimoortant Circumstance, but that any adultery on the part of the wife should be aground for granting a divorce to the husband. Such a course would be an encouragement of profligacy, and would lead to a disruption of the proper conditions of married life most fearful to contemplate. He regretted that the Bill did not stand in tho same shape as it had come down from the House of Lords, and thought the best thing they could do was to agree to the proposal of the right hon. gentleman, (Hear, hear.) Mr. OLAY opposed the amendment, and believed that the case put by the Attorney-General was much stronger than that which had been supposed by the noble lord the member for London. Sir W. HEATHCOTE had always regarded with alarm the proposed increased discretion to be given to the new court, but his alarm had been much inoreased by a stateraent which had been made, that the amendments to the Bill sbould be so shaped as to give to the new court the same amount of discretion in granting divorces which the Legislature at pFesent of necessity arrogated to itself. Sir G. GREY said, the proposal of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Walpole) showed a mistrust of the court, as if it were not fit to be charged with any discretionary power. He would leave all such cases as had been raised by the right hon. gentleman and the noble lord the member for London to be inquired into by the court and decided upon according to their merits. Mr. HENLEY said, courts of justice went very tmuch by precedents. Indeed they were often the creatures and slaves of precedents, and there was, therefore, danger lest the perlod that might elapse after the adultery of the husband might be brought down step by step from nine years, for which there was a precedent, to one year. There might be come difficulty in limiting the case as proposed by his right hon. friend (Mr. Walpole), but there were still greater difficulties on the other side, and therefore he should divide with his right hon. friend. Mr. WIGRAM reminded the committee that no judicial separation could be given if there was uncondoned adultery on tbe part of the husband, and the same principle ought to be extended to cases of dissolution of marriage. Mr. AYRTON supported the clause as proposed by the Attorney-General. The court should be left to deal with all these questions as they arose. Mr. MALINS believed it would be Impossible to get three judges to grant a divorce in the circumstances stated by the noble lord the member for London-via, where a husband had been living in open adultery for a period of five years. lHe thus far agreed with his right hon. friend (Mr. Walpole) that where it was proved a husband had been guilty of adultery which the wife had not condoned divorce should not be given. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL opposed the amendment. Notorious profligacy on the part of the husband would, of course, be a bar to divorce; but it was absurd to say that one act of adultery, which had always remained unknown to the wife, and which had been atoned for by long years of repentance and fidelity, should act with equal force. Lord J. RUSSELL. said that in adopting the suggestion of the Attorney-General the committee would be sanctioning an alteration of the law of great importance, which would work for the husband against the wife, and would deprive her of a sort of security against the commission of adultery by the husband. It must be assumed that the House of Lords had shaped the clause in accordance with their present practice, and that if there had been adultery on the part of the man a divorce would be refused by them; but the suggestion of the Attorney-General if carried out, would leave the new court at liberty to exercise its discretion. .Mhfr. BUTTr thought that more harm would be done by allowing a condoned act of adultery on the part of the man to be a license to the woman for the rest of her life than by leaving it to the discretion of the court to determine whether the adultery of the man had been of such a character as to bar his divorce.i Mr. HENLEY supported the amendment. The committee divided. The numbers were,- For the amendment ... ... ... . .. 41 Against it ... ... ... 80 Majority . . Mr. BOVILL moved the insertion of words providing that the court should be allowed to dismiss a petition "where the petitioner shall have bsen guilty during the marriage of misconduct or neglect towards the other party to the marriage. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL suggested that instead of these words there should be added to the clause words limiting this ground of refusal of a divorceto "suchwiliul neglect or misconduct as has conduced to the adultery.' Mr. BOVIL, accepted this suggestion, and The amendment was withdrawn. Mr. BOVILL further moved the insertion of words pro. viding that the court should not be bound to pronounce a divorce "where the parties should have been living separate and apart from each other by consent before the adultery." This would only be to carry outthe existin law, because the House of Lords by a standing order refused divorces in all such cases. Mr. BUTT thought that the existing law would be better carired out by the insertion, instead of the words proposed by the hon. member for Guildford, of the words "or have deserted the other party, or have wilfully separated from the other party." Although by a standing order of the year 1798 the petitioner for a divorce might be examined at the bar of the House of Lords as to whether his wife was at the time the adultery was committed living with or apart from him, their lordships had granted divorces in several cases in which the parties had before the commission of the adultery been separated by deed. The ATTTORNEY-GENERAL suggested that the hon. and learned member for Guildford should withdraw his amendment in favour of that proposed by the hon. and learned member for YoughaL Mr. BOVILL withdrew his amendment, and the words proposed by Mr. Butt were inserted in the clause. The words previously suggested by Mr. Bovill, "such wilful neglect or misconduct as has conduced to the adultery," were then added to the clause. Mr. BOVILL proposed, in order to give the widest possible discretion to the court to refuse a divoree, to add the words, "or where the petitioner could not have heretofore obtained a divorce." Mr. WIGRA Nsuggested that the amendmient should ruA, "or under any other clrcumstances in which it shall appear to the court unfit or improper to grant a divorce." Mr. COX opposed the amendment, which was negatived without a division. On the question that the clause as amended stand part of the Bill, Mr. YiON SELL said he proposed to take a division upon the clause, which made marriage dissoluble for the first time to 99 out of every 100 families in the country. He called attentieos to the fact that the people had not had an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon the Bill, and said it was quite clear after the discussions which had takon place that even the members of that House themselves were at sea on the subject of marriageand divoece. They seemed to be unable to fix upon any principle which tbey could fairly and hogically carry out in the different limitations which they tllenselves had proposed to the Bill. Were they certain, he asked, that they were right when they were opposing what had been the law of this country for many years-what was admitted to have been the law of all Christendom for many centuries-and if they were wrong, had they calculated all the consequences that would follow? In Pruesiathere had been a constant addition to the grounds of divorce a vinculo, and the results had been frightful, holding out a warning to us which we ought not to despise or neglect. The result was that those persons who were most desirous of Improving the tone of morality In Prussia were anxious to revert bo that principle with reference to the dissolubility of the marriage tie, from which they had departed; while in the case of France it was notorious that its inhabitants bad found cause to repent the doctrines upon the sabject which had been legalized at the time of the revolution, and bad, therefore, in 1816, deemed it advisable to return to their ancient law of marriage, by that means saving themselves from those unhappy consequences which might be anticipated to follow in this country the pasing of the Bill under the consideration of the committee. As it was near the hour (10 minutes to 4) when further disoussion on this Bill must for a time be suspanded, he should offer no further observations in opDosition to the clause, but should content himself with moving that it be omitted from the BilL The committee thean divided. The numbers were:- Ayes . 8 Noes .. . ... ... ... .. 21 Majority for the clause . - 7 The olause was then agreed to. CONSOLIDATION FUND APPROPRIATION BL1C This Bil was read a third time and passed, as were also the Probate and Letters of Administration (Ireland) Bill, and the Jurisdiction in Siam Bill. Mr. PULMAN, deputy-usher of the black rod, then appeared at the bar end summoned the House to attend the House of Lords to hear the toyal assent given by com- mission to several Bills. The SPEARER, accompanied by some bon. members, left the House in obedience to the summons, and 4 o'clock having arrived, the sitting of the House was suspended. The House resumed business at 6 o'clock. PETITIONS. Petitions were presented by Lord PNvxscs, from Battle, in Sassex, agaist the Compulsory Vaccination Actby Mr. BUTniR, from Clapton, Hackney, and Dalston, lhiddleeex, praying the House to pas a measure to confine Sunday trading to the sale of such articles as are absolutely required for public convenience; by Mr. NICOLL,, in favour of the Divoroo Bill, signed by Humphrey Obarles Harrold, of Frome, Somers6tshire, sta'eing that the petiticner'a wife left his home without just cause, and is now living in open adultery with her sodocer, and praying the House to estab1bsh an economioal means of divorce b;y Mr. Jonse Looscz, fromworking men and other inhabitants of London, in favour of opening museums, &o., on Sunday afternoons; by Mr. BOUVERIE, from Paisley, in favour of the (Sootland) Smoke Bill; from Antrter Easter, against the Police Bll and the Luatic Bill; and from Orail, against the Police Bill and the Lunatic Bill * by Mr. H. J. B. C B from the merchants and shipowners of Plymouth, for modifica tion of the Mrchaft Shipping Act ot 1864; also froen I medical officers of Kingston (Surray) Union, for redress of grievnces. MERSEY CONSEIYVAICY BLL. Sir J. GRAEHAX said that since he addressed tho House that morning he had been informed.that a petition woald be presented by the dock trustees upon some of the clausws in tho proposed news Bill. Under these eiroamstances the coarse he should take was to move for leave to bring in the Bill and to suspend tbe standing orders so far as to allow it to be read a first aud seeond time this evening. The Committee of Selection might nominate a committee to-morrow, aud that committee might sit on Wednesday to hear the case of the party petitioning to be heard. He was sorryto say it would not be in his power to take Dart in ulterior proceedings, bht if unhappily the arrangement which was in the nature of a Comupromise, should not be carried into effect by legislation thissess8ion, he shonld treat the qnestion as entirely open for further onasideration. He would ask tho Speaker whether he saw any insuperable objection to the course which he proposed to take ? Mr. J. EWART entertained hopes that the clauses would be settled to-morrow. Mr. HENLEY could understand the suspension of standing orders to allow an arrangement made in the House of Lords to be carried out ; but if any parties wanted to be heard the question assumed a difforent shape, and he woald suggest that the righthon. boronet might take the course he proposed, with the understanding that the Bill should go no further if there were any petition. The SPEAKER, ia reply ta the appeal ofthe right hon. baronet, said it was a question for the House to decide rather than for him to give any decision but, for himself he thought there coald beano objection to the course proposed by the right. baronet,-namely, that the Bill should be brought in, read a first and second time, and then referred to a committee appointed by the Committee of Selection. The party claiming to be heard would ia that case have a hearmg, and it would then be for the committee to dcide what was the nature of the objection, and whether there was any serious difflcllty to the Bil making further progress. After the decision to which the House had come in the morning, the magnitude of the case seemeedto be such as cald for the suspension of the ordinary rales of the House. (Hear.) e Mr. GILP N thought no other state of the case than that of aU parties being agread could justify the Eoase in doparting from its usaal course, and was afraid that a contrary proceeding might form a very inconvenieat precedent. Sir W. HEATTaOTE did not see any objeetion to the introductioa of the Bill and the first and second reading but if a petition arose, and it became an opposed Bill, thG House shou:ld consider, very, maturely, ^ before it ran the risk of doing injustice by rapid proceedings. SirE J. GREAH Ar, having thanked the Speaker for his opinion, moved for leave to bring in the Bill, to suspend standing orders, so as to read it a first. and second time, and to refer it to the Committee of Selection. Mr. FITZROY hoped the Bill would not be allowed to proceed if a bondfide oppositlon should arise. He would not give a decided Opinlon, but he thought there was no pre edent for suspaning standing orders in the case of an opposed BUL The House could not prejudice the interests of any party by reading the BiU a second time; but if the dock committee were prepared to introduce amendments they ought to be allowed an opportunity of making their statements. He thereforo hoped that means would be taken to register the opinion of the ouse, that in the event of a bondide opposition the Bill should not be pressed beyond the second reading. Mr. gJ. C. EWART said, the dock committee did not oppose the principle of the Bil, but were anxious to be heard on some of the clauses, The BiU was thea introduced and read the first time. Sir J. GRA.HA Of, in moving the second reading of the Bill, said the safest course would be to read the Bill a second time, and then refer it to a select committee. He hoped that the parties before that committee would oome to an amicable arrangement - but if no such arrangement should be made, and the schelale of the Bil should be altered, he thought justice requirod that aU the parties who had been beard before, and who might dissent from the proposed alteration, should have an opportunity of making their statements. At this period of the sesion that would be impossible, and therefore the BiUl ought not to be proceeded with further. Mr. HENLEY doubted whether any alteration ought to be allowed to be made in the BilL He was ready to get rid of a technical difficulty arising from theforms of the House, in order to carry out an arrangement known to both Houses of Parliament; bnt if alterations were to be made in the BiU before the select committee they might be quite contrary to the decision of the House of Lords. To send the Bill before a committee with the view of having any of its clauses changed or modified would be to establish a very inconvenient precedent, and therefore he hoped the Bill would not be altered in any particular. Mr. L&BOUCHERE admitted the great importance of settling the long-disputed question which had arisen in regard to the conservancy of the Mersey in the present sea sion; ubt, on the other hand, it wAs of the utmost consequence that they should not depart from their usual mode of conducting private business. If the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle, whose great experience in the basiness of that House, both public and private, and whose thorough acquaintance with the subject of this Bill all must acknowledge, could attend the meetings of the select committee, they would then have an assurance that their intentions would be properly carr ed into effect; but, unfortanately, the right hon. baronethad stated that he was obUged to leave town, and therofore the House would not have the advantage of his services. For his own part, he was desirous that no technical difficulty should be thrown in the way of a satisfactory settlement of this question, bat he thought that no substantial alteration should be allowed to be made in tbe Bill without the fuU cognizance of both Houses. Mr. DISRAELI said that the probable absence of the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle was not the only ciroumstance which ought to be taken into account. The hon. member for Liverpool had intimated that a portion of his constituents wished to be heard by couusel on some of the clauses. Perhaps the hon. gentleman wonld state to the House whether he had the consent of his colleague to the proposed arrangement, aud also give an assurance that if the House agreed to the second reading the Bill would go before the committee as an unopposed Bill, and no attempt would be made to introduce amendments. Mr. J. C. EWABRT stated that the opinion of his colleague was quite in accordance with his own. He had not said that counsel were to be heard, but merely that the dock committee wished to state to the select committee some objections which they entertained to two or three of the clauses. Sir J. GRAHAM said. he had engagements at a distance from London to-morrow which he could not pcstpone, and he was afraid, therefore, it would be quite impossible for him to take any part in the further progress of this meaEure. He had come to the conclusion, after what had been said,that, upon the whole, the safest course would be to let the Bill go before the select committee as a untopposed Bill. The House had gone very far in marking its desire not to obstruct the progress of the measure. If the parties could not come to au arrangement he was afraid the further progress of the Bill, with a due regard to the interests of those concerned, must be arrestd. (Hear, hear.) The responsibility of so arrestinz it would devolve upon those who had been heard fully before two committees, and who were yet dissatisfied with the result: and he hoped the House would let ibtbe understood that in a future session this question would be regarded as entirely open, and the arrangement now snegested as of no force whatever. In the meartime he woulld rest satisfied with having moved the secoa d reading, and would not proceed to move that the Bill be referred to a select comcaittee, hoping that it would be allowed to go forward as an unopposed Bill. Mxr.FITZROYremindedtherighthon. baronet thatthe course he proposed was impossible, because as soon as the Bill had been read a second time a petItion would bo lodged against it, thas bringing it under the category of opposed Bills. As soon as any petition was presented the BiU became at once an opposed BilL Sir J. GRAHAM said that no petition had been presented, nor did he believe that any would be presented. If the Bill were opposed it must be lost, and the responsibiliuy for that would rest upon the opponents of the BilL Sir W. HEATHOOTE suggested that some precautions should be taken to limit the time fied for presenting pcetitions. The Bill waS then read a second time. Sir J. GRAHAM then moved that Wednesday next, at 2 o'clock, be the latest period for receiving petitions against the Bill Mr. FITZROY thought that was a fair arrangement. He sbould move that the Bi be referred to the Committee of Selection to appoint a committee to consider it, and that the committee should meet on Wednesday next, at 3 o'clock. Mr. HENLEY remarked that he believed the mombcers of the Committee of Select.on had aU disappeared. (Alangh). If so, it would be difficulk to get a committee appointed. Mr. LOWE did not think the point was material If the same parties chose to oppose the BiUl upon this occasion theymnisat understand that they had not the slightest chance of carrying their points, although they might succeed in defeating the BilL UJnder existing circumstances, these gentlemen would have no canceewhatever of oarrz in their points before this or any other committee, and if the Bill wan lost the responsibility lrested with them. The motion for reforrng the Bill to the Committee of Selection was then agreed to. P1UBLIC HEALTH ACT. Mr. CONINGHAM rose to ask the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education whether Mr, F. 0. Ward had been correctly reported to have said at the International Congress at Brussels in September last that the application of the Public Health Act to 200 towns in England had diminished the mortality by 50 per cent., and had in their vicinity quadrupled the fertility of the soiL M-. COWPBR said that Mr. Ward was not officialy connected with the Board of Health, bat, as he had with eat zeal and ability supported the sanitary measures which h saved the lives of many thousands of our fellowcountrymen, he had shared in some of the misrepresentation which had 'been lavished upon the Board of Health. Mr. Ward's remarks at Brussels having been made in his hearig, he could say that the misrepresentations to which Mr. Ward had been exposed had arisen from a partial and unfair quotation of the statement, he had made. Mr. Ward did not allude to the mortality throughout the entire country, nor to that arising from all causes, but to the mortality observable in the most wretched parts of certain towns, and in those districts where the air was impure and the watcr poUlted. Mr. Ward's statements were borne out by thex erienc of Croydon, Leicester, Rugby, and other towns. Wtibt regard to the statement relative to theincreased fertility of the soil, Mr. Ward was only speaking of the fertility arsngfrem sewagelrrlgatioa, and whenbesaid that the fertility of the soil lod been quadropled by this means he reFerred to what had taken place in the neighbour.. hood of Edinburgh *and Apr. THE INDIAN BUDGET. Lord 0. HAMILTON wished to know whether it wa the intention of the President of the Board of Control to make the nsual annual statement on Indian finance, and, if so, on what day. Mr. V. SMiTH said that the practice of makmng an annual statement upon Indian finance had arisen from a desire on the part of the House to direot its attention durin one day in the session to the state of affairs in India, und the wish to hear the President of the Board of Contibol explain the prospective estimate of Indian revenue andexpenditure. During the present session the unfortunate events that had occurred in India had awakened the attention of Parliament, aud upon two or three occasions the House had been oceupied in discusging the affairs of India. Owing also to the confusion that bad taken place in the north- westera provinces any estimate of Indian finance prepared before the recent mutSmy must of course be perfectly fallacious. Under these ircumstances, and considering the lateness of the session, and the unlikelihood that members would remain in town to hear any statement he could make year the G overn en had deDd tet CrOm s e in u0t to b rin g forw ard this year he uual tatemnt uon Idia.(Bea.r.)

Mr. H.DR REPERT could not say that it was the intdention of the Government to make aa immediate appointment, as there was no acknowleged vacncy in the office to whioh the hon. gentleman had alluded. A statement had, however, been made to the Government that Mr. Greea was unable to attend to his magisterial duties. If this inability heemed likely to be permuasnent the Government would ol prepared to take steps to remedy the inconvenienre. THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS IlN INDIA. Mr. DISRAELI wished to know whether the President of the Board of Control would be prepared to lay upon the table the Act recently pased by the Legisative Council of India (No. 1i of the year 18ns whestrasng the liberty of the press in the dominions of the st India Comptny. tor. V. SGvoTH.-There is not the least objection to lay It upon the table. The right hon. gentleman is aware that it was only passed for one year. Mr. DISRAELI would be glad to have two other documents-one acopy of the despatch of the Governor-General, explaining the reasons why the Act for restraining the liberty of the press was extended to the loyal E.roen portion of the inhabitants of India as well as to the natives, and also a copy of tha memori and remonstrance addressed to the Governor-General by the European population. If the right hon. gentleman did not object to the production of these documents he would put a notice upon the paper and move for them to-morrow as unopposed returns. Mr. V. SMITE had no objection to lay upon the table a copy of the despatch of the Governor-Gwsoeneral. He was not quite certain as to the memoriae, but he would see whether it could be also produced. M[r. AYRTON1 inquired whether a copy of the article for ahich the first waning was given to the Ft-lend of India could be laid upoin the table. -Mr. V.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONAL CAUSES BILL. The House went into committee on this BilL On clause 30, Mr. HENLEY wished to know whether alimony to the wife could not be granted in certain cases while her sait was pending. Lord LOVAINE moved, in the first line of clause 30, to substitute the word "shall" for the words "may, if it shall think fit," the effect of which would be to render it obligatory instead of discretionary in the new court, on pronouncing a deoree dissolving a marriage at the instanco of the wife, to make it a condition that the husband should secure the payment of alimony to her, either in a gross sum or an annual one. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought the power to graut alimony had better be the disoretionary in the Court, as the clause as it now stood providced it should be, for otherwise it might operate very inconveniently in many cases where the wiEe might not be entitled to sach consider. ation from the court. Ie would say, in reply to the right hon. gentleman (hfr. Henley), that it was undoubtedly true that the Bill as at present worded vould not, in a suit for a dissolution of marriage, throw on the court the obligation of adopting the practice of the eelesiastical courts. In a suit for judicial separation the practie of the ecclesiastical courts might possibly be adopted by the new court; bat it vas a matter for grave consideration whether that practice, which wee extremely anomalous, wa or was not a desirable thing to maintain. le thought where a wife applied for a divorcev aincuto it would be desirable to leave the court unfettered, because otherwise there might be, as at present, many CaSes where the wife might fall into the hands of an extortionato legal adviser, who would subject the husband to a grievous amount of expense. Mr. HENLEY reminded the Attorney-General that according to clause 16 the committee had already decided in effect that the court should be guided by the rules and principles of the ecclesiastical courts; and he thought it was not asking too mu,h that in a suit for dissolution of marriage the wife should not be left wichout reasonable means of carrying on that suit, which might otherwise be denied her by a profligate huaband. The ATTO RltNEY.GENERAL said, it was a common law liability on the husband to maintain the wife; but it was a rule peculiar to the ecclesiastical courts to make him liable to assist her in carrying on a legal proceeding against him. He should, however, take the point suggested by the right hon. gentleman into consideration, and endeavour to provide for it. Lord LOVAINE thought some consideration should be given to the fact that the wife might be abandoned by the husband and left without any resources at all, even in cases where she had broaght him a fortune on their marriage. After a short conversation, in which Mr. MALOIS, Lord J. MAN?vERs, and Mr. BuTr took part, The amendment was negatived. 3Mr. BUTT said, the clause provided that " the court may, if it shall think fit, make it a condition that the husband" should secure alimony to the wife. He thought these words would be inadequate to insure a provision for the wlfe, and he would propose the substitution of the words " absolutely order" for the words "make it a condition." After a short conrersation, The ATTORNEY.GENERAL, who had suggested the adoption of the word "- require," agreed to substitute the word "order" for the words "make it a condition." Some verbal alterations consequent upon this amendment having been made the clause was agreed to. On clause 31, which gives the court power to impose a fine upon the adulterer, Mr. PULLIER said, he had given notice of his intention to move that instead of the words "whenever in any suah petition presented by a husband the alleged adulterer shall have been made a co-respondent and the adultary shall have been established," the words "whenever in any snoh petition presented for the dissolution of a marriage, or for a decree of judicial separation on the ground of adultery" be inserted in the clause. It would be necessary, as a preliminary amendment, that he should move the substitution of the word " on" for the word " in." Up to the present time adultery had not been treated as a crime by the law of this country, bat had been dealt with as a sin by the ecclesiastical courts. This clause, however, proposed to give the court the power of imposing a fine upon the adulterer, and also of ordering him to pay the whole or any part of the costs of the proceedings. It appeared to him that this was a most inadequate mode of dealing with adultery. The Bill did not caU adultery a crime or a misdemeanour, and he thought that was quite right, because, if adultery had been so described in the Bill, offenders might have been indicted by discarded servants, or by utter strangers, without the consent of the injured husband or wife. Sabstantially, however, adultery was constituted a crime by the Bill, and it was for the committee to determine whether the mere imposition of a fine upon the adulterer was a satisfactory fisde of treating such a crime. With the view of giving the commuttee an opportanity of expresing their opinion upon that point he intended subsequently to move the insertion of words which would enable the oourt to order the respondent, and also the co-zespondent, if any, to be punished by fine or ihprisonment, or by fine and imprisonmnt, as if convicted of a misdemeanour." Having stated reasons last Friday why this change should be made, he would not nov repeat them, but would move his first amendment in line 20 to insert the word "on" instead The ATTORNEY.GENERAJL said, that the clause, besides the question raised by the hon. member for Hertfordshire, involved - another very important consideration, whother in these proceedings it should be competent for the court to impose on the adulterer any peouniary penalty to bo applied for the benefit of the husband or of the children, or as provision for the unfortunate wife. The present amuendment proposed by the hon. member for Hertfordshire involved the question, if question it ought now to be considered, whether :.dultery should be criminally punished. He did not mean to go into the question at any length, because he believed that all persons who had directed their attention to the subject combined in condemsition of the principle of making adultery criminaly punishable, and history sbowed that that principle, when attempted to be put in practice, had signally failed. On the ocasion of different divorce Bills pY?sing the Legislature the principle had more or leIs been brought under discussion, and thero were solemn debates, which took place in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons on the subject, and which were recrted in the Parliamentary Journals. They occurred, he blieved, in 1781, in 1800, aud again in 1801; and it was there laid down that it would not tend to advance the intereets of morality, and that it was not required by tho principles of criminal legislation, but rather overstepped the limibs of eriminal juridiction, to attempt to treat adultery as a erime punishable as an offence egant the State. lledidnot intend to detain the com- n.ittoe by a reEetition of the argumeats drawn fron. thca. sources, oLhere every arguinent which could be lroit to bear on the subject was urged, beeaeae, b- elevod.thathet distinction between what rut be prevented bya reightius and moral education, and what prmperlyt benged toobie eiws of offended societ ogodlt m to to, d mr tomaketbeadutvrto*punisT in muotne ov6t oohe ap-fr one wo had considerted the queieon. nou tro tdii that the comsbmittee would adheie to that Which on every Oamendmon was rehognized as the trtu rin, ,c e tha it asiot by any law, ymaing an oft p tom like adulieyih a.Crime, that it rould be reprassed, for it 'w not bi of ofeans that people could he made moreI a ew ions or m6rL HLshould thereforeopposethpou e amet th e t w6twnold no doubt beobserved that the Bill, as brought down froti:teo House ofLords, 'id em todyineayliited- torthe prinob 4le of criminal punisbment by the imposition r of afie.

Lord 3. MA NNERS thou&ht that the tetimoniy of history was rather against than in f0our tf the view tak en by the hon, and learned Attorney-GederaL hhe noblte lbrd here mentioned several nations from the records of which it appeared that adultery had been punisbhd as a social cf to Andwhat, he anked, 'was the saote r of the elawin Fraftie?

But, even if the hon. and learned gentleman oeon, ntedto rethin that provision, be contendedl that without some ;oh amendment as the one under discusson the tendency ofithe Bill wonld be to encourage. and not to doeioure the adulterer and adulteress. Itwassaid th aetuntilli ti of the Commonwealth there was no ides pf marg this grpat crime a subject of junishment. Now, on other omcaigna they had heard a'giat deal about the Befomsi Lss and the opinions of dreamer and his Associates on the eib ject of divore.

With regard to the T cuniary libe imposed by, this Bill, it was quite clear that the wealthy seduer of his neighbour's wife, if he only paid the money, might mar or dicanrd the 'womn as hu e chose, and then nothing more would be said about it; whil the poor man would be sent to prison, not because he had commith a a hea offence, but lie6ause he had not the money wherewith to ndonei. (Hear, hear.) They were told thatt tbi atell to ptl the poor and the rich on an equalityhe bt 'where w equality ini this case aIt appeauedtohim a mere mockery of justlce to imprison the poor MaynWhile the rich adulterer e yaped on fdyment of a fine. The c6m' mittee should remember that Lord Lyndhurst bud other high authorities declared that adultery ought to be regarded as a crime, and to he punished as such. Cduld any offence be( cprceivedi which struck inore at the peace of famUiies and at the welfare of sooiety? Aud& he augnred the worst sootrb consequences from a system of law which rimould teach the rich that the payment of a sum of maoney, not larger perhaps than the fee payable for taking out a patent, would allow them to commit this offence'with p eet impunitg so far as the law was concerned. (vFler, hear.) If the committee desired to discourage the commiwn sion of adultery in tais country he entreated thedu to-sup- rt the amendiment f f the hon. maember for lertfordshire. (r.l Poller.) Mr. BUTV said tha~t nothing would be more objectiozable or uinprecedented in English law than to allow a man to be convicted and punished for a criminal offence upon a civil guit. (Hear, hear,) s This would be a mongrel kisne of proceeding, the only effect of which he believed woald be to introduce endless cqnfasion. Did the hon. and le)ined gentleman ean that inas was quite possible, the atf adultery was committed I gnorance, the party ahotal}bo visited 'with imprioonment, though indsuceh pase he nmight be civvllyn liable, and the sentenc of divbrce would follow? So machl wasfhe (Mr. Butt) oppped told a oee of this kind that he evcia in- tend) epdiatgred teing azn dltrncie u thenae ts obtcct to the words imposing a fine onethe adulterer. Itwasrid that ifinoe was a substitutef ithe action for criminal proceedings. He mnust say, however, that he thought it a 'very inefficient subetitute. The 'fine imposed was only given to the peron who possessd'the leans of instituting rnoceedins forta aivoroe in this Igh court, 'while the Bill a9lihed an action which might have its faults and itste£alas (thoughthese, he believed, hadheen exaggerated), but whinch certainly had been and now was the means of protot inthe poorman. If,however, adulterywas a bigh criminal offence, he objected to their deciding'mhat question at al upon a claume of this sort. Then again wvv the possibility of punishment to depend upon the aciddent of proceedings being taken in a civil court? It would e tpro. ductive f ad effects! if a shield, so to speak, were thrown around the adulterer, and he could only be puished'prot vided a suit for divorce were instituted. He contended tofat if adultery was a criominal offence it ought to be deat with by the proper crimplal tribunals of the country, notla y a civcl court, and such a question would hset be raised by the introduction of a distinct clause containing a provnisn of that kind. (Rlear.) Mr. M'IAHON said, inamuch as the Bi 'would pa t an enD to actions of crim. con., it would almost induce parties to commit adultry, unless adultery 'were rade a ne sdeT meanour. It 'was not certain whether by the existin't law adultery was not a criminal offence The committbe had been told by the Attorney-General that the LUegislatile ian 1800 repudiated the idea of making adulthry a crime, but the fast was that thd Bil to 'which the Attorney-General alluded pnaned through the House of Lords and was-lot ia the House of Comamons, merely benuse it contahie a clause prohibiting the gauity parties from marrying It would seem from the firt volume of the St ate Tr that adultery was an indictable offenec. Mr. WIGRAM t iegesed to the hon. member for Hertfordshire that a division merely upon the question whether "mon" should be subtitutedfor "in" would not acconqplisto his obect, and that b e had better 'withdraw Ids amen4rsent, with the biew of taking a division upon an Inendhent to the effect that imprisonment should be inflicted for adcltery. the, PULLER would be glad to adopt ay course liky to effect his object, Mr. HENLEY wEls afraid th-at the mrsstitutjon of on" for "in" would not enible the committee rid of the difficulties connected with the clause. The Attl reyGeneral had completely thrown over the whole clauie, at wrhich he was not sulprised.

LONDON, TUESDAY, AUGUSr 18, 1857. The House of Lords sat only for a short time last tdght, The Royal assent was given to a great numlber of Bills, and in certain cases ia which the Commons had made amendments their Lordships determined to accept them. On Ahe Dulwich College B4l, however, they determined to " disagree" upon the amendments for constitatIng the governing body of the College. Tho Scotch Lunatics Bill was passed, and several Dther Bills were forwarded a stage; and the Appropriation Bill-that sure forerunner of the proroga-tion-.was read a first tine. Their Lordships then adjourned. The llouse of Commons,atthe early sitting, went again into committee upon the Divorce and Matrianonial Causes Bill, commencing with the 28sh -clause, authorizing and requiring the Conrt in certain cases to dismi8s a petition for divorce. Various alterations were proposed in this clause tall without notice given), some of which were Bdopted 7)y the Government and assented to, in one tather imuportant instance, apparently, without Eomo members of the committse being avware of the effect of the change. The succeeding clause, authorizing and requiring bie Court, under certain conditions, to pronounce a dercee of dissolution, was likewise materially Inodified. Mr. N ALPoLE proposed to include in the proviso to this cla3se, " that the Court shall not be at liberty to pronounce a decree of dissolution where Zhe petitioner should have been guilty of adultery anot condoned ," but this amendment was negatived aupon a division. The ATrorxiNY-GENERAL moved to include in the jroviso " that the Court shall not be bound to pronounce such decree if it shall find that the petitioner lhad during the marriage been guilty of adultery." This emendment was agreed to, aswell as another -elso proposed by the AmroaiEY-GzsaNAi, including amnong the exceptions in the proviso wilful separa-ion before the adultery without reasonable excuse, -and wilful neglect or miscondact which shall have tonduced to the adultery. The clause, thus amended, was opposed by Mr. WoNsEnLL, because it authorized divorce a vinculo; Jut it was carried by 88 to 21. With this division the sitting terminated, two .Olauses only having been passed. The Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill, the P'robates and Letters of Administration (Ireland) 'Bill, and the Jurisdiction in Siam Bill were read a third tine and passed. In the evening, in reply to an inquiry by Lord .D. HALMILTON, Mr. V. Sani ad that, under existing circumttances, the Government had decided not to bring forward the usual annual xtatement on the Tndian Anancee. In reply to Mr. Kn=NA, Mr. LASOUBc P stated that it was intended to vrobibit in 'uture any priest or other minister of religion from being elected a member of the Legis-lative Co'lcil of Mklta. The House returned into Conmmittee upon the ;3)Ivorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill. The 31st clause empowers the Court, where the ;dultery has been established, on the petition of She husband, to impose a fine upon the adulterer, hie having been made a co-respondent, and to order Aim to pay the costs. Mr. euLLFF proposed to amend this clause by 4bmpowering the Court to punish the respondent and co-respondent by fine, or imprisonment, or both, as if convicted of a misdemeanour. The ATToIEy-GSNEAL objected to making adultery a criminal offence. After a long discuseion the clause was agreed to, vrith the omission of the words authorzing the imposition -of a fine upon the adulterer, which the AToTRNYan-GxEnsRA proposed to make the subjed of another clause. In the 52d clause, which. sanctions an appslm to the Hoase of Lords, the limitation of the appeal to questions of law was expunged. The next clause, enabling parties to a marriage dissolved under the Act to marry again, as if the prior marriage had been dissolved by death, gave occasion to many notices of amendments. Mr. ROLT who had given notice of one to disable the party by whose adultery or other offence the marriage shall have been dissolved from marrying again, moved, however, in the first instance, an amendment, of which notice hadbeen given by Mr. NArn, to restrict the permission to remarry to the party on whose petition the marriage shall have been diasolved. Sir G. GXRY resisted the latter proposition, and a foHtiori the former. Upon a division, Mr. NArmn's amendment was negatived by 110 to 50, and this vote virtually decided the fate of Mr. Rom's. The Chairman was then ordered to report progress. The Trustees Relief Bill was withdrawn. The Judgments Bill was committed pro fornul. On the order for going into committee upon the Crowded Dwellings Prevention BiR, Mr. RIDnxY moved to defer the committee for three months. After some discussion the House divided, when the amendment was negatived by 44 to 23. The House then went into committee, but the Chairman immediately reported progress. The House adjourned at 2 o'clock.
After reading of the gallant deaths of some halfdozen officers " of the late 54th," or " of the late 20th," or " of the late 3d," but then " attached "to the Ghoorkas," or to some other Irregular or European force, and apparently throwing themselves into the post of dauger before the walls of Delhi, it may seem hardly the time to comment on the defective relations of such men with the native soldier. It is not, however, the men, but the system, which is in question,the system in which they found themselves placed from the day they joined their regiments, and from which they could not extricate themselves. That system has the condernation of almost every good soldier who came in contact with it, and has the still deeper condemnation of being absolutely without an example in its favour in any country, in ancient or modern times. It may be described as an attempt to commanud a native army by means of a hybrid class, half soldier, half civilian, but wanting just that soldiership that was necessary to bind them together with their men. In all respects, in their numerical proportion to the rank and file, in their studies, in their objects of ambition, and in their manners of life, they have been rather staff than regimental officers, and rather a governing class distriouted over the army and maintained by it than themselvas professional soldiers, for the regimental officer who, in HRf MAaxTYs's service, is so proud of his relations with his men has no existence in India, except ia the form of the native officer, and he must remain content with that pride, for he is forbidden any other. Thus the British officers of the Native Indian Army may be brave and able men, as, indeed, they undoubtedly are. They may be better politicians, and more versed in the science of war, than the gentlemen holding HEE MAJEsry's commission ; but one thing they want, which is now found to be also required. They have no hold on their men, beyond the regard which the latter wiil always have for kindness and a dignified bearing. They have no communication, no confidence, with their men. They may remain for months fearfully ignorant of disaffection and conspiracy, extending to an actual organization, pervading a whole army. No doubt, the difference of race, language, and religion would make this more possible; but that was a reason why the system should be adapted to bring the British officer into closer relations with the Sepoy_. Nowr, this is the very system to which the armies of great empires have ever been liable, and against which the true soldier has always protested. No scholar could read the extracts from a letter of Sir a. NAPmR in our yesterday's columns without being reminded of the old Roman's continual lamentation over the decline of military virtue. WVhen Rome had conquered, and had thenceforth to govern the world, there arose a new class of candidates for military honours. These were men who cared little for the old rugged type of the soldier, or for the personal attachment of mercenaries and barbarians, but -who wanted governorships aud other lucrative civil offices, patronage, and plunder,-the means of present enjoyment and of future elevation. No doubt, the soldier has always appreciated these things, like the rest of mankind, but when the period of war seems to be over, and armies are maintained as the guardians and ornaments of peace, then a purely military ambition inevitably yields to one of a more mixed character, and a different class of qualities carries the day. On an emergency we send for a NAPrER, a COLo CA3MPBELL, a WENDnA, aVAN OoAmsnT , or any real soldier; but when we do not expect war, but diplomacy, treaties, governments, and peace, then we naturally incline to the men who excel in the old field open to them, at the desk, at the club, or the hospitable board. We give our patronage to the sons of good men or of political friends, and the army becomes officered by the same class as the various departments of the civil service. There is much to neutralize the selection of such men in the Qu=N's service, but -when in ordinary times a young English gentleman, with no great military ardour, and not much ambition beyond the wish to enjoy himself and make his fortune, joins his regiment in India, he finds nothing to wake the dormant soldier within him. He finds a fine regiment, the drill and discipline of which are entirely in the hands of native officers, and, as regards appearance, of a high order. He finds that interference would be as disagreeable to all parties as it seems to be innecessary, and nothing remains for him but to pass his time as pleasantly as he can with his fellow-officers. Hence the babits of indolence and self-indulgence of which Sir a. NAPmR, in common with other soldiers of the severe old class, complains so bitterly, and which he says at once disable the officer and lovrer him in the respect of the native. The apology of the system is, that this is an affair of empire, and headworic is that which is wanted. Certainly, if we couald be secure against war, then we might pult any clever man in command of a regiment, to do the duties of a policeman, a tax-collector, or a gaoler; and when he had shown himslf superior to those employments we might promote him to a governorship, an embassy, or any political post. But this simple " headwork" is as much the bane of modern armies as mere physical strength was of those of our ancestors. A clever man and a giant may be equallydestitute of true soldierly qualities,-equaly without heroism, without the power of attaching and insDiring followers, without enthusiaam,without military virtue or skill. In almost every descriotion of a great General, in all times, it has been expressly stated that he possessed the strongest sympathy with his zoldiers; and it has been added sometimes, either that he knew an incr-dible number by name, or that he was wont to march on foot with them, and to learn from their own lips what they wanted. Such particulars may be more proper to one age than, to another, and may even be poetical exaggerations; but they point to, close relation and comLaninxship between the- officer and the soldier. as necessary to the effaincy -of armaies. If .lnrelai4n be impossible in our Indian armies, then it is also impossible to prevent the recurrence of periodical and frequent mutiny. A want of due sympathy between the officer and theprivate, when that wautis aggravated by the circumistance that the one is the conqueror and the other the conquered, is sure to lead to a rupture in the worst posAible way. At home, 'where there is a certain degree of Wympathy between all classes, and at least a sense of political justice, no army could go on long without discharging its pecuniary obligations. In India Sir a. NEr:RB alludes to the melancholy fact of thousands of Indian husbandmen and labourers being kept for years out of their scanty pay for forced services rendered to our army, and cattle and carts lost upon the march. This he ascribes to the complications and delays of the system, which he says everywhere lead to the greatest actual cruelty. Such a system implies the absence of common sympathy-the first element of a good soldier-and it helps to account for the prcsent disaster. As soon as we have recovered from this storm it will devolve upon those who have the power to take immediate steps for uniting into one whole the discordant elements of the Indian regiment. It is, of course, desirable to increase the number of the British officers, and in many regiments that must be done even to reach the average; but, whether this be. done or not, the officer must be put more in communication with the [men, no longer taken from them the instant he has learnt their language or won their confidence, and not put into a disadvantageous position by adhering to his regimental duties.
Our correspondent from China in yesterday's paper asks, " Why is it that we are so far "from home? Why have we 9,000 miles "between England and her Eastern dominions "untraversed by a telegraph ?" Lord PA.- sixSTON forestalled on Friday night this cry. from the Antipodes. We are to have at last an Indian Telegraph. After the Pun% !'s remarks in the House on Friday night, we may consider the Government pledged to this work. Out of the chaotic dross of Friday nights debate, in which all conceivable questions were asked out of time and place about everything in the four quarters of the globe, we extract with pleasure this sparkling ore. It is, indeed, a brilliant gem. Lord PALMERSTON excepted the Indian Telegraph project from the general rule which refuses Government assistance to mainly mercantile projects,-" it " stood in a somewhat different light." Government vould be ready to pay for the use of a telegraphic line either by the Valley of the Euphrates or the Red Sea. His expectations, however, were on the side of the Euphrates Valley line, which "he believed would succeed." Both these projected lines start alike from Alexandria and end at Kurrachee, and only difer in the modo of crossing the intervening ground. Mr. CRAwFoRD preferred the line by the Red Sea. By one route or another, however, it seems, we are to have now an Electric Telegraph to India. We need not say-because everybody wi}l immediately see-that this will be the greatest ehange in our relations with India that has taken place since our possession of the Empire. We cannot calculate its effects. When we think of it the present is forgotten. Even the troubled present with which we are dealing is flung aside, as the merest temporary affair. Even Indian mutinies are not thought very much of as 'we look forward into this future. Science is more than liberal, she is prodigal in her assistance to us. It seems really as if it did not signify what difficulty we were in; that she would get us out of it. No difficulty is too great for her. It appears as if we could really afford to get into crapesM the resources of escape, repair, and renovation are so exuberant; so that at the very bottom of an adverse emergency, in the very depth of the crisis, and when our Indian reputation is for the moment prostrate, we inaugurate a new era for India, ina which our hold over her wil be ten times tighter than ever, and in which that Empire will be more in the relation of Ireland, or we might almost say an English county, to us than that of a distant coutinent. Fortes fortuna jurat ;-if strength of will does its part, the char- discovery comes in and does the rest for us. Here is an instance :-One great engine for the gover-nment of India has given way. People are saying that we must consider the further use of it as hopeless; that we must throw it aside and look out for another ; that the large native army must be wholly superseded for a smaZler European one. On the other hand, it is said that it wiU never do to govern India entirely by an English axmy; that it would be the worst confession for us to make, and a complete departure from the ground we have all along taken-viz.. that we were naturalized rulers of India, like the reigning races and dynasties that preceded us, goverring India not as successful invaders, but as its adopted guardians. On this latter idea it would be as absurd for us to exclude natives from our army in India as it would have been for our Norman Kings to exclude Saxons; because we are no longer foreigners in India, however we may have been once, but possess a union of interests with the natives, as fellow-subjects alike of the QuEN, sharing the same institutions and enjoying the same liberty. Some may say this is more a theory than a fact, but it must be admitred that this profession has gone on now so long that it would be awkward for us to depart from it and govern India like invaders. What you want, then, is to keep your Native Army, but to have a tighter hold over it. You want such a connexion -with home as would bring the Home Government into a -very close contact with the Sepoy, so that it will cease to be a vague and distant Power to him. But this is exactly what the Electric Telegraph does. The Sepoy will know that everything he does will be known immediately in England. He will feel England close to him every hour of the day. He will never be able to get out of the mysterious proximity, which will sit on him like a nightmare the instant he tries to rebel against it, and stirangle the plot before it is born. But the Electric Telegraph will do more than its own task; it will infallibly bring on a quicker military transit to India,-the passage by the Alexandrian Railroad and Suez. With the rapidity of the news from India we shall not be able to tolerate the present slow sea pawage of troops to India. The freshness of the news wll give a spurto action, and the nearer we are to the spot in knowledge the quicker we shaU wish to get there in person. The truth is, the Electric Telegraph will have a tantalizing effect at firt until we have got accustomed to the new measurement-the new relation of news fiom India to the journey to India. The instant we hear from India of a great mutiny or war by Electric Telegraph we shall wish for an Electric Telegraph to send troops to India by; but, as this is not within the resources of science, we must be content with the Alexandrian route as the next best transit. But, if this will then appear, as it certainly will do, exceedingly slow, the old sea passage will be intolerable. At any rate, then, the Electric Telegraph must be followed by the Alexaudrian route, otherwise we shall only gain six weeks out of five months in our equipment and t,usmission of troops on. any such emergency as, the present to India ,This, of course, wiibalwztl gaining, but. it; wi not be a miraculops changb. Add on, however, the gain of another six weeks in the transit of troops, and you reduce five months to. a little more than two rmonths, as the whole time which is necessary between the very fist outbreak of such a mutiny in India and its repression by troops from England. , Coasider, then, the immense difference that this will make to the mind of the Sepoy. This present mutiny broke out on the 10th of May last, the news of it reached this country on the 27th of June, reinforcements for putting it down left at the end of July, and will arrive in ITndia about the beginning of November. That is at present the interval between a military outbreak and its effecti ve punishment,-the distance between the middle of May and November. But with the Electric Telegraph and the route by Alexandria such a mutiny would have been suppressed by the middle or end of last month by troops that left this country after the news of the event. Such a new machinery, however, we need not say, will act by way of prevention rather than of cure. The Indisu Sepoy will not mutiny when he knows that punishment will follow so certainly and so immediately. He will feel himself under a new power. The ubiquity of England will fill his imagination and subdue his murmurs; it will stand by his bedside, at his table, and at his hutdoor; and we shall have to thank science for inventing a new hold over the Sepoy just at the time when it was so sadly wanted.
WVhen the Gods were implored by the lover in the play to annihilate time and space, it was not for-the purpose of making Btatesmen happy. The miracle has been partially accomplished by means of the electric telegraph, and considerable confusion is sometimes the result. The account of the general quarrel among the Qox,stantinopleEmbasses which appeared in our Foreign Intelligence yesterday came at a considerable interval after the probable receipt by AL DP TuouvszEL of the Imperial order to resume his relations with his colleagues and with the PORTE. It eannot be doubted that Lord PA MmToN had ascertained the coneiliatory d'sposition of the Austrian Government before he made the announcement that the Moldavian elections were by general consent to be annulled. The quarrel among the European Diplomatists seems to have been highly serious, and the triumph of French and Russian policy, which results from an amicable conversation at Osborne, will not destroy the somewhat ridiculous effect of the purposeless demonstrations at ConBtantinople. To the Turks themselves dissensions among their allies and protectors are not unfamiliar. Five years since the French and Russian Embassies were engaged in extorting alternate concessions of certain keys, and stars, and crosses belonging to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The Latins carried their point, but in a few months the Russians crossed the Prith to extort some corresponding advantage for the Greeks. It is highly probable that Austrian policy may discover a set-off against the su(cessful vindication by Frauce and Russia of the freedom of election in Moldavia. In the religious squabble which produced the late war the SULTAw was a mere stakeholder, indifferently situated between the patrons of two gangs of fanatical monks who were quarrelling for a setof worthless trinkets; but the union or separation of the Danubian Principalities is a vital question for Turkey. A second Greece in the North would be equivalent to a Russian Viceroyalty on the frontier, especially if the new Rouman State received a Prince from one of the reigning houses of Europe. Either through the Divans or by other methods, all Turkish Ministries will support the Separatist party, and their efforts will be seconded by all the power of Austria. France, having no immediate interest u`--a- qu-u,i may' probably be satieed, as in'tihe matter of the Holy Sepulchre, by her success in extorting a formal recognition of her importance; Russia, though as much in earnest as Austria or Turkey, is precluded from avowing her motives; England is, like France, rather an umpire than a party to a dispute which must ultimately be settled by the Governments of the three conterminous Empires. The fall of REDSCHRID PASHA appears to have been caused by an occasion which his own prudence or timidity furnished for a telling diplomatic repartee. In announcing the decision of his Government to recoganize the Moldavian elections as valid, the Ottoman Mfinister stated that his determination had received the approval of the English and Austrian Ambassadors. M. Dn THOuVESL instantly replied that he could hold no communication with a Government acting under foreign influence. As an answer to the accusation the SuLTAr dismissed his Vizier, and appointed MuarAsTAP PASHA in his place; but the French Ambassador insisted peremptorily that the eloctions should be annulled, and declined to wait for any inquiry into the truth of the charges against the provincial authorities. On the refusal of the new Ministry to accede to his terms the French flag was formally struck, and the Russian, Prussian, and Sardinian Embassies immediately suspended their relations with the FBoR. The subsequent concession of their demands will, of course, have anticipated the actual departure of the Legations from Constantinople. If any gluttonous appetite for information stil remains unsatiated with Moldavian politics a French pamphlet, published on behalf of the Unionist party, will furnish an abundant supply of charges against the Kaimakan and his subordinate officials. Prince VOGORIDES appears to be a zealous servant of the Ottoman Government, and it seems that he has recently been raised to the rank of RoufiiOulea, corresponding to the grade of Pasha, which is appropriated to Mahomedans. As Minister of Finance under his predecessor, and lately as Governor of Moldavia, Prince Vooownrzs is alleged to have taken all the steps which continental functionaries are wont to ta3e in preparing for popular elections. According to his opponents he has threatened and promised, he has intimidated and he has jobbed. It is said that he has created 40 Aides-de-Camp for his own personal staff, in addition to numerous unnecessary promotions in the army. It is an aggravation of his delinquencies that he is connected by marriage with M. MusuRus, the Ottomnan Minister in London. The irregularities which have been held sufficient to vitiate the elections are perhaps less apocryphal, and they are at least narrated with a fuller knowledge of local probability. The newspapers of Moldavia have been suppressed, with the exception of the Government Gazette, and of a factious journal which advocates in the Hebrew language the separate organization of the provinces. Various Prefects and Sub-Prefects have told obstinate Unionists that they deserved to be flogged for their political heterodoxy. It would undoubtedly have been more becoming to announce, in the language of a French functionary during the late election, that the " Government tolcrated opposition as GOD tolerates "the existence of evil ," but civilization has still much to learn on the banks of the Pruth and of the Danube. One of the grievances which excites the greatest bitterness rel:btes to the reception of the Ottoman Commissioner, -who, according to the official version, was inaulted by some Unionist mobs. The complainants assert, on the other hand, that the o-kponen&, of the provincial Addministration wera.-foroibly prevented from welcoming the represntiafive af the SUrTAN. Far more curiua., im&iations of provincial feel ing are furnished by the allegation that - th-r Raimakan has refused the Catholics pernimion to vote, while he has contrived to enlist a portion of the Greek priesthood in the interest of the Ottoman policy. The LAtin Churches are probably jealous of Austrian interference, while the Greek clergy may didlike the Erastian principles of Rusia. The Mletropolitan of Jassy is, however, a zealous Unionist, and the most amusing document of the series consists in a reprimand which he consequently receives from the Patriarch of Constantinople :-" COvm, by the grace of God "Ecumenical Patriarch, wishes grace, peace, &c., to "the Right Eoly MIetropolitan of Moldavia, the "IRight Hon. Exarch of the frontier provinces, "our well-beloved and affectionate brother, fellow"servant of our humility (de nwtre mo4ie), the "Lord SOPHRONIUS." After this exordium the Patriarch complains that his dear brother has acted in all respects in a manner unworthy of his position and office, and he warns him of the grave consequences which may follow from a continuance of his conduct. The Great Powers, who must settle the dispute at last, as they ought to have anticipated it, may derive useful information from the study of ecclesiastical interests and of sectarian agitation in the Provinces. They will certainly not employ their time usefully in providing for a free and unbiassed election in districts which were lately occupied by a Russian army.
THE PACIFIC. SOUTEAMPTON, xONzy. By the lAagdalena we have files of Panama papers to the 24th ult. The steamer Valparaiso, from Callao July 12, arrived at Panama on the morning of the 21-t, with 14 passengers, $400,000 in specie, chiefly in siver bars, for Engpand, and the semi- nonthly nail from Valparaiso, Callao, and other So0th Pacific ports to the following dates :-Yalpara,o, June 30; Iquiqte, July 1; Callao, 12th; Paita, 16th. At Valparaiso the instalation of Congres hd caaned a little animation. A project was introduced into the Senato to grant a complete and general amnesty for all political offences since 1851, which wa reeived with great favoar and pasd by a unanimous voto; but in the Chamber of Deputies the Government opposed it, and the project wa, negatived by 30 votes to 16. The political trials that had ben so long going on hAd clesed; some of the offenders were condemned to death, but it was thought that tho Government wouald eommute the sentenne. The steamer Valdivia broke part of her machinery in a fearful storm she encountered between Lota and Talcahuano, and was obliged to put back. A number of honses were destroyed by fire in Cochraue-street, Valparaiso, on the 24th of Jane; loss estimated at 200,000 dollars. The only news froma Bolivia is that the elections had resulted in favour of the Government, owing, it was sid, to the intimidation of the military. The Preddent wax shortly about to leave for Suore, with his escort of 2,000 troops. Files of Peruvian papers are to the 4th of July. The only news of importance is that the Vivanco party, whose head quarters were in the neighbourhood of Arequlpa, had shown symptoms of vitality, and one of those events designated in the annals of Peru as "a battle" took place on the 29th nlt. Both parties claim the victory, and the loss of life on both sides was very small. The published accounts of this action vary very considerably. Aoording to that which was considered most relisble, Vivanco left Arequipa on the 27th, with 2,000 men, and met the foroes Of Leneral San Roman on the morning of the 29th. Vivanco, beiug joined by 2,000 of the peasantry, the fight commenced at n al. snd conftnued untl 6 p.m. and resulted in 40 being killed and 100 wounded. After various evolutions effected on the aBW and 2d, probably for the object of avoiding esch btber, a kidrmish took place on the 3d, in whicb General San Roman's bmgage, some money, and papers fell into the hands of the Vivancistas On the 5th inst. President Castifla arrived at Ar1ci, and was to take the command of the army. The Government steamer Huaras was to take troops from Callao to join the Government forces, and the frigate Apur'imac (which still sides with Vivanco) was about to leave the ChinchasIslands, with the object of capturing her. The Apurimac is reported to be in a shokidng condition, and in want of a crew capable of navigating her.

(nOX OUR OWN OOBEMONDlgT)' HAMBU11, Awo. 15, The extremely hot weather we have expeliencee during the lasb few days has done much for the hirvest in the slarroundieg districts, and, exceptibg some cases of sudden illness, has been productive of great benefits to all clames of the com munity. A striking proof of the power of the suu's rays lsa observed on Thursday forenoon at the laboratory of the Civic Artillery Amminition Store, in whici the pyrotechnic artisans carry on their labour. While M. Bergholat ald his two sans were employed ij their vocation and using every possible precaution to rhield their 6perations, the rays of the sun fell on a round piece of glass through the only smamU window exposed to its effects, and set fire co some pdper close at hand and burnt a hole through the boards on the upper floor of the buildiog, through which it roached some ammunition below, which immediately exploded. Fortunately the stock of ammunition was not large, a portion having been previously remov6l to the powder nagazine close by, and the prompt tpplication of water stopped the progares of the burning embers. The pyrotechnist and his two sons had just time to escape, and the only personal iujpry custained was by one of the workmen, who wras slightlyburnt. The alarm, however, wasforsome time considerable for the safety of the adjoining powder store. Accounts have bcen received that at the towru of Bojanuvo, in the province of Posen, in the disicrt of Kr6ben, situate between Nawietz and LUsa, tan through which place the Breslau and PosenRailway -runs, *- ver: large fi-e ha_pened- ins simdla' way ouithe i3WhIni.4o, OD whichOccai ou 9%-oat of 420 houses were burnt down, therebycausing 2,03) persons to be entirely houEeleEs.

FOBBEIGN INTBLLIGBNCR. 'FRANCE. (FRIOM OUBR OWN I A rtion of the following appe;ed in our second Ai. ltion _.V~erh I PARIS, SUDnAY, AUG. 16, 6 Pm. The Emperor's fMte haB not this time been as forlun,ate aS usual in respect of the weather. The rain 'a hich fell nearly the whole of yesterday sadly interfered with the preparations, which were considerable, not only in the public establisnhments and as iregards the official programme, but also on private eccount, as a great -number of persons had come by Tail to Paris to gratify their curiosity. I mentioned yesterday that a Te Deoum was chanted and a service celebrated at N6tre Dame and the other churchea of Paris Cardinal Morlot, Archbishop of Paris, cfficiated in the cathedral. Notwithstanding the unfavourable weather crowds of people filled the theatres, which were thrown open at 2 o'clock, and thousands who could Lot find room proceeded in the midst of the rain and mud to the Champ de Mars to witness a spectacle on a larger scale, and of not les exciting, deicription-the military pantomime; the subject taken from the recent campaign inKabylia. It was ) ell executed, was received with great applause, and repeated with the same success, and to the evident admiration of the multitude of spectators -who stood sheltered from the rain under thousands of umbrellas. The amusements indicated yesterday took place in other parts of the city. At the barrier du TrOne a numerous audience witnessed the same military spectacle enacted in the Champ de Mars. The maypoles also figured in the sports, and, though the wet rendered the task more diffi. cult, a few intrepid and perevering climbers ascended, after several failures, and under disheartening difficulties, to the summit, and gained the silver prize. About 6 o'clock the rain ceased anad the illuminations sprung up in various parts. The crowds continued to flow to the gardens of the Tuileries and the Champs Ely 'es. The gardens were brilliant with lamps and festoons of lamps of various colours and forms, and the faFade of the palace blazed from the basement to the roof. The grand avenue in front, which extends down the centre and opens on the Place de la Concorde, preEented an uninterrupted series of porticoes formed of variegated lamps. It was continued on the Place de la Concorde and along the noble avenue of the Champs Elya6es. The side avenues were lighted up by lustres suspended from the trees. The Palais de l'Industrie, the Corps Legislatif, the hotel of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, that of the htinister of Marine, the Garde Meuble, and the Rue de Rivoli, were all illuminated with taste. In the direction of the Pont de Jena, a gigantic eagle stood on a globe, with wings displayed, and grasping the lightning in his talons, while the lights that gleamed from the triumphal arch completed the picture. The column of the Plaee Vendome, the Barrier du Trine, the Tour St. Jacques la Bouchefie, the Portes St. Martin and St. Denis, the Column of July on the site of the B3astille, the Pont Neuf, the Church of St. Genevi6ve (Pantheon), and the towers of Notre Dame were among the most conspicuous objects in this general illumiunation. About 9 o'clock a rocket shot up into the air, gave notice that another spectacle was about to open, and the crowds that lingered on the ChampsElyseeshastened to theqnays. The fireworks stationed on the heights of the Trocadero had to contendlagainstthatmostformidableenemy,thedampness of the atmosphere, and notwithstanding one or two briliant displays were rather a failure. The bouquet was as good under the adverse circumstances as could be expected. The attempts of the Republican faction being repressed in Italy for some time to come, it now devolves on the moderate, the Constitutional party, to resume the more active position it has for a time abandoned. There is reason to helieve that the Western Powers are convinced of that necessity, and that they are inclined to take up the '; Italian question," such as it was left by the Congress of Paris, and once more exert their influence over the Governments of the Peninsula with the view of obtaining political and administrative reforms. I am assured that a note has been presented in the name of the French Government to the Court of Rome, and that M. de Rayneval and General Guyon have been instructed to impress on Cardinal Antonelli the necessity of losing as little time as possible in promulgating the amnesty, sand granting the concessions which have been so often promised but never completely carried into execution. We learn from private sources that when the Ring of Naples becameacquaintedwith this proceeding of the French Government towards the Pontifical Court he conceived great alarm as he felt that the intentions of the Congress of Iaris were not abandoned as he had too fondly persuaded himself. His Majesty is apprehensive that, if Pius IX. adopt a policy in accordance with these recommendations, public opinion in Naples will manifest itself in so unequivocal a manner that he wil not be in a condition to control it. When the Pope returns toRome (which will probably be in the beginning of September) he will not be able to avoid satisfying the solicitations of the Powers and the demands of his people. Notwithstanding the precautions taken by those about him, it would appear that tae principal cities of his States, and especially the Legations, have succeeded in bringing under the eye of his Roliness the wants and wishes of the population. The retrograde press has done its best to conceal the fact of any addresses having been presented, or having reached the hands of the Pontiff. It is certain, however, that addresses have been presented, not by official persons, but through private channels. But, even if they had not, few kInow better than the Pope the necessities of his subjects and the disorder and abuses of the Roman administration; and if he possessed the moral courage equal to the occasion, he himself could apply the remedy in spite of the opposition of Cardinal Antonelli and the majority of the Sacred College. The Holy Father was to leave Bologua for Florence after the Festival of the Assumptioa (the 15th of August), and great preparations were made in the capital of Tuscany for his reception. II e will, perhaps, profit by this occasion to induce the Grand Duke to adopt a Concordat of the same kind as that of Austria. It is hoped, however, that the Grand Duke and his Ministers will have courage to resist his arguments, and that they will not sacrifice the Leopoldine code, which has proved so advantageous to Tuscany. The intolerance of the Imperial clergy in the Lombardo-Venetian territory must have opened the eyes of the Tuscan Government. On a recent occasion an excommunication was promulgated in Lombardy against several members of the inferior clergy who refused to accept the dogma of the Lnmaculate Conception. The recusant priests have been deprived of their benefices, forbidden the celebration of mass, and the practice of their other sacerdotal functions, and their flocks have been commanded to refuse them an asylum or succour. These acts, we are assured, have produced great irritation among the people, who tore down the excormunication wherever they found it affixed in public. la some cases the authorities were obliged to interfere on behalf of the excommunicated, in order to prevent serious disturbances. Amid these excesses of power and these disorders in other States of the Peninsula, it is satisfactory to see the Piedmontese Government continue frankly and wisely its onward march in a liberal aad national policy, and stil show a noble example to those who have intelligence to appreciate or the courage to imitate it. The Piedmontese Parliament is now approaching its legal term. The decree for its dissolution will he published in October, and the g"lera eleotions for- the new Chamnbers vnl probably take place in November. Reports, for which I am assured there is no foundation, have been set afloat to the effect that these elections were to be postpcned; the reactionist party is doing its utmost to tuum the last political events to account, and is carrying on an active propagandism armong the electors with a view to secure its majority in the ChamberS. These intrigues will, however, fail. The Right may be numerically strengthened, but I believe AL Cavour feels no apprehension with regard to the stability of his Government. It is not certain that the members even of that party will all vote against him, and though there should be a coalition between extreme sections the p ;esent Cabinet will command a sufficient majority. A private letter from Calcutta from a French source, dated the 4th of July, mentions that the o!pinion entertained there was that the siege operations against Delhi would be longer than we supposed i that General Barnard's army barely suMed to mai tsin ita position; that it had repulaed several s irties, but was not strong enough to intercept the crfmmunications of the city lvith the exterior. The besieged were receiving reinforoementa, and ad raised works,wvhich theyhad armed, and which must be taken before the breaching batteries can be erected. Though the English force is numerically weak, the writer says that nothmng cocld be better handled thaa it ie by General Barnard, but that the enemy could not be prevented fromt fortifying themselves. E[e also adds that no doubt whatever is entertained that Delhi will be taken by the English, but repeats his opinion that the siege will be longer than was first supwosed. The Moniteui die l'Armte publishes a letter from Bombay of the 14th of July, which states that the heat is greater this year in the presidency of Bengal than ever was remembered. On the 25th of June the thermometer marked 52 degrees (centigrades) above zero in the English camp before Deli. Several soldiers died that day of sun-stroke. In consequence of a report made by M. de Montigny, Fr}ench consul at Shanghai, who was commissioned to visit the kingdoms of Siam and Cochin-China, the attention of the Governmnent was directed to the expediency of founding a commercial aettlement in those countr.es. It is contemplated to found a maritime and commercial settlement in the bay of Toursie, one of the most advantageous positions in Cochin-China. The Emnperor Gya,. Long formerly ceded this teritory to Louis XVI., and it is considered to belong to France. The French Governmnent also proposes, it is said, to send a military expedition to supporta demand for satisfaction for the insult offiered to the Emperor of tee French in tbe person of M.l de Montigny by tle Emperor of Annum. In military and naval circles the expedition is regarded as certain, but the period at which it is to take pLace is not yet decided. Some of the dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church take a great interest in the matter.I It is said that the French Government are contemplating changes in the diplomatic corps at St. Petersburg, Turin antd Madrid. A rsport is also very rife in French society that L:ord Stratford de RedclifEe is not to return to Constantinople; that he is to be promoted to the rank of earl, and be sUCceeded in Turkey by Lord Hrowden, at present Minister in Spain. THE SUJSPENSIONS OF RELTATIONS IN TUJRKEY. (Fm03a oxrn ownr CoxnrsroNnxDT) CONSTANITINOPLE, Airo. 7. Whatever the future destinies of Turkey may be, it appears certain that none of the European Powers are inclined to surrender their supposed right of influencing them according to their int.erests or wishes. Although the principle of non-interference in questions of internal policy has been over and over again admitted by each. Power, whenever a circumstance occurs wherein it is possible to Interfere, a sort of race ensues, in which every one tries to surpass the others and to force his own views on the Government of the Sublime Porte. It is impossible to lay down in clearer terms than wFas done in the Congress of P'aris the complete independence of Turkey and the illegality of any attempt on the part of any foreign Powrer to mueddle in any way writh the internal arrangements of the Administration, and yet a year is scarcely over, and four of the Poweors who 7signed the Treaty of Panis break off diplomatic relations with the Porte, because th2eir pretensions to dictate an arbitrary lstesp on a purely internal and administrative question are resisted by the Porte!t It would have perhaps delayed the present complication if thle elections had been deferred a fortnight, and if the lists had been revise in Moldavia, as the French Ambassador wrished, since it appears that the refusal of this demand was attributed to foreign influence, and gave rise to a great deal Of bitter feeling, which has hastened the criBis; but it is doubtful whether it would have prevented it. The Porte having always meant to aot with straightforwardness on this question, and believing that the electoral lists had been drawn up in the spirit of fairness it had always enjoined on its agents in the Principalities, considered a delay of elght days sufficient to correct ay omissions or errors which might have passedunnotioed in drawing up electoral lists for the first time in a country where elections were a novelty, but a longer delay seemed dangerous in presence of the powverful organization of the Unionist party, and in refusing it the Ministers of the Porte never thought that they would be accused of want of respect and deference to the wishes of an august ally, t-he Emperor of the F?rench. It does not seem probable that any delay or any revision of lists would have ever given the majority to the UJnionists in Moldavia>. There are many reasons which mke the population of this province generally prefer the maintenance of the status quo. sut the partisans of the Union, though few In number, are excited and noisy. UJnder any circumistances they would protest against elections unfavourable to their views, and endeavour to prove irregularities, which must, be numerous where there are no certain and authentic data on which to base election lists, and no means of ascertaining the moat indispensable qualifications for the right of votingthe age and the property of individuals. The demand to annul the elections would still have been made, and, supported by the Powers wzho advocate the lnion, would have been brought under the conmideration of the Porte, but the result would probably have been the same. No efforts have been spared on the part of the Sultan and his Ministers to bring about an arrangement satisfactory to all parties, and avoid the rupture which has unfortunately taken place. It might, indeed, be con. tended that, with a view to conciliate, he has ceded more than his dignity should have allowred. To a note from the French Ambassador, complaining that the Ministry did not treat the dem,ands of the iFrench Governmnent with. proper deference, the Sultan replied by dismissing the Grand Vizier, Redschid Pasha. The new Ministry, with the venerable Mustapha Pasha of Crete at their head, imnmediately proceeded to examine a second time the demands of the French Ambassador. It appeared, from the admission of Vogorides himself, that the Government agents had interfered in the elections, and Vogorides declared that he authorized this interference in consequence of orders from Redschid Pasha himself, wrho, he says, made him play an infamous part, and now disavowrs him. In the Council of Ministers 13edschid Pasha energetically plO-. tested against such an accusation, and solemnnly declared that he had never directly or indirectly transmitted to Yogorides any orders that were not in strict conformity wzith the Imperial firman. The circumstances, although they did not authorize so arbitrary an act as the immediate anulling of the elections, rendered an inquiry imperative, and the Council of Alinisters, in the nig,ht of the 3d of August, decided that the KEaimakans should be summoned to Constantinople, and an inairy be instituted into their conduct-he annulling or confirmning the elections to be subject to the result of this inquiry. This decision was communicated to the French A mbassador on the morning of the 4th in a note couched in most conciliatory terms, of which I enclose a translation from the French: " A Tia PASS., MnusvnSTRro FOBxci EOAI'v s o HTo " August 4. " the lhst important communications from you>r ix. cellency and the thee other Embassies concerning the elections in Moildavia have again been taken into the meest serious consideration of the Minisers of the SuhThne Porte, aind presented to His Imperial MWajesty the SultRa. As the Imperial Government will not allow the friendly and intimatorelationahsppUysubsiting with theFrench Govern ment, the continuanoe:and permanence of which are the most anxious desire of my Imperial master, to suffeo the slightest alteration, the expressions contained in your Excellenoy's lat communication have caused a deep feeling of concern. '- The desire of the Imperial Government in this matter was, while endeavouring to insure a continuance of the friendly dispoeition of the alied Powers, to execute loyally the duties imposed upon it by the Treaty of Paris, and, while duly considering all observations made to it on the subject of the elections, faithfully to observe all its prescriptions. Itb efforts to obtain unanimity of opinion on the part of the representatives of the allied Powers who took part in the conference which established the mode of eleotion were founded on that dsire, and it did not aDlow itself to act on its soBl judgment in an affair of joint interest. But, aW I it his not been able to obtain this unanimity, and the matter is still in dispute. The Sublime Porte is dispensed from altering a rule formed by all parties without obtaining the consent of all parties. " But at the sne time the Sablm. Porte openly declaes at once that she wvll have no hesitation in performing the duty requirod of her by jusioe, when the Irregularities 'aeged to have occurred in the execation of orders ied by Hia Imperial MajestY and confided to agents appoLuted h9-1His Imperil Majesty shall have been proved in a formal 3uA legal maner. "It is hoped that your Exoallenoy will admit the nscessity in which tho Porte iAplAGed of examinicg and inquiring how her sides ha-ye beenexecutedpreviousy to taking such a grave step. The saieat mode of performing this Inquiry is to bring here tho Kmakahn, who are the heads of the Provincial Governments appointod to execute the orders of the Porte. " It has therefore been agreed upon and decided to write to the Kaimakaus to start imnediately and come here, leav. ing the administration of the country to a suitable deputy. On their arrival here they will be examined on the manner in which they have executed the orders they were charged with executing. After every sort of inqairy shall have been fully gone into the affair will be carefully and impartially scrutinized, and the rosult wlvl be submitted and referred to the impartial judgment of the Embasies of the contracting parties " Should the occurrence of irregularities in the election be formaly proved, it is clear that neither the Porte nor any of the other Governments would acoopt an illegally, con duoted election. "The Porte, therefore, esteems it a daty required by justice to declare at once that it vwll hold itself at liberty to annul it in that case. " In the firm hope that a decision in accordanoe with th preindp!w of fairness and the spirlt of business, and with the respeot and consideration due by the Sublime Porto to the French Government will be agreed to by your Excel. lency and appreciated by the Emperor's Government, I hasten to communicate it to you by order of His Majesty." To this note of tbe Porte-in which the principle of annulling the elections, should it prove on inquiry that they have been irregular, is clearly adraitted by the Porte-the French Ambassador replies by reiterating his demand that they be annulled at once, and intimates his intention of suspending diplomatic relations unless he receives a favourmble answer before 8 o'clock next morning. The Council of Ministers assembles once moretheyare deeply impressedwith th gravity of th circumstances, but, after deliberating all night, they aje unable to alter their previous decision, and they express with great digity their opinion in this second note:- "o Mnistrs a OR Fosu bt N Aet Maj O e S EXCEty LENCY TE ThE2TCH ASIHASSADOR.

"I am ordered by t is Majesty to inform you that Fe entertains no doubt that you 'will again weigh these friendJy commudnictions in the balance of your judgmoet, and tha- youvfllgiv siUfurther proofs of the well-dapesed zeal hihet displayed by your Ecellency for the maintenance of the allianco of the two Governments," A short time afir the recepsion of this note, which does not shou animated by any dery hostile pirit, the French Ambassador struck his fl ak in the way described in a previous, letter, and his three colleagues, to meho. the note was also commun:cated, soon followed his example. Such in the history of the rather etartling event rwhich ha just taken place in Constantinople. It is not possible to foretell what the consequencess will be; but it may be remarked that if all partiea had shown from the pommnencement the conciiatory and moderate spirit of the Porte, it is proba ble mtpt the extrememeeasures resorted to would not have been thought necessary.

The various progresose of the Emperor in Han gary are duly announced in the Wiener Zeioth ng, but your readers 'will hardly care to followv Ris Majesty step by step during his tour. The afternoon and night of the 11th were passed by the Emperor at Kormend, in a castle belonging toPrince IBatthyani, who, as far as hard cash ia concerned, I i oe f herichest lHungarian magnates. The Archduke Ferdinand MaximiliA n and the Archduchess Charlotte are greatly fdtedbyIhe authorities of Trieste, but information has been given me thet the frequent festivals, illuninations, &c., have completely exhausted the resources of the municipality. On the 16th inst. the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Eingdomtwill introduce his bride to the Venetians, and it is probable that their lnpenial EIighnersss 'will remain some days at Venice, as the official advisers of the Archduke have been summoned to that CitY from Milan. Great preparations are being made by the municipaUlty of Milan for the reception of the Archduchess Charlotte, who |is likely te be as great a favourite with the imprdisionable Italians as is e er Majesty the Empress, Great pains are taken to conceal the fact from the know ledge of the inhabitants of this city, but authentic information has been given me that several uriests have been excommunicated by the Lombard bishops for denying that belief in the immaculate conception is necessary to salvation. The sentence of excommunication was first read fromn the pulpit, and then affixed to The doors of the church A few nightshsince two tendarmes s ho were patrolling in the neighbourhood of Volongo met five suspicious-looking persons ained 'with guns. When an attempt was made to disarm the men energetic resistance was offBered, and a regular 5ight ensued, which ended by the Gendarmesa killing tw7o of their opponents and capturing a third. The prisoner and on~e of his lifeless companions had escaped from the fortress of Mantua on the 24th of last May. The longing for some change iD the Adminirtration is so great in the Papal States that the municipal councils of almost all the larger Gities have drawn up petitions, which, however, they will hardly be able to present to His Holiness, as Cardinal Antonelli is much averse to their doing go. Indeed it is whispered that the Cardinal has ordered his confidential agents not to allow addresses of any kind to find their way into the hands of the Sovereign Pontiff. It is a notorious fact that the will of the Pope is good, but he is evidently under the thumb of his haughty and ambitious Minister. A few days since an omnibus was stopped by gendarmes while on its way from Monte Citorio to the railroad station, and three of the passengers arrested. The men were marched off at once to a Roman prison, and it was subsequently related that they were Republicans who had been concerned in the " row" at Padula. How would it be if light upper garments, like those worn by the Austrian soldiers in summer, were sent out to the troops in India t The coats in question, which are made of a kind of unbleached duck or ticking, wear well, and are far cooler aad lighter than the regular uniform coat. Every morning the recruits are drilled for hours together on the glacis in their " fatigue dress," which they asure me is extremely comfortable and "zweck mnasig" (conformable to the purpose). The officers are also aowed to wear stuff coats of the same colour as their cloth unifornL Reliable information has reached me that certain foreign capitalistse are about to establish a new Danubian Steam Navigation Company. The subjoined informatioa relative to the already existiog Danuoian Steam Corapany will prove interesting :-1. The Austrian Danubiau Steam Compana has above 100 steamers and a large flotilla of steamtugs and barges for the conveyance of heavy goods and corn. 2. It has purchased the best coalMines in the neighbourhood of the river. 3. It has the most experienced captains, pilots, and sailors in its service. 4. It has the best landing-places at the principal towns between Passan and Galatz. 5. It has large establishments for the construction and repair of its vessels at Chor-Neuburg, Peath, Pansova, and Turno-Severin. 6. It has just constructed a magnificent winter dock (wointer-hafen) for its boats at Pesth. 7. It ha's an enormous capital. 8. The State has guaranteed eight percent., including about one-half per cent. towards the sinkinlg fund, oa the capital. To the foregoing it may be added that neither Austria nor Bavaria is likely to grant to foreign countries the right of " cabotage" (coasting trade,. The Austrian Company has already loweredi ts charges for the conveyance of goods, and it would of course reduce its present exorbitant fares for travellers if there should be any competition on the river. It is said that M. Masjon, who was formerly in the service of the Austrian Company, is to be the manager of the newe3tablishment. Yesterday there was a slight irrprovement in Northern Railroad stock, as it was reported on 'Change that the direction of the company " had declined to accept the concession for the West Galician Railroad.' If the directors had any choice in the matter they would, doubtless, refuse to have anything to do with the railroaa in question, but the die is cast, and the line from Oswicin to Cracow now belongs to the Northern Railroad Company. Before the Emperor quitted Vienna for Hungary he definitively settled the matter, by writing on the petition of the Northemn Railroad Company to be permitted to cede the line in question to the East Galician Company that he did not feel himself " moved" (bewegen) to grant its request. The East Galician Railroad will now begin at Cracow instead of Przemyal. A trial of the railway between Coccaglio and Palazzolo, in Lomh bardy, was made a fewr days since, and everything would have gone off well if some villain or villaius had not laid a heavy iron bar across the rails. The return train ran at full speed against the bar, and as a matter of course was thrown off the rails. Two of the men employed on the railway were killed on the spat, and several others severely wounded. It is expected that the whole line between Venice and Milan will be completed by the end of next montb. As it has been settled that the elections in Moldavia are to be repeated, the Ost-Deutsche Post considevs it advisable to let the public know that some of the diplomatists in Constantinople went beyond thoir instructions. " It is not improbable," says the non-official organ of the Austrian Foreign-office, "that Lord Stratford and Baron Prokesch forwarded the note of the 18th to the Porte on their own responsibility." A Polish correspondent of the Frankfort Jounal says it is strongly suspected in the kingdom of Poland that some of the officers and soldiers who have recently been dismissed from the Russian army with a year's pay have gone to JoIn the mutineers in India. " Certain it is that the Russian Government has for the last three years been systematically exciting the Chinese, Persians. and the heirs of the Great Mogul against England.' Of course no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the foregoing assertion, but a very strong impression prevails in this country that Russian agents are even now busy in the provinces to the north and north-east of Delhi. The Emperor will return to Vienna late to-morrow evening, and not continue his Hungarian tour until the 23d inst. To-day His Majesty is at Stuhlweissenburg, the capital of the Comitat of the same name. Lady Clarendon arrived here yesterday evening. ITALY. (FROM OUR OWN5 CORn R>PONDiN.) TURIN, AUG. 14. From every part of Italy the cry is still "No news." The Pope continues to hold his Court at Bologna, considerably to the annoyance of the Bolognese, who foresee increased rates in every day the Pontifical visit is prolonged, without the remotest hope of an;y corresponding advantage from it. A letter received from there this morning says the waaUs of the town have lately been placarded with the following addreas:- " Bolognese,-Tho journey of the Pope in his States wiU fgure in the annals of Italy as a new disaster for these desolate provinces. Thisjourney had not for its object either to see andatudy more closely the evilsand the wants of the people,or to hear and meet the just demands which time brings forth, orto sow theseedsof asolidand honest administration. It has been nothing but a vain par'y of pleasure-an immoderate thirst of ovations-an insatiable desire to consecrate the triumph of reaction. The Pope has rejected the example of those Sovereigns who, cleverly profiting by similar points of contact with their people, have endeavoured to strike out a way of conciliation between the subjects and the Government-a commencement of transition from the past to tho future. He, on the contrary, deaf to the wants of his people, wanting in all prudent policy, attentive only to the voice of the factious caste that surrounds him, came to amuse himself by walking on the almost smoking ruins of his people, who, with the instinct of acute suffering, placed their faith in him. Bat the ilosion has no vpassed away from overyone. AU bearts to-day weop, shudder, and curse. Nevertheless, Bolognese, don't imagine that it would be an act of civii courage worthy of us to disturb our apparent tranquillity by uttering a fresh cry of agony, a new protest against new outrages. No, the -world has judged, and it will jr,dge worthily, of our attitude, because European civilization understands that our silenceis not content-our inaction not a baseness. Uselesm demonstrations could not serve our cause. The anger of women is contemptible for a people who comprehend the importance of their mission, and who only wish to accomplish it by the experience gained at the expense of much blood and suffering. Is it not shameful to see that so many poltroone, degenasate magistrates seated on the municipal benches, have not dared to speak in favour of the public cause, in favour of their clients, as they weze bound to do by their official position? These men are not only the enemies of our country, but of the Sovereign. To deceive the Prince is in fact the act of an enemy, and, in the position they hold, they have deceived him as much by their silence as by lies. " But the country will keep account of their deserts. Times are changed, and the Government of the priests is in the hands precisely of men who will not admit this truth. What gives us confidence, however, is, that that which formerly was only a belief of secret conventicles has now become the opinion of the vast majority. It is no longer with mystery that liberty, or national dignity, is now spoken of; it is openly, in face of the world, and before all the potentates of the earth. It is thus that liberty combats tyranny th success; it is thus that truth triumphs over error; and in this generos city it is esteemed an smmor;al glory to Sfght in the foremost ranks. "There romains for us long sacriices to make, and those impo:ed by actual circumstances are still more terrible. The trium,h of ounr cause annot be delayed, but let us remember that without virtue it caunot succeed. Perseverance, then- greoat activlty in ideas and acts; patience in our griefs, an1 faith in the future. The events which gene- rally prepare the trne independence of a people are ans| grievons as the fatigues of the soldier previouls to tha battle.I Let us live and unite in one sole idea for the great day, an,d when the cry of deliveran!ce moves our souls in immolating our affections on the altar of the country we may act for one object only,-to live and die free and independent." While His Holiness holds his Court in Bologna his lieges in the Eternal City are preparing for his reception on the 5th of next month. The municipality has voted 7,000 scudi to be distributed to the people on that occasion, at the rate of a paul a-head, 1 butthia is not to be given in money to the poor themselves, but divided among the parish priests, who will buy bread and meat, and distribute rations of that value. - In the meantime the Romans have been edified by the publication of a monster deree of 54 articles for the regulation of hackney coaches. Every one who is acquainted with Rome must recollect the great want of order end subordination among the class of Jebus, who tilt furiously at the unfortunate pedestrian who does not employ them, and who cheat abominably the still more wrethed passenger who trusts himself to their guldane. The Romans hailed with satisfaction, then, the issuing of a decree that might be expected to impose a check on these furious extortioners, but great was their surprise and mortification to find, aiter wading through the whole 54 articles, that there was not a word about a tariff, so that the hackney coachmen remain as mnuch as ever masters of the position I The official Neapolitan Gazette of the 5th int. announces that, '- On the 3d was solemnly laid the first stmne of tbe temple which the army and the navy have voi:d to the very holy and immaculate Virgin, and which is to be ereted at their expense on the spot where the King's life was pre served by Divine providence." The Oazretta del Pcpolo contains the following curious paragraph relative to Mazzini:- "A friend who ham been to Genoa on business assares us most positively tbat Joseph Msarini, in plaoe of makig his wil, as had been done by Pisacarne, thought, on the contrary, of secarng for himself a god life annuity.

MATIN Mr Slade and Mr. Coleridge were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mlr. Prideaux for the defendaint. I This was an aotion for a libel. Tbe plaintiff was a pay. master in the navy, and the defendant was a retired major in the Artillery. Both parties resided at Plymouth. For 20 years the plaintiff had asted as vicar's churchwarden. A pew in the church had been set apart for the Mayor and Corporation of Plyhiiouth, but the defendant had insisted on using the pew. The plaintiff accordingly gave orders to the verger that if the cefendant came the verger was to intimate to him tbat the w was appropriated for the Mayor and Corporation. on the 7th of December the defendant went into the pew. The verger told him he must not remain there, but the major refused to leave. On the following dvy the defendant went to the church and comnplained of the verger's conduct, and £aid he had told a deiberate falsehood. $o matters continued until March, when the bishop was coining on his visitation. The defendant gave the plaintiff notice that he should complain to the bishop, bet when the bishop carne he did not do so. In the following May the archdeacon cawne to the defendant, presented the plaiotiff, and afterwards stated that the plaintiffhad t.ld a deliberate falsehood, and said he was a l5ing and insolent blackguard, and he subsequently repceated tbe charge in a letter he wrote to General Donstanville, who handed the letter to the plaintiff. This wvas the libel complained of. The jury ultiLately returned a verdict for the plaintiffDamages, 751. DEGB3E V. PRY. Mr. Colvin and Mr. Barstow were counsel for the plain. tiff; and Mr. Smith and Mr. Kuslake for the defendant. The plaintifis were merchants, carrying on business in Austinfriars, having a branch establishment at Rangoon. The defendants were ship and insurance brokers, in Fenchurch-street. The action was brought to recover the sum of 268. lls. lld., which had been advanced by the plain. tiffs at Rangoon to the captein of a vessel called the Golmelsa, of which the defendants were the owners, for the necesaary disbursements of the vesseL The plaintiffg alleged that the advances were made upon the credit of the defendants, whereas the defence was that the advances were made upon the credit of another firn. The jury found a verdct for the plaintiffs. BiL&CrctOoR% V. THE BRISTOL AND EXETER RALWAY cOb1PAiY. Mr. Phinn and Mr. Barstow were counsel forthe plaintiff; and Mr. Butt, Mr. Collier, and Mr. Stone forthe defendant. The plaintiff was a poor woman, residing at Weston-super. Mare, and she brought this action to recover compensation for the injury she had sustained by the death of her husband, who was killed by an accident, which the plaintiff said was attributable to culpable neligence on the part of the persons employed by the Bristol and Exeter Railway Company. It appeared that the deceased was engaged in assisting to remove a large stone, weighing more than 4 tons, from the company's trucks to a waggon by means of a crane belonging to the company, when the chain of the crane broke, and the beam struck the deceased in such a manner that he died in a short time afterwards. This chain had previously been condemned, but was still continaed; it freguently broke and was as frequently mended. After the accident the crane was repaired, and a new chain was got. which was much larger and stronger than the old one. Upoi thisoccasion a break was used to the crane. Several points ol law were raised, and it was arranged that they should be left for the Court above, and that the plaintiff should be nonsuited; but should the Uourt be of opinon that the action was maintainabl the damages to be Plaintiff nonsuited. A.ua. 15. (Before hrr. Justice COLEITDaiB.) RICHARDS (IN FORmA rAuPRIS) v. scOTr. This case created very great interest. Mr. Prideaux and Mr. Speke were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Smith, Mr. Karslake, and Mr. Coleridge for the defendant. This was an action brought by Samuel Richards against John Scott to recover certain property situate at Stognmber, in Somersetshire. From the course the cause took it is only necessary to state that the plaintiff claimed as heir-at-law of the Rev. Simonl Slocomb Richards, alleging that one Francis Richards was illegitimate, and that the Rev. Simon Sl. comb Richards, under whose will the defendant claimed, was a lunatic at the time he made his will. The questions therefore were whether Francis Richards, one of the sons of the claimant's grandfather,wasillegitimnate, andthen whether the Rev. Simon Slooomb was a lunatic at the time he made his will. To prove the plaintiff's case {he following evidence was adduced.:- Proof of the defendant's being in possession of the property, a dwelling-house and 26 acres of land was first given. The defendant admitted that he had paid rent to the Rev. Simon Slocomb Richards, under whom he had held the estate a great number of years. The present Plaintiff had brought a former action, but not as a pauper. The plaintiff did not then appear, and there was a verdict for the defendant. The costs of the former action had been paid, the plaintiff dispesing of tho whole of the little property he then had to pay those costs, and then he sued in the present action as a pauper. J. Dancan Ostrehan, vicar of Creech St, Michael.-I produce the register book of marriages, I find in the marriages, December10, 1756, Samuel Richards and Susannah te were married in this church.

Cross-examined.-The register book was kept in the parish church. It is much mutilated. The births appear to be written in the same hand. The population is 1,700. In 1755 there is only one birth entered There are two in 1756, and two in 1757. In 1759two, and there it stops, Samuel Rich ards.-lam the claimant. My father's name was Thomas White Richards. He married Joan Wilmot. His father was Samuel Richards and his wife was Snsannah White They lived In the parish of Creech. My father had a brother Simon, a clergyman; he has been dead miany years. He hwd a son, the Rev. Simnon Slocomb Richards, and a daughter Jemima Ann. They are bo h dead. I had un uncle John, who was younger than my father. He is dead. He lived at Creech. I had another uncle, Samuel Richards, who was the youngest - he is dead He lived at Creech. The Rev. Simon was older than my fathar. Frank Richards was the son of John Richards. I have a Bible which belonged to my father, Thore is an entry in it of the birth of Thmas White Richards. Cross-examined. -The book has always been in the family. I have had it six or seven yeans. I recollect it as long s ever I can recollect. My father had it. I am above 70. The writing was all in the book when I first recollect it. It has not been written over since, to the best of my knovwledge. Mr. SaTrrH objected to the entry being read. The entry professed to be a copy from a co-py of a register, and was not the natural effasion from the mind of the party making it. This was an entry with reference to the birth of Thomas White Richards, In whose possession the book was. There was no proof of the entry being In tho handwriting of any member of the family. The bookvwas not printed tll 20 years after the date to which the entry referred. Mr. PRIDRATJX contended that the entry was admissible. The Blble had been handed down in the family. The entry was a declaration of the fact recorded, although it professed to be a copy of the register. The JuDGZ said they did not show by vhom it was written, nor that it was a declaration by a member of the familv. An illegitimate son might have written it.

It appeared thatM Bo.ie. ridge had been Mrs. Hatch, and ace thea kept th'&An. chor pulicbobuse at Tewkesbury. She woo avery beautthe woman, and the plaintiff became deeply in love with hei and paid his addresses to her. It to happened that the, plaintiff had money left to him, and Mfrs. Hatch uat sto borrow money of him, and when he had small sws mr. Hztch used in the moat friendly xmsnier to take itVsat of his pocket, until she was indebted to him in a eunaler.- able sum. The plaintiff at leagthfound she was not acaver. Jng his addresses, but was favouring another person, an& in a moment of frenzy he enlided in the 11th Husan jnd was sent to the Crimea. On his return to England he #ar discharged from the Huars because he was under beiiht. He found Mrs. Hstch had become Mm Botheridge, and he then asked for his money, and was obliged to lmin ibhisaction. In cross-examination the plaintiff mid he bad eil Jars.

A great many times when he W as asleep she had taken his trousers, nd then the money, the next morning ahe had told him how muck mone had taken).

Hehsed t get money from his friendefor the purpose of going to th Anchor, and then she used to take it and say, what wu one's was the other's, and he used to say, "Oh ye, all right;` and when it wasi all gone then he might go anywhere else. Was now 27 yearsof age, thevwidow was 48. For the defendent this was Asigmatized as an impudent attempt to pick a womads pocket. In 1851 the plaintiff began to istrade himself upon m Hatch, taking Up his abe at the Anchor, and he tried to obtin the hnd and the heart of Mrs. Hatch, but he failed in every attempt. He ran up a score there, and deposited his watch and other articles. In 1854 he came there drunk; the called in a policema ; he knocked him down,was taken before a macis. trate, and was finued 55. After this the widow gave u 1. is watch and the other things, in order to get rid of,i She had never borrowed anything of him in her life, nd he had never paid anything for her.

Shehadgivenhimrmoneytogoandpay tbilL for her. He bad also paid other sums for her, but she had gOven him the monev to do so. He had nade efforts to ir gratiate himself ic her favour, but she always gave him a flat denial. She advanced him many little aums, and he gave her his watoh and chain, and some Irish cloth as tecnrity. In August. 1854, he came to the house tipsy,4and wanted half a pint of rum. She refused to let him have it. He ocked up a row, and she gave him in charge. He afterwards called and said he would contradict the rumours that wereabroad. He cUed again,andsheshookhands ith im and said she hoped he would get a situation and keep it and mend his ways. Never tookinoney out of his pocket.

He said he would buy another. Did not know of his having money left him. Heard something about it in the bar. He came and lived in her house for some time. He still went on courting, but if the lady had no mine for it it did not go on very smoothly. He never paid money for.her, but he paid Sherrard something for bottles for portwine, but she had not told him to do so. When he came back he brought her the bill, n aaid4±"ow dare you do so r' and he aid he thought itrwouldAake him look big.

Re-examined.-The message ws to ask Mrs. Botheride to send him some money, as he was very badly off, and she refused. le then said he shouldgo to law with h* and take her character away, and sy and swear that thich should do. John Brimnmell lived at Tewkesbury. Retollectedihe time when the plaintiff was before the magistrate, in 1854. Bailed him out of prison. Said, "You've got yourself in a mess; have you got any money-do you think tbe mistress at the Anchor will do anything for you I" He slid he did not know, and asked him to go and ask her. WAtness went to her. She sid she had got his watch and chain, and linen enough to make a shirt and a half, and she would give it all up, and she gave it to the-witnems John Partridge, clerk to an attorney at Tewkesbary.- In 1855 saw Bobeon at the Anchor; he bebavec very badly and lent him a shirt. He asked Mrs. Botheridge to lend him 5s., but she refused, and witness lent him 10s. Cross-examined.-Prequently went to the Anchor after office hours. Did not know there 'were late sittings there. She caUed him " Dan." Ho was not supposed to know anything, but he was sweetish there. Wis not present at their sweethearting matters. She frequrently called witness " Jobn." Did not see their sweetheirting. Did not look through the window. His memory wms refresbed by the clean shirt and the collar.

The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. AuGusT 17. GURNEY V. EVANS AND ANOTHER Mr. Prideaux was counsel for the'plaintiff and Mie Rars. lake for the defendant. This was an acti9a upon a bill of exchange given for some timber. The matters were very complioated. The plaintiff thought that the parties (father aid son) were in partnership, but it turned out they were not, and the father had since become banlkrupt, and the struggle on ore side was to make the son the debtor, and on the other to throw the liability on the father. The interest in the casewas entirely confined io the pirties, Eventually the jury found a verdict for the defendant This finished the buiness of the asiz at concluded the Western Circuit.

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Monday, Aug. 17. The August session of the above Court commenced this mnorning before the Right Ron. T. Q. Finnis, Lord Msayor; Mr. T. Ch%mbors, Common Serjeant, Aldermen Sir C. Marshall and Sir R. W. Carden, Mir. Sheriff Keats, Mr. Alexander Crosley and Mr. James Anderton, UnderSheriffs,, &c. It appears by the first edition of the calendar that there are 106 prisoners for trial at this sessicn, which number wMi probably be increased to 125 before the grand jury are discharge i. The UO)MMON SRRJFAT, when the grand jury had been sworn, ssidhe did not think it necessarv to occupy much of their time, becnuse the business they would have to dispose of would necessarily detain them for several days, and he did not desire to add to their labours. They were lorobably aware that a Bill had been under discussion in Par ament, the object of which was to relieve the grand jury from the discharge of their duties, so far as the jurisdiction of this court was cocerned., and he was not surprised that this measure had occasiontd a good deal of constitutional jealousy, and that the proposal for the abolition of so acciens an intituLtion as the grand jury, which had on several occasions been found of so much importance, would excite a good deal of discussion. Hoe mlust say that, with regard to some charges that might be made against the subject, it appeaed to him that a grand jury wae very necessary, and that with reference to these cases it ought not to be donte away with, In ordinary caees of felony, hovrever, where the charge was most carefully and publicly invesigated by intelligent and able magistrats, lt would seenm unnecessary to have the matter again inqurred into before the prisoner was put upon his tnial, Tee subject was, however, one of very great public importance, and would no doubt be fully discused and COnS deied before any alteration was made in the law upon the sav ject. lis Lordship then proceeded to call tho attention of tOex graud jury to some of the cases that were lkely to be pr sented to them. He said there was one charge of murder in which the only qutstion they would have to consider wes whether the death of the deceased was occasioned by the violence of the prisoner, and any point that might in^identaUy arise in the course of the inquiry as to the state of his mind was not a subject for their consideration; but it would be their duty to find the bill, and leave the other qcetlion, of the sanity or insanity of the prisoner,to be disposea of by the Couxr and the petty jury. There was a charge of manslaughter against three men, one of whom was the driver, another tbe stoker of an engine, and the third a sI alman, all of wbom were employed upon the North ient Railway; and the charge arose out of a very melan. choly accident that took place upon that railway on a Sunday in the month of Jane last. The oftence of manslaughter was murdervith *ut malice, andthe questiontheywouldhave to consider was whether the accident was occasioned by either of the persons accused having omxiitted to perform ia a proper manner the duty that devolved uipon him, or doing that duty in a careless and negligent manner. The offence of manslaughter would equally be established either by doing an il egal act or by doing a lawful act in a negligent and careless manner, the absence of proper carue i discharging a lawful duty rendering the party equally liable. They would hear what duties the signalman had to perform, and would then inquire whether he was proved to have neglected those duties. So ir. the cases of the enginedriver and satker, it it should be made to appear that they had nsglected to keep a look-out, which they certainly ought to have done, and if these facts were made out, and it was establishe; to their satisfaction that the neglect of any or of all the parties was the cause of the accident, they would in law be guilty of the crime of manslaughter, and it would be the duty of the u nd jury to return a true bill for that offence. ohere was a serions charge against two *men of having stabbed another in the Queen's Bench Prison. There could be no doubt in this case that the n,an was stabbed by one of the parties, and the only question for the considerationof the grand jury was whether both ought to be included in the bilL It appeared to he suggested on the part of the prosecution that both the persons accused weat to the prison with one common object, and that while one of them was iU the act of stabbing the prosecutor the other made use of an expression that was caloulated to encourage him in the commission of the act. If this fact should be proved, it would be their duty to find the bill ; but i' it should appear that he was merely present, and did not interfere iU any way with what was being done by his com. panion, they ought not to do so. There was a cbarge of burglary against three men which was of rather a peculiar character. IS appeared that they had obtained possession of somegoods, as was alleged, in an improper manner, and that thesa goods were taken from them and placed in a house -for security, and that at a late hour of the night the other parties broke into this place and regained po-session of the property, and it was under these circumstances that the charge of burglay was preferred. It appeared to him, how. ever, that In law this charge could not he supported, because 'the act was evidently done on the supposed assertion of a right; and, although that right might not exist, and the proceeding would probably have rendered the parties liable to an action for trespass, in his opinion it clearly did not amount to felony, and if the facts sbould turn out to be as L- suggested, he should advise them to ignore the bill. There were two or three cases of arson, some of which vere capital charges, as it was alleged that persons were in the house whose lives might have been endangered at the time the act was committed, and in these cases the material points for their consideration were whether it was made out that any portion of the actual building was set on fire, and whether the act was established against the person accused. The only remaining case to which he considered it necessary to allude vas a charge against a man of having stanbed his wife and another person, and the offence appeared to have been committed under a feeling of jealousy and a belief entertainedby the prisoner thathis wife had been unfithful to him. He was bound, however, to teWl them that even if this should turn out to be true it would be no justificas Uon for the prisoner in this particular case. A nman would be justified in killing another detected by him in the not of adultery, bat in this case the parties met accidentally in the street and the prisoner then ciuimitted the offence imputed to him, and therefore if the evidence made out these facts it would be their duty to find a true bill. Charles Harrison, 36, grocer, was charged with stealing a large quantity of sugar, the property (if Messrs. Cooper and Co.. his masters; and Ryder Durant, 29. and Roger Durant, 27 {brothers), were charged with receiving the sugar, know. lag it to have been stolen. Mr. Bodkin conducted the prosecution ; Serjeant Pay wes specially retained with Mr. Gent to defend Roger Dnrant; Mr. Sleigh defended Ryder Durant; and Mx. Metoalfe appeared for Harrison. This case oocpied the Court a good many hours, but the facts lay in a narrqw compasss The prosecutors carry on a very extensive business as wholesale grocers ia Monument. yard. and the prisoner Harr1son was in their service in a confidential capacity. It seemed that it was the cutom of the prosecutors business to purchase large quantities of sugar from the dillerent refiners and leave it in their poese. sion, and when they themselves made sales to their customers they sent an order to the refiners for the delivery of the required amount, and books were used simiar to bankers' checkbooks, with the usual counterfoils, from which such orders were taken. It Was the duty of the pmisoner Harlon to filL up those orders, and there appeared lo be very little doubt that he had taken advantage of the l onfidence placed in him to sead fictitious orders to cifferant refiners, and by this means he obtained I possesSion of a large quantity of sugar-in one in. I dtance over 5cwt., and in another 1Icwt. having been by this means misappropriated. As regarded ihe other prisoners the evidence went to show that Roger Durant had formerly been in the ser:diD of the prosecutors, and was weU acquainted with the mode in which their busi. ness was conducted, but was discharged ia March last. It appeared that a' this time, in consequence of some in. formation that came to the knowledge of Messrs. Cooper, they called in the assistance of Webb and Scott, two of the city detective police, who appeared to have exercised a good deal of tact and ingenuity in investigating the matter, and it was ascertained 'hatthe two Darants carried on business as grocers in Lillypot-lane, and that the greater part of the sugar that had been obtained by mneans of the orders written by the prisoner Harrison had immediately afterwards come into their possession, and was sold by them to a grocer at Torquay under the market price. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty against an the prisoners. Sentence was deferred, 1NEW COURT. (Before 31r. PRENDERGAST, Q.C.)

Wi3liam Jones, 28, labourer, pleaded " Gnuilty" to stealing a clock valued at 21., the property of HIpry Eycott Wood, and a coat and biUs of exchange valued at 6641., the property of Ecdward Hanway. Lr. Stanton prosecuted. The clock and coat, in the pocket of which were the notes, had been stolen from the prosecutor's counting.house, in Copthall-court, city, and were found in the prisoner's posses. ion shortly afterwards. Sentence, 18 months' imprisonment.
POLICE. WEs=S¶tER..oWilfl1m Brewster, a middle-aged man, was finally examined, charged -with systematic enabezzle. mont of smaU sums received for his employer. Mr. Henry Lovebond, eroprietor of the Cannon Brewery, Chelsea, said, that the pnsoner had been in his service since February last as a drayman. It vas his duty to deliver beer and receive moneys from custoniers. He was to account for all moneys received during the day on his return in the evening. lie gave in bis book every evening. He did not account for 14s. received from Mr. Bich, of Kennington-oval, on Friday week, but returned the sum of f6s. cd. as paid by that gentleman, and returned waste beer from him, called "nullage," to the extent of six gaUons, making 12s. 6d. to be credited to the customer, instead of 18s. The receipt and counterfoil in prisoner's book ought to correspond, but did not. Mr. William Birch, of 2, Xennington-oval, said, that he had beer from Mr. Lovebond's brewery, and paid the prisoner for it. On Friday week he paid the prisoner 14s. in money, and was allowed 4s, for rather more than four gallons retured in the cask (nullage). Prisoner gave him the receipt produced, agreeably with the account. James Xage, 147 B, proved apprehending the prisoner and telling him ne was charged with embezzling 7a. 6d., when he replied that he did not know what he meant. Two bags were found on him, -one containing a five*shilling piece and a balf-crown, which he said was Mr. Birch's money. He added, ho supposed he must have made a6 mistake in paying the money in, as he did not mean to keep it. On the day prisoner received Mr. Birch's account witness watched the prisoner, and saw him, when near Kenrington Church, empty the contents or bottoms of two casks into one, and on arriving at Tulse-hil he emptied what remained in three other casks coUected into the same one, and subsequently added the bottoms of another to it. There were four other oharges of a similar natnre proved against the prisoner. The accused, who contented himself by saying that he was "Not Gailty," was fully committed for trial upon the 'whole of the charges. An application was strongly urged by Mr. Martin, his solicitor, to allow prisoner to put in bail, but Mr. Arnold considered it so bad a case of falsifying accounts in his book shat he refused. WORStp.SrTR.-Bernard D6vis was charged with robbev Mr. Wiliaia Gilbertson is an oil and colourman in the Hackney-road, and retired to bed at 2 o'clock on Sanday morning, having carefully seen that the whole of his house wvas secured. *' About half-past 3," said Mr. Gilbertson " I was taken with the most violent pains in my back, ana my wife got out of bed to get some oil off the manteishelf to rub it with, when all of a sudden she stumbled over something or somebody upon the floor, which so alarmed her that she screamed out. I jumped out of bed immediately, and found the room door wide open, which I knew I had closed when we went to bed, and, hearing a noise on the stairs, I looked over the bannisters, and, perceiving a man at the bottom of them, I called out 'Curse you, that's your game, is it? Then I 'went to the front window and called for the police, and on one of them coming up I puUed my head in agaiu, got a light, and on going to the front door saw the prisoner in custody. I then examined the house, and found that an entrance had been forced through a door I had myself fastened, leadi on to the leads, and that a large box in our bedroom had been actually opened, its contents, consisting of various portions of wearing apparel, aU strewn about the floor, and that a silver watch, gold brooob, neckerchief, portemonnale, and numerous other articles, which were safe in the trunk 'when we went to bed, had been stolen." Mlilton, 150 N, sald,-I heard the cries of " Police" from the prosecutor at his window, and from what he told me I ran round to the back of thehouse just in time to see the prisoner drop from the wall. He had neither shoes nor stockings on, but I found those in his pockets. On the way to the station he said to me, " I shonld have done it nice and clean badn't the woman got out of bed for the oil, and I really thought I must have laughed outright at hearing their con. versantion; I was obliged to hold my band tight over my mouth to prevent it. It's of no use denying it, of course ; I did take the articles from the box, except the 'watch ; that I dropped in the street.' The prisoner's hands and feet were bleeding very much, and on examining the place I found a skylight broken. The prisoner, who heartily laughed at the scene he had described to the officer, bad nothing to say in defence, and, the depositions having been taken, he was fully committed to Newgato for triaL THAmES.-William Smith, late a seaman belonging to the American ship Superior, was charged 'with feloniously cutting and wounding Richard Faulkner on board the General Steam Navigation Company's ship Rainbow, in the course of her last voyage from Rotterdam to London, and was remanded for a week, L snBErs.-James Cutler, a journeyman, painter, was cearged with neglecting his four ohildren, and keeping them in a frightfully disgasting state. The unfortunate children were brought into court, and presented a spectacle at once distressing and disgusting. The heads of aU were closely shaven, and deep holes and extensive sores were all over their surface, produced by the burrowing of tbe enormous quantities of vermin allowed to accumulate on them. Dixon, one of the summoning officers, said that on Thurs. day last the Rev. Mr. Cotter, a clergyman belonging to St. George's Cathedral, waited on the Hon. G. C. N orton at this court, and called his attention to the wretched state in wrhich the childrea of the defeiadant were allowed to remain. Mr. Norton directed him (Dixon) at onceto proceed to the place and look after the children; and on going to their lodging, one of the maost disgustimg sights he had ever witnessed presented itself. The unfortunate children were permitted to wallow about in their own excrement, so that the stench of the place was of the most intolerable desciptlon-so bad that he was glad to get out of it. The children, besides, were covered with vermin, whieb aecumu. lated in such numbers in their heads as to actually burrow holes in their skin. He (Dixon) comnm,nicated the case to one of the relieving officers witboat delay, and the children were at once removed to the workhouse. The reliev,ing officer of St. Mary's, Newington, confrmed Dixon's statement, and said that every shred of the wretched clothing the children had on 'when brought to the workhouse had to be consumed. The officer further sid that in January last the defeudant, his wife, and children had been passed from the parish of Lambeth to that of NewinKton, where they had a settlement, but seon after they discharged themselves from the house. Shortly after that, as he (the relieving officer) understood, the 'ife left the prisoner, and the case as respected hins or his familU had not been brought under his notice from that time untl informed by the officer, Dixon, of the state in which his children were discovered. The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said he had always worke hard when he could get it to support his children aud always devoted the greater part of his Sundays to washing and cleaning them, and called two witnesses, who said he always gave the ctoildren plenty to eat, and seemed fond of and attentive to them. rx. ELLioTT observed that it was perfectly evident from the appearance of the poor children that they had been most shockingly and grossly neglected, and asked if anythinDg was known of the prisoner. Dixon replied that he had been brought before Mr. Norton more than once for Musing his wife, and he (Dixon) therefore did not wonder at her leaving him. He had also been relieved more than once or twice from the poor-box, The AGISmTMrT ultimately directed that the case might stand over for a week, to give time to inquire about the recent conduct of the prisoner and his means of supporting his children, and directed that the children, two of whom are m a very precarious state, should be taken back to the workhouse.

ZICHOLLS (OsCrL MANAGER OF THE PORT OF LON-TON AqCmAkw on-A.-'N The LoRD CHAI4CELIOR, in deiivering tie judment of the House in thig appeal from the decision of the Lords Justices, said that the Port of London Ansurance Company was projected in 1847, and on 1'ts formation in April of that ye: the usual deed of mett7ement was drawn up, whicl conitained a olarse to this effect-namely, that for the purpose of effecting an absolute diesolution of the company, a resolution should be reduced to writing, which should be read and carried by a majority of two-thirds of the share. bolders, representing two-thirds of the shares of the conpany, at three extraordinary general meetings. The deed of settlement clid not authorize the directors or managing officer to sell or dispose of the buslness of the comepany. The deed of settlement did not give the power of carrying on any other insurnnce than xarine nxurances, and subsequently the Sea Insurance Companywas started under the auspices of the Port of London Cnmpany for the purpose of embracing the business of fire and life assurance in addition to marine assurance. In 1849 the manager and chairman of the Portof London Company delivered Instructions to the solicitor of the company to prepare a deed for the purpose of amalgamating the two companies, and busneas was carried on under that deed until May, 1850, when the offices were closed, and on the 8th of June following an order was made for winding them up. It happened that the Sea Company by their deed had ndertaken to keep thePort of London Company harmless, and when their aEairs came to bo wonnd up the Waster allowed a sum of 5,8561. as a debt to the Port of London Company from the Sea Company. The Sea Company sppaled from this decision to Master Tinney, alleging that at the time of the amalgamation the Port of London Company was insolvent, and that tbey had no power to sell or dispose of their bustness. Master Tsnney allowed the appeal, but the Lords Justlces subsequently reversed Master Tinney's decision, and an appeal was now made from the judgment of the Lords Justices. Ho (the lord Chancellor) was of opinion that the directors and managers of the Port of London had exceeded their powers in amalgamating the two companies, and that Therefore the shareholders of the Sea Company were not hound to indemnify the Port of London Company, T'he decision of the Court below reversed accordingly. SMITH V. OSBORNE. Their LonDSmPS delivered judgment in this appeal from the decision of the lord Chancellor of Ireland. The LOID CRANCELLOR, in giving his opinion in this case, said the question wag whether the widow of Mr. Osbornecould claim to have certain propertyupon which her marriage settlement had aeoured her 5001. per annum, made liable to that annuity when the interest her husband took in it was different from that which he contemplated taking at the time he executed the settlement, and when the interest contemplted in the settlement never accrued. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland had decided that the trustees were bound in equity to execute the covenant for bringing thisproperty under the settlement, and thus secure the nCOl, annuity to MIrs. 0sborne. He (the Lord Chancellor) was of opinion that writh regard to the lands in question the decision of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland was right, hut wiith regard to certain houses which came to Mr. Osborne by a separate source the decision of the Chancellor of Ireland was wrong, and that the matter must he remitted with a declaration of the cpinion of their Lordahips. The matter remitted accordingly. TBE SOUTH*EASTERN RAILWAY COrPmiAy V. JORTIN. In this appeal the Lords Justices had ordered the appelIants to pay the respondent a rum of 1,500. due to him upon mortgages of the harbour of Folkestone to several persons now represented by the respondent before the purchase of the property by the appellants from the Exchequer Loan Commissioners. The Act of the 47th of George 111. gave the Folkestone Harbour Company power to borrow money upon mortgage of the tolls and dues of the harbour. Under this Act the company borrowed L50vL from various per. Eons who had since transferred their mortgages to the respondent. They subbequently borrowed a further sum of 10,0001. from the Exchequer Loan Commissioners, who, after taking ponsession of the property, sold it to the appellants. In 1848 a bill was filed by the respondent to enforce the payment of the mortgage, and the appellants denied their liability on the ground that the Excbequer Loan Commissionera had power to sell the property clear from all encumbrances, and also on the ground that the respondent's remedy, if any, was against the commissioners, and not against the ralway company. The Lords Justioes had decided in favour of the respondent. Their Lordships, in delivering the judgment of the Honse, reversed the decision of the Court below, on the ground that when a mortgagee sold under proper powers he de. feated the claims of all other ntortgagees,whose remedy was against tie money in the hands of the vendor. They conaidered that the company had properly purchased the pro. perty from the commissioners, who were liable to the respondent for the surplus of the amount received by the sal4 of the property,after deducting the amount due to them for principal and interest. Appeal allowed accordingly.
RIOT 0 PAISLEYRACECOURsR.-On Friday night, immediately upon the close of the racing proceedings, one of the most disgraceful riots, accompanied by bloodshed anl we fear death, took place on the racing ground at Paisley. Various statements havo been made as to the origin -ofthe -quarrel; by some it is attributed to a dispute between the navvies engaged in theneighbourhood of John& ston and the miners, upon what is usually understood to be "part principle," but, so far as we wera able to juadgo, theorrible proceedings whichwe have to narrate occurred simply from a desire, premeditated, to have a row on the easiest pretence. In the courso of the day s number of minerawas observed to congregate in thewest end of the Park, and it would appear that their potations were large, and their conduct misnhievous. In the exercise of his duty one of the policemen thought fit to take an ill-looking Iriehman into custody. He had no sooner done so than he was knocked upon to head witb a bludgeon by one of the culprit's companions, fasled to tne ground, ad so seriously abused as to eavse, as iS reported, almost instantaneous death. The byEtanders followed in pursuit of the miscreant, and caught him. He was dragged to the weigbing booth and there handcuffed, and afterwards removed to Paisley prison. During the remainder of the sport there were occasional stand-up fights in the west end of the Park, zot up, no doubt, by the navvies, and on each ocson in endeavotring to suppress disorder the police were very severely handled. The racing was fimshed about 6 o'clock, and the company, numerous during tbe day, was gradually moving off, when this motley band of miners, numbering, we should suppose, about 150, and armed with stobs, essayed from the west end of the course in a halanx Indiscriminately attacking all and sundry, men and women, on their way to the grand stand. The scene was traly frightful to witneEs; the bludgeons were used with a freedom which Indicated instant death, and the cowardly ruffians, not content with levelling a man who had done them no injury, gathered around him in knots, and kicked and smashed at their prostrated fellow-creature till they left him, as they supposed, for dead. We witnessed at least a dozen instances of this barbarity, and after the mniscreants had left the ground, carrying their bludgeons over their shoulders In triumph, we had the pAinful spectacle presented to us of many decent men having their wounds bandaged in the tents by medical men brought from Paisley. So disgraceful were the proceedings of the rioters1 a number of gentlemen gathered themsel7es togetber, as lf it were by common consent, and with sticks and stobs made a charge upon the ruffians, but, as a matter of course, they were not organ,ized; three of the gentlemen in front fell before the onslaught of their opponents, and the others, terrified, rushed to the rear, followed by stones and brickbats from all directions. At this tiD-e there was a call that the military were coming, and the rioters gathered themselves together in the most orderly manner, and walked offi When the riot began, wby we do not know, the police, such as they were, were walked off the ground,and butfor thealarmof the approachofthe miitary,whichturned out to be altogether a ruse, it is difficult to tell what might have been the result of this extraordinary outrage. As it is, we bave one man reported killed, another we witnessed in the agonies of death, and at least a dozen more, if they live, disfigured for the term of their existence. We are loth upon al occasions to attach blame to anybody, but we cannot help saying, upon this occasion, that it appears strange mhen a riot apparently foruodable had taken place the pole should have been muastered and wvalked off the course, and for at least an hour such horrifying acts should have been allowed to be perpetrated within half a mile of the principal office of the BRenfrewebire sathorities. TH !ItnUiE AT FurarORE.-AniOng the nu merous examples of heroism of which bvery mail from India now brings us an account few are more striking than that given by Ihr. Robert Tucker, the late judge of Putteypore. Actuated by a chivalrous sense of duty, he remained at his station when all other Europeans had quitted it, and by giving and promising rewarda to such native officers as should serve faithfully, and himself fearlesslv riding about the city wherever danger appeared or he tbought that his presence might be useul, he endeavoured, but in vain, to stem the tide of insurrection. When the gaol had been broken open and the treasury Dlundered Mr. Robert T-acker made hislast stand, single-handed, on the top of the cutchery, and many of his assaulants fell before his fire before he himself sank under a volley from the rebels. He was one of the most generous and high-minded of the Company's servants. It had been his customn for yfears personall to adinAtister to the wants of the poor natives-the sickA, the blind, and the leper ; and many of those who were fed by his bounty will have cause to mounrs him who has died the death of a hero, animated by the firm courage of a Christian [Advertisement.]-India.-A coloured map of India will be presented ratte with the '"Dlsrateh" of Sunday sext, Augast 23.

P-RO.POSUD ACCELEB4TIOW OF TEH MMzL To. THB NOBTH OP BUROPZ. (From the 1.rad;ord Observer.) Tho exports from Great Britain to the North of Europe are larger than to any other country in the world, exoept the United Slates. Of this trade a very large proportion belongs to the majufaoutifgr dishiots of Yorkshire and Lnar-aehire; and wein Braforil are more deeply interested in it then perhaps any other 'o,vn in the West Riding. Of course, wherever tlere is a large trade it is most imnportant to maintain a rapid, easy, and cheap, channel for thLe transmiasion of correspondente and goods between the plces interested in it. Strang, however, to say, that at the very threshold of the buslnct a our Pout-office autLorities interpowc a most serious and prejudicial olbtruction. It will scaroely be believed that the letters from Bradford to the Worth of Europe lie for .16 hours in the London Pohrtoffice before they are despatchcd. Yet such is the fact; they leave Bradford at 9p.m., reach London at 4 30 a.i., but are not despatched from London till 8 30 p.m. The only rational expland ation of this ouemdty is, that the Post-offhce people were acng thought- I lessly, unconscious of the mtiheief they were doing to the omercanile people; and, therefore, that all that was neceaFaryto be done wih to h eeent the case to the authorities, when ithwould be prompostoy and offectually remedied, Sbc,h bowever,s i not the truexplanation. The Post-office people have beer quite iware of the facts and inconvenience, for our Chamber of Commerce have aeen fortwo years bombrd. ing them with information and e ar renpt and remtno strances, blt In vain. Asp. iRowland ill r aat repmeled the atter,k by the ai, inedrticr of office, and the evil continues unabated to this day. And the remonstrance has not only come from Braeford. The whole of the orth of rEndgland suffer" by the detention of the mail, and the Chambers of commerce in Maucheester and Liverpool have oneeard again expostnlated with the Post-office authorities upon the absuirdity of sllowing such a grievancoe to continue. At length it was proposed to unite the forces of the Chambers in one combined attack upon the Post-office, and a pre liminary meeting wts held In Mnohester on the st of August to make arrangements. Mr. Bazley, on behalf of the Manchester Chamber, presided over ameeting at w1bichitwas resolved to aendahr. ge andinfluentiAl deputation to St. Martin's-le-Grand. W r. Aapinall Tutrer, then ember for Manchester, obtained anappointment for a interview which took place on Friday lAst; and we think we may say that a more influential deputation has seldom presented itself to the Government. We believe that all. the Lanclhire and Yorkshire Chamabers of Commerce were represented. The Chambers of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Huddersfield, Bradford, Sheffield and Hlull were severally represented by Mr. Busbeli, Mfr.

What can be mnore absurd than a system which enables a correspondent at Rlberfeld to send a letter which is delivered in Bradford 33 hoonr after it is posted, whereas 60 hours elapse after the reply to that letter is posted before it reaches its destination ? All the deputation ask is to have trains with bags des"tched about neon, travelling at I sufficient speed to arrive in time to insure the letters being forwarded froma London at 8 30 p.mn., thus raving a6 delay which at present amounts in many canes to 24 hours. We are sure the matter will not rest, and if the authorities of St. IMartin's-le-Grand do not make immediate arrnwgements other mneans will he adopted to insure success.

LA&rD Saip ox1 T SOurK YOxKSHmn RAILWAY. -Owing, no doubt, to thelAte excessive rTins, an immense nass of rock, consisting of earth and stones, fell in the deep cutting near Warmaworth, on the South Yorkshirei aiWsy, on Saturday night. The excavation at this pbrLt is boutltO0 feet deep, chiefly through solid limestone, and large beams oftimb'er wre placed across the gnullet atinterval3 to trengthen it. Shortly before 9 o'clock on Saturdi; night a goods train passed through the cutting, and almost immne diately afterwards one of tne crossbeama was heard to crack, and a tremendous fall of rock succeeded. The greater per. tion of the material dropped into the large stone quaziles at the end of the cutting, but sificient fell on thelineto comFletely block it up, and fortutately a person eugaed On the ine witnessed the accident in time to stop an approachln pasEenger train from Sheffield and Barnsley, the i:niatee of which were conveyed back to the Conisborough station and forwarded thence to Doncaster by road. An adequae staff of workmen was at once despatched to the acene of the accident, and rzlays of labourers were kept coritnsnlly employed in clearing the line up to Sunday night, wheb, jut as the work ws completed, a ballaat eogine wis thrown across the line at the points at Hexthorpe and blocked both paira of rails, so that the passenger train from ShefMisid, due at Doncaster at a quarterro 8 o'clock, had to be stdpped and the passenger transierred to a fresh train ummroried from Doncaater. The line was again in work yesterday (XMon. day), but a large proecting point of rock left unsupported by the ip n tne cutting bangs over the face of the cliff at Warmxnworth in a very dangerons position.

On the homeward voyage the Magdalena experienced fine weather, with light breezes. The yellow fever had considerably abated, and there were very few cases during the stay of the blagdalena at St. Thomas's, which she left at 2 p.m. on the 1st inst. She had eight cases of fever on the homeward voyage, three of which terminated fatally. On the 29th ult. an exteDsive fire broke out on a wharf at St. Thomas's commonly known as Stubbs's wharf, and owing to the quantity of coals deporited there it very quickly assumed a serious aspect; but from the prompt attention of the crews of the Royal MIail Company's steamers Magdalcna and Solent, aided by the engines of the company, the larger range of buildings was, after considerable exertion, saved. Thecoals still continued smouldering when the Magdalena left. HerMajesty's ships Imaum, Perseverance, and Arachne were at Jamaica; the Tatar at Colon; the BrilHant at Grenada; and the Termagant at Havannah. The United Ststes' frigate Saratoga was at Greytown, receiving Filibusters. Our usual files of papers and letters from Jamaica have not reached us by this steamer. Advices from Demerara are to the 25th ult. Governor Wodehouse had left for England on leave of absence, and was expected to return to the colony in about six months. The Hon. Wiiliam Walker had been appointed Lieutenant-Governor, and wan to be sworn in on the afternoon of the 25th. The weather during the fortnight had been fine, with smart showers occasionally. The eanes were looking well, but manlufacturing operations were proceeding slowly on the estates. The exports for the fortnight amounted to-sugar, 1,749 hogsheads 47 tierces 423k barrels 55 bags; rum, 1,046 puncheons 167 hogsbeads 41 barrels; molasses, 369 puncheons 31 tierces 1.6 barrels 30 casks; titnber, 15,791 cubic feet; cocoanuta, 31,200; charcoal, tl boarrels; plantains, 600 bunches; annatto, 50 casks; cotton, 120 bales; flour, 200 barrels; corn meal, 1701b. A company was being formed at Georgetown for the purpose of opening a road to the new gold d3iggings and prospecting in the interior. In the Court of Policy the Governor, in reply to a question of Dr. Blair, made the following statement in reference to the gold discoveries :-The prin. cipal questionto be determined, beforeanyactual steps couldbe taken inthis matter, woald beas to the exact position of the boundary between the British possesions here and the Spanish State of Venezuela, andd with reference to that question on the 9th of June last he wrote to the Secretary of State to inform him that the reports of the discovery of gold in Venezuela were of considerable importance, and that it was likely they might be confirmd to a great extent; and therefore he urged upon the Home Governmbent the necemsity of furnishing the Government here, with the least possible delay, with positive instructions as to what wera the boundaries to be claimed between this territory and Venezuela, and at the same time what support Her Majesty's Government would be prepared to give in carrying out the decision they might come to. He aso,took the opportunity, looking at the probability of a road being formed into the interior, of asldng that the Government here should be furnished with all possible instructions and directions with respect to the rights of the Crown, the rights of the colony, and the rights of individuals, and generally with the power of making such arrangements as shouild be most advantageous to the colony. As he had stated, that despatch went home on the 9th of June, and could only have reached England on the 2d of July. But as to the policy which the oolony ought to pursue his own opinion was that they should take advantage of the prestige which at. tached to the English name, and the security afforded by Englisbh institutions, to make this place, if possible, a depot for the diggings, whether they were in our territory or in the Spanish territory. They ought to do aU they could by joint action of the Governmeent here and the Home Government to encourage enterprising people to come here on their way to the diggings, and to afford them safety in taking, the gold awray. They should endeavour, as far as their meaans went, to establish posts along -the line, and means of conveyance from here to :i4aw.aroony, or wherever was the nearest point from the diggings, and satisfy parties that as soon as their gold was brought across our boundary, or within our territory, it might be considered to be in perfect security.'He thought if they did that they would probably attract to this place an enormous influx of people; and he be. lieved every class of the population would benefit. He did not think it would by any means folow that the planters would sustain any injury from such a course of proceeding, as in all probability a number of the persons that would come would settle down not only at the gold diggings, but to other pursuits from which all would profit. He would therefore be glad to see the colony, when the time came, making every effort to secure all the advantages of this discovery, which he thought would prove a very fortunate one. At Barbadoes there was not much to notice. The health of the island continued good. From Grenada we have news to the 25th nlt. A ,day of general thanksgiving for a plentiful harvest, absence of disease, and other "great mercies vouchWafed to the colony," had been appointed for the following day (Sunday) by proclamation of the lieutenant-Governor. The plantations over the entire isLand presented a most promising aspect, and the appearance of the whole country was most encouraging. From the other islands there is no newe of imlportance.

The last bank returns show a marked falling off in circulation, thec difference being no less than 148,0001. against 47,0001. in the same month of 1856. The aggregate amount, however, is about 300,0001. in excess of the amo'nnt of 1856, and 800,0001 greater than at this time in 1855. The bullion has declined in the month 45,0001., and is now only about 120,0001. greater than at the corresponding period last year. The diminution on the month extends to all the banks, with the exception of the Provincial, which has increased its issues by 5,0001. The banks in which there has been a diminution of specie are the National andUlster Banks, and the Bank of Ireland. In the Provincial, Belfast, and Northern Banks there has been an increase. The following figures wil show the position of. the banks in the aggregate now and at the same period of the two nrecedina vr* - From the foregoin returns it follows that the Irish banks are now 79,2111. above their fixed issue, but, taking into account the coin they hold, the amount is 2,184,9601. below that allowed by law. THE HMY0OY OF DAHI1X O'CONNrL. The Limerick papers of Saturday give accounts of the inauguration of the O'Connell statue, which took place on that day. The affair is said to have been quite a suo-ew. There were bands, and oanners, and processions to no end and all went smooth, if not merry. The Earl of )unraven pronounced the eulogy of the late Liberator. His Lordship, who has recently embraced the Roman Catholic faith, after giving a sketch of all the agitations of which Mr. 0'Connell had been the alpha and omega, proceeded to say- "In looJdnat tho caims which the great liberator has upon us,I am DarticuLarly impressed with the claims he has upon my respect and gratitude, as well as the respect and gratitude of the thousauds who are members of the relHgion whic he professed and sustained t eers.) Sprang as he was nd aeIar proud to e, th andent ish races his family rever deserted the faith that has exsed hare since the coming of St. Patrick (cheers), while one of my ancestors, I regret to say, was base enough, under the pressure of the penal laws to apostatize. (Cheers.) But I have had the blessed privilge -t.he gretest privilege which God can give to mxan, situated as was, to be restored to that ancient church, which hu been so long the church of this people and this country. (Loud and continued cheering.) It i5 not only as a muember of that church, bat also as a lover of liberty, that we owe the deepest gratitude to the Liberator." There ig really some show of justice in the continued demands of the Cork Constitution for further inquiry into the allegations preferred against Spollen s wife by Mr. Curran in the course of his able defence of the prisoner. Following up its recent remarks upon this braneh of the cae, the Cork paper asks,- " Is a woman publicly impeached of having attempted to procure the execution of her husband to remain at large? Is there to be no trial, no inquiry, no investigation of the grounds on which the accusation ws preferred? If the At. torneY-General sleeps shbll the press seep? Are our Dublin contemPoraies to suffer the startling statement of Mr. Curran to be forgotten ? Is it not better worth their attention than were the host of 'rumours! on which they expended so much sPeculation ? Then why are they silent ? Thero is a clue to the murder. Either Spollen was the mnrderer, or Mrs. Spollen knows who wss There is no escaping that dilemma. How without knowledge of the murderer could she kave told where the plunder waa deposited I Eow could her statements to the police have been verified and their search for it have been succesful? How, moreover, did SpoUen's raxor get Into the canal? We put these questions merely to show that if Spollen is innocent M Spoilen has a secret in her possesion which ought not to be left there, and that if he is not Innocent she ought not to be made the victim of the foulest calumny ever uattered against a mother and a wife. No license can excuse no exigency can iustify it. Either it is true, and she is worse, more heartless, more hardened, more infamous than the shedder of Mr. Little's blood; or it is false, and -but we mnst not trust ourselves with the inference. Be itwhich it may, it is the duty of the law ofiicers to search it not, and the duty of the press to keep them to it. Wherever the accusation is believed that woman stands ina nwore undesirale position than Bpollen stood in before he was arraigned; aud ought this tohbe so and shestill at large tIs that the result we look for from legal process i superior courts? Is one to be acquitted that another, unoonvicted and unquestiioned, mazy be condemned 2"
ACCELERATrOZ OF THE KDrAN MA.fILs, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Since I addressed you In March on the subject of the Indian malls, one of the absurdities then complained of has been extinguished. The packet, in place of remaining in Bombay harbour from dark till daybreak, delaying the ails by 12 hours at the starting point, now leaves at snn. set, when the Post-office closes, as vwa its wont from 1838 till 1854. The other anomalies of which I then complained remain as before, and that, too, at a time when deapateh has become doably important. For the past three months postal arrangements have been distarbed by the south-wet monsoon. Now that fine weather has once more set in the faultiness of the system will become apparent, and we shall again, as we already have had, our outward and inward mails crossing each other at Dover, or London-bridge, or St. Martin's-le-Grand. At present the mails leave Bombay on the 2d and 16th of every month, and London on the 10th and 26th, and occupy from 24 to 26 days in trasit, ar. riving ti both ends of the line within a few daye or hours of the outgoing despatch Were the despatcbes at both ends made on the 1st and 15th arrivals would occur about the 25th and 8th, leaving a 'week for reply, and saving a fortnight ou return of post, without anychange whateverre. quiring to be made in the existing carrying rrangements Surely an alteration so simple as this is not so Herculean a task as to be too much for an Administration which takes so lghtly the reconquest of Bengal and reorganization of an empire. At present the mails occupy above 30 hours in crossing the desert on the backs of camels, 86 miles, while the pas. aengers traverse the same distance in 16. The railway brings the whole from Cairo to Alexandria in six hours. Why should not the Marseilles portion of the mail cross as quicldy as the passengers, and be sent off from Alexandria the moment it aridves? By this a saving of 14 hours at least would be effected. Six months hence the railway wil be opened all through Egypt, when mails and passengers will come together from Suez to Alexandria, 216 miles, in eight hour in place of 40, as at present; then the Valetta and the Vectis, the only two steamers at present on the arseilles line, will be found utterly inadequate for the -work, and the malls, which already require to wait 10 or 20 hours at Alexandria for a steamer to bring them on, must be detained 48 hours at least. It has been lately suggested by a very distinguished authority that two or three light steamers should be detached fromthe fleetat Mata, and keptwith steamnup ibthe harbour of Alexandria to take on despatches, prepared induplicateor triplicate, for disributioi to the nearest point, leaving the general mals to be brought up as at present. Were it found that these vessels coild not carry coal enough for the whole voyage they might be rranged in relays, and by this at least 24 hours might be saved. From Alexandria to Marseites by MaltaIs 1,860miles; by the Straits of Messinaitis 1,800. Wy not let an extra steamer try the shorterroute?

What has become of them ? The wire has long been at work from Suez to Alexandria. It requires but to be pompleted by either of the lines just named to give us tidings from India in 13 days in place of 22, as at present. I have suggestedhat the Marseiles portion of the mails should come by van in 16 hours across the Desert. As there are horsing stations every six miles, a courier might bring the Government and the newspaper despatches, with half a score newspapers, in six hours, and have them on the Mediterranean within 12 hours of their quitting the Red Sea. Why not send off one express steamer with the telegraph message, another ten hours after with the despatches, leaving the mais to foilow as they beat could t WhAt would the British public not at this moment give to receive news from Idia a weok earlier than at present ? Though the mutiny is by this time, I trust, entirely extinguished, India must be a source of intense anxiety to us for years to come. Why not push on the laying down of a line of telegaph by the Rd Sea Cwithout one moment's delay, and at whatever chare ? The Euphrates Valley line, the projectore asure us, wilI not be ready for three years to come and we must have one line open within the next 10 months It will be time enough to think of the wecond line when the world isprepared to pay 40 a-ton for the transit of goods betreen ndia and Europe by the Euphrates Rail. way, or 201& by the Suez Canal, the very lowest price of ateam canrage by land or water from India to England where nothing but steam will suffice, when the Cape route is accesble for 40s. The assurance that maU 0 assnger transit by the E:npbratee lLine will three years hence be accomrplishablo in 22 days, even should a dream so wild be realized, is small comftort when we feel certain that within the next siX months the Red Sea route may be shortened wvithout difficulty to 21, Your obedient serv,ant.

SUBMARINE TBLEG.RAH. TO THE EDITOER OF THE TIMS. Sir,-Can you spare a space in your columns for a Practcal suggestion ? While Lord Ellenborough is exhibiting himtelf, night aftermight, asbeing by inplication the highest authority on military matters; while Mr. Disraeli is sneering at Lord Dalhousie under the comfortable conviction that Lord Dalhousie's atate of healthprevents hinifromundertakdng any defence, or fromad%ilnistering any castigation; and while Sir Charles Napier's clever but somewhat irascible opinions are quoted as oracles, and every other Napier holds himself in readiness to hurl any amount of vituperation against the unfortunate sceptic who may venture to doubt whether Sir Charles's dicta were always consistent, or urged in such a manner as to effect a practical good, I would venture to ask whether the country is more interested in the question of Lord Ellenborough's self-laudation, or Mr. Disraeli's political importance, or Sir Charles Napier's personal merits, than in bringing all its energies to bear practically on the present emergency, and in directing their application to facilitating the task we have in hand. Your correspondent at Hongkong, in his admirable letter in your paper of to-day, pointedly alludes to the subject of rapid communication. Can any one doubt its value at such a moment? It is almost impossible to overrate it. The determination which, tak en a few weekes earlier, might have saved an incalculable amount of life or expenditure may be rendered fruitess by the delay which under ordinary circumstances could not be avoided. At this very moment there is an opportunity for effecting the object which almost seems providenti&l. The magnificent project for connecting the Old World with the New sfeems destined for a time, and I hope only for a time, to remain in abeyance. During the approaching autunnal gales it will hardly be possible to lay the line across the Atlantic; but the line is perfect and ready for use. Why should not the Government at once purchase it, and connect Alexandria with Malta by telegraph? I beUeve there is alo sufficient line gtill further to connect Adenwith Suez. Here is a work worthyof an intelligent and practical people. If thegreat Carthaginian (and a greater than Carthage is bre !) found a chymical agent for clearing the difficulties which opposed the advance of his army, why shall not we put into unmrediate operation that wonderful power upon whichthe safety and security not only of our army but of anl empire may depend ? Is it to be a question of costs? W hy, millions may be saved by the transnmisajon of one message e have the opportunityof doing it today; to-morrow it may be lost. I am not one of those who rail at redtapistdemeritsorGovernmenteircumlocution. Onthe contrary, I believe the service of the Government to be generally better performed than any other service. I am quite sure that if Government departments had been guUty of half the misdeeds Which have been perpetrated by almost every board of railway directors in the kingdom, to say nothing of joint-stock companies, the Thames would not be large enough to hold the drowning officials. If there is any one who would be likely at once to adopt such a suggestion aa I have made, it will be our indefatigable Premier. t I have the honour to be. N. IL London, Augu2 17.
ATLANTIcJ TBLEBRAPH CABLE. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-The late disater but realizes your own sagacious prediction of April last, when instituting a comparison between the cable then maldng and the submarine conductor proposed by Mr. Allan; but it is truly remarkable to find how that gentlemnan, long before thecable wFas even commenced, foretold what would happen. in the prospectus of Mr. Aflar,!s company, published at Christmas, the following words occur . "The ma y failures of the submarine cables hitherto con tructed are so notorious that it masy be safely predicted, 'It will be found impossible to conneot Europe with America by meansof submarine cables constructed on the principles of those now in use.' Their great weight (from two to six or eight tons per mile) re4ders the carriage of them difficult, and the laying of Uem almoet impos. sible without conatant risk to the integrity of the conductors For long distance they are deficient in condusting power, while from their peculiar conformation they are self-destractive on being submerged to great depths; moreover, their cost is enormous-from 2OOe. to 8001. per mnile. The cost of the cable now making for the Atlantic Telegraph Company is said to be only l2Og. per mile, and its weight about a ton; but the principles of its construction are the same as the abcove, and it i3 even much weak~er than any yet made."

On the evening of the 14th of August a,nother violent storm pased over this place, accompanied by much thunder and lightning and heavy rain.

At Oxton and north of Nottinghbam rain feU with great violence from 7 p.m. till near midnight, greatly increasing the floods.
THE LATE STO S.-NomTInGnAx, Monday.- The waters are receding to-day. The flood has been a very large one for the time of the year, ard a great deal of danage has been done.

Of course, the grain of thesa is great damaged. In the Trent vale great loss wll be sustained, and in several districtg along the river wheat and other corn has been under water.

ALWAY 1NTELUGLENCE. GRELT LtBXEMBOrRa- .. neral meeting of the sareholders in this company was ield yesterday at the London TAvern, prepsratory to ennual meetng at Brussels; the Ron. F. Scott in the 21r. COXHLD, the secretary, read the report, which xtated that at the da- eof the Las report the portion of the line open, 34i miles, was from the company's own station at Bruels to Namur. On the 3d of November, 1856, an Important link, four mUes in length, was added, connecting the company's line at Brussels with the State line on the north aide of the city. The cost of the four mile had not exoeded 42,0001. By means of thi junction a direct through railway communication was effected between the Great Luxembourg line and Rotterdam and the whole kindom of Holland, As well as Ostend, Antwerp, oad ia port and places in the north of Belgium. The receipts on capital account durin the past pear amonted to 287,5511. and the expen itire to 3l4,959 leaving a differenoe of 27,4081., being the lamount expendeA beyond the receipts of the year. With reference to the Grand Junction lines the sut against Sir W. Kagnay which the board Wad felt it their daty to institute remains yet to be heard. The gross receipts of the railway for the past year amounted to 32,0721., and after deducting the working expenses the net profits amount to 16,4581. This sum, as weu as the profit on working the canal, has been applied towards the payment of the interest of the obligation debt. The line from Brussels to Namur was opened for traffic in the mniddle of April, 1856, and a compuison of the weekly receipts show, that from the 13th of April to the 13th of July, 1856, the receipto amounted to 7,8921., but for I the corresponding period of the present year they amounted to 12,4671. About 1.6151. of the increase hax arisen from the opening of the four miles of junction line. The earn. iDgs of the &e will also be increased I the opening of the rauwvy from Namur to Arlon, and ito the frontiers of Franoe and Germany. ArrangerDents for the constraction of the railways from the Belgian frontiers to the city of Luxembourg and thence to Treves and Thionville, and from Treves to S"rbruck. All these works are in course of actual execution. The French Government has just made a treaty with the Ardennes Rilway Company to extend their line from Sedan to Tbionville, with a branch to Longwy, near Arlon. The first section of the line from I Namur to Arlon will be openedadistance of 18 miles by the end of the preent year, and will be entitled to 4 per cent, interest from theend of 1857, and in like manner the whole line 83' mile will be ready for traffic, and bo entitled to clim the like interest from the 1st of August, 1858 or in lees than a year from the present time The entire line from Brussels to Arlon will be completed at the period mentioned in former reports, and the eost wilt not exceed the sum formerly predicted. In order to do this, however, the neceary funds must be sapplied. It is proposed to issue, at 3. each, 125,000 obU tions of 41.ewch,besring 5 peroent. interest andreimb=2sable I at 1. each by annual drawings The shareholders will be en- titledtooneoond and a-quarter for each share theynowhold. The interest wonld thus be at the rate of 6i per cent,, besides the premium on reimbursement, the directors in conclusion earnestly. invitS the shareholders to effect a speedy completion of an undertaking which, in spite of previous adverse circumstarces, will still become a valuable property. The capital acoount shows that 186660 was received and expended. The CAiRmAr, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the members of the present board, since they had taken offiee, had had nothing to unsay and nothing to undo. What they had amserted at the outset had been Tenfied to the present time, and he had no doubt of the same | result being continned to the completion of the underI taingDanc of their shares holding their legitimate plaoe in the money-market. They had a good material undertakinz and a wonderfully increasing one as to its traffic. He coula not account for their position in the money-market, for when they had 101. paid their shares were at 71.; but nowtbat the 201 per share was paid in fullthey were no more than 71 in the market. When they took office only 9 mrles out of 124 miles were open for traffic, and those 9 miles were worked at a dead loFS The receipts were 101. per mile per week, and the expenses were 20. per mile wer week. In the early part of 1856 the receipts inreased to 171 13s per mile, nd the expenditure had been dimi- nished. Ata later period of last year the receipts had increased to 201 12s. per mile, and the expendciture ws less than 50 per cent. He would leave them to judge whether there was any cause for the depreciation of their shares. When they came into office 80 miles out of 124 miles of line remained untouched, and hael the capital had been expended; there remained only the other half of the capital to construct and finish three. fourths of the whole work. They had so many promises made to them by the former board that the shareholders did not believe the statement that three-fourths of the Work could be completed by the out'ay of half the cap it.L They did not ask them for one sixpece more I tbaataey hadtold them they would want. (Hear, bear.) I The coost of their line would be about 20,0001. per mile, not- withstanding all the extravagance, althoughit was about twioe as much as it ought to have cost. If they would have patience nd complete the line there would be a fair return on the outlay. The junction line at Bruss four miles in length had been constructed at a cost of 10400L. a-mile, notwithstanding that it poassed through ibvam Ule property They had received considerable adsstanoeand nuformation from Mr. B. Reed, their resident director, and from what he had ascertained as to the cost of their ne and the probable traffic upon it, there was no canse for depreciation or despondency. The present trffic on the lne averaged about 1,0001. a-week, and he found, on comparing it with that of 10 Belgian lines, that it stood second on the list. The receipts on the Luxembourg line averaged 61£ per day per kdlometre after being opened for 12 months, while the State lines had taklen 10 years to arrive at that receipt, and they were now paying above 6 per cent, on their cost It was the intention of the directors to complete the line with the greatest rapidity. He could promise that one-third of the remainig portion of the railway would be finiahed in a few months more, that one-half would be completed by next spring, and the remaining half in the summer of 1858, by which time the whole would be open for traffioe. They would thenoeforward be entitled to the guarantee of 32,0001. a-year from the Belgian Government. They would have 26,0001. a-year from tbe portions now opened, making to gether 58,00N a-year to meet the preference charges, which amount would be more than ample for that purpoe. They mnst have money to oomplete the railway. The board had kept within their estimate, and he hoped the proprietors would sanction the measure proposed for raising the money, as it was the best means they could devise. t r. W.IREED seconded the motion for the adoption of the report. A lon dimcession ensupi uas to the best mode of raising the funs "ired to finisa the line, in which Mr. Beloe, on the part eEtae Liverpool shareholders, made some sugges- ns, as did also other proprietors; but, afer explanaitions from Mr. Reed, lr. Hutchinson, and Hr. Close, the discussionresultedt in the approval of the financial plan proposed The report was then unanimoaly adopted, and a resolution was passedrecommending the meetingat Brassels to approve the accounts as printed, reserving the items oonnected with the Grand Junction scheme. The CuAnm&r then read a formal resolution authorizing the directors to issue125,000 bonds or obligations of 41 each, at 31 each, and to offer them rateably to the propietors in the first instance, who should have the option of akig their proportion prior to the 10th of September next, the amount being psyable in instaiments of 1t. each. The resolution was carred unanimously, and a vote of thanks to the chairman ad directors for their exertions in promoting the interests of the company concluded the proceedings. LONDONT, TlLBURY, AND SOUTHrBD. The half-yearly meeting of this comDany was held y esterday at the London Tavern, Mr. Danlef in the chair. , Kennel,the secretary, read the report, whichsaited that, although the receipta for the past half-year appeared at first sig ht to be less than those of the correspond. ing period In 1856, the fact was not so, as there hd een an increase in favour of the past half-year of 2,0571. The fact of the apparent discrepancy arose from the circumstanoe that when the accounts were made up the oompany was found to be entitled to a portion of the sum of 9,000. carried to a suspense accoun' between the Eastern Counties and Blackwall.companies. The actnal traffio receipts for the half-year ended the 30th of June, 1856, amounted to 20,0241., and those of the hall-year ended the 30th of June, 1857, to 22,0814, being an increase of 2,057I. The expenditure ia the half-yearended the 30th of June, 1856, was 16,681L, aginst 13,9741. in the past half-year, bein2 a decrease of 2,6071L The extension line from Bow to Barking would be opened early 1in the ensuing year, the whole of the land, with the eOxceehptioOn of a very small portion, being in the possession of the contractors.~wih th The statement of accounts showed that the revenue from passenger, gods, wc, was 22,0811., and the expenditue 13,97b, leavnng abalanceof 8,1071. The expenditure of capital in repct of the Tilbury and Southend line amounted to 592,816&, and the recepts to 594,4781., leaving a balance of 1,6621 The pqyments on account of the branch from Bow to Barkdng were 126,885., and theoreceipts 131,788L, leaving a balance of 4, P021. The CaAOArN moved that the report, together with the statement of accounts, be received, approved, and Adopted. A 8!xERHOLDR} inquired what proportion the receipts from the line bore to the expenditure, as, although a dividend of 6 per cent. was guaranteed to the shareholders, the agreement would expire by the efflux of time, and the proprietors would consequently like to know what would be the Ultimate value of their property, The CnA 3. replied that tho receipts for the last hailyear (theworst portion of the year) were sufficient to pay a di=dend of 1 per cent, upon the capital of the company, but that the dividend for the whole year would amount to 4 per cent., after paying the intrest on the debenture dlebt. Another SHARXuoLDRB s5aid that the shares with a gu. ranteeof 6 per cent., which ought to be worth 36 premium, were at 2 discount, and in uired what security the company held that the interest would continue to be paid.

The report stated that the amount received on capitl account to the 30th of June was 86,4741., and the amoblmt expended 85,8221. The directors believe that the tobal expenditure on this head for the present purposes of the main line is now very nearly ascertained. The returns of traffic furnished by the South-asternRailway Conmpany showed that 2,118, had been received for Fi months ending June ls. Considering the Progressive increase of the recoip., and that much of the traffio thAt Wkould naturll flow ovea the line stil finds its way to London by other inodes of eouveysice and that i he objectg of the undertarn 'butially attained until the openlnq of theline to B mker ;ad Norwo_d, now in Course Of 'Active constCucton, the resulte of the hlWf. yoreas workdng maLy be regre s norgng.

SzoxR=ARty read tho report, which stated that the trafficoon theline had materially increasedI sinoetbelaat report, the weekly traffic being mow doubl what It was this time last yeaLr, and th is ncrease ha taken place notwithstandcing the low fares between London end Reading. As the accmmodation for goods traffic at all the satAions wag now complete a steady Incr&eae may stil be exceted; and should a raisactor arragemaent be msda. with the South-PEatern Railway Company so that the Reading traffic maay be carried at fair sad remunerative rates, te directors have every reason to look with satisfaction on the future propca ofthe company. The Bill for formning a juancton at Reading of the South. Eastern line with thle narrow gauge of the Great Wester Railway had received the Roya awent , so that the original intention will be carried out of ma)king the Stai.nes and Wokting line a part of a direct route from the north-west of England to the south aide of London at Nllne-Elmg and Waterloo stations. The -whole length of the junctiozn is one maile 69 chains Of this the Great Western will make at their own cosrt one mrb 60 chains, leaving nine chains to be made by this company. After deducting the amaount outstanding for interest on debentures there remains to the credit of the traffic account 1,9511. ; but this sum is liable to a deduction for toll over the South-EasternL Railway beweRaignWknlam hcptlmnaoe that 357,2931. ha been received and 379,7481. expended, leavlngllabilltiesoutstanding to the amount of 22.4551. The tralric account from the 4th of June 1.5, to the 30th of June, 1857, showed that 13,6971h ia been received and 7,6024 expended in workin , and 4,1444 interest on debentures, leaving a beance of¶,95U. The CHAnutaI in mnoving the adoption of the report said, it was not very agreeable when the state of the as. cunts would not admit of a dividend. They had been labouring under very considerable difficulties in conrequence of the comPetition for the Reading and London traffio. The South-Eastiern carried the traffic at so low a price that it was unremunerative. The Reading and Relgate line was originallyoonstructedfor the puarpose of conveyingtraffic from the north to Dover. but it was converted Into an opposition line to the Great Westemn from London to Reading, nan although pasengers were taken round about 30 imiles at a no. "'"IPrice thy wre carried 47miles for nothing. On opening the Wokinlgham line they thoughtit more respectable not to runinoppo=tion to the Great Wesgtern, but to endeavour to bring aout a settlemnent between the companies for a reasonable charge. The goods traffic was also conveyed at very low rates between London and Reading. It was, how. ever, expected that some adjustment of fares and rates would be arrived aLt, which would miake their line more remunertive. The junction line, when completed, would be a great advantage to all the companies interested. They were on friendly terms witha the Gret Western Company, and he had no doubt they would proceed wi'th their prtion of the junction line as soon as possible. They ha no fault to find with the South-Western Company for the WaY in which they worked their line, although it was probable that soeneipomntcul be introduced which would facilitate h rfi n nrae the speed over the South-Western lin and their line. A Proprietor complained that the result of the year's working did not surwihthprseus The traffic only amounted t .,04isedo 000. as estimated in te pospctus Thy wre tld hattheAscot traffic woud ralze ,004,bu tht ad otbeen realized.

Dain the ladt few days seveali meetings have been held alt Exinouth in referenoe to the construction of a line of railWAY from that town to Exeter. The worls have not ret been commenced.. It appears thata larg prtio Of the capitalhad been subwcrbe-d-upwrd of3,04btnot sufficient to rialce the lUne for cs. egtainwreentered into with Mr. BraneL, the engne>adM.Rto,a contractr, to construct the hune. Th ietr eotdto the shareholders that the line abusvnmis in extent, would coat upwards of9004,adtt they had obtained a leaem from th ohDen and Bristol and Exeter Companies for working the line, which they considered was a satisfactory one. The shareholders, however, c-onsidered that the estimate for niakig the line was extravagank, and that the lease was unsatisfactory; and they appointedsacomimittee of sharoholders The commuittee, after going through the details assert that the lines can be made for much less money than that stated by the directors. Additional capital has beeni subscribed with the view to make the line for cash, and thus effectually to carr out the economical suggestions of the committee of shareholders, who also recomrmended the rejection of the lease obtained by the directors from the South Devon and Bristol and Exeter Comrpanies, on the grud that much better terms ought and can be obtained. In the meantimie the South-Western Railway Company have stepped in between the parties, and in connexion with the Yeovil extension to Exeter hiave resolred to miake a line to the port of Topsham, which is half-way between Exeter and Exinouth. The ExmnouthL Company ALro therefore invited to make their'line to Topsham, which their present caital will, it is said, enable them to do. ThUe 'Matter 'wil come before the adourned meeting of the company on the 29th instant.
