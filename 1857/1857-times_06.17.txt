'2'7 B OUT'"R V STATE9 OF AMERICA. (!RO OUB OWN COR7 PONDM;T.) NORFOLK, VIRGINIA, MAY 27. What is now called the Tidewater District of Vir ginia, or the whole of the seaboard westward to where the rivers that rise in the chain of the Alleghbaniis cease to be navigable, includes the tract first settled, and celebrated, commercially and politically; for a century and a-half, as "' the Plantations" Though cottoD, ha since dethroned tobacco from its ancient supremacy as a product and an 'export, the name this region so long retained in history indicates the estimate in which " the weed" w72 held; there were other plants, but the tobaccofids alone were distinguished as "the Plantations." The district, so much of which has been Cropped and finally smoked into exhaustion, extends from this place northward to the Potomac, along the banks of the rivers James,York, audRappahannoclr, and westward inland to the point where the tidew are arrested. Tho country is level, or moderately hilly ; along the rivers still well cultivated, but with Spaces between them, and beyond the alluvial soil of a barren and ungrateful aspect. These are the cheap tracts, which it is supposed are capable of improvement. They evidently need it, and capital and guano may do much; but the experienced shake their heads in doubt as to the possibility of reviving them, believing they have done their best, having filled myriads of pipes, made many commercial fortunea, and built the greater part of Bristol during the process That port may be considered the deposit or residuum left after the consumption by fire of the staple product of the " Plantations during two centuries ;" it is well 'that the "C weed" has left something more than ,ashes on both sides of the Atlantic. Since the rise into pro3perity of so many other Statea of America, and the extension of the culture of the more useful article of cotton over new regions of the south, we can hardly form an idea of the important position this district once held, commercialy and politicaly. Immnediately after the tettlement took root it grew and exported, at once creating and supplying a new want; continuing to cultivate and grow wealthy by trade with England, while the only other English colonyon the continent, Massachusetts,was struggling for mere existence, fighting with famine and the Indians, on a coil that scarcely grew enough to support the settlers. Throughout the period of the Common. wealth, and long afterwards, " the Plantations" had an importance beyond that founded on their comInerce. In an age of political troubles and civil conflicts the successful party always requires a place of exile for its opponents, and, moreover always finds one; " the Plantations" were the English Cayenne, to which hundreds of obnoxious persons were swept out of s,ght; they were fields of adventure, also, whither the bold and restless flocked, as they do now to Australia anad California. From all these causes, and in a great degree from the connexion of the settlement with the career of Raleigh, though his attempt to colonize it was a miserable failure iu everything but giving it a name, Virginia became so mnixed up with our history that no other of the American States has ever acquired such a hold on the popular mind. It has gained no distinct idea of States like Tennessee or Miwsouri, or many others, now more populous than Virginia, though of so much more recent origin. At the present day the past importance of this region seems out of proportion to its extent. A belt of land on the coast about 200 miles long by 100 wide covers the whole area of the once famous "Plantations." It is not a very large part of the State of Virginia, with her existing boundaries, and it was a very small fraction indeed of the territory once included in them, supposing those old limits were ever accurately known. This smal belt of soil was once actually the whole of British America, and continued to be so till the New England settlements rose more slowly. Ten times the extent of territory are now added to the American Union every year withont exciting the least notice as anything extraordinary. Congress thinks nothing of voting as much land to a single railroad company, the company thinks nothing of taking it, and it strikes no one as remarkable. We have seen very recently two immense gold regions opened up to the world-we have, in {act, discovered the deposits of gold the dim hints of whose existence set the tide of adventure towards this continent; but those regions have hardly acquired the importance in our present annals which the tobacco plantations of Virginia held in the past. The commerce of the world is so gigantic in aU its proportions that no article, not even gold, can do 'much more than quietly take its place in the tables of imports and exports. Considering the past celebrity of this tobaccoproducing district, it is singular how little the wealth it must have created has done for the country itself. It has not peopled it; it has not created a town or city of any magnitude; and, descending the rivers, the banks show scarcely a village, and not many scattered dwellings. From Washington to the sea, and from Richmond down to this place, the Potomac and the James appear equally destitute of life. Passing from the north to the south is like the transition from the rapids to still water; the population of the south is not only more sparse, but it is more fixed to the soil. In the north every third man is going somuewhere with a carpet-bag; between any two points al kinds of conveyances, by land or by water, are always flaU to their extreme capacity and often beyond it. There is a perpetual rushing to and fro, by train and steamer, throughout the north and west; at tshis moment it is said the western trains cannot be made large enough to convey the stream of travel in that direction. But at Washington this rush ceases. The crowds who have business at the Federal capital, or make it, go no further, and the steps of the Capitol are like a breakwater, against which the human torrent dashes and is stayed. Southward everything is taken easier. The sudden decrease in the number of travellers is at once apparent, the change being far more perceptibla than anything in the aspect of the country. Those who do go travel more comfortably, and in less of a scramble. What the result may be in reference to the shareholders and their dividends is a matter in which the voyager feels only a remote interest. As it is a settled axiom here that the first shareholders in all the railroads were ruined long ago, perhaps their successors may be receiving a fair return on their actual investments. If they do, the northera lines ought to be making large profits, the difference in the amount of traffic being so decidedly in their favour. The southern trains, as a rule, run at less speed than those of the north; in which they do wisely, for the pace on the northern lines is too fast for the price, especially by night on roads neither watched nor fenced, or both done very imperfectly. Southern arrangements generally are less hurried; the people have more time; in the small towns some of them look as if they had almost too much of it, and a visitor without what are called "internal resources" would be very likely to feel the same sensation. Norfolk is the seaport of the State, about 10 hours' steaming down the James River from Richmond, the capital. It is from Norfolk that a line of steamers is contemplated to some port in France. This ocean line is part of the fature of Virginia; but it is impossible not to have misgivings as to the suecess of the speculation, considering that such a city as Philadelphia has just found it impracticable to support a similar enterprise, long established against the advanta2es of New York. ,iorfolk is a small, quiet place, wgrx .a_DpaOting and inland traffic that does not appear to tax the energien of the inhabitants very severely. The estuary of the river is spacious, end if easy communioation could be opened with the country beyrond the mounteing it might intercept some of the trade that goes to New Orleans by the Miissippi. At present the hhrbour has room for.any. amountofidcommerce tho chnnges of the next ten years may bring to it. The country round Norfolk is becoming the market. garden of New York; the warm aeason setting in, in average years (this savage winter is an exceptional one), earlier than onManhattan, the-New Yorker are supplied hence with new- potatoes, green peas, and strawberries, in anticipation of their own crops. At the rate of prices ruling in the northern metropolis the cultivators ought to be making fortunes. Some experiments on the quality of the herb that Ns once the staple produce of the State leaves a decided conviction either that the weed has degenerated or that the growers and preparers of it have lost their skill, or that the best sorts are made up for chewing. The list supposition appears the more probable, from the prevalence of the habit and all its consequences. But as a cigar the Virginian leaf is naught; the native article has a vile acrid flavour, resembling those patronized by Polish Jews on German railwaya, and which the Germans expressively call 'maoth destroyers." The only eigars at all atis. factory profess to be from Havannah, and are ax dear as In London, which in the Original hwbitat of tobacco is one of the many inconsistencies a traveller has to reconcile with preconceived ideas As prepared for the pipe the "real Virginia" is better, but stiU far from the standard, and if Sir Walter Raleigh's first esay had been no better than my last he would never have imported the habit. But, like everything of which the consumption has more than overtaken the prodaction, tobacco everywhere has become sophisticated. Refuse that a few years ago was used here for manure now commands a fair price and is in the market. A patent has been taken out at Washington for making tobacco by infusing the leaf of maize in a decoction of quassia and capsicum. It is said to be an excellent imitation of the genuine weed-quite equal perhaps to the British dock or cabbage. The leaf of the sunflover is also mantioned as a possible substitute for the real article. Another villany of the tobacco trade is to soak an inferior kind in a solk1tion of prussic acid, which produces an almond flavour, and loU of the use of the lower limbs in the smoker if he persists in consuming it after this warning. Altogether, from what is to be learned of the tobacco plant in this its native seat, it is impossible to regret that the fields have gone out of cultivation to such an extent, or are devoted to grain. Some sections of the vegetable kingdom evidently require a revival or renewal; for the scarcity or degeneracy in them opens a discouraging prospect. The potato, the vine, and tobacco are all damaged or deficient in quantity. Of the vine there are faint hopes in Australia and the vaUey of the Ohio; but no second Raleigh is likely to give the world a new herb that will be to it like the leaf he introduced from America, for our discoverers seem determined to look for nothing but the magnetic pole.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have.been reading in Howitt's Haunts and Homes of British Poets a statement that some of Shalres family are living in obscurity and destitution. God forbid it should continue so I . . . . I know not whether I have said it anywhero, but I have often thought it, that all the poetry that has existed, from the song of the angels at the creation down to the present hour, is not worth his and MElton's; nor has there been any philosophy so applicable, so generous, or so sound. He and Defoe have afforded the most delight to their native land. Some little was done for the descendAnt of Defoe; shaU nothing be done forthe descendant of Shakspeare? Pardon, Sir, my importunity. You have once made my voice heard; raise yours above It now, in a cause more noble still. During the short term of my life, I wiU subscribe 51. yearlyto avert a national disgrace.

ENYGL!SH CONSULS ABROAD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am a British subject, one of those pioneers who, forsakng home and fam'iy, have pushed their fortunes in countries several thousands of miles from their native land, braving dangers of climate, risldng everything, in order that our commerce might be extended to the most remote districts, and thereby adding each one his mite to those gigantic commercial enterprises which have raisedGreat Brians to her present proud position. The history of England's wealth may be traced to the enterprising character of her merchant ploneers; to them alone does she owe her large exports and her home industry. Year after year remote countries hitherto unknown are explored, and goods may hce dsily seen leavin the docks of Liverpool consigned top s not to he found upon any map or described by any traveller,-perhape consigned to an agent who has just discovered a retired Indian village and established himself It is thus that England becomes known; the enterprising spirt of her subjects is admired, and demands for goods, which at first amount to a few thousand dollars, increase in time to millions. Such is the true origin of England's wealth - and to the merobant pioneers is due, without doubt, the creiit of havinig brought their country to such a high state of cultivation. But unaided by his Government the pioneer merchant will run continual risk. His position, that of a stranger iving in the midst of a half-civilized race-a Protestant dwelling among people professing a religion half Indian and the other half Roman Catholic, embodying a state of bigotry and fanaticism of the most violent kind-renders it necessary that he should have some securith, some appeal in the event of an attempt against his life or his property. He lives thousands of miles from an English army, and, as has beenthecasinmy districtin Central America, he has seen but one vessel of war during the last four years. He is therefore compelled to throw himself upon the meroy of a half-civitized Indian Alcalde, who subjects him to every kind of annoyance, who makes him make the sign of the cross, and laughs at the Protestant whUe he does so, calls him a heretic, and finally dismisses the case by giving judgment against him on the plea that he must be in the wrong because he is not a Criastno. A1 this, and much more, did British subjects suffer in Central America, untl' the attention of our Government was turned to the increasing trade with these countries. and the necesity became i4pparent of appointing consuls to each republic. Then, for the first time, did we breathe freely- the merchaat had justice done to him without the necessiztv of appealing to fanatical and drunken Alcaldes. Whenever attempts were made to extort forced oontributions, or otherwise ilegally interfere with him, the merchant bad merely to say, "I plce my case in the British Consul's hands and will abide by his decision," and no further attempts were made to injure him. Under this better state of affairs the commerce of England has increased, and we monopolize nine-tenths of the trade of the whole of Central America. English goods find their way into the most remote villages; English property is respected, and British subject masy travel unarmed wherever their inclination may lead them. But will this state of things last ? If the power and authority vested In Her Majesty's Consuls abroad are curtailed, I most emphatically say, no. During my experience of 25 years in foreign and remote countries I have observed that the treatment of British subiects abroad depends entirely upon the due respect, and I may say fear, which halfeivilized nations entertain of Consuar interference. Divest Consuls, therefore, of the power which the necessities of commerce and the experience of aae prove that Consuls should be invested with, and then, [ask, who will be a pioneer ?-what British subject will risk his life and pital thousands of miles away from Bow-street or from the British army and navy? The late disgraoeful conduct of the Opposition in the Houses of Parliament-dsgraceful, beeause men placed by their countrymen to represent them basely sacrificed the interests of the peoDle at large to their own party feelingshas caused no little alarm and distrust abroad. But Englishmen abroad hope that their countrymen wiU not be influenced by such prooeedings, and that the displeasure of the people willbe signally marked during the forthcoming election. I but-re$erate the sentiments of all Englishmen living in this country when I declare that, if the only protection we enjoy-thatof cur Consuls-is withdrawn, or rendered null and void through the influence of party feeling, we must retire, one and all, and leave the field of enterprise opent to the subjects of other nations.

THB UMImED STATEs. (mmOUIL OW?Yo~~pw~, NEW YORK, Jtnu. 2. The heavens have openied for nearly a week upon our muddy Atreet& without perceptibly diminishing. the accuirstion of filth. The dogatar temperature has come long before its time, nosquitoes and miasma alike fill the air, torrents of rain are suCceeded by hot sunshine wis sanitarians prophesy all sorts of diseases, and' yet New York remains dirtY and growa dirtier. Ir wonder that this cityihas not been swept from the face of the earth by some peatilence long before this. Nothing but some awful caamity for which it is reserved hereafter can account for ito savation hitberto. Those who are a6customed to London, with its excellent sewers and its well-cleaned streets, cannot have any idea of the miseries to which the merchants of the Western metropolis are subjectedl. I believe that there is scarcely ever a time when the streets are in order. In the winter we are told that it is impossible to remove th - snow; we wade patiently through the dirty sand, looking like a crushed tertiary formation-much worse, however, for our boots-in the hope that spri will bring relief. Spring comes, with the March winds andfrostslastingtirlthe middle of May, and we assent to the impossibility of taking away theaccnmulationsundersucheircumnstanres. Summer follows, and' we are yet without relief. Should the yellow fever appear again at tbe doors, or even the less dreaded cholera, some eftort may be made towards a momentary cleanline&q. Unless we have some such godsend as thna' there seems to be little hope of relief. The condition of things here is beyond belief unless actually seen,even if seen it seema scarcely credible in a city of the wealth, culture, and commerce of New York. No other town in the country is so. English Boston is a model of cleanliness; no difficult matter, to be sure, in so small a space. Philadelphia is re3sonably clean, Baltimore iS not dangerous from its dirt, and the metropolitan city of Washington covers too much ground to make the matter of its streets and sewers of much consequence, except in a case like that of the National Hotel. But of New York the less said the better. London, in Gay's time, must have been a Paradise to it. The Arago carried to you last Saturday the news of Walker's surrender. The great Filibuster found it necessary to run, and had the wisdom to do it in the right direction. Ai Government vewsel lay conveniently in the offing, and after a proper amount of parley and negotiation the surrender was made on terms which 1 enclose. Walker and his foree marched on board, and the Costa Ricans took possession of the country which he left. He was treated with a proper degree of consideration by the officer to whom he surrendered, and is now in New Orleaus receiving the honours of a hero. His brother Filibuster, General Henningsen, who is the real military man of the whole affair, is in New York. They talk about other expeditions, but up to this time the needful money is wanting. For the last 16 months Walker's downfal has been a question of time and pluck. His first and great error was ia quarrelling with Commodore Vanderbilt. He seized, aa you will romember, the property of the Trausit Company, in which the Commodore was largely interested, and transferred the grant to ,a new company, of whiceh some of the Commodore's sworn foes were the mainstays. The Commodore subsidized Costa Rica; and, although WValker received aid from others, his downfal may be said to date from the day when he elected to quarrel with a great New York capitalist, with interests on the Isthmus. His promulgation of slavery was another reason for his fall. he semi-black races of the Isthmus had no fancy of being brought under ,the yoke of a race of professed propagandists of slavery, and -united to expel him. Now that he is out, the disp6sition of. the victory is another, and by no means so easy a matter to settle. The quarrel is again traniferred to New York. Here are now three separate grants for the Nicaragua transit-the old transit grant from the State of Nicaragua under which the rouie was worked before the seizure of the country by Walker; the Walker grant; and a grant from the new authorities. The capitalists are struggling which shal prevaiL Could they unite it must prove profitable, for it is ehorter in distance, than the route by Panarna, and experience has demonstrated that the passage can regularly be made in less time. But, meanwhile, the whole California traffic threatens to become less profitable. Eastern capital, it is said, is withdrawing from San Francisco. Two large capitalists have already retired from that market, and others are about to follow. Real estate has fallen there, the import of goods is diminishing, and there are various other signs to show that the prosperity fever has worked itself to a white beat and is now cooling down. Still the production of gold does not sensibly diminish, nor is there any present reason to fear that it will do so. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the increase of quartz-crushing machines will hereafter increase the regular production of the precious metal in a way that can be depended upon. There seems also to be a disDosition, in that remote region, to pay its debts, if legislative action can be taken as an exponent of popular feeling. The Legislature have passed a law legalizing the over-issue of State Bonds, and have directed that the popular vote be taken upon the question in such a way as to almost insure its legalization. Upon the back of the " tickets" at the next general election the voters are to inscribe whether they are for repudiation or for payment. As the "1 tickets " for each party are printed and issued by a central committee, this gives the wire-pullers power to control the matter. It is said to be the intention to issue none except with the right inscription. If this machinery works well it may be recommended to the politicians of Misissippi, Florida, and Michigan. The Arago, on Saturday last, carried out Grelet, the defaulting clerk of the Northern Railway of France. On Thursday the judgment of the commissioner upon the long drawn out evidence was quietly made up and transmitted to Washington. The return mail brought3a warranfrom the State Department for the extradition o the offender. Resistance was of course to be expected in these days of writs of habeas corpns and injunctions. To insure against these the prisoner was put on board a tug steamer. He resisted stoutly, cursed and swore, struck at the officers, screamed, and otherwise manifested his indisposition to return to that beautiful country whicn every Frenchman thinks without a paralleL But the marshal was inexorable, put him in irons, and carried him down the harbour in the steamtug. When the habeas cowqu came out from the State Courts the prisoner was in the offing awaiting the sailing of the Arago, to which he was duly transferred; and it is to be hoped that before this reaches you he will be restorel to the charns of Paris. The conflict between State and Federal jurisdictions, which was attempted in the case of Grelet, had actualy happened in Ohio. The United States' marshal, charged with a warrant for the arrest and extradition of certain fugitive slaves, took possession of the walking chattels for the purpose of carrying them off. The people of the neighbourhood interfered, and the slaves escaped. Then process was sued out against those wbo had aided in the escape, and they were arrested. This was followed by a habeas corpus for their recovery. The marshal and his followers forcibly resisted the service of h writ and were ta_en ito custody by the State authorities, and are now confined in gaol awaiting their trial for this offence. In the meautime they have reported to Washington the resistance with which the enforeement of the fugitive slave law was met, and there promises to be a very pretty little quarrel. I think, but of this I am not quite sure, that the State of Ohio, like several of the Nortbern States, has enacted a stringent law for the pTotection of the personal liberty of its citizens. If so, there may be constitutional questions'growing out of this case as important as those decided in the famous Dred Scott case. The Southern Counties of Ohio border upon Kentucky, a Slave State. The Northern and Central counties are mostly peopled by the descendants of Eastern emigrants, and are strongly anti-slavery. lu the conflict of jurisdic. tion it is therefore likely that the State authorities will be strongly supported by the people of. the State, andthat the world will again see in Democratic America a law enforced by physical power in a community to which it is extremely odious. The brother of the great founder of Mormonism has come out with a manifesto against Brigham Young, charging him with all manner of crimes, from treason down to petty larceny. The worst of the charges is that there is every reason to believe them true. 2,000 troops are to be sent with the new governor; but 2,000 troops are a -bagatelle compared with the difficulty to be met and overcome. There is quartered in the territory of the United States a force of may thousands hostile to it in spirit, in religion, and in institutions, animated by theomtic fervour, iand united by oommon supertiti6n 'If oWe canbelieve thestories*hich Werecejie. from those remote regioiL no excemes aetoo great for public sanction it committed upon, thoie hostile to the prevailing religion. This Government, -wi nake a mistake if it fais to strike an exterminating 'blow before the iest grows any worse. The trip of the Niagara to London aeems tu be confessed to be a failure by the press, ithough some apologies are offered. A great deal was exxeeted of this veseL She was talke out of the hand of the naval architet, and her design and structure intrusted to the late MIr. Steers, the builder of the famous yacht Aaerica. It may be that the has not bad a fair trial yet, and that she ought to carry her battery to make her trim for fait sailing; but she must do better than she haa yet done to make that battery of much use in the peculiar service for which she is intended. The woman killed at Newburg some time since turned out yesterday to have been the wife of a negro in Masuchusetts, who came to New York for the double purpose of intrigue and plunder, and who met her fate while in pursuit of one or the other object. Just as we were congratulating ourselves upon having a clue to one of the many murders committed here lately, the deceased woman, whose remains had been fully identified by her husband, walked into courtwith a paramour and put in a protest against being conidered dead. The husband reluctantly dried his tears, and the wife walked away with her companion. This is the second time this bodv has been identified in this manner. The telegraph conveys intelligence this morning of an election riot in W-ahington yeterday more serious than anything that has happened for -many year A band of rowdies, somewhat of the Kidderminster stamp, came over from Baltimore to control the polls, and when interfered -with fired upon the people; the troops, in return, fired upon them. Some seven or eight were killed, and many more seriously wounded. We also have this morning, in the Herald, Governor Walker's address on entering upon the duties of his offlce in KEasa. Previons letters have snticipated its contents. T'here has been some-rhat of a rally in stocks since the last packet, but, as compared with some weeks since, everythng is depresed, exhibiting a want of confidence. This reaction consejuent on the great land speculations of the west is seriously feared, and prudent merchants have been for some time preparing for it. The superstitions of Pennsylvania bid fair to rival the spiritual demonstrations of New England and the witchcraft demonstrations of Kent. Some six years ago a lady in the interior of that State died from consumption. Since then, three or four of her farmily having died from the same cauee, the survivors became alarmed, and were persuaded by their credulous friends that the deceased had sucked her winding-sheet into her mouth, and that as long as it stayed there some one of her relatives must follow her. Only on a Sunday could the thing bo righted, and on a Sunday in this month the remains were exhumed to destroy the charm. It is needless to say that after so long a burial there was little left to jutify their credulous fears.
SO HE1 EDITOR OF TEE TIME& Sir,-Colorel Dixon; superintendent of the Enfield smaU Arms Factom, states in your columns of to-day, in reply to a letter of mine of the 5th inst., that my statement with refrenoe to the pattern Enfield Afle is not consstent with fact. If the oommittce of oficer who invited the gmmakers to send modelX and who afterads lected from the num. her before them those 2nget approved of, are to have the credit of having designed the gun, Colonel Dixon is right and I a2n wrong. I do not suppose that any one gun combined al the poinis subsequently adepted, but this doei not affect the main queson. Colonel Dixon is in error In stating that I Allege as a grievnoe the Government not having presented the arma now being made at Enfield to the trade at Birmingham. I never expressed the slightest wish that the Governmelnt should do so, but I did consider it a grievance that it should be stated that Birmingham was kept up, in the quality of Ahe arms produced, by Ffield examples of workmaiship which we never saw. Enfield not having yet made an arm which ha seen servie it is premature to say that the interchangeability of the several parts of the gun *hich Enfield is attemptitg to effect can be accomplished and, at the same time, an ara he prodceed which will stnd the severe inspection and tests to which our guns are submitted. It must notbeasmumed that Birmingham cannot maleany of the parts of the gun to interchange beause we could n.t do so wmththe sword bayonets alluded to by Colonel Dixon. Those bayonets were -procured by the Government from Germany, and we unhestatingly rejected the posibility of making them interchange, as on inspection we found they were not made with sufficient truth. Had the swords been correct we were prepared to do what was required. Colonel Dixon may be well asured that a trade which hms been rooted in Birmngham now for centuries, and on which many thousands of our working chsses are dependent for their support, will not be lost to the town for Jack of enter. prise in adopting whatever real improvements may arise; we shall not wait for the manufacturers of any other plaoe to lead the way.

1,ANDING OF JinUSTEPUS AT NW YoRp - The decks of the steamer were black with a motley crowd, which seemed packed together almost as tight a8 the live, yet slightly darker freight of slavers. The dresses of the paengers were unique, conssting of loose, dark-coloured pants, diry flannel shirts, straw hats, Kossuth hats and caps, without coats, neckerchief, or vest, Such, at leat, was the wearing apparel of nearly all of the paengers on the hurriane deck. Their looks, unshaven, dark, app*rently dity faese, neglected hair-indeed, their whole app3aranoe well accorded with their habiliments. Some had a valise and a rolled up blanket thrown over their shoulders or in their hands. On the stern of the main deck were the first cabin pssengers Their appeance was much better than that of those above described, tbough it was peculiar, and their dresses quite diversified. When the steamer had hauled round so as to nearly touch the lower side of the pier a knowing onepointed bis finger to a black-bearded, well-built man, wearing a wide-awake Koesuth hat, and said, "That is General Ienningsen." A murmur ran through the crowd, and every eye was strainsfd to see the hero of Granada. One who had "been to the wars" proposed three cheers for General Henningsen, but the crowd hsd not seewu their man, or fearing, perhap a sell, made but a dull, though half ludicrous response. This drew a slight bow from General Henningsen; and the pengers standing before him stepped back, so as to leave im standing prominently before the multitude, who then immediately gve the General three hearty cheers and repeated the number in tigers. Henningsen bowed politely in response. The crowd then cried out, "Hurrah for General Henningsen," "Bear him out," "Carry him on your shoulders," "lake way for the General," &o. lTe gteamboat touched the wharf, and before the gang plank could be pulled int-o the boat dozens were leapitlg on to it, ulimbing upLthe wheels, aDd in every way seeking ingress to the boat, even to the peril of their lives. To describe the confusion, the crowdmng, surging, stepping on toes, dragging trunks, ballooing of oommands, jabbeting of passengerS, and the recldesg headstrong plunging and insos tent of ciousness of the cab-drivers would be impossible. The voices of Americans, Irish, Spanard, and Germs11 were all hebrd commingled, grating and crashing together. I` was impossible to stand still; it was impossible to move from your plaoe. Every person disregarded everybody else. and tried only to look out for number one. The respectful questions of reporters were entirely dasregarded, if they asked a man who looked like a Filibuster brave a question, he looked at them suspiciously and deigned not a reply. General Henningsen left the boat immediately on her anding, and the other passengers began to pour out; cab after cab was filled, but stil the stream flowed on in an undiminished current. The passengers issued forth with trunks, boxes, bundles, carpet-bags, and every imaginable etoetera-a stranger looking crew than insued from the belly of the wooden horse so fatal to Priam's power. General Henningsen was immediately on landing stir. rounded by the crowd of his old comrades and enthusiastio admirers, and a general shaling of hands and friendly intercbange of greetings took place, which caused some detention before the carrages which had been provided could be resched. A barouche and four and several carrigs were soon filled with the General and his more immediate friends, and amid the cbeers of the multitude the party drove off through Chambers-street and Broadway to the St. Nicholas attracting all along the route the attention and wonder of pedestrians. With the scant of true soldiers tho party soon reached the saloon, where a few minutes suffliced for the punishment of some good liquor, and, re-invigorated thereby, the company resumed their seats in the carriages, and drove to the house of General Hen. ningsen- in Twelfth-street Word had been previously sent to Mr. Henningsen that she might expect her husband; and as th-exrrige drove upsbe stood waitingto reeeivebhimn That the greeting wascordial and that the movements usu under suCh circumstances would be observed on this occasion the company did not doubt; and after allowing a reasonable length of timeforl.Henningeentoreooverfromthenatural emotion on so pleasurable a meeting, they entered the house and wero cordially greeted by her and her few friends present. Among the intimate friends of General Henning.. sen and the Nicaraguan caum present, were General Wheat, Captain Frank Anderson, General Carneau, General Green, Thomas Francis Meagher, and others After a brief getinR of the Genal and oordial oongratulation of his lady the visitors retired, leaving the hero of "erim visaed vir-" iu' the peaceful enjoyment of domestic felicity. !1e h bearing evident traces of the fatigue of his six nMis campaign, the General loo1ks hale and hearty, and ieli able to add nowr laulrels to those which he ho,s s67ibly 'on,-Z{CW Ycr;- Heracl~ - *- -

THE LICENSra SYSMZT. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TI S. Sir,-Mr. Buxton explained in hbi letter to you that he bieves that ll the London brewers "act on the ame system with regard to their publican'" He further oxplained that, although many of his own publicans had recived loas fromhim, they were none the les free agents, " a those loas could be paid of£ at any moment by any other brewer with whom the pubi can preferred to deaL" This would Imply that Messre Barclay and Perldnss pub. licans were in the habit of goingover whenevertlaey plemed to eaes.m Truman, Haabury, Buxton, and Co., and those of Messm Goding to Meux, DeeMd, and Co., who recived them with open arms and purs. But Mr. Hsnbury, in hlis evidence which I have alredy quoted, aid, "that when the customer of another brewer comes to us and tels us that he is under any obliations to another brewer, we do not supply him tMI he has paidofl h obligtion to the other brewer." He doesnot say "we fImme diately hasten to pay off his ob'lgations and supply him ourselves." Yet that is what Mr. Buxton decares to be the practice. Now, I cannot reconcile these two statements. Which apPear to meto conflict with each other. It is not, however, of much consequence that they should be reconciled; beoause, if all tho great London brewers act on the same principle in dealing with their publicaNs-or, in Mr. Hanbury's words-, " have an honourable under. standing with each other," a publican dissatisfied with Mers. Truman, Hanbury, Buxton, and Co.'s mode of sup. ply would' In no way better hims#f by going over to . Barclay and Perkins, their mode being presely similar to thtfrom whiclhhewishecitcope. AnaI am, moreover, asured that "an honourable underxanding exists among the great brewers "not to e4courage pubSican In thus migrating from one firm to another." Mr. Eanbury observes that brewers lend money to their publicans exacly as bankers make advances to their customers. Not quite. If my banker advano me moneyontabun-dle of railway debentures, or on the title deeds of my eat tes in Ayrsbire, he makes no Inquirled as to my past obJHgtieons to others, or as to my future dealings '4th himielf. BLt it appears that a brewer Insists 'on a nev customer discharging all obligations to other breweribefore.he wiJl aervo him at all on any terms, and he binds him, moreover,. by "an honourable obliation" to deal with him il futre Worehe lendi him any 'money, this 'f honourable oobltg. tion" being corroborated by a power of selling the publico up If he infringes it. A friend of mine, at one of those family epochs when pure porter becomes the main desideratum of everygood husband -ad Anxious father!, ked a great brewer of his acquaintanoe at which of his publichouses he could obtin the unadulterated article. " At none of them," was the anwer; " sndto our brewery, make use of my name, and you will be supplied from time to time with a small keg as a matter of favour. We have so many applications of this kind that we keep an extra clerk on purpome to attend to them although, In point of fact, we ought not, in fairness to our publicans, to do so." This, surely, is pretty good evidence that the present stte of the licensing system, with which the great brcwcra are so weU satisfied, oudht not to be conddered veory tisfactory by the community at large. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A THIRSTY SOUL.
THE BEBB BILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The debate on the Beer Bill on Wednesday last in the House of Commons has given occadon to deep thought and much anxiety. To the clergy especially the subject is one of intensest interest. They know that there is no more unnaitigted evil than intemperanoe, and that, alas ! to their sorrow, in a very great many districts, the evil of drunkenness is on the increase, instead of the decrease, as stated by Mr. Ker Seymer in his very able spech. There is, however, nothing to be deprocated more thin an attempt to deal with an evm of such magnitude in a superfical wa. In my opinion, the remedy proposed by Mr. Hardy would never meet the difficulties of the cae, or go to the root of the eviL I speak as one of the working clergy, who has under his pastoral nharge a lArge agricultural parish, a scattered ral population, and one miserably poor. I know that drunkenness is the greab cause of a vast amount of existing wretchedness; but, admitting most fuly that the pnblichouses and beerhouses contribute very largely towards it) they ought not to bear more than their share of blame. The unlicensed houses in my own parish are the veriests sinks of iniquity and evil; they are on the increse ; they carry on a most thriving and prosperous trade, and, in spite of every effort to put them down, are in the fac of open day defying the law. During the hours of Divine service on Sundays these houses are fEul; and on one oCcasion I myself was an eye-witness of an appalling scene of drunkenness, yet I had no power of bringing the offender to justice. Paents ad oomplained to me-that their chldren been enticed into this hant of vice; wretched, starving mothers had toldine that the wages Paid on Saturday were frequently disipated -n the Sunday in one of these houses. When I represented to the keeper of one of these house the in and wickedness of her course (for the house in question was kept by a oman) she denied tho charge in loco. To prove t, however, on my return from a chapel of ae, a Sunday or two after, I made a point of dropping in. soddenly and unexpectedly, and rhat did I behold but the realization of my worst fears, and the fuest proof of every charge which was brought against the housel The room was full to suffocation, men were in every stae of inebriety, youths and boys were mingled with he crowd, and liquor was before each. The law, however, is in such a defective state that the keeper of this house could not be oonvicted on my evidenoe, because I did not see the liquor called for and paid for. To my own knowledge, for sdx yeanr this house, in spite of the excise officers, the constabulary, and the ciergy has been k-ept open. Th"er are several other cottages in this vfllae where beer is occasionally sold without alicesse, and I haVe frequently 3myself witnessed waJoD lOaS of beer from a naighbouring town in process o delivery. In reaty, when expoAtulating with on ftoewho had been drinking in the house which I deed on Sanday, he pve as his reason or excue that no wholesome beer could be obtined anywhere else, and so open and barefaced is this illegal traffic that a brewer lately put an executon into one of these houses when its custom a declined in favour of some other kindred esablishmaent. I can at this moment plam hand u;on no lees than five houses where beer is regularly or oCConally sold 'without a license, and I ought not to omit to add that in this prt of my sari, ompoaed solely of four farms and the cottages for bourers who work thereon, with the usal number of petty tradesmen, there are two publichoumes with spiit lieonses. As the law new stands aunlicensed house are most difficult to reach. The police have no right to enter them, and it is perfectly well known that in them every as of vice exits-stolengoods are reeeived there, and find ardy ale. Marine store dealers, gatherers of ra and bones, &c.; with their donkey carts, from the neighbouring towns, are constantly there; and, lastl, the poacher immediately meets a purchaser for his game, the pro. ceeds of $which he is expected to spend upon the preadaeL- Maywe not, then, hope, Sir, that SirGeorge Gxrey wfilnot orerloook this crying evil whnhe bIs preparing his promised "BeerBill" durng therecesa? IWedo not wish to see any retrAoFde steps In legislation, but we do hope that some effecthve mea^sure may be Introduced to cbaeckthis vice. The wAell-disposed Aand respectable member,^ of ociety gr mosttwilling to lend us their aid, but as the law stands at Present we can do little or nothing. Ilsm.

THE HEALTH OF LONDON. (From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.) In the week that ended on Saturday, Jtne 13, the total number of deaths registered in London wa's 934, of which 519 were deaths of males, 415 those of females. In the 10 years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weekso corresponding with last week was 951; but, as the deaths re-l turned last week occurred in an increased population, the: average, to admit of a comparison, should be raised in pro.: portion to the increase, in which case it will become 1,046.; Bence it will be seenL that the presentlrate of mortality is sol far reduced that the deaths were less by 112 than wouldi have occurred under the average rate of mortaity, as Wal.I culated on former experience at this period of the year. i Though the total deaths of last vveek were, more thau these of the preceding week the deaths produced by zymotic diseases in the aggregate were rather less, and with the apJ proacl of summer the mortaUty from this class of complaints! begins to furnish the chief test of the public health. The, fatal cases referred to zymotie diseases were 164, while the; corrected average of corresponding weeks is 245; and,' taidng six special diseases under this head-smallpox,: meales, scarlatina, whoopingcough, diarrho3a, and typhusthe tables show that ione of them exceed the average, ex-: eept whoopingeough, and that smallpox, scarlatina, and typhus are much below it. The lower temperature of last' week appears to have checked diarrhcea, which had pro.' viously increased, the cases in which it was fatal having fallen from 26 to 20. Only one case of oholera is returned;: this occurred to a widow, aged 30 years, ia Beaumont. square, Mile-end, who died of "diarrhoa 12 days), cholera: (10 hours)." Not a single case of smallpox In returned ia any of the districts of London. The deaths from pulmonary diseases (exclusive of phthisis) are U9; the corrected average being 129. These comprise -1 from pleurisy, 4 from asthma, 6 from laryngitis, 38 from' pneumonia, 64 from bronchitis. The mortality from pneumonia (or inflammation of the lungs) is low. There were 2 deaths from carbuncle; 5 from syphilis (all of: infants); 2 from intemperance. Only one person, a woman, 92 years old, is returned as having attained the age of 90. Last week the births of 824 boys and 778 girls, in all 1,602 children, were registered in London. In the ten cor. responding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,396. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwieh, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 758in. The mean' reading was above 30in. on the last two days; the highest reading was 30-18in., and occurred on Saturday. The mean temperature of the week was 56 deg., which is less by 18 deg. than the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temperature: was below the average on every day after Monday. The highest temperature was 70'9 deg., which occurred on Sun. day, the 7th. The lowest was38-9 deg. on Saturday. The entire range of the week was 32 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 489 deg., and the difference between this. and the mean temperature of the air was 7'1 deg. The. mean temperature of the water of the Thames was 63 -4 deg. The highest temperature of the river was 65-7 deg. on Teesday. Rain fell to the amount of 0-71 inch, most of which fell on Sunday and Monday. There was rain on every day except the last two. THE HEALTH O?F THE CITY. The following is the reporb of Doctor Letheby, the medical officer of health for the city:- " The tnspectors' returns, which are now before you, relate to 142 houces that have been i teced during the asst week, aud I beg to submit a list of other places that require Four orders for their santary improvement In various particular. I alEo submit a list ot otier ,laces that require further proceedings on aoount of orders already issued, but not yet comlpUed with. I have received a letter from the rector, church-arden8, and guardtans of the poor of the pari3h of St, Ethelburga, BishoDsgate, complaining of the state of a hours (NOe n) in Peahon-court, aud easing that great beneilt would recult to the heoalth of thowe who redde in tihe court if the house were puUed down, so as to malke a free passage from Peahen-court into Ulniou-court, Broad-street. I have vited the locality, and Dad tha; the house complained of is much overcrowded and In a very flthy con. ditlon. It consiBts of half-a-dozen mall rooms, which are tenantee by five men, seren women, and seven children. The house stands at the end of the oourt, and forms a cross barrier but one room Saee between Peahen-court and Union-court, which are in a straight ine with each other. That ita re moral would be attended with great advantaee to theneighbourhood there cannot beadoubt,forPeaben.courtisanarrow peseage stan ding between linouses that are now occupledby46fam-wles of 141 individuals. All the houses arebut one room deep, and generally they consist of thres rooms placed one over tho other. The ventilation (f the whole court Ls detective; and I believe that sickness and fever are of conistant oocTrenco among its inhabitants. In the munmer of Isi the cholers visited it very severelY. On the list of orders yro witl find that lhaverecommeonded a general cleansing of all the heusesin 'be oourt, and that provision shall be made for the ventilatlon of some of the cells which are shoockIaly close, I likewise submit to you certitScates of the indecent over-crowding ot two of the houses in the court, asaiso of houses inHaliimoon-atreet, Rose and Crown-court, Fster-gtreet, aud.Sherrot's-buildings. "There are two sheds, for they can hard be caued houses, in Angel-alley, that are occupied by a father and son with their wive3 but which houses are not iit for human habitatios. One ef the sheds is at No. il-inthe alley, and the other is opposite toit, bet It has no number. The-houses consist of two rooms, barely gm feet high, on the ground. On house ts in a very dilapidated state, and the oher is so constr acted that the rooms do not communicate. I am anxicus tho the oomnittee shouid view the m, in order that they may oe con. demned. " In the matter otfzeference from the Board of Heath and from the inhabitants of the vord of AIdate I have to report that in respect of the former thore Js a-nuince at No. 10, Bartholomew.close, In eousequenceof the occuPant Mr. Poole, wbo is a marne store dealer, BwcX mnlating fat, grease, kitchen-staff aud bones, zo the extent of 70r 8cet every week. I beg to recommend that instructlous be given to him to store the fat in bai els with close-fitting covers, and the bones In well-tarred bags, and that thes3me be removed, stowed as they are. twice a-week. In respect of the complaint'of the inhabitats of the cvrd of Aldgate, I have toatate that Messzss Dawson and Morris are nOW taklngmemsures, by raisg the fuaceshatt, for doing away with the smoke nuisance The mortality returns Idiakte a very favourable state of the pubUotheaSth. These were but 54 deathsduring the week o: which 24 were among young chidren ot lers thu re sears of age, and 10 among persons of 60.yeare and upwards."

PARLIAMENTRy INTELIGENNCE HIOIJSE OF LORD _TursAy, Jvn-m 16. Thelr lordships aembledat a quArter paut 4 ocloec. The Duke of GRArToN, the Earl of CLAIR, and Lord XIIA.E took the oatha and their seats. k,The South Shields Gas Bill, the Sunderland Gas Bill, the South Devon Railway Bill, and 3eriton's and Hagen!' Sunierance Bills were read a second time and pased. The'fllowing Billswere broughup from the Mouse of Commons, and read a first, time :-The County Cess (Ire land) Bill, the Sound Dues Bill, and the Militia -Act (Ire- And) Antendmeat BiLl Lord DUNG.ANNON presented a petition from Castle-pollard, in the county 'of Westraeath, against the Bill for. abolishnmg ministers' money in Ireland. The Marquis of WESTM[EATH presented a petition fom an Individual clergyman in Ireland to the samae effect. The Earl of SEHATESBURY presented petitions from the inhabitants of St. John's, Hackney, praying for au Act to suppress all fairs being held in London-fields; against the admission of Jews to Parliament, from Ashbourne, Urqeuhat, and HIoypersley, Staffordshire; for disendowment of aynooth, from the Deacons' Court of East Free Church, Brechin; and for the regulation of beer houses,, from the Sunday-school teachers, Lower Chapel, Heckmondwike; also from the guardians of Bainhridge Union, for reguation of beerhouses; and from civil serVaUtS and Custom's depar'ment in Cardigan, praying for amendments of Act 4th and 6th of William IV. EQUALIZATION OF POOR-RATES IN THE METROPOLIS. The Earl of MALIBSBURY presented five petitions from perishes in London and from a meetiug held in the city of London, alU'prying for the equalizAton of poor-rates in the metropolis. Five or six years ago he brought.this subjet very often before their -lordships' House. In a committee of the House he had submitted cerain propositions with a view to meet ths evil which existed, an an espressionflattering to himslf was made in the report of that committee. He was certain at the time'that the eviQs which prevailed would annually incree, and that the poor districts of London would feel more and more the pressure of paying enormous rates, while the richer paid next to nothing. The petitioners wied that the rates should be equalized, and in that wish he coneurred. But there were certain dangers to be apprehended from such an equalization, which care should be taken to avoid. There was danger, if the rates were equlized, that the poorer districts wouild become much more careless in the management of their affaitrs than now, and that extravagance would be the consequenoe. He thought, therefore, that a system of equsliZation ought to be accompanied with some guards thst womldpreventthia. The proper mode, in his opinion,'if they equalized the rates within a oertin cirele, would be to do oforacertainnumberof year4 and to grant to the poorer perishes a sum amnnally not exceeding the average of what they had expended for a period of seven orlO years. If they exceeded that amount let them raise the difference at their own expense, but H some such control was not provided thelr lordahip s might depend upon it that the affaits of the poorer parishes would be neglected. MINISTERS'. MONEY BELL The Earl of WICKLOW gave notioe that should the ters' YoneqyBiU for Iead berzead send time on Thursday, he would move, in accordance with the petition he had p resented last night from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for Ireland, that theybe heard by counsel againstthe The Earl of ELLENBOROlUGH inquired whether, before Thursday, when this BiU came on for a second reading, there would be laid on the table of the House any account of the present revenue and expenditure of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. It was idle to as the louse to come to any decision on this question unless they knew what the means of the commniioners were. On prindple he did not object to the commissioners' fund being charged with the payment of ministers money. He had always thought that ministere money should be abolhhed, and he saw no greater objection to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' revenu bearin that chare than any other;* but the question was, had they the money to pay this and also the other charges already established ulpon the fund. On that subject they had no information whnatever. The Earl of WICKLOW said he had *noved for a paper which would have given all the information desired, but he was informed that it oould not be produced in time for the second reading. He thought the second reading of the Bill should be postponed tiU that information wa produced. The EArl of ELLENBOROUGH would support the noble earl in asking for the paper he required. In point of fact, they were not in a posion to come to a declision on this ubject without further information. THE AIIAGAM-MON OF THE SUPREME AND SUDDI)ER COURTS OF INDIA. Lord XONTEAGLE asked the noble duke the Postmaster General what course the Goverament intended to pursue with respect to carrying into effect the Promise gven at the time of passing the charter Act of iS53, that the Supreme and Sadder Courts of India should he amalgamated, and why tha meure had been so long postponed. The Duke of ARGYLL denied that Sir Charles Wood, in introducing the mezae of 1853, gave any pledge that these coorts should be amalgamated. He might briefly state the course taken by Government. The question was referred to a law commission. That commisson reported only in July last. Its report contained a distinct reeommnendation in favour of the measure to which his noble friend had referred. The President of the Board of Control considered it his duty to refer the report of the law commission to the Legisltive Council in India-a step with which the Cour of Directors had nothing whxtever to do, and which his right hon. friend was prepared to defend in bis place in the Ho of Commons. It was a step not in the slightest degree inconsistent with any pledge or promise given to Parliament, and still less inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Bil to which his noble friend bad referred. Before sitting down he wished to give a distinct contradiction to a statement made by his noble friend last night, to the effect that the Government had been guilty of a breach of faith in regard to the education of the civil servants of the East India Company. sis noble friend stated that a pledge was given to Parliament that the civil servants ehouldhave a legal education in this country before they proceeded to India, and that they should be tested by a second examination. Now, it was true that Mr. Macaulay did recommend a second examination upon legal sabjects, but he had since expressed a contrary opinion, and the Government itself had informed Parliament of the fact, in order to account for the change of course which had been adopted. There were great difficulties in the way of affording in England a legal education to the civil servants of the East India Company. No system ezisted for the professional education of our own lawyers, and if the first recommendation of Mr. Macaulay had been carried into effect the result would have been that, the young men intended for the lndian civil service, after the completion of the education speciaUy fitting them for the East, would have been obliged to wzaste one year and a-half in England without making any real advance in the knowledge of the law. At the same time the President of the Board of Control had not abandoned the hope that at some future timea better legal education might oe given to the civil sernnts of the EastIndia Company. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE wished to know whether the entire responsibility of deciding the important questimn of the amalgamation of tho Sudder and Supreme Courts had been put upon the Governor-General and his conncl. If it had, he must say that amore unfair responsibility was never imposed upon any high functionary. The Earl of E[LENBOROUGH thought that the President of the Board of Control would find no difficulty in defending his conduct before the House of Commons if it were questioned, because he had submitted the amalgamation of the Sudder and Supreme Couts to the Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) For what purpose had Parliament createdthe Legislative Council, consisting of the chief justice and another judge andarepresentative from each subordinate government, if it were not intended to place confidence in at ? Thew. Legislative Council had not absolute authority, but it had the power of advising on the most important questions; and tis wvas a question upon which the Legisa. tive Council alone was capable of giving a satisfactory decision. (Hear.) He trusted that no desire to amalgamate the two courts would induce Parhiament to override the Legislative Council of India, as it was the interest of all persons in this country who desired to promote respect for the Government of India to uphold its authority. (Hear.) With respect to this particular question, as far back as 1829 he entertained a strong impression that great advantages would arise from the union of the two courts. He recoUected putting a question about that time to Mr. Elphinstone, the sole remainiDg great man of India, upon the subject, and if their lordships would take the trouble of referring to Mr. Elphinstone'sanswer, bethought they would, perhaps, be disposed to entertain some doubt whether t would be perfectly free from danger to make that amalgamation at so early a period as seemed to be desired. (Hear, hear.) Lord MONTEAGLE referred to words used by Sir C. Wood, and to the report of the commissioners, to support the view that a distinct pledge had been given to the Government that the amalgaImation of theSudder and Supreme Courts should take place. The subject then dropped. REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS BILL. The Earl of CA.RNAlRVON in moving the second reading of the Bin said it was purely supplementary to previous legislation. By the present law magistrates could commit juvenile offenders under 16 years of age to reformatory institutions. He proposed to extend the age from 16 to 20. At present there was some inconsistency, as hb thought, in the law, because, if a juvenilo offender were committed one week before he was 16, he was subjected to reformatory discipline, but if he happened to be one week older than 16 he did notobtainthatwhichmuatbe admitted tobe an advantage. Hie proposed simply to enlarge the age of admission, but not the perod of detention. The committal of juvenile offenders to reformatories was on the assumption that they were un. aware of the nature of the offenees they had committed, but that plea could not be admitted where offenders were above the age of 16. He proposed by the Bill, that, in all circumstances to which it might apply, a conditional pardon should only be granted after the prisoner had undergone at least one half of his sentence, for it was held by all men who had given their attention to this subject that it was an almost indispensable condition of success in the treatment of juvenile crime in reformatory institutions that there should be a previous stage of punishment. Again, AL de Metz, than whom there could scarcely be a more competent authority on this subject, had always insisted on the necessity of avoiding the risk of the assocation of juvenile criminals with older offenders, and therefore he (the Earl of Carnarvon) had inserted a clause with regard to the classification of juvenile offenders, and had given power for the removal of such offenders from one institution to another, but only with the consent of the managers of such institutions. It had been erroneously supposed that by this Bil it was intended that boys under and ohove the age of 16 would live in the same reformatory hut in dlffertnt classes, but such was not the intention of the measure. ge hld reason tQ believe that iE this. Bill passed there would be many Pwons who would intest themselves at once in establi'himg reformatory schools for those who might be convicted between the 'ges of 16 and :20. He was boun4 to show that thwe;wa' XlArge clus who .would be affectedby this mau and that there was am)le subjeot matter on which it could be made to operate. uy the police returns of Liverpool for1856 it appeared that out of 19,336 convicts there were 5,985 between the ages of 15 and 21. Again, in Manchester, out of 4,470 prisoners there were 963 between the ages of 15 and 20; re at Winches. ter, during the la3t three yearm, there had been 561prisoners between the ages of 16 and 20., He nightL add that at a reformatory meeting held at BListol last year it fas stated ,that 25 percent. of crime wasxcoimitted by boys ,bet*eeh the ages of 16 and20,-.e' very cLasof- ,erSno to tohpa this. u331 was intended to apply. . It might be asled;what 'was the peculiar-conditiai of the; jitVtinile offenddsm 'who madeup that high rateoftheiho orimlercentge.fe it 'was but too true that.heyo were im.a.tavo of grg. -gnorance in allthat constit=d'tbe.flsst'rdsmentrof education, and that they were iseither slilled workman nor ood husbandmen. He had ec"ived P. letter from the chapain of the gaol at Winchester, a gentleman of great experience in that capacity, and who hed been brought much into con tact with juvenile offenders, a ag the opinions of such a person were entitled to respect, he (the Earl of Carnarvon) Would read an extract from his letter:- " I am (aid the rev. gentleman) more than rejoiced to hear you can report progress on the question of reformatories for young men between the ages of 17 and 21 yearq. I assure yon there is no class of prisoners in more destitute and perious circumstances than they are. Generally they have no trade, of at least most imperfect acquaintance with one. Their friends are most exasperated against themi, when they have friends, becaus it is abont that titmeof life friends lookfor some aid from them; and, smartng under disappointed hopes, I have found them more inexorable towards the class Irefer to than the friends of younger or older prisoners. Again, I think reformatory hon;es for such parties most desirable, because they are more capable of zeformation in two rspects-first, because whatever knowledge they have of tradesor habits of labour are not so disrupted or fallen into desuetude as to be useless, but may be advantageously prosecuted and improved so as to render such young men useful and desirable in the more perfect state they would be found on leaving a reformAtory home - and, secondly, beuse depraved habits are not so conIirme'd as in more ripened years. Again, Ihave found many loung men of tho age you name so affected by detection mkthe earlier stage of crime that they were far more willing to avail themselves of such institutioxns than at a later period. And, lastly, I beg to remind you this class is, with one exception, the most numerou6 you have in prisons. This is a strong reason why they should have consideration in this mprovedage of reformatory effort. May it be waell re eived and,carried. I am sure it will be most beneficial in He (tbh Earl of Casnarvon) had reason to believe that the succes whith had attended the reformatories already in existence would lead to the hbpe that their benefits would, in time, become more widely diffused. Forexample, the Redhill establishment had reclimed about 70 per cent.; and the London and North-Western Reformatory nearly 90percent. With regard to the practical reslt of existing reformatory institutions, it appeared that theestablishment at Redhill had reclaimed about 70 per cent. upon the number admitted. The London and North-Western reformatory establishment bed reclaimed about 90 per cent.; while the 3fetropolitan Industrial Reforisatory,whioh had dismissed 15 per ent. pn account of indifferent conduct, calculated thit out of 141 cases there had -been only 6 relapses, and 24 persons who had left the establishment had been lost sight of. At the Glasgow House of Refuge the perso3n reclaimed amounted to 85 per cent., calculated upon 400 caies, and at the admir ble establishment at Mettray they were no less than. from 85 to 90 per cent. At Mr. Baker's reformatory in Glocestershire the result had been no less satisfactory. The personal reclaimed amounted to 50 per cent., the number of doubtful cases to 25 per cent,, and the number of relapses to 25 per cent. When that establishment had been first established it ws for the primary purpose of receiving young persons who had undergone four or five convictions, but that class of people he was happy to say had become so scarce that the quaifcation for admission had to be reducedto two-or three convictions, and even that class of persona had become almost so scarce that the qualification, had to be stll more reduoed. Their lordships wouldobeerve that one very great advantage of these institutions was, that they tended to break- up those gangs which in large towns rendered it so difficult to reform young persons in consequence of the imi possbility of detaching them from' their companions in crime. There was another point, although it might be of secondary importance, upon which he ventured to recommend the meaure to the House, and that was, that it would be advantageous upon the score of economy as well as of morality. He had endeavoured to show that 25 er cent. of the crime which was committed was committed by persons between the ages of 16 aad 20 years, and he would pzroceed to point out that if reformatories were suocessful in deterring from crime, or In reclaiming from the commision of crime, persons belonging to that class, they would be of grat advantage in an economical point of view. IWow, what were the comparative expenses? As regarded the building alone, the cost for repars in prisons amounted to 2W. per head. The cost of original bu ding amounted, in {he case of Pentonvile, to 1701. a-head upon the number of prisoners that the prison can contain; in Raidifng gaolit amounted-to 2001 eruesead;in Inilbankto24-; andin theprionatYork to 1,2001. per head; whereas, the expense ina Mr. Bakeres Reformatory was about 201., and in the London and NorthWestern Reformatory about 171. per head. Then, again, with regard to the cost of maintenanoc, their lordships would observe that the cost of a prisoner for three years n prisoh -and that was the time generally calculated that a man would spend ia prison before he was transported-was equal to that of three yearsinareformatoryin England and fou at Meltray. The average cost of the maintenance of prisoners in gaol was 28L 2S. li. a-head. Now, tho cost at Redhill was 2. 17s. 7d., ultimately reduced to 20L.- at the London and North-Western Reformatory, 171. - the arkhurst 191.; Mettray, 12. to 161. - and the Metropolitan Industria, after deducting labour, 20L 13s. Then, in the case of prisoners, there were other expenses which did not apply to the inmates of reformnatories. In the case of persons transported there was at once an additional expense of 281. ; tn fact, the whole expense of keeping a criminal in gaol for three years and then transporting him was calculated at 2001., while the expense of mmntainmng a person in a reformatory for three years was sometimes 601, and never exceeded 1001. He had in the present BiU inserted two clauses giving power to the justices at qvarter sessions to grant money to reformatories, but that solelyfor building purposes, because he thought that the more reformcatories preserred the character of private institutions the more useful they would prove. He should also have wished to insert another clause in the Bill, but he did not see his way at prsent to get it passed into law, which wonld enable the keepers of low loginghouses, who in many cases were trainers of thieves, to be visited with the same penalties as could be inflicted on parents who wilfully educated their children to crime. He thought the Bill would be found, if passed, to contribute materially to the development of the reformatory system, and upon that ground he asked their lordships to assent to the second readfing. The BiU was simply ancillary to the present law; it introduced no new principle, and only extended the existing reformatory system so as to bringit up to the standard of efficiency which was rendered necesry by the requirements of the age. The BiU would also facilitate a better classification of youthful convicts, and would deal with a class to which at present directly 25 per cent. of the existing crime was referribie, and indirectly at least 50 per cent. There was a great safegard, which ought to calm the apprehensions of those who 1ooed with jealous upon the measure, In the fact that the BiUl was simply permnissive, and could only be put in operation at the discretion of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The noble earl concluded by movng that the Bill be read a second Lord BROUGEAHA entirely approved the Bil being read a second time, but at the same time could not give his assent to all the details of the measure. As the preddent of a great body, called the National Reformatory Union, his attention had been called to this Bill, and he was bound to inform the noble earl and the House that there was a great difference of opinion among the members of that union with respect to the system of reformatories to be adopted. One class of persons was of opinion that there should be no interference whatever on the part of the Government or any public body, but that the matter should be left entirely to the voluntary efforts of individuals. When he mentioned thenamesof Mr. Commissioner Ill and Mrs. Mary Carpenter as among thoseowho held that opinion the House would perceive there was strong authority for objecting to this Bill. It was only right to add that there was another clams of persons in the National Reformatory Union who held a directly contrary OpiniOn, and who would probably approve the measure which the noble earl had introdauced. He (Lord Brougham) should not object to the second reading, but he had thought it his duty to point out that there were objections which might be urged at a futare stage. Earl GRANVILLE agreed with the noble earl that it was quite time there was some legilation upon this subject, and that a fair trial should be made of the -eformatory system. Ie felt bound also to acknowledge the ability and zeal with which the noble earl had advocated the Bill (Hear, hear.) He would, however, suggest to the noble earl whether it might not be desirablo to leave the subject,for one session at least,in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. That right hon. baronet had not neglected this question and a Bill was now before the other House, where it would probably be read a second time that evening. That BiU certainly did not go so far as the one proposed by the noble earl in extending the ages at which youth ful offenders could be received into reformatoriesThere was a wide difference of opinion among persons of the greatest experienco on this subject in reference to this particular proposition, and it would require the most deliberate consideration before coming to a decision upon it. He wvould, therefore, suggest that the noblo earl should refrain at present from pressmg the second reading of his Bill but shoulld wait until the other BiU came up from the House of Commons, when his proposition could be taken into consideration. TheEarl of DERBYthoughtthatalthoughit mightbovery desirabletokmowwhatwere the intentionsof the Goverament upon this subject, and to see how far their measure corresponded with and how far it differed from that of his noble fiend, yet that was hardly a reason for rejectin aBmu aginst which no serous objection had beep urged. ffear.) It was perfectly reasonable that the Government should wish to have a fair field for the consideration of their own Bill, and if they would consent to the second reading of this Bil thereby afirming its principle, he would recommend his noble friend not to press it beyond that stage untl the Government measure had come up from the other House, whenthetwocould be consideredtogether, andtheirlordships could decide how far the provisions of the one could be incorportedwt the other. It would he hardly fair, however, to his noble friend, after the . trouble which he had taken, and after the very clear statement which he had made, to reject his Bil when no serious objection had been urgedx against it. (Bfear, hear.) Earl GRANVMLE said, he understood the principle of the Bi to be the establishment of reformatories for young meu between the ages of 16 and 20, and to that principle he certainly could not eoast, By reading tj n 4 tifie, to commiit the Govenment Bl ae6 Lord BROUGHAXK Iqgetd that th us~ble s4' *jBill and the Bill of the Goverim- wben iat, otLrHouse should both-.be *"ere oA aleefrom .50 that a thi Bil might be fraad to gbt enm. .4 TheMarquIsof Lth d iappearance to the zew principle ontaind in th-i and hopbed therefore, that the eobble eal would n Arca itto a seond reau ng, at levst. ateithe oy ther had come up froth the otherf ouse The BErlof.OAENA3yoD o isr, tohafl Ooverih ment were unwlling to are to the pro= of hitnc Thble friend (the Earl oafD If thbir Pe fri ved seood droalingto this. he o Woule l in x e n Otk t toh it t etla then be 4himtr 'alsbbeforeta nirw on tV Lord B3ROUGHAMf Ug jhat~1a -ii5yi of thi oa Bd scabjohdtion to aw nt tothe e ead of Pali, whIh tey id ot ntielyasre, hiking ebt, nolwithj. staning ny udersandig whch mghthave-' 'ite6noem to. on te sbjet, heytherby ffimeditsPrinciple, it wouli!. other.~ ~~~~h Wdrod Lord KTh AIRD supported the sugestion. ot the miott an d learedalord, belng equally unwilng to vote agaldb the second reading of thi Bll, and to anirm. a pricipie, zewhich n objected toby tany persots of great experienc on this subject. ~G The Earl of -OWI wau afraid that if his noble frits aceded thos pl P roortohe woul ple is in ote atver unlfavo, urablew poom-potion,'h h Gov lernmn Bl cane, feuenterdicso, fby ir t wouleda futhe ln b sa nid atn th spr dpeistwas of fthooe pseat fmoutndetobem tackes rto Bip,ll whichba thee agreedomine ntb re ao The Earl ofT ARNARVONf peedtothe ggfionjea, by the BAoble ahd learned lord, tiat the debate should b adjourned.

HOUSE OF COMMONS; Tumsmy, Jumz 16. The Sp x7m took the chair at12 o'clock. PRIVATE BUSINESS. The following prvte Bills were mespectively read a thirai timne and : :-The Frserburg Hirbour Bill; theGreat. way (Capita) Bill, and the MRgte Water On the motion of Mr. 0. Fonsnzm, the MEuchester, She& field, and Lincoonshire Rilway (Buxton and Cleethorpeo) Bill was withdrawn. 3AE.RtIPiCY AND INSOLVENCY (IRELAND)) BILL The House then went into oommittee upon this Bill, Mr. FrIzRoy in the chair. Clausel huing been put, Mr. M1'CARTNEY prooeeded to state the reasons why, irn his opinion, the pecuniary and official clauses ot the Bill should be postponed, and should be referred for considers. tion to a select committee. The meaure was one, he said, by wbich it was proposed to abolish the Courts of Bank. ruptcy and Insolvency in Ireland, and to substitute for ther-. a single court. In taking that course it had been deeme4 expedient to deal with the offlomr of the existing court im a manner whicb, in his o inion, wa scarely fair with re. ferenoe to the publo fund. He could not understand. for instance, upon what principle it wA that the Chief Com. missioner of the Insolvency Court was, after a period oLr only three yeas' service to be allowed to ret:e witl his full salary wbiile his servioes might bei made available in the new court. He mighbt also, observe that the oommissioners whom it wAs proposl to apoint under the Bill would be in a position imine. diately after its assing to retire upon two-thirds of theirincresed salary of 2,0001., and that the consequence woulnl charge upon the consolidated fund, wlhich it wa> not desirable should be thrown upon it. The Bill contained 430 clauses, which were mixed up in such awaythat it was impossible theq could be reduced to anything like order except by means of the careful consideratio. which they would receive at the hands of a select committee. He should therefore repeat the suggestion thal;' "the pecuniary nd official" clauses of the BiU, at all events, should be postponed with that view. Mr. VANCE thought the right hon. gentleman the Attorney-General for Ireland was entitled to the thanks of the committee for. those portions of the Bill which had a ten. dency to place the law of bankruptcy and insolvency i:. Ireland upon a better footing than that upon which it nowr stood. He was however, opposed to the proposal to confine the operation of that law to a single court, becauseh owing to the increasing commercial prosperity of Ireland, he did not think one court would present the necessa facilities for the increased number oftraders who would be likeyto resort to it for assistance. He mightalsostatetbat; the Bil instead of proiding for the immediate retirement upon a isige salary of the present judge of the Insolvent Court, might more properly have made his services availab'.e> in the newr tribunasl Mfr. WHITBTDE said, the granting of 2,0001. a-yeaWmore or less for the purpose of portioning the eldest daughter of the Sovereign had given rise to considerable discu6sion in that House, but he should like to know in lo r meny instanmcs the public money had been expended im Ireland in abolishing offioes whose occupants, men in health. and vigour, were now walkinz about and receiving larga salaries for doing nothing. (flear, hear.) That state oE things the Bill under the notioe of the committee tended to. continue ; but while he was opposed to it upon that ground, he objected to it also upon the principle that it was in no way calculated to place the laws with which it proposed fodeal upon a satisfactory footing. It did, for instance, pro*vide for the abolition of that distinction hetwee4 the laws of insolvency and of bankruptcy, foxthe maintenance of which lie had never beex able to hear any good reason assigned. He could never nnderstand upon what principle of reason or justioe it wa that the trader who had given up all his projorty to hi. creditors was allowed to start anew in life, whl th'ae nontrader, who did the very same thing, was seaeed 'M exacie a contrary position, inasmuch as his creditors d M lien upon any roperty which at any period suequent tao hisinsolvency emight acquire. (Hear, hear.) Now, that was a point which, in any measure dealing with the hank. raptcy and insolvency laws, ought, ia his opinion, to be ten into careful consideration. Tho Bill before them, however, not only did not deal with that important ques. tion, but would be found to perpetuate that conffict oZ umisdction between the existing court of bankruptcy anu2 insolvency of which, by the establishment of one coar, instead of two, it was proposedto getrid. It was also opaez to the obiection that it was likely to throw an increasel charge of 7,0001. or 8,0001. upon the consolidated fund. taking into account the extent to which the expense of! the judicialstaf, in the shape of salaries and retiring aUow. ances,might, under its operation, be inereased. The ameasure therefore was,in his opinion, calcnlatedtboent7ianacousiderablocharge upon the country without any corresponding benefit1. and he should, under those circumstances, suggest that in. should be referred to a select committee, with the viewv o11 having the subject to wFhich it related dealt with ins anstis.- factory a,nd comprehensive manner. Mr. IILINS concurred wvith h:is hon. and learned f.riend -who had just spoken in the opinion that no good reasor, existed vhy the present distinction between the bankzuptcqy and insolveney laws should be maintained. The object izx. the case of the trader sa weU as the non-trader being b. cessio bonorum for the benefit of the creditor, he could nor. understand why they should be placed upon a totally! different footing. He might also observe that while ihe6 bankrupt as a general rule was not liable to imprisonment the insolvent was, and that his confinement operated im many instances to the oomplete ruin of hbs family, and or his future prospects in life. (Hear, her.) The subject wag one of the utmost importace, and he should therefore at_ vise hisnght hon. ai learned friend the Attorney-Gener.l for Irelan, as there wasno reasonable ,rospect that te Bill would pass mnto law during the preensenfion, that the guest70n with which it proposed to deal should be re. lee oeither a slecwt commaittee or-a -commission.

HBR MAJTBSTY'S THEATBR.- Lad night Don Gion-ani ;as repeated in the preaenoe of aer Majesty, Prince Albert the Princes Roya, the Prince of Prugsia, and tho Archduke Maximilian of Austria. The housn wras crowded in every part, and so great has proved the attraction of this fine opera that not only will it be performed to-morrow (Thursday) and on Saturday next, but Monday is appointed as an extra night for it, further repetition. Such an uninterrupted "raen" is, we believe, without p2ecedent in operatio annals. The ballet of Acalista, in which the French and Spanish schools are brought in op pogition, was variod las night by the first appeaance of Mademoiselle Salvione, a danoer of alngdlar grace and considerable personal attractions, who took the part of Terpeichore, and thus vindicated Gallic chore- naphy against the Iberian encroachments of Senors Perea NTemr.
ROYAL SURREY OARDERS. This is a week of festivals. The great Handel demonsra. tion at the Crystal Palace, in the afternoon, has scarcely terminated when the hour approaches for another mudcal entertainment of a different kind, though of highpretensions, on the anme side- of the Vater,- and mucIr-nearer at hand. The ten days festival, instituted by ML Ju]1ieng at the Surrey Gardens, which began on Friday with a very fino performance of Hayydn's Crcatio-the suocss of which was recorded at the time-has gone on prospering. A "Beeth. oven night" on Saturday, includig, among other thirgs, the symphonies in A major and C minor, entirc, and the ian0ofrte concerto in C minor (executed by Mins Arabella goddard), awas equally lucky ; and on Momday a third per. formance of Mendelssohn's Elikah brought ene of the jage4t audiences tbat hava assembled in the Mudc Hall since the commenoement of the present season. Last night the chief part of the programme wasdevoted to WOzar, from whose vocal and instrumental works a splendid programme was constructed. The hal Wa crowded in every part, and by an audience both anxious and ableto appreciate. There was a selection fron I11FIuto Magico, and a selectior from Don Giovanni, besides other things of greatinterest. Thefirstcomprisedtheunparalleled Overture admirably played by the band, under 1i Jullien's direction; the beautiful air, " Oh! cars immagine," saung with gre-at feeling by Herr Reichardt; the first song of Astraffement (" Qaeen of Night"), attemnpted by Made. moiselleWesterstrand; the famous quintet, " Hm! EIm; Mm I m !" (where Papageno has the padlock on his moutht, by Meedames Rudersdorff and Weiss, Mademoiselle .M Rullersdorffl Herr Reichardt, and 'M. G&ier; and the noble bas air (with chorus), " Possenti Numi," sung with first-rate ability by Mr. Weiss. The second induded the overturo (the introduction to which is repeated, and developed at great length, in the supper scene with the statue) ; the appendix-air, "Non mi dir," by Madam e Ruderadorff; the duet, "L a d darem," well given bT N. and Madame Gassier (encored); " Vedral ario,' entrusted to Madame Weiss "Dalla mga pce, by Herr Reichardt; " Finch 'han dal vino," by 3I. Gassier (enored); the mask-trio, by Madame Ruderadorif, Mademoiselle Westerstrand, and Herr Reichardt; and the grmad finale to Act 1, in which the chorus and AU theprlncipal singers took rart The operatic selections were separatedbytwo performauces -the most important of the evenig. The pianoforte con. certo in a minor, one of Mozart's most origna and masterly rductions (from which other composers-and MsalY eethoven, in his earlier period-bave drawn largdely was played to perfection byMh ss Arbella G3oddard, wfho, consistently with the classical taste for which shois distinguished, paid the same respect to Mozartas, on the Saturdayprevious sbe bad done to Beethoven, and bavely confronted the suburban multitude with the whole work of the immortel composer, disdainimg to curtail It of a sigle measure, Mis3 Goddard, however, was amply rewrded for her fith in Mozart, and her confidenoe In her own powers, since the concerto was listened to throughout with decorout attention, and applauded with unfelgned enthusiasm xt tha termination. One great rm in zths young ladys playing is thatshe lnvariably oonsultsherauthor rather than hersl and is content to shine with a reflected light. When hsh performs Mozart it is not Mi Goddard but Mozart who is made conspicuous; and only at the conoluion the sense of what an irreproachable performance has been lisened to is felt and appropriately msaifested. It would be well if someof the eminent " virtuoso,5 (as theY are conventionally termfed) would endeavour, when employed Upon music of a ver different character from their own, to imitate Mims Gtodard's example. The other grand plece was the so-called JupikW symThon (in C), which was executed without curtailment, and wits magnificent effect by the admirable band which i. Jullien directs with so muchenerg and aldl. The seondpartof the concertwas "miscelianeous" TheMozrt selection,in conse- nuenceof its immenee attraction, isto be repeated on Thurs. ay night, with the same prbgramme: Thil eveningtheirst f-Aro!the conert is dedicated-., NWfidelssohb, and in the oours of th .fesimv9 .R,ydnp, Seao -s and Handel's Messiah will be preented. Who, after this, can venture to question the artistic taste of South. wark, Camberwell, Kennington, LAmbeth, and Walworth, where the influenoe of I Jullien seems to be quite as geat as that which he has exercised for so many years in the cispontine regions?' And who will dare assert that a metropolis is not mus*al, where Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, and mendelssohn are so much and so eontinually in trequest? - otnuly

LODrYOZV *rEDAZSDAY, JUEX 1T, 1857. In. the House of Lords lut night, The Sound Dues Bill and several other Bills were brought up from the House of Commnons and. read a, fist time. The Reformatory Institution Bill was negatived withou.t a divi6on after a short discussion. Some other busines was then despatched, after which. their Lordahips adjourned. The souse of .Conimoa, at a morning Sitting, was occupied in, Committee .with the details of the Bankraptcy and Insolvency (Ireland)-BiL lh. the evening, Mr. FAaA.a called attention to the present state of the workhouee system in Irelhud and to the hw& relating to medical charities and the relief of the poor, and moved fora Select Committee to take the subject into consideration. HRe discusse at ouch length the grounds of hiamotion. Mr. H. HEw=T stated the reasons 'why, in his opinion, at that period of the session, a Committee should not beappointed to enter upon so large and important anmquiry. Theattentionof the Government had, he said, been turned to the subject, and he thought the time had amrived, and that the osvernment were in possessionof sufficient facts, for legilating cantously, in another sesion, upow this subject. Mr. Fri withdrew his motion. Mr. AvnTozx moved for a Select Committee to inquire into the causes of the inequality of the poorrates in the metropolitan district, and whether the rates should 3ot be rendered more equal. He observed that, in all great cities the rioh congregate in particular localities and the poor in othes, the effect of whicb, under our Poor Law,vas to diminish the tax upon the rich because they were rich, to increase the exigencies and claims of the poor, and to render uneqtual a common burden. He pointed out instances of anomalies aud injustice under a asytem depending upon an area, which he contended demanded immediate inquiry, and, if the facts were true, imnediate legislation. He insisted, moreover, that, as the relief of the poor was.& national object, every description of property ought to contribute- thereto. There would be no ificulty, he thought, in finding a fitting remedy for the eviL The-motion was seconded by Mr. Tonsmx-D. Ir. BouvmuRresisted the motion. H5e remarked that seme 400 members were already engaged upon committees, and he asked the House whether it was pepared to add to the number of committees, aucd to go into so extensive and important au inquiry at that period of the sesaon? In discussing the merits of the question he indicated some of its great difficulties, with which Mr. AvnTo., he said, had not grappled. London was not a city so much as a vast province covered with houses, the parts having little connexion with each other, and it did not require a Select Committee to discover the, eauses of the inequality of the poor-rates in differeat parishes, which were pateut. Where there wa & local administration of the Poor Law, unless the property was the same and the number of the poor the same in all the parishes, the rates must be unequal. Ar. Ammoe had not suggested any remedy. The tax, being upon the land, or upon houses built upon the land, was really a tUx upon the owners of property, and the mere fact of au inequality in the rate was not a reaon fco aty further adjustment of the burden. There was3no specialty between the metropoNlis and the oountry dim. tricts, and among the rural unions there were in. stances of greater differewces than in the metro. politan parishes; so that the principle of adjust, snent proposed to be' adopted for London must be applied to the rest of thb oountry. Inaspite of the increase of chargethe,value of property, eveninthe poorest parishes, had gone on increasing. Assuming the grievance, neither a union rating tora district rating wvould provide a remedy. A common purse, to be dipped into by poor parishes, would bet rumnous. One system for the whole metropolis would be impracticable, and a national rate could not be maintained.; Mr. BUTLER supported the motion, insisting upon the evils arising out of the inequality of the rates; MIr. JOBN LoaKE, likewise supporting the motion regarded the preliminary objection offered by Mr. BouvERiE to the appointment of a oonmmittee as not a valid one, and contended that he had not met the case upon its merits. He maintained that th8re was a strict counexion between all parts of the metropolis, and that the rights of labour were concerned in this question. A system of equaliastiou of rates would obviate much of the evil arising from the Law of Settlement, and effect a saying, il the pay of oflicials. hir. KN1RT showed from figurs tait in e poorer parishes of the metropolis the amout'sof the poor-rates had not increased, altho-h the'value of property bad greatly augmented, so that the rnte per-pound had decreased. He thow& likewis that there had been a tendencY to an RTizati:n of the rates throughout the country. *Mr. MALu4g tiough\ that %4 s b4 mide,
The change which has taken place in Sir J. PAKINGTON'S opinions on the admission of Jews -to Parliament is as honourable to himself as it is instructive to his party. We certainly need not despair of their eventual conversion when we find -one of their leaders so openly confessing that for a long period of his life he has been opposing what are really the claims of justice. For ten years Sir JOIHN PAKINGTON has joined the *est of the Conservatives in resisting what he considered an impiety. AU the argu.ments, if they may be called so, of his party have found an exponent in him. The Jews were aliens, or at least not true-minded Englishnmen; they wanted to pull down Christianity, and therefore ought not to be trusted with power; their entrance into Parliament would unchristianize -the Legislature, and so on. All this the Conservative ex-Secretary for the Colonies has at once dis-carded, and now the two leading members of the party in the House of Commons are both of them pledged to uphold consistently the claims of the Jews. Hovr long will Lord DERBY and the rest resist after this defection ? They are, or at least claim to be, practical statesmen, and know that what they defend in opposition they* shotuld enforce when in power. But, with a Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Secretary of State opposed to their views on a most important point, what -can they do ? Suppose Lord PALEFrSTON to anake the Oaths Bill a question of the standing -or falling of his Ministry, how could the Con-servative Lords reject it with the fear before them of an advent to office with the necessity of coming to a deeision in a divided Cabinet ? It is not only that the principle of the Bill has been accepted by a anajority of 140 in the new House; it is not only that almost every politician of eminence on both -sides has voted with the majority ; but there is the great fact that the two men wvho must, we suppose, conduct the whole business of the Conservative party in the Commons for the future, are with the liberals in this matter, and must on all occasions vote against the party which they lead. There would seem, then, reason to hope that Lord DEBBY and his friends will reconsider the subject -on which they have exhausted so much obstinacy and bitterness. A generation has grown up, young men have become. middle-aged, and their elders grayhaired and* feeble, since the Jewish member for the city of London has been waiting to take his seat. The war of words which has been kept up during this whole period has been beyond the patience even of professional politicians. The faUacies, the platitudes, the mistaken analogies, the unreasonable scruples re-luire no repetition. But, even with a whole party anxious to discover new reasons against the measure, there has long been a deficiency of any fresh -arguments. For years we have had nothing but an annual resuscitation of the logic of 1848. The Irish eloquence of Mr. WHIrESIDE may impart a little hysterical vitality to the exhausted debate ; but the question has had its day, every one is heartily tired of it, and the Conservative leaders may well remember that everything has been said on the -subject, and that, after having heard everything, one of the most sound-minded of their number has declared that there is no excuse for persistence iin exclusion. W0e cannot doubt that a sensible decision on this -question would be of great advantage to the Tory party. It is the misfortune of the high-placed and well-meaning body of men who assume this name that they make themselves the slaves of prej u- dices which, to do them justice, are hardlytheir own. They take their policy, like their titles and land, by inheritance, and are as attached to an argument used 40 years since as to an ancestral hall or an ancient pedigree. However, tradition is rather a dangerous guide in modern politics. The Conservatives in their endeavours to be consistent and to -:act up to their principles become, in fact, the most inconsistent of men. They are always behind -the age, they are always opposing measures which they know must be carrier, and which in their secret hearts they believe ought to be carried. Because they wil not in proper time be moved from the opinions of their fathers by argument, they are obliged some time later to give up these same opinions, though reiterated by them-Gelves, in deference to no argument at all. What has been the use of the opposition to Catholic Emancipation, to Parliamentary Reform, to Free T'rade, to Free Navigation ? On aU these subjects the Tories voted stanchly and spoke violently, -naintaininog their opinions for years after the question had been decided with a constancy which seemed to indicate the deepest conviction. Yet we may venture to say that a large portion of the -party was never serious, or at least knew that the country had unalterably condemned their opinions, -and that their firniness could only be accounted obstinacy. 'Now, take the case of this Jewish * claim. Are the Tories' really horrified at the -thought of a legislating Jew? By a process of induction we are able to answer no; for men -of all religions and opinions on the Liberal side feel no such scruple. Churchmen, Catholics, Independents, Baptists, in largo numbers, have no fear -That they are betraying their religion by admit- ting a Jew to give a vote on the concerns of the country. We can, then, hardly believe that a certain set of men should be so differently -constituted from the rest of mankind as to suffer from such extraordinary qualms of conscience. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that this long-continued opposition is more the result of an inreasoning impulse, derived from a certain traditionary education, than the effect of deeply-rooted zreligious feeling. It is the indulgence in such prejudices as this wMich has, perhaps more than anything else, caused TIhe country to distrust the Conservatives. People will not willingly see the direction of affairs pass into the hands of. politicians who they feel must be either fanatical or insincere. Such a, petty resistance as this against the claimx of -0,he Jews is enough to ruin the reputation of a 13arty with the thinking part of the community v-that part which really makee and unmakes Ministers. The sooner the Conservatives make an end of the tedious controversy the better for their future fame and fortune. It now remains almost the only column of the old fabric of intolerance. In most other things the Conservatives are pretty nearly as much advanced as their opponents. We might expect as many law reforms or administrative reforms from a Cabinet presided over by Lord DERBy as from the Ministry of the most purely-descended Whig. But one or two questions on which the Conservative of to-day is still the Tory of Lord ELDON'S time place a gulf between the present Opposition and the Treasury benches. Unless Lord DERBY and his friends wish to insure perpetuity of power to their adversaries they will as soon as possible get rid of their opposition to a rational Parliamentary Oath.
One of those little events in British history which provok-e a temporary iritation among some of our neighbours has lately taken place. The Island of Perim, at the entrance of the Red Sea, has been definitively occupied by the East India Company. This spot, which, no doubt, in the bands of our countrymen is destined to becoimie of some importance, isi situated immediately in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, close under the- cape of that' name, on the Arabian- coast. The 'roadstead-'is said to be excellent, and a fleet could lie with safety under the shelter of the volcanic clifls. From the absence of vegetable matter the place, though sultry, is not unhealthy, and the occupyinig force need 'anticipate no more excessive mortality than necessarily falls to the lot of a tropical station. Such is the latest acquisition of the British CROWN.: No coral island in the Pacific grows with more constant accretion of particles than this empire of ours, and few are the years which are not signalized by the addition of Bome colony, or Asiatic State, or harbour. or headland on a barbarous coast, to the dominion of Queen VIOTORIA. But this course of territorial extension, though it may excite iUl-will and apprehension abroad, is certainly as little as possible prompted by any ambition of power or military supremacy. It is merely the natural result of the enterprise, the enlarged relations, and the constantly increa5ing traffic of the English people. The occupation> of Aden was made necessary by the establishment of the Overland Mail; Hongkong -was settled as a consequence of the vast trade with China; Labuan was taken because a new and interesting connexion with Borneo had come into existence. In no case have we endeavoured to force our supremacy or. our influence on countries where we have no interest, or to occupy a spot of ground without having valid reasons to give for our honesty and good faith. In every region the soldier has been preceded by the settler, the trader, or the missionary. Such is the principle which justifes and will render permanent the occupation of this little islet of Perim. We have not sailed into an uniknown sea aud hoisted the flag of a garrison where the merchautman's ensign has never waved. For nearly 20 years the Red Sea has been the great highway for passenger and postal traffic between England and her eastern empire. Every steamer, every sailing vessel, with the exception of petty native craft, belongs to a British port. Four times a-month the most wonderful caravan in the world passes to or fro between this narrow sea and the 1editerranean. The inhabitants of both the African and Arabian coasts know the great steamers which with such regularity perform the passage from Bombay to Suez. The whole province of Egypt 'has been revivified and enriched by the intercourse, 'and its future prosperity depends on the fact whether it is' to remain'the half-way house between this country and the far East; for, whatever may have been the traffic in past years, whatever it may be at present, there can be no doubt that the future will cast both past and present into the shade. India is only now getting her roads, and canals, and railways; China is hardly openedc Australia was settled but yesterday: what these countries will be in 20 years we may judge by the experience of the past. The most rapid intercourse between them and the ruling State will probably be by the Red Sea, and it is probable that the relations between England and Egypt, with its neighbouring regions, wil every day become closer and more important. It is therefore but the duty of the Indian authorities to take such steps as will make the overland route a safe and rapid mode of transit. To repress piracy in those seas, to keep a watch over the wild inhabitants of the coast, and to take measures for maintaining the passage constantly free and open, are matters which the Company can never neglect. No country is interested in these regions so much as ours, for no other has important dependencies and millions of subjects divided from it by half the circumference of the globe. From the nature of things the navigation of the Red Sea must ever be almost exclusively confined to England, and the authorities have therefore done wisely in occupying an island whlich will asist the traffic which it is about to establish. Whether the great plan for cutting through the Isthmus of Suez will ever be more than a theme for joiunalists or a handle for diplomatists we cannot say ; but, though heavy shipping may not be carried through the Red Sea, there can be no doubt that, with railways and a river like the Nile, an increasing quantity of light goods will yearly be sent by the Red Sea route. The development of Egypt wiiU not improbably impart some rays of civilization to the still more benig,hted countries to the south. The eastern shores of Africa can hardly be said to be known to Europeans. On some a civilized traveller has never yet set foot; other spots have been visited only by some courageous pilgrim at the peril of his life. The occupation by England of a strong position at the mouth of the Red Sea can hardly be without its effect on both Mahomedan and Pagan races, and we may reasohably expect that a few years will see the beginning of a great improvement in these long-neglected places of the earth, which will-furnish, we hope, a new field for the enterprise of Europe.. On the whole,' we are inclined to look on this last little piece of annexation as highly advantageous, and as having been effected with satisfactory promptitude. It is hut a poor affectation for a nation like ours, which is carrying on the intercoiuse of the whole world, to refrain from occupying an eligible position merely because a groundless jealousy may be awakened among neighbours, who in the end will benefit by the act as well as ourselves. The unceasing increase of our trade, our conquests, and our colonies in the far East have caused those ancient countries w'here Asia and Africa join to become once more of interest to mankind. Through them lies the great high road of the Eastern heni- spnere, and every year must increase their importance, and the tendency of commercial enterprise to look for stations and establishments within their limits. In fact, we are interested in Egypt, Syria, and the Red Sea pretty much as our American friends axe interested in Nicaragua and Panama. When we hear of American restlessness and captiousness with regard to the right of hansit,. it is as well to remember that the srwtter is one of the last importance to them; t fe isthmus practically divides one; part of their country from another, and that a BtOppagQ of the communication would cut off New' York from San Friancico, and the national Mint from 'he metal which supplies it. Pretty much the same is the case with us as regards the overland roate. The Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea' lie' between the citizens of London and the citizens of Melbourne, between Leadenhall-street and Calcutta, between the Admiralty and the China fleet, between tho home producers and the greatest markets which they have established on the globe. So far from wondering that the Government has determined on the occupation of a little islet on the Arabian coast, we are at first sight rather astonished that it should have so long and so consistently abstained from all political action on Egypt itself. But in this, as in other instances, private enezgy makes up for public moderation. Without any pretence of influence at Cairo, without any attempt. to sway the councils of the PAsu.A or to control his conduct, this country has by the enterprise of a few private citizens obtained all the advantages which the most unbounded supremacy could give. A free passage through the country, and a railway which shoulld make ther passage rapid as. well, as, free, were all we desired, an'd those. we havp obtained; ....
'The operation of the Civil Service Superannuation system has given a stlildng example of the embarrassments which may arise from mistakea in prdcedure. About the original question itself there ought to have been no difficulties, or at least only one, and that one shouild have disappeared upon a little equitable calculation. As the reader knows, the Civil Service of this country is conducted by a body of officers, several thowuands in number, eomprising functionaries of various grades, and remunerated by salaries of various amounts. In times past, when the service was less comprebemsive, and the application of public money perhaps less criticized, it was the custom to. give these servants something besides their official salaries. As the infirmities of age overtook them in office they were " super" annuated"-'. e., permitted to retire, as being past their work, upon a liberal allowance provided by Government. As the service, however, increased in numbers, and offlcial receipts became the subject of scruntiny, it was deemed expedient, for the relief of the Treasury, and possibly on the assumption that the prevailing rate of salary woould bear the abatement, to charge the civil servants themselves with a contribution towards the expenses which superannuation produced. After some fluctuations of policy a system was adopted by which " deductions" from official salaries were established at the rate of 2j per cent. from salaries not exceeding 1001. per annum, and 5 per cent. from those above that amount. These, and no other, are the provisions which, in their actual operation, have occasioned so much discontent and created so much sympathy, and upon which a commission, duly appointed for the purpose, has just made its report. The complaints made by the civil servants took the following principal forms ,-They saidthat the abatements pressed severely upon the recipients of the lower class of salaries, especially during the continuance of the Income-tax, and rendered it next to impossible for a man to make further provision by way of insurance for the contingencies of life. Yet these contingencies were not provided for by the contributions which, under the shape of deductions, they conceived themselves to be making; for the condition of relief was superannuation only, and it was- perfectly possible, and indeed often happened,' that a Nman might retire from the service before reaching the appointed age, or even be ovcrta7hen by death after a long period of labour, without the smallest benefit accruing to himself in the first case, or to his family in the seconds from all the payments which had been made. It was further alleged that, owing, among other causes, to these very risks of loss the actual produce of the deductions exceeded the sum necessary to meet the superannuation allowances actually claimed, so that the State or the Government seemed to be gaining at the expense of an impoverished class of men. It is not surprising that such arrangements should have caused dissatisfaction and murmurs. As it happened, the matter was made worse by numerous inequalities and exemptions which had unavoidably been allowed, but there was enough, and more than enough, in the essence of the system to render it intolerably irksome. We characterized the mistake pervading this system as one of procedure. We might almost have said it was one of nomenclature. A confusion of terms and ideas ran through the whole, and the result was misapprehension of position from first to last. We find the flaw in the very terms of the engagement-in the definition of the salary to be paid on the one side and received on the other. What -were the true wages of a clerk? Were they represented by his net receipts or his nominal receipts ? Was he engaged at the rate of 1001. per annum, from which 21. 10s. was kept back, or was his true salary 971. lOs., with the addition of certain prospects at an advanced period of his service ?. This question seems in reality to be very difficult of decision, but the clerk naturally assumed the higher figures as representing his due, and regarded the difference as a compulsory outgoing, with a chance of return altogether uncertain, and at best remote. Then, again, where did these contributions go ? As a matter of course, they were looked upon as forming a " fund," and upon this fund it was natural to conceive that the contributors, and not only they, but their representatives, enjoyed a species of claim arising from payments undoubtedly made. EIence the applications of widows and chilthen in case of bereavement, and the notion that the fund was larger than it need be, and maintained at an unjustifiable height. But, in reality, there was no such thing as a fund, nor was there any kind of contract whatever between the Government on the one side and the civil servants, coUedivedy, on the other. All that Government undertook was to pay every civil servant a certain- allowance in the one single event of hlis attaining.to- a certain age in the service, and if this condition was fulfilled -fith was kept. Yet even here there was confudion of ideas, for it seems that the good.condu¢t of the servant was. taken into account h fixi his superannuation allowance,-hereas in sar as the allowance was the product of theontributiMs the behaviour of the contributor was *ily an elerment altogether beyond the questie, and no mere to be pleaded than in the case of life insurance. It is easy to see the consequentes of this confusion. A clerk considered' himself entitled to 1001. a-year, aud when he received only 971. 10s. he felt as if 50 shillings of his own money had been withheld, from him. It was of little avail to say that he would get a qtid pro quo by-and-by. Yie did not know that he might live to be superannuated, and, if he must needs save, he would rather save in his own way. If he hoarded the 'money he would know where to find it; if he iflr,ured his life his representatives would -be -sure of the benefit; but here the payment was eerta:, while the return was uncertain. Then there w'as the natulal conception of some immens& rld P.cem-mulated out of the contributions of him aad1 Us qpeeta, but from which thoy were Vamk likely to derive half as. mich ras was their due The whole proceeding was a mistake, and a mistaLe exactly calculated to touch the sensitiveness of the British pocket. If there had been -no confiuion between net salaries and nominal salaries, no mention of "deductions" or " abatements," words revolting to the ear of the true-born Englishmahif the salaries of the several classes had been fixed plainly and specifically at certain amounts, and then if the contingency of a superannuation allowance had been extended as a prospective advantage, like the pension of a soldier, there would have been nothing to be said. If a public servant were to come forward and ask for a positive addition of 2j per cent. to his salary, the requisition could be readily met on proper grounds; but when he asks for 21. lOs. which has been kept back from his wages the demand is not sO readily encountered. Well, and what have the Commissioners-keensighted and able men-recommended to be done ? The only thing that could be recommended -viz., that " deductions" should be abolished; and it is an amusing proof of the confusion which had been introduced that they are unable to decide with any certainty whether these deductions were real or imaginary, and whether, in consequence, the abolition-will be an! -act of bounty; or an. act of justice. If the net: salary was the I trub s lar4 ndl the deduction wasj ideal, of course the proposed change would amount to a direct augmentation of the recipient's wagss by so much per cent.; but, if the nominal wages were the trae wages, the clerk is merely relieved from an undesirable impost. -Some civil servants were appointed before the; system of deductions was established, and they have escaped; others, again, are performing the work of departments only recently called into being. Now, when these latter funotionaries were appointed, and their salaries fixed, were the deductions taken into account ? This, again, it seems difficult to determine, though the probability is that the abatements were not* considered; nor does it appear exactly ascertainable whether at the first introduction of abatements the diminution of salaries by such amount was designed or not. In fact, the whole question, as we observed at the outset, has been so complicated by a confusion of ideas and the discontent is so great and so natural, that we fully believe the Commimioners could plead necessity for their conclusions even if they had no better reasons to produce. There was no other escape froami fh6 difficity. If, however, the civil servants are to be relieved, who is to bear the expense of the relief? It is aU very well deciding that a thing " ought "to be done;" but who is to be at the cost of doing it? Of course, the burden is to be tossed upon those shoulders the breadth of which is found so universally convenient-the shoulders of the public, and the loss is to be borne by the revenue. But the revenue has got a great deal to bear already, and the CHACo sOR of the EaXCzQuXR, as our readers saw yesterday, winces as sharply under the proposed addition as the civil servants did under their deductions. The matter, indeed, is by no means a light one. The sum to be thrown on the civil Service Estimates, already very heavily swollen, is a good 70,0001., and as to the burden or any part of it being " only temporary," why, we are afraid that beguilement is no longer of much use. However, we see no help for it. In policy as well as justice, in the interests of the public no less than their Own, we think the civil servants of the State should receive their salaries without abatement. The burden, too, thus accepted by the State will here be compensated by so very extensive a diffusion of benefit, that-the-advantage-will.be almost as public as the scifice,: and' we awe nertainly not-without: hope that the 'increased dfflciency of theserviceb ensuing on ameuded treatment may soon yield some return in positive economy of expenditure.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. ------ "- FRANCE. [A portion of tho following appeared in our s=cond edltion d mtArmiv:-I (FROM OUR OWN CORN!SPONDXT.) PARIS, MoNDAY, JUNn 15, 6 P.M. Tt is certain that the election committees of the Opposition have not the monopoly of direneion The Prefects and other agents of the Government bave apparently quite as much to do in keeping over-zealous partisann from disturbing the pravsous arrangements as they have in combating the pretensions of the Opposition candidates. In the department of the Gironde the late deputy, whose devotion to the Imperial Government was never deficient, is informed that his services are no longer wanted, and that he muat give way to another candidate. He refuses to obey the injunction, and produces documents to show that the Minister of the Interior has been imposed upon. M. Levavosseur, at Rouen, complains of the treatment he receives from the authorities, declares he does not know why he has lost the confidence of the Government, and he retires disgusted from the field. Dr. Conneau, the Emperor's physician, implores the Corsicans to vote as one man, and not give the example of dissension. The Prefect of the Charente excommmunicates the late deputy, who founds his claims, however, on the great services he has rendered to the Government. In the Saone-etLoire the former Prefect takes the field against the new one; he is not soothed by the promise of the first place that may fall vacant; he resists, and, no doubt, from strong attachment to the Government, will not be prevented by its agents from continuing to serve it. Similar instances of perplexity occur in other departments, from the superabundance of candidates who are all eager to serve the Government, and a choce between whom is very dlifficult, for the man patronized by the Minister of the Interior is not in all cases the protegg of the Prefects. These functionaries continue to malke earnest appeals to the electors to crowd to the ballot; and the circulars to the Mayors are full of exhortations to use their influence to that effect. Some of these circulars contain curious specimens of offcial eloquence:- 1 Call them to the ballot," cries in a burs 0i enthusiasm the Prefect of the Dordogue. "They love the Emperor, they are disposed to put their trest entirely in him. But is that a reason for abstaining from giving him the cooperation whioh he demands? Make them undersand the importance of that co-operation. Tell thom that the mass ef thei suffrages will be the measuee, In the eyes of the world, of the strength of tho Government which they have founded. The name of the Emperor, like a beacon -which the vapours condensed by intrigue cannot darken, iluminates that urn, and discloses to all eyes the way in which we have found for the last six years the security and honour of Frauce. The Government of the Emperor wishes for the triumph of its candidate3 as God wishes for good, while leaving to each the liberty of evil. These are truths which no one can succeed in concealing." The falling off in the amount of commercial bills offered for discount, as appears in the lant monthly return of the Bank of France, shows that the wholeWale trade in Paris is not so flourishing as in former years. The purchases by commission agents during the past week have been comparatively insignificant. jt is hoped, however, that matters will take a turn for the better before the great fair of Beaucaire, and other-similar gatherings, which are numerous at this peaAon of the year. The travelling dealers in the provimce will be encouraged to purchase, as they have been very fortunate in disposing of their stocks on hand during their lhat tour, as the farmers, who have told their produce at higher prices than they were accustomed to, were enabled to supply themselves with trifling luxuries. Orderas have been already received at Rouen and Mulhouse for ight stuffs for the fair at Beaucaire, and at Lyons the demnad has become considerable since the reaction in the price of raw silk. The Americans have at hat given some large orders in Paris and Lyons for goods to be delivered after the 1st of July, so as to profit by the reduced duties in the new tariff. The revival of trade generaly vwill, however, depend in a great measuire on the course pursued by the Bank of France with respect to the rate of discount. As long as it is maintained at 6 per cent. it is feared that trade will continue languid. The fine appearance of the crops gives riee to a good deal of speculation. The vine-growers, in the expectation that the vintage of 1857 will be extraordinary for quantity, are buying up casks in large quantities, and the price of them hwa doubled within the laat month or two, A considerable quantity has been destroyed for the last few years, particularly during the war in the Crimea, and casks which might be had for 3f. some short time since now fetch 7f. and 8f. The accounts from the silk-producing districts are still contradictory. It is certain that the breeders have lost a number of their worms in corjxequence of having neglected to prepare the seei themselves. They were then obliged to apply to dealers in the artiele, and to purchase damaged seed, but It is more than probable that the evil has been greatly exaggerated, perhaps by speculators who have on hand a quantity of Chinese silk. It is ascertained that the crop in the Drome and the Ardkche, though not very abundant, will be better than that of last year. Advices from Valence state that the danger has really been exaggerated. In the neighbourhood of Aubenas the crop will be better than that of last year. A similar result is announced at Argentiere and Joyeuse,and in the neighbourhood of Alas. At Vigau the worms are less advanced, but they present an exceUent appearance. It is believed at Avignon that there will be more cocoons than last year, and that the produce will be greater. The corn crops are proceeding to maturity according to the wishes of the farmers The rain which fell within the lat eight days has been of much benefit, particularly on light lands, which had .gomewhat suffered from the dry weather. Wheat was little called for in the last PaeAs market. White wheat from the north was quoted at from 42f. to 43f. the sack of 120 kilogrammes, and wheat of good quality, from the Beauce, at 41f. and 42f. The highest price obtained for flour was 74f. 50c. the sack of 157 kilogramames. The mserve of flour in the Paris market stores has increased to 8,200 metrical quintals. The accounts from the vine-growing departments state that it is more than 20 years since the vineyards presented so magnificent an apfpearance as they do at present. The consequence is, that the holders of wmes are nore ready to accept the offers of purchasers The Monif cur Vsnlcole says- "Tho effect which we anticipated from the improvod temperature has taken place, and we receive from asl parts of the vine-growing countries, and even from abroad, the most satisfactory accounts of the appeanco of the plants. From MarseiUes to Bordeaux, from the Var to the Rhine: and from the Nord to the Pyr6n6es-Orientales, everywhere the vines are in the most admirable condition. Out of France they have the same appearamce; in Spain, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany the state of the vineyards everywhere announces an abundant year, if nothing unforeseen should occur to mar such encouraging prospects. In.the south the blossoming has commenced, and is going on most gavorably. These cheering prospects begin to act on the price of wine in the great coentres of production; not that Wo have any positive decline to record, but the proprietor' ana holders are les firm in their pretensions. As to alcohols, their rel or factitious depreiation is a oertin cfac. We have heard a piece of news which, if it should turn out tmre, would give a vital blow to the heetroot and Prussian spirit trade. It is stated that ae Government, in consequence of the flourishing ap. pearanea of the crops, has docided on removing the pro. hibitlon against distillation from corn. We mention this under all reserve, and as requiring confirmation. Brandlei are without variation; to the exaggerated advance in that article has succeeded a calm, the end of which cannot bs foreseen. The brewing trade Is going on prosperously, and the accounts from the hop-growing distriet re very favourable." Another destructive fire broke out at an early hour yesterday morning in the Rue Traverslbre St3 Antoine, in a house occupied by cabinetmakorsm The fire spread so rapidly that in a few minutes the fimes appeared over the roof, and seriously theatenedthe adjoining houses The firemen in ~e neighbourhood hastened with their engines, and Qndeayolred to confine the fire to the house where 't QQn1Xnghced.

(IR03£ OUJR BBRIZN fUORs"ONTDMT.) BERLINf, JxNB 14. The information which I sent you a day or two back that the draught of the new tariff has been .adopted by the Council of the Empire and approved by the Emperor may be relied on as authentic, and also that the publication of it may be confidently looked forwvard to very shortls. In my last Rusan letter,I spoke of a scientific expedition which the Emperor has recently ordlered to be made to the Sir-Dar~ja, as being the only news that had transpired from that part of the world for a year or two past. An ukae published since then by the ,Ttcl of th &nate sho*w however, that this period of comparative oblivion has not been left unemployed by the authoritieL On the representation of the Mtilitary Governor of Orenberg, his staff has been strengthened sufficiently to proportion it to the multiplied duties which the extension of the Rusian frontier in that part of the world has rendered necesry. The great extent of Asiatic frontier, Jand the number of semi-barbarous chiefis whose territories are contiguous, make it eseential that the Governor of Orenberg should have under his commnd an unusual number of highly intelligent superior officers, who, though subordinate to himself, shall be competent at any time to act independently of him and on their own -responsbility in case of need. In consequence of the representations he has made conformably to the state of the case, the Governor of Orenberg has had attached to his staff, over and above the full number of Generals in active service, commanding the numerous bodies of troops under his command, an additional number of general officers ready to undertake separate independent commands at any moment the emergencies of their frontier and the constant state of war in those parts may call for such an arrangement. Thus three Major-Generals and three staff officers, either colonels or lieutenant-colonels, have been added to his staff and four staff officers, who in 1853 were attached to it only provisionally, have nowr been added definitivel. As the ukase specifies, they are to be at the Governores disposal for the purposes of inspection of troops, the execution of secret and important investigations, the superintendence of already existing arrangements, replacing the sick or absent, heading expeditions into the steppe, or, when they have attained sufficient experience in the military organization adapted to service in those parts, to take the posts of Atamans and leaders of the Baschkir troops or commanders of the forts in the slteppe or along the line of the Sir-Daria. As in the southern portion of Siberia so also on the cant and north of that countryr, the Russian Government seems to be exhbibiting great activity in introducingreforms into the civil and military adminisration. One of the greatest deficiencies in Siberia which the late war brought to light was the want of a good road throughout the length of the country, and the local engineering body has been at great pains since the peace to arrive at the best line for a future road or roads. In former times the main road led in a northern direction to Tobolsk and beyond it, but after Irkutsk wraslaid out and settled, and the traffic increased with the South, the old road was neglected, and one more tO the south wan sought out; but, in consequence of the extensive steppes about thelrtysch, they were all found tbO be very lengthy and difficult. The line that is nowr proposed is, instead of starting from Kanan, to run from Perm to Tobolsk, thus returning to the old northern direction; and this line is thought to be so advantageous an, in all probability, to be the precursor of a railroad. The grand feature of this plan is, that there is an unbroken system of wrater navigation from Perm to the Bay of Finland, and that ToboLak forms a point of confluence for the different waterways that lead into the interior of Siberia. Letters from Werchne-Udinsk, on the Chinese frontier, state that since August of last Year the Chinese had brought a large quantity of tea to Kiachta, but that although the article was inferior in quality, and the prices higher than ever, they refused any longer to take manufactured goods or furs in barter. The only opinion which these Chinese traders possessed, or chose to express, with regara to the political events now passing in China was, that they were not of a nature to exercise any influence over their private affairs. The following circumstance is worth notice-viz., that whereas the Chinese formerly purchased live cattle, meat, oil, tallow, wheat, and other grain, from Siberia, they can now procure all these articles cheaper at home. It is presumed that considerable reforms must have taken place in their home economy, of which no indications have as yet reached the Western nations, so as to admit of their dispensihg with the purchase of these necessaries of life. Whatever the cause may be, the Chinese wil now only part with their tea in exchange for silver.

I Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mllo premiumr, and the short exchange on London 18 2.30 fr. sterling. On comparing ithes rates Bith the English *fro t p tce of 81 e. o lO sper ounce for s tandard gold it appears that gold is . about 1-1oth per cent, dearer in Paris thn In London. By advices from Hamburg the priceof geld is 423k per mark, and the short exchange on London is '13.4 per 11, sterling. Standrd gold' at the English Min price is thereforf abont 1-l0th per cent. derer in Hamburg than in-London;.. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sig2it is 1091 per cent., which, 'when compjared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is slightly in favour of England; and, after maldng allowance for charges of transPort and diffierenc of interest, the przesnt rate leaveL IL small profit on the importation of gold from the United State.. The funds opened this morning at the improved prices of yesterday, but in consequence of a considerable renewal of the pressr for money the market soon became weak, and remained without racovery to the close. Consols for the 9th of July were first quoted 93k to J ex dividend, and the final transactions were at 93 to i. The consciousness that the speculation for a rise has again assumed large proportions seems to create timidity, and' sale are accordingly prersed 'the nioment any -temporary circumdtances occur s to produce an' unfavourable tone. To-day the demand for advances at. the Bank was very active, and the hopes of an immediate reduction in the rate of discount experienced a proportionate check. The letters from Paris and the aspect of the Bourse seem to indicate that the prospect of a downward movement on Thursday next on the part of the Bank of France is also uncertain.

The condition of the discount-market has had an infuence onI Exchequer Bills, which have declined .to a point that will cause some of the holders of the June descriptions to regret not having availed thenselves of the recent opportunity of claiming payment. The closing prices to-day were 5s. discount to par. Foreign securities have7been firmer, and in several cases business haz been trmnsacted at a further slight improvement; Turkish and Rusaahaveagainbeen freely operated in, and Dutch and Portaguese were also purchased. Turkish Six per Centg. for money were negotiated at 96i, and for the account at 96i; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at 101i ; Venezuela, 354; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65i; Portuguese Three per Cents., for money, 46 ; for the account, 46i; RuE3iau Five per Cents., 110; theFour-and-a-EWf per .Cents., 98k and 98; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89k and 89; and Dutch Two-and-aHalf per Cents., 65. In the foreign exchange this afternoon the rates were firm, aud in some intances a shade higher than last post. The Paris Bourse is again Showing its inability to sustain a permanent rally. The closing quotations of the Three per Cents. this evening were 68f. 70c. for money and 68f. 75c. for the end of the month, presenting in the latter cse a fresh decline of threeeighths per cent. The silk and silver question continues to occupy general attention. The fact that, notwithstanding the augmented remittance of the past few months, the next overland mail will take out 1,200,0001., a sum beyond any yet shipped, has led to a revival of the conjectures that the drain may prove illimitable, and that it is useles while such an element of disturbance exists to endeavour to trace the future of the money-market. The matter, however, Is strictly limited to a consideration of the amount the population of Europe and America may be disposed to expend upon silks during this or aay subsepuent year. The quantity required does not experience sudden or material variations. Supposing the European crops this year to exhibit as complete a failure as those of 1856-and the most sanguine persons do not seem nowto expect anything much better-we shall then again look to China for a "upply equal to, 'if not in excems of, that juBt obtained from her. But prices are higher now than the average of 1856, and henc, assuming the rate of consumption to be undiminished, we must reckon a proportionate advance upon the total cost. Our entire remittances to China last year were 3,295,0001. Adding 40 per cent. fo-enhancement of value at the Ship ing ports, the ggregate in 1857 should therefore be 4,613,0001. Here, then, we have apparently the limit of any demand we can possibly be called upon to meet. The minor points calculated to affect the question, although numerous, are none of them such as can render this attempt to form a general conclusion altogether futile. If, for instance, the yield in China this year should be unprecedentedly large, the extra supply will, of course, modify prices, sothatweshaUnotpayfortheincreasedquantitymuch more than we should have paid if there had been no alteration. Again, the amount of goods wbich the Chinese may take of us, instead of taldng silver, is not a point of importance. It can scarcely ba smaler than that of last year, and Is not likely to be much greater. Thus far the tendency has been towards an inCreaSe. Waiving, therefore, all subordinate contingencies, together with conjectures as to the p' obable effects of the exhaustion of previous stocks on the one hand or a diminution of consaumption on the other, we may take this sum of 4,613,0001. as a total sufficiently to bh relied upon for the purpose of general argument. Can that amount, then, be provided during the current year without our continuing to witness a monthly aggrvation of the drain so long experienced? The answer seems easy and satisfactory. The shipments made since January have already reached 2,125,0001., and, assuming the next mail to take out 600,0001. specially to China, the total for the first half of the year will be raised to 2,725,0001., against 935,0001. in the corresponding half of 1856. About 59 per cent. of the whole has thus been already despatched, and the quantity to be sent during the remaining halfyear is apparently 315,0001. per month. In the concluding six months of last year the remittances averaged about 400,0001. per month. We may therefore fairly assume that even under the worst circumstances there wil henceforth, as compared with the same period of 1856, be a diminution rather than an increase ofi mconvenience. At the same time it is to be remarked that we have this year sent to India and the various places on the Eastern route, irrespective of' China, 1,330,0001. more than was sent in the corresponding period of last year, the total thus far having been S,493,0001., against 4,163,0001. As the Indian drain partly arises from the fact that the opium export to China no longer brings back silver to India, but merely serves to lessen the balance of the silk payments to be made from Europe, this must constitute an important element in our future calculations. We have to reimburse India for paying with her opium part of our debts to Ohina, and if there is ground to imagine that we have already in executing this obligation exceeded our performance at the same period of last year by 1,330,0001., the prospecta of a mitigation of the drain are improved to that extent. According to advicas received to-day, the standard price of silver at the Mint in Naples has been established at 1.34 1-10 ducats per ounce, being a rise of of about 1I par cent., to continue till the 15th of December next, when It is expected a further advance will be made. About I8 months back, when, owing to the demand for Neapolitan p oduce, there was a heavy specie balance due to Naples from other countries, the Finance Miister hit upon the expedient of making a large reduction in the priceat which silver would hareceived, his expectation being that by this trick he would enrich the Neapolitan Treasury at the cost of foreigners Of course, the rate3 of exchange immediately accommodated themselves to the alteration, and the loss fell upon the Neepolitan producer. Now that there are signs of silver being drained from Naples he appears to have reversed his policy. As far as foreigners are concerned, however, the exchanges will again set everything right. They will fuctuate to meet the movement, and therefore, except for the moment, no effect of the least importance Will be produced. The Royal Mal steam-packet Parana, which sails to-morrow for the Wes Indies, will take out 24,1921., of which 12,8001. is gold, and 11,3921. silver. The Peninsuar and (riental steamer Sultan Will take out about. 50,00On4 principally bar gold, for ,Cadiz as PAraoz-.0 Smiurni DLY, Tde. dAy, e4m si8,91; dUh bl

During the present month 15 steamers are announced to leave New York for Europ m an average depature on every other, day. Four of steaniera'll leave during the present week, and we understand that each willcay a large number of pasnger whose pages are already enuged.

J-UDICIAL COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNCIL, June 16. -- - - - - - -lPRXNSRP AND THE EAST IN2DIA COMPANY V. DYCE SOMBRE. TROUP. AND SOT.AROT.T- 'Xbls was originaDy an appeal from the Prerogative Court 'especting the validity of the will of Mr. Dyce Sombre. Their Lordships affimed the judgment in so far as it de'lared the wi invalid, but reversed it as to costs. They oUowed the appellants, who appeared as two separate par. ties, one set of costs out of tho estate, both in the court .balow and the court of appeal. The bill of costs on behalf ef Mr. Prinsep, one of the appellants, was accordingly taxed -and reported by the registrar in the usual way. An objection to the taxing and report of the registrar was nowraLsed on behalf of Mrs. Dyce Sombre. It appeared that in consequence of the enorrmous bulk of tho documents, pleadings, and evidence in this extraor. dinary case, and the probability of apPeal, when they .would necessarily be printed for their Lordahips, AIr. Mideleton, Mir. Prinsep's proctor, had proposed to have them .printed for the hearing of the cause in the court below, nstead of having theusual writtencopies, butMr. Townsend, the proctor of Mrs. Dyce Sombre, objected thereto, and de. clinedthen entering into any agreement for that purpose. Mr. Middleton therefore, with the consent of his party, had the nwholo proceedings printed at his own risk and expense. At the hearing, however, all parties were glad to avail them. selves of the printed copies, and were furnished therewith by Mr. MiddletoD. The. prinipal objection now raised to the registrar's report en behalf of Mrs. Dyce Sombre was that he had taxed the bil of costs In tho usual way, and had allowed charges for copies when, in fact, copies were not made. Another ob. ,jeceton was, that he had improperly allowed the fees of Sir Alexander Cockburn, and that the fees of two counsel only should have been allowed. Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Dr. Jenner appeared for the appellant; Dr. Bayford for the respondent. Dr. LUSEHNGTON delivered their Lordships' judgment. -When this case originally camne before their Lo=dships they ordered that one sot of costs in the court below, as woll as in this court, should be paid out of the estate to the two parties who appeared in support of the ill, against the validity of which their lordships decided. In consequence of this order a bil of costs was .,resented, and was referred to the registrar for taxation. he registrar taxed it in the usual mode and reported thereon. On behalf of Mrs. Dyce Sombre certain objections have been raised to the reXlstrar's taxation and report. The question for their Lordships' consideration is whether these objections are any of them weU founded. The bill of costs was made out in the usual mode when causes are conducted in the Prerogative Court, by means of written copies of the documents, pleadings, and evidence in the cause, and the .usnal principle of taxation in such cases has been adopted by the registrar in the present case. But, in point of fact, this mode of proceeding was altered in the court below. In such a voluminous case, in which there was such an immense variety of ducuments and such a mass of evidence, it was Oagreed to print the whole of the proceedings. Now, it has not been contended that if the cause had been conducted by waitten evidence in the usual mode these copies, the costs of which are now objected to, would not have been actually made and properly charged for. But it iS said that no such copies were made, inasmuch as the printed copies were used, and that therefore the allowance for such copies is improper. It is admitted that no such copies were made ; but the question is whether substantial justice has not been done between the parties. It seems that so far frota there having been any increase of expense to Mrs. Dyce Sombre by reason of the alteration in the mode of proceeding, the, actual expense has been less, 'and, however objectionable it may appear to allow charges for work not actually performed, yet the result of disallow. iag it would be that the proctor would be deprived of his fair remuneration for all his time, pains, and labour. It is well understood that charges of this kind are not merely the ptay for the particular work or labour to which they are alloted, but they are the proctor's remuneration for the general conduct of the case-for his time and his trouble for becoming, as he must be, perfect master of the case in its minutest details. He 'mnst make himself acquainted with all the points -of the case and be prepared to answer any question which his counsel mna put to him. Their Lordships are of opinion that this bill of costs cannot be disturbed. It is a matter of mere justice to the proctor that these charges should be allowed, and it appears to their Lordships that no injustice whatever is done to the party complaining. She is not in the slightest degree in a worse position than she would have been if the usual mode of proceeding had been adopted. On the contrar,y, it appears that she has actually saved money in the bill itself by a reduction in the amount allowed for each copy, and she must necessarily have saved a further considerable sam in the difference of the time occupied in the hearing of the cause, for it is quite clear that if the case had been argued from written depositions it ,must have occupied many days more, and for each day she would have had to pay additional refreshers. Their Lordships are further of opinion that the objections to the charges for the joint appendix and the copies of the journal and interrogatories cannot be sustained. As to the last objection, tEat the fees for three counsel should not have been allowed, and that, if allowed zt all, they should have been allowed only as fees to a junior counsel, and not to Sir Alexander Cockburn, their Lordships are of opinion that if ever there was a case .whlch jnstified the employment of three counsel it was the present, and that both on account of the difficulties of the , guestions arising and the magnitude of the interests involved, the parties were fully justified in retaining the highest talent. MIrs. Dyce Som~bre's petition is therefore dismissed, with co sts,
LA W REPORT. COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCr tvc-.- T I BAGGELEY V. DAVEY. J3ittings in Banco, after Term, beforc Alr. Justice Coi- RMGF;J MIr. Justice ERBL. and Mr. Jte fliunu-Mv' .A= was an acton In which the plaintiff, a farmer at Whittington, in Staffordshire, sought to recover damages from the defendant, a veterinary surgeon at Birmingham, for breakiDng and enterinp his stable, and taking away his horse, valtLed at 1001. l'he declaration also contained a count in trover. The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded that the horse in question was not the horse of the ,laintiff. At the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice tCrowder at Stafford, at the last assizes, it appeared that the plaintift had bought the horse of a man named Nix, and he gave evidence to show that he had had it a long time in his stable, when the defendant came and broke open the stable and took the horse away, saying that it was his property. In the course of the plaintiff's evidence it appeared that the defendant had become insolvent, and that an order had been made vesting his property in his assignees. In order to defeat the plaintiff's claim in the action the defendant sought to show under the plea that the horse wvas not the plaintiff's, but that it was the property of his (the defendant's) assignees. The learned judge directed the verdict to be entered for the defendant, but gave the plaintiff leave to move to enter the verdict in his favour for 1001., the value of the horse. A rule having been granted for this purpose. Mr. Serjeant P 'loor now showed cause against the rule. He admitted that, since the case of " Jeffreys v. the Shrews bury and Birmingham Railway Company," decided in this court, he could not contend that it was competent for the defendant to give evidence to set up the jus tcrtii; but he submitted the case was different when it was proved by the plaintiff's own evidence that it was not his property. Mr. Justice CROMPTON said, the plea that it was not the plaintiff's horse meant that it was not so as between the plaintiff and the defendant. Mir. Justice COLER1IDGE observed that the plaintiff did not rely on ais title, but on his possession. Mr. owel, who appeared for the plaintiff, was not caUed 'Upon. The CotURT thought it was quite clear that the possession of the plaintiff was quite sufficient as a"ainst a wrongdoer, and that the rule to enter the verdict for the plaintiff must be made absolute. Rule absolute. JACKSON V. COURTENAY AND ANOTHER. *This was a special case for the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff, H. W. Jackson, had brought an action aginst the Rev. Dr. Courtenay, minister of St. James's ,inpel, Pentonville, and Charles Hudson, one of the chapel 'wardens, to recover damages for an aesault and giving him into the custody of a policeman. The defendants pleaded that the defendant (the Rev. Dr. Courtenay) was "lawfuUy possessed" of a certain vestry-room, and that the plaintiff wrongfully entered the same after being prohibited so to do, and, because the plaintiff refused to leave when | requested, the defendants justified sending for a policeman and turning him out. The plaintiff replied that he was clerk of the said chapeL and had lawfully entered into and was lawfully in the said vestry-room, in the discharge of his necessary and lawful duty. Issue being joined between the parties, the action came on to be tried before Lord CampbeU at Westminster, atthe sittingsof the lastHilaryTerin, when it was agreed that this action, together with another brought for arrears of salary and all matters in difference, should be referred to the arbitration of a barrister (Air. Cook Evans), who should be empowered to raise any polnts of law he inight be desired for the opinion of the Court. The arbitrator had since made his award in both causes, and, at the request of the defendants, he had stated the present case for the opinion of the Court. The case stated that the vestry-room in question adjoined the cbarel of St. James, PentonviUe, situate in the parish of St. ames, Clerkenwell. The oburch of St. James, Clerkenwell, was built under the powers of a local Aot (38th of George Ill., chap, 5), and by an Act for amending that Act (30th of George Ill., chap 69) the chapel of St. James, Pentonville, was described as the " chapel of easa" of St. James, Clerkenwell. In the year 1843 the Rev. Ei. L. Faulkner, the incumbent of St. Jam°es' Clerkenwell, appointed the plaintiff to be clerk and sexton of St. James s, -tentonville, at an annual salary of eight guineas, and the plaintiff continued as such clerk and sexton without interruption down to the 9th of September, 1855. In the month of April, 1854, an order in Council had been promulgated which assigned a district to the chapel of St. James, PentonVile. The order in Council was published in the Ga-teue of the 25th of April, 1854; and at that time 'he llev. Dr. Courtenay was acting as curate of St. James's Chapel, The paintiff, without receiving any new appointment from Dr. Vourtenay, continued to act as clerk and sexton, and received from Dr. Courtenay his accustomed salary. This continued til the end of 1854 or beginning of 1855, when differences arose as to the amount of salary which Dr. Courtenay should in future pay the plaintiff and these differences continning, Dr. (ourtenay, on the 18th of August, I855! caused the plaintiff to be served with the following notice: *28, Canonbury-vilkaWingAon, August 18, 1885. *-Bir,-I amseqneDte by the Rev. i5.

Courtenay, wouldJlow him. Dr, Courlenay, how| over, frequently toid the plaintiff he was not wanted in the vestry-room, and requested him to leave; but the plaintiff on each occasion refused to do so, and remained, On the eveningtof Wednesday, the 26th of September, 1855, the plaintif as usual unlocked the chapel and vestry-room, and got ready the robes and books for the officiating minister, preparatory to the solemnization of Divine service, as ne had been used to do up to that time, and was still in the vestry.room waiting to discharge his accustomed duties in the vestry, when Dr. Courtenay entered and requested him to leave, alleging that he had been legally removed from his office in the monthmre. ceding. The plaintiff refused to leave, alleging that he had not been legally removed, and that he bad a right to lie there, and he requested that he might be allowed to remain quietly. Dr. Courtenay then laid both his hands upn the plaintiff, and endeavouied to remove him, tad calling the other defendant, Hudson, to his assistance, they both ei. deavoured to put the plaintiff obit ; bat sS the plaintiff resisted, and they failed in the attempt, Dr. Courtenay stnt for a policeman, who put the plaintiff out of the vestryroom, m obedience to Dlr. Courtena7's order. No charge of impropriety or misconduct in his office had been mane against the plaintiff except in connexion with his persistence in coming into the vestry-room, and refusing to leave it when ordered by the defendant, Dr. Courtenay. By desire of the defendants, two questions were submitted for the opinion of the Court :-L Whether the plaintiff's tenure of the clerkship of St. James's Chapel, Pentonville, had been dulydeterminedbeforethe26thofSeptember, 1855; and, 2. Whether, even if the plaintiff was, on the day in question, clerk of the said chapel, he was justified in remaining in the vestryafterbeing ordered bythe defendantstoquit it. The arbitrator had found the issue raised on the replica. tion to the plea of justification in favour of the plaintiff with 4. damages; but he also found that if the Court should be of opinion, on the facts stated, that, under the Church Building Acts, and the Acts and order in Council above re. ferred to, the defendant, Dr. Courtenay, was "lawfully possessed" of the said vestry-room, and that the plaintiff had been lawfully removed from his said office of Jferk and sexton, and that on the day in question he unlawfuUy entered and unlawfully remained in the said vestry-room then, and in that case, he awarded that the verdict enterei for theplatntiff on thle second. issue should be set aside, and th veraict on that isue should be returned for the de. fendants. Mr. KN-OWLES (with whom was Mr. T. Atkinson) argued the case on thepatofthe plaintiff. After referring to the various sections of the Church Building Acts, &c., the. learned counsel admitted that the defendant, Dr. Courtenay, must be considered in the nature of perpetual curate of. St. James's, Pentonville; but he contended, first, that the: plaintiff had a freehold interest in his office; and, as he had. not been guilty of any misconduct, he could not be removed; secondly, that even if he was liable to be removed by Dr. Courtenay, that could only be done on the expiration of his year of office. Mr. Justice ERILE said, the Court was inclined to take that view of the case. But it would be contended by the defend. ant that when the plaintiff was ordered to leave the vestry he was bound to go, though he might not have been lawfully removed fromhis office. Mr. KNOlwLEs contended that Dr. Cour*enay had no ex. clusive possession of the vestry, but that the clerk, who had the custody of the keys of the chapel, vestry, &c., bad as good a right to be there. The freehold Was in trustees. Mr. SuNNmt, on the part of the defendants, contended' tbat the plaintiff had been removed from his office, though it might be the removal was improper, and the defendant,. Dr. Courtenay, might be liable to an action for the improper removal. It was lke the case of master and servant. A master might dismiss his servant without notice, though he would be liable to an action for so doing. Mr. Justice CROs{PToN said it was not a case of master and servant. This was " an office." Mr. SUMNER said he could not find any authority to suDgrt the proposition, but he submitted that the defendant, r. Courtenay, as perpetual curate, had possession of the vestry the seme as a rector. Mr. Justice EBLE intimated that the plaintiff had not been lawfully removed, but that the defendants might be entitled to the verdict on the pround that the plaintiff ought to have left the vestry when requested. The Court would take time to consider. (StUings at Nisi Prius before Mr. Jstice WiGoTrN and a Specie Jury.) THE-QUEEN V. FAIRRIE AND OTHErS. The further hearing of this case was resumed at the dtting of the Court, and the evidence for the defence pro. ceede with. The first witness called was Mr. George Cornelius Dale, a member of the College of urgeons, who stated he was medical attendant to the defendan's' factory. The men enjoyed general good health. He found that they suffered prmcipally from diseameB Pro. duced by alternation of tem erature. Be never saw any symptoms to lead him to conclude that they were injuriousy affected by any gases evolved in the process of burniDg charcoal. Mr. Henry Sequeria,a general practitioner in the district, knew the factory of the defendants very well. He never experienced any nuisance, nor ever heard any complaints of it, Cross-4xamined.-He had heard the evidence on Satur. day, and thought it probable the annoyance felt by the witnesses proceeded fiom a soap boiler's close to the de. fendantse, Mr. Blackman and Dr. Peete, who are also medical practitioners residing in the district, stated they had never experienced any annoyance from the defendants' premises, and had never heard any complaints made by their patients. Thomas Weakiord, inspector of police of theH Dividon, had been stationed in the district for many years, and lived for some time in Back Church-lane. For the last twvo years he had not perceived an,vbing offensive proceeding fromthe defendants' premises. ssefore that there wasa Sort of suffocating heat when the factory door was open. lo complaints bad ever bean msnad +Az hi,n John Fanco had been in the emp ovent of defendants for 43 years. For 25 years they hd reburnt their own cbarcoal, He lived for 19 years, with his wife and four children, in the yard in Church-lane, where the process Ws ced on. Neithler he nor his family had ever suffered in health from it. For the last si months they had discontinued wetting the charcoal; the alterations in the premises were completed about a month ago; there is now no smell. Never heard any complaimt from anybody. William Bryce, the defendants' engineer stated that 'when Dr. Odling and Professor Brande visited the premises the process was being carried on in the usual way. He had never suffered any inconvenience nor heard any complaints. Neither of the last two witnesses was cross-examined. Wiliam Carwood, an engineer, had resided in the neigh. bourhood of defendants' premises for 14 or 15 years, and neither he nor his family had ever suffered any inconve nience from them. Elizabeth Nosworthy had lived in the neighbourhood for some years; her windows looked into the defendants' yard ; she never suffered any inconvenienca; she had kept cananes for the saat couple of years, and they throve very well. A number of other persons residing in the neighbourhood were called, and gave similar evidence. His LoBDsBIP at length interposed, and suggested that any further evidence on that branch of the case would be only a repetition. Mr. BOVILL said he had a number of other witnesses in attendance, but would not call them. The leaned counsel then proceeded to sum up the case for the defendants. Mr. Serjeant BYLEs replied on the part of the prosecution. His LoRDSiIP, in summing up, said that the question for the jury was whether the process as carried on y the defendants was or wasnot a nuisance. In order to constitute a nuisance it was not necessarythat the process should be absolutely prejudicial to health; it was quite enough if it interfe with the convenient and commodious enjoyment of their dwellings by the residents in the vicinity. The only point the jury adt consider was whether this was a nuisance between the lst of January, 1856, and the 3d of February7, 1857, the day tbe indictmeynt was' brought. They were no to consider how the factorv was conducted at the present time. He felt bound to call their attention to the fact that alterations had several times been made in the mode of conductin& the process, some within the last few weeks - at the same time, however, it was probable that there was some exaggeration on the part of the witnesses for the prosecution. The jury found a verdiot of Guilty. They stated they had confined their attention to the question of how the business was conducted before the indictment was brought. THX QUti V. BoWar,. .This was a simUiar indictment against another fizm in the same trade as Messr. Fairrie. Mr. Serieant Byler, Mlr. Bodkin, and Mfr. Ha-wkins appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Honeysan for the defendant. After some discussion between the counsel it was arranged that the case should be made a remanet to the sittings after Michaelmnas Term. Mr. Serjeant BYLES stated there was no wish to interfere unnecessarily with the defendants, and he had no doubt some satisfactory arrangement would oe arrived at. SECOND COURT. (Before Lord CAMPBELL and Special Juries.) CHABOT V. BIGNOLD, KNIGHT. Mr. Knowles, Mr. Petersdorff, and Mr. Beasley were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Shea and Mr. Lush for the defendant. This was an action on a policy of insurance against fire, effected with the Norwich Union Company, of which the defendant, Sir Samuel Bignold, is the secretary. The defence was that the claim was fraudulent. It appeared that the plaintiff, Mrs. Chabot, is a lady formerly residing at Poplar cottage Turnham-green. On the 18th of June, 1865, she effected a policy of insurance for 1504. on furniture, clothing, &c., with the defendant's company. On the 10th of October last a fire took place in the cottage, and the building, with its contents, was totally destroyed. She sent in a claim for the full amount of the policy, alleging that the amount of her loss was considerably more. The office refused to pay, on the ground that the value placed on the property by her was excessive, and that several of the articles enumerated in her inventory had not been on the premises when the fire occurred. The plaintiff and several other witnesses, servants and friends of hers, were called in support of her case. Mr. Flood, auctioneer and appraiser, of Wells-street Oxford-street., stated that he had visited the cottage at the request of a Mr. Campion, w ho was about taking it and be considered that the furniture be saw was worth fronm 12014 to 1301., without includinF the linen and clothes. At the close of the plaintiff s cas Bh. Serjeant Snna said that the defendants had not been prepared for the evidence which bad been given - they had defended the action on information which they LaSd received, but he felt he could not further resist the claim. Verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 1501. HALL V. ItEVANS. Mfr. E. James and Mr. J. J. Powell were counsel for the plaintiff; Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Hlawkins for the' defendant. The declaration allged that the defendant had engae the plaintiff's zervioeu as legal PfI9Er of the Admninistrr-j tive Reform Association for one year at a salary of two guineas per week. Mr. J A w stated tint the defendant, Mr. Revan,was generalseocretarytotheAdministraltive ReformAssociation,which had been founded in the summer of 1855. The association did not get on very well, and in June, 1856, Mr. J. A. Roce buck, v.P., was requested to accept the office of chairman, Ile did so, and on that occasion published an address, dated the 7th of June, 1856, in which he stated,- "Tho chiet greaG end of all the labours of this executive bods Should be to form an efficient Parllamentesy party.

HAsl) had&resided for many years in Bristol, and had been actively engaged in election matters. On the 15th of July, 1856, he received a note from Mr. Revans, requesting him to calL Several interviews took place, and Mr. Hall was eventualIy engaged as legal officer for the purpose of carrying out the objects set forth by the chairman in his address. The first matter which occapied him wasthe petition against the return for Frome. He ro- oved to the office, and engaged his son as a clerk. Over the door of his room were the words " Legal Department." On the 26th of October he was dismissed. The defendant had pleaded that he had not engaged the plaintiff * further, that he had not dismissed him. They had paid 21. 2s. into court, and the princpal question for the jury would be whether the engaBomentrolied on by t he plaintif had been made ont. He no.w claimed 151l. 1gs. The plaintiff; Mr. Henry Walt Hal, said,-I have known Mr. Roebuck as a public man for some year On the 28th of June, 1856, I wrote to him as follows: *B ir,-tber he frt Umewe have nor got the right man in the right. a You have propounaed the onl remedy for existing evils; for ftmhe people from without will not refcqrm the House of Commons it ~~~~~~~m~~~~~O dianatenstaff Wth that I do ot nod epar a' iving todo see you where "I owcherull tndr y srvce, ndon any te- upime. I got no answer, so I wrote to Mr. Morley on the 3st of 'July. On the16thof Julylreciv0da notefrom defendant 'asking me to cal onlihni. I did so. Weweninto vaous ex planations as to what I should be required to do, andon,what terms I would join the association. At an interview on the 28th of July he prored I should devote the whole of my time to the legal epartment for two years. I objected to the time. On the 1st of August he acceded to my proposal to make it for one year. He was to tae out my certificate for the next year to enable me to go before the committee of the House of Com- mons. He told me I should be allowed a smal salry for the routine business of the office, but that the chief part of my duty would be in condueting Parliamentary contests, and supporting or opposing election petitions - we calclated the probable amount of income which migt be derived from tlsat'souree; we referred to Dod and found that since the general election of 1852 there had been 133 vacancies, averaging tbree a-month. He told me I might fairly calculate on an income of 1,0OOI.sayear from the Parliamentary business without a generel election. I was to conduct the elections, and support or oppose the petitions in which the association took an interest. MIr. Revans told me that wherever a favourable oPPortunity ocurroed for Eending down a candidate they would do so; the association and the candidate would arrange about the expenses,,and I should have the management. He told me there was some Parliamentary work already cut out, which I might set about; that was the case of Mr. Donald Nicoll, a member of the association, who had just been beaten at Frome by Colonel Boyle. Mr. Nliooll had been at the office, saying he was determined to petition, and defendaNt requested me to place myself in communication with him. I saw him several times, and prepared the pe. tition against Colonel Boyle's return. I did the work at the offices, where a special office, marked "iegal Department," had been provided for me. The arrangement was that the office should pay me for the Parliamentary busineas, malking its own arrngement with its own candidate. I commenced busines immediately after the 1st of August, but my own office was not ready for a week. I remained till the 20th of October. My Eon was a clerk in the long room of the CUstom-house, and I removed him to the Asociation to act as my clerk. Mr. Revans frequently saw him there. After Mr. Nicoll's peti. tlion, the next thing I had to do was at Mr. Revans' renuest to prepare a gazetteer of the constituencies, settingrforth the electoral statisecs of the whole of the united kingdom. I told him the kind of books Ishould require, and heordered them. Icompleted aconsiderableportlon ofthe work, and was engaged on it foraboutsixweeks Mr. Revansrequested me to attend to any applications made at the office for information relating to the registration. He suggested I should address certain letters to Mr. Roebuck on real or imaginary grievances. (ILaughter.) I told him I thought it would be oetter to compressthe matter into one publication instead of having several letters. He assented, and I wrote a pam ph t called the House of Commons for the People. It bean "DegradedCondition of the Houseof Commons." When it was ready I seat a copy to lfr. Roebuck. Ile wrote to say,- "Leodg, Oct. 2. 1856. "MY dear E4r,-I have rea the pamphlet with care, and I cannot seew hY oubjection hbould he ane to lt by the Administratlv,He " With the clerfpart of your aegertlons I aroe, especially the rman cn-that the cause of the shortcoming of thle House of ocmmonalis to be found In the shortcoming of the electors The electors ought to be told, and constantly, that they are answerable for all the misdeeds of the HOnse of Comnon.

I aid for the printing. A few days before I was dismised of. Revans requested mie to communicate with the editors of all the country papers in England, in order to obtain a complete return of the last registration ; and he wrote a form of letter for mieto sign, pledging myself to send to each of them a complete list of the whole kingdom in return for the local lht sent by them. I was preparing to write to the o00 editor8, when on -Monday, the bh or October, Mr Revans walked iato my office and said, "I am commnis sioned by the gentlemen below to say that they will have no occasion for your future services; and you will therefore please consider theylarewdispensedith." I requested some explanation- he declined to give any beyond what he had stated. I tofd himu I should consult a professional friend. In a day or two afterIwent to the office. I found my room occapied by a stranger. I requested Mr. Revans to state the cause of the breach of contract. He told me he would make a communication in wvriting, and a day was fixed forthepurpose. Idid not hear from him. I wrote osn the 28th of October to him. The same day I received the followmng:- a Adminlstrattve ReformAssociation, Oct. 28,1856. DearElr,-In reply to your notoOf thi date I have to informnyou that the chairman and hon. secretaries forming the oounil could not approve of ~roumodeoof worldng thefranblae department,and there- fore oommlegionod me to place the department in other handr. 2. IEVANd, Hon. gee" The only money I ever received from the association was 231. 2s. Cross-examined by Sir F. THEsrGiGR-There was no third person present at my interviews with Mr. Revans. I do not recollect his telling me that questions on electoral law were constantly referred to the association, and that by reading up I should be able to answer them. He did not state that the remuneration given by the association did not exceed two guineas, and that they could not give more to any gentleman, for his predecessor, Mr. Brown, received 00h a. year for taking snuff and reading The Ti%es newspaper. He did not ray" hie could not place a value on the services of any gentleman, but could stite the meansof the association." He did not say "the salary could only be a weekly one, as the funds of the association depended on subscriptions which might fail I did not say " that I did not know whether I ould accept anything." On the contrary, I told him if I was to devote the whole of my time to the association I should expect a fair remuneration. He did not say that the gentlemen benefited by my advice in election matters might make me a present~, which there could be no objection to m receiving. never received any gratuity. After I left I called on Mr. Morley and told him how I had been treated, and that I was being sued for 391., the cost of the printing of the pamphlet. He offered to give me 101. * I said I would only ask him to take 101. worth of the worl. Mr. Travers and Mr. Gassiott did the same. Mr. Revans did not tell me that the association would not recoznize any pamphlet which was not written under theirf express direction. I told him I intended to print it on my own account. After I had been at the office nine weeks I wrote to Mr. Revans to advance me some money. IHe came up, and asked me how many weeks I had been there. I told him. and he said he would let me have a check for 18Z. 18g. I gava no receipt at the time. I understand Mr. Revans obtained a check in my name from the finance committee, whichl never saw. About a fortnight after I got the money. Mr. Streatfield, the cashier, cameto me and said Mr. Revans had got a check for me, and asked me to give him a receipt to set his books right, which I did. It was dated the 4th of October, and purported to be for salary up to that day. The 181. 18s. I got from Mr. Revans was by a check on his private bankers. I received 21. 2s. from the defendant on the 10th of October, and 2h. 2S. on the 17th of October. Mr. Revans did not expressly authorize me to engage my son as a clerk, but he said I might have ten if I chose. Mr. Revans did not tell me that I was devoting a great deal too much of my time to the pamphlet, and that in consequence it would be better -we should separate. I think that before I was dismissed he said my views and those of the association did not coincide. I did not reply, " Then I will leave on Saturday." I had an interview with the councU in November. I made no application on the ground that I had been engaged for a year and abruptly dismissed. I made no application for assistance to pay for pub. hising my pamphlet. I asked them whether they wvished me to publish my pamphlet, and whether they weould bear any or what part of the expensed Iws asked to givein written esthiate, and to call again. I did so in a few d ys, and was told the association declined to have anything to do with it. Sr-examineds.I have made no charge in respect of the pamphlet. The defendant never before made the publica. tion of the pamphlet the gtound of dismissal Frank Hall, the plaintiffs son, proved that he had left the Custom-house in order to assist his father at the of fice of the asBociation. Sir F. Tnsxsoint. in stating the case of the defendant, denounced the action as an attempt at extortion. The plaintiff considered that the chairman and council of the association would be unwilling to be dragged into a court of ustice, and would pay a large sum to avoid it. Mr. Revans, the defendant; would prove the circmDstances under which the plaintiff had become connected with the association, and deny most positively that he had ever wished to make an engagement for two years. The plaintiff in his examination had avoided stating that any fixed remuneration for his services had been agreed on. Mr. Revans would state that he distinctly told theplaintiff he could not put any value on his services*; he stated the resources of the association, and it was for the plaintiff to set a value on his own services. In point of fact; hat left Mr.evans almost under the impression that he did not require any remuneration at all. r. Revans was honorary' secretary ef the association, and finding that the Spintiff was entirely taken up wth his Pamphlet he thought it better to get rid of tim. On the occasion of their last conversation the plaintiff nMde the lim to an annual engagement, and his conduct ihowed that he did not then consider himself to have any other than a,weekly en msent. He had been paid at the rate of 21. 2a. -weeV to the day of his leaving, and the defendant had pud M. 2sL, Which amply satisfied any claim he could make. Mr. John Rev=4 the defendant, said-I am h secretay to the Admiistrative Reform Asocis¶t,,on bre be plaiatiff coming to me in July. I stated the objects of the assciation, and told himi there was one branch of it in which ha might be very useful, giving answers to questions relating to electoral law, registration, &o., and whether there were anysufficient7grounda when parties wished to petition. I then told him that if he would read up the law he would be able to ansawer theso questions. I afterwards stated I feared the remuneration.w not such as Icouldvery well offer to him, is it was a rulenot to give more than two guineas a-wtek to anyxerson , that I did not presume to value the-services of any gentleman ; hie must consider the circumstances, and decide whether he would enter into the service of the asoiation. -Eis answer was, "Well, I do not know if I shall accept anything." I told him that, as the funds of the association were entirely derived from subscriptions, which night fail at any moment, it was impossible to enter into longer than weeldy eLgagements. After he had commenced his duties be told me he was engaged on a pamphlet. I said the association would have nothing to do with it. I found him several times engaged on his pamphlet, and remonstrated with him. I one morning found a note from him stating he wanted to make up a sum of money, and would be greatly obliged if I wouldlendhim 201. went to him and said, " ay do you borrow when money is dueto yo? You have been here nine weeks, and Iw therefore give you a check for 1S. M8s" He made no objection. Ithen gave a check to Mr. Streatfield for that amount. Mr. Tavers, whosesignate wasnecessary tothe check on account of the assocition, was ont of town, and I waaainthe habit of givin my private check tothe chairman in exchange for those of the association, which Mir. Travers afterwards signed. On the 19th of Ootober I told plaintiff that as his views and thoseof the aeociation were not inharmony it wouldbebetterthey shouldseparate. Herelild, "well, then, I will leave next Saturday." I do not think he: .ever again entered the office, except on the oecadon of his subsequent interview with the counciL Inever asked the: plaintifftostayfor two years. and noier said'hisen - -ment should be for one year.. Inever :aid it would beis duty to attend to election petitions, and that -his income Owould be 1,OOO. a-year. It was no part oP our object to conduct petitions. I never authorized him to engage a clerk. I had no ldeashis son ithere M a clerk. Cross-examined.-I knew he had been an attorney. I have no recollection of anything being sid about his taking out his certificate. I have some suspicion I asked him if he was on the roll. Mr. Nicoll came to me and told me about Frome. I told him he had better see Mr. Hall. I did not' know that he was in constant communication with Mr. Ball. Mr. Friend is now the manager of the legpl departmnent at 21. 2s. a-week. Mr. Streatfield, clerk in the fnancial department of theX asoiation, provod having paid 18l. 1s. to the plaintiff, and received a receipt from him for nine week - slary to that date. The next week he give him two guineas for a week's slay. He took it and made no remark Mr. J. A. Roebuck, XP.-I am Chairman of the Admininstrative Reorm Associaton. I knew nothing of M1r.

I never saw him until the oocasion when he came before the counciL He never made any appUcation to me for any claim on the Association. Cross-examined.-He rather appealed to us to reimburse him for his outlay. Sir F. TirsxaGR and Mr. E. JASA having addressed the mury on behalf of their rspective clients, Lord CAPnBELL said, the question for the jury was, ,whetherthey bellevedthe account given by the plaintffor that of Mr. Revans, The receipt given by the plaintff strongly confirmed the defendant'a version.

Serjeant Plgott and Mr. Brewer appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Stammers for the defendant. It appeared that the plaintiff and the defendant are both milkmen, and in April, last year, they had both to qo to Farnborough on business. On their retnm from jarnborough to London they both rode in the samo railway carriage, which was foll o pmsenger On the wy the plaintifffound the defendant's hand mnhis pocket, and thereupon said to him, "Coles, what busine3s has your hand in my pocket?' The defendant, on hearing this, said to the laintiff, "Do you mean to say I am a thief?' And abused im after the manner of milkmen, and then sald the words complined of " Why you -, you murdered Mobs at Tortston, im Oxfords e, and left his ')Ay on a heap of stones, and you ought to be hung for it." A man named Mobs was in fact murdered in 1I at Norbston, and his body was found on a heap of stones, and two men were tried and convicted of the murder. The plaintiffoomplained that byreason of this slander before a carriage full of people his trade of a milkman had falen of Several witnesses who *ere in the carriage were called to prove tho words. For the defence the defendant himself was called, and le swore that he never used the words imputed to him, and thathishandneverwaaintheplaintiffs cket. Whathe didsaywas thattheplaintiff"was liketinkeesFKerry, who had murdered Mobbs." Another witness was called to co. roborate him, but he axed the time of the conversation in HirITODS}IPhaving summed up, The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 51. CALTroN v. RUST. This was an action to recover the difference on the sale of a horse alleged to have been sold by the plaintiff to tho defendant, and repudiated, and afterwardfs sold for a lees amount at Tattersall's. Mr. Stammers appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hawklins for the defendant. The laintiff, it appeared, is stud groom to a gentleman named berts, residing in Kent, and in March last he had an entire horse called Sandhurst to sell, and advertised him for sale in Be7ls L.ife. The defendant, who is a farmer at Fouchers, Good Easter, near Chelmaford, saw this advertisement, and answered it, and this led to a correspondence between him and a Mr. White, of the Talbot Lnn at Market farborough, near Leicester, in which he agreed to purchase the horse for 801., and pay for his sending up to town in a horsebox. The laintiff went down to Fouchers, Good Baster, to see the defendant, and the defendant then for the first time learnt that he was the owner of the horse; and having heard that a friend of his bad bought a horse fromastrangerwhichturnedout to be stolen, and that he had afterwards to return it to the owner, and thus lost his money and the horse, he resolved to be cautious, and entirely rescinded his contract entered into with White, to which, according to the defendant's eidence the plaintiff agreed. The defendant then entered into a fresa contract for the purhase of the horse on the former terms fromthe plaintig stipulating that the plaintiff should give a satidactory reference as to the horse, and also that he should pay for the horse by his check. He did so because his banker, Mar. Round, of Chelmsford, told him that if the plaintff was an honest man he might object to the check, but, If not, he would be sure to object. The plaintiffs account was that he never agreed to be paid by check. On the defendant coming to town for the horse he found it at a stables, the plaintiff not being there, and the groom refused to take his chech by the plaintiff's orders. The defendant's susplcions were thereupon confirmed, and he refused to have anything more to do with the horse. The horse was afterwards sold at Tattersall's for 461., and the defendant bought him there. On the application of the learned counsel for the defendant, his Lordshp assented to a plea being added to the record that the contract was rescinded. His LoRDs}iIp, on the evidence as to the first issue of ton assumpsU, that the defendant believed he was contracting with White, and not with the plaintiff, directed the jury to find for the defendant; and, wiith respect to the plea whether the contract was rescmded, left the facts to the jUry The jury retired, and found, on their return, a verdict for the defendant.
, COURT OF EXCEHEQUER, TUESDAY. JUNE 16. PEVlDNE CAUSE. lo<wzC"y c.Ly mrtnzuS, beJorc Oie UHrEF BARON and a SPecid Jurv.1 *;Ar1UK1NYY-aGENE3L V. ALFRED ALLE. The Solicitor-General, Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Wilde, and Mr. Beavan were counsel for the Crown; Mr. Collier and Mr. Joseph Brown appeared for the defendant. This was an information containing 30 counts, charging the defendant with penaities to the extent of 375,0001., for various.4lleged infractions of the Excise laws in relation to his business of a malster. It appears that the defendant has for many years carried on the malting trade in Sussex, and that in April last he occupied three extensive maltin premises at Worthing, Mulsey, and Horsham. On the 3d of April the officers engaged in the survey of the first named premises observed certain appearances of a sQspicious character in the malt then in the course of working. The malt had evidently been pressed dewn by feet in order to present a gauge unfair to the revenue, and the bulk appeared to be composed of barley which had germinated unequally. These circumstances led to a strict examination of the premises, and in the course of their search the officers discovered a trapdoor door opening into anunderground passage, at the end of which were two vaults completely fitted up with malting cisterns and conch frames of A capadty nearly equal to those above which had been regularly entered. It further appeared that the cisterns bore marks of having been recently and continuously used, the means of supDlying them with barley and water being afforded by secret shoots and pipes commaunicating with the upgr premises. No sooner was this discovery made at Worthing than the officers visted the premises at Mulsey and Horshe=n, in each of which precsely inmilar contrivances were speedily found out, thus affording conclusive evidence that the defendant had cariied on an iUicit trade concurrently with a leal$ one at each place, and with the opportunity of doing so to an enormous extent. In order to arrive at an approximation on this subject, it was now sbown tiat on the 3d of July certain drawbacks were paid to the defendant on his existing stock, and that the guantity of malt which had been surveyed between that period and the 3edof Apt had been exceeded by his sales to customers to tne extent of about 7,000 bushels, so that the inference was that he had used his ilicit premises to that extent at all eyents. It need hardly be stated that all the malt and barl found on the several premises was seized, snd that proceed. ings were instituted both to recover penalties for using unentered premnises and irregularly working those which had bsen entered, as well as to recover the treble value of th malt seized, snd to bring about its cendemunation. MKr. CoLLIE, in addreesingthe-.jury .for the defendant, felt biound to admit that the cae agaist his client had been abundantly proved bv the Crown, and the only qeaoin he would put to the jury ws to the extent to wbich the verdict ought to go.

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, June 16. OLD COURT. (Before thew REORDE) Edward Craufard, 23, a respectable-looking young man, was indicted for stealing four watches, the property of Charles Augustus Dave. Mr. Psyne conducted the prosecution; Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the prisoner. Mrs. Johanna Dnive, the wife of the prosecutor, deposed that her husband carried on the business of a watchmaker, In Maddox-street, Regent-streeb, and on the evening of the 11th of May, about half-past 8 o'clock, she was in the shop with her sons, when a man, who she had no doubt was the prisoner, came in and asked to be allowed to see a cae of watches that was in the window. She took out the case and showed it to the man, and her suspicions were excited by his taking the case from her, and she in consequence went round the counter and stood by him. The man then took up the watches separately, and examined them and lnq.uired the price, and while he was so engsed another man opened the shop door and exclaimed, "What, ho " Atthis time the case of watches was in her hand, but the moment the exclamation was made he snatched. the case frbm her and ran out of the shop with it; but at theamoment he made the snatch she struck him on the wrist, and the blow had the effect of jerking two of the watches out of the case, and they fell or the floor of the shop, bit the prisonr 'got away with the other four. She immediately gave information to the police of the robbery and described the person by whom it had been committed, and the prisoner was brought to the shop a few days afterwards and she at onco identified him. This witness was cross-examined by Ifr. M=cAXXs as to the opportunity she had of observing the prisoner, and sh' sated that he was in the shop for at least 10 minutes, snd that his conduct excited her suspicion and induced her to take more particular notice of him, and she was quite sure was the man. The son of the prosecutor, a lad 12 yenrs of age, who was in the shop at the time the robbery was committed, Also swore positively that the prisoner was the man. Mr. DTCALF addressed the jury on behalf of the p,soner, and said that the defence he was instructed' to set up for him was that the witnesses for the prosecution weremistaken in speaking to his Identity, and that, in point of fact, he was not the guilty party. A man named James Blissett was then called asa witness for the defence, and he swore that on the evening of the 11th of May he was with the prisoner, his father, and a Iman' named Roper, at a publiechouse in Church-street; Soho, at half-past 6 o'clock, and remained there for an hour and a half; and that they then went together to another publichouse, where ther were for more than an hour, and then they all went back to the former publichouse, where he had to meet his wife by appointment. He also said he was suite sue that this occurred on the Uth of May, because it was the anniversary of his vwedding. In cross-examination the witness said he had known the prisoner four or five years, but did not know where he lived. He sid he had lost sight of him for 17or18 months, and he was told by a wvoman who kept compaty vrith him that "something unpleasant" had happened to the prisoner. Mrs. Blissett, the wife of the last witness, and a person named Roper, were %lso examined, and they swore that the prisoner was m their company the whole of the evening of the robbery. Jonathan Blissett. the father of the first witness, was next examined, and he gave similarevidence,:but with this important contradiction, that he represented that Mr Bhssett was present the whole time. None of the witnesses were able to state where the prisoner lived, or to give any information respecting him or the msaner in which he got his livig Mr. PAns replied, andapointed out to the jury the di&. crepances and the contrdictions in the evidence b7 which the alibi was sought to be supported, and he sad it ap,peard to him thatthe defence was as impudent as the robberyitself, and that the witnesass for the defence had attepte tomiseadand deceive the jury, and that there ano truth in the story told by them. The ReCRDER sunmmed up the whol'e case with great.fairness and impartiality, but lie observed, if there was any truth in the defence, it was ather extraordinary ihat nothing of the kdnd sould hive been siuggeo;p,d w; # prisoner wa under examintl*a befort t mg , a that the alilishould be ot ua oWIly wa .*pon his trial who therswas, of ours%e no pottrudy o . makinquirie with a vier to wa etlmh" ab,e wasanytrath -the story told by the witneses.

She was found Guilty, and, evidenoe of for. mner convictions having been given, The COUPT sentenced her to four year penal servitude. On hearing the sentenoe the prisoner, a determined looking woman, feUll upon her knees, and in an instant took a dlk Ihandkerchief from her pocket and twistd it round her neck, pulling the ends with all her strength, apparently with the object of strangling herself The officers at once seized ber by the arms and compelled her to loose her hold upon the handkerchief and, having removed her to a call, handoufs were pbced upozL her to prevent any further attempt. Richard Shaw, 56 and John Edward; alias Martin, stated to be a pugilist, were indicted-for stealing- purse containing a check for 51. 4s. ld., two sovereigns, &c., from the person of Wiliam Verry. Edwards wap further indicted for unlawfully frequenting a place of* public resort, the Eastern Counties Railway terminus at Shoreditch, with intent to commit felony. Mr. Meotcle appeared for the prosecution, unstructed by Mr. Ashley for the railway company. On the 2d inst. prosecutor, a builder, 52 and 53, Great Tower-streetk, went to the Shoreditch terminus to proceed to Loughton, and between the time of his taking his ticket and entering the carriae his purse was abstzacted froi his pocket. The prisoner had been watehed by constables in the employment of the oompany loitering about the station, and Shaw was taken into custody on another charge, hen the prosecator's purse was found in his pi-sessiogn He was taxen to the office of the superintendent of the police, who noticed that he was chewing something and asked him what it wa. He replied, "Tobacco." The superintendent took hold of him by the throat, and after some dii'iculty forced from his mouth apiece of ppepr, which p roved to be a check for 5h. 4s. ld., drawn upon Glyn, Hlifax, and Co., which was in the prosecutor's purse when it was stolen from his pocket. The evidence of the con. stables proved beyond doubt that the prisoners were acting in concert. The jury found both Guilty. Bdwards, who had been previously convicted (his last sentence was 12 months), was sentenced to four year' penal servitude; Shaw to hard labour for one year. Richard Manning, 25, butcher, was indicted for hming stolen 16 sheep, value 32h, the property of George Betts. 1 lr. Orridge appeared for the prosecution; 3Mr. Metcalfe, instructed byMr. lWontner, appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor was a sheep salesman living at Tilbury and on the 8th inst. he had 16 sheep in a pen in the Ne; ;Metro olitar Market, which the prisoner agreed to buy at 38s. 6d.each. He asked the prosecutor where, according to the cpstom of the market, the money was to be paid, and he replied at Hill's, where he kept his market accounts; tho bhrge being on the common understanding, the prosector s,i that the money must be paid before the shee were removed. Theprisoner bought them in the name of Whelan, and, the bargain having been strack, he got into the pen and marked the sheep with red cchre, by which other buyers would Inow that they were sold. The sheep vere left int the care of a drover named Thompson, who went away for about three minutes at 1 o'dock, to get a glass of beer, and when he returned the sheep were gone, and upon inquiry st Hif's,-it lwas ascertained that no money had been paid iD. respect of them. An immediate investigation took place, the result of which was that the prosecutor went to Newgate-market, and found that the sheep had been disposed of by the prisoner in two lots-one of U and one of 5-to slaughtermen, fromoneof whom he received 101. on account. This he did in his own name. When he was taken into custody ihe said, wlien informed of the nature of the charge, that he knew nothing of any 16 sheep, but afterwards l saidbhe bought them, and sold them to a butcher whom be did not know. The prosecutor, in cross-examination, said if the money had been paid in at his agent's of course no complaint would acquainted withe the maurkweat,the prisoner must have known that, according to the custom of dealing, he would have no rgrhCt tore mOoeve the sheep until he had actually paid the Mtr. MXToAz, submitted that there was no case to go to ?rhe A.SSISVTATJUnGE said he thought there was, as it al3peared that the prosecutor had no intention of parting with legal possession ofthe sheep tnl the condition of paying the money to the agent had n fulfilled.

The AssisTAr-Junon.-But he inquired where he wa# to pay the money-those were hia own words, showing his knowledge of the custom. Mr. funroAm further submitted that when the brpin was struck the prisoner committed an act of ownerhip upon the sheep by marking them, and he had aright to take them away. the mark indicated that they were sold. to some one, and it was by the prisoner's own mark that the skins were subeequently identified. The case for the prosecution was to make the prisoner responsible for a custom without showing that hs knew of it.

Mr. RoBhesoN then, on behalf of the defendant, bged to correct an erroneous imepresson that had gonae wrth in the upceport, that his client wa the French master of St. w1av hoe oingL Such was likely to do Some i-nju uniess ontradiected, Mr. Dupuis being only one of thet nssi9tant English masters ; but he should show him to be one of. the miost humane men in this me tro and ab gentleman not likely to use undue severiytowhrdo tanyof the 4scholars under his care. He contended that the charge was got up in the heat of passion. and through maliee by the mother, who in doing so was attempting to hold up the defendant to public execration. He (Mr. Robinson) did not believe there was a single bishop or judge on thle bench who had not been more severely flogged in school than the lad in qestion, end he had no doubt his learrned brethreni azround him, as well as many oth4)rs lie saw in court, had been more severely dealt with by those who had charge of their education, and had snffered more, than this lad, who appeared before them in his mildest form. He. however, should be able to show by numerous witnesses that he had several times been guilty of petty rebellion in the school, and that it was necessary his misconduct should be 'stopped. If there had been any wanton cruelty practised, he for one should be glad to seo the perpetrator punished; but could the jury say there was anything of the kind in this case ? There vwas a number of witnesses whom he would caU for the defence, and whose evidence would upset that of the prosecution, if the jury considered that he had any occasion to trouble them further. The CHiAmssAx then put it to the jury as to whether they wished to hear witnesses for the defence ? The jury consulted for a few moments, and said they 'were perfectly satisfied with the evidence they had heard. The xound tne defendant Not Guilty. The CsrAm said he quite agreed in their verdict. If they had found the gentleman guilty no personal chastise. ment could have been inficted in Echools.
POLICE. GUILDHALL.-Mr. Craw&hy, of the Iron-wharf, Georgevard, Thames-atreet, was aumnmoned before Alderman 3IDNZY for refusing to pay 191. 5s., the amount of a churchnate assessed upon his wbarf and premises. Mr. Miller, the collector, produced the ratebook, and said that the premises were assessed in five portions at the zate of 6d. in the pound. Alderman SIDNEY, after inspecting the ratebnok, said, this rate appeared to be raised for the puspo of the repair and amendment of the churoh of St. M=ay Somerset, and the sum required was 921. But he wished to know if that rate was made in open vestry, and if the majority of the vestry in attendance assented to it? Mlr. Miller said, there was only one dissentient, and that vas a 3ir. Chambers, and the names of all who attended were entered on the minutes. The defendant objected to the rate as excessive, and that it was levied for purpoees for which it could not be law. Rully applied. He also ssid the rate was bad on the face of it, as it was not signed by a majority of the churchwardens as well as a majority of the inhabitants. Mr. Miller said that two churchwardens might be elected, but one alone might act. Alderman SIDNEY said he knew the practice with many parishes was for one ohurchwarden only to be sworn to act. Mr. Miller admitted that only one churchwarden acted in this parish; but he submitted that the law also only required a majority of the inhabitants to assent to c rate to render it legal. The defendant contended that there must be a majority of the churchwardens, and one of two was not a majority. Mr. Martin (the Chief Clerk) advised the magistrate that his jurisdiction was removed by the defendant objecting to the validity of the rate. Alderman SiDNEY said he was aware that when the validity of a rate was disputed it then became a question for an ecclesistical court, but he thought the objection to only one churchwarden could never be sustained. With regard to the lawful application of the rate, ho considered the in'habitants could legally agree to tax themselves for any idi. ,dental expnsa MIr. M slaid the salary of the organist was one of the items objected to, and he had only 51. per year. Alderman Srns-EY aid he did not kow upon what ground the rate was alleged to be excessive, but he thought the expense of disputing the validity of the rate would be much greate than the loss by paying it. The acting ohurchwarden said, as to the rate being excesmve, it would not produce more than sufficient to cover about a third of the necessary repars. The church would hold aboutffOO person, and the lesst possible expense was incureed in repairs, in the expectation that it would be one of the hrches vthat would be pulled down iin a year or two. Alderman SiDnmr said an attempt had been made to repair the oburoh at Lsyton on the voluntary principle, but the collection was so inuuficient that the inhabitants were obliged to levy a 3s. rate. Mr. Miller said Mr. (rawshay had paid this rate for 15 years witheut objection. A formal notice was then put in by the defendant, stating that he disputed the validity of the rate, and the summons was dismissed. MARLEORBouaH0SpRyLr.O'Tohomas Douglas was charged with embezzlement. John Fletcher, tassau-street, baker, said the prisoner mas in his employ. He had found out that the prisoner had received money from customers, and had not accounted to him for it. There were numerous casas, ann therefore further time W7as IIMMary .Remanded till Monday. WxsTysuxysNT.-Sarah Ann Ratdiffe, a girl only 17 years of age, was finaly examined, chnaged with stealing a quantity of miscelaneous property from the house of her master, Captain Stevens, 44, Stanley-street, Pimlico. Prisoner entered the service on the 24 inst., sad on the morning of the 6th, having had the keys given to her to get the breakfast ready, she suddenly absconded, taking with her a pair of blankets, a pair of sheets, a quantity of clothing, a milk jug with the captain'S crest upon it, and other articles, which sbe pawned in one hNuge handiesat hoalf-paat 7 in the morning, at the shop of Alr. Soames, in the Fulham-road, for 21., and was subsequently apprehended at Knightsbridge. On the first examination Mr. Arnold desired that Mr. Soames might ba requested to attend personally yesterday, when on bi doipg Bo tho wortlby magistrato remarked that he bad sent for him to acquaint him vith the grossly improper conduce o2 his asslatant in taklig in from so yo s a *Pero.1 asthe prisoner such a qonity of property iithout m g proper inquiries, lIe (Dr. rold) begged to say that this Was no; the way the bess of a pawn roker oght to be conducted, as it was realy and posiivels giving every - dhnoe to peOnS to disposaof stolen property, and if the busines ware-to be condued a pawnbrker should pn ovor his door, " Itolen prt en in here, and o ques. tions asked." e hoped that ,rr. Soames would feel with ,him that it the assisat remained nis employment he must conduct hbmself ver differently for the future, for if he did not LL-. Uoames wold have hi3 name nmentioned in a very unpiessa way. 3ffr. Soamjies said at he ad questioned his assistant, who had given him a-. different verion of the CeAse. HEo (Mr. Soames) had during a-period of 25 yeats done his best to ccnduct his establishment with every regar to integrity, Ms the unfrequenoy of complaints againstm at that court would amply testW;y and be had 'made it bib business directly the matter came to his knowledge to go to the captain and inform him that he had got his property; and in reply to an obeervation made by the prosecutor on the last examination, that he had at first refused to show him the things, he begged to say ho did so because the captain demanded instant restoration, and because he (Mr. 8oames) thought that justice demanded the punishment of the owender, snd that it would be prudent to withhold the prodaction oL the things until the examination at a policecourt. Be could produce a resecable woman to prove thae the prisoner said sho wanted to make up 2g.b that th goods were her own, and kept adding to the things on the counter untilashe left suffocient to raiserthe cmount. He however considered that his assistant had been grossly in error. Milr. AR2s0D observed that on the prevrous examination the assistant had not admitted so much had bena said at the time of pawning. He (the wvorthy magistrate) must still Say that no person exercisinsg ordinary common usens would have done what the assistant had been guilty ofS It wvas thef60ilityggiven to dispose of stolen .propccrtg byvmerely puttiDng common-place questions that he complamied of. if the questions were put in a prudent and proper way a t check was placed upon dishonesty. The assstant oughit to have detained both the property and the prisoner, and asn n very unfit person to have eontrol in a pawnubroker's estblishment. Or. Soames said, his man had been guilty of gross imprudence, and Intimcated that upon a repetition of it he wonld be dismissed his service. The prisoner having pgleded guilty, and it having been stated that she had hitherto borne a vsery good chaacter, shq wa8 sentenced to two months' hard labcour. Woasge r-amura r.dtohn Berry, a greengrocer in the Hackney-road, was charged writh robberg, and an elderly woman named Hanah Fordham p as charged waith receiving the property with a guSty knowledge. A yMrs. Ellen aardiman, the wife of astationer in larionsquare, hackney, vasnanxious to surprise her husband wish a gage d'amourt and therefore one day last week cvlled unon Mr. ArTes, a jeweller in the neighbourhood, and gave h.im an order for a handsomne scarf-pin.the pattern of which she selectd. The pin was finished and sent home on Friday evening, and the next night, as the family were removiDg, the prosecutor handed his scarf to his wife, who thrust the pin into a rapper UpOin a table, to prevent Its being lost. The pin altogether wacs four inehes long, and was so woven into the wrapper tha t maouid not have fallen out, but directly ate w s missed, and ad evidently been stolen. Ogn Monday the female prisoner called upon Ir. Arhes with a neck-pin broken to pietes, asked imeif ita sgold, aud offered toseli it. foemwras struck with the pattern, put the pieces tgether, and then, seeing it was the pin he haii only just made for the prceector, detained it and the womean, and sent for the polie Te constable Higgins knew that her son eas associate of Berry, and as Berry had been employed by Elardimanto remove his Boods heit for ten alseo; and the woman then acknoeedgd as chad received the stolen property from her son, who must have had it from Berry. Berry, on this, acknow ledged that that s the fact, aud declare t he had picked it up loose from the floor; but this w as refuted by the prosecutor and his wrife; and The female prisoner was therefore admitted to bail, and Berry committed for the completion of the evidence, SOUTHWAnK-WjIIiam Goddard, a respectable-looking man, was charged with embezsling various sums of money received for and on account of his master, lr.

A police constable -of thie L division deposed that about I o'clock out that morning he found the prisoner ringing the bell at the residence of the Rlev. J)r, Doyle, which adjoins the Catholic Cathedral, and on speaking to her he folund that she was in a state of intoxication. He dedred her to go about her business, but she refuned to do so, and insisted on seeing the rev, gentleman. Magistrate..Well, prisoner, what have you to say to this charge of being drunk and ringing the ball of Mr. Doyle ? Pzisoner.-Wfell, all I can say is that I wanted to see him. Magistrate.-What I at 1 o'clock in the morning? It ap rs you have been here before for similarmisconduct. thk, egaoler.-Yes, Sir. She has not been many days out of prion, where she was committed for making use of threats to and annoying Dr. Doyle. Magistrate.-Thig sOrt of conduct cannot be permitted, and for it you must pay a penalty of 40s. or be imprisoned for one month.
TO THE EDITOlROF THE TIiI:ES Sir,-I trust, for the sake of humanity, that you will insert this letter in your paper. I saw a few days ago an extract from the delbourne Argus, giving an account of the murder of Inspector-General Price by a number of convicts at Williamstown. I have since seen an account of their trial, conviction, and sentence, and no doubt by this time they have been execated. I knew Mr. Price wel; he was police magistratefor years in Hobart. town, and I believe that a more unjust, merciless man-one less fit to have the management of prisoners-could not be found in the penal colony. While in Van Diemen's Land I saw the Sydney Herald; It contained an account of the state of Norfolk Island, of which Mr. Price was the commandant. A correspondent of the Sydney Hcrald, in an interesting and apparently authentic communication upon the late riot, discloses this dreadful fact. To add to this unhappy state of affairs, a resident polioe magistrate had been appointed from VUn Diemen's Land, who very soon rendered himself an object of vengeance. The flogging became perfectly ftrious; from 500 to 2,000 lashes were indicted in a morning, until the ground about the triangle Ws literaily soaked v:'b blood. I wil' venture to say that, from my knowledge . che man and the system, these terrible punishments were unneces. sary. One of the regulations at Norfolk Island and Port Arthur was that after the ringing of a bell no voice should be heard in any hut. A ship from England arrived at Norfolk Island. Some of the prisoners were sent on board; on their return to the hut they were teling their companions the news which they picked up from the crew, The watchman, hearing voioes, commanded silence in a most authoritative nanner. Not being instantly obeyed, he rushed into the hut and attempted to drag some of the men to the cells. They refused to go, declaring that they were asleep. The next day all the men in the hut were brought before Price, and every man sentenced to receive 100 lashes. 3,000 lashes were inflicted on that occasion. Why, Sir, is so much human misery inflicted? 'Unless a man has been shut out from the world for years, he cannot estimate the feelings of those who, under such circumstanoe,, are anxious to obtain somne mformation connected, in many cases, with their own fate. MIuch attention and long experwence in the colony convinced me that the far greater part of the punishments had no other tendency than to degrade, to debase, and to brutify those subject to them. I remain. Sir vnr l ; o JOHN FROST. btapLeton, June 15. -

RESTORATION OF OLD GBZYFBIARS, EDINBURGH. -On Sunday lat the restored pariah church of Old Greyfiiars, Edinburgh, was opened for public worship, after an interval of 12I years. The church, which was erected in 1614, is a Gothic edifice, and strikingly illustrative of the decline of ecclesiastical art that followed the Reformation in Scotland, as that of Trinity Colleges built about 1460, takln down for the railway station in 1648,- and still unrestored, was an example -of the height to which it had attained. Old Greyfiars was therefore a build ing of.lnterest chiefly from hassociations whicbh connected its early history with the covenanting strug&lea of the 17th oentury, aind the vcissitudes of ecclesiastical rule in Scotland during the reigns of the two Charleses Its restoration, nevertheless, poasesses several points of esthetic interest, and indicates, even under the rigid rule of Presbyterianism, a considerable advance in some reWects in ecclesiastical decoration. The -church was cdentally burnt. down in January, 1815, the walls alone remalning; and, though restored outwardly on the saine model, it still exhibits some improvement. In the interior a complete change has been effected. The gal. leries and -li rshave been removed, and the entire are, opened up like a large hall, spanned by an oaken roof. The windows (nine in number) have been filled in with stauined glas, being amost the first appearance of this ornanent in the parish churches of Scotland, although Glasgow Cathodr1l(which is one of the parish churches of that citv) will shortly exh{bit this novel feature in a still more mcent manner. The central window is erected by the congregation, andillustratesseveralof the parables. The otherwindows have been privately gifted to the church, and are intended as memorials of Scotch worthies and former pastors. A very interesting window commemorates the Reformer, George Buchanan; anotber the Covenanter, Robert Trail - a third the bistorian, William Robertson ; and the others serve to perpetuate the memory of Dr. Erskine, Dr. Finlayson, Dr. Inglis, and Dr. Anderson, eminent ministers who have served in the cure of the parish. Among the contribators to the beautifying of the church are Mr. James Buchanan lr. Anthony Trail, Principal Lee, Ur. Inglis, Dean of Faculty, &c., who each contribute a memorial window; while lord Bronham unites with the Earl of Minto, Mr.' John Russell, an other descendants of the historian Ro. bertson, in the memorial to him. The church is now attended by a large congregation under the able pasturate of the Rev. Dr. Robert Lee, who is also a Professor in the lUniversity of Edinburgh. MAmNSION-w OSE.-Yesterday evening the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress entertained the Archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops, and a distinguished party of the metropolitan clergy at a banquet in the Egyptian-hall. Covers were laid for 250 guesta. Among those resent and included in the loving cup were:-The Archbishop of Canterbury and hmr. Thomas, the Bishop of Lon. don and Mfrs.

Grace havingbeen sidbythe mostrev. the Archbishop, and the cloth drawn, the Lord Mayor gave the usual loyal toasts, which were duly honoured. His Lordship next proposed "His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, and rrosperity to the Society for the Propaption of the Gospel in Foreign Parts." His Grace, in reply, was understood to thank his Lordship for coupling his name with that of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, of which society he had the honour of being the president. That day was the anniversary of that blessed institution, which had proved itself not only of the greatest service to the Church of England, but most efficacious in the spread of the holy Gospel throughout the world. The toast of "The Army and Navy" was briefly responded to by Colonel LIke and Admiral Sir Stephen Lushington. The Bishop of London, in returning thanks for "The Bench of Bishops," with which his name was joined, said it was a remarkable sign of the times in which they hved that those who held their holy office were now in the prosecution of their missionary work made welcomre and gladly received in the lowest and most degraded parts of that metropolis. It was encouraging also to find that the value and importance of their labours were recognized by their municipal authorities, for if they could not succeed withont the aid of their brethren clergy, they certainly could not succeed without the countenance and sanction of their brethren laity, especially of the right hon. gentleman in the chair, to whose exertions both in town and conntry tney were so deeply indebted. To this working union of the clergy and laity the usefulness of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was owing. It formed an outward and visible emblem of that union between Church and State which was so beneficent in its resalts, He spoke not of the politicaluhion. but of that union of parts which formed a bored among those who laboured together in the cause of the Gos- el, and which made all in this country allow that the rhurch of England was indeed a most valuable and working institution. (Hear. hear) "The Health of the Bishop of Salisbury," "1The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress," and other toasts of the usual complimentarr charcter followed, and were cordially acknowledged. The company separated at an early hour of the eveninz. The musical proRramme was excellent, and Mr. Percival Watts's performance on the concertina elicited marked applause. - By a misDrint the time of the Rev. Dr. Steinkopf's holding the ministerial office at the Savoy was stated X9 65pears. It ought to have bee; 55 ya.

Mr. Fryer rowed the sculls in his boat c4pitally, but he and him party were for a time, although well oft in station, much hampered by the amount of crft in their course, and the 3esss. Davis held way with them excellently through Vauxhallbridge, where MeS. Colquhoun, Pryer, and Willoughby were still leading slightly. Off Smith's disillery, at the upper end of Thamee. bank, BoviUe, who wasrowlng the labour forard, began to overlap the leading boat, and avery tnrtea and caitd race followed, Mr. Colphoun's party holding them wel for some time, and remindlig one of the great raes of bygone days.

BAxLoox Asc=T.-PLr oum, Tuesday Evening. -By Electric Telegraph.)-The balloon which left North Woolwich at half-past 11 traversed a distance of about 230 miles, and descended at Tavistock at half-past 4 this morning. It did not ascend to any get heighS, ma was distinctly oeen between Exeter and Newton y the guard and passengers of the mail train which left Exeter at 3 50 am., by the driver of the goods train which leaves at 3 57, and by the railway porters of the Newton sttion. The three aeronauta breakfatted at T%vistook. Mr. YournnS reached Ply outh in time to leave by the express train at 1040, arriving at Paddington at 6 in the afternoon. Mr. Coxwell and his friend left at 5 lo p.m., and would arrive at 4 50 on Wednesday morning. The balloon has gone on by luggage train at 7 this evening. SOCtY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THE Gosprx iN FOREIGN PARTS.-Yesterday afternoon the 156th anniver. sary of this society was celebrated by divine service with a full choir at St Paul's Cathedral. The Bishop of Winches. ter represented the Archbishop of Canterbury the president of the society, who had to attend at Bckinghamn Palace to ba ptize the young Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore. The Bisho of incheser was accompanied by the Bishops of Manchestr, St. Asaph, and Sodor and Man, the Dean of st. Lauls, nd a large number of the clergy. There was a vast congregation, many of whom were ladies. The Lord Mayor and the Sherif, Messrs. Mechi and Kests, arrived at the cathedral in state. After anthems had been sung bythe full choir, and prayers and lessons had been read, the Bishop of Salisbury preached sermon from the 6th verse of the 22d chapter of Joshua,"So Joshua bles6ed them and sent them away." In his discourse the Bishop adverted in eloquent terms to the valiant and entetprising spirit which had in. duced missionaries to to foreign lands to preach the Gospel, and to the success which had attended their valuable labours under all kinds of discouragement. Oar church, he said, wuas prospering in the colonies. The reports from India were more and more cheering year after year. Africa, too, afforded evidence of the power of the ministra. tion of the Word and the Sacraments. In the concluding portion of his sermon the Bishop said thst our missions were giving back to us more than they received. If any one asked whether such an assodation as the one he was then speaking of deserved support, he would advise them to seek their answer from the colonies, from India, and, above all, from America. But it was almost an universal concession that there never yet had been a more faithful helper in the mission field thban that noble assoiation which was incorpo. rated by charter on that very day of the month, A.D. 170L After an earnest appeal to the congregation to contribute largely to the funds of the society, the Right Rev. Prelate observed that the increasd suppott of the foreign missions of the church would he an earnest of increased and increasing zal for the salvition of our brethren at home. The service concluded by Handels anthem of " Halelujah."I A CmrirAs's AccouNT OF HIS CAnxx.-Hero is his own version of a criminal's career in crime and its attendantvices, as detailed by himself on his way to St. ugustine's (Canterbury) Gaol:-" My nameisnot Thomas, nor do I belong to Sittingbourne. I was not such a flat as to tell your superintendent who I W *and where I came from. But it doesn't matter now. He said he thought I was a ticket-of-leave man; so did another gentleman say so to-day. They were not far out. Iam a native of Devonshire A few years ago, with a companion, I committed a highway robbery on a gentleman. I stole 1001. from him. I managed to give my companion the slip, and then hid 98 sovereigns in the hollow of a tree near by. We then went to a beerhouse and got drinking. My companion wanted me to share the money, but I put him off. He got suspi. dons, however, and went out and got two police-officers, and ' split,' and they carne and took me fito custody. They found on me 11. 10s. in gold and some silver. This man turned Queen's evidence, and gave evidence against me, I was convicted, and sentenced to sevenyears'trans. portation. The judge wanted me to tell where the monev was, but Imknew they would not give me any more if *[ didn't tell, IoI wouldn't tell 'em. I served four yeas, and then got a ticket of leave and 14b 14s. from the Go. vernment. I had a good spree until the money was all gone. Ithenmadothebe5tofmywaydowntowherelput the 98 sovereigns, and there I found them, as I had left them, in the hollow of the tree. I had a joll-good spree as long as it lauted. I have since been a soldier, and also in the navy, but whether they want me again or not Idon't know, nor do I care." The following is the description of this prisoner; it may lead, perhaps (with the above particulars), to his identification elsewhere:-He is a short thickset man, about oft. 6in. in height, with round, full sunburnt face, and thick neck, thick hair at the sides, butvery thin on the top; has the appearance of having been at sea. -uo-Eastern Gazette.
