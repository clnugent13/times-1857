British Policy In Central Asia.
BfrITISH POLICY IN COEXT.Z:L -rt. ;
(FROM A CORRX5POND:ET3)
-L&EEOREri, ls.23.| Theo interview between Sir John Lawrencei and flotI Mahomed stil forms the chief tOPi6Of interest in the PL. I jab. ThO result of that interview bas not beeuformally an. nounced, hat tbobargain struck was, I believe, iotn
more or'less than this t-Dost Mahomea lndertakes toff;ht the battle with Persia in Horat and Affghanistan and wev undertake to furm;sh him with 120j000L per annutn no lont as the war lasts. Part of the subsidy, in the first inatanee, is-to consub of muskets and other munitions of war. Throo English officers, the two lumsdens and Dr. Coxe, goto Aiffghanistsnbto watch the distribution of th sulbsidy-in. other words, to see that we get our money's worth. -Of cotare, this arrangementis the subject of very severe crit. cism. It is said that with an embarssed exchequer weare deliberately throwing away 12 laos a-year on an ally Wh6a capacity to serve us, if honest, is doubtful, nd-onW wohe honesty, if onco opposed to his interest, no one pro. fesscs to depend. We are not only wssting the money, we a s sowing dragoDs' teett; putting arus into the hands of those -who never can be real friends, and who have been, and may well be. again, oiurdeadly enemies. If we are to meddle with Central A"a atiIl let us do tho work weU ourselves-not pay others to do it ill; which means, let as send a British force into Affghanistan, or wherever else events may lead.
Now, it is just the converse of this argument -which, in my opinion, justifies the treaty made with Do,at Maomed, It is all very wull to talk of tho wila sea of Asiatic politics, and say that the fate of Herat is nothing to -s
There is no doubt of two things-first, that Herat is a moat. importnt point strategically; secondly, that we are bound -wisely or unwisely-by treaty to resent an attack on it by Persia. The question is, then, how is this engagement to be met, since meet it we must? ShaU we go to Herat ourselves, or Pay others to go? Now, I fancy that no Government, still less the astuto Governor of the Pnujab. supposes that w- shall get a direct equivalent for our 120,000Z. a-year; but if the Government considers that this is a cheap price, to py in order to avoid sending a British force through the westerii passes I think they judge wiely. There is no disisinz the fact that there is a party in India vwhich wouold ueth
fatal policy. It will be redsted by the preseribG o,eru. ment, but it cannot be too promptly and. too energeticauy condemned. Every argument against such a course i as strong or stronger than ever.
To place between ourselves and our own frontier a friend whom the slightest shadow of disaster would convert into a foe-toabandonan admirable defensive lne for an attack beset by enormous dangers and difficulties-bovwithdraw from all Indiathe protecting shadow of the army-to cripple an embarassed finance by sending a force to a country where every cannon-shot wil be worth its weight in silverwould be an act of such utter insanity, so surely to be fol. lowed by frightfalconsequenoes, that the Government does. well to pay the price it does to avoid so horrible a nees. sity.
Meanwhile the true antagonists of Russian and Persian designs are not inactive. The prospectus of the Pnnjab' ,Railway has just been published. Mr. Brunton and his i staff reached Lahore in November, and their surveying opo-
rations will, I believe, have been completed by the end of the cold season, that is, by ApriL The line is to rn from rAmritsir to lAhorm, and thence to Moult AtAritsrit will touch the trunk line from Calcutta to Peshawur; at Moultan it will join the Scinde Railway to Kurrachee. Ths it will bo the great-rtery of traffic between the north-.est of India and England.
Of the facility of making such a railway no person who has folowed the dry level ridge which forus the watershed between the Sntlej and the Ravoe can have a doubt; nor can its importance be denied by those who have seen with regret the splendid crops of the Punjab, knowing 'that nature's bounty is the farmer's loss, that the excess of
food, when the loal population has been fed, is a mere wasteful loss, or who has appreciated the fact that the north-west of India is removed from England bya fortnight of unnocessary delay for want of the communication which the Panjab Railway is intended to supply. The capital is to consist of 2,50,0001. in 201. shares, two-fifths of the Z,0ooo shares being allotted to the shareholders of the Soinde Railway Company.
The force on the frontier lives as usual on the gui eive, but the Punjab, like the rest of India, is profoundly tran. quil.
You have probably heard from other sources that Sir Ienry lawrence, late head of the Punjab Government, has accepted the post of Chief Commissioner in Oude.
The officers who accompanied Lieutenant Hand " t ste the Rhyber Pe' are still under arrest, but will probably be soon reased with a reprimand. Poor young and's murderer is, it is saidL, well known, bet it is difficult to get hold of him. The hill tribe to which he belongs is put under the usual ban. Every soul who stirs out of the mountains belonging to that tribe is seized and imprisoned. As the hill people depend on the plain for subdstenoo, they wl be starved out at Lt, give up the criminal, and pay a heavy fine. This is the way in which our wild frontier neighbours aro kept in order.

THE RIVER THAMES.-Yesterday appeared a blue-
TBm Rrvxii THA=s.-Yeaterday appeaed a bluebook containing the copy of a report made to the First Commissioner of Works by Commander Burstal, R.N., on the state of the river Thames between Putney and Rotherhithe, dated the 27th of January, 1857. Theo Commander gives a scientific detail of the changes which have taken place, including the great alteration in the low-water arn face of the Thames above London-bridge, doubtless consequenton the removal of.the old bridgeoinI 82, which,with its large ,starlings," performnaed in a great m uthe part of a dAm to the river, obstructing the free coumrse of the stream. The present low-water surface at springs is at London-bridge 18 feet U inches below the Trinity datum, against 15 feet 4 inches in the year 1-23. At Blackfriarsbridge the difference is that between 1S feet 3 inches And 14 feet 9 inches (1856 and 1823); at Westminster the difference is that between 17 feet 4 inches and 14 feet 5 inches; and at Putney-bridge the difference between 1856 and 1823 is that represented respectively by the figures 14 feet 1 inch (1856) and 12 feet 8 inches (1S23) below Trinity datum. As regards the surface level of highwater, it is found from numerous observations taken betweeen BlackwaU and Putney, when the weather had been long dry, that the tidal wave attained at aU intermediate stations nearly the same level By comparing the time aDd height of high-water at London Docks and Battersea with that of 1823, it appears that in 1856 the timo of highwater at Battersa was 28 minutes later than at the London Docks, and that the surface attained nearly the same level, whereas in 1823 the time was 38 minutes later, and the surface five inches lower. It further appears that the bed of the river has deepened considerably snce 1823, the average deepening at each station between Putney and London-bridge varying from 2 feet to 9 feet 6 inches. Cer. tain deep holes or gnlies near London-bridge have been fi}led up with rubble-stones and cbalk. The greatest change noticeable in theriver bed among the bridges is at Blackfriars and. Westminster, and a strong disposion to the same is evidenced at Southwark. From two cross sections made on the site of the old London-bridge, it appears that the whole of its Piers and foundations have been removed to a level uf 292 feet below Trinity datum, in a line with the centro arch, which corresondis with the depths of the present bridr and as far as lhaUow-wharf above it, aid two foot hSher tham the general depths in the PooL 600 feet below it. From these fatts, sad from the solid riatture of the mnaterial of which the old foundations are composd, it appears evident that the natural scotr of the rxver has been arrsted at andl neat this point, and ooasequently the ssfetpr of the present structur, preerved. Yet the ebb stream Is sO strong in the pool as to cause a small and sufficient scour. The bulk ef the volumo is filled with a series of transverse sections.

The Steamship Oneida.
THB STEAMSHIrP ONBIDA.
TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Bay I crave a corner to say a few words upon $ mubject of deep and painful interest?
Where is Captain Hyde, where is the Oneida, -with her large living freight and her gold ?
All we know is this,-she waS the first homewardvessel for Suezunder the new steam contract. She left King George's Sound on the 4th of February, the correct time, and when the Simla left Galle last March the Oneida had not bei r heard of.
Let Us look at the probable facts. The captain leaves King George's Sound with a notoriously slow vessel (when only under canvass), a very cormorant for fuel to get her along, and then weeU fiUed up with coal.
He would steam away, and would have no doabt a splendid south-east trade. He would thns eater ther tropics within four days. And now comes the doctrine of chanoes. On the course he took he would have no fear of hurricanes, though they would be " in season." If he had an accident from fire, it must be remembered he had plenty of boats, and was supplied with Clifford's lowering apparatus. In that event he would have beeL heard of at Mauritius in some shape before the lstof March. If his engines broke down-and he would try their streng h to make this firs passage,-he could bear up for no other port, with a fair wind, than that island, or he must carry on, and " carry on" George Hyde would, if he had to make a handspiko into a topmast.
Having thus determined, hehadnohelpforit, could expectno assistance, he would crawl pAst the Cocos slands under all the vexations and roasting of that purgatory called thb mniddle passage of the great Indian Ocean. I was there last year about the same time that Captain Hyde would be this year, going up to Galle in a smart sailing vossel (the we11known circle-sailing Constance), in baUast trim, and well managed, and we were exactly 34 days ftom entering the tropics to maldng Point de GaUe. And if Captain Hyde ha; crippled engines, and nothing but his canvass to depend on, at the season, too, of the north-west monsoon, with that big ship almost coal-laden, we may wish him joy of his voyage, but we shall assuredly soon hear of him.
Whatever may have happened to him or his vessel, let nswho have friends on board, and those who are picturing sorrows to themselves and others, bear in mind one factthe Oneida is under the charge of as good a sailor as ever trod a deck, a man of lion heart and cool head. I haveL known him very many years, and I have sailed with hium when his temper, courage, and endurance have nevea oncflnched amidF appalling dangers.
Depen,d non it, we may calm our fears; he will give au aecoeut of himself yet, and all that a man, a brave man, can. do, that George Hyde w;il do. and that *with A -ill"

Sir Charles James Napier.*
SIB CRAlRlES JAMES NAPIEB.*
(Continued from i'he Timet of April 8.)
The life of Sir Charles Napioer really began when tl:e trump of war called him to active service in ,lhe Peninsula. His biographer's narrative is so confused that there is some difficulty in following the hero from place to place and from date to datis in bis various campaigns. It is onough, however, to 4ay that sooii after leaving England, under the command of Sir John Moore, he found himself with his General retreating to Cozrunna. At Corunna it appears that Major Napier's part in the battle "war unobserved, and was mn the despatches unnoticed ;" yet he is said iu effect lo have w,-on the battle, and it is added that if he bad been properly supported the army of the Frenoh 3Ilarshal would have been destroyed. As fate would Lave it, his General was killed, and he whom that Chneral had intended to send to England with the despatches was taken prisoner, desperately wounded. iis sufferings were dreadful-he was robbed of everything-even to that "little locket of hair" -which is said to be a necessary among soldiers, and vhich turns up on the battle field to renind us cf more gentle conquests and of less dangerous wounds. After three months of captivity the Government sent a frigate to ascertain his fate. D E y, cn being informed that his prisoner had an old mnother, now widowed and blind, said, "Let him go then and1 tell her himself that he is alive." The re3ationshil) of Napier to Charles Fox insured the aprroval of Napoleon for this generous deed, and the young soldier returned to his mother. But he relurned under parole not to serve until regularly exchanged, and to bis ardent spirit that modified .estraint was even more galling than actual captivity. He fretted like a child, out of sorts with everything, and with everybody but his mother out of humour. The strange whims and temper of ihis period Sir WVilliam Napier describes by usying that he displayed " an exuberant, lTcuhar humour, rioting like a merry devil In a nun"-a description -which, although very particular is not very precise, but which may be accepted as equivalent to another statement, that it was the humour of Swift without his malignity, exciting laughter without blushes. Amid all his jiritation and forced merry-making Charles Napier had a n-ore modest opinion of himself. "The mass of men are fools and rascals, or fools only, and I am sorry to find myself appertaining to the latter class." As an illustration of this phase of his character, he 'wrote shortly afterwards at the idea of his rejoining the army-" Honour ! Damn honour ! Falstaff is right, by Jove !" The truth is, he was sighing for promotion, and was calling down curses not
ipen his profession, not upon honour, but upon the dispenser of honour, the Commander-in-Chief who 'withheld it. " I want to have a rise out of old Pivot (Sir David Dundas) before he goes to the devil," he said, and when he failed in his expeotations-" May nine millions of rnaledictions alight on old Pivot Davy." He brought all kinds of influence to bear upon this potentate. " If Sir David Dundas sees that people are angry he will give in, for I know he is to be bullied, like all old men." Jiut th.c old man was not to be bullied, and Napier, having by this time been exchanged (much to his disgust) for a couple of nidshipmen, set out for the seat of war as a volunteer, taking his ill-humour along with him. Not even Wellington did he spare, and it was some time before he was able to write, " He is a much J,etter General than I suspected him to be." He cven began to systematize his ill-humour and to eefenditoniprinciple. "The habit of trying to please affects firmness, and a man often says 'Yes' instead of 'No' very foolshly. A fellow comes smirking and smiling with, ' Will you do me the favour of being so kind as to indulge me?' &c., and you are conqutered unless you get out, 'I'll nee you damned first.' That is generally decisive; but if you skirmish with ' Indeed, Sir,' or "Pon my life,' you are done at once." Follovwing such a theory, it is not wonderful that, with his frankness of character, he should soon confess, "I feel myself failXDIg in self-command as to anger."
His companions of this period were not likely to teach him a better example. He had a faney for his cousin, " Black Charles" (the Admiral), -who, like himself, attended the army as a volunteer. " Generally I have no affection for my male cousins; on principle I hate them in a lump; but love-a few female ones in practice." With regard to this particular cousin, however, his opinion was, "Black Charles is a queer fellow as ever crossed 2ne, and as honest a one. He is the delight of my life." As a pleasantexemplification of the manners of the two Charleses, the subject of the present biography quotes wvith great gusto a letter which, after a few weeks of campaigning, the sailor addressed to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and which he evidently regarded as a model of composition. "Sir,-My leave of absence is just out. I don't think it worth remaining here, for I expect you 'will give me a ship, as I am almost tired of campaigning, which is a d- rum concern.---. N." This nautical C. N. had a brother, Tom, and the military C. N. had two brother' serving with the army, so that there was a g_oodly cluster of Napiers atthe seat of war. "The Napiers always get hit; they have had enough of wounds," said Lord Wellington in refusing a Cavadore regiment to Charles, and such accounts are given of the danger to which our hero was exposed that one is ready to answer eagerly in the affirmative the question 'which the eldest born pats, "' Are we cats that we live and bear such 'wounis ?" Charles Napier had, indeed, been so frequently in "the pickling tub," as he terms it, that at last he came to speak of "my yearly accident" ns a matter of course. Eithei he would find his leg amashed under liim before he was aware by the pain that he had broken it; or he would get " a devil of a tumble" from his horse while riding on slippery ground; or a rocket wvould burst at the wrong time tearing him to pieces; or he would be stabbed all over 1.y the French before he had time to cry "JSemniy lRound" (Je me rendsi); or a bullet would 'whistle through his head, going in at the nose and breaking his jaws, a bit of which he offered for sale to a mouk as a piece of St. Paurs wisdom tooth; or, just as his nose is plaistered up, and the fiery young soldier is so eager to join the fray again that his Scotch surgeoni, with a lively appreciation of Sir Charles's nasal organ, is obliged to warn him, "Ye'll lose your nob though, ye'll lose your neb"-swoop on his shoulders comes a great billet of wood from a garret window, grazes his cheek, tears the silk from aiB wouud, and narrowly misses the destruction of his poor battered nose. He wrote home :-" I am wounded, dear mother. You never saw so ugly a thief as I am." "Havilg broken the gristle of my snout, my fate is to he always a snuffler. What a passion the devil must be in at being so often baulk-ed !" He made thus light of his sufferings as usual, but loss of blood and lowness of diet told aeriou4ly on his constitution. " There I my biscuit Ia= run away on maggots' legs I" he exclaims in one of his letters; and not only was the commissariat of the army reduced to such 8traits that Napier was on one occasion for three days without food, and often glad to partake of maggoty biscuits, but he was naturally so abstemious that he never touched wine, and often adopted a purely vegetable diet. This, combined with his wounds and a somewhat liberal application of the lancet-an instrument in such requisition by the surgeons of the period that in these journals we
read of a man depriveed in 24 hours of not less than
100 ounces of blood, and recovering after all-made Charles Napier extremely sensitive to cold, and in some measure prepared him to endure, and even to enjoy, the s corching heat of his Scindiau campaigns.
Amid all the pleasures of the " pickling tub," however, Napier never forgot his claims to promotion,
and actuaUy wrote to the Prince Regent, relating his services; referring to his six wounds obtained in two
yeasC; pointing out that every Corunua major
exept himseli-even thos,e 'who were his junior;, auch as Hugh Gough and Colin Campbell-had been promoted; and roques,ting that he might receive either the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, kearing date from Corunna, or be made the LieuUsnt-Colonel of a regiment. After some little delay, which gave rise to many absurdr suspicions ,with regard to old Pivot's jealousy of Moore's glory,
and the Duke of York's jealousy of Wellington's fame, as if to be recommended by Moore or
Wellington was certain damnation, not to mention ihe fact that Major Napiers " very existence vwa an offence to Royal pride," he obtained
his desire, and became Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Qd Roe'iment. Discontenteted as u Tsual, hoeever, h1is gratitude for the promotion was an eeho of the
atatemenlt that itwas " a damnued same he did nlot
and~ if cu Opinioms of Sir Charwles -Ta-e Z?apier., G.aC.B, y Ljeuten°anb,General Sir W. Napier, K.O.B. ZA four volmeo, Vols. I. and II. London: Muxra. -
get it before ;" and he even regarded it as an insult since the discipline of the regiment required his immediate presence. Yet, on the contrary, thers were murmurs that the Prince had done a job to Eerve him, and that the Duke would have some "trouble to satisfy the army." On arriving iu England (25th of August, 1811) he furthermore, in consideration of his.wounds, obtained from Lord Liverpool the sinecure government of the Virgin Isles. Sabsequently, in addition to his appointment, he obtained a pension for his wounds; but in this case he thought it becoming to resign the governmient. In the June following he was ordered with his regiment to Bermuda, and, although much against his will, he had in this retirement the opportunity of recruiting his healthh, and of profoundly meditating on those experiences of war which he had purchased so dearly in the Peninsula. Here he lived under the benign sway of General Horsford, or King Horsford; as he was called, a Governor well enough described in the saying of an Irishman-" Poor man, he tries to look sensible, and no one can do more." The chief society of the colony was composed of spirit dealers; the colony itself was so small that "the smell of cedar is overpowered by that of rlum ;" and Charles N{apier, before he had been long inthis poetical retreat-being the supposed locality of T7he Temnpest, and the native place of Caliban-fbund the day so heavy on his hands, that for the first time in his life he began to speculate in gastronomy-making the discovery that whalesteak is not unlike veal, only much nicer,and paying marked attention to his cow, as the most interesting female of hi, acquaintance. With all his studies of war-studies which afterwards were of essential service to him-and with all his attention to his regiment, he began to feel disgusted with his profession, and wished to pitch his "sword where it ought to be-with the devil." "I could get on," he says, "with a duck, a chicken, a turkey, a horse, a pig, a cat, a cow, and a wife, in a very contented way." "A few centuries back," he adds, '" I should have been a hermit, making free with the rules of the order, by taking a wife instead of a staff; one cross-grained thing is as good as another." Behold, just as he is writing in this vein of peacefal sentiment-" what a cursed life is a soldier's !" came rumours of an expedition against the UnitedStates, and instantly he exclaims-" By Jove ! I am most amiably disposed to maraud and make money of the Yankees." In a few days he received an order to sail. "1 May, 1813. Sir Sydney Beckwith has just come with a force to whop the Yankees. I go second in command, and am in most excellent tranquil spirits." It is almost unnecessary to say that this American war . was iUconceived and worse executed. The wisdom of those who planned the enterprise may be inferred from one simple fact, that Mr. Croker, in the name of the Admiralty, proposed to send frigates of light draught up the St. Lawrence to act on the Canadian Lakes, utterly regardless of Kiagara. But over and above the original folly of the scheme it appears from the present narrative that the expedition was unfortunately commanded, in its naval arm, by an Admiral who fancied himself the greatest General alive, and in its military arm by a General who fancied himself the greatest Admiral. So conducted, who can wonder at the result? The American power had, in fact, been underrated by the British army flushed with Peninsular victories, and relying on its perfect discipline. The astonishment excited in Charles Napier by the irregular mode of warfare pursued by our Transatlantic kinsmen is somewhat amusing. " They fight unfairly, firing jagged pieces of iron and every sort of deviLnent,-nails, broken pokers, old locks of guns, gunbarrels, everything that will do minchief. A 241b.-shot in the stomach is fine-we die heroicaUy; but a brass candlestick for stuffing, with a garnishing of rusty twopenny nails, makes us die ungenteelly and with the cholic." The worst of this war, however, vras, that it was waged against our own brother. There were numbers of officers, especially in the navy, whose families were American, and some of whom even had fathers living in the very towns it was their business to sack. Charles iNapier, tired of such dubious warfare, proposed to the authorities amore thorough going scheme, involving aservile insurrection. The detailsof his plan are at least inaenious, and if it should ever be our misfortune hereafter to be embroiled with the United Statesthey may be worthy of attention. At al events, it was iNapier's conviction that, had his proposals been accepted, we should have been able to dictate the terms of peace and to abolish slavery in America. His proposals were not accepted for three reasons,-we shrank from invoking the horrors of intestino and revengeful war; we should have been at a loss how to dispose of the millions of liberated blacks; and, most important of all, in the West Indies wehad slaves of ourown, who might be inoculated by tbe bad example. Sir Charles Napier says that these objections were " false and foolish"-a favourite phrase of his; but they were not so then, although they might be so now. At the present day, with the problem of emancipation solved in our own colonies only the first of these objections would have weight -the plea of humanity, and to that argument there I are two sides. For if, on the one hand, in th6
i>.terest of humanity we might wish to forbear from inflicting the terrors of servile war, we might, on the other hand, in the very same interest, be incited to obtain even at this enormous cost the abolition of slavery; and between the two conflicting motives humanity would be forgotten, and reasons of policy or reasons of strategy alone prevail. In this view the suggestions of Sir Charles KNapier are worthy the consideration not only of those who mav regard tho States from a hostile point of view, but also of those who seek their most enduring welfare.
From America Napier returned to England, baving exchaaged into his old regiment, the 50th, at that time tighting in the Pyrenees. But ere he reached his native land the French war had ended; and now, in his 32d year, reduced to halfpay, he entered the military college at Farnham, with his brother William. The record of the next few years is simply the record of a student's life; and Sir W. Napier has filled up this portion of his narrative with extracts from his -brother's note-book, enunciating vigorous criticisms on the mode of conductiDg war, on various campaigus, ancient and modern, on the various branches of the service, and on a great number of points connected with the rmanagement of armies. Be turned his attention also to history and civil policy, and elaborated those theories of the sword and of the sceptre, of warfare and of government, which he was ere long to have an opportunity of testing practically; for towards the close of 1817 he passed his examination, taking the first certificate, and finally, as the reward of his industry, obtained a staff appointment as inspecting field. offlcer in the Ionian Islanlds. This was a step to a still higher appointment, that of military resident at Cephalonia, which he obtained early in 1822, after he had been three years in these islands. Unfortunately, as usual, he found it impossible to agree with his superior officers. At first he was inder the rule of Sir Thomas Maitland, who is described as "a man of rough despotism and coarse manners, narrow-minded and constantly drunk," and against whose control he inveighed with his usual impetuosity, praising, on the other hand, Sir Frederick Adam, through whom he obtained the residency at Cephalonia. On the death of Maitland Sir F. Adam became I;ord High Commissioner. Napier suddenly discovered that ha
had exchanged tho rule of King Log for that of cKing Stork, and pathetically exclaimed, -" I can no longer do the good I did in Maitland's time," Sir Frederick Adam began the work of superintendence by ordering Colonel Napier to shave his moustaches, and ended by brushing him clean out of the island. Who was right and who was wrong in the incessant squabbles of those 10 years which Napier spent in Greece it is difficult to say, although the narrative before us is very highly coloured in favour of our hero. Probablythere were faults on both sides. The Lord High Commissioner, being somewhat of a mratinet, regarded with too little indulgence the primitive justice and vigorous naturalism of Napier, while he, on the other hand, attributed envious motives to his s5-
perior, wrote of him as a fool and an ass, poohpoohed his circumlocution schemes, and, solo-player as he was born to be, performed his part in publc life with the imDatient vanity one might expect from a Pagaiiiui were he compelled to tune his fiddle in an orchestra of mediocrities. At any rate, the never-failing contrast which Sii W. Napier indicates bAweens the viceroy's unwieldy schemes-. " How not to do it," ard the resident's short cuts, "H ow to do it," the failures of the one and the successes of the other, suggests this aaumption of
superiority on the part of Charles da pie- ass umption that in his case was not likely to be tacit. However this be, thehtwo did not work wesll together, and we are convinced that the fault was not entirely
gentleman, now in his glsve withfQobody to defend him from the fury of Sir i*. Napier, who blusters about his folly and malignity, and in his most indignant vein wishes to know whether the vengeance of history be punishment sufficient for a criminal so great.
Spite of all opposition, Napier had a pleasant life of it in these isles of Greece. He was there in all the excitement of the Greek war of independence, and took so much interest in it that he was on the poir,t of retiring from the British army to take the commnnand of the Greek forces. To this he was in a great measure incited by the ardour of Lord Byron, vith whom he became intimately acquainted. "H He is our man to lead a regular force, or to organize a national one for the Greeks," wrote ,lyron. "Ask the army: ask anybody." Full of enthusiasm, Napier entertained the scheme. " There never was such a country for self-defence as Greece," he declared, and he had aU his plans ready in a very short time. Neither the Greeks on the spot, nor the Greek comnmittee in London, however, were so quick ia their decisions; doubts were raised, time was lost, nobody knew what to do, and Napier began to wish himself well out of the affair. The Greek committee in London " draughted a ship with Newman's watercolours, to encourage the artistic talent-of men who were istriving for life," and subsequently, when Napier wasconsulted by Joseph flume about a battering, train to be sen4t oat to Greece, the proposal drew from him the sarcasm, " How prone men are to buy fiddles before they know music !" Ere long it -was supposed tha' he had compromised his position as a British officer in conspiring with the Greeks; he had to clear himself from the charge; disgusted with delays and mis-management, he withdrew from all active interference; Lord Byron was no more, and finally came tidings of the siege of Missolonghi, the fearful sufferings of men, women, and children living for 17 days on the carcases of horses, cats, and rats, and the horrible storming that after. such miseries was to be regarded rather as a blessing than a disaster.
All this time Colonel Napier had a still higher enjoyment in the government of his island and in promoting the welfare of its 60,000 inhabitants"the greatest liars in the world." He forgot Adam in thinking of Macadam; he constructed more than 100 miles of road- -40 blasted out of solid rock. "There are such beautiful milestones," he wrote to his mother, "that the mules stop to admire them and donkeys gaze with wonderment." His heart was in these roads, and with sentimental humour he declared his wish " to be buried on the summit of Liberales, in the old chapel-not caring for church or chapel, but to lie on the top of the road. Many a poor mule's soul will say a good word for me at the last day, when tbey remember the old road." Not only did he seek in this way to dissipate the enmities of the valleys, to repress robbery, and to bring the people into closer contact with each other,-he also built market-places, constructed quays and lighthouses, w idenedand pavedthestreets, drainedmarshes,established fisheries, tried a model farm, erected a model prison,appointedschools, restoredbarracks, organized a police, introduced spinning-wheels into the island, and dealt right vigorously with the abuses of the courts of justice. -He had enough to do, and the wonder is how he accomplished it all with the small means at his disposal, and all the time maintaining a treasury so full that Adam was able to draw upon it to a considerable extent for the exigencies of Corfu. The secret of his success, also the secret of Sir Frederick Adam's check upon him, was that Sir Charles Napier was a little despotic. At one time he had enormnous power in his hands " I can send any one to death without trial or appeal. This is a fearful power-but I like it. If comispelled to hang any one it shall be done on the perfect conviotion that it is right." This is quite in accordance with an opinion which he expressed many years afterwards, " that a good tough, despotic Government, sufficiently bloody, is the best of all possible forms of ruling." He had two principles in dealina with the Greeks-" caution in finding out what ought to be done, and then bullying all who resist. They like it." "i The only things that bore me are the church and convent affairs, excepting, however, a beautiful nun of 10, who dislikes being one very much, and I have blowed up her old devil of an aunt, the abbess, for making her one." The question, however, remains-did the Cephaloniotes really like it? By his system of forced labour Colonel Napier constructed great public works at one-tenth of the cost to which we areaccustomed in England ; he even made more than 100 miles of mountain road in Cephalonia at less expense than Sir F. Adam made a few miles of level road in Corfu. The results were highly creditable to his ingenuity. They were probably also very useful to the community over which he presided; but it is hard to believe that they were effected without oppression. Sir Charles Napier declared that his 60,000 subjects-"tbe greatest liars in the world" -were delighted; Sir Frederick Adam declared that they were not delighted; and the upshot of the matter was that in 1830, in his 49th year, and after 11 years' residence in these Ionian Islands, the Colonel retired to vegetate in England for 10 long years.
He had now an opportunity of realizing the vision which had filled his imagination six winters before. "Forty-one years have I played hardy, but for the next 41 feather-beds, turtle-soup, green fat, diseased liver of tormented goose, and porter shaU be welcome." In some respects a very pretty vision, although slightly different from that which fired his soul when, in the Bermudas, he aspired only to " a duck, a chicken, a turkey, a horse, a pig, a cat, a cow, and a wife." This last luxury, it will be especially observed, in comparing the two visions of happiness, has, in the interval, dropt out of Napier's imagination, unless we are to suppose it included under the general idea of " turtle." In his young days he was always dreaming of marriage, and on one occasion declared that he "never saw an old bachelor worth a farthing." So long as his. mother lived, however, he had al the womanly sympathy and affection that he required, and it was not until he had to moun her loss that-then in his .u,f year, and in all the bitterness of griuf-he sought for consolation in marrying a lady of Whom Sir William Napier curtly says that she was " a widow much older than himself but to whom he was strongly attached." With this lady and two daughtershe returned in his 49th year to enjoy h:
"turtle-soup" in England. Whether he tze;. "porter" in combination with it is :ot revealed, but we know that he dipped into a more likrl,3 m -- ture-uspuebaugh 185 years old. In the 'idst of this inactive, easy life came a th.- ,rlsxt. He doted on his wife with all the araour of a heart that was c"-able of the most intense passion. Sh.e died, le-ivinog him wild with grief and medi'atin-. suicide in oraer to join his "adored El: " U't5*7 la ly head, my head seems to burt" he v.. . "Oh mercy ! mercy! for this seems past enuarance." His suffering was very great while it lasted, but he very soon consoled himself with another wife, whom Sir William describes more complacently as "the widow of Captain Alcock, R.N.," and, what is more than all, a connexion of the family by a circuitous route which
none but a Napier would think of tracing, she being niece to the husband of one of Charles Napier's female cousins german. A strong nature like his, however, could not long lie fallow,could not always rest satisfied with purely domestic joys. He dabbled in politics-" Oh the Whigs, oh that Stanley, oh that Lord Grey!" In this way he had a passage of arms with O'Connel, and (he had attained the rank of MajorGeneral) obtained the nickname of "iDoldramleneral" from the man who had called Wellington a " stunted corporal" and Hardinge a "one-armed miscreant." He also dabbled in merchandise, and lost money in the Philadelphian funds. Hedabbled in litigation with the Duke of Richmond, and gained very little by it. He dabbled in colonization, expecting to be made Governor ot Australi, but not succeeding. He dabbled in literature, by which he gained 5l0., and by which the country has lost an historical romance that,whenrecovered, will befound, it is said, to have many striking resemblances to Bulwer's romanc of the same name-Earold. What has become of it nobody knows. The last we hear of it is that it is in Colburn's hands, and that N.pier cannot get an answer from inm.
At last came more active if not very congenial employment. Early in 1839 he was appointed Commander of the Northern District in England; a district which comprises 11 counties. At this timethe mase of the people were greatly excited, and the Government was greatly alarmed. " Funk is the order of the day" wrote Napier; at least it vas so
with everybody but Lord Fitzroy Somerset, who is characteristically describedasfollows :-" Of allthose who seein to-treat the people's feeligs lightest he
is the mam He seems to think it only a passing discontent, and he is so clever a fell6w, and so od a fellow,;that,.to own the trath, he almost staggered me."' If everybody had, been enrdoweed with Lord Fitzroy's apathy the discontent Would have continued to this day. It never did pass away until4 by the abolition of the Corn Laws, breaa became plentiful and trade becamo flourishing. In those days the best handloom weaver could earn no imore than 5s. a-week, and when the inferior operatives were driven to ask for alms their only relief was to be found in workhouses that -were hateful as the Bastile. So in these times of Protection and the new Poor Law, the starving labourers abhorred the employers for their paltry wages, and abhorred them still more for the
' cold porridge" of their charit;y. Yet there was no
insurrection. A few pikes were distributed, in- i deedc a few men were drilled; there were many meetmngs and much rather excited speaking; the
Charter was demanded; and there was talk of I assassination and conflagration, revolution and retribution. To restrain these elements, not so much of danger as of apprehension, we had no perfectly drganized police; and inl sO far as the force was organized at all, the " Peelers" were in ranch less favoulr th3an the soldiery with the multitude. The army, therefore, was the main resource for the prevention of riot and mischief, and to Sir Charles Napier was intrusted the most important command in England, his head-quarters being at
ottingha2, where he seemrs to have enjoyed himself, and at DManchester, which he describes as "the chimney of the world, the entrance to Hell realized." To judge fromhis talk, Sir Charles was well acquainted with the nether world, and we are indebted to him for the information that " Hel may be paved with good intentionsj but is assuredly hung with Manchester cottons;" Notwithstanding alarrms, rumours, and marchings to and fro, the troops being divided into no less thau 26 detachments, which the magistrates . of the different districts were continuaUy proposing to subdivide still further, tiU at last
there seemed a prospect of the whole force being' reduced to a series of umits-one soldier to every village,-nothing serious occurred, and the whole history of Napier's command may besummed up in one short extract from his journal *-
"1839, July 30.-Alarm I trnmpets i magistrates in a fuss. Troops! troops! troops! North, south, east, west. I screech at these applications like . gate swinglng-on rusty himges and swear! Lord, how they make me swear! The people are not ready for a fight though; there may be bloodsheand burmnios, but no fighting."
Spite of swearing, to which he was incorrigibly addicted, Napier, who was half a Chartist in his way, did his duty well, prevented any collision of his troops with the people, and at the same time managed to preserve order. In the journals and letters of the period there are many curious details and instructive incidents which render this part of his memoir the most interesting to the student of domestic politics. It will there be seen how the strings are uDled; how, between the Home-office, the Horse uards, and the local magistrates and magnates the General in command runs consider-
able danger of being pulled to pieces; by what I arrangement of his troops Napier thought that he could most overawe the people; what kind of shot, if it were necessary to fire on the mob, creates least damage and most dismay; the respective uses of cavalry and infantry against masses of the populace; and,
finally, how in the midst of all his anxieties and! labours Sir Charles rejoiced his soul by a " splendid. feed" at Alrs. WVard's in Nottingham. Interesting,
however, as this portion of the biography is to the, English politician, on the other hand, as character-i istic of Napier in this uncongenial employment of head policeman, we are not furnished with many illustrative traits. In the midst of his constabulary I duties the old soldier's heart leaps as he hearsl of his cousin " Black Charles's" doings at Acre, and he seems even to have a grim satisfaction in the excitement of recording shortly afterwards, "Black Charles at loggerheads with Stopford." He, too, had his little squabble with AMacaulay for travelling expenses,, the refusal of which he never forgave. But the most remarkable trait was evinced in a little bib of advice which he gave to the Government of the day as to the policy which they ought to pursue. Poor Sir Charles was dumbfouhded when a request came from Lord Hill that for the future he should keep his advice to himself.
,There is not much excitement or glory in a sentrybox, and Napier was glad to exchange his watchmaan's duty in the North of England for an Indian appointment. Like the old war-horse, " he smelt the battle afar off." He was indeed old for the
work before hinm, and when the gallant veterau I buckles on his father's sword, sets out for India,
and, arriving there, begins to feel the oppression of J the climate, it is not without sympathythat we; read in his journal such an explanation as the fol-| lowing:-" Oh for 40, as at Cephalonia, where I laughed at 18 hours' hard work on foot under a
burning sun; now at 60, how far will my carcass? carry me ?"
Of Napier's Indian career it is not our intention to speak with any fulness of detail at present, as there will be a more fitting opportunity of doing so when the next two volumes of the biography make their appearance. The two already published are chiefly devoted to the first 60 years of his life, and just as the reader becomes interested in his Indian adventures the narrative suddenly stops. In this stage of our information, therefore, it wlll be sufficient to indicate the general bearings of Sir Charles Napier's position with regard to India when, in the winter of 184142, he joined the Bombay division of the army. There was work to be done, requiring more than ordinary vigour, for never since our first occupation of the country did our prospects in the
East look more gloomy. Elphinstone's force had | been destroyed in the retreat from Cabul; Sale was besieged in Jellalabad; Macnaghten, the prime mover of this Affghan war, was assassinated; Nott was menaced at Candahar, and Scinde
was growing troublesome. At this juncture,I a few weeks after Sir Charles Napier landed in' India, Lord Ellenborough arrived, and almost his first act was to write to Napier for his opinion and his advice. He gave advice which Sir William tells us was substantially followed throughout the subse-
quer.t canpaign, and in consequence of which the, British fmr'a were extricated from their difficultie3; Pollock v-' ; set to relieve Sir Robert Sale; Salo brilliai.tlr fou- ilt his way out of Jellalabad; and
Napier himseli was sent to Scinde to control'
l aeers. in all his subsequent operaas b- had it very much his own way, and, . t, he set out for Scinde with the inTniltion of being his own master. "My design and hope are to find excuses for acting on my own responsibility, and going right before there is time to set mo wrong." His own view of the duty which he had toperform was characteristically expressed in the following terms :-" We have no right to seize Scinde, yetwe shall do 8o, and a very advantageous, useful, hnmane piece of rascality it will be." He arrived in Scinde with full powers, political and military, to coerce the Ameers into submission to the
terms of the treaty, which had been negotiated by' Lord Auckland, and which they took every means of evading. On his arrival forth came the Ameers to meet him. Every Ameer sent him 20 large trays of
sweetmeats, so that he had more than 100 -trays.
Having thus prepared the way, they received him' in state; they salaamed and talked him over ; they asked if he was happy and comfortable; they asked if he was very happy and very comfortable; they aTh tried on his spectacles, and, having satisfied their curiosity with regard to his oroaans of vision, they proceeded to see whether he had an eye to businesg-the principal Ameer offering him a little present of 6,0001.,which, to their great disgust, the Feringhee General Saib declined. The Ameers, in fact, wanted to evade the treaty, to levy tolls to wlhich they were not entitled, arid in the hope of recovering absolute possession of Scinde made various excuses for the presence of armed bodies of their followers in the neighbourhood of tlie"British cantonments. To no purpose. Napier was not to be foiled. With swift decision, immense energy, and unbounded courage, he laughed at their diplomacy, tore their letters, surprised them in their fastneses, routed them in the field; in short, completelysubdued theAmeers, and in the Queen's name took possession of Scinde. How in carrying out his design he had a memorable quarrel with Major Oaitram, which spread far and wide, and wras maintained on both sides with unmitigated asperity how, after getting rid of the political agent, he fought battles under a scorching ui,madeforced marches through a desert deemed impenetrable by Earopeansi and, accordingtothoDuke'sopinion,trn. poltedhisguns "inamannerthemostextraordinay;
how also from his position of .commaud'zb& k nished a series of reports and State papers, of which t-A late.SirRobert Peel said, "I have no heuifa-' cninplacin.*gthem in comparison witIrthe-' Gftr:-
wood Despatches,' and with.tbe best things of,tte kind which bave ever been wrtten".-are matters &f notoriety. Napier had his faults, and they were faults that made many enernies; yet through all his- egotism and all his tyranny there shine forth the loyal heart, the brilliant contrivance, and the indomitable energy ot a truly great man. aT is not possible to accept the statement of his brother that his noblest actions were most factiously assailed, that his virtues were ntudiously depreciated, that his talents were underrated and unemployed, tbat his zervices were scurvily requit-d, and that history must reverse the judgaent of siccessive Sovereigns and Governments; for to the morbid vanity of Napier 'reward is stinted, hobour is nought, and praise is blame ' so long as a single reward is withheld, the highest honours have not been attained, and the proudest laUds bave not been sung. It is at the same time a pleasure to be able to add that the fact which afTfords Sir iMlliam Napier ample consolation for the fancied wrongs of his brother is no snore than the simple truth:;-" his fame has been accepted by the British people as belonging to the glory of the nation."

Sir,-In reading your able revie of the life of Sir Charles Napier, in The Mrdwn of this morning, it appears to me that you must have been unawre of a circumstance, which, though not alluded to, Isuppose, by her son, mast yet have gone far, one would thinkr to dilute the RoYal jra against the descendants of the Lady Sah Xapie Their father was not the first or sole possessor of her fair hind previous to her marriage with him- She had been for 14 years the wife of Sir Thomas Charles Btnbury, and it was only after her divorce from Sir Thomas that she became the wife of the Hon. George N;apier and the mother of Sir Charles and of hisrhistorian. Surely the phials of Royal wrnth and Royal jealousy should have been poured upon the head of the finst favoured Sir Thomas, and not upon that of his saccew6r Napier, whom Majesty could at best have enu vied but at second hand.

Wine-Growing In Australia.-The homoeo-
WINE-GRow1G ix Ausm.AuA.-The homceopatbic principle "Srimilia similibus curantuF" receives a fresh illustration from the fact, which now seems tolerably authehticated, that to get a nation to drink plenty of wine is the surest way to cure that nation of drunkenness. Wine indeed, besides, beides makingglad the heatt of man, someti2nes gives him the gout in tho extremities, while it must
be confessed that wine over night and sodawater in the morningoccslnnally stand towards one another in the relatioh ofcause and effect. But thoughindividuals do, nations nevergetdrunk upon wine. Wordswoith, the poet, described Tam o' Shanteras a "d rate and Scottish drankard," making, as a critic rem= ted the word Scottish a climax to the word desperate in matters dranken. Novv Scotland, besides being the hardest-drinking, is one of the best educated countries in Christendom. Scotchmen moreover are constitutionally prudent, yet Scotland is aliviys drunk because it has no wine-because you cannot gather grapes from thistles. Ireland probably-if its means were commensurate with its inclinathon-woind drink as hard as Scotland. As it is, the people of the Emerald Isle are over. fond oftheir native "dew" 'ecause they have no wine. In EDn and John Bull enlarges his body andcontracts his mind
ith filoods of " heavy- wet," because grapes cannot be persuaded to naturalize themselves among the fogs so 'as to grow larger than currants or sweeter than vinegar. America is at once a hard and a various drinker.' The inventive energies of a now world have found a wide scope among slings, and juleps, and cocktails, and nogs, and the thousand-and-one artful componnds upon which ColumbiA continuously inebriates herself. But when the stars neon his spangled banner begin to twinkle and multiply before the eyes of the young republican, give him plenty of wine and their number and outline become clear to him again directly. So at least affirms a Cincinnati authority that we quoted yesterday, and according to which it appears that vine and temperance are there cominginto fashion together. To enlarge upon the sobriety of the Fronch and German residents ia wine-producing countries would be trite, bet altogether it appears well established that wine is the best cure for drankenness, and that vinesard associations beat teetotal societies hollow in promoting national temperance. Apart, then, from the question of development of resources, the encouragement of a new branch of industry, and the creation of a fresh export, the well-wishers to Australia will join us in the desire we have so often expressed to see the cultivation of the vino extended here. The present time appears a favourable one for re-urging this subject npn public attenfron. The testimony of the connoisseurs
wO were appointed judges of the wine sent to the Paris ExMbition has convinced thousands of persons who were quite incredulous as to the evidence of their own
taste, that much of the produce of Australian vineyards is quite equal to that of the finest vineyards of Europe. The consequence has been that in New South Wales a demand for homegrown wine has sprang up which has surprised the growers almost as much as those who have hitherto regded vine-culture as a kind of agricultural quixotism.
ood vineyards have become valuable properties-the reputation of making good wine has become a remunerative risession, and the difficulty no longer is to find castomers orM. wne, but wine for the customers. For many years to come we believe that this state of th i us must continue, and that those who turn their attention to winegrowing vwll meet with a corresponding reward. The quantity that Australia at present produces is ridiculously small comapared with the capacity of Australian consump. tion, putting out of consideration the certainty of a largo export trade to bo established hereafter. 2lhe (London) Tiews, speakng of Australan wines some time ago, said that, though we produced excellent samples, we seemed to confine ourselves to making samples, and never ventured upon making wine in bull;. To a great extent this seems to be still the case. It is true that in New South Wales there are some vineyards yielding 15.000 or 20,000 gallons a-year each, several yielding 10,000. and a very considerable number supplying from 500 to 5,000; yet it appears that the demand has exhausted the accumnlation of previous years, and even presses upon the comiini vintage. In fact, the habitual use of Australian wine is only checked by the fact that Australia wiU have drank up all the wine she has made before she wril have got fairly into the habit of drinking it at al. The demand, moreover, presses upon the supply to such an extent that Austratian wine is still much too expensive to be of any considerable national benefit. We hope to see the time when pence Will go almost as far as shillings do now in the purchase of Australian wine, and when growers on a large scale, prodiucing their 400 or 500 gallons to the are, wiU still find tho cultivation highly profitable. In the meantime, however, those who are most active and prompt in planting vines wil, of course, reap the richest harvest. It is a mist6-eto suppose that wine-making presents any extreme difficulties, or that only a few kinds of soil and situation are suitable to the culture of the viae. Some partionlar soils and situations may, indeed, be so favourable as to give a fan'tastic celebrity and value to the wine therein produced, but we believe that in the most varions soils and over the greater part of these colonies the vine would so thrive as to yield a wholesome and merchantablo wine that would be profitable to the grower and beneficial to the country. In almost all directions the owners of land would do well to take advantage of the growing taste for native wines; to begin making vineyards, and to increase them year by year, as can be done, ii done graduaUy, at an expenditure of labour and money small in comparison with the certain return.-Jfeibourne Argus.
C0LLISiON BETW-EE.N AUSThALLy IHOUSES OF AsEMBLY.-& considerable number of members of the Upper House have resolved upon doing one conspicuous thing, but whether for the sake of "maintainingBritish analogies," as the phrase goes, or for what other reason, we know not, it unfortunately happens that the thing proposed to be done is-mischief. It is said that the Council
poses to throw out the Bill for abDlishing promerty qualcation for the members of the Assembly. We trust that "the best informed circles " may prove in the wrong upon this point, for we believe that the Counacil would, by such a step, aot only injure the colony, but would give a serious blow to its own reputation and to its chances of future usefulness. Of tho abstract impropriety of a property qualifi. cation, and of its peculiar inapplicability to the cxiromstances of a now colony, we have frequently expressed our decided conviction. To bO rich here is evidenco of nothin but that a man has made money; and if it bo right at ai to imposo any restriction upon tho free choice of electors, it is diufflt to conceive a worse and more inapplicable test than that of wealth. It is needless to reargue this matter, however, for we believe it to be one as to which the mind of the community is thoroughly and finally made up. The question is not as to the evils of a property qualification, but as to the probabilitv of its being preserved by the Upper House. Should the tipper House resolve to do this, we believe it Will have anu almost fatal effect u pon the experiment of the double Chamber. The Upper House will be placed at once in a position of direct and violent anta-onism to the country at arge; its first important act wili bo to thwart the deliberate desire and opinion of the great mass of the people of aU classes. At present, in spite of the titles with which memubers of Council have been adorned, their'credit with the country is something yet to be established. The expressed fear of manv is that the Council will prove more than a check upon hasty legislation ; that it will prove an impediment and astumblingblock in the way of useful legislation. The Council should be studiously careful, and especially at the outset of its career, to do nothing to justify thia irnpression. As a check upon hasty legislation the Council may no doub, properly refuse to sanction a measare apparentJy supported only by a pa-sing gust of popularity; but we do not think that itcanrightly oppose aineasure infavour of which the will of the conntry is unquestionably and permanently fixed. Bat if there be any kind of question as to which more than another the Council ought not to assume such an antagonistic attitude, it is a question relating exclusively to the constitution of the other House of Parliament. Mr. Duffy's B01 does not go the length of abolishing pro. perty qualification altogether - it only abolishes that test for members of the Assembly. he Assembly has agreed to a Bill for reforming itself, and nothing could be moreimpolisic and indefeniible in the Council than that it should stand in the way of such reforination. It was by precisely similar opposition that the House of Lords endangered the peace andsafety of England at the time of the Reform Bill aitation, Sad it was only by the threat of an inundation of newr peers that they were brought to submission, if set to reason, x Our conatitutiozi afords us no such remedy in extreme Case
andahllthp more potent and dangerona willl be the pent up 'exasperation of the people if they find a Chatuber of th

New Code Of Signals.
I. N2EW CODE O ~aG4L$, ; ,;
Tho Boarc" of Tr14e 0oU&onl havb.* prme - Amore useful and ameptable eernoe'to the wer.utilo marine of .thiscountry, and , iodeed, of aU natior* thsnwzen it under. took an investigation of tlxe meine of improiig The iniAde
£f signalizing between s?ip6 at sea.-
The defects had long been p4tent And,pxlpable, forsILthe signal codes in use. appear to havebee ;denigneda4diierpetuated upon the vicious principle of numeralsjwhich,,oofined to ten digits only, made it necessary to provide either duplicate flags or suhstituteA, lo zepresent those alradr used in a signal, and also confined the range of which four flaga are capable, even withlthe aid of these substitutes, to V,999separato signals,-& number totallyiusuffieent to effets; what is necessary.
Hencemeans were obliged to, 1 adopted to repet
number of 9,999 in several divisions by the exhibition otf eless or index flags, to denoto the divisions referred to, hoisted over or under the signal, or at some other masthead; the consequence of which was that what with the ca;r
necessary for placing the sobstitutes in their proper positions, of distingaishing the index flag, and the rule, and complications involved, signalizing iwas but seldom resorted to, and many desirable opportUeitins of 0olmunicating a sea dechned on account of the difficulty of adjusting ind de4 ciphering these combinations. deI
It is remarkable that tbe lateCaptainMarryatt, a high!T inteligent officer, who published a dode of sgnals about 3q years ago, should have adhered to the numeral system, sot only on account of those complications of .which he ustn have been aware, bat because the late Sir Home Pophatn had at the close of the war (in 1816) amended this defect sin his Tdegraiphic Vocabulary, used in the Royal navy, by tho introduction of flags distingujahed by alphabetical letters, so sato enable him, by the increased nutnber of permutations made available by a larger numbier pf digits than the te" numerals affordtd, to increase teope of hbs vocabulay.
The advantage of this course is palpable; for we find tha,t whereas in the numeral plan 1T orI8 symbols are requre4 to express the 10 digits, with the neoessry adjuncts of tele: graph, numeral, geographical, anad other sectiona1 fiag4 contingent on that system, and involving ailisplay ofJfivm o maore symbols to expross one aignil by, giving to IS fia
irdependent significations, such as letters of the alphabet, their permutations will produce no les than 78,64-2 separate mignal; and that atblout a necessity for ihib'liting more than four in any one signal.
The substitution of letters for numeral figures, in deig nating the 18 flags usedin the code authorized by the Boardi of Trade, is not the only improvement. Being divided intS two parts, the nessages in thoefirstintinated by three, and thosein the second by four flags, A means of international communication is made available.
The first part is csnposed of the messages words, geographical names, latitude, longitude, compas signals, &c., which form the substanoe of all. signal books, exprssead without referonce to alphabetical arrangement. These ara classed intosubjects, and every signal is intimated by the same letters placed against it. In all laugtages the signal will have the same meaning, and it can be made known either by the same or corresponding fisga adopted by preo. vious arrangement.
The second part comprses a more extensive vocabulary, and the words being placed in alphabetical succession it is ' applicable to national use only, or to nations such as Eng. !and'and America, using the same language. This forms
klso an index to the first part, for ial the signals thereinate' enumerated in the second part, with the two or thrde letterg which denote them, and cau therefore be readily referred to.
There arc-other advantages, such as the intimation of the nature of a signal by tbo shape of the uppermost flag; but the mpst important feature is the means which the vast scope of this code affords of giving to every individual vessel a distinctive signal, by the exhibition of which its identiy can be made known and concisely conveyed by letter or by electric telegraph, in order to be correctly reported in tho shipping lists. The preparation and maintenance of a list of 40,000 or 50,O00 Merchant vessels renders pecessary a separate book, which contains this and other miatter interesting to nautical persons, and is published sunually under the title of The Mercantilc Navy List. There are also monthly supplements to proclaim the names
of vessels supplied with distinctive signals in the interval' between the yearly publication of the book, in which they become eventually incorporated, An alphabetical index
available for reference to a ny particular vessel, the distinctive signal of which it is wished to ascertain, adds] greatlr to the utility of the scheme.
These books with the supplements will be placed in ships of war, Coast Guard stations, and aU Government depart-
ments. They will also be supplied by shipping masters in.- every port to captains of vessels vhen midng arrangements foravoyage; andownersof ships should providethe four particular flags which signify a vessel's name, and make it imperative that they shall be hoisted whenever opportunity offer.,
Indian Telegraph viâ The Red Sea.
IZNDIAN TELEGRAPE vO THE RED SEA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-On the 15th of March Mr. Pinneger wrote, as solicior to the Earopean and Indian Janotion Telegraph Company, complaining that I have acted in bad faith towards his clients in prosecuting tho Red Sea line, and he founds his accusation upon three reasons:-
1. That I wrote to Mr. Andrew, chairman of that company, pledging myself not to oppose him.
2. That in an agreement made with that object a clause was specially put in rendering such a pledge obligatory.
3. That a large snm of money was paid me for abandonimg my project of an Indian telegraph vih the Red Sea.
Not one of these reasons is based upon fact.
The letter quoted as written to Mr. Andrew was writtem to one of my co-concessionaires, and no agreement or nnderstanding was ever come to with Mr. Andrew, or with any one else, upon the subject of it.
The paragraph as partially quoted out of the agreement to cede the concession I held for a telegraph between the DardaneUes and Alexandria completely alters the intention and meaning. This agreement was, made with an Austrian. company, to whom Mr. Piimeger is also adviser, and with -whom it is nnderstood the English Government have made arrangements for a complete system of telegrphic commuzication at the eastern end of the Mediteranean. Neither Mr. Andrew's name nor that of any company advocating a telegraph to India occurs or is alluded to in this agreement.
The money to be paid for ceding this concession is to reimburse the concessionaires (of whom there are 10) for the expense and trouble they have been at during three years, and the amount is iden'ical with that which they would. have received nuder the arrangement with the Eastern Telegraph Company, the direction of which was composed of some of the best known names among merchants of the highest standing. This company did not carry out their project, chiefly because the Treasury objected to a sbort isolated line in the Mediterranen being in different bands from lines which will place Constantinople, the Ionian Islands, Alexandria, Malta, Austria, and Frauce under one systemn of management.
The object of the Bastern Telegraph Company was, a3 stated in their prospectus, to complete a line to Alexandri% as the firt stop towards India. When, however, the proinoters of the route vi4 the Red Sea found that this short length to Alexandria hampered them with the Government, tbey determined to hand it over to those whose interests lay in the Mediterranean telegraphs.
The publio are interested in knowing which of the routes to India offers the greatest advantages as a commercial undertaking, because the advocates of both depend upon the commercial character of the undertahing as the basis of its realization. A discussion with that object is legitimate aud uteful; but narrowing the issue to a personal altercation betweex the promoters is unjust to the public, because it blinks the real point, and is unfair to the promoters, who should at leist obtain the credit of having originated projects which are of the highe6t importnce, and of advooaig them upon their merits.
Absenoe on tho continent hm beea the principal causo oe the delay in this commanication.
Your obedient servant.

People who moralize on historyhaveneverdoubted that national greatness has its rise, its eulmination, and its setting. Assyria, Greece, Carthage, Rome, and the rest, have passed away; Spain's boast of an empire on which the sun never set has been transferred to England, the ruins of whose metropolis a popular writer has already figured a New Zealander as contemplating. Why, indeed, should not the great nations of the present time yield the supremacy to younger rivals? England and France are old in comparison with the other great Powers of the world. Even Austria is no longer the German Empire, and as for Ruissia, Prussia, and the United States, they are but upstarts of yesterday. We cannot wonder that all the historians and philosophers, all the theorizers about the progress of civilization and the march of empire, should abound in predictions of the decline whicn is to be the inevitable fate of the leading nations of Europe. There was some years ago a good deal of this tremulous foreboding in England,-the country had seen its day, had reached the apogee of prosperity, and so on. But, happily, the spirit of our people has rejected aU such discouraging suspicions. They feel that a nation which is every day increasing in numbers, in wealth, and also, we may say without presumption, in morality and happiness, which is adding colony to colony and conquest to conquest, cannot be in danger of decline, and that to look forward to an hour of collapse or an epoch of degradation is as absurd as was the conduct of the Laputian philosophers, who made themselves miserable about the inevitable approach of the earth to the sun after a long period of revolutions. But if we feel ourselves young and vigorous, if we are just establishing our Colonial system and taldng possession of our Asiatic Empire, if we are building new Eouses of Parliament and instituting national collections in the fine arts, it is not the same with our nearest neighbour. France is very powerful, much richer than she was; she has a capital which is the resort of the world, and a Court which yields in magnificence to none. But of late years, and especially since the establishment of the Empire, there has been a strange dejection among the educated classes, and all those who think or profess to think on political subjects. Railways, gold coinage, in, crease of trade, and increase of revenue, have failed to restore cheerfulness to a large class of Frenchmen. Amid the feast of prosperity they have always seemed to see a sword suspended over the country. While all Europe has been sounding the praiea of France, France itself has been unsatisfied. The De Profundis of the old political world and the old literary world has mingled with the official Te Daum of the Imperial retainers. All this was to be expected. In France the liberty which was battled for during 60 years is extinct,-cer. tainly for a long time, perhaps for ever. Can we wonder, then, that the eminent men who gained fame and position amid the contests of free political life should, in their old age, look 1with anger on the destruction of all they had founded, and anticipate only decay for the country which has betrayed itself and them ?
The prevalent feeling which has resulted from these auguries of ill has been deepened by the publication of the last Censu. The increase of pdpulation during the five years ending 1856 was only256,000souls,whiletheCensus of 1846 gave an increase of 1,170,000. Now, as the Frenchman is not an emigrant, rarely quitting his country to cultivate the wildernesses of the New World or the Antipodes, this almost imperceptible increase of population is certainly a discouraging sign. Not more than 10,000 French emigrate yearly; it follows, therefore, that the stationary character which population seems now to have assumed must result from some deficiency in prolific power, the consequence of deterioration of race or material obstacles which society should remove. There does, indeed, seem to have been lately a rapid diminution in the rate of increase, until in the present day the increase has almost vanished. But for more than half a century the French have not been a prolific people. In 1790 the population numbered 26,500,000; that is, it was almost equal to the population of the British Islands at the present day. At that time Great Britain hardly contained more than 10,000,000 souls, while Ireland, with some 4,000,000 more, was rather a burden than a support. We may well conceive the advantages which our rival had in those days from her superior numbers, and admire the courage with which our forefathers were always ready for a war with France, a country which had an effective population of not far from three times their own. But now things have indeed altered. The British people have increased and multiplied and replenished the earth in a manner beyond example. Frenchmen may laugh at our large families, while their own households are limited to two or three; but we have certainly the beat of it, since within the last two generations we have been able not only to aJsist in populating America and colonizing Australia but we hxve actually taised our home population Jo something approaching equality with the Frencb, -If we take Great Britain alone,- we find that
,he, population has considerably more than doubled since the Firnch Revolution, while that of Franace has careely increased more than 35 pes cent.
otwitbstxnding Irish famines and English
striles, cholera and short harvests, the number of children born has been continually in enormous excess over the deaths. But in France we find that every natural or political calamity checks the increase in a marked manner. In 1847 the excess of births over deaths fell from 237,000 to 62,000 on account of the scarcity, and this small exces was again diminished to 13,000 by the cholera of 1849. Things grew worse after 1851 under the double influence of scarcity and war, till in 1854 and 1855 the deaths for the first time exceeded the births. Thus we leaxn the stonishing fact that at the present timo the population of France is actually diminishing, although emigration has almost entirely ceased. War, a succession of bad harvests, the grape, blight, and the disease of the silkworm, are all pointed to as having a ahare in producing this sartling result; but we cannot but feel that there must be some cause deeper and more abiding than any of these. For the last 30 years, at least, the proportionate increase has been steadily lesening, and the present time only witnesses the change from increase to diminution. This is a fact which may somewyhat justify a GU]ZOT or a DO TocQuz*vmaz in,their mournful tone.
France has certainly changed in character since her Itevolution. Before that great convulsion the. French had a good deal of what we consider now exclusively Anglo-Saxon qualities. They colonized and conquered; they settled Canada, where they keep their ground to the present day; they planted Louisiana, ascended the Mississippi, and nearly succeeded in checking the development of the Colonies which are now the United States. They got tho start of us in India, won battles, formed alliances, and almost effected what ERov]nEwcz eventually reserved for England. Their fleets, even as late as the American War, were equal to ours in strength, and fought against us without disgrace. Their merchant marine was to a still later period almost equal to ours in tonnage. But within tho present century the two nations have gone different ways. How much we have changed it is unneceusary to say, but certainly France seems to have lost much of the energy and vitality of the old times. The excessive development of the military system in Europe, and the attention paid to strictly Continental concerns, have turned the French from the field on which they wrestled with us under the elder BoUBsoNs. They do not trade and colonize as they used. Manufactures, mostly of an artistic kind, and agriculture, carried on in a comparatively primitive fashion, are the occupation of the people, and these do not give the energy and spirit which more adventurous employments infuse into a population. If we add to this the land system which the Revolution has established, and the parcelling out of inheritances which are too smaU properly to remunerate labour, we may partly explain how it is the Frencb, with all their taste and genius, are smitten with inertness and sterility. Yet we cannot believe in the decay of our brilliant and high-spirited neighbours. France has gone through trials which might have destroyed a nation of less vitality. Revolutions, proscriptions, wars i which the youth of the country perished literally by the million, political insecurity, Communistic agitation, have all tended to misdirect her aims and cramp her energies. When we consider all, the wonder is that the French should have achieved so much. It should be remembered that our own population only beg,an to increase after our political troubles were over. We may, then, hope that with continued tran-
quillity in France the future numberings of the. people will exhibit eults more cheerful and reauring.
The enforced retirement of Mr. BRIGHT from
The enforced retirement of Mr. BIionT from public life, upon which he addresses his late constituents in the letter we publish to-day, is an event in our modern Parliamentary history which we cannot pas over without notice. Let men agree or disagree with his political opinions as they will, upon one point there can be no doubt whatsoever, that a well-graced actor has left the scene. There was a vigour and fire in the man which we seek in vain elsewhere among the candidates for the orator's chaplet in the House of Commons. We remember well when the Reform Bill was passed it was anticipated that a number of rough untameable speakers would be sent up by the new-born constituencies to the House of Commons-men who would deal with the old Parliamentary rhetoric and the good old quotations from the classical authors, and all the received elegancies of the place, in no very reverential spirit, and who would yet earn 'or themselves a great name, and for their constituents greater influence and greater power in the political system. The late Sir RoBEaT PEEL is reported to have said when Mr. BPIGIT made his first effective appearance in the House-" Ah ! " here at last is one of those terrible men of '32 r" Mr. BBIGHT and Mr. CoBDEN are the only two instances which occur to us of men who have realized the anticipation, and of the two there is no doubt that Mr. BRIanT is the one who had earned for himself by far the higher position in the House. Mr. CoBDneS name is associated imperishably with one great question, but out of that, it would be admitted, we presume, even by his immediate admirers, that he had not attained the same general reputation for high oratorical power as Mlr. BRIGHT.
It is needless to say that the views of MIr. BRItGHT on many political subjects, and, we believe, upon all questions connected with the foreign and military policy of the country, have ever been essentially different from those which we have advocated. We cannot, however, in the hour of his trial and affliction, consent to turn upon a man who had attained so eminent a position. Who among those who rail most loudly at JoH BRIGrr will ever do one tithe of what he has done, even with all the adventitious circumstances of birth and wealth upon their side t We are always ready and eager to give olur tribute of admiration to any person connected with the upper ranks of English society who displays any extraordinary amount of ability, any great degree of courage, any peculiar aptitude for the public service; but why should we of the middle classes be ever affiliated to a huge secret conspiracy for keeping down our own peers? That Mr. BRIGHn was hotbeaded at times and impracticable in his views, we admit, but then it should be remembered that the questions which have mainly occupied the attention of tho House for the last five or six years have just been of that sort which would try his impracticability to the quick, without giving scope for the display of, his more effective qualities. The man was in a false position. Had there been the remotest chance that his views could have been carried out in practice, he himself would no doubt have started back in amazement and disgust when he saw tneir consequences upon the eve of fulfilment. When hialf-a-dozen prophets find themselves opposed to a majority of 600 it is astonishing with what vigour they wiiU maintain their protest against the wickednesg of the times. Put a prophet, however, at the head of the Board of Trade, and, if he were a man of real ability, he..would, St onoe deseend from his, altitudes tnd transct the buiness of his department;in. a satisfactory msane*- That we believe would huve been 16.
ILrehes case.
iVWhen the late election for hSbuchte,r wa a
yet undecided, we ventured to offer a few xuggestions in Mr. BiarnT's favour, which have, as we have been informed, drawn upon us the displeamure of many of our friends in that city. It would, we still think, have been in better taste -more graceful, and more generous-had they allowed the necessary rupture, if rupture ther was to be, to come from Mr. BRaiGn, instead of from them. Of his great abilities and gret servioe there could be no doubt, and as little that the affliction which has lately falen upon him was the result of over-exertion in public life. It was, however, competent to them to say that the interests of the Borough and of the House could not be reconciled withrthe continuous absence of one of their mombern from his Paxliamentary duties. This appeora to have been their view in part, and in part their resolution has depended upon their strong desire to free the Borough from the electoral tyrauny of the League. We know not if there be any more private and personal causes, but at any rate the blow has fallen, and Mr. BRIaGHT, as far as Manchester is concerned, is banished from the House of Commons. We foresee a time when even Machester may desire once more the services of that eloquent tongue and that resolute heart. Surely, the present House of Commons is aristocratio enough and " territorial" enough for all useful purposes, and we might have found our advantage in the presence of the bold Tribune who might even at times be over-fervid in attack. We believe Mr. BuIGHT to have been conscientious in his views-no man could have produced the effect he produced upon his fellows without a great amount of earnestness and real conviction. We know him to have beent one of the most eloquent men in the House of Cormnons, and As a man of high ability we regret his loss. We are not to be reckoned among MIr. BroiGes political friends; but let him feel satisfied that there are thousands of his political opponents who would rejoice equally with his friends at his full restoration to health and to his public career.
The Report addressed to the Committee of Privy
The Report addressed to the Committee of Privy Council for Trade " npon the Accidents which have " occurred on Railways during the year 1856" commences with a sum total of the number of zacidents in the year-viz., 281 killed, and 394 injured. If we take the latter number to include, as doubtless it does, many who die, and die no long time after, from the accidents they have met with, this is at least an average of a death per day on the railway area of the country. The first remark, then, we have to maLe is, that we cannot call this a satisfactory announcement. It cannot but strike everybody that, considering the great advantages we have in invention, skill, and material, this is a very high average, and that we ought not to be satisfied till it is made much lower. It is true, when we examine the composition of this average, that we find its height is raised by foreign caues, and that part of it may be called irrelevant. Trespass upon railways is only accidentally a raiway cause of death, because the railway is not used as a railway in this case, but contrary to its design and against express rule. Still, so far as even trespassers are killed for want of more perfect machinery, such as a better drag, the railway shares with the unfortunate trespasser the fault of the death. A certain part, however, of the tespass deaths, in number 67, is an unfair swell of the average as against railways. We can hardly say the same of another cause of deathslevel crossings, which have produced 28 deaths. Here thera is no trespass, and the cause of death is not foreign, but is strictly and properly a railway cause, belonging to a regular arrangement connected with the "permanent way." We need not, of course, say that the existence of so veryawkwArd and, in the technical sense, " nasty' an arrangemnent as level cromsings, imposes on railways a very serious responsibility wherever these crossings admit of being looked after. A large pro-. portion of them are, indeed, wholly out of control, being only passages from one field to another; but those on public roads may be looked after strictly.
Again, the travelling world will, perhaps, be restored to a sense of security when it is informed that out of the 281 railway deaths last year only 27 were those of passengers, and of those 19-were owing to the carelessness of the persons themselves, though the numbers of injured, 298, will be some balance the other way. Bat it must be remembered that whatever reduces the fatality in the cas of passengers raises it in the case of another section, the class of servanta and employes of the railways, of whom 142 were killed last year, though of these, we are told, 112 deaths were owing to " misconduct or want of caution" on the part of the persons themselves.
But now to turn to the question of remedies. The Report before us speaks hopefully about the prospect of reducing this list of casualties. One great cause of Railway Accidents is the number of trains, and the consequent rapidity with which they succeed one another. " On some of the main
lines of railway the traffic has grown so large as "to require from 20 to 25, or possibly more, trains "in each direction in 24 hours." This rapid succession would cause little difficulty if the Speed of all the trains were the same. But the goods? trains alternate with the passenger trains, and have therefore to be passed by their pursuers. In this intricate state of things unpunctuality in one traim is apt to put a whole succession of trains into disorder, and collisions ensue. One remedy for this, then, is a third line of rails,-an addition which, we are told, the London and NorthWestern contemplates making between Bletchley and London. But such a remedy as this would involve a large outlay. One readier at hand is the electric telegraph, -which can act as a continual reviser of the timne-table, putting off the next train according as the lateness of the preceding one may want delay. This is the plan adopted on the Newr York and Erie Railway .-" The line is " divided into sections, and upon each section, in "some convenient situation, is placed an officer "called a ' Train Despatcher,' to whom the time "at which every train arrives at, departs from, or "passes each station, is telegraphed." The trains are thus regulated by space as well as timLe, the " Train Despatcher" having constantly a map before him giving him the position of every train on the line.
Another great cause of accidents is tho inadequacy of break-power. "The high speed and " heavy trains now in daily use on railways ren" der this question one of the first importance." At present, even the distant signal is sometimes unable to check a pursuing train, which goes on fully aware that there is an obstructing train before it, but unable to stop itself. Haa the enginedriver the power of checking his train within three or four hundred yards a very large majority of our accidents might, according to this Report, be avoided; but our present break has not this power, or anything like it. The operation of the " heavy break van" is slow, besides the weight which it adds to the train. Our high speed requires the application of a number of breaks instantaneously to all the wheels of a train, Ea a substitute for the present application of, the- whole br-eak-powrer to one point-a plan whieh: stints your quantity of break-power, besdes being muchi more injurious to the " permanentK*ay. It It'a be Wdded that a system Qf breaks comneie
througUout the train would facilitate the adoption of means of communication between the enginedriver anid the guail,-au advantage which all tho railWays in the United States poe, but. very fevr of our owin,
Another cause of accidents admits of a very simple remedy. It is, that the signs are "s et c at danger," snd altered when no danger is Spparent at the time of a train approaching. This breeds an insensibility to the danger signs] the continuance of which is often not obsberve
When4 contrary to what usually happens, the signal is continued. Iudced, an habitual zdis. regard of caution-ignals is common. "I
"the case of an accident at Welwyn, on the "Great Northern ailway, the firemen tati "that they were in the habit of passing the "caution-signal at a speed of 35 or 40 miles an 'hour." Another cause of accidents has a still simpler remedy. The watches of the railway servants are often what ancient vulgarity used to call " turnips," and do not tell that most important tIhing for railways.time. The natural remedy for this , that the railway should provide these articles, and secure this invaluable faculty.
The summing up of the Report i that pure accident, as distinguished from all remediable causes, reigns in but a small proportion of the disasters on railways. But thi is, after all, a poor consolation, unless we first know 'what is meant by remediable causes. There is one great cause and
root of railway disaster which cannot be called irre \ mediable, but which, as a matter of fact, never wia be remedied-and that is individual carelesnes. Do what you will, there will always be a certain amount of imprttdence in passengers and railway servants. Though a better selection, then, and a tighter discipline will give you a more prudent and cautious class of railway servants, you cannot look to this quarter for your principal source of improved safety, because you cannot alter the human mind; but you have power over nature, anad cn improve the mechanical arrangements of the railway indefinitely. A freeer and more masterly use of the telegraph, a better break-power, and an improved plan of signals would of themselves go a considerable way in improving railway safety. Captain DOUGLAS GLTroN, however, who has drawn up this Report, as well as that on AmericanRailwrays, to whichwehavemore than once had to call attention, is against the attempt to governi railways by legislative enactment& "A railway:
'is so comPlicated an instrument that it is not. "probable accidents would be prevented by "legislative enactments to adopt particular modes "of working, or to provide specified accessories to"safety." His argument is, that such interference would deprive the railway companies of their vittIitY as well as relieve them of their responsibility as managing bodies, making them only the servile executors of specific plans, and therefore retarding, instead of advancing, the progress of
improvement.
Without setting up for the reputation of prophets,
Without setting up for the reputation of prophets. we cannot help reminding our readers that a few weeks since a warning appeared in these columns against the employment of a certain unlucLy craft called the Transit in the conveyance of troops and. stores to the Chinese Seas. This vessel has, we believe, a character of its own among those acquainted with the Transport Service, and is celebrated beyond even the average of Government vesels for its inability to perform any task allotted to it in decent time, or, indeed, in any time at all. Some of our readers may remember its name in connexion with the great naval solemnity of last year. The Transit was the steamer in which the hereditary branch of the Legislature embarked on the 23d of April last, full of eager curiosity and patrioticpridd,-destined, alas ! to disappointment and mortification. We need not recall
the fate of the Peerage on that day,-how the en-. gines of the Transit broke down, if, indeed, they, were ever in order; how screw and helm refused their office; how she never got out of Southampton Water; how the Lords were entirely deprived of all that accurate and instructive representation of a Baltic campaign which the great naval review so properly supplied. What the Transit has been doing since is known only to tho authorities; but now, after the lapse of a year, she turns up again. It was natural that a vessel with so sugzestive a name-though, as experience proves, sadly misapplied-should be selected for the conveyance of men and material on an emergency. The Transit was accordingly ordered to be got ready for China. The old acquaintances of the vessel were somewhat xtaggered; but, of course, in these things inter. ference is impertinence, and criticism caviUing. On Tuesday afternoon she took her departure from Portsmouth for Hongkong with 80O officers and men of the 59th and 60th Regiments, a mail, and a large quantity of shot and shell. On Wednesday morning she returned to Spithead almost in a sinking state. We may well congratate the country and the friends of the troops on board that the accident which brought her back took place before she had been 24 hours at sea. Had she knocked a hole in her bottom at some anchorage on a coast less hospitable than that of the Channel, we might have had to recount a disaster as terrible as any in maritime annals. The history of the affair appears to have been as folows :-The vessel encountered a fog on approaching the Needles. The lead was kept going, and at last she anchored in five fathoms. The position was said to be a good one, and not a soul on board was suspicious of the least mishap; but at dawn the next morning the Transit was discovered to have 6 feet water in her hold. The anchor was weighed, and found to have half the stock carried away. The explanation was obvious. The ship had been driven on her own anchor, and a hole had been knocked in her bottom. When 9 feet water had been reported the captain put back to Spithead. The troops were transferred to another vessel, the mail sent back to the Post-office, and the powder and Lhell taken out to prevent her from sinldng. Engines were set to work to keep her afloat, and by this time she is in dock for inspection and repair.
This little episode in our new war warns us how to expect that the lemons of two years ago have taught us the right way of doing everything. The whole proceeding as it is described is, in fact, thoroughly Crimean, and recalls us to 1854. The choice of a ship which had failed more than once in short trips to carry 800 men a distance of 16,00O
miles, the management which knocL-ed a hole in the bottom at night and did not find it out till morn-
ing, the delay which must now take-) place at a tine -when every day is precious, ar
matters which may well renew the irritability and. impatience of the country. We have no deaiti to impute blame where it cannot be shown to be due, but certainly, considering the immense resources of our dockyards, the great number of Wips or all kinds which the late war has left jig, and the knowledge which our officers ought to have acquired during the last three years, auch an 'occurrence as the bare escape of 80 Xen from deatructioa a few hours after quitting the English shores does eem inconsistent xith the presumption of proper supervision an4 management. We trust that this Chineo empeii,on, for whicl: -the authoritiesb hayv.tme, maIt d money i. plety,, aDd tierefore can urp- n esewue for det. ciency, :may not again be iflb&- by wac*a, X6ahap Ai the narrow J gI 1 tQn ing - ~~~uwroait,on4rng0I*_

Although the weatber was extremelyunpleasnt, there Wa a lrg concourse of people present-estimated at from 4,000 to 5,000.
lMr. XALCOLM GEDDES proposed Mr. Shaw; Mr. PKrrz MVRDOCa seconded the nomination.
br. HENDERsON, of Bilbster, moved, and Baille WA.aEMS WICK seconded, the nomination of Lord Jobn Hay.
Ar. SHW then came forward, and was received with cordil cheers fror tho crowd. His address was chiefly an ,explanation of his corresp.ondence with local parties~ and the reasons which had induced him to come forward in oppositionto Lord John Hay after having withdrawn in hLs
favour.He 3maintained that there was a distinct tnderstanding bet veen him and his Lordship that in the event of lr. Laing retiring, whicia was in some degree anticipated owing to the state of Mr. Laing's health, he (Mr. Shaw) would again come forward. He therefore called on Lord John Hay to relieve auy electors who preferred hini,, and who had pledges themselves to his Lordshipundertheso circurmstances. he would make little reference to his views on pubhi questions, having in his published addresz and at A recent public meeting entered at length upon them. He was a thorough Labera, in favour of the 40s. freehold movement, and against the Mavnooth grant; was favourable to the vote by ballot, and in favour of Lord Palmerston's foreig poicy.
Lord Josn- HAY then proceeded to addteis the meeting, and was received with nmingled cheers and hisses. li, admitted that he was under the impression that Mr. Shaw would stand in the event of MIr. Aing retiring ntimL he received Mr. Shaw's unconditional with.lrawal fromthe contest, after which he denied thero was any understauding to the effect held by Mr. Shaw. He denied that he was the nominee of the fluke of Sutherland, or rny oneels ; but had ke solicited the interest of Sutherland he should be only doing what his vacillating friend had done, for he had solicited the influence of that potent northern magnate. Alluding to public questions, he said he was himself a supporter of Liberal measures in the widest sense of the term.
Although approving Lord Palmerston's conduct in the. affairs of ChIna, andhis general foreign policy, herepudiated the idea of giving to Lord Palmerston, or any other, a blind and unqualified support. Hewasin favour of such a gradual reform in those portions of the institutions of our country which were defective as would keep pace with the growing wealth, influence, and inteligence of the community. He was in favour of economy In the public expenditure so far as was consistent with public safety and efficiency-particularly regarding the army and navy. He yedged himself to give an honest and faithful attention to the local interests of the Burghs, which he hoped to represent, particularly in regard to harbour aecommodation. He could not promise to build a harbour for themi but he wrould do all that was in hispower to obtain one.
In answer to questions from the opposite side of the huttind Ird Johan expressed himself as oDposed to the
4. freold movement, opposed to the aboition of fl exng i,n the army snd; navy, nan opposedto vote by ballot as Deing nn-British. e Hwished everything fair and open. He was decidedly in favour of promotion by merit, and a separation of Wick and Mirklala from the other burghs in the group.
The Shs.er declared the show of hands to be in favour of Mr. Shaw.

LANARKMHI.-The 2orth B)itXA Daily ZMai grandiloquently says of Mr. Baillie Cochrane's signal defeat:-" We claim for this grand event the foremost and highest place among all the wonderful results of this general election. Nowhere has the independence of the electoral body been so
roudly vindicated; nowhere has the power of publlo opinion Cn so grandly and powerfully displayed as in Lanrk. shire. within the last few years the Duke of Hamilton. deserting the hereditary politics of his family, has carried over to this seemingly flourishing cause no small portion of the county. How the Tories chuclded when they thought of this great windfalL But, alas ! the Hamilton influence, which was supposed to secure the county to Toryism for ages, has proved the fly in the pot of ointment. With a register prepared for so many yers according to their will, and with a combination of landed influence on their side, such as had never before been seen in the county, who could possibly stand against the Tories ? There were only a few Liberals, with a good cause, with great plusk, with the might that slumbers in a peasant's arm, and with that p3,wer of conscience and that love of independence which are never wanting in a Scotch constituency to plaoe in antagonism to all this array of influence and favouritism ef law and fortune. The Hamilton farmers responded to the call of their master. With the exception of two or tbree independent men, that great tenantry went to the poll, and voted directly opposite from what they had ever voted before. Mr. Baillie Cochrane had the satisfaction, therefore, of being supported by the right men in the right' place. These Hamilton voters were the parties who were calculated upon to sell the pass, but as fast as the tenants of the Duke appeared at the poll stalwart freemen started up at Glasgow, at Biggar, and in Avondale, and crushed' them down ito the imbecility and darkneas in which they will henceforth be doomed to pass their political existen,

The- result of the county elections, so far Oa they were actually known up to Thursday morning, showed a balance in favour of the Opposition, but still there is reason to

MB. BRAGHTS FAREWALL ADDRESS.
To TnF ELECRS OF THE CITY OF CEM%I7rR
Gentlemen,-I hxve received a telegraphic despatch informing me of the result of the election contest in which yoU have just been engaged. That result has not greatly sorprised me; and so far as I am personally concerned, insmnuch as it hberates me from publio life in a manner which involves on my part no shrinking from my duty, I cannot seriously regret it. Ilament it on publio grounds, becAuse it tells the world that many among you have abandoned the opinions you profeased to hold In the year 1847 and even so recently as in the year 1852. I believe that slander itself has not dared to charge me with having forsaken any of the principles on the honest support of which I offered myself twice, and was twice accepted as your representative. The charge against me has rather been that I have too warmly and too faithfully defended the political views which found so much favour with you at the two previous elections
It the change in your opinion of me has arisen from my course on the question of the war with Russia, I can only say that, on a calm review of al the circumstances of the cae-and during the past 12 months I have had ample time for such a review-T would not unsay or retract any one of the speeches I have spoken, or erase from the records of Parliament any one of the votes I have given upon it, if I could thereby reverse the decision to which you have come, or secure any other distinotion which it is in the power of my countrymen to confer. I am free, and will remain free, from any share in the needless and guilty bloodshed of that nielancholy chapter in the annals of my country. I cannot, however, forget that the leaders of the Opposition in the recent oontest have notbeen influenced by my conduct on this question. They were less successful, but not less bitter in their hostility in 1852, aud even in 1847, when my only public merit or demerit con. slted in my labours in the cause of free trade. On each occasion, caling them selves Liberals, and calling their candidates Liberals also, theyhave coalesced with the Conservatives, while now, doubtless, they have awailed Mr. Gibson and myself on the ground of a pretended coalition with the Conservatives in the House of C ommons I
I have esteemed it a high honour to be one of your sepresentatives, and have given-more of mentaland physical labour to your servioo than was just to myself. I feel it scarcely less an honour to suffer in the cause of peace, and on behalf of what I believe to be the true interest of my country, though I could have wishod that the blow had come from other hands, at a time when I could have been present to meet face to face those who dealt it.
In talkng my leave of you, aud of public life, let me assure you that I can never forget the many, the innumerable, kindnesseaI have received from inyfrietrdl among son. No one will rejoice more than I shal in all that brings yon prospenty and honour; and I am not,without a hope ths4t when a cer bour shall cone you, will say of Mr. Gibson and of me that, as colTeagues in your representition for 10 years, we have not sacrificed our principles to pain popularity, or bartered our independence for the emoluments of officeor the favours of the grehi.

BERLIN, APmIL 7.
While in my preoeding letter I desCribed the abolition of a peculuir corps in the Ruasau Army, and the renunciation of a system £ppsreltly about to be revived by the late . peror, you will find in the following the rapid extension by the present, Emperor of an organization commenood by his father. I allude to the Rifles or Sharpahooters. This body is not to be, confoundod with] the Jiager regiments ivhich existed previously, but were however nothing else than Fusileer regiments, standing in ithe. same relation. to the Musketeer regiments as infantrit legire does to infanterie de la lig i. e., they differed from..each other in little more than in theil buttons and facings.
: All the 42 regiments of Jagers, it may be mentioned here, have ceased to exist as a separate arm, and have been ranged in the same list with, the 42 infantry, or Musketeeir regiments, with which they now form 84 regiments. They have, in consequence of this new arrangement, all received fresh *eri4 numbers, and the Jiagers have been allowed to retain the names they boreof certain provinoes, towns, or battles. The Carabineers have also met with the 6ame fate as the Jfigers. They stood in the samn relation to the Grenadiers as the Jagers did to the Musketeers (they 'wore black facings, while the Grenadiers and Mlusketeers wore white), but in v eosential matters they were as near as possible the sae.
To return, however, to the Rifle Out: of the one single regiment that the Emperor Nicholas had at the commencement ofhiareign-wiz., theEinland, iRifies of the Body Guar4-have arisen no leas than 54 battalions, besides the company of Rifle
or Sharpshooters attached to every battalion of infantry as a fifth company. General Eatuay, ther present commander of the separate Grenadier corps, was the Emperor's right hand in the formation of theee battalions of Rifles. An ardent 'and enthu. siastic votay of the Rifies, he devoted himself to the task with auch aour that results were ob tained totally dieproportioned to the time they occupied. His first attempts however, were rendered fjatile by the Emperor Ritchola'sa notion, that these battlions of Rifles 'could best be raise& among -the cantonists; or enfans de troupe, foundecL on the supposition thit their better education and habits of life would render them, Epecially apt at this weapon, which, more than any other, requires smartness, alertness, and a certain degree of handiness. A very short experience having shown these youths to be totally unequal to, thie exertions General Ramsay required of them, the Emperor, though with great regret, abandonec. his idea of thus turning them to good account; and,, perceiving that nothing but the hardiest materials would answer the purpose, he allowed the battalions to be raised among the Tschuwasches, the TscheremiMes, and other tribes whose occupation is more especially the chase; and this time the experiment succeeded entirely. The Rifle companies attached to the different infantry regiments were, on the otherhand, formed by ielecting from each company firstof allthesix bestniarkamen, andthenincreasing this number gradually to 24 per company. Thlle aggregate of these picked marksmen forms now the. 6th company attached to every battalion (regiment). of infantryunuder thenameof RiflesorSharpshootera.
Over and above these, there remaini to be mentioned the Rifle Regiment of the Imperial family, originally projected to consist of four battalions, but subsequently confined to three. This regiment received a peculiar and, exceptional position in the. military system, inasmuch as it wFas placed neither* under th~e Minister of War nor under the inspeclar" of the' Rife force, but under the Minister of the Imperal Eouse. It was raied on the Crown-. domains from among the Crown peasantry, and' numbered in its muster-roll a large portion of the, officials of the domains, the foresters, rangers, &ac.
Now, let us see how these recent creations of the late and present Emperor have been adjusted into the new organization which Alexander IL has given_ to his army.
Of the three, battations of the Rifle Regient of the Imperial family only one has been retainqd,
chielly as -a inement6 of the occasion which led to its. being raised. It is held' to. beloDg to the Guard, but is not attached to any particular division. Its commander 'is Pince Galitzin, and the list of its officers contains many brilliant names.'
nthe place of the one Fland battalion of the Rp1les of the Guard there are now three, the first of which is attached to the 1st division of the Infantry of the Guard, the second to the 2d division, and the 3d .(which retains the name Finland) to the 3d. division.
llch of the three Grenadier divisions of the Grenadier corps has now a battalion of Grenadier' Rifles attached to it.
In addition to these, the Emperor has just lately while at Zarskoe-Selo, ordered the formation of a" normal company of Rifles, under the command of Captain Baron vol Korff, who has spent much time of late in studying the most recent improvements made in this arm in other countries.
As a reserve to these 18 battalions there exist at present only two reserve Rifle battalions, in conseqluence of the men composing the original four reserve and two supplementary Rifle battalions having been draughted off to make up the complement of the 18 Rifle battalions of the main army.
Attached to the separate Caucasian Corps therea are now one Caucuian Grenadier Rifle battalion, the 19th, 20th, and 21st Rifle battalions attached to the Infantry divisions bearing the same serial number, and one Cauacasian Reerve Rifle battalion.
Out of the six Rifle battalions of the six Infantry corps (now called Armte Corps) there have beenr formed 18 battalions, one of which is attached to each of the 18 Infantry divisions of the so-called "First Army," or main army.
The gm battalions of Rifles that were raised in Finland out of the ci.d&vsnt Swedish Indelta troops have been increased to mine; they stand under the inspectorship of Major-General von Koden, and, in addition to their own serial number, bear the names of the towns where theiirheadquarters are stationed -Abo, Wasa, Uleaborg, Knopa, St. Michael, Tawarthus, Bjerneborg, Njuland, and IViborg. A normal Rifle battalion is the school in which these nine battalions are trained.
Although the four ci-derain normal Carabineer regiments are not reckoned officially as belonging to the PRifles or Sharpshooters, they must, nevertheless, be mentioned here as forming part of that force, inasmuch as the Emperor has taken away from them their former serial nuamber which they bore as Carabineers, and has named therm Normal Rifle ragiments. They were raised among the cantonnists of the Nowogrod military colonies, and form a separate body, under the instruction of LieutenantGeneral Troloff.
The Rifle force of the Russian army consists, then, of the following:-
L Attached to the Guard. 4 2. Attached to the Grenadier Corps. ... 3 3. Attached to the Sixth Arm' Corps ... 1S 4. Attached to the Caucasian Corps ... 4 5. Reserve battalions ... ... ... ... 3 6. Fibland battWlions (Indelta), ineluding
NormalBattalion... ... ... ... 10
T. Normal Rifle-Battalion . .... 12
Toea ,., ... ... 54
Simply taEken numerically, this Rifle force far exceeds that of all other armieis ;but, with regard to its professional effieiineY and skill in the use of its arms, somne time must yet elap*e, as
those who know it well and are disposed to-forno unfavourable opinion of it maintain, before the Rtnmeia Rifles or Shhrpshootera will- be able to vie with those of older formation in other armies In the meantime no pains *re being spared to biing it- tapidly forward in efficiency and milit&ry skill.
Oh onedprelimixiai* question, however; milit - mfen in Russia- have~ by -no means arrived at a harmonious conclusion as yet-viz., whether suchl troop, possessed of peculiarly gooa aim and long rAng ,-should be usedarather as infantry of pOeition

PARIS, APRtL 8, 6 par.
The Neuchhtel Conference has not met to-day, nor is it certain it will sit to-morrow. If not as important, this paltry affair threatens to occupy as much time and give as much trouble as the Rus3ian protocols. The question of money is, it seems, the present difficulty. The King of Prussia, like a man of business, is anxious to make as good a thing of it as possible, and he higgles more about his bargain than did M. de Veron about the sale of the
mondstituionnei and the Pays, or M. Girardin about the Presse. His Majesty might take a lesson of liberality in such matters from either of the fortunate sellers, but he will try to squeeze as much as he can out of poor Switzerland.
A private letter from Turin of the 4th states that ihe departure of the Austrian Minister and the rapture of diplomatic relations with Vienna produced but a slight impression in the former city. The Sardinian Government will remain firm, though quiet and moderate, unless wantonly provoked, and wanton provocation from Austria it does not antici, pate. This refers only to overt hostilities, but little doubt is felt that active intrigues will be set on foot to drive M. Cavour from office. At this moment AustWa would prefer seeing M. Mazzini or some equally ardent politician at the head of affairs, at whose instigation P?iedmont might commit some indiscretion. A project of law wil soon be presented to the Chambers for the organization of the National Guard. The moveable contingent will comprise young men from 18 years to 28, the fixed from 18 to 50, and the reserve from 18 to 54. It is thought that the moveable contingent will amount to from 30,000 to 40,000 men.
The various rumours which have circulated for the last few days about an attempt on the Emperor's porson are, I am assured, totally unfounded. The only thing that is certain is the fact I have already mentioned of several arrests having taken place in Paris and some of the departments, connected with the secret societv of which I have also given you some details. The arrests have, no doubt, given rise to these reports about " attentats," which are untrue.
The public has received with approbation the decision of the Council of State in the case of the Bishop of Moulins. The exception is of course the party that would place the clerical power far above the law, that would admit no appeal from ecclesiastical authority, and would recognize no supremacy, nor even equality, in a lay tribunaL The more influential, as the most intolerant organ of that party, the Univers, has sullenly registered the decree in its columns, without a single observation. Those who ought to be grateful, however, are the inferior clergy, whom it protects against the aggressions of their superiors. The decree does not affect the Bishop of Moulins only *it condemns the whole of the Provincial Councils that have received the Synodal Statute which pronounces excommunication ipso facto, and without previous notice, on all who presume to appeal to the secular power for support or protection in what concerns the jurisdiction, statutes, charges, and other cecclesiastical regulations touching benefices, titles, &c. Moreover, the Government from whom such a check emanates is not one that has tyrannized over or persecuted the clergy. On the contrary, it is one which, since its establishment, has found it its interest to gain their affection and devotion. It is said that, notwvithstanding the order of the Council of State anld the decree of the Emperor, the matter wil still be arranged. I do not well see how any arrangement, otherwise than by the resignation of the Aishop of Moulins, is possible. Had it been the case of a prelate who was harshly treated by the secular power, but who still retined the attachment of his clergy and the affections of the people of his diecess, he might refuse to abandon his post; but M. de Dreux-Brez cannot fall back on any such support. He may be looked upon as a martyr by such of his episcopal brethren as Would imitate his conduct and sympathize with his notions of church government, but it is not probable that the inferior clergy, who have suffered from a rule which until now they have borne in silence, or the people, whose indignation might soon have become still stronger, will not rejoice at the lesson that has been administered to him. It would be impolitic to leave him in his diocess, for a man who is the object of general odium can never hope to instruct with profit or to edify. The Concordat is the law of the land- the Bishop of Moulins has clearly violated it; and that violation is aggravated by the way in which he extorted from his clergy the resignation of their cures previous to their nomination whenever caprice prompted him to demand it. What the Court of Rome may think about the matter it is not difficult to say, but the Emperor will probably console himself for any new difficulties about the coronation with the satisfaction that this act of justice will have produced among the general body of the inferior clergy.
An act of severity, unworthy as impolitic, took place, I understand, on the occasion of tho funeral of Madame de Larochejacquelein a month or two ago. That funeral was attended by an immense concourse of people from Orleant, where she died, from the country which was the theatre of her former sufferings and her devotion to a family mot very remarkable for gratitude to its adherents; and the remains of the venerable lady were followed to the grave by hundreds who never sympathized in the cause for which she underwent so many dangers and made so many sacrifices, and to whom the white cockade is but a tradition. They paid the tribute of their respect to one so worthy of it, and merely honoured heroic courage and unchanged loyalty, without thinking of the cause for which they were exhibited. Among those who attended thefuneral of Madame deLarochejaqueleinwere some functionaries or agents of the Government, whose devotion to it, we may presume, is sincere, as they receive its pay and wear its uniform. They had no notion that a mark of respect paid to one who, long before her death, had the rare advantage of becommng an historical personage, and whom all partLes have long united in admiring, was an offence, or that such an act would be regarded as a demonstration in favour of Henry V. They were, it seems, mistaken. Their conduct was viewed with displcan,re by their superiors, and visited with punishment. Some, I believe, were dismissed from their employment, and others removed to a distant post-such removal, when it is lot from promotion, being considered as equivalent to censure. The case was so hard that the Marquis de Larochejacquelein, the son of the deceased lady, took the matter up. The Marquis, who considers hiraself to have been badly treated by the persons in whose cause his family made so many sacrifices, and who was for so many years the political adversary of the Orleans rsgime, has, as you are doubtless aware, long since adhered to the Imperial Government, and accepted the functions of
lenator. The Marquis, whom a severe attack of illness prevented from being present at the funeral of his mother, felt deeply the conduct of the authorities in punishing those whose only offence was to show her respect. lHe remonstrated, as he ought, and, I believe, tendered his resignation as Senator; he was not obliged, however, to go this length; his remonstrances were attended to, and the offending parties were restored to their places.
This absurd incident I do not put to the Emperor's account. I do him the justice to believe that it was without his consent or knowledge that it occurred, and that it was the sAontaneous
act of some over-zealous functionary, v/ho thought that it would procure him favour in high quarters. There are few characters who have more claims to sympathy and reapect from al parties than Madame deLarochejacquelein, and the pages in which she has traced the- narrative of her sufferings and her dangers in the cause of fallen Royalty possess an attraction which is not surpassed by those of Mrs. Hutchinson, who is also the historian. of an heroic husband and his chivalrous independence. Madame de Larochejacquelein could not be hated by the most violent Republican, She has told tha story of her frienda and her enemies, but in these attractive memoirs she has not passed over without eulogium the in-
stances of heroism or kind and compassionate feel1nsz which were found among the Republicas, ad she has confessed, with a simplicity that charms, the fault, even the crimes, which disgraced the ip^. sirgents of the Bocages. In these memoirs there is no trace of bitte-ness against thoe who forced her and hers to become wanderers, and even remote spectators Sind it difficult after aw lapse of many year

plays. It is therefore highly improba'ble 'tliat- the removal of the functionaries whose only sin was to follow the remain8 of such a' person to thegrave could have been with the knowledge' of the Emperor. Indeed, the satisfaction so apeedily accorded would lead u to suppose that it was not so.
A letter from Genoa, of the 3d inst., states that discord has reached the highest pitch between the two branches of the house of Bourbon, and all at-' tempts to accomplish a fusion have completely failed, particularly since the unfortunate letter written by the Count de Chambord to'the widow of M. de Salvandy. Some members of the faraily are at present at Sesto-Ponente, for the purpose of concerting with the Duchess of Orleans iand the Count de Paris the course to be pursued in the event of certain contingencies more or less remote.

M. A. Leroux has undertaken to present his report to the Chamber by the 1st of May, as the Government and Chamber both desire that no prolongation of the session should take place. The Committee on the Budget is now discussing the new taxes, and everything favours the impression that it will come to the same conclusion as the Council of State, and that nothing will be changed with regard to the 15c. on transferable securities.

AUSTRIA
(rnex OUR OWN~ coAnnnSAOrwsA)
7 4ENA Arnir 6.
Although she is one of the great o i uropeance Powvers, anAd possesses a most forAmidable army, Austria is alarmed because 20,000 Sardinian soldiers are about to form a camAp near the fortress of Ales. sandria. Instead of stating in a couple of lines a fact which in reality is of little or no importance, the Ost-Deutsche Post, a non-official organ of the Austrian Foreign-office, thus writes:-
" At the moment in which Austria complained of certain hostle demonstrations at Turin the Sardinian Chamber considered it opportune to discuss the question of the build. iig of the fortress of Alessandria. This was not a demon. stration, it was mere chance. When Count Paar informed the Sardinian Minister that the Mlarquis of Cantono was at liberty to remain at his post in Vienna the latter was recalled. The step was not taken because Sardinia desired to bring about a rupture, but because her dignity required it. The TurinGovernment is now about to form a camp of 20,000 men near Alessandria. This, as we aretold, Is no demonstra. tion, but a military manounivro which takes plce every year. We are not so versed in the habits and customs of the Pledmentese srmy as to know whether such a concentration of troops takes place every year, and at this season, but this we know, that every temperate and cautious Govern. ment-every Goveirment wrhich was disinclined to give provocation and to cause alarm-would, under present circumstances, have preferred to delay the 'annually recurring evolutions' for a few months."
It is highly probable that General della Marmora resolved to pitch his camp in the neighbourhood of Alessandria in order toaoy Austria, and the Imperial Government ought, therefore, to have taken no other notice of such an empty denmonstration than to order its commander in Lombardy to keeD a watchful eye on the movements of his Sar. dinian neighbours. Austria has an army of 110,000 men concentrated in her own Italian States and in the Papal Legations, and, as her position in the Italian peninsula is amazingly strong, it is difficult to conceive why she condescends to notice the petty provocations of the Turin Cabinet. The ImDerIal Cabinet altogether ignores the affronts which it so continually receives from Russia, but it is exces. sively indignant whenever Sardinia makes a move on the political chessboard which is not to its taste. Some weeks before the diplomatic rupture actually took place between Austria and Sardinia it was said in my correspondence that it would be bad poliey if this Government should recall its diplomatic agent from Turin, and reliable letters which have, during the last day or two, been received from various parts of Italy confirm me in the opinion then expressed. One writer says:-
"It grieves me much to be obliged to confess that the state of public feeling here (in Lombardy) is nearly as bad as it was three months ago. The recent measure towards Sardinia has produced a very bad impression, and has induced the Lombards to believe that the Austrian Government has an inveterate and incurable antipathy to the Italian nationality. The Miianeso aro blinded by their prejudices, and consequently totally unable to make allowance for the morbid sensibility 'which Austria displays whenever the justioe of her olaims to the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom is impugned."
A second writer speaks of the discontent which has been caused by the " unusually large cons.,iption" in Venice and Lombardy; and a third deolares that the Venetians are extremely 'rdgi'nt that three millions of lire should have been advaneed by the State, at a very low rate of interest, to the Podesta Count Correr, who a few months ago was in great pecuniary difhultiMes Thereis atthis moment an unusual number of Sardinianofficers in Lombardy,
wahoe presence gives great umbrage to this Govern. mont, as very many of them are travelling in plain
clothes. The "sparringe between the Vienna I and Turin Cabinets is likely to continue, but there is little danger of their coming to blows, as France, England, Rusia, and Prussia are by no means in. clined to permit them to disturb the peace of Europe,
Yesterday it was rumoured that Baron de Bourqueney had asked Count Buol to permit a Parix Conference to settle the difference between Austria and Sardinia. The report in probably unfounded; but, if the French Ambasador did make such a proposition, you may be sure that it was peremp torily rejected.
The political excitement in the Danubian Princi palitie3 increases from day to day, and it cannot be doubted that the Wallachian Divan ad hoc will pronounce in favour of the iuion. The menibers of
the Moldavian Divan are likely to display somewhat. less unanimity than their Wallachian brethren, as many of them fear that Jasay-the present capital of Moldavia-would become a mere provincial town if the two Principalities should be mnited. The newest electioneering "dodge" in Wallahia is, that the more influential men have cards wuith their names in the centre, and the word. " Union," "Hereditary Prince," "P.e.
presentative Govnment," and ' Two Cxambers," prini in v cornzm The att ment tht.the

The Austrian military hierarchy is very wrafh -with -Count Waldensee, the Pruissijn Minister of War, for saying that 30,000 Austrian ioldiers hid died in G2llicia in 1854 and 1855, " as a con1squence of the hardships to which they were exposed." There is no reason to suppose that the soldiers were in want of the necessaries of life, but their quarters in the miserable huts of the peasants were in the highest degree insalubrious. The mea were also exposed to all the viciBsitudes of the weather, as they were daily employed in construct-
ing the railroad in the western part of Gallicia. The, complaint of which nine-tenths of the 30,000 men died was a most malignant typhus, vihich assumed the character of an' epidemic. An emigration-fever is now raging in the Tyrol, and many of the mountaineers have gone to Peru, because the Itframontane keepers of their consciences have told them that no good Catholics ought to pitch their tents in countries which, like America, are principally inL habited by Protestants. The increasing desire to emigrate is said to give serious annoyance to this Government. About a fortnight since the proprietress of one of the frst hotels in the suburb Leopoldstadt died suddenly of apoplexyr, and the priest who had been sent for expressed his indignation that he had been called from his bed to attend a corpse. A day or two afterwars a Jesuit missionary, in the Church of St. John, began .to preach at the relatives of the deceased, who had been renowned for her kindness to the poor, but such a murmur of indignation arose that the reverend gentleman was obliged to change his theme. About a year ago 50 or 60 sectarians calling themselves " Brethren of St. John" were arrested and sent to Mlosterneuburg, wherei they were delivered over,to the Cistercian Brethren, who were eharged to convinee them of the error of their ways. Most of the people were soon dismissed, but a couple of them are still in confinement, as they turned the tables on the clergy, and attempted to make proselytes in the convent.
The State baLaice-sheet for 1856 has not yet been published, but it is credibly stated that the deficit is about 125,000,0001L. The LombsvdoVenetian Railroad Company offers 70,000,000fl. for the Vienna-Trieste Railroad, but the State demands 10,000,000fl. more. The outlay for the line when completed-it will be opened next Augustwill be about 120,000,0001.
THIE APPREHENDED MURRAIN.
(aosrO OUR owN CoRUzsPoNDEN.)
HAMBURG, Arnm 7.
It is thought somewhat singular, if tot rather eccentric, on the part of the' British Government, that by the recent order in Council the importaton of cattle and raw hides from the Gulf of Finland, and the Russian, Prussian, Meckldenburg, and Lu beclk ports in the Baltic, into England should have been prohibited while the trade in oxen, &c., from those in Holstein and other provinces along the coast of the German Ocean and the Elbe should continue to be allowed, from which places, moreover, the greater portion of the diseased cattle would be exported to Great Britain, and but comparatively few from the Baltic, on account of the long voyage and greater cost and risk of transport. In short, if from the Prussian districts adjacent to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg, and from Mecklenburg itsel£,. and likewise from Lubeck, there have been any cattle sent to England, or likely to be sent at any time, they are generally transported thence overland to this port for shipment, arid there is even now nothing to prevent these shipments being made, as has heretofore been the case, in spite of a dozen British orders in Council,as long as theportsof the Elbe, Eider, aud Weser are excluded from their operation, for no one canpossiblyfindoutwhencethey comeforexportation to this place in particular, since the dealers are so well versed in the management of the business they. have in hand as to avoid the proper clue being giveni to their movements. The authorities here take care to prevent as much as possible any cattle passing into the Ramburg territory for the use of the. people, but the question is, will they interfere with any destined solely for exportation, and which do not concern them or the native population, who. have not to consume such meat if bad? And, if so, even could they rely upon the persons they employ ia looking after the cattle reporting correctly? At all-events these doubts deserve consideration, and e3pecially so since tender consciences are as easily imanaged hereand!men as blinded in the performance of duty as in other parts of Europe, and a number of murrained oxen in the first stage of the disease can beoas easily'put on board ships of transport to England include any other port conveniently situate, and not Icluded in any orderof Council prohibiting exportation thence.
Not a single word has been hinted in the prohibition in question about cattle from Holstein, I while it is notorious that the murrain among cattle
exists throughout the whole of the duchy, and is even on the increase than otherwise. And why not ? This appears certainly singular above all, and is looked upon as either an oversight or as showing a great want of information on the subject in relation to the murrain among cattle over here.
: SPAIN.
(FROM oUR OWN OOWBNrOR NDE.)
MADRID, ApRa 4.
The Mexican question continues to be the most prominent and important of those at present upon the tapis, but it has made no visible progress since I wrote to you concerning it on the 31st ult. It appears that Senor La Fragua hesitates to come to Madrid unless he be received here in his official I capacity, and that the English Government, which desires to see the quarrel made up, is endeavouring to overcome his scruples. As he has been as-sured that a friendly reception awaits him, that
the Spanish Government is well-disposed, and even desirous, to settle the matter amicably; and as he is doubtless aware that such settlement is most likely to be brought about by his presence in Madrid, it is not to be supposed that he will alow a point of etiquette, ora merely personal feeling, to stand in theway of the aooplishment of his important mission. If he did so, he would certainly be rendering an ill-service to his country; and it is difficult to believe that he would be acting in the spirit of his instructions. Spain
strong grounds of complaint; her subjects have been robbed,. ill-treated, and even murdered; and it would be in bad taste for the representative of the country where those outrages have ibeen perpetrated to put punctilious and unnecessary obstacles in the way of the reconciliation for 'which she shows herself willing.
The expectation continues strong that Senores Bravo Murillo and Beltran de Lis will, before long, head a new Government, whose policy will, of course, be retrograde, if it be not completely and avowedly Absolutist. Such a Ministry would probably muster a pretty stong party in the Congress. The Absolutist newspaper Regeneracim yesterday' reckoned up 62 members who it believes twll vote together in the Chamber and support
'what it calls religious-monarchical principle At )the head of these stand Bravo Murilo, Beltran !de ,is, and Canga Arguellas (the younger), and to them. may be added, as the Discusi~os} to-day iemarks, the waverersthose Moderados who are ~isontented with the prresent Government, and pvident that the present Government is weapand cannot last, we may expect to see numerous defections from the ranks of its present supporters.
Some of the persons (and these are not few) who permit themselves to discuss and speculate upon the chances of a change of dynasty in Spain have began, as I am infformed, to indulge a belief-begotten, probably, by their wishes
that England and France would witness such a change without repugnance or opposition. This Is, doubtless, an erroneous idea. To say nothing of the difficulties attending the selection of the new line, there can be no doubt that it is the desire and intention of both France and England to msintun the throne of Isabella so long as they can do Eo within certain limits of interference. As regard3 England, especially, it is not to be supposed that Lord Paluerston would stultify himself by favotring the destruction of that which he so long and earnestly laboured to constract. He may possibly now feel that he made a mistake when, in conjunetionxwitl Louis Philippe (whose selfish dynastic views in the affair were subsequently s9 - Completely unveiled), he thrus't upon this countrr an infant Sovereigm'*hd a fomi 'of government -foz whc-)it has proved itself wholly ujifitted.

,omie~ of' the newspapert organsof the Spanish Goveinment say that the anticipaled Carlist moveme~nt, th'e expectation of which has lately occasioned mOvenenls of troop3 and other precaution, has no reality as regards the Carlists themelves, but that, some of the principal of these declare that they have been urged by the Democratic party to repair-to the, northern and eastern provinces of Spain, where they would find arms, money, and men ready. to support the cause of Montemolin. There is every reason to, believe that these statements are utterly devoid of truth, and their appearance in Ministerial' journals tends to confirm..the belief entertained by many, £hat the alarm has been propagated, and the proposed riing instigated, by the Governnient itself.

Visit Of The Sultan To The Royal Albert.
VISIT OF THE SuLTAr TO THg ROYAL
A LBERT.
(Pso0T A. CORBJspoxDmN!D.1
The Btoal Albert sEifted her anchorage from Bujuder6, at the Black Sea end of the Bosphorus, to * position imme. diately opposite the Dolma Bakhcbi Palaoe, which has been recently erected for the Sultan at an enormous expense. On the afternoon of the 27th the Admiral issud an order which set at rest thiereports of the Sultan's intention to disit this ship :-Captains and ofliccrsof the squadron to repiron board-the in full dress, at 10 30 a.m. on Satuaymrig tfie' 28th, to receive the Sultan; ships to man yards, and the rigging on the port dide, that facing the Palacey shipa to be dressed at the same time; Tarkish flag at the main; the Royal Albert to hoist the Sultan's standard at the rain. The early part of Saturday mnorning was showery, but, with our ual good fortune, after 8 o'clock the weather cleared up quite fine. We made the best preparatiohs that we could in the shape of carpeting the ladders and declk, up to which His Majesty haji to go! Shortly before 11 o'clock the Pasha, who were tobe in attendance, came on board. They were Redsohid Pasha, GrandVizier;izaaPasa,z MinisterofWar; Mehemudt All Pasha, M1inibter of Marine; Omar Puaha, Generalissimo of the Army; and Ethem Pasha, inister of Foreign Affairs. Lord Stratford and saite came on board about the sauie time. About a quarter before 12 the Sultan wsa seen, to step into his caique. The ships immediately manned yards and rigging, dresdng with flags, and a salute of 21 guns was xt the same time fired by the Cmragoa and ourselves. The Marines formed the guard of honour on both sides of the quarter-deck, and presented a fine specimen of British troops. The band was across the poop, and the officers were standing on the after part of the quarter-deck. Six of the youngest naval cadets acted as side boys, two at the bottom of each ladder. The Sultan was reoived at the entry port on the middle deck by the Admiral, Ambassador, Pashas, and Captains of the fleet. He was conducted to the, upper deck by the Ambassador,. who was obh iiged to help him up the ladders, He wore the fez; 'with a button on the top, a loose over. eoat, the collar- and cuffs of which were a mass of diamonds worth about 50,0001. He appeared very much exhaueted and nervous, and did not eeem to be at all at ease. After he had recovered a little he threw open his coat so as to show the Riband and Star of the Garter, tellingthe Admiral that he felt proud to be able to wear it before so many "brave soldiers and sailors." A. chair was brought out for him, which he refused, saying in French, which he speaks fairly, " Je ne suispas fatigWu."
After ther usual complimentary speeches had been ex. changed the Admiral conducted him to the cabin, and after a short rest he again came on deck and walked forward. Returning he hoticed the Crimean medal on the breast of onie of theAMarines, and said he observed that all the men wore the same decoration. The Marine, poor fellow, was evidently very uncomfortable at having become so conspicuous. Whileonk decl; this time theSultanhadevidentlygot over his nervousness, and laughed and chatted a good deal, apparentlr taking considerable interest in all he saw. On returning to the'Admnial's cabin he requested theAdmira], Ambassador, and Pashas to be seated, a thing that I believe hasnever before taken place.. The Sultanthen begged Lord Lyonsto informHer Majesty the Queen how grateful hefelt for, the prompt assistance that had been rendered to his country, and for having sent such a man as the Admiral to be one of the defenders of Turkey. He afterwards paid the! Admiral a very handsome compliment. His Majesty said :-"I loved you when I first sawyou, and that affec. tiou and regard has since been increased by the nobleness of lour conduct, and'I feel that it is no smal thing to come on board such a shlp to see such a man; and I trnt
that, if agiin England become the defender of Turkey, your Sovereign Inay choose you, if your services can be spared, to again command the fleet, and I hope that You may long live to adorn the profession of which you are such a bright ornament." The captains and commanders of the fleet were then presented, as also the officer of the guard of honour, Captain Adir, R.M., of this ship. Before leaving the Sultan Walked alohg the maindeck, and, after having been on board about three quarters of an hour, left the ship, the same honours being paid to him, with the addition of the ships' dompaniee giving three sueb hearty cheers as His Maje4t probably never heard before. The cayque in which the Sultan came off was very handsome, painted white, the top inside and out being richly carved and gilded. In the bowvs as the figure of a white dove. This mjlrs the Sultan's caique.
We left the Bosphorns on the following evening. The squadron weighed together and steamed a short distance up the Bosphorus; then turning, camse down, passing the 'Palace quite clbse, all ships as they passed manning yards and rigging and dressing with flags, the Curacoa and ourselves firing a Royal salute. The Ambassador was on beard during the time, and on his leaving the ship off Seraglio Point was saluted with 19 gans. In the morning, before leaviug, Lord Lyons had a farewell audience of the Sultan, 'Who received him -without the slightest ceremony and with. out any one being present except the flag-lieutenant, a nephew of the Admira3, and the Turkish interpreter, Mr. 'Sarrell, one of the dragomas to the British Embassy.

SOUTHAMTON, AP= 9.
The European and Australian Company's steamship Juzn, Capt in E P. Moodie, arrived here this morning with the 'Australian mails received at Suez per Sinla, and thence conveyed overland to Alexandria. She left that port on the 28th ult., and Malta on the Ist of April.
The Jura brings 15 frst-clah and 14 second-class pas. 'sengers, and on freight 21 packages of specie, value 84,7171., one package of goid coin, value 1,1001., 630 bales of cotton, wool, &O., and 50 miscellaneous parcels.
On the 31st of March, in lat. 35° 35', long. 16', the Jnra spoke the bark Circassian, bound to the north-west; and pn tLe 7th of April. in lat. 44° 25', long. 8'42. the screw steamer Albania.
We received per Jura files of papers from Sydney to February the 10tb, and Melbourne the 14th, but they conten no news beyond that already publshed, received two 6r itee days since vi4 Marseilles.
The company's steamerEuropean--Captain Parfitt, arrived out at Melbourne on Febraary the 10th, in o8 daysefrom So,thampton, and sailed for Sydney on the following day.
After landing her mails, passengers, specie, and part of the cargo at Southampton, the Jura left this afternoon for Liverpool, to discharge the cotton and wool she has on board and take in Cargo for tho next out*ard voyage, this course being adopted on acoount of the heavy charges on the transit of goods levied by the South.Western Railway Company, whose true interesth would be servod by a reduction of their sates to a minumum scale, so as to indueo a larger i^cession of business to this port.
' The next outward mails for Australia, &., will be taken by the Etns, Captain hTilla, 'which leaves this on Sunday, ihe 12th inst..

French and English International Fat-Cattle Show.

PARIS, W rsDxz MonRIosa, APRIl 8.
Poissy, dtuiated on, tho Seine, about 17 miles' north-west of Paris by, the Rouea and Ha,r
Railway-a distanoe occupied by Tegetablaeardeu I vineyarda, open-field arabli, land, and the =oee1 of St. Gerniai-iiz the principal cattle-market for the city butchers, who purchrae there (it is said) anid slanghter chiefly in the Paris abattoirs some 2,0004-head of beasts and 15,000 sheep weekly.
With a view. of encouragiig the improve,ment of' live atosk in Fraune, and the production ,of animals of superior quality of flesh and earlymaturityin .growth and fattening,- he Government offered prizes to the amount of 30,000f., to be competed for by French and English fat stock at this market, and the show now beitg held will undoubtedly do much towards extending the knowvledge of good points in live beef and mutton among our agricultural allies across the ChanneL.
The "show -yard" consints simply of a number of booths or sheds erected inlthe usual cattle-market, these being of course highly decorated with tricolour flags and lImperial eagles, There is no enclosure by board fencing, there are no doors of adi onnto be passed the flit day by the few privileged to a "private view," and afterwards by the public on payment of a& fee, but, the juxies having cdmpleted their impection and made their 'awards, the show is to be open without charge, alike to breederi and graziers and Paris aiihtecrs.
The number of French cattle is 216; calves, 16 entries; sheep, 20; pigs, 65. The entries from Great Britai are of cattle 64, and sheep 24,
The shorthorns are rather a mall showr, there being but eight ; however, we have the names of the Duke ofBeaufort,Jord'Leigh, and Mr. Strtton as exhibitors. The Duke of Beaufort's ox, 35 months old, which takes the fi prize in Cllaa ,issa most superior animal, very levels and gf grt width, with a remarkably good chine and forequarter; flesh of beautiful quality, and well laid on in every part. He has been awarded the Pize of Honour, a silver cup value 2,500f., as the best ox in the show. Mr. Stratton's four years and two months Qid ox, which has received the first prize in the next class, is a very fine animal, very fat, and has some remarkably good
points.
The Devon clases are very good. The Earl of Leicester and Mr. Heath are theprincipal exhibitors. Mr. Heath's first prize steer in Clas IIL is a beautiful specimen of the breed; and Mr. Potter's, which obtains the prize in the next class, is certainly of great merit. The prize shorthorn of Mr. Stratton, that of the Duke of Beaufort, and bIr. Heath's prize Devon have been three times in competition with each other. At Birmingham the first, at Bakerstreet the latter, was thought worthy of the chief honolr; while at Poissy the judges have overruled the decision of the previous courts, and given to his Grace the mark of highest distinction.
Lord Hatherton, Mr. Heath, Mr Naylor and bMr. Powell show some fine Herefords Lord Hatherton's prize ox is well bred, handles well, and will make a better beast next year. Mr. Naylor's or, four years. and two months old, we noticed as very fat, and having great size and weight. Vhat motive could have induced an English breeder to disfigure an otherwise respectable class with guch a poor animal as one of the Herefords in Class V it is difficult to imagine; perhaps it is intended to show French farmers the difference existing between fattened and only half-fed beasts.
The Scotch cattle form the largest and one of the most meritorious divisions of the British contingent to the show. Among the polled breeds-Angus, Aberdeen, and GaUoway-are some excellent animals, but some eshibit the great defect of a high shoulder and sibking midway along the back. Mr. D'Crombie, Mr. Knowles Mr. Stewart, of Aberdeenshire, and Mr. Heath are3 exhibitors. One shown byMr. O'Crombie is very well made of good feeding quality. The first prize is awarded to an ox, four years and five months old, shown by the same gentleman; it -has very great size and depth of frame, level back, considerable breadth and capacity, but deficient as to quality of flesh.
The West Htighland classes are uncommonly good, and number no less than 14 entries. The Duke of Beaufort and Messrs. Gordon, Knowles, Wemyss, Martin, Johnstone, Low, Felton, and Sneyd are the principal exhibitors. Several of the dun and yellow cattle are much too plain to please a grazier's eye, and have too little flesh upon their ribs and hips to suit a butcher's hand; but some among them are very good meat, and have good curly coats. The Duke of Beaufort's first prize steer, four years and seven months old, is extraordinarily good, both in form and quality.
There is a large class of cross bred cattle. Mr. Druce shows a cross of Hereford and shorthorn; Air. Knowles, a shorthorn and poUed; and Mr. Stewart, Mr. Martin, Ar. Beveridge, Mr. GuUand, and others show crosses of shorthorn with various Scotch polled breeds. In some of the animals the improvement in form and general symmetry is very marked upon comparing them with the pure polled breeds. MIr. Martin's first prize beast is of great size, broad, fat, and wleU covered with firmandgood meat.
The British contribution of sheep is unfavourable to the credit of our agricultui aRd very fewfirstclass pens are to be seen. Mrs. West, of Bletchington, Oxfordshire, takes the first prize for her pen of five Cotswolds, which are also distinguished with the Prize of Honour, silver cup value 481,, as the most perfect inthe show. Our renowned Southdown, Leicester, and longtwool breeders do not appear in the field, and the strength of the show rests with the Cheviots, blackfaced, and crosses, Mr. Sandbach, of Denbighshire, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Stewart, of Scotland, and Mr. Druce, of Oxfordshire, beiRg chief exhibitors. We felt a great deal of loose mutton and found many defective animals, with comparatively few really good specimens calculated to show what the several breeds are capable of. The majority are onlyjust fair butcher's meat.
Of the native stock we only just say a word or two here, resorving a more extended notice for to-morrow. Instead of being classed according to different breeds, the cattle are arranged according to the locality from which they come, the empire having been apportioned into sit districts for the purpose. This readers it a somewhat difficulit task to compare the various breeds, and still more to estimate the comparative merits of each animal in a particular breed. However;, in an exhibition of fat stock the same facilities for examining into breed and fanily cannot be expected as at a show of really breedig stock, and it certainly appears the fairest way to let al compete together and award the prizes to the best animas for the butcher and the consumer, in which contest, of course, the breeds or crosses most generally valuable and profitable for the grazier and feeder ought to be found victorious. As it is, the handsome, compact, and kindly-feeding Charolais stands perhaps among a row of coarse, big-boned oxen, of immense size and frame it may be, but with scarcely any propensity for fattening at all, and in a condition stamping them in the judgment of the English farmer as ordinary 6' stores," inta of fattened cattle. Some very excellent beast may be observed scattered throughout the various classes, but it is precisely in the speCimens of French breeds crosed with English shorthorns that we find the level, square, and com-
pactform, the expanded cheat, outspringi3g rib
fne bone, flesh of a firm and beautiful quality, and
generally handsome appearance, which denote quick feeding properties, fine-grained and fat meat, small proliortion of bone, good constitution, and all those characteristias of an ox which is really " a grazier's without and a butcher's within." One of the most remarkable examples of what may be achieved by croming is the. prize steer in the 4"Deuxinme Region"--a cross between a shorthorn bull and Breton cow, and which at the veroy first cross has obtained a level bacl, a kindly ikin, superior flesh, and-many very gcod points.
Among the sheep the most noticeable are the extraoidinarily fine Merinos croised with Dishley Leicesters.
The show of pigs is very large, and this part of the exhibition reminds us more than any other of our own Baker-stret there being many very wellfed and superior animal.
It is not necessary to give the name ot all the .j, a but 'we must niot omit to mention that Mr4 WdlhainFarr for the cattle and Mr. Fisher Hobbs and MIr. Charles Stevenson for the sheep and pig

The repayments at the Bank to.dAy of advances made 'during the shutting were extriLordinarily large, and 4on the whole they aPPea to have beent eff6dted` ithout dificulty. Under the eici sbn6: the regular applications for discount wrer of courie heavy, but it is assumted that the balance of receipts mutt have been such as greatly to, strenugthenthe position of the establishment and to repair the zave'se features which will doubtless be exhibited in: the approaching Gazette return.
Foreign securities were heavy at the commencement of business, but there was subeequently a recovery in some instances to the extentof nearly a haif per cent. Turkish Six pet. Cents, for the account were negotiated at 964 and 97i, and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for money at 100j In Mexican there were no transactions, The general busines comprised-Chilian Six per Cents., 10i1 and 102i; New Granada Active, 23; Peruvian Four-and-a.-alf per Cents., 77X; Portuguese Three per Cents, 45; Spanish Three per Cents., 41; the Iew Deferred, for account, 24; Spanish Certificates) 6i; Dutch Two-and-a.Hal per Cents., 65 641, and 65 ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 964.
The trinsactions in the foreign exchanges, as is usual the day before Good Friday, were not very extensive. The rates for Hamburg and Amsterdam were again higher, but upon Paris bills were not to freely offered.
tA furher sum of 28,0ool. in Australian gold was taken to the Bank to-day.
The corn-market this moruing [continued to ex. hibit a downward tendency.
In the Liverpool cotton-market this week trausactions have been limited, and there has been no change in prices.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 20c. for money, and 69f. 50c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of about i per cent
In the produce-markets during the , owinf to the increased value of money, there has beea a diminution of activity, and prices of some of the principal staples exhibit a shght reduction. The new scale of sugar duties came into operation on Monday, and the public sales on the foUowing day were rather large, but a fair proportion was taken at irregular quotations. The differential rates upon good to fine grocery kinds went chiefly to importers those upon low and brown being participated in by the trade. To-day the market rather unexpectedly assumed a dull appearance, closing 6d. lower in many cases, particularly for common kinds. Importers, however, bought in freely, including several parcels of foreign at fuly previous rates. Not more than four or five floating cargoes have been sold, and only one of Havannah for exportation. Of coffee a limited quantity has been submitted, and to-day plantation Ceylon found buyers at extreme rates. Nothing of interest has occurred in native growth or floating cargoes. The market has closed -ith steadiness. In rice the transactions have been unimportant, and quotations have receded about 3d. per cwt. No change of importance has taken place in spice, the market remaining firm. Saltpetre is still extremely dull, and quotations may be considered almost nominal. At the public sales to-day no offers approaching the previous value were made. Rum maintains the improvement recently established. In the tea-market the operations have been upon a very limited scale. Small public sales have taken place, at which some green went at easier rates, and some common congou out of condition realized about is. per lb. The trade have been entirely occupied in clearances under the new duty.
The total amount of duty paid on tea on Monday, the 6th inst., throughout the united kingdom was 626,2301., representing 8,840,8971b. weight. The number of entries pased at the London Customhouse for tea alone on that day was 24,635, the duty on which was 324,1221.
At a speca meeting of the Imperial Brazilian Mning Association held to-day it was agreed to carry out a dissolution. A diversity of opinion prevailed with respect to the immediate necessity of adopting this course, but it was ultimately arranged that the resolution should be passed, the prospective outlay being large and uncertain. If favourable intelligence should be received before the next meeting for confirming this act an adjournment may be ordered and other measures devised. The Cumba vein and DualVs shoot are the points which appear to be most favourable, but the latest advices are not encouraging. ~One of the directorsprotested against the dissolution, asserting that the property could by further expenditure be made remunerative, hut his opinion was not supported by the other members of the board.
The Nimroud has arrived from Sydney, but her amount of gold remains to be ascertained. The Ellenborough is advised as having sailed from Sydney with 30,000 sovereigns.
The Abdul MIedjid has arrived from Shanghai with 499,4001b. of tea and 195 bales of silk.

A fair demand continues for most kinds of yarn and cloth. Medium qualities of T-clot.hs, from 61b. weight upwards, have been taken in large quantities during the week, and stocks have been well cleared. There is also more inquiry for longoloths and low printers. There is a fair business in India shirtings and other fabrics, but less than might have been expected. Inmost of these goods prices are very firm. In yarns there is quite sufficient busine, to
ep prices steady, aud spinners are mostly free from stock, itt prices rather in favour of the seller.

The lace trade is more active, more particularly for goods connectedwiththe home trade. Business, however is by no means as brisk as it was anticipated it would be, the season being a very late one. After Easter the demand will, no doubt, improve, and, as all departments are in a healthy atate, a good trade is expected. The demau&n for plain goods contmnues, and there is more doing in fancy laces. Silk and cotton are still exceedingly dear.
In hosiery the trade is in a dourishing state, and there are prospects of continued briskness.

GREAT WESTFRN OIF nANAtnA-
The balf-yearly meeting>of this company was held yester. day at the London Tavern- )Pr. R. Gill, the presiadnt, in the chair.
The secretary read the minxtes of the last meeting which, wQre conf'rmed. The report, an abstract of which has appeared inThe Times, was taken as read.
The capital account to the 31st of January showed that 5,035,228t. carrency had been received, and 5,115,0821. expended, less 62,1461. Galt and Guelph RaiIway bonds received, leaving a balance against the company of 17,7081. 'he capital account showed an unauthorized payment to Sir Alan ld'Nab of 6,0001., being a second payment to him of that amount. The revenue account for the half-year ending the 31st of January last showed that 393,8801. currency had been received, and 200,1161. expended, leaving a balance of 193,7641. currency in favour of revenue. To this sumn was added 8,0551. from the last account, making 201,8191. currency. From this was deducted 52,9221. interest on bonds, 14,0831. for sinking fund to provide for the half-yearly liquidation of the Governnwent loan, leaving 134,813. for general dividend, which, al; the rato of 9 per cent. per annum, amounted to 130,2381., leaving 4,5761. for the next account.
The CHAMBLA?N, inx movng the adoption of the report, said it was so fluU that it did not require any explanation fzom him, but if it was the wish of any proprietor to have further explanation he would be happy to give it, There were, however, one or two facts in reference to the construction of railways in Canada to Which he wished to call their attention. The estimated cost of their line in Canada was 5,0001. currency, or 4,0001. sterling per mile; but the cost up to the 31st of January last had been three times that amount. The English board of directors had only been lately appointed, and it orginated with a committee of inquiry. When they were first elected directors they had no vote at the Canadian board, they had recourse to proxies as a means of controUing the expenditure, and eventually succeeded in the session before last in obtaining power to be represented at the Canadian.boardL They found that 283 miles of railway, exclusive of rolling stock, had cost them at the rate of 15,0ChO per mile for a single line of railway from the suspension bridge over the NiXgara falls to Windsor, opposite Detroit. It was proposed to have a double line, and other heavy expenses at stations, to provide for the expected traffic. Be bad told them that he would vote for confining the expenditure to a single line; and in that he was supported by the shareholders; the result was that they were now about- to receive a dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum. Had they allowed themselves to make everything complete as proposed by their Canadian friends, they would not hbve ha, two dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, three halfyearly dividends at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, and one at 9 per cent. per annum. He bad no doubt that the traffic on the line was equal to all their anticipations. It was insisted that they should have a double line to accommodate the traffic; but he said he would wait for the traffic to double before he would consent to lay down the second line. They had carried the double traffic on the single line amounting to 20,0001. a-week, instead of 10,0001. a-week, as originally estimated for a single line. Their traffic averaged about 15,0001. a-week, the maimsum being about 20,000h, a-week, thus clearly proving the capability of the single line to convey a much larger amount of traffic than was estimated. He was confident, however, they vwould have to do something more for the augmentatiori of traffic. He had looked over various matters, and it appeared to him they would eventually have to spend 50 per cent. more capital; but he would not ask them to spend more until they were certain of maintaining at least 9per cent. dividend. If they could not' maintaini their dividend with the increasedoutlay, he, for one,wouldnot aesanttothe expenditure. The country had a right to expest a certain amount of accommodation, but it should not be afforded at the expense of their dividend. There were some shareholders who thought that the dividends should be equalized as much as possible- but he differed from them on that point, for a shareholder might hold shares in a railway in the beginning of a month and ciroumstances unight occur that would compel him to sell his shares before the end of the month. Others, for the excitement of a change, would sell the stock of one company and buy into another. He maintained that whatever profit was earned in any halfyear the shareholders were entitled to their share of it, provided it were honestly earned. The Brighton, the South. Eastern, the South-Western, and other railway companies, divided what they made in the half-year, and he thought that was the fair way, and it would be unust to existing shareholders to withhold the dividend the
uad earned. He then advertod to the great increase which had taken place in the traffic on the line, and pointed out the vast amount of traffic that might be expected fronm the extension of various lines of railway communication radlating from their terminus at Detroit. He had been told they would never be able to carry the traffic that would be sent for conveyance over their line, but he had no fear of that. They never had had their trafiic stopped until the appalling accident that had recently occurred on their line. It was satisfactory to know that no blame could be attributed to any one - it was an accident which they could not controi, and that no human foresight could have prevented. It was caused by the breahdng of the fore axle of the enie whenwithin 150 yards of the bridge. The ngine gotoffthe line and fel upon the bridge with its enormous weight of 25 tons, and it carried away a portion of the bridge, and the lamentable result was too well known. With regard to competinglines in Canada, he thought English shareholders should bAr. in mind the enormous amount of working expenses. He had looked into a document respecting the receipts and workin expenses of railways in the United Kingdom, issued by teg Board of Trade, and he found the cost of working the Great Western of Canada RaUlway per mile was more than the receipts of many good lines in England. It was at the rate of 6s. currency, or 5s. sterling, per train mile. The gross receipts of railwas in England averaged 5s, 8d. per train mile, being only od. per mifle more than the cost of working in Canada. He thought people in England should pause before they subscribed their money for the construction of rival lines in Canada. The receipts per train mile on their line in Canada was lIs.; on the London and North-Western the receipts per train mile averaged 7s. 7iLd; the Lancashire and Yorkshire, 6s, 5id. ; the Great Northern, 4s. 7id.; the two latter lines being the se length as the Great Westem of Canada; the Midland received 6s. Ld. per train nile, and the North Eastern 4s. 3d. The Great Western of Canada had cost them three times the amount they were led to believe it could be made for- he believed there was no such thing as a cheap railway. WWt
regard to the further expenditure of funds in Canada he would advise them not to make the double track until their dividends amounted to 10 or 12 per cent. per annum. The ordinary rate of interest in Canada was 10 or 12 per cent., and he could tell them that it a Canadian borrowed money at 10 or 12 per cent, he must get 20 per cent. The Canadians hardly held a share in the company, because they could do much better with their money ; about 1,200 shaxres were held in Canada. There were some gentlemen in the room who held as many. Let them get better dividends before they parted with any snore capital. He beged them never to believe in the possibility of a cheap railway. They had paid as much per aore for land in Hamilton as they would have to pay in Manchester; for land in Canada they had paid fabulous prices. He therefore hoped they would not be deceived by cheap railways in Canada. Be concluded by moving the adoption of the report and a dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum, payable on the 6th Miay,
Mr. Hoyxs seconded the motion. HIe stronely objected to the item of 5,0001. paid to Sir Alan M'Nab without authority, and he hoped the matter would be inquired into. He did not know what sort of accountants they had at the other side of the water to allow such an item to pass. They were indebted to Mr. Brydges, their managing director, for his moral courage in opposing the transaction.
Mr. S. HERAPATH thought, on the whole, their traffic accounts were satisfactory; their receipts per train mile had increased, while the cost of working had dimainished. With regard to the chairman's comparison of the receipts on their line with those on the English lines, he (Mr. Herapath) thought the difference arose from the Great Western of Canrda being nearly all trunk, while the London and North. Western consisted to a great extent of branch hnes, There could be no doubt that the trunk line of the London and North-Western earned more than lUs. per train mile, although the average did not exceed 7s. 7d. per mile * it was therefore not a fair comparison. He would enter his protest against enlarging their capital for branch lines.
The CHAIBRr said they did not intend to make a single branch lne, but to double their existing line, and provide for an enlarged traic when necessary. He fully coincided in the objection against branch lines. They had only the tSarnia branch, which might be considered as part of the
Mr. S. HERAPAT hoped that the pledge their chairman had given with respect to branch lines would be adhered to by his successors, if they should have the misfortune to lose him. With regard to the 5,0001. given to Sir A. M'Nab he believed it originally formed part of an item of 20,0001. into which it was smuggled. It was the act of the former Canadian board, and the present board had very properly brought it forward. As a shareholder it gave him great satisfaction to see the receipts increase and the expenses diminish. (Cheers.)
Mr. WEBB thought it was not advisable to pay a larger dividend than they did before. The result of the Sarnia branch would be to reduce their dividend, It would cost 600,0001, and would certainly not yield 9 peir cent,

required further accommodation they should pay for it. They could not be wrong in paying the present dividend, He thought the branches would have the effect of increasing the revenue on the main line.
Mr. BYLAITEWAITE thought the Chairman should have stated whether the estimated capital for the Sarnia and Gait branches would be sufficient.
Mr. Cox objected to the 9 per cent. dividend, because they had lost a certain amount on the steamboats, which he thought should have been charged to revenue. At all events they ought not to increase their dividend, under the circumstances.
Mr. S. Hx1RArATHI differed from his friend on the question of dividend - that which had been honestly and fairly earned in the haif-year belonged to the shareholders, and ought to be divided among them. It was very impolitic to leave a large balance in the hands of the directors, as it induced extravagance. Let everything be fully and fairly charged up to revenue, and divide the balance. it was true they had brought 8,000& into the half-year's aoconnt, and only carried over 4,0001., but then it should be recollected that they had charged revenue with a sum of 14,0001. to go towards reducing the Government loan, so he thought they could safely divide 9 per cent. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Hovyxs fully concurred in the observations by Hr. Herapath with resect to the dividend.
After some further observations from Mr. LECHWO:Tg, Mr. RooERs, and Mr. BRArTwAIrn,
The CHAnuuN replied to the various questions. He stated that it was not intended to lay out the additional capital on branch line3. Tlhe dividend had been honestly earned, and ought to be divided asjpreposed. It would be very unfair to charge revenue with the loss of the steamboats, because it now paid interest on their cost (93,000) at the rate of 9 per cent, per annunm, and would continue to do so. They were prepared to scuttle the boats rather than
keep them at asiexPInSe of 10M0001. or 12,0001. per annum, 'bht they had sold t em for ihares in the Detroit and 3Mi
waukee Railway, entitled to div,dends of 7 per cent. The revekiue had already been over-chazged with Interest On unproductive works. The Sarnia branch piased throu,g'a rorest, and they were not in hute to compiete- it until other lines were made. They were in hopes of raising roney on bonds at 5 per cent. to pay off the Government loan. The transfer department was found perfectly correct, and had adopted precautionary nmea9ures from the coxmmeSicement
while other companies had only recently adopted ffiem.
Resolutions wrere passed unanimoulsly adopting the report aud declarig the dmdenat the rate of 9 per ceat. per annum.
On the motion of Mr. fIOYES, seconded by Mr. S. fhCAPATH, a resolution was unanimously passed requestihi the directors to take such steps with reference to the 5600. given without authority to Sit A. M'Nab PA mightlbe'eipe. dient,. and to withhold their confidence from those who had sanctioned that payment.
Mr. HoYES trusted that there muneration to theii steadfast friend, Mr. Bridges, swould be increased from 1,-o00.' to -2,0001 a-year. (Hear, hear.) - - ;

*William Webb, alics Philip Cohen, atia Philip lNeavy, 19, a slim youngzman, dewribed in thecalendar as a butcher, wac indicted for the capital offence of cutting and wounding AUfred Buckler,with intent to murder him.
The indictment contained theuscminor counts chargig the intent of the prisoner to be thAt of doing grievous bodily harm.
Mr. Payne conducted the prooesctiori the prisoner wa defended by Mr. Sieigb.
The learned counsel for the prosecution on opening the case said that thecharge agibnst the prisoner ws one of a very extraordinary and aggravated character. There could be no doubt that the prisoner had made a mosttavage aittck upon the prosecutor while they were trave'ling together in a railway carriage, and it appeared to him that the only question that in the result tho jury would have to'dispose of was whether when the prisoner made the attack upon the prosecutor he did so with intent to murder him in which cae it would be their duty to findhim guilty upo the count in the indictment chring a cApital offence or
wnietner they couIdf nander the ceirumtances, feel them. selves justifiea in convicting him only of the minor offence of wounding with intent to dogrievousbodilyharm.
3r. Alfred Buekler, the prosecutor, who, it appeared, Is a linendraper's assstant, was then examined, -Ed eaid,-On the evening of the 5th of March I got into one of thecarriges upn the North London Iailway, at the Poplar sttion, intendig to froceed to the Hm7*tead.rod4 station, near whieh place i going to visit a friend& The prisoner was in the carniage, and al soome other pas. sengers, bat at the Camdenwroad station they all got out except che prisoner, and I was left alone in the,carriage with him. When we had gone a short distanoe he asked ne the name of the nett station, and r told him it the Hampgtead-road, and he then said, " It is about half-pat 8,' isit not?I I pulled out my watch and told him it was 25 minutes past 8, and I then put my watch in my pocket and turned to the window, and. was looking out, wben I felt a violent blow on my neck. I turned round, and then received another blow in the side, and, upon looking at the prisoner, I sawv that he had a knife in s and when I seized the knife by the blade, andalso eized hold of the prisoner, and we struggled together, and while we were srrggling the prisoner tried to pull the kmife out of my hand. I felt my hand eut deeper as he tried to draw the knife through it. I contnued strggling-with him, and squeezed him by the throat, and he then tried to get away from me.i At this time the train was going slower, and at length it stopped at the station, and the carriage door was opened' inimediately,when I said to the guard or porter, "Take this man; he has stabbed me." The moment the door of the carriag s openedthe ptisoner droppedthe knife andsaid, "The s &fe is not mine- this ;entleman tried to stab me and in self-defenoe I stabbed him." I had nothing to do with the knie, and I made no attack whatever upon the prisoner. (The knife was produoed. It Was a very dn-: gerous weapon, and such as is generally used for pigkiling.) I was attended by a surgeon at the railway sta-' tion, and have been under the care of a surgeon up to this time. The moment the earriage stopped I found that I had been wounded in the neck.
rroes-examined.-Ileftmyownhouseatpoplarat2Ominutes to 8 o'clock, and got into thetrai at a quarter to 8 o'clock. I had had nothing to drink exceRt my tea during the evening. I was in asecond.class carrnage, and the different compariments opened into each other, There were no other persons in any of the compartments. The first question the prisoner put to me wvas to know the name of the next station. No quarrel or dpute of any kind took place between
By the JuIDGE.-The train did not stop for more than two minutes after the prisoner first commenced the attack upon me,
WiDiam Sandford, porter at the Hampgtead-road station, deposed that he was on duty on the evening of the 5th of March, and as the train passed him he heard cries of "Murder !" and "Help I" He made his way to the carriage whence the sounds issued as soon as he could, and upon opening the door the prisoner and the prosecutor appeared as though they had been struggling. The prosecutor exclaimed, "For CGod's sake, porter, take this man; he has been trying to stab me 1" When he said this the prisoner dropped the knife, and I saw it was bloody. The prisoner was secured, and the prosecutor, who appeared to be almost fainting, was led away by the stationmaster. The prisoner said when I laid hold of him that the knife did not belong to him, it belonged to the gentleman, who had tried to stab him, but he took it from him and stabbed him instead. The prosecutor when he heard the prisoner say this replied that it was false.
James Webb, a police sergeant of the S division, deposed that he was on uty at the police station in Albanystreet, and he remembered. tho prisoner being brought there on the night in question, about a qurter to 9 o'clock. He said his name was William Webb, but he refused to give his Address, because he said he did not want his parents to know that he was in trouble. He said that he was sailor, and he added that the gentleman had tried to stab him first. He took the prisoner to the railway station, and he there repeated tat the prosecutor had stabbed him, and the prosecutor said that it was false. There was a good dead of blood on the prisoner's face and hands, but there were no wounds on him except a slight one on one of his fingers, and a ecratch upon his tumb. Witness told the prisoner that these wounds had not made the blood that was on his person, and he made no reply. He searched him, and found only one halfpenny in money, and he had no railway ticket.
Mr. Holford, a surgeon, at Haverstock-hill, deposed that he was called in to attend the prosecutor about 9 o'clock. He was sitting onachair, and appeared quite faint, and his clothes wlere bloody. Upon tahng off his neckerchief he found one very dangerous wound on the left side of his neckl about an inch long and an inch deep, and it was within an inch of the carotid artery. It was a punctured wound, such as might be caused by a knife li-e the one produced, and it had been occasioned by a stab and not by a cut. There was another wound on the left arm an inch long and two inches deep, and there was also a bruise on the right side of the neck, and some scratches on the forehead and chin. The prosecutor's right hand was also cut.
In answer to a question put by the learned JuDGri, the witness sad that a good deal of violence must have been used to cause the wound in the neck and the arm with such a weapon as the knife that had been produced.
The prosecutor was recalled, and he tated that at the time he was attacked he had two coats on and a silk scarf tied four times round his neck. He was stabbed in the neck completely through aU these thicknesses. His coat was also stabbed through in four other places, but the thicknesg prevented the weapon from reaching his body.
Mr. David Myers, a butcher in Whitechapel, deposed that the prisoner was formerly in his service. His real name was David Neavy. He was only employed by him to carry out meat, and not as a slaughterman.
By Mr. SLIGIL-The prisoner was a well-behaved young man while he was in his service. He left him about seven months before this occurrence took place. He had not heard that he was addicted to habits of intemperance,
Mr. SLEIG1{, at the close of the case for the prosecution, addressed thejury on behalf of the prisoner, and saidhe really hardly knew what topic he could urge on behalf ofhisclient after the evidence that had been adduced. It would be idle to attempt to deny that a most savage attack had been made upon the prosecutor, but he hoped that the jury, takingintoconsideration the extraordinary circumstances of the case and the youth of the prisoner, woald feel that they might conscientiously fmd him guilty upon the minor count of the indictment, and thus avoid the chance of consigning the wretched young man at the bar to the caffold.
Mr. Justioe WILLIAMS, in snmming up, said there did not appear to be any dispute as to the facts, and the only question for the jury to consider was whether the prisoner really intended to murder the prosecutor, intending to rob him whenhe had thus reduced him to silenoe; or whether he wag atuated by a lesser intent when he committed the assult upon him.
The jury, after a short deliberation, found thG prisoner Guily of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
The learned JUDOz, in passing sentence upon the prisoner, said the jury had very mercifully acquitted him of the offence of wounding with intent to murder the prosecutor, but had found. hi guilty of doingso with intent to do griovous bodily harm ; and in the whole ctourse of his experience it was one of the worst eases of
that elas that he hadever met with. A savage attack such as was made by the prisoner upon the promeutor-to doubt with the intentfo to plunder bim-was an offence so heinous, and so weU calcuated to cause the greatest oble alarm to the publioe,that he felt he should be negleri his duty if he dld nrt pass the most severe entnce nxd by tho law for such an offence, which ,:ihal he be tr ported beyond theoas for the term of his natural lif. Mr. PAxS then asked his Lordship to xercise the
*he possessed of ordering the proseutoarerdfrppe hending the urisoner.
Mr. Justicc Wn Ars said he should have been ready to
do so, but he did not think the!Act of Parliament applied to such a cree s this,ant& herefors- he had no power to make such an order. . I ..

The facti of this ee have appeared within the Ilst few 'days in the polce reports.

The prisoner, a 'ashionablv-dressed military-looking man, is said to be of a highly respectable family in SuffoDk
The facts of thecase ly in a very narrow compss. The prisoner had been tang for some short time at the Queen!s Hote St. Martia's-le-Grand, where, upon the 17th of Xarch, his ill, including some money he had borrowed of Mr. Sherman, the manaecr of the hotel, amounted to 101. lOs, lid., for which he drew the check in question as Captain Lurie, upcon the bank of Memssrs Oakes sd Fineham, of Diss, Norfolk. This check was paid in throh other bnkers, and therefore the fraud was not immed
ately found out. Upon the 20th he requested to have the difference betwreen lia bill and a *hecl for 3L, and hls urgent manner causig some suspicion he was told he could not be accomnodaMed until they knew whether the first check had been honoured.

(Beform the Co3moN-SzRJzANT.)
Hendrick Stenniwood, 30, labourer, and John Buckner, 40, musician, two very respectable-looking Germans were indicted for endeavouring to utter counterfeit halfcrowns.
Mx. W. Cooperprosecuted, and Mr. Campbell Sleigh wa for the defence.
The case, from the nature of the defenoe, was of a moet peculiar character, and occupied the Court a conSderable time.
It appeared that about half-past 12 o'clock upon the 21Wt of Mairch both the prisoners went to the steamboat staion at Chelsea, and tendered in payment of the fue a halferown, which was at once detected as a bad one, and Bristow, the moneytker, cut it into two pieces, asking Stenniwood, who tendered it, whether he had any more of the same sort, as, if he bad, he would get into trouble about them. They then went away, and Buckner took the broken pieces. About two hours after this both prisoners went to the shop of a grooer in Ber ickstreet, where Stenniwood asked for some sugar. In payment be tendered another bhd halferown, which he was tolM was bad and was asked for another. Stenniwood then turned to Buckner for another, and he took from his pocket another, which he gave to the other prisoner, who tendered itto the shopman. This also was bad, nd George Goldby, the shopmanwho was servingthem,attraced theattentioni of the other shopman, and they intimated to the prisoners that they should not let them go, and asked if theyhadanymore; upon which the prisoner Buckner pulled out three mere,
and the broken pieces which had been given back to them at the steamboat station. A constable was then called in, aud Buckner, in answer to the officer's questions, sid that he had taken them at a beershoop in Edward-street, which, upon inquiry, it turned out that he kept, and had recently taken outhe other prisoner. Upon being searched a gooc balfcrown was found on Buckner. Buckner said he had taken themn in change for a sovereign, but upon the officer questioning Buckner's wife she said they had all been taken over the counter, wherethey hadobeen sent by an oldman in payment for beer.
Mr. Webster, the Inspector of Coins to the Mt, said that all five were from the same mould, and were very good imitations.
Mr. SLEIGH, for the defence, said he should clearly show that his clients had no knowledge of the coin being bad, and that the circumstances under which it came into their possession were the most remarkable ever brought before a court of justice. The learned counsel then in a most able speech dwelt upon the facts, nd, from his statement and the ituosses he caled, it appeared that upon the evening previous to tho png the money-the whole of the five halfcrowns had been sed off upon Buckner in the following manner :-A old man wearing a red cap had upon five separate occasions waited outside of the prisoner Bucknor's ocershop, and sent in a boy for beer with onedot the halferowus, which had been taken in each instance without suspicion.^
The learned CoUNSEL then called a boy named John Russell, who corroborated the statement, and, although searchingly cross-examined by Mr. COOPB, adhered to the statement he first made.
Mxr. CoopER, in reply, candidly admitted he thought the boy spoke the truth, but that did not remove the doubt as to the prisoner's subsequent mnowledge that the coin was bad.
Albove 20 witnesses spoke to their good chactor.
The CoasaoN-SEarBJ -T, in summing up, remarked non the extraordinary nature of the case, and told the jury Enat the question for them was what the leArned counsel in his reply had so ably put to them.

MAIo ssN-HoUsE.-ohn Berry, who has been remanded i 'upon the chargeof having robbed his employers, Messr. FslarLsnd and aitoomb, Manchster warehousemen, of Stai-. tourt, Bread-street, of a piece of silesia of the value of 20s., was brought before the LORD MAYOR and Nr. Alderman nAGL=XON, In petty sessions, for final examination.
The LoRD AYoi inquined whether, in the event of a light punishment being inflicted, the prosecutors would again take the prisoner into their service ?
Mr. Wbitcomb sRid, they woud undertake to do so.
The LoRD MAYOR said, it was tieopinion of his brother sangistrate and himself tiat the prisoner had borne an irretrcechable character up to the present time, bat that he had
een tempted to act dishonestMy on account of want of monoy for domestic purposes. Had the prosecutors not confeuted to receive tho prisoRcr again into their service it would have been the duty of the Court to inflict a severe cunishment, lnder all the circumstances of the case, the uosrt thought the e4ds of jistice would be answered by sentencing the accused to a day's imprisonment, after which he would return to his masteos employment.
MAnRLBOROuHi-oS -Margaret Watson and Catbeine 1'Cormick, mother and daughter, were brought before hr. BLTGHsw for re-examination, charged with stealing a quantity of table linen, sheets, &c., from the residences of the Earl of Shaftesb4ry and Viscount Palmerston, whero they had beon occasioaily employed in charing.
Aftersomeadditionsl evidence the prisonerswerecom* united for trial
Peter Wallace, aged 66, Lieutenant-General of Artillery. residing at No. 3, Crescent-place, Milbank, was charged with indecently exposing his person.
Miss Susanna Clark, of 102, Oxford-streot, ladies' readymade linon warehohse,said-The prisoner came into the shop to-lay, and askod to look at a lady's chemise. I turned to take down a parcel, and when I got the right parcel I turned round, and distinctly saw that he was exposing biniself.
Mr. BLNGic,ui.-I am obliged to ask you to speak plainly. Did you see his naked person ?
Witness.-I did. I heard the prisoner previously say "Don't you know me? I've been here before," for the purpose, as i believe, of attracting my attention to what he was doing. I immediately ran to the other end of the shop and upoke to my brother-in-law, and asked him to turn out the rman, telling him at the samne time what I had witnessed. The prisoner did not speak when he made the exposure.
Mr. BI2NGILsi.-Didyou give him in charge?
Witness.-My brother-in-law asked me if Iwas quite sure about wvhat I complained of ? I said I was, and my brotherin-law replied he would give him in charge.
Edwin Busby, brother-m-law of the witness,said,-As soon as I was informed of what the prisoner had done I went to him and asked him what he meant by what he had been doing. He said, " I have not done anything," and I then gave him into custody.
Police-constable Steevens, E n, said,-I took charge of the pnsoner. He said he was not guilty.
Mr. BISG HA3 (to the prisoner).-I am ready to hear anything you have to say.
Prisoner.-I went into the shop in Oxford-street, where I had been accustomed to buy things for my wife, who is now dead. I asked for a lady's chemise, and the witness pulled down some parcels, but did not appear to have what I wanted. There were five or six young women inthe room. Suddenly the witness ran round the counter; she was on one side and I on the other, and at first I thought she was in a fit. Hlowever she could imagine anything I cannot say. Except that I put my hand into my pocket to pull out my purse, I know of nothing that could be mistaken for such an act asthat described. There were five orsix youngwomennear the counter and about the shop at the time. This is one of those charges that it is imossible for any man to face except by telling all he can recollect.
Mr. BlINGIRAM recaUed Miss Clark, and said,-You have heard what has just been said. Are you quite sure you have made no mistake? Do you repeat your statement -notwithstanding the denial you have just heard?
Miss Clark.-I do.
Mr. BlNGI1Aar.-It Is may duty to send this case to the Quarter Sessions in order that the opinion of a jury may be taken on the conflicting statements of the accused and his accuser. I shall call upon the accused to find high bail for his appearance,-two sureties in 1001. each, and himself
in2001.
MARYEIt ONE -James Wiliams, a man about 35 years of age, was charged under the following circumstances.
ft appesred from the evidence that on the previous afternoonthe prisoner went to the shop of Mr. teyzer, 46 a, Edgeware-road, and offered for sale a silver spoon and fork, both of which had been bent double. Upon being questionedastohowthe articles came into his possession he saidthathe had bought them hor . of the butler at8, ,wnsington-mardems-terracet Suspecting that they had been stolen btr. lyzer detained the prisoner until the arrival of police-constable lIolloway, 268D. Upon inquiry being lnstituted it was ascertained that the prous belonged to
er. Wv EH Weatherby, whose address the prisoner had correotly given to plr. geyzer, and that on the day of the robbery fo had ealled at the house to see the butler, to whom he had for many months been known.
The butler said that it was not the wish of his master to prosecute; but
Mr. Loso stated that it was a most serious offence, and deserved severe punishment.
The prisoner, who pleaded gul,ty and said he was very sorry for what he had done, was sent to hard labour in tho House of Correction for six calendar months.
WoriSnlP-SmlEs-r.-Jokn Clarke, a middle-aged well-. dressed man, having much the appearance of arcspectable tradesman, was charged with the follosing robbory.
Henry Young, a tall, sunburnt, ad po erful sailor, said, -kestorday afternoon I was passing through WeUcloses.uare, when I was met by this gentleman (the prisoner) who began talking to me, and said he had a son abroad ni Australa, who had written to him a lettor desiring him to sentd him overasee stuff to make tents of, and then the gentleman asked m whaet was the best kind of stuff to send, as he had no idea himself, and ho thought that I must knowe, I having just come home from sea by my looks. I told him what I thought ho wanted, for which he was obliged, and took me to a publichouse, where we had something to drink, and then we went in a cab to another publichouse, about two or three miles off. There WaS a skittleground at the backr
and we went into it,-I think I should know that agaiu if I saw it,-and the gentleman began playing at skittles with another gentleman, and, as he got the worst, ho asked me to lend him a trifle to pay what he had lost. I said " Yes," and lent him three sovereiNas at firs', and then five sovereigns, and after that he aseed mo to lond him a 10C.-note I *had pulled out, that he might get change and keep about 41. out of that. Hre said, "You've got money, anud can afford to lend it; I have unfortunately lost, hut I will be sure to return it to you." I said, "'Well, I'll go wvith: you, then ;" but be said, " No, you stop back ;" hut I said, "Mind, -you're not to go, unless I go with you ," but immediately after that he went out without me. I was following him, when three men tried to stoep me, but I tripped them up, one after the other, and followed the gentleman, who all the time had a companion with him, who he said was his nephew.
By Mr. D'ENz-or-n'r.-I had had some groi certainly, but was not stnpid, and am sure I didn't bet.eI was paid off yestorday from the Star of Tasmania, from Van Diemen's Land, and had 171. or 181. when I went into the house, but 'when I came out I had got only about 14s. I had one glass with this gentleman at the first publichouse and felt a little stupid aftor that; it made me feel heady like, but I did not feel anything the matter with my stomach. I tbink I also gave him some silver with the 31., and ran after him to a 'barber's shop not far off. I took him to be a honest, upright man like myself, or I shouldn't have lent him the money. The note produced is mine. He took the note out of my hand and never returned it to me, though I asked him for it several times. I gave the gentleman into custody before this, but the man said, " I don't know anything about you or Tour note," and he wouldn't take him.
Mr. John Reed, landlord of a publichouse in Slater-street, Spitalfields, but not that where the prosecutor was robbed, said-The prosecutor and prisoner camc to my house for some ale, but 1 refused to serve them, as they had both been drinking and were quarrelling about a note, the sailor saying he wvanted his money back. I suspected something wrong on the part of the prisoner, and therefore sent for a constable.
Sergeant HIunt, 19 H.-I was on duty in Brick-lane,when I saw a large croNvd, and the prisoner ran into a barber's shop and the prosecutor after hirn. I followed with the snob, and the prosecutor said, " That man has a 101.-note of mine." Prisoner said, "I have not-you search me." I did so, but only found Is. Gd. and a knife. Prosecutorsaid he would charge him, but offered, if prisoner would give him 51. out of the note he would say no more about it. " Well," said the prisoner, "you must be a siUly man ;" but I took himn to the station, and, being t ere told by Scrgeant Armstrong that the p-i. soner had something in his moutb, I seized him by the throat, and the consequence was that he spat out the 101.- note produced.
Prnsoner.-It is my own note, Sir. I bad it from a persoa who hawks clothes at Greenwicb threo weeks ago, and more.
Mr. D'E vcOmtRT-There is no moral doubt whatever as to yoour guilt, but I do not think that the unsupported testi-
mnony of tae prosecutor would warrant me in sending yoa bef',re a jury. I shall therefore suimmarily convict you of unlawful possession of the property, for which you will go for two months' hard labour to the House of Correction, an(l the note will be restored to its owvner.
The note war soamewhat dilapidated, but the sailor was very glad to get back his property.
We have received a letter from Mr. R. W. Cohen, a gentleman residing at Shacklewell, and who was charged at this court, as detailed in our imlpression of yesterday, with inciting a number of persons to ass.:alt and resist the polico in the execution of their duty. This letter has been referred to the reporter, who expresses his inability to discover any cause of complaint against the professedly abridged staterment giveit by him. thouigh certainly an abundance of grievance, if the writer's account be true, against the police. Mr. Cohen expressly reserved his defence, and the reporter could therefore give none for him, but he wishes it to be stated that, as he could nmake none in court, the grounds of his interference will be g'ated when before the jury, and he says that he has abundance of evidence to prove that the language imputed to hinm by almost every witness in succession is utterly false. Be states that he saw a constable strike the woman Ballard in a most brutal manner twice across the arm, and that in endeavourir'g to protect her from such violence he himself got implicated. He denies that the woman retaliated, but one of the witnesses positively swore to heing struck by lher twice or three tinmes on the neck, and with tho truth or falsehood of that the reporter has nothing to do. The unanimity of the polico evidence against him he attributes to their being allowed to be in court,
though this is not strictly true as a2lecting the whole of the constables, but the conclusion of his letter, if correct, det'li 'aain)ustiee Nhich ought to be given, le states that he told the cormatable who struck the wonan he was Rot justified in
using his staff, and that he shomild report him; that lie went
to the station to do so; that cni reaching there he was| touched an the arm by an ofi-cer, who told him he in!iat consider himself in cuastody ; tb Lt hi) aas then chargedi withl inciting the mob, ifr the purpose of reversiLg hiis position
by making him a d6fendaut; that he was looked up for three hours, assaultdd, grossly insulted, and refused pens ad er to acquiint his anxious family with the posatiox
splaced; and, finaly, that they would not, for two hours, a.nd a-half, even allowhim to send for bail. Tbtue are the complaints the gentleman now makes against the police, and had they all come out in court they would
ll nave been given, instead of being postponed to the
SOUTRWAlRt-.Jamea Brown, a tall man, dressed as an engineer, was charged with tttering a forged 101. Bank of England note Ito Mr. Joseph Pridgeon, the landlord of the Coachmakers' Arms, Robert-street, Blackfriars-road.
Mr. Pridgeon said that on Saturday evening, shortly after 7 'clock, the prisoner came into his house and presented a dirty and old-looking 101. Bank of England note for change, stating that it was for Mr. Perkins, a neighbour, who kept a beershop.

Iron Shipbuilding.-Newcastle-Upon-Tyne,
[RON SHPBuuDING.-NEWCASTLE-tupON-TTNz, April 8.-The Russian Government have seat extensive orders to the north-east ports this spring forironscrew steamers to be built for the Black Sea. This week an iron screw steamer of 372 tons, built byMeessrs. T. and W. Smith, of North Shields, has been despatched to Odessa for the Russian service, and Messrs. Charles Mitchell andCo., of Low-Walker, are constructing a fleet of vessels
from 200 to 1,100 tons for the Russian service in the B' c
Sea, and Messrs. Lesslie and a Stockton house are similarly employed. Messrsm Iitchell and Co. are also building several iron paddlewbeel steamers for the Volga, and passenger steamers for St. Petersburg. They will also iauinh ths week the Mahmoudid, -wLich, with the Alexandria and Alfi, are built for the service of the Egyptian Steam Navi. gaPton Company. Their engines are built upon the oscillatin-g cylinder principle, and the vessels will be employed on the Nile. The employment of iron screw colliers in the coaltrade is also extending, and several are building on the Tyne at the present moment. An iron screw-steamer named the Lyon was despatched from. fessrs, .Mitchell and Co.'s to-day, to run between Sunderland and London. This vessel having to lie on the ground with a full cargo is cuiously constructed. The bottom is built on the edlular tubular principle, similar to -the Britannia bridge at Holy. head; and another iron screw of 1,500 tons is building for Mr. Hugh Taylor, of the Coal-Exchange, on similar principles. The Messrs. Palmer are building five iron vessels, and have despatched four since the new year, and other firms are well supplied with orders; so that this branch of iudustry is exceedingly brisk in the north.east ports.
Popr,UT. SupmsvTroNs.-There is hardly a village, we believe, in all England, in which there is not some man or woman whso enjoys a reputation for being more or less "w wise" in supernatural matters; while regularly, onco ayear, those rival disciples of Caghostro, Messrs. Zadkiel and Raphael, in their Prophetic Almanac8, publish for the benefit of the world at large a twelvemonth's peep into futurity, and into the quackery of their opponent,-all for the small sum of one shilln I It is very easy to moralize upon this combination of Lnavery and ignoranco; to say w t a poor simpleton was this farmer Charlesworth, who paid his-wizard servant, James Tuanicliffe, considerable snms for taking off spells from his pigs, his cheese, and his baby, and for encountering the Prince of Darkness, in an empty room, with a knife and plate, at the end of which engeament, according to the witness, he carne out ail over" blue. ness." Mostpeople will agree that theaddition of a littleyeliow would form a combination of colour that would exactly express the shade of his dupe's mental complexion. It is all very well to pen expressions of sorrow at the superstitious ignorance evinced by those foolish people who besought the magistrate whose letter is before the public to have a reputed witch, " proven," by swimming her irn the nearest pit, and seeing whether she sank or swam- to wonder how itineraut magicians find their victims in these practical times, and where the 120,000 subscribers for Raphael's astrological nonsense come from. But is this aU ? Is the evil confined to little country villages, among poor uneducated people? or is there something else abroad, bearing a very strong family likeness to it, practised in great cities and towns, among people who are not poor and uneducated? Table-turning was, as we all know, a favourite pursuit in drawing-room and boudoir, ntil Professor Faraday invented that little tell-tale machine, by which it was divested of the supernatural, which was its only charm. As soon as it was demonstrated to be a mere physical matter no one cared about it. Spirit-rap ing followed, and is now in high favour both at home and on the continent. If James Tunnicliffe had had the wit to set up as a rmedium, and give seanes to the aristocracy, he would have rmadea good thing of it, andwould not now be pickiD osalm in gaol. We have notthe least doubt that this TunnicBfe was a swindler, and that Mr. and Mrs. F., of Hockham, were very silly people; the process by which we come to this conclusion is by using our ordinary reasoning powers. Let us apply these to the other branch of mysteries which it is not considered ignorant or debasing at present to believe in, and we must return pretty much the same verdict as to t. professors and believers. We know that many of these accredited mediums are persons of very low origin and very mueagre education-no higher in the scaZe of inteli'gence than some of those whom we send to hard labour for prac. tising the art of divination. Let us pause a moment, then, in moralizing upon the ignorance and credulity of the lower orders, and inquire if their betters are entirely free from Similar im utations.-fancaster Guardien.
919E 'EW TEA AIND SUGARDUTIEs.-The officials of the Bristol Custom-house were actively eneaged on Monday and Tuesday in receiving the ner scale of duty on tea sugar, &c., and delivering produce. The collector, ar. Ambrose Foote, materially facilitated operations by permit hng checks for duty to be deposited oe Saturday, by which arrangement before 9 oaclock on Monday morning the necessary papers had been filled up, and both tea and sugars were ready for delivery by the lockers. In the course of the day 11,5711. was paid on tea, o°7101. on sugar, and 3471. on coffees, making a total of se,628d., Sn addition to about 1,001. duty paid on other articies. The payment of duty continued very active on Tuesday, in the course of which day nearly 5,0001 were received on account of tea alone. The Bristol customs' account for the year ending the 31st of March last showvs an increase of 106,834L. over the preceding year. The total receipts considerably exceeded 1,000O,Qwl., and showv that Bristol is second alone to Liverpool among provincial ports in the amount of customs' receipts.
IRoxMASTES' QuARTERLY MEETING.-B EMINGnAmr, Thursday.-There was a fair attendance of the trade, and representatives from London and Liverpool houses were present in considerable force. The firmness, with which prices were maintained at Wolverhampton the Previous day was, if possible, still more strongly mauifested; and it is understood that a considerable amount of business was transacted in the town-hall during the day. In almost every particular our account of the meeting at Wolver hampton, sentyesterday, is applicable to the proceedings of a meeting held in Birmingham to-day. The smaUer and inferior makers'complain of slackness, but the large makers of first-class brands are full of orders.

Sir,-" Habitans in Sioco " and others have lately been declaiming against the inefficient preaching of the clergy of -the Church of England, and have beer ingenious in discovering causes amd proposing remedies. Now I. Sir, do not pretend toanyof the talent of these " great ulknowons.1 However, I have aome acquaintuace with the subiect as the result of my own experence in different parts of Englnd. Let me, then, suppose * very commoa case. The Rev. Dr. Dotlieboys takes pupils, hut his reverence does not like the drudgery, so he looks out for a tutor. He considers how he may get one cheapest, and it occurs3to him at once to offer a
A title, mind you, is a great recommendation to a "fast" man whose character will not bear investigating too closely. The rev. doctor, aooordingly, receives many applica. tions from men of this charcter - and, of cours, chooses out the best and cheapest But wMiat 13the result?
This poor unfortunate young man, who comprises in himself so many occupations-e. g., tuition, parish work, keeping his pupils in order at Ieson time, and joining with them in amusements at playtime; who has, bedides, to be "'fool," "jester," and " ladies man" at the vicarage,-haz also-lt, not least-to write what he never wrote beforea sermon weeldy.
Is it any wonder that his sermons are not his own, that they cost him 10d. each, that he has not even read them before he takes them into the pulit * or that if his, he has not had time to correct and pohsh them ?
The bishops, indeed, are far from blameless in this matter. Only the other day a college friend wrote me that he had been ordained to a curacy where there were but seven houes in the parish, and the vicar himself was resdent. I need not add that tuition was his employment, and that he neither was nor could have been wanted as a curate. I enclose his letter for your own private satisfaction.
Take another case. The vicar of the parish in which I am, resides, takes pupils, and wants a tutor. In order to get one cheap he offers a title; yet his parish contains a population of only 400, and the living is worth but 160L
a hava yet to learn that the occupation of a tutor confers a cl im to a "title," or that a B.A. ought to be ordained to a pnvate tutorship.
I enclose my name and address, but not for publication; and

Lundhill Colliery Explosion.
LUNDHILL COLLIBRY EXPLOSION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-While sympathizing with your correspondent in his laudableefforts to lessen the dangers of miners, I cannot but think, from the little knowledge I possess of coal mining, of te utter impracticability of introducing the lamp which he proposes into the workings of coal minmes.
His principle of ventiation, so far as I can see, is that carried out in all the Marquis of Londonderry's mines in the county of Durham, and it would be well if some of our mining reformers were to pay a visit to the Stewart Collieries and judge for themaeives how far careful management and good venrilation have tended to reduce the number of these dreadful accidents-a fact which proves itself from there having been no accident of this sort since 1817 on the Stewrart estate.
As to lighting the mines with gas, like the streets of acitv, your correspondent may be very well acquainted with the surface, but quite unaware of the dilicelties of such an undertaking underground.
The introdnction of gas into the working '-stalls," "boards," or "headways' of a coal mine would be highly dangerous, and lead to an increase of those dreadful explosions wzhich have latterly been sO frequent.

DREADFUL FACTORY Ac mDT.-Mr. Jewison, one of the coronersfor the honour of Pontefract, held an inquest at the Oddfellowse-hall, Bradford, onWednesday afternoon,on the bodyofThornasSpofforth,a young man who met with adreadlal death in a worsted factory. The deceased, who was2l yearsof age,was employed asan overlooker in the factorv of Messms G. Brown and Co., manufacturers, Bradford. The engine, which had stopped during the breakfast. time on Friday morning last, having been again set in motion shortly before 9 o'clock, Spofforth made an endeavour, while a shaft in the third story of the mill wou in motion, to place a belt upon the revolving drum; he became entangled in the belt, was instantly drawn up to the shaft, around which he was whirled with great velocity, and he was frightfully mutilated in the half-minute that elapsed before the engine could be stopped. His right arm was wrenched from the body, one leg was severed below the knee, the other was torn off at the hip, and the unforttunate man's back was broken, and the spine shockingly twisted. Death must have been instantaneons. The foreman of the jury (Mr. J. Smith, chairman of the Bradford Poor Law guardians) expressed an opinion that an appliauce should abe uavers3 in factories by -which in case o accident the motive-power might immediately be arrested, and thus such frightful mutilation obviated, and, perhaps, loss of life prevented. He s'ated that he had such an improvement applied to the machinery in his extensive spinning factory The jury returned a verdict of " Accidental death"
ExTmxsmvE AND DESTRUCTIVE FIR} AT LEEDs.- -Between land 2 o'clock yesterday (Thursday) morning the premises of Messrs. R. and J. arrison, mustard and chicory manufacturers, Jack-lane, Holbeck, Leeds, were discovered to be on fire, and before the arrival of the fireengines the flames had extended so rapidly that all efforts to save the main building were ineffectual, and the machinery and stock were entirely destroyed. As the flames extended several adjoining cottages were endangered, and, though the efforts of the firemen were successful in confining the fire to the factory, the woodwork of the cottages was very much charred. About 3 o'clock the west end of the factory fell outwards, and a great portion of it went through the roof of a cottage, and buried, a woman named Harriet Redshaw, while other portions knocked down the foreman of one of the fire-brigades, and injured several of the firemen. The woman Redshaw was rescued as soon as possible, and removed to the Tnfirmary, where she lies in a very precarious state. The proprietors are insured to the extent of 1,5001. in the Manchester In8urance-offlce, but the damage will probably exceed 5,0001.
T rH. TE SuLTAN oF MuscAT.-The Sultan or Imaum of Muscat, whose death was announced a short time since, was so remarkable a Prince as to deserve some notice of his character and extended reign. An Oriental Sovereign who establishes a finn empire over dominions before unsettled, who cultivates the arts of peace, who forms wise and useful alliances with Western Powers, and whose reign is prolonged for more than half a century, must poEsess qualities deserving of admiration. Syed or Said, the deceased Sultan, came to the throne in 1806, at the age of 17 years. His dominions were partly in Asia and partly in Africa. Muscat, from which he derived his title, is a very considerable seaport and commercial depot in the province of Oman, on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, and commanding the narrow entrance of that gulf. Oman, the most easterly portion of Arabia, and about 350 miles in length, constituted the Asiatic dominion of the Imaum, which he delivered from vassalage to theMWahabees. But he also partly inherited and partly wrested from the Portugueso a territory several hundred miles in length on the eastern coast of Africa, called Zanguebar, with a large and beautiful island caUed Zanzibar, in which island he resided during the latter years of his life. The Imaum of Muscat was a man of dignified and noble presence, but not a warrior. His conquests wereeffected chiefly by means of his alliances, and especially by his alliance with England and the East India Company. He formed a considerable navy of five English-buUt frigates, but he employed them in commerce, not in war, and carried on a very extensive trade with India and various parts of the East. LiLe Mehemet Ali, he traded largely on his own account, and thereby accumulated riches, which he did not, hlke the Pasha of Egypt, squander in warlike enterprises. He had the sagacity not merely to avoid the quarrels and intrigues to which Oriental Princes are so prone, but to fortify himself by treaties with the strongest maritime Powers-namely, England, France, and the United State-, and to remain perfectly faithful to his engagements. At a time when tho slave trade was largely carried on from his coases he entered into a compact with our Government to put down the traffic, and he did so externally, though not within his own dominions. He was vwise enough to encourage foreign commerce by very low Customs duties, and thus he gratified his love of money more effectually than by rapaciously grasping it. He also made extensive plantations of sugarcanes, cloves, and coffiee, and thereby enriched himself aud his people. While an aly of England and never giving ground of offence or jealousy,he yet concluded a special treaty with the United States relative to the trade of Zanzibar, in consequence of which the American trade with that fertile and populous island is much greater than the English. In 18O4 he concluded a treaty with France. By such wise measures he laid solid foundations for his own power and prosperity, and a great part of his long reign was devoted to the quiet reaping of the frnita which he had sown. He was not ainan of high moral quahities, but bis wisdom as a ruler has not often been surpassed. -He has left no children by his two wives, butone of his sons by a concubine was Governor of Zanzibar, and the Govern. ments of England and France have agreed to recognize his eldest son as his heir. According to the Journal DDfbas, to which vve are inaebted for many of the above facts, the French Government has sent a frigate to Zanzibar, not perhaps without some viewv to the pes3ibility of that island or the territory of Zanguebar falling into French bamds. Theinora nteresting part of the late Imaun's dominions, hovever, is that which commands the entrance to the Persian Gilf, and which will become of still greaterimportance when the railway from Seleucia to the Euohrates and tho
navigafion of that great river shall rm.a;e the Persian GulfJ )k highway to tT.nd-Lectdejfrcu-j-1,

Sir,-3y Iventre to requet that yow xill insert In your valuable paper a few lines from mein confration of the acount contained in your oolumns of to-day of ths Echoolin the neighbourhood of the Victoria Docks ? I sm a stranger to the district, but, having had ooosion lsu week to go over the greater prt of ie, I was ruch. struck with the mierable condition of its inhabitants. In addi. tion to tho want of drainage and accumulation of ewage matter in -the open marh ditches, which, green in oolour and fetid in smell, Is enough to cauee a far greater amount of icklness than is at present the ea. Mr. Brady should have mentioned the total abence of foot pavement, and gravelled road, exoept in the few main sreets. In Ehor# it is a town without roads, without lighting, without pavement, without drainage, and without sewers. In the midast of this dismal swamp eisks the shool of which Mr. Brady ha given so faithful a desgeiption, and he could not have been more surprise4 than I was on enter ing the wretched hovel in which itig held at thi cisnl.

In these respects theymnight challenge comparison with I belteve, any of the; national schools fiabe agriculturaprishes of the county. The young mistre spoke hopefully of her tharge, in spite of the nniealtht nature of the neighbourhood, which had evidently told on herself.
I *pIogise, Sir, for trespassing at such length on your valuable sae, but my desire has ceen, if poibe, to aist in directmg the hand of chrity to *n objeot where the slightest assistnce wold be most worthily given, and I thmnk I may add moat gratefolli'received.

The Dwellings Of The Poor.
THE DWTLLINGS op THEp POo
TO T1E EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES.
Sir,-Every wellwisher to humanity must feel glad that you have so prominently noticed Dr. Letheby's excellent and valuable report-startling, no doubt, to thousnds in this great city, but far from being so to the medical offioers attached to our dispensaries and parishes, and those others who, like Dr. Letheby, are in the habit of visig the cloge lanes, courts, and alleys ten anted by the labouting popula. tion. Were confirmation necessary, I could, from the personal experience of nearly 30 years, endorse every word that he hab uttered, and at the same time add that the evil has, in my experience, rapidly a nd dangerously increased, and I believe it to be stil feafully progressing. Nor can this be wondered at, when we take into consideration the number of dwellings that were inhabited by the poor which have been removed to make way for modem improvements -for open spaces, wide streets, mansions, and railroads. There seems to be but one remedy for the monstrous evis now, nor fortho first time, brought to light-the building a number of decent dwellings to supply the place of those destroTed,-a task certainly difficult, but never so easy of accomplishment as at the present moment. The experiment of model lodginghonses has suoeeded beyond expectation. Let this system be carriedout upon a large sle, and at any rate much of the misery now existing will be obviatod.
There are two extensive plots of ground now vacant in the very centre of the manufacturing industry of London, which could not be more advantageously employed than in forming the sites of such masses of buildings-the one, Commercial-street, Spitalfields, leading from the London Docks to the terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway in Shoreditch, the property, as I am told, of the Woods and Forests, which has been lying fallow for 12 years; and the other, a large space almo at within pistol shot of your own offiee, at the north end of Farringdon-street, stretching beyond ClerkenweU Sessions-house, almost to the church. Why not devote these-why not devote Smithfield itself to this patriotic work? The answer may be that such an undertaking would be too gigantic for private individuals, or even for a society. If so, it is not too great for Govern. ment fo accomplish; and although it may be the maxim of Government not to employ money in any speculative objects, this is an exceptional case; and it is surely their duty to arrest viee, to stay pestilence, to instil habits of order, sobriety, cleanliness, decency, and religion, and to mako as many happy, contented, and virtuous as circumstauces will admit of. As you justly say, the permitting such scenes as sre described in your number of yesterday to exist " is not only an evil, bnt a crime; and the crimeis shared -by all who can do anything to abate it and leave it undone." Lord Shaftesbury and hi philanthropic friends have done a good deal, though it is but little comparatively; and it is only the hand of Government that can he brought to bear efficiently on such a vast amount of desolation and misery.

SUICIDE BY PRUSSIC ACID.-On Wednesday night
SUICDE BY PBituJSI Am.-On Wednesday night an inquest was held before Lr. Taylor, coroner, at Bolton, touehing the death of a WomaD named Leah Hoagin, or Perkin, aged 35, who was found dead in her bedroom tle day previous. The son of the unfortunate woman said he saw his mother go upstairs with a jug before dinner, and she never came down again, and when he went up he saw her lying on the floor as described. Mr. Bilsborow, druggist, recollected selling a pennyworth of the " essence " of bitter almonds to a servant girl, either on Monday orTuesday, but he had seen deceased, and it was not she. The quantity would not contain more than four or five drops, it beirg diluted in spirits of wine,-one part to seven of spirits. (This is not really the essential oil of almonds, but what is called " almond flavour.") It is commonly sold for cooking purposes, under the name of "ratifee." The body of deceased had a healthy appearance outwardly, and was free from marks of external violence; on examining the chest, the heart and lungs were found in a healthy condition, bnt on opening the abdomen a strong odour of oil of almonds was perceived. The abdominal viscera were in a healthy condition. Tho stomach had an inflammatory redness, and contained about two ounoes of fluid appearing like milk Death must have taken place in a few minutes after tsadng the dose,-not more than five or ten minutes, from the quantity taken. The quantity described by Mr. Bilsborow would not have been sufficientshe musthavehadnear a teaspoonfuL Deoeased wasnot pregnant, and died from the effects of oil of almonds. Deceased had 23s. in her pocket when found, aud the police had made a most minute search of tho premises, but nothing was found disturbed, nor was there any bottle or vessel which appeared to havecontainedthepoison, nor could the reason of her destroyin6 herself be ascertained. The jury retmrned a verdict, " that deceased destroyed herself by taking essential oil of almonds- but there was no evidence as to the state of her mind at ihe time ;" thereby avoidinga verdict of fdo c se.-Manchaetcr Ramincr.
MlusicAL, DRAsrATic, Axi EQuSRL&?y SICKFLU.D AssocATox.-Yesterday evening the first anniversary festival of this newly established charity was celebrated in the most auspicions manner at Willis's-roo2s, King-street, St. Jamos's. M. Tom Taylor took the chair, supported by Mr. Higgins, Mr. Mark Lemon, Mr. J. Leech, Captain Eaton, Messrsm Bradbury and Evans, Mr.Cook, Mr.C. Read, Mr. .L W. Phillips, Captain Cook, Mr. Sams, Mr. Stocqueler, &c. About 100 guests sat down to dinner, including among them the chief histrionic representatives of what are, perhaps, miscalled the minor theatres of this metropolis. he dinner, which in itself was good, was made still better by the admirable manner in which it was served, At its conclusion the chairman gave the customary loyal and patriotic toasts, and displayed a considerable amount of tact and skill in connecting them with the subject-matter in hand. He alluded to the mnunificent patronage which Her 3fajesty bestowed upon the professors of the drama, and in the toast of the "Army and Navy," referred most happily to the amateur performances among the troops before Sebastopol, andthe sailors plays, which during the lonz night of an Arctic wvinter relieved the tedium and beguiled the terrors of that dreary ice-bound region. In proposing the toast of the evening he dwelt with force and eloquence upon the claims of the humble association the first anniversary of which they were then metto inaugurate. Afternoticing the many vicissitudes of an astor's career, and its ran?id transitions in reality "from grave to gay, from lively to severe," especially with those who after a hard week's work had their demands upon the manager referred to an empty treasury, the chairman went on to point out the di erence between this association and the theatrical funds which already existed. Its object was, not to provide retiring pensions only to those who had contributed to its funds; its relief was bestowed in a different manner, aud amengdifferent classes. It was intended, in the first place that the society should be an independent agent between managers and actors who wished for engagements. The sphere of its more benevolent operations included notonly actors, whethermusical, dramatic, or otherwise, but scene-painters, costumiers, an even scene-shifters were in
necessities considered among the qualified recipients of its aid. Even the " mouldy grabs," as the equestrian performers were often nic= ed were entitled to call from their " native sawdust" upon the help of this association. (" Hear, hear," and much laughter) Already it had been wel supported, and already its subscribers included an immense number of names-even of those of the profession in America, who bad testified their sympathy with the cause b forwarding their Transatlantic aid towards its funds. Wle therefore called upon them to drink, " Prosperity and success to the association," and let one and all exert themselves so that it might live and flourish bravely. The toast was drunk with loud acclamation. In returning thanks for the officers ofthe association Mr. Anson, the secretary, stated that out of 33,000 registerd benefit sick funds which ministered tothe wants of upwards of 3,000,000 of people, there was not one which ndministered to the comforts of the dramatic and equestrian performer in his hours of sickness and of need. He was glad to say that the society alreadypossessed a fand amounting to 6401., and he had received fetters from Mr. Webster, Mr. Wigan, Mfr. B. T. Smith, and others, regretting their absence on the occasion of their first anniversary, but enclosing munificent subscriptions to the funds of the charity. DurinR the course of the evening upwards of 1001.
.as subscribed in the room, and the proceedings, which were characterized btieutmostmirth and good feeling, terminatedearly. he musical arrangements were most excellent, and Mr. Toole made an efficient toastmaster.
