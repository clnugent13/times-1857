NOMINATIONS.
THE ELECTIONS.
dry OF LONDON. The nomination took place yesterday, in the Guildhall. When the doors were thrown open the upper half of the hail -was soon filled, and the assemblage afterwards received largo accessions to its numbers. Benches were reserved on.tbe right and left of the hustings for the diplomatic body, and for ths female relatives and friends of the candidates. Perak Khan, the Envoy from tho Court of Persia, who was accompanied by Captain Lynch and four members of his suite, occupied a place on the left of tho hustings. The Persian visitors, who wore tho long black cap and shawl robes of their country, listened withdocoronsgravity, hut with something of a pnzzied air, to tho shouts, groans, and clamour which characterized the proceedings. Mr1 Dallas, the American Minister, was also present. Lady John Russell entered the hall a little before 12 o’clock, leaning upon the arm of the Lord Mayor, and was accommodated with a seat on the right of the hustings. Her lady, ship was accompanied by one of her younger sons. The hustings were crowded with the friends Of the respective candidates, among whom were some of the principal merchants and bankers of the city. The cheers of the meeting announced at 12 o’clock the arrival of the candidates. Lord J, Rnssell, who was accompanied by his eldest son, was received with considerable cheering. Baron Rothschild was also favourably received, but the cheers for tho other candidates were mingled with some histes. After theusual formalities, Mr. Sheriff Meohi briefly addressed the meeting, entreating an impartial hearing for the candidates. Mr. J, A. Hankey proposed Lord John Rnssell, amid mingled cheers and hisses, the former, however, predominating. It was now 16 years since they had elected Lord J. Rnssell as their representative, and during the whole ot that time ho had been a consistent and Uniform supporter of a Uboral policy. (A cry—“ How about Vienna?’) The war had been made a protest for delaying every measure of improvement, and m Lord J. Rnssell they had a statesman who would endeavour to introduce those reforms which were so much needed ill the representation. (Cheers.) Mr. F. Bennooh seconded the nomination of a noble lord whom ho would call the most distinguished statesman of the present day. He denied that ail the members for the City of London ought necessarily to be engaged in commerce, and contended that the city could spare at least one of its members to devote himself to the higher questions of philoBophical legislation. It waain vain to deny that the noble lord had been abandoned at the present election hy a large number of the merchant princes of London who professed to be Liberals, but tb© noble lord had upon no occasion shown a wiser judgment than when he appealed from the 20 genilemen who represented the Liberal Registration Association to tho 20,000 electors of the city. (Cheers.) Alderman Webe proposed Baron Rothschild amid the cheers of the meeting, and called upon the electors to be tine to their old principles of civil and religious liberty* iur* T, Dakin seconded the nomination* Mr. Maiotkeau proposed Alderman Sir J. Duke. Xu consequence of the illness of Mr. Masterman, the absence of Baron Rothschild, and tho inability of Lord J. Rnssell to take a part in the local business of the city, the principal harden of the representation had fallen on Sir J. Duke, and their gratitude on this account ought alone to secure his reelection. Mr. J. Chatman, in seconding tho nomination, bora testimony to the services rendered by Sir J. Duke to tho shipping and commercial interests. ‘“&• J- Dillon came forward to propose Mr. R. W. Crawford, but his appearance was the signal for a storm of hisses, groans, and cries of “ traitor.” Mr. Sheriff Mechi in yam endeavoured to obtain a hearing for Mr. Dillon, and that gentleman, after addressing the meeting with much vehemence of gesticulation, turned to the reporters on his right, and delivered Ms speech to them. He was understood to deny the charge of treachery which had been brought agaiust hun. Ho had in his pocket a letter sent hire by Lord J. Russell, which no human eye but his own had seen, m which the noble lord stated that it was not his intenbon to stand again for the city of London. That letter was brought to him by Mr. J. A. Smith, and he could only account for the existence of the rumour that Lord John was about to retire hy supposing that the contents of that letter were known to other! besides himself. He regarded the noble lord as an honourable patriot and as a great and useful man ; but he did not love his faults, and he thought he had committed two great faults, one at Vienna and one in his vote on the China question. He had heard with astonishment that Lord J. Rnssell was about to receive the votes of the Tories. Why, one wonld suppose the very stones in the pavement of Gnildhall would rise against such a change in the position of the noble lord. Mr. Dillon at length retired from tho platform amid the same expressions of disapprobation which had greeted his appearance. Mr. J. P. GASSIOT seconded the nomination of Mr. Crawford amid great uproar, which frequently rendered him inaudible. t Mr. W. G. Prescott proposed Mr. Eaikes Currie, whom he eulogized as a commercial man and a stanch and enlightened Reformer. (Cheers and hisses.) Mr. A, Andebson seconded the nomination in a few sentences, and amid continued confusion. Lord John Russell then advanced to the front of the hustings, and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers, which were repeatedly renewed, and continued for some moment-. Some manifestations of disapprobation from different parts of the hall were met hy a burst of cheering. When the applause had subsided the noble lord, who was evidently affected by the cordial welcome accorded to him, said—X ascribe tho kind reception which you have given me to the fact that 1 stand here to vindicate the independence of the electors ot the city of London. I cannot think it right that any select set ot gentlemen should tell yon, not only what class of members you ought to return, but who should be the particular persons whom you ought to choose from that class. It appears to me, indeed, that such a system would he one of intolerable dictation. (Hear, hear.) I may, perhaps, be allowed to refer to some statements that have been made by Mr. Dillon. I entertain great respect for that gentleman, and I hope nothing I may say of him will be inconsistent with that respect. It is quite true that Mr. Dillon received a letter from me expressing my intention to decline tho honour of coming forward as a candidate on this occasion; but he had previously received another letter from me informing him that I meant to conrider maturely what course I should pursue, and,as the election could not take place until some time after that letter was written, I thought that at least several days would be allowed me to come to a decision. In determining what conree I should take X considered thatlhad for alengthened period discharged the duties of one of yonr representatives (cheers), that those duties were by no means light, and that I might properly resign them to others when the prirreipTu, 0f free trade had, even by the avowal of their opponents, been firmly established. Bat, gentlemen, when I found that at a meeting not very numerous—and which had probably been pre-arranged with agood dealof care (“Hear,” andlanghter)— it was presumed without any authority that I had resumed • when! found that Mr. Dillon had not thought proper to uu€ntori4i?od ^at impression,and to state that ho knew I had not made up my mind to ream although I admit he was not bound to do so; when I fount! trilhont“T^?mbe«,Of^0 el®ctors h*4 c°me to a decision, without, I believe, the discussion of any proposal in the shape of a general resolutioni excluding me from the honour of representing the city of London, f felt, having served you for many years with fidelity and integrity, though I may, no doubt, have committed many errors, that thus to exclude mo was an insult to myself and an ininrv to the electors of the city of London. (Cheers.) Ruder these circumstances I could entertain no doubt as to the course 1 should pursue, and I determined not to shrink from this contest (cheers), however severe it might be, and however small might be the number ot electors who polled for me, but to come here and put it to the constituency at large whether they will confirm or deny the decree of the selfconsbtuted power to which X have referred. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Dillon tells me, gentlemen, that he does not likamv faults. (A laugh.) Very welL I have no doubt that I (fitter and cheers); but I wonder whether, when tho Registration Association put forward four gentlemen to represent yon, they ascertained that no ono of them had any fault whatever, (Renewed laughter and cheering.) Are we to presume that we have beftre us today four faultless candidates for the honour of representing n%Tb0iia7S been by four faultless proposeil and iOur faultless seconders J (Lend laughter and cheers.) s u J*?1*- ,aD1 Q“i*e ready to admit my faults, but I doubt very much whether in this citv of London you would be able to find four men to sit in the House of Commons—unless, indeed, they stayed away, as one of them has frequently done—who would not commit faults in the conduct of public business. (Cheers.) There was another point upon which Mr. Dillon enlarged with some vehemence. He says he hears I am to have the support of a great number of Tories. I don’t know how that may b.ut ^Clm v°ry well understand that,although gentlemen holding Conservative opinions may have ao sympathy with me as Tones, they may sympathize with me as Englishmen. ww'-wu.tl3 i??i.,eelSgJ9f pogJiriunen—be they Tories, he they_ Whigs, be they Radicals, or be they Chartists-to desire to see fair play. (Okies of “Bravo.” and cheers.) mey know that I have nothadfair play (cheers), and they wish to see justice done to me. (A Voice.—“ So we will to-morrow.”) (Loud cheers.) The resolution passed inttm first instance by the committee in their secret councils, and afterwards brought forward and adopted at a meeting without discussion, and apparently without any direct reference to me, declared it expedient that the city of London should be represented by four commercial men. Now, I donbt, gentlemen, whether you should accept that proposition. I don t think it is necessary that every commercial town should have none but commercial representatives. (Cheers.) Such a practice has not prevailed either in this city or in other places, and it must bo remembered that Parliament is wdleduponto dea1 very extensively with public business which does not at all partake of a commercial character. Liverpool is a great commercial port, and was fora longtime represented by Mr. Canning, who held high office under the Crown, but who was not connected with the mercantile business of the port. Mr. Husldsson, who succeeded Mr. Canning in the representation of Liverpool, although holding office at the Board of Trade, was unconnected with the local commercial business of tho town. I say, then that a bad general maxim was put forward, but I do not be^ lieve it was advocated in sincerity as a maxim which should always be observed. I believe it was put forward in order that no nsk might be ran by excluding my name directly from the list of candidates, but that an attempt was made indirectly to debar me from again becoming one of vonr representatives, (Hear, hear.) I think, however, gentle;
ln0?» “other question , is involved in . this election, which it Proves all electors to consider,—namely, the independent* of Parliament. I quite allow that Lord Palmerston is a man who is fit to preside over the councils of this ind hisaes.) 1 think he deserves the support of the House of Commons and of tho nation (cheers); hut I cannot admit that if the House ot Commons *0*® ^adverse to the Governmentthey, or the majority of them, are to be stigmatized as desiring to make thedegradation audhmniliation of their cottntry a steppinestoa© to power. (Cheers.) I think tho Home of Commons ought to bo independent, and, that they ought to vote nponfhe ments of every question. They may commit errors, hut they should have a free and independent choice, and they ought not to he browbeaten as they have been by any Sfrmsfm:. (Cheera.) There are some other questions to wWchlwiriit0 refer. (Cheers and interruption.) I will not detain you long, but, as I am standing ilone against a powerful combination, I wish to explain the grounaTupon which I claim your suffrages. (Cheeis.) I think that amSng the measures proposed to the House of Commons onghtto hi one for a considerable extension of the suffrage. (Cheers. 1 ? ?£d?tL m ‘ha first instance as theoigaa of my own Admmistrafaon, and subsequently as the organ ot Lord Aberdeen s Administration, to introduce a measure which contained provisions for extending tho right of voting I have sometimes been accused of inertness in these matters Krfhte w**7 owin8 to the want of support both in fte House of Commons and tho country that I was induced not to persevere with that measure. j? ‘hero is now a disposition among the people to support a measure of that kind. X trust that that disposition will grow ao strong that snob a measure may be earned by a majority of the next House of Commons.

(Cheers.) Mr. R. W. Cbaweord on presenting himself was received with mingled cheering and disapprobation. He said ■that he appeared before toe electors as a candidate, selected and approved by a great number of his fellow-citizens, to vindicate their choico and to justify himself for the assumption of that position. Ha came forward to afford them an opportunity of carryinginto effect a principle which it was proposed at toe last general election to embody in his person, and which was, therefore, of a date antecedent to the resolution carried too other day by the meeting of tho liberal Registration Association (yells and hisses)—toe principle that commercial men should represent a commercial city. He was not there to disparage his competitors or to inquire into their motives, hut to claim tho right of an elector of tho city to call in question the public acts of public men. There observations had especial reference to the peculiar position ha now occupied with regard to lord J. RusseU. When proposed to them' as a candidate at the last general election it would bo’ remembered that he declined, to avail himself of the power then offered to him of entering too House of Commons, because he was unwillmg to do anything that might jeopardize the great mtercsts of the country which were then at stake, and the fate of ■ jSivTi hnngnpon the decision ot toe metropohtan constituency,.

(Cheers.) Mr. Raises Currie was received with cheers and expressions of disapprobation. Being unable to obtain a , bearing from the audience, the hon. gentleman turned to the reporter on Ms left, and addressed Ms speech to them. He said that, in obedience to tho call of his follow-citizens, and not of any association, he stood before them as a candidate. At their bidding ho had said farewell to a constituency as intelligent, generous, and faithful as any man ever represented. He had done so because ho believed that the Imperial city of London, wMoh was justly entitled to lead and guide the country, had a decided opinion to express at the present moment. He believed that the electors wished to say,—“We will support against all factious movements, whether premeditated or accidental, the Government of Lord Palmerston, which, whatever else ft did, or failed to do, protected commerce, upheld the honour of toe country.

The proceedings terminated at a few minutes after 2 oolock* MARYLEBONE. This election took place yesterday. As there was no opposition to tho return of Sir B. Hall and Lord Ebrington, toe proceedings did not fast more than au hour, and there was an utter absence ot too excitement usual at elections. The audience was by no means numerous, and, to all ap. pearanoe, consisted almost entirely of non-electors. There were but few interruptions to toe general good humour, and these proceeded cMefly from one or two individuals who persisted in throwing in at intervals inapposite remarks rather after toe manner ot that singular old lady, “ Mr. Ps. aunt,” such as “How about the bishops,” “ Down with the taxes,” “No Germans,” “ Hurrah for iTNeill and Tnllocb,” and so on. Lord Ebrington, who is at present abroad, was repre. rented by his brother, toe Hon. T. W. Fortesoue. After tho reading of toe writ and tho usual formalities. The returning officer, Mr. G. TampUn, having bespoken a fair hearing for all parties, Mr. J. Bell proposed Sir B. Hall as a fit and proper person to represent too borough in Parliament. Ho had been their representative for 20 years, and daring the whole of that time his political conduct had been consistent and straightforward. He had always taken too greatest interest in their local affairs, and Ms devotion to too principle of local self-government, had been been shown by Mg bill for the regulation ot the metropolis. Mr, Stockton seconded too nomination. Professor Key proposed Lord Ebrington in a somewhat discursive speech, in toe course of wMoh he touched upon the China debate, Lord Palmerston's foreign policy, the Sunday Trading Bill question, and concluded by eulogizing toe noble lord eg a manly and honest politician, a zealous social reformer, and a true friend of the working classes. Mr, Whitmore seconded toe nomination. No other candidate being nominated, Tho returning officer proclaimed Sir B. Hall and Lord Ebrington duly elected amid general cheering. Sir B. Hall then presented himself to the electors. It was now 20 years, ho said, since he had been first returned for toe borough, and this made tho seventh time that he had been elected. He felt deeply grateful for the additional honour wMch they had conferred upon Mm, snd ha could assure them that Ms best energies wonld bo devoted to their service. The representative of a great constituency, such as Marylehone, could not expect to please everybody by hm coarse of conduct; if he attempted it ho would enffi hke the old man and Mg agg, by pleasing nobody; and ho had, therefore, in all toe votes he had given consulted Ms own judgment and conscience, confident that, though at toe first blush they might he contrary to toe opinions of soma of his constituents, time would show that he had taken the most prudent coarse. He had always been ready, more-
eve-, to explain Ms conduct, and had never shrunk from doing it whenever toe opportunity wag afforded to him. (“Why did yon rote against Roebuck's motion J”) That waaa.question easily answered. Ho had good reasons for votjng against that motion, and if it wore to be done over again he shorffd vote in toe same way. At too very moment that that motion was made ft was generally believed that Loti Palmerston was about to assume tho office of .War Minister, and there was a much greater fa*?6® putting too army in tho Crimea into a better state by confiding it to the charge of his nowe friend than by setting a committee of the House of Commons to inquire aad report. (Cheers.) That this was the sounder view was proved hy the fact that from toe moment that Lord Palmerston was made Prime Minister toe condition of toe army began to improve, while the committee which was appointed, after sifting and deliberating for months, ended % presenting a report which l??_fa no tangible result. (A Voice.—“How about LockC Jtmg’s motion?”) No one was a warmer advocate of afurtoer reform in toe representation of the people than he was: but when Locke King’s motion was brought forward the noble lord at toe head of the Government atated, that in too state of public business, With the possibility, nay, toe certainty of a dissolution impending, it was impossible to pass any measure of that nature that session. (“ Why did you vote against it then?") Ho had not voted against it, (Lheeis.) Nothmg was more certain, however, than that no Ministry conld staodlongin this country without hringim, forward some measure of Reform; and there was every reason to bo satisfied with too guarantee which Lord Palmersten had given on this subject. (An Elector.—" Where ?”) If toe loud-voiced gentleman wonld read the last paragraph of toe noble lord’s address to tho electors of Tiverton he WpnH see toe plrfge riven by toe noble lord on this subject. ( Idontsooit. ) That showed a want of capacity which J'a3S?a‘v be deplored, but still ft was gratifying to find that there wasonly one man present who had not inteUfaenoe enough to comprehend suoh plain language, (Load faughtor, and cries of “ Oh i he’s » Tory.”) Ho should go back to Parliament feeling deeply the honour which they had conferred upon Mm. In 1854 ho had presented himself before them for them approval of Ms acceptance, at toe sMimtationqt X*rd Palmerston, of toe offieo of President of the Board ot Health—an office ot great difficulty. He would appeal to those who had watched his official career whether during the time of the cholera he had not done Ms -o-—**« **7^ wwuwwM ncBoes snoa m he hop©d no men would ever again witness. Inconsequence, probably, of having done Ms duty in that office, he had been placed in a Mgherone—that of President of the Board of Works. In that office he had endeavoured to carry into practice the pnnciplesof administrative reform, and he did not think that any man would find fault with the manner in wMch he had administered Ms department. (Cheers.) He thanked them sincerely for tho honour which they had done Mm, not only on his own account, hut as a member of tbo Government, because the fact of a member of the Government being returned'to Parliament for a borough containing 400,000 inhabitants, and 20,000 electors would give strength to LordPalmerslon in bringing forward tnoM measures which wore necessary for the benefit of the public, and winch wonld conduce to toe happiness and prosperity of the empire. (Cheers.) Mr. Verey asked the right hon. baronet to explain Ms as to the equalization of poor-rates* Sir B.

V Tories CUE returned thanke on behalf of Ms brother for the honour wMch thoy had done him in thus electing him m Ms absence. EEs brother had explained Ms political principles to them on a former occasion, and ho act upto toewfp P1®1™8® on Ms behalf that ho wouldslwayg Mr. Beacon asked Sir B. Hall whether he was going to leave toe bishops to their fate; and also whether hewas prepared to sanction a vote of 70,0001. to some foreign Ynnco to carry off one ot our Princesses ? (Laughter.) Sir B, Halt, thought that appointments to too episcopal bench such as those lately made by Lord Palmerston would go far to remove those abuses against wMoh his efforts had been formerly directed. As to the second question, he presumed that under too present Sovereign it was not deemed to do anything different from that wMoh had been done on former occasions. (Loud cries of "Oh I") He was not aware that any sum had boon namedfor the purpose alluded to, but this was certain, that suoh was the admirable management ot toe illustrious lady now seated on the throne of this country that daring the whole 20 years ot her reign no message had been sent to the House of Commons to tax too {cheers.) °°Ter extraTagant 11114 lavish expenditure. The proceedings then terminated after a vote of thanks to the returning officer. FINSBURY. The nomination of toe candidates for toe representation of this constituency took place at noon yesterday, at the hustings erected in front of the sessions-house, Clerkenwellgreen, wMch was crowded by about 8,000 of toe electors and the unenfranchised. There was an entire absence of that excitement which was occasioned at elections previous to the last Act against bribery hy the arrival of the candidates accompanied hy flags, bands of music, and other noisy demonstrations; but the crowd, nevertheless, amgi^ed themselves till the commencement of too proceedings by various jokes at the expense of Major Reed, Mr. Cox, and Serjeant Parry, and as soon as the proceedings began they became uproarious. The speeches of tho candidates and of those gentlemen by whom they were introduced were therefore cut short, toe whole of them having occupied little more than an hour. It was admitted on all hands that Mr, Dun combe’s long and faithful career in the House of Commons will secure his return; toe real contest being between Major Reed, Mi-. Cox, and Mr. Serjeant Parry (aft liberals and supporters of Lord Palmerston’s foreign policy) for toe vacancy occasioned by the retirement of Alderman Mr- Duncombo’e short address was well received, and Mr. Bon cant Parry obtained analmost equally favourable heating, while Mr. Cox and Major Reed were scarcely permitted to speak. On, a show of hands, however. Major Need appeared to stand next to Donoombe, “Finsbury’s pet, and at _ no great distance from Major Rood stood Mr. Serjeant Parry, there being only a third of tbo crowd in favour of Mr. Cox. The hustings occupied a.iarge space of ground, and very ample accommodation was given to the representatives of the press. • T51! proceedings having been opened precisely at 12 o clock by Mr. James, the returning officer, with the usual preliminaries, Mri “W. Graham proposed for re-election that long-tried and stanch Reformer, Mr. Thomas Slingshy Buncombe (lond cheers), who had represented Finsbury for nearly a quarter of a century, ^ Ifr. G. SH3XUBEEE* in seconding the nomination, expressed a hope tnat the electors would put Mr* Buncombe at the head oi the poll* (Cheers,) Mr, W. Dennis proposed Mr. 'William Cox (hisses and cheers), and as he had himself, as they all knew, been au ardent Reformer for the last 25 years, he trusted that the electors would believe that ho would not propose that gentleman if he were not certain to prove himself to be a thorough Reformer in the House of Commons. Mr. Cox was a man of the same stamp as Mr. Buncombe, and he ought, therefore, to bo put second on the poll, (Hear.) •TaV. a E'KJNSON, in seconding Mr. Uox’s nomination, said that many of tbo electors who were at first opposed to his return were now among his warm supporters. To what was tl»t change omng? (A. Voice.—" To 60 per cent, interest. ) To nothing but the conviction that he was au honest man. mJk* Tyler, amid some uproar, a cry of “Wat r ^d laughter, proposed Mr. Serjeant Parry as one of the most honourable men that were ever proposed at the Imsbuy hustings. (Cheors, groans, and hisses.) He believed that that learned gentleman had during his canvsssmg surpassed those who had been in tho field for months before him (hear, hear), and that several of those who had promised to vote for Mr. C!ox and Major Reed had desired to be released from their promises in orderthat they might bo free to vote for him. Ho regretted that for electioneering Purposes too vilest calumnies had been uttered against Mr. Serjeant Parry. ^ Mr. Savage (churchwarden of Islington), in seconding the nomination, said that Mr. Serjeant Parry deserved honour because he had manfully avowed that he wonld SaSjath*^0 11411100111 *“d ‘ho desecration of the 5Smw£aarsj sSnsss? to—-* nomination E'0ErNSON “conded tho gallant gentleman’s completod11^116^011 ^0UI cuud'dates having been tons Mr. Duncombe presented himself to the vast assembly, and was received with great enthusiasm. He said that they had learnt from what had just passed that there were four candidates in too field, and if all that had been said in their favour was no exaggeration (aud he did not mean to say that it was) he might safely aver that never had any constituency proposed to it gentlemen better qualified to represent it in Parliament, But, unfortunately, there was only room for two (laughter, and cries of “Shame!”); aud ho was therefore afraid that two would be disappointed. (Laughter.) Why should not Finsbury, as well as the city of London, send four members to Parliament? The city of London had only 120,000 inhabitants and between 14,000 and 16,000 voters, while Finsbury had a population exceeding 300,000, and upwards of 20,000 voters. Ho trusted that all personalities would bo avoided daring tho contest, for they were unnecessary and unworthy of the cause of reform. (Cheers.) He only wished that they could have had a stand-up fight between Tories and Liberals, but every one of the candidates was a Reformer. If toe electors thought that their interests would bo host represented by two legal gentlemen, let them send those gentlemsh to Parliament. If they preferred a little gunpowder to a little law, then let toe gallant major have a seat in toe House of Commons (laughter and cheers); but if they preferred an old tried friend, who had boon accessible to them on all occasions for the last 23years, during wMch they had rotumedhim six times to Parliament, whatever might ho his faults—and they knew that he was not guilty of the crime of having betrayed them, and that he never hesitated to fulfil the promises on which they first elected him (cheers),—let them elect such a man at all -

Serjeant Parry was received with great enthusiasm by the vast majority of the assembly. He said that he was prepared to contest the borough on those principles of political reform to. which he had been sincerely attached all his lire, and to which ho had rendered some humble service, (Cheers and groans.) He was a stanch advocate of progfessivo improvement in everything relating to the social weltbeing of England. He would vote with his hen. friend to.

But ho would ■earnestly press upon him that if ho wished to be Fnme Minister of this country and at the head of a Liberal Government he must promote liberal measures. He was in favour of the widest possible ■extension of the franchise and of short Parliaments. (Hear hear.) He was for the abolition of Jewish disabilities and ■church-rates. He would support Mr. Heywood’s motion tor the removal of tests at our Universities and grammarschools.

There ,d been a great agitation in this country about opening places of amusement on the day of rest. (Cheers and yells.) He was smcerely convinced that the only way to secure the flay of rest to the working-classes was to hedge and fence it with religious associations. (Cheers and uproar.) He would therefore not vote for the opening ot the British Museum, •&o., on Sunday. It had been falsely asserted that he had signed a petition in favour of Sunday opening. (“ The man that witnessed your signature is on the platform.”) He did mot . wish to see the English Sunday become like that of Hans, where the shops were open, and labour was carried on to as great extent as on any of the other days of the week, whereby many were deprived of their day of rest. (Cheers and yells.) This contest had been carried on in an extraordinary manner.. (“ By you.”) They had been told by Mr. AOX that a requisition, signed by onwards of 2.000 electors, had been presented to him, calling on him to stand for Fins’ ‘>UP’-,Ncm;> he (Mr. Serjeant Parry) believed that Mr, Cox had himself hawked about that requisition from house to house, mid that, instead of its being a requisition from the electors to Mr. Cox, it was one from Mr. Cox to Mr. Cox. (Cheers, laughter, and a cry of “ He has been hawking it about for the last nine months”) Slanders had been resorted to against him (Mr. Serjeant Pany) as was usual by parties on the losing side. He believed that Mr. Cox was convinced that ho (to. Cox) would not have the slightest chance. (Cheers and hooting.) His opponents had miscalculated when they thought to put down a man like himself by calumny. Be had been charged with being a Socialist, sdthongh ho had years ago with his pen and tongue opposed ^oialism as a <felusum and a mockery. (Cheers.) It was said that he had signed a petition for the opening of the British Museum and the National Gallery on Sundays, but he had never signed any such petition. (Cheers and hikes.) I hat assertion had been investigated by his committee, and they found that it was a slander. It had also been said that he had been deserted by Mr. Roger Cunliffe and by Mr. T>ler, but Mr. Tyfer had that day proposed him, and Mr. Roger Cunhffe would be one of the first to vote for him toth® P«Hing-booth. His hon. and gallant oppomeut (Major Reed) had asked the constituency why they should send a lawyer to the House of Commons, but who were so great law reformers as the lawyers themselves ?

Opening after winch-if nothing interesting tobisTonstlj tuents, or the people, like the majority of tho best mem- i J*rs, he would not return, hut he had never been absent ! trom an important division. As a means of estimating the merits of a member of Parliament, nothing could be more fallacious than merely to count the divisions. If it were a good test the best member would bo some junior Lord of the some gentleman who hoped to be a junior Lord of theTreasury, and who,having the feacofto.Hayter before his eyes, took pnxxous good care never to be absent from a division. He had constantly been in the library when divisions were called on some private Bill, and, although to be present would only have cost a walk of ten yards, he had disdained so cheap « source of popularity, (Cheers.) He could not think that 50 votes upon insignificant subjects were to bo compared with a single vote upon an important question. He tad also been told that his not having personally canvassed the electors since the dissolutiou had given offence; bnt ha know that they were too intelligen4 to expect to be called on like fine ladies, and that they would regard the idea of his being wanting in personal respect as perfectly ridiculous. (Cheers.) With regard to the question with which the dissolution was immediately connected ho thought that the debate on Mr. Cobwn s resolution, instead of turning on broad considerations of State policy, had degenerated into a mere legal squabble. AH the lawyers in tho House seemed to feel that they were bound to talk about international law, municipal law, and colonial law until he was sick of tho very sound of the word law. It reminded him of some lines which were written when Lord Eldon was Lord Chancellor:— u Mister Leach “Made a speech, “ Impressive, clear, and wrong; ** Ulster Hart, ** On t’other part, ‘ * Was tedious, dull, and long. “ Mister Parker “ Made that darker “ Which waa d*rk enough without; “Mister Bell “ Spoke so well, “ The Chancellor said—* T doubt.’ ” (Laughter.) > They had only to change those names for the names of living lawyers, and they had an exact description of that weary debate. As to the House being in the position of jury men nothing could be more dissimilar than the duties of jurymen and the duties of members of the Legislature. A juryman was bound upon oath to say aye or no to a given question, without considering the result of his verdict, but a member of the House of Commons ought not to give any vote without fully considering all the consequences which might flow from it. Acting upon that view of his duty, he thought the tendency of Mr. Cobden’s motion likely to endanger the reputation of England in the East, and, although he did not approve aU the proceedings of the British authorities in China, he determined to support the Government. (Cheers.) The issue put to the countary was whether they would send men to Parliament who were P&lmerstonians or antbFalmerstonians. He was neither, and to a certain extent he was both. In common with the great bulk of his fellow-countrymen he felt grateful to Lord Palmerston for having taken the helm when feebler spirits shrank from the task, for having restored the courage and the hopes of England, for having, by adequate wax preparations, secured an honourable peace, and for having discovered the intrigues of Russia and prevented that grasping Power snatching from us the fruits of our hard-earned success. (Cheers.) In place of Lord Palmerston what Government could they take? The Peelites were an army of general officers without rank and file, and, although very clever, had shown themselves lamentably deficient in clearness of judgment and strength of will. The followers of Lord JLterby were worthy men individually, but as a body were always in the wrong, or only right when it was too late. They had arrived at the conclusion that free trade was desirable, but they still cling to their old notions, and declared they wvald stand by the constitution, which meant the abuses of the constitution. (Cheers.) They stopped the way of that progressive reform on which England had entered and was determined to proceed. (Cheers.) These were good reasons for preferring Lord Palmerston to either of those parties. But he was bound, notwithstanding his gratitude, to express his doubts whether Lord Palmerston were friendly to progressive reform, and to use an Irishism, “ I foUow no Minister in standing still,” PersonaUy he had a grudge against the noble lord for bis. want of open dealing and fait play in never giving a day for the further progress of the BiH for the Abolition of Church-rates. It was, however, his conviction that in the next Parliament he should succeed in carrying that BUL The result of the elections would probably show a diminution of the Tory party. The mere Whigs would remain nearly the same; ancl there would be a large accession of independent members, whose opinions would be more In unison with those of the people. With the last he was prepared to act, for he held himself as belonging to no party, except the party of the Tower Hamlets. (Cheers.) He was for the ballot, for shortening the duration of Parliaments, for an extension of the suffrage: and it should not be forgotten that by the Compound Householders BiH a greater extension of the suffrage had been obtained through his means than by any other measure since the Reform BiH. He was also the honest and devoted friend (A Voice.—“Of Maynooth”) of tho utmost developement of civil and religious Uberty. In conclusion, the bon. baronet said that tbe momenfc he felt that he could not discharge the duty of their representative satisfactorily to his own conscience he would restore the trust into their hands and retire into private life, over which their long and generous confidence would shed more lustre than any earthly honour which he could receive. (Cheers.) Mr. Butler was scarcely able to obtain a hearing, notwithstanding that Mr.. Ayrton twice appealed to the crowd on his behalf, . He said it was now five years since he was called from retirement to do battle for a great principle— that a large constituency should be represented by a resident. (AVoice.—“Resident members areno good.”) He was elected by an overwhelming majority, and he defied any one to say that he had not served them faithfuHy. He did not fear the result of the contest, but he wanted to know why the peace of the Tower Hamlets was to he disturbed. His political views and those of Sir W, Clay were in close approximation to Mr, Ayrton’s. The electors had had experience of the past, but they knew nothing of the future. They only knew that promises were to be given, but as a boy he heard that promises, like piecrust, were sometimes made to be broken. Bid Mr. Ayrton come forward against the hon. baronet ? Then he said Sir W, Clay had served them 24 years. Bid Mr. Ayrton come forward against himself? Then he said he had lived in their borough 40 years. (Cheers.) He had always voted for the emancipation of their Jewish fellow-citizens, for the baUot, and for retrenchment, Could anybody do more ? His doors had always been open to every elector, whether high or low, rich or poor. Would they be able to go to Mr. Ayrton’s House, in Hyde-park-gardens, however ready Mr. Ayrton might be to see them ? Let Mr. Ayrton live among them, let him subscribe largely to tbeir charities, let him perform gratuitous local duties, and then let them do for Mr. Ayrton as they had done for him—return him triumphantly to Parliament. Some persons objected to him because he would not puU down the church and chapels and support the five points of the charter. Ho one could be more sincerely anxious for reform than he was, but he was not for revolution in the garb of reform. Let them reform the army and navy. Let them obtain protection for the honest voter. Let them retrench expenditure and endeavour to procure measures of progress in the cause of civil and religious liberty. (Cheers.) It .was not true that he had not attended to their interests. His mornings were spent in the Tower Hamlets and his evenings in the House of Commons. It was true that he did not rush in upon every peddling question to sweH the division list, but in the last ParHament he had voted in 353 divisions. He was bound to say that Sir WiHiam Clay was one of the most assiduous members, and he had found in him a kind and valuable colleague and a warm-hearted friend. He entreated them to believe that he never had and never would neglect their interests, and should he nob be returned, though bo did not doubt of . success, he should retire into private life with the conviction that he had diligently and honestly performed his duty to the constituency and to the country. (Cheers.) Mr. Ayrton was received with repeated shouts of approval. He said he was there to give effect to the discontent of the electors, which had been increasing from tho time of the last election to the present day. He waited to see the men of the Tower Hamlets give expression to the indignant feelings which possessed them at the conduct of their representatives, and he came forward only when he saw that the peace of the borough must be disturbed. He found the signs of discontent everywhere, and more especiaUy in the absence of Mr, Morley, who took an active part in the last ©lection. The electors had a right to be discontented with tho state of the representation, and he was there, on behalf of thousands of them, to arraign the late members for their conduct during the last five years. They had not dared to challenge inquiry by rendering an account of their stewardship at a public meeting of the electors. He was not there to oppose either one candidate or the other. It was immaterial to him which was elected with him. Bis business was to get elected himself. (Laughter.) It was for them to judge which of . the two. other candidates was the least worthy of again receiving their confidence. He did not come there, offering like Mr. Butler, to buy their suffrages with money. (Cries of “ Shame,” and “ False.”) It was, to his mind, a most indecent thing for any man to advert to his personal benevolence as a claim upon an inteHigonb constituency. Mr, Butler protested that this view of his remarks was most unfair and untrue. Mr. Ayrton was glad to hear it for the sake of Mr. Butler, because it put upon the electors an insult which they did not deserve. {Cheers.) He was there to arraign the late members upon a document prefaced by tho name of a man whom the people honoured, though he was sneered at in high places—Mr. Roebuck. (Cheers.) That name was followed by another not less honourable—the name of Samuel Morley. Mr. Tyssen said Mr. Ayrton was misrepresenting Mr. Morley, as would be seen by the letter he held in his h&ud. Mr. Ayrton took the letter from Mr. Tyssen and read it. It was addressed to Mr. Butlers— “I•wroteto Mr. Ayrton Jast^vening, informing him that it was not my intention to take any part in the present election. I feel it to be due to you to assure you that I hare nothing to do with any proposed opposition, and certainly bare nerer, by word or deed, authorized the Btatement to which you retee. If myvotea&given it Hill be given for yourself and Sir W. Clay.” Mr. Ayrton proceeded to say he had no patience with men who, like Mr. Morley, endeavoured to explain away by a note a printed manifesto to which had put their names. He would not have such a note weigh against a public document issued by the Administcatfoe Reform Association, and bearing Mr. Motley’s name. That document said the cause of the people was lost for want of strong earnest men in Parliament who would never give way to the Government, of the day when they knew they were right, and it recited instances of motions which would have had other results If the electors had returned members of that stamp. The second on /the list was Mr. Roebuck's motion for the Sebastopol Ccgniqlttee. Both the members for the Tower Hamlets were absent on that occasion. When Mr. Roebuck brought before ffluuse the fruits in- ■
quiry, and asked for sentence on those who had done wrong, bne oftheir members was absent and the other voted against . • ^hen a motion was made for a committee to inquire into the medical department of the two services one was absent and the other was for it. The member who voted was Sir \V, Clay. When amotion of serious earnestness was made, by Mr. Bayard—that the House viewed with deep and increasing concern the state of the nation, merit and efficiency being sacrificed to party and family influence —he could not find even one member present to represent them. When the question of reducing the bishops* retiring pensions from 6,000h a-year to 4,500?. a-year was raised and a division called one member voted for it, and the other, not having the manly courage to be present, sneaked from the House of Commons. (Cheers, and cries af * -Name the man who voted.) To his honour, it was Mr. Butler who voted. He liked the man who, if he had an opinion, would come forward and express it, but of all men ne esteemed least the man who when he ought to be present was always absent, and was only present when it served the purpose of the Government of the day. (Cheers.) Such was the evidence, not of neglect, but of systematic dereliction of duty on tbe-part of tbeir representatives upon occasions when the best interests of the electors demanded that it should be iaUhfully and energetically discharged. The ternponzmg Government of Lord Aberdeen treated the Tower Hamlets with acorn and contempt, in tho Reform Bill which they introduced. They proposed to give three members to several towns not exceeding 90.000 inhabitants, but the Tower Hamlets, with its 500,000 inhabitants, they left with only two. Yet neither of their representatives wised his voice against such a monstrous injustice. ( Shame 1 ) He protested against taking up any cry whatever,? connexion with the solemn subject of religion. Ee would not hound on men with the cry of “Ho Maynooth.” He would not raise the cry of “ Ho church-rates,” He disapproved, pledges being extorted on any angle measure, and promised to dispose of** such questions in. conformity with the principles which he had avowed. In conclusion the non. gentleman exhorted his friends to exertion, and expressed the utmost confidence in the result of the polL Mr. Child called for a show of hands for Sir W. Clay. It may bo that 50 hands were held np, but they were so few ttiat it was suggested they should ba counted. Porto. Butler the number was a little in excess. For Mr. Ayrton the great mass of tho persons present, amounting to some thonrands, indicated their decided preference. The returning officer declared the choice to have failed on Mr. Ayrton and Mr. Butler. The friends of Sir Clay demanded a PjdL which was fixed for to-day; and after a vote of thanks to to. Child tho assembly was adjourned to Monday at 1 o’clock. RETURN OF LOBE PALMERSTON. TIVERTON. The nomination of candidates for the representation of the borough of Tiverton took place yesterday, and resulted in the unopposed return of the former members, Lord Palmerston and Mr. Heathcoat. At one period, since tho announcement of the dissolution, there seemed to he every probability that the electors would have an opportunity of recording their votes. Sir J. Heron Maxwell, a Scotch baronet, entered the field upon Conservative and Protestant principles, and in his address to the electors he appeared to aim rather at the seal of Lord Palmerston than at that of Mr. Heathcoat. During a visit which he paid to tho borough he somewhat changed his tactics, and, provided he could have ousted Mr. Heathcoat, ho would not have objected to the Premier as his colleague. Rut the Conservative element in tho constituency is so inconsiderable, and the personal popularity and influence of Lord Palmerston and Mr, Heathcoat so great, that his attempt upon either of the seats was perfectly hopeless, and he exercised a wise discretion in withdrawing his claim at the earliest possible moment. On Thursday there was a report abroad that to. Brontcrre O’Brien, a noted Chartist leader, had come down from London to heard Lord Palmerston on the hustings, and airaign, in the face of the people of Tiverton, his whole foreign and domestic policy, Mr, O’Brien was actually in tho town, for he harangued a meeting of the working classes on Thursday evening;bnthedidnotpresenthimself (weknowaotforwhat reason—perhaps he dreaded the fate ot Mr. Rowcliffo) at tho nomination yesterday, which was consequently not so amusingas it might otherwise have been. Lord Palmerston arrived in Tiverton late on Thursday evening. There was a great crowd waiting to receive him at the railway-station, by whom he was warmly welcomed, and who followed him. cheering, to his hotel. He addressed a few words to his friends from an open window, thanking them for the cordial reception they had given to him, and requesting them all to meet him at the hustings on the morrow. The hustings were erected near tho church, and by 11 o’clock yesterday morning, the hour fixed for the nomination, several hundred persons had assembled to witness the proceedings. Business was generally suspended, and a flag was flying here and there in tho town. The two candidates, accompanied by the members of their respective com" mlttees, proceeded in tho first instance to the roTOjhaU’ where to. Samuel Gath, tha Mayor °£ Tiverton, who is also returning officer, read the writ and the Acts against Bribery. An adjournment then took place to the hustings, where tho real business of the day was done. Shortly after the proceedings began Lady Balmerston arrived on the spot, and was received with three hearty cheers, which were repeated when her Ladyship took * seat at an open window opposite the hustings. . mayor, in opening the proceedings, observed that, in compliance with the wnt which he had received for the election of two burgesses to serve in the next Parliament, he had appointed that day for the performance of the duty. He -rusted that they would give each of the speakers a fuiL fair, and impartial hearing. (Cheers.) Mr. "W. H. Gamlen, in a long speech, nominated Mr, Heatucoat; and was seconded by Air, Hawke. Mr. E. Hole proposed Lord Palmerston, whose policy he defended; and the nomination was seconded by Mr. R. WEARE, who expressed the hope that the Government of the noble lord had in contemplation a large and comprehensive measure of reform. No other candidate being proposed, The Mayor declared Lord Palmerston and to. Heathf°at *o be duly elected—an announcement which was followed by repeated rounds of cheering. It.511!. Hbmhcoat thanked the electors for the honour they had done him, assured them that he would continue to follow in Parliament the same course which he had hitherto pursued, and stated that he hoped to be able to discharge his duties attached to the office of representative to their satisfaction. His brief speech was loudly cheered. Lord Palmerston, on coming forward to address the electors, was received with loud and prolonged cheering. He said,—Gentlemen, before I begin to thank yon for the honour you have done me I must beg another favour your hands, and that is that you will allow me to address you with my hat on. (Cheers and laughter.) I have two reasons for making that request—first, that I may ho your true representative, for I see that you all have your hats on (laughter); and, secondly, because I am sure you would not wish.that your representative should bo prevented by a bad cold ia his head from performing the duties imposed upon him. (Cheers.) I would now, gentlemen, in the first place, say a few words relative to the opponent who appeared the other day in the field. There is an old and very good maxim that we should say nothing hut good of the dead (a laugh); and not only upon that account, but in order to do justice to my own feelings, I am bound to say of my opponent that he behaved in a very handsome maimer when, finding he had no chance of success, ho determined not to put you or us to any further trouble. (Cheers.) He no doubt was misled by statements utterly without foundation, and he acted like a gentleman in withdrawing at tho earliest moment after he found his expectations deceived. (Cheers.) Now, gentlemen, I cannot sufficiently thank you for the honour which you have done me in renewing, upon the present occasion, that confidence which I have forso many years, and at such repeatedelectious, received at your hands; and I can assure you that that honour is in my opinion greatly enhanced by the circumstance that I find myself associated with my most respected colleague, to. Heathcoat (cheers),—a man who stands eminently high in tho esteem not merely of all who know Mm in the neighbourhood of his own residence, hut of all those who have come in contact with him in his public cana<ity. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, it is perfectly true, as toHole, whodid met he honour to propose me stated, that I did receive fromverylargeand influential communities proposals that I should stand as a candidate to represent them in the ensnmg Parliament. I felt, as you may believe, greatly gratified and flattered by that testimony of good will and approbation from communities so important and mflential; but my answer was that I was wedded to Tiverton (cheers), that I should not pronounce a divorce (laughter), and that I had no reason to thmk that my friends here wished to dispense with my future services. (Cheers.) Veil, gentlemen, the occasion upon whroh Ihave now the honour of addressing you is one which concerns not simply myself as an individual, wMoh concerns not merely the Government of wMoh I am a member, but which, in my opinion, involves a question of he highest national importance—no less a question than he honour, the dignity, the interests, and tho fair fame of England. (Cheers.) Tho nation is called upon to choose J r T, EllSll/0r thG futUr° barged with the conduct of its affairs; whether that Administration wMoh for Uio last two or three years has watched over the interests ot hecoimt ry, or an Administration to be formed out of those— I must again repeat tho expression, however it may have been objected to elsewhere-Mtherto discordant elements which, I care not whether by accident or design, found themselves united in the same lobby to pronounce a c«nsnrd upon tho existing Government. Combination has been de med, but concurrence is a matter of fact; for it did so hanpen that the leaders of different parties found themselves muted in support of the vote of censure upon the Government, and no man, I think, will venture to deny that they believed that the carrying of that resolution Would be followed by the resignation o£ the present Ministry and the formation of another. (Cheers.) Veil, gentlemen, we took a different course. Ve believed that the Administration of the day, whether it possessed or not the confidence of a majority of the House <Si Commons, did possess the confidence (ind good will of the
people of tho united kingdom. (Cheers.) That belief has been confirmed to me from a great variety of different quarter*. I have had tho honour of receiving addresses from a great number of large commercial and other towns— addresses signed, as those who presented them to mo laid, by men of all ranks, from tho Mghest to the lowest— by men of all parties—Conservatives and Vhigs, Tories and Radicals—expressing their regret and surprise at tha resolution wMch a majority of tho Honse of Commons had adopted, and expressing also their continued confidence in theAdministrationoftheday. (Cheers.) Those addresses farther, were not only Mghly gratifying to the Government’ out I think they did honour to the national feeling of the country (cheers), because they are a proof that party considerations and party distinctions were forgotten when a case arose in wMch tho interests of England were involved, and that the same noble spirit which actuated the people ofthi, country, and wMch obliterated all party differences during tho war ■ with Russia, and the same plain straight-forward, and practical good sens© wMch has always eminently distinguished tho inhabitants of tho united kingdom, led them all at once to see that the real question at issue was, whether the honour and the interests of England should be maintained, or whether they should bo sacrificed for tho purpose of transferring power from the hands of one set of men to those of another. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, the Administration of which I have the honour to ho the head was formed at a moment of great national difficulty. As far as I am concerned, I certainly, but a very short time before I was called upon by my Sovereign to form an Administration, had not the slightest idea that that task could over bo imposed np on me. There wercothers who hadat their backs great parties in the country. I stood comparatively alone, and therefore I had no reason to sup. pose that any combination of circumstances would occur which would lead me to be called upon to perform the duty wMchfell to my lot. I endeavoured to surround myself with men of the same opinion as my own,—with men upon whose integrity and ability I could count; and I must say, in justice to my colleagues, that, if success has attended our counsels, and if onr exertions have been crowned with results satisfactory to tho people of this country. I claim no exclusive merit for that; the merit is *u,4bs members of the Government, for all contributed to the utmost of their power in the different departments over wMch ther presided with an unanimity which could not bo exceeded, and which has not always been equalled, to tho performance of the services of the country to bnng the war to a successful issue and the peace to a satisfactory result. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, it is well known that, co-operating with onr gallant and noble allies—the French, the Sardinians, and the Turks,—we did succeed in bringing to a speedy conclusion that war with Russia which many when it began believed would last for several years, and that wo obtained for this country a peace which accomplished beyond the expectation of many the objects ter which the war had been undertaken. (Cheers.) Vhen that peace came to he carried into execution we stood firmly by tha rights which tho treaty had given ns, and we did not permit any equivocations or stratagems to deprivons of some of the most important stipulations which the treaty contained. (Great cheering.) Gentlemen, it has been laxd to my charge especially that the policy which I have pursued has been a “Crbulent and igressive pqhoy. Why, if the policy which led to the war ^1"“ America was “ turbulent and aggressive,” I know not the meaning of those words; but 1 think that if it did deserve to be so described, the blame must bo shared by all partita in public and political life, and by the whole of tho twft'AVi0'1 ■k®’ (Cheers.) During the many long years tnat it foil tomy lot to conduct the foreign relations of this country we escaped war altogether. We, no doubt, had mmiy difficulties to encounter. Many questions arose out of which war might have come, but out of which war did not come. Ve maintained the intereste and the honour of the country, and wo succeeded m preserving peace. (Choers.) Gentlemen, we did no small service during that period of time to the nroiress of civilization and of civil liberty in Europe. (Cheers.) Ve proceeded in establishing tho independence of Belgium with a free constitution. (Cheers.) Ve assisted the people of bpam and the people of Portugal in establishing free Parliamentary government in those two countries. (Cheers.) Yet, forsooth, we are to be told that we are the friends and the champions of despotism, and that we are adverse to the adoption ot free and constitutional principles. Vhy, GenSemen, we wish to bo at peace with aU tho great Rowers of Europe, whether tbeir form of government be despotioaL monarchical, or constitutional. Those are questions which concern the people of the respective States. That winch concerns ns—that which concerns you—is, that, whether they be free or enslaved, they shall bo on j”,8 „ y telations with this country ; that our commercial intercourse shall not be interrupted, but shall be as free with respect to .tariffs as the prejudices of those different nations may permit. (Cneers.) Veil, gentlemen, then came this Churn question. Vhilel do ample justice to the Opposition Wien X say that they behaved daring the whole ox tne war, with Russia in accordance with the feelings and the spirit of tho country-it would be unjust if I were not to make that admission,—I must at the same time state that in the beginning of the late session a change came over the spirit of meur dream, and, from some cause or other, hopes and expectations appeared to be entertained that upon some question, no matter what, tho Government might be pnt in a minority, and power transferred to other brads. It was first supposed that wo meant to persist m retammg the “ war ninepenoe” of the m- come-tax duty. Disappoinment followed that expectation. That question dipped from their hands. Other points were then thought likely to afford an opportunity of a^politicaltriumph. One after another failed. Then came this outbreak in China, and it, most unfortunately for ,l4,npi J?5 "topted *s a patty question, upon which the strength of the different sections in the Honse of Commons might be fried. Veil, gentlemen, what was that question? Vhy, unexpectedly by tho Government at home, independently of any orders from them, not in consequence ic ac. * collision took place between our officers, civil and naval, in China, and that insolent bartwnan Yeh, who unites in his person all tha obstmaCT.ril the cruelty, and all the perfidy, that ever were collected in ono single man. (Cheers and laughter.) He began, after long-continued insult and violation of treaty engagements, by an outrageous attack upon the British flag. It was the duty of our officers on the spot to resent that attack, to require apology for the past, and assurance of abstinent for tho future. (Cheers.) They were unable te obtain those concessions from tho Chinese Commisfiiouer* ”© nave beard a great deal of technical argument »bout registers, colonial ordinances, and imperial taws, but the question was a broad and simple one. Here was a vessel with the British flag flying, with a British repster given to it, with a British subject—a man from Belfast in command. Sho was violently assaulted by a Lbmese force; all her crew were taken away, with the exception of two whom the Chinese, in compliance with tho request of tho British master, left to take charge ot tho vessel: and the only pretence was, not that any sue of tho men who were seized had committed any offence, but that one old man was the father ot a son who in some other part of China was believed to bo a pirate. (Great laughter and cheers.) Then it was said—an unworthy quibble—that when the Chinese boarded the Arrow there were no British subjects on board. Tree, because tho J61”8- °n th? P°int of sailing for Hongkong, was w *n°ituer™r?ssel only 50 yards from tho Arrow, hot before the Chinese left the lorcha he went on board, and it was specially at his entreaty that two men v«Ll r. ■ ,were left *0 take charge of the ii, I4m?? therefore totally preposterous to contend Sb\8eje, dl'i ,Dot know that tbe vessel was British. It had been lying off Canton for a week or FU days as a Bntish vessel, and it was distinctly and dellboa 8 Bntish vessel that they boarded it and took away the crew. Veil, gentlemen, this was an outrage and a violation of treaty engagements, and what did our TWMAd° ‘ r,They ^>?®an b? reprisals. They took a junk, xne Lhmese Commsssioner snapped his fingers at them and said Yon think yon_ have got a Government vessel; notnmg ot the kind; it is only a merchant one. and I don’t care a sixpence about it.” (A laugh.) Our officers, therefore, were obliged to take further measnrg. They began by disarming some of the batteries on the river. Step by step they proceeded, giving an interra! after each successive step to afford tbe Commissioner an opportunity of doing that ■which he ought in reason and m justice to have done; and, notwithstanding all that has been said about the cruelty of our proceedings, I say that never were the rights of a nation enforced with more torbearanco and abstinence from unnecessary violence than they were by _ Sir Michael Seymour—a man well known for hnmamtv, for moderation, and for being utterly incapable of abusing by exercise the powers with winch he happened te be intrusted. (Cheers.) Veil, gentlemen, we have been told that officers abroad ought not to involve this country in war without distinct orders from home, and that Government ought not to act without first appealing to Parliament and the people. Vhy, gentlemen, will any man tell me that officers at the other extremity of the globe, when a violent outrage is committed, are to remain with their nanos folded until they can send home for orders and have received instructions? Months would elapse between the insult and tho resentment, and the purposes for which redress is demanded would be utterly defeated by the apathy and want of exertion during that long interval* (Cheers.) Suppose a case similar to that which did happen, ana was the cause of the former war. Suppose that the Lbmese had taken a dozen British merchants and threatened to starve them « they did not do something which they had no right to bo called upon to do. Was our Admiral—was onLi Superintendent—to leave these men in prison until they could write home th© news to England and askwhether they should take steps to relieve them? Why. before tho orders of the Government reached China these men would have ceased te exist, and the answer of the Commissioner to onr agents would be,—“I am sorry to inform you that three months ago these men died from their sufferings m prison.” (Cheers.) This, gentlemen, is the dqotnne of those who contend that officers in distant situations ought not to vindicate onr rights without wevioualy referring home for instructions. Again, gentlemeii’ with respect te the authority of Government to undertake operations, no doubt if Parliament is sitting a communication is made to Parliament, while, if Parliament is not sitting and the question is adequate. Parliament shonld be called together, in order te be made acquainted with the circumstances that have occurred. BWj. “ the firet place, this cannot he properly called a war with China. Ve are not yet at war with China, as far as lre.,.ara.iawi?8- Y e do not know that tho acts of the local authority, Commissioner Yeh, have been adopted by the Imperial Government; on the contrary, we have been informed by the latest accounts that at tbe other four pprts-at Shanghai at Ningpo, at Foo-chow-foo, and at Amoy—the authorities have said that this local col’ Jision at'Cantq©.should not intermpt the good nnderstand'.T*iQh.h^sPuerto existed between them and pur mer- ; •, . ■
e bants at those ports, and that there is no reason why onr commercial relations should be at all disturbed, (Cheers.) Ve therefore do not yet know that the Chinese Govem, ment have made this a case ot war. Ve hope that they are too well*informed both as to tho nature of the violence committed and as to the dangerous results S’ ,Clun8 wllich would flow from a conflict with England te convert it into a national quarrel. (Cheers.) Veil, gentlemen, we are told that wo have adopted in substance the resolution of the Honse of Commons, that we have superseded Sir John Bo wring by determining to send out Lord Elgin to China. No such thing. It is perfectly natural, and in accordance with the general practice m cases of importance and difficulty, that, although you have an agent on the spot, in whom you place confidence, and whose conduct you may approve, yet, to give greater weight to your negotiations, you send out some officer of Mgh rank, charged with the verbal and direct instructions of the Ministry, who acts with more power because he comes from the centre of the Government at home, who goes out for a temporary purpose, who does not supersede the local agent, but who is more likely from the circumstances I have mentioned to accomplish the peaceful objects which his mission was intended teserve. (Cheers.) Thatisthe case of Lord Elgin. It is exactly in point with the mission of Lord J. Rnsscll to Vienna, which did not supersede Lord Vestmorland, our Munster there; and with tho mission of Lord Clarendon to Paris, wMoh did not supersede Lord Cowley, our Ambassador at that Court. (Hear, hoar.) Veil, gentlemen, I think it was a most unfortunate determination on the part ot those who supported to. Cobden’s motion to make it a question between parties and Administration. I entirely believe that to. Cobden gave his notice without any previous communication with other persons; but when his motion was announced—when tbe words of it were Placed on the votes of tha House of Commons, before the debate came on, no man who chose to exercise his judgment conld have made a mistake as to tho effect ot the resolution, if earned; and I am surprised that some men well versed in Parliamentary law, well knowing the effect of Parliamentary decisions, should have allowed themselves to behove that ttiejr wore only acting the part of jurymen, whoso duty was to decide upon a fact which had taken place at the other end of the globe, and that the result of the vote was not to have any practical effect upon our domestic affairs. (Cheers.) Vhy, gentlemen, if ttio House of Commons was sitting as a jury upon Sir John ofajury proceeding to try a man 18,000 miles off (choers), without his having the slightest tha4 he put upon his trial, and without havmg had an opportunity of instructing counsel to defend Mm 1 (Renewed cheering.) I say, gentlemen, that such proceedings might recall to onr recollection the secret tri4^e ages, but they have notMng in common with the practice of the British constitution. (Cheers.) But I am bound to behove that there were some men of Liberal opinions and belonging to tho Liberal party who honestly mistook the nature and effect of the vote they were glVtog, and who, not meaning in any way to withdraw their general confidence from the Government, voted nevertheless for a resolution tho intention of wMch was to tom out the Government. I have already said that the motion was ill-chosen. It is perfectly fair in the conflict of political parties for any set of men, however mnch they may formerly have differed, if ther can agree upon a course of policy for the future, to take advantage of every legitimate opportunity that presente itself to dislodge their rivals and to place themselves on the seats of power. I do not call in question their right to do that. It is in accordance with onr political constitutl8n\ They are bound, however, so far to have communicated with each other as to know that there will be no obstacle to the formatlon of a Government in lieu of that which they wish to turn out; and if they do see their way to make an efficient Administration, what then is the fairand proper course to pursue? They should propose to the House of Commons a vote of no confidence to the Government of the day, and they shonld fairly ask the country to choose between the one party and the other. (Cheers.) But I say it is not_ fair—it is not in accordance with the spirit ot the British constitution—it is not in accordance with the feelings ot the British nation—to take as a trial of strength a question in wMch ono party is to be arrayed m hostility to the honour, the interests, and the dignity of the country, and the other u called npon to maintain that honour, to watch over those interests, and to sustain that digmty. Snch was the nature ot the question on wMch the late division took place. The resolution was that the proceedings in China were unjustifiable, and therefore, as we dad. approved them, our course was unjustifiable, and wo ought no longer to wield the authority ot tho State. The voice of the people of England immediately rose against that decision, and against the principles on which it was fomded. It went like an electric spark from one end of the land to the other. It was not the result of any intrigues on the part of the Government, bnt trom the moment that decision was known, and the grounds upon which it was pronounced were examined, the whole of the people of England, without distinction of party, indigently repudiated the resolution of tho majority in the Honse of Commons, and said that the subject which had been chosen was not a fit peg upon wMoh to hang a motion tbe bands m which power was to bo placed. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, what must have been the necessary consequence of that vote if tho party who joined in it had succeeded to office, and it their condnot had been consistent with then- vote? Vhy, it tho course of Sir John Bo wring and Sir Michael Seymour was unjustifiable, tee Government that came in must have apologized te Yeh for the unjustifiable course of our officers: they m j a I?ve PJ?® bim compensation for the batteries and forts which onr gallant sailors had destroyed: Ik7.pT5 h*5 pa7 bim for all the exposes which his resistance_has incurred; and what, then. TL’J'TT deS»Mtog and humiliating position of this country? (Cheers.) Ve shonld have been acquiescing to a violation of our national and treaty rights, we shonld have been humbly sneing forgiveness from a man who has offered rewards for the heads of our fellow-countrymen, who has obtained the murder of many of them already, who has inculcated kidnapping for the nnrpose assassination, who has published an edict telling the Chinese that he has taken secret meaIThZ^\ Pmuth extonnmation of onr hated race. (Cheers.) Vhat he means by those “ secret measures” may be judged from the fact that he compelled an unfortunate Chinese baker to poison the bread which was te bo eaten by the whole European community of Hongkong; a diabolical attempt which nothing but the merciful interference of Providence conld have frustrated, and marvellous was it iudeed that nothing worse than illness occurred, and that the whole of these doomed Europeans were not swept off in one smgle day. Vhy, gentlemen, I say that ijf the new Government h»d earned cmt the policy recommended in the resolution it would have been hurled from power by an indignant people, and consigned to perpetual infamy for a course of which no honest or honourable man could approve (Cheers.) But we are told that they would not have carried out the policy of the resolution. Ve are told that the war having begun they would have continued it. If that indeed be so, what becomes of the political consistency of men who one day affirm a resolution the object of wMch £ to condemn a policy and to subvert the Government bv ™.m4h,a4 P?Ucy bas been approved, and who tell you the next, without any hesitation, that if they had succeeded and been called to office they would not have acted upon their own opinions, but have adopted a policy which they had pronounced to bo unjustifiable, but which they would7have continued simply because they found it in oporaSjSv* fCbeets.) Gentlemen, this day and to-morrow will be days on which a large portion of the people of this land will pronounce their verdictujiou the quesrionwMoh we deemed it onr duty to submit to them. You have pronounce your verdict, and the accounts which wo receive from all parts of the country lead ns, without hesitation, to believe that the electors of England generally will pronounced a verdict in accordance with that which has dono honour to yourselves. (Cheers.) But, gentlemen, wo hava been asked by many what is to be our future policy, and what arethegroundsuponwhichtheGovermnentrecommendsitself Now, I have told you in respect to our foreign relations wUat onr course has been, and such as it has teen such it will continue to be. Peace with all nations, as far as peace can bo maintained without disparagement to tho dignity and honour of the country, and without any diminution of the lights of England, either in the aggregate or in the persons otonr fellow-countrymen who are residing in foreign lands. (Cheers.) With respect to onrdomestio policy there are many of you here, and many elsewhere, who expect from the Government distinct pledges upon tho question of reform Now, those who know what is the position of a man in office, but more especiaUy what is the position ot the head of the Government, must see and feel that I should te acting a very unbecoming part if I were to conduct myself as a young candidate appearing for the first time on tho hustings, endeavouring by clap-trap pledges to enlist stray vote^ and going headlong at anything wMch any one or two people might teU him would be a means of msnnng the majority he was striving to obtain. It is the dntyqf the Government to look to tho interests of the country at large. Any Government worthy of tho position must feel that no nation can stand still; that England is not China; that the people of England are not te continue to be precisely in tho same situation with respect to their institutions from year to year and from century to century. Ve are a progressive PeS?;eGand therefore progressive improvements in aU onr institutions must be adopted, and must bo the guiding principle of every Government that wishes to maintain itself in the confidence and affections of the jieople. (Cheers.) I beuevo onr institutions to be in the main better than those of any other country on the face of the globe, without a tingle exception. I do not say on that account that they cannot te improved. AU human institutions must necesSanfr bo imperfect. Ours in all their branches *re> no doubt, susceptible of amelioration; and tho Govemnicut that shut its eyes te facts and circumstances, and wished to maintain things in aU respects as they are, simply because they are, would bo a Government upon which the lessons of experience and the reasonings of men would bo utterly thrown away. (Cheers.) But X am sore you would feel that it would bo unbecoming in me to enter into detailed pledges, or hold out. distinct promises njxm any of those points in wMch many of you must take an interest. It would not be my duty to do so, however I may disappoint the expectations of some whom I am now addressing; and the duty of silence like other duties, I shaU feel it imperatively necessary te perform. (Cheers.) Now, gentlemen, economy, no doubt is a matter deeply interesting to tho people ot this country TheGovernment that launchedinte lavish expenditure without adequate necessity would not te deserving of tho confidence and would not receive the support either of Parliament or of the people. (Cheers.) Ent there are great interests which must be guarded. Vo do not, like continental countries, maintain.largo military and naval establishments m times of peace; but we ought to have for the security of tho country the foundation upon which armaments may bo created to times of danger. (Cheers.) Onr army and our navy, though small in times of peace, shonld then be so organized, and more especially in regard to *11 their branches in which science and education enter, that we shonld be able, when the country is threatened with danger, rapidly to increase onr amount of force, and place ourselves in a situation of safety from attack. (Cheers.) That is the limit beyond which the present GoTem»?nt will not endeavour to go, Ve shall tn.
deavour to propose to Parliament such establishments as may bo sufficient for tho ordinal/ services of tho country during a time of peace, but which hy their may be capable of expansion when danger shaUanse; and more tepecUHy we feel it to be our dute to provide for the defence of those great navalanenalsb, ri^iwcked snc««f fqUy by an ensray-if destroyed by a hostile force—would deprive ns ©fall onr navilsupport, and would leave us open to any amount of fi— TasKm ,7 » fqe who possessed a better mllitarwforoe. (Cheers.) Such, gentlemen, are the principles npom. 5?l<2. conduct th© government of the counterw© think that those principles will meet with the tupporfc. of the people of England, and of the Parliament whichttu^ people may. return. (Cheers.) Vhenever out policy ceases to be in accordance with the feelings and opinion* offthe popple of England we expect their confidence tobe withdrawn. Pew, I think, will share tho apprehension entertained by Hr. Cobden of tho establishment of a dictatotsMp. Mr. Cobden welfr knows that no Government can exist which does, not enjoy the confidence ot Parliament and the people; and he and you know that if the approbation and report op the people were withdrawn from ns, wMoh I hope they will’ not be from any fault of ours, those voloes which have-, confirmed us in office upon the present occasion would ' "H*1 not in vain to transfer power towortMer hands. The people, therefore, need not entertain the apprehension that in continuing us in office they ?f8. placing power out of their own command,’ becausef,81f T?lc<?i?T4 h? *f de018i*« when raised against ns as I trort it wiU be at the present time when raised for ns. (Cheers.) It maybe enough for the people te determine:whether there were in the ranks of our opponents elements’out of which a sufficient Administration could te formed. Ibis of course more convenient for a Government to havem IT??011 i4> ^ l,moo4Il« ‘b» P»th. through a session; bat I do not me n to say that it is not in •coordance with the constitution of this country that there* shonld be out of office and opposed to office a body ot men comprising within their ranks elements out of wMchanother Administration could te formed, capable of commanding: the respect, and, if they acted properly, the confidence or the people. I doubt whether those ©lemonts at. present exist. I am led to doubt whether there is nofcmqre foundation than was at first supposed for the disclaimere we have recently heard of coalition and combina4T" j-SR “Ugh.) I am inclined to donbt whether there arenot differences among those who united 3n a recent occasion (cheers)—differences which lie deeper than, the turfaco, and which would prevent that com*Duration, in office which has been exhibited in. opposition. (Cheers.) It will be for future events toshow in what degree that may be the case. In the mcan^ j”",1?11 Ty ratam yonmy most sincere and hcarlfelfcvK^!i TtTT whl°b yon have conferred upon mothis day, and I trust I am not overstepping the trnthwhen.

(Lon* cheers.) Gentlemen, I return yon my warmest thanks, and. (G™tZelg.Jety degr6° 01 happiness and prosperity.

(Great uproar, arising from the antagonism of the two hon. gentlemen.) Mr. Parker, cotton-spinner, seconded the nomination, amid so much uproar and interruption that scarcely a word ha said could be heard. Mr. George Head Head, banker, who was sufferingfrom, a severe cold,_ and left the hustings in consequents! of Ms indisposition immediately on the conclusion of thedate he had undertaken) proposed Mr. Villiam Nicholson Hodgson as a fit and proper person to represent the constituency of Carlisle to Parliament—a gentleman to whom it would notte necessary for him (Mr. Head), like theotberproposors and seconders had felt it expedient to do in.

There is no darkness here—unpacked meetings (cheers)—reporters are present. (Cheers.)We meet friends and adversaries here face to face, and that fair play which is tho most precious jewel in the eyes of every assembly of Englishmen is hero sacred. (Load cheers. V Gentlemen, again I say I like this market-place. It remindsme of many battles fought and won in former times. (Hear,, hoar.) It reminds me of tho passing of the Reform Bill*. (Cheers.) These walls remind me of municipal reform. It is no longer a closa corporation, self-elected, but here isassembled within these walls a body ot common councilmen and a body ot aldermen chosen by the ratepayers and responsible to tho people, (Hear, hear.) Here also wasfought the battle of civil and religions freedom. (Cheers.) I am only speaking of what I myself have witnessed* Hero was established that great principle wMoh was tho" tallying point of tho Liberal party, namely, that tbere. shonldte no civil exclusion on account of religious creed. (Hear, hear.) Hera also was fought the great battle of tree trade. Here was established the principle that all the necessaries of life shall te at the disposal of the people at tho lowest possible price. These battles were fought and won here, and again I say I like this market-place, (Cheers.) Well, gentlemen, we are met here on a great and solemn occasion. Her Majesty has stated that she appeals to herpeople to take the sense of the nation in a great crisis of public affairs; and sho has implored the blessing of DivineProvidence upon her people, and t hat they, in the choice of representatives, shall on this occasion send to her such members as may aid hoc in the maintenance ot the dignity and honour ot her crown and the peace and welfare of her people, (Cheers.). Now, you are assembled io-dqy for the performance of this import ant duty. For tho first time in my electioneering experience I see to-day no colours, no flags, no excitement of music and bands; but you are assembled like a deliberative body of men to exercise on a great occasion a solemn duty, and I rejoice in tho comparative stillness and propriety which reign on this occasion. (Chccrr.) It is worthy of freemen, and appears to me to be a great improvement on former practices. (Hear.) Now, gentlemen, if banners had teen allowed X shonld not have hesitated to appear again to-day under that old blue flag with which I have so often fought (choers. and mtemiption), and I shonld have inscribed upon my own banner the words “Peace, Retrenchment, ind. Ftetorm, which have been my watchwords on many former occasions, and to which I still adhere. (Cheers.). Now, one word upon the subject of peaco. I conceive it to te the first duty of Englishmen, to defensive war at Mast, to uphold the honour of their country and of that flag which waves triumphant over every sea. (Cheers.) But though I am an advocate ot defensive war X can conceive nogreater calamity befalling mankind than the evils incidental to an unjust war commenced on insufficient grounds. (Hear, hear.) Now, gentlemen, I will not trouble you with, a long dissertation upon tho Chinese war. (Cries of “ ThoCrimea! the Crimea!’) Ihave a strong opinion—(Repeated, ones of .Crimea! Crimea!”) Gentlemen, 1 have a stream opinion that the Chinese war was undertaken on insufficient grounds. _ I believe the reason assigned was a mere pretext. il * 10 re^ltI bbat war is of an aggressive character— mat tne grounds on which it isproseonted are not defensible Md that it is unjustifiable. (Hear, hear.) Now, eentlemenr when I addressed you last, a few days ago, I did believe, r!i *tated *o, 8‘ mat time) there was reason to suspect mat that war had teen undertaken by orders from home ' Mnce I then addressed you there is strong additional rea*°n 101 supposing such to have teen the case, and it in, my firm conviction that this war was not accidental bnt was ordered from home.

Now, I do contend, xnen, that the war with China was wholly nnneces®a*y» and the war with Persia was waged, and was ca™®“ 0“ and closed in a manner utterly inconsistent "with the respect due to a popular representative assembly like the British House of Commons. (Cheers) — say incompatible with the respect due to the representatives °f the people and to the people themselves. (Hear, -and cheers.) Now, gentlemen, is this question of peace ■an insignificant matter to you? Yon hear a great deal ■wr * entot<K* into in the interest of commerce. Now, whafiftthe general meaning of that term ? "What is ■the meaning,of a war entered into for the interests of •commerce ? I will tell you what it means. It means, in mine^oases out of ten, a war commenced at the instance of nob British merchants with a view of making them richer—(“ Hear, hear,” and cheers)—while the cost of that ■war falls upon the poor and makes them still poorer. (Cheers.) That is the real interpretation and meaning of the phrase to which X have adverted. ‘Well, then, what is the consequence of this Chinese wax ? "What *s the object of that war? The teal object is to dru" the people of China with opium, and the effect of it here IS to enhance the price of tea. It tends to this not only i>y the inevitable increase in the cost of the article owin'' ■to the derangement and difficulty of importation, but stiff “ors oy the taxation necessary to maintain that war, and which still farther enhances that price and the price of ■sugar. (Cheers.) 'What is the effect, I ask again, of such » war ? It is an additional tax upon the the tea which is - consumed by every old wife in the kingdom (laughter), and upon every lollipop which is sucked by innocent and unsuspecting childhood. (Renewed laughter.) What is the class of people which I address that does not ■feel the effects of this taxation? I have told yon that jour tea is more heavily taxed and that your sugar is in "the same predicament. According to the Act passed in the year 1853 the income-tax ought to have been reduced *y the 1st of April next to 5d.; but, instead of that it has been found necessary to raise that tax, and to impose an additional 2d, upon all ir comes in consequence of the wars .in which we have been engaged and which we are now waging. (Hear.) War has many evils, but I know of none greater than the habit of wanton extravagance in the expenditure of public money which it introduces into Governments, and which has a tendency to debauch all Administrations. (Cheers.) Now, what has been the probable increase of expenditure since 1854? Actually the estimates produced for this, the second year of peace, indicate an in• crease of 6,000,00$.—(Mr. Hodgson.—“ Nearly seven”)— as compared with the expenditure of 1853. 4,000,000?. of that sum is sot down to the maintenance of the army and navy. I am clearly of opinion that the amount of the estimate for our standing army is larger than the necessity of the case requires. (“ Hear, hear," from Mr. Hodgson.) • hold that there ought to he a considerable reduction in that estimate. (Hear, hear.) But, apart from the navaland military expenditure, there is an increase in the estimates for the civil expenditure which is utterly unjustifiable. The amount of the increase in tho civil expenditure within the last four years (which cannot he connected with and ou»ht not to be affected by tho war) is 2,000,000k or more. I and ^ exPre83 my opinion freely upon this point— tlmt places—unnecessary places—have been created •toheers); that places have been created and intrusted to men that have an immense influence on the independence of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Privy Councillors have been added beyond the warrant of circumstances, a Minister of Public Works has been created, a Minister of Education, a Minister of Justice, and a Minister of Health, all with largo salaries attached to the position, and all immediately affecti58 the independence of Parliament. (“ Hear,” and cheers.) Well, then, I am no friend to centralization. (Hear.) I quite agree that self-government, as illustrated by our improved municipal institutions, is the basis and keystone of freedom. (Loud cheers.) Just consider for a moment. We have at this time a whole flight of locusts overspreading the ™d m the shape of inspectors. (Laughter and cheers.) We have prison inspectors, factory inspectors, inspectors of tho Poor Law, lunacy inspectors, inspectors of education, and coal mine inspectors. The list is so long that it would be tedious to enumerate them ; but all 1 those are highly salaried officials—all receiving nigh salaries while in place, and claiming compensation for past services when they retire. I say that this state of affairs is very much to bo traced to the prodigality incident to war. I say upon this head of retrenchment much is to be effected, and we have much reason to complain. See how it bears upon taxation. I have told yon what taxes have been proposed. Within the last fortnight I heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer treat with contempt a proposition which emanated from my friend Mr. Milner Gibson—for whose return for Manchester, in companywithmy friend Mr. Bright, I most heartily pray; but let that pass ; I heard, I say, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply to a proposition of my friend Mr. Gibson, assert that certain taxes Mr. Gibson complained of were perfect, and required no alteration. The first was the tax upon tho insurance from fire. Now, I conceive that there can be no more objectionable tax than *hat- It is a tax upon providence, thrift, and foresight. (Cheers). The Chancellor of the Exchequer said—it sounded like a conundrum, so difficult was it to explain_ that it was perfect, because the heavier the insurance tho lighter the tax, and the lighter the insurance the heavier the tax. What does that mean ? Why this, that the noh man, who insures largely and has immense capital, is taxed lightly, while the poor man who has a humble dwelling which he wishes to insure is more heavily taxed. Can there be anything more unjust ? (Hear, hear.) Yet we are told that the. necessities of the State are such, and that such is the importance of the war with China, such the importance or the war with Persia, that the question of fire insurances is not only not to bo regarded, but we are assured that it is a most desirable and perfect tax. Again, what is the other tax to which I have alluded ? It is the tax upon paper. This is a subject which has been repeatedly pressed upon the Government by my friend Mr. Gibson. What, then, is the tax upon paper ? It is threefold, and in every respect appears to mo equally objectionable. First, if we loot at the most humble dwelling, there we find that it covers the bare walls and adds to toe ■ comfort and the decency of the poor man’s house. That paper, be it remembered, however humble its quality, is taxed, an.) taxed heavily. In the next place, I apneal to the gentlemen below me connected with the press. The conductors of the broad sheet can tell you that the tax upon paper taxes all the information you receive daily and weekly in the shape of newspapers ; and, independently of newspapers, it is a tax upon tho literature of the country. It is a tax that bears directly and indirectly upon manufactures, and indeed everything is taxed more or less through the medium of paper. It is an additional tax upon sugar and tea and tobacco ; for there is not a person who goes into, a shop who asks for tea, sugar, or tobacco, and receives what he asks for in paper that is untried, so that through tho medium of that paper tho articles he purchases are increased 200 or 300 per cent, in price. It would bo useless to detain you longer upon the subject of retrenchment. A word upon other matters. I am of opinion that peaoo must be maintained to a degree consistent with the honour of this country. I know not it you will bear with me, if on the question of peace I read to yon what 1 hold to he the admirable expression of a right doctrine of peace and war, as set forth in the inaugural address delivered by Mr. President Buchanan in 1857 on the steps of the Senate Chamber in the great Capitol of Washington. These are the words I would wish to enforce upon the attention of all Prime Ministers of England, and which I believe to be no less applicable to ourselves than they are to onr brethren on the other side of the Atlantic. (Cheers.) Mr. Buchanan says:_“ We • ought to cultivate peace, commerce, and friendship with all nations, and this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material interests, but in a spirit of Christian benevolence towards our fellow men wherever their lot may be cast.. Our diplomacy should be direct and frank, neither seekingl.to obtain mote nor accepting less than is our due. We ought to cherish a sacred regard for -the independence of all nations, and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of any, unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of self-preservation. In short, we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit to all nations, and require justice from them In return.” (Cheers.) Now (resumed the right hen. baronet) I say that is the right doctrine, and is applicable to England as well as to the United States (hear)—that is the principle which, if I am honoured with your confidence—(an Elector—“If”)—I shall endeavour always in the House of Commons to enforce upon any Government, however it may be constituted. (Cheers). It is just, sound, and righteous, and Above all, it is conducive to the best interest of the community. (Cheers.) Now, gentlemen, I have said something upon peace and retrenchment. It only remains for me to address a few words to you on the subject ■ of reform. (Hear, hear.) I have observed with infinite satisfaction—and to-day, perhaps, more than on any former occasion—that on the part of electors and nonelectors, there is a disposition to hear and deliberate. Perfect sobriety and propriety of conduct seem to per-vadathe whole assembly, and X rejoice that in every part cf the united kingdom, and in Carlisle and this nei»b■fcourhood especially, the working-classes are inolined'to rational amusements ; that reading-rooms and libraries are resorted to more frequently; that greater intelligence is display™! a greater desire to learn, and a greater knowledge of •11 subjects that engross the attention of freemen (cheers)•nd I am satisfied that the time has arrived when the Bd for the extension of the franchise must be en1, and that a more general extension of the suffrage -—(A. Voice.—“Oily uammon.”follnwnH K«- j <The “ Friend.”—“ And you know'it.” (Laughter.)1 cure from his goodhumoured face he is a just man. (The
vJ'rie1d” »u Englishman.”) Will yon listen to me ? (The “ Friend,” persistent.—“ I am not a robber and murderer in the Crimea.”) The right hen. baronet broke off the colloquy and continued.—In 1854, hex ore there was any pressure upon this subject, when X was m the Administration, Lord John Russell and I introduced a measure into the House of Commons giving the franchise to occupiers of 10£.-houses in the county, reducing the privilege in towns to the municipal standard, which is dependent upon occupancy without reference to value. (Bear.) That is the measure we introduced, and that is the measure which on every fitting opportunity I shall endeavour to obtain. (Cheers.) It is vain to ask me to pledge myself to the support of any particular * * have nothing to ask at tne hands of any Minister—-I have no object to gain—-no interest to serve—no wish to obtain which has not reference to the welfare of the country. I ask nothing for myself, hut one thing I will do— whoever m ay be the Minister of the day, if he bnng forward measures in accordance with the principles and opinions I hold, and which I have given expression to this day, according to the means I have in my power he shall have my most cordial support. (Loud cheers.) If it be the pleasure of the representatives now returned to Parliament by the country to retain Lord Palmerston in office, I bow to their decision. From Lord Palmerston, as from any other Minister, X am ready to take any good measure he may tender j and if he fail to tender any, I will put pressure upon him, and endeavour to force him to do so. {(.beers.) It is said, “ You must keep out the Tories-thero is great danger tho Tories will be admitted.” "When, in 1852, the Tories were in place, I did all in my power to replace them by a Liberal Administration. Now, about the Tories, let me tell you a story. (A laugh.) I will take jou to tho House of Commons. "We sit there right and left of the Speaker. A Liberal Administration is in office ; they sit on the right hand ; a Tory Opposition sits on the loft. A motion was brought forward by the leader of the Opposition at the commencement of last session which I cordially supported, because it involved the question of expenditure to which I have beemefening, and the general object of that motion was to send back the estimates for revision by the Government. Notice was one evebing given of this motion. There was an old friend of mine, a Tory member, sitting on the left hand of the Speaker. I said to him this—“Now, I will put three boxes upon the table of the House of Commons, and will use the ballot as the means of voting, and I will write three names upon those boxes. Lord John Bussell, Lord Derby, and Lord Palmerston, one on each box, and I will bet you any money tbat, the ballot being confined to the Tory members, Lord Palmerston shall have an immense majority.” (A laugh.) Now, my old friend laughed, bub did not deny it, not in the least. That very motion to which I have referred in favour of economy only failed because a large number of his friends, the Tory members, voted against It and for Lord Palmerston. Then came the motion for Mr. Locke King’s Reform Bill. It was defeated by the whole body of the Opposition, all the Tories voting with Lord Palmerston against the Liberal party. And, again, with regard to this Chinese majority. It was a narrow majority. Why? Because 80 or 40 of the old Tories voted against th« motion and for Lord Palmerston. The truth of it is this—Lord Palmerston is, in my opinion, an old Tory of the deepest dye. (Laughter and cheers.) It is very well known that should he remain at the head of the Ministry he will introduce the minimum of reform which the maintenanceof his place requires, and the Tories will give him the maximum of support that decency will allow. (Laughter and cheers.) That is thy present state of affairs. To me it appears to be very delusive. I should not give any support to a Derby Administration were it to come in to-morrow, but I do not think anything could he so unsatisfactory as the Liberal party led by a high Tory. Again, I say it is not a sound state of affairs because a delusive one, as I said before. (Hear, hear.) I have detained you, perhaps, already too long. (Cries of “No, go on.”) But with regard to the present election, I can state that I have not solicited a single man for his vote, (Hear.) I have thrown myself without disguise ^ frankly upon the people of this town. I mqV for their support upon principles not concealed, but frankly stated. It rests with you whether I shall be returned to Parliament or not. I have taken no precaution with regard to another seat, I have relied upon you, and upon you exclusively, I have laboured long m the popular cause. The day with me is far spent. I have borne the labour and heat of that day. Tho eleventh hour is come. It is for you to say whether I shall labour one hour more or not. X might have wished to have read one more chapter in the political volume, c*n close the book without turning another leaf. (Cheers.) If it be your pleasure that I shall not sit in Parliament any more, I shall bow to your decision; at the same tune I shall never forget tho favours already bestowed \P°.^ ^e. (Cheers.) I shall bear no resentment. Gratitude shall be the only feeling of my heart towards you. lean only say, with a far better and a greater man than I—what Burke said when he lost his seat for Bristol on account of his opposition to the American war,—“ What is past is well secured ; it is beyond the reach of fortune. What is to come is in wiser and better hands than ours; and He in whose hands it is alone can say whether it is better for you and me that I should be in Parliament, or even in tho world.” (Cheers.) These were the words of Burke; these are the sentiments of my heart. I desire nothing at the hands of any Minister; I seek nothing at the hands of any man. If you send mo to Parliament X shall endeavour to give effect to the assurances I have given you to-day; if not, I shall retire into private life satisfied with my independent posi^l0D* But ^ not—if it be really your intention and wish to return me, let mo advise you to go to the poll early to-morrow, for early polling is safety to those you wish to see elected. Recollect, you are fond of wrestling. Let us have fair play; let us have no catches—no dog-falls. (Laughter.) If you are true to me I shall win, and once more I may wear the belt. (Loud cheers). Mr. J, Ferguson then essayed to address the crowd, but, in consequence of an ill-judged motion of one of his immediate supporters on the hustings for the hon. gentleman’s mends below to “ move up and close their ranks,” a scene of great confusion ensued. So great was the noise occasioned by the pushing and counter pushing throughout the whole ?“ . r8ns°'n,s address, that only those*who were close beside him could hear a word that was said. He gave an explanation of his political views. He approved Lord Palmerston as a Minis:er, but could not say he would always support him. * Mr. W. N. Hodgson next came forward, and wasreceived with much cheering by his friends. He referred to the different occasions on which Sir J. Graham and Mr. Ferguson had differed from each other in Parliament, and asked them to say what a spectacle the representation of Carlisle exhibited. He hoped they would rally round the flag of Old England and return him as one of their members. He thought it impossible long to withhold some measure of Parliamentary reform from tho people; but ho would not pledge himself to any particular course of action on that or any other question. The Mayor called for a show of hands. After this had been taken for eacli candidate, his worship declared his opinion to be that It was in favour of Sir James Graham and Mr. W. N. Hodgson. . The announcement was received with very general cheering. GREENWICH. The nomination of candidates for the representation of the borough of Greenwich took place yesterday morning in the presence of a numerous assembly of electors and non-electors. The hustings were erected in Church-street, Greenwich, opposite to tho open space at the end of Stockwell-street and were occupied by the returning officer, Mr. F. Chapl man, the several candidates, and their committees and prim cipal supporters. The proceedings were fixed to commence at 10 o’clock, and shortly before that hour the three candidates, Mr, M. Chambers, General Codrington, and Mr. Townsend, who were cheered by their friends and hooted by their opponents, as is the custom on such occasions appeared on the hustings. Mr. Alderman Salomons, who arrived from London about the same time, was received with very general cheering. At this time the crowd in front of the hustings was not a large one, but it afterwards considerably increased in numbers. There were no flags or banners, and, with the exception of some blue rosettes worn by a few of the friends of Mr. Townsend, no party badges were displayed. Punctually at 10 o’clock silence was proclaimed by the constable, and Mr. K. Chapman, the returning officer, having requested the meeting to give a fair hearing to every one who might address them, read the writ and took tho oath required to bo taken by returning officers. Mr. J. Laing, of Greenwich, proposed Mr. Montague Chambers, whom he described as a well-tried and faithful servant, as a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Parliament. 6 3;’ |)0:RF0LK’ °f Deptford, seconded the nomination. Mr. B. Duval, of Deptford, proposed, and Mr. Gkisbrooke, of Woolwich, seconded Lieutenant-General Codnngton. Mr. Laing proposed, and Mr, Norfolk seconded, Mr. Alderman Salomons. Mr. Jones, solicitor, proposed, and Mr. Murray, of Woolwich, seconded, Mr. John Townsend. Mr. M. Chambers, who was received with some cheering and many expressions of disapprobation, such as “ How would you like to have a cold dinner on Sunday ?” “ Who tried to rob a poor man of his beer?” &o., said that Parliament had been dissolved in order to ascertain the opinion of the people as to whether a vote which was given by the House of Commons was right or wrong, and as soon as the elections were over we should be able to ascertain which members of Parliament were right and which were wrong. He had voted, as ho believed, on the right side of the question. (Hoar, hear.) He had thus contributed to the dissolution of Parliament, and was quite willing to appear before his constituents and u*e 1? °Pluion as to his fidelity in discharge of the trust which they had reposed in him. Not one opinion had ho altered; not one principle had he violated since he was last beforothem. (A voice.—“ You have not often been in the J* it? ’ ^ That was false; he had attended very regularly; but there was much hard and valuable labour performed in vigilantly and carefully watching the granting and administration of the public funds, of which no record was to be found in the division lists. It was said that he had been fc frommany divisions on the ballot. He denied it. a 7 Bojteen absent more than on one, and had frequently voted for the ballot, the adoption of which he was still convxnced would be a moat valuable reform. What othercharga was there against him? All sorts of slanders had been circulated, but these he hadrefuted one hy one at the meetings of electors which he had had the honour of addressing. If he were asked what good he had done (cries of “ None,none”) he would, instead of stating what thousands of them knew, wait until the following day, and then receive from those who knew what services he had performed their approbation m the shape of their votes, (dear, hear.) He deprecated some allusions which had been made to Mr. Alfred Bristow, who was Ins true and hearty friend (hisses), and concluded by expressing the hope that the electors would exnress their approval of hu conduct during tha time that he had represented them by again returning him to Parliament. (Cheers.)! Sir W.,GBiDREtGTON was received with chests, and bnt a few expressions of disapprobation. He said that it was so shortta-tima since ho laejaapppatsd on those hustings that hassedsewcely repea^ts^-soiaratiou of his politick prin¬ , I
ciples. Most of them Lad heard from him that he was favourable to progressive reform and an advocsJfef civR and religious liberty, and he trusted that since he il*A been 1,1 ParliMnentthey had seen that he foilv carried out those principles. (Hear, hear.) It was upon the performance of those promises that he now rested his claim to their suffrages, Up to this time he believed that the liberal eause had been very well served by those who had represented Gre^wich hi the House of Commons. He had sat next to Mr. Chambers, and had received the greatest benefit from his assistance. (Groans and hisses.) Gentlemen might not like this, but it was the fact. He had profited Tby Mr. Chambers’s advice, and if he had represented Greenwich the borough had profited by it too. It was not necessary that he should refer to tne various political measures which were now under discussion. There was another candidate whom they were anxious to bear, and he would not therefore do more than thank them for the kind feeling which had been manifested towards him during his canvass and for the attention with which they had listened to him. (Cheers.) Mr. Alderman Salomons, who was received with loud and general cheering, said that he appeared there from a high feeling of duty, bnt at the same time under circumstances of great mortification. His duty arose from the fact that on two occasions he had been a candidate for the borougn, and on one he had the honour of being elected its representative. (Hear, hear.) He then thought it his duty to carry the flag of Greenwich on to tho floor of the House of Commons, and to defend at once his right and their privilege—his right .as an Englishman, under no disability, to become their member, and their privilege to elect any man who was not disabled by law from being their representative. (Hear, hear.) He appeared under circumstances of great mortification because, shame upon this great and free country, it was not certain that if elected he could sit in Parliament. (Cheers.) And why so? Because in the matter of worshipping God he in some respects differed from others of his fellow-citizens. It was under these circumstances that he came down there as an English gentleman to meet the electors of Greenwich face to face, and to tell them why he could not be their representative, although, under other circumstances he should be a most acceptable candidate. (Cheers.) While upon that subject he would say that which, perhaps, were he a candidate going to a poll he might not think it discreet to mention. He would congratulate them upon the aspect of this election (hear, hear); upon (the absence of colours, processions, and other sources of expense, which had greatly tended unfairly and falsely to injure the borough in the public estimation. No one was more interested in keeping down election expenses than were the electors and non-electors, for keeping down those expenses very considerably increased their power of choice. (Hear, hear.) Many very eligible men would be glad to represent such a district as that of Greenwich were they not deterred by rumours of the enormous expense which attended a contested election. As regarded the borough of Greenwich, he believed that, although it consisted of three towns, the population of which was spread over a very large district, the expense of an election in it was much smaller than iu Was, ^ aDY other metropolitan borough. In all those boroughs the expense was so great as to deter many able and proper men from becoming candidates for their representation. (Hear, hear.) No man ought io be elected for such a district as this unless there was something in his public and private character which gave the electors an assurance that he was a fit man to bo trusted with the support of their interests. At tho same tune they must not forget the sacrifices which were made by all public men. He was himself but a humble worker mthe service of tbe public, and had for many years enjoyed good health, but at the present moment Mr. Bright, Mr. Cobden, and the Solicitor-General, Mr, Stuart wortley, were all suffering from attacks of illness which were the results of their excessive desire to serve their country. The public, therefore, ought not to esteem lightly those men who devoted their time and their talents to maintain the rights of the people and to promote the honour and prosperity of the nation. One word as to why he (Mr. Salomons) did not on this occasion think it right to disturb the borough by being a candidate. A special appeal bad been made hy Her Majesty to the people that they should return to Parliament men who had their conhdence, in order that the business of the country might be successfully carried on. He would not enter upon the Chinese question, because, as he did not intend to go to a poll, his views upon that subject were not of importance. His object in coming before the electors that day was to say that he hoped they would remember that he was once their chosen representative (hear, hear), and would not forget that the reason he was not then a candidate was that did not see his way to a settlement of the Jewish disabilities question so clearly as to induce him to oppose those who had voted, and who, or their successors, woula,nehoped. again vote in favour of removing the obstacle which prevented his taking lus seat m tho House of Commons. The question as to whether he (Mr. Alderman Salomons) did rightly or wrongly in taking the oath of abjuration was still unsettled, but it stood first upon the list of cases on which ge judges were to give their opinions to the House of Lords. His address was drawn up with a view to hia being a candidate, but some of his friends at Greenwich, to whose opinions he felt disposed to defer, recommended that ho should not contest the borough on this occasion. He therefore cut off the head and tail of his address, and framed it to say that he should not, instead of that he should, become a candidate. One word more and he had done. The Jews really laboured under no statutable disability. They were now, and had for the last 10 years been, as free as any one wnqm he had the honour to address; but before taking his seat in the House of Commons—indeed, before taking any office whatever, every man had to take an oath, which was framed 150 years ago, when this kingdom was threatened with invasion by the son of James H,, and this oath was to be taken “ on the true faith of a Christian.” Every one who went into tbe House of Commons had to swear that neither the person calling himself James III. of England—a Kiugof whom they had probably never heard—or otherwise called James VIII. of Scotland, of whom he was sure they knew nothing, nor any of his descendants, had any right or title to the Throne. That mockery, that absurdity was to be swoni to “on tho true faith of a Christian, and although he swore to every word of it (a laugh), and swore on the Old Testament, he did not think it a gentlemanly thing to say that he did so “ on the true faith of a Christian,” and therefore he was chassSd and could not be their representative. He asked that crowded meeting, he asked the people of England, to protest against such an absurdity. Last year he was Lord Mayor of London and came upon the nver with all pomp, state, and majesty, but ho could, not be their humble representative. He had thought it. his duty to make these representations to them, and, thanking them for the attention with which they had heard him, he now wished them a very good day. (Loud cheers.) ' Mr. J, Townsend then came forward, and was received with much cheering. He said that ho was a stanch advocate of the ballot, without which he believed that the House of Commons would never be properly constituted, and a firm supporter of everything which would conduce to the welfare, the happiness, and the general prosperity of the community. (Hear, hear.) He was in favour of a very large extension of the suffrage, and would have church-rates abolished, and all religions supported by voluntary contributions. (Hear, hear.) He desired tb© total abolition of the income-tax, and would do all he could to take the burden of taxation from theshoulders of tradesmen and working people, and to place it on those of the rich. (Hear, hear.*) He was strongly in favour of the admission of Jews to Parliament, and so long as other endowments existed should support the continuance of the grant to Maynooth. A pledge was given that that grant should be continued, and he saw no reason why that pledge should be broken, .b rom having been bom and having lived in Greenwich, he must know the wants and wishes of its inhabitants much better than gentlemen who resided out of the borough, and he promised that if elected he would at all times be accessible to his constituents. He congratulated his fellow-townsmen upon the quietness and moderation with which this contest had hitherto been conducted, and expressed a hope that the same good feeling would continue to its close, when he confidently prophesied that he should be at the head of the poll. (Cheers.) . A show of hands was then taken, and was declared to be in favour of Mr. Alderman Salomons and Mr. Townsend A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Chambers and General Codnngton, and it was appointed to be held this day (Saturday), commencing at 8 o’clock. Mr. Alderman Salomons said that, notwithstanding the decision of tbe meeting, he should not go to » poll. Nevertheless, he thanked them for their kind demonstration, and when he could safely and fairly put himself forward for tho representation of the borough they might roly upon it that ^ would place himself at their service. A« be was in s harp-tog° to London to support that glorions champion of civil hherty, Lo d John Russell (cheers), he would only again tuank them for their kindness, and move a vote of thanks to the returning officer for the excellent manner in which he had that day discharged his duties. ufr- Townsend seconded the rote of thanks, which was earned by acclamation. Three cheers were then, at the instance of Mr. Alderman Salomons, given for Lord John Russell, and three more, bnt fainter ones, at the instance of some one else, for G eneral Codrington, and the proceedings terminated shortly after 11 o’clock. J The poll, as already stated, will take place to-day (Saturday), the only candidates for whom votes will be received being Mr. M. Chambers, General Codrington. and Mr. Townsend. KING’S LYNN. The nomination took place yesterday at the Guildhall, the Major (Mr. R. Cook) presiding as returning officer. The fine old hall was well filled, and the late members, Lord Stanley and Mr. J. H. Gurney,were loudly cheered on making their appearance on the platform. Mr. B. Bagge nominated Lord Stanley, and Mr. "W. Moyse seconded the nomination, Mr. P. "Wilson proposed Mr. J, H. Gurney, and MrW, Leppings (Deputy-Mayor) seconded the nomination. No other gentleman being proposed. The Mayor declared Lord Stanley and Mr. Gurney duly elected. Lord Stanley, who was received with loud cheers, said he had heard the present dissolution described by some speakers as a “penal” one, bnt he had not found it so. He did not venture to speak for others, but so far as he was concerned it was no penalty but a pleasure to him to meet his constituents. The first subject to which he wonld refer was that which was freshest in the minds of all present, and the immediate occasion of the dissolution—he meant that vote on the Chinese policy of tho Government which resulted in Ministers being left in a minority. On tha subject of that vote the most extraordinary and tho most reckless assertions had bean made that ever were uttered even by politicians going to. the country without a cay. A charge had been made of factions combination against tho Govern-' ment, bnt the opjy combination was theiweji.ef all politics and all shade-yffi opinion agreed independently in following the dictate eam judgmcp^agdJSXSsessing disap¬
proval of the policy pursued at Canton. Who' -ere the conspirators? Of Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Walpole, and Sir J.-Pakington he would say nothing, because it was one of the dutj«» of the *«det* of an organized Parliamentary Opposition trf avail themselves of any fair occasion to criticize the policy" of the Government. But when on that memorable Tnesda” evening he walked into the lebby with the majority, it seemed to him, after his eight years’ Parliamentary expelence, that he had never witnessed a division in which so grew a moral Md intellectual preponderance was exhibited rf-.fi0' w" John Russell, the man of the hrst Reform Bill, the historical representative of Liberalism, V ““ i>»u» would be linked with the history of 30 eventful years, and who wonld be remembered when w-TqjTx?,n®Wr,vikged him were forgotten. There ?raM13 Bavmg, a Liberal also, a man whom party spirit had never accusedof a single deviation from tho strictest principles of political honour. There was Mr. Gladstone, whose marvellous abilities had been rather hindered, so far as success in party conflict was concerned, by a TM^!f„Ul0n3 ?*, • passionate love of justice, .there was Mr. Cobden, a man from many might differ in regard to some of his opinions, bat who hesitated not to “ff J? 2“ » P°Pul»rity earned by his own exertions, and to stand forth alone, against the will of an entire people, wnen his conscientious convictions (call them right or wrong *S%xeX,W0’dd^ %n *? OPP08® the Russian war. There was with the majority also, if he might refer for a moment to the Dor<* Lyndhurst. who spoke not only with that weight which a perfect mastery of law conferred, not only with that power of argumentative eloquence which for 50 years had commanded the attention of which he had addressed, but who spoke also W!th that freedom which belonged to one whose age left him *?. fear> snd one who. being detached P.resent <*»?. could criticize those politics with the impartiality of one living in another cenin tahntd^° ,l,er,“rtr- , <5.hcer3-) He should not enter I d tho le=?l depute which took place with J°.utt^profeS?1.ng8 at c»uton, because the question of the alleged British vessel had really little or the ffuarrel which bad ensued, Lhe war with China was an unjust one, because we had picked a quarrel to enforce a claim in itself of very small ^ue and which, if it were enforced at all, we might prooably have secured by negotiations in common with other countries. _ (Hear, hear.) It was a cowardly war, because it Vf^a war in which the strength, military knowledge, and skill of the two parties were so unequally matched that a battle was notthat manlike trial of strength between equal forces which took place when European nations met one another, but a mere butchery and a mere shambles. The war with China was also an impolitic one, even admitting that that which was unjust could be expedient in the long run, which he did not believe, because part of the cost must necessarily be paid in tbe increased price to the consumer of one of the few luxuries of the poor man. It was impolitic, because, our object being to secure more general and &ca. “^Icmrso with China, the Chinese people must differ very much from the rest of the world if attacking their forts and bombarding their towns was the way to bring about that communication. (Laughter.) The war was an impolitic one, because the object of an enlarged intercourse with China must necessarily and certainly have been attained in the peaceful progress ^of trade. In his belief the Chinese war was commercially, politically, and diplomatically a blunder and mistake. (An Elector.—“ It is nothing of the kind.”) He raid nothing bnt what ho believed to be the truth, and as ho had not spoken upon the subject in Parliament, he would before leaving the question do what ho considered an act of justice. He thought the public had been rather fa™ upon Sir John Bowring. He did not believe that Sir John Bownng wonld have taken the course he pursued and introduced the demand of right of entry into Canton, and been prepared to enforce it, unless some intimation had been conveyed to him that the Government would support him in what he was doing; and it was fair to the Government to say that they had transferred to themselves the responsibility of Sir John Bowring’s acts. With regard to foreign policy, be wished to see England always strong and muted for defence, but he had no wish to see her armed and ready for aggression. With regard to Parliamentary Reform, be considered that some extension of the suffrage and some equalization of tho representation were necessary, bnt he had voted against Mr. Locke King’s recent motion, because he thought that the question of Parliamentary Reform ought to bo considered in its integrity, and not in a fragmentary manner. With reaard to the finances of the country he did not enterta'u. apprehension. There was a hopeful elasticity in British commerce, and the demand was increasing from India and the Australian colonies, which took half of our exports. As to the question what taxes should be abolished, the noble lord observed that it was impossible to give pledges long in advance, but he expressed himself opposed to the paper duty and the tax on insurances, and in favour of a revision of the tariff. With respect to the income-tax, he said he thought the country should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it in I860, ;and if it was then to cease, and some other tax must be found for it, the substitute, he thought, might bo an extended house-tax fairly laid, not on calculations of what houses let for, but on an estimate of their value. On the subject of economy in the public expenditure, all were for economy in the ahstract, but few in fact. A large standing army in time of peace would be a gigantic job—a godsend to the Secretary of the Treasury, and a dead loss to tho nation. He did not wish to leave the country defenceless, but he thought, on the whole, the standard maintained before tho late war would be a tolerably fair one in future, and that militia forces might he established in some of the colonies. The noble lord then expressed himself in favour of reform in the laws relating to the transfer of land; a system of criminal and judicial statistics, as in Franco ; the consolidation of the statute law ; a change in the ecclesiastical courts ; an improved system of testamentary jurisdiction ; a reform in the laws on marriage and divorce ; competitive examinations for the civil service; and the abolition of church-rates. He also called attention to the necessity of some measure on national education ; and, in conclusion, he declared that, reviewing his political career, ho could say that he had sought to do justice and feared to do wrong ; ho had no other end, and he had known no other fear. (His Lordship resumed his scat amid 1. nd cheering.) Mr. J. H. Gurney, who was also received with cheers, next addressed the electors. Thanks to the Mayor then closed tho proceedings. SHEFFIELD. The nomination took place yesterday in the Com-Exchange, in the presence of an assemblage of upwards of 20,000 people, Mr. J. W. P, Smith, the Mayor, presided. Mr. W. Fisher proposed, and Mr. R. Leader, jon., seconded Mr. J. A. Roebuck. Alderman H. E. Hoole proposed, and Mr. 6. WostenHOLM (the Master Cutler), seconded the nomination of Mr, George Hadfield. Mr. W. F. Dixon proposed, and Mr. E. Vickers seconded Mr. William Orerend, Q.C. Mr. Roebuck was received with loud and protracted cheering. He said—I am quite sure that every man here will give me a fair hearing, and I hope you will give everybody else a fair hearing. (Cheers.) Well, then, thereat business of this day will be your show of hands. Any speech I can make cannot reach one tenth part of the people I see before me. Therefore it would only he wasting my time and youis by attempting to address you. Gentlemen, I have not kept my opinions hidden under a bushel; you know what they are, and you do not wait until to-day to have them explained. (Hear, hear.) But I think you will allow me to state, which I will do very shortly, the true nature of this contest. It is not upon the Canton question you have to decide. (Cheers.) I’ll tell you what you have to decide. You have to decide between myself and my hen. friend, Mr. Hadfield, on one side, representing advance in government, and my hon. and learned friend on my right (oheeis and hooting), who is opposed to tbat, (Cheers.) Tbat is tbe real distinction between us. It is not whether Mr. Hadfield and I have Pr.e? 9ne wroDg vote—not a wrong vote in my opinion— but itis, are you to be fairly and faitnfollyrepresented in the coming House of Parliament? (“ We’d soon settle it if we could.”) I have no doubt if the suffrages were in bands of the persons I now see before me, the show or hands would determine what you would do. (Cheers.) But you know, gentlemen, that the suffrage is restricted—it js in a few hands at present. (“ But we are too many for him, though,”) (Cheers.) But stul I am confident that even with these few hands we shall be successful. (Cheers.) And I will tell you why. The few hands in which the suffrage is are Englishmen. (Cheers.) They will not discard and forget honest and long service ; they will not put aside tried men for an untried man. I have nothing to say against in j learned friend-for friend I shall call him, and in social life such I consider him ; but I and he, each forming our opinions, have come to an honest conclusion— he takes one side in politics, I take another. (Cheers.) I meet him fairly. Hear him, give him ©very liberty, and, when you have done so, decide between us. (Cheers.) He is a gentleman—I hope I am. (Cheers.) Treat him fairly yo!1 treat me, and—fairly beat him. (Loud cheers and laughter.) This I take to be the proper way to maintain our contest. Into it no personal rancour ought to enter. No allusion of a personal description ought to be indulged in, (Applause.) Political opinions are fair game. A public man—and he is now a public man—you have a right to discuss all his principles. (Cheers.) You have aright also to discuss the opinions of his friends; and I say to my hon. and learned friend that I believe him to be what he% was in 1852. He was then a Conservative—I believe him to be so now, (Cheers.) I see him surrounded by the same friends—(Mr. Overend.—“ And by many of yours also”)—but then, mind yon, Lord Derby was in power. I have lived to see great changes, and in no people greater changes than in the party to which my hon. and learned friend belongs. (“It’s wheel about and turn about wi em.”) (Laughter.) I think that is verv near an accurate statement. When I first entered political life, I loand them rabid against Catholic emancipation, vehement against Parliamentary reform ; I found them crying their lungs to pieces in favour of the corn laws and against free trade. (Cheers.) I have seen all these things carried in spite of them ; and now there are other things that we desire, which they in their hearts object to, and we will carry them in spite of them again. (Immense cheering.) "We think that we have not yet attained to anything like perfection. _Uurs is an onward course: change has no terror for us. ^ Vye donofc stick in the ancient ways because they are ancient. We we not Conservative, but Liberal. And depend upon it, if you send my learned friend to Parliament, tbat, though he may be a Palmeralonian on one question, he will be a Conservative on all else. (Cheers and hooting.) t . before him. I know what I say is true; and what I believe true I will say before him as I would say it behind his hack. (Cheers.) "We can afford to be honest p^yqilves)—very much mistaken in *®d laughter.) And de^nd upon it, tflatii hec-'^pj^sda^OT.toTOte for
lum to Parliament, you would be very mueh mifc 'akeq too. (Cheers and laughter.) Now, gentlemen. I will not occupy your time, for you are in an uncomfortable nation b^e ever been .friend of freedom (eheers)-religions ind Sr.E,I.i’tV“*11edeT-0I3'f?'S‘t chanE® and improvement that has taken place since^1 have been in public* life and every one of them that party (pointing to the ConK'rF^l1JeS) tss °5P?8®iv To that party I am and I believe I shall be to my dying day. (Chetvs-) Gentlemen, I throw myself with confidence agam ito, the people of Sheffield. I appeal to my life pan in the se ’■vme of my country, and I ask yon to re-elect me. (CbeersJ Mr. Had yield briefly addressed the electors. Mr. Overl’NB next addressed the electors.—Lord Palmerston has come, o take the sense oftbe country as to whetheror not you will snp1’wrt him in the conduct of a very necessary retu-ta my friend Mr. Roebuck and my friend ■Ur. Hadfield, yon vrAi paralyze hia hands and you will disgrace England. (Hooting and faint cheers.) I askmy friend Mr. Roebuck where are his old supporter ? Where are tho men who stood by hia side and who flocked round him when te weslMt here? (Hooting;) Where are the merchants of Sheffield? To a man they have deserted him for having abandoned Lord Palmerston in bis difficulty I am a Conservative. I believe every man honours the constitution of this country. Even Mr. Roebuck wonld not like to see it destroyed, and therefore b» is a Conservative with mo. I am as Liberal as Mr. Roebuck. (Hooting) I wonld advance with Mr. Roebuck. I would amend and improve the constitution. I wenld destroy nomination boroughs. I would give the suffrage to a great many towns which do not at present possess it. I am for universal freedom—religious, civil, and political. I am in favour, as strongly as any one can be, of educating tbe people. On the show of hands being taken there was an overwhelm mv majority in favour of Messrs. Roebuck and Hadfield, and a poll was demanded for Mr. Overend. . . AYLESBURY. The nomination took place yesterday morning with the usual formalities, the candidates being Sir Richard Bethell itdtaw°’r^rnnal) *?d ^Jard- tha lat® members, an“ Mr. T. T. Bernard, on the Conservative interest. Gibbs proposed, and Mr. Olitoe (Datchlands) seconded, the nomination of Sir R. BothelL Mr, ACTON Tindal proposed, and Mr. Z. Phillips seconded, the nomination of Mr. Layard. Mr^ Bemard.Pr0I>°SCd’ ^ ^aded, , ®KieHAKD BETIIELL, after bespeaking a quiet hearing for all the candidates, said,—You know that Parliament has been dissolved in order that two questions might be answered by the country at large. I. WiU you live nnder a Liberal Government, or under Tory domination ? I say the answer to that question will be one united cry_“ We will have a Liberal Government.” The next question is this— Will you return a sufficient majority of Liberal members to Jr&riiament to enable tho Government of the country to cany on, rapidly, certainly, and with confidence, the great measures of social improvement which are demanded by your condition ? I know you will answer Yes; that you will fulfil that pledge by tho manner in winch you will act to-morrow. (Cheers.) I regretted a vote that undoubtedly put in peril the existence of the Government, but I shall not regret it if it has the result of returning a Parliament ten times as strong and ten times as Liberal. Therefore, we are neither of us inconsistent; for if you do your duty you will have to thank Mr. Layard as well as me for enabling the country to return another Parliament more able to do good to the country than the last, owing to its sections and divisions, unfortunately could do. We come before you in the honest confidence of men who have endeavoured to do our duty You are in the habit of talking of civil and religious liberty. Now, there is not a greater opprobrium in this country than the condition of a most intelligent, industrious, andbenevolent race among ns—I mean the Jews. Many of you lire in the neighbourhood of excellent men belonging to that persuasion, ■who smart under tb© penal exclusion. Ask then, the gentleman who promises to protect your local in“° Tote *ortbe emancipation of the Jews1 Who will be the best champion of local interests? WiU it not be my hon. friend and myself, who have done all in our power tovnpe away this disgrace? But, gentlemen, remember there WiU be great things to be done in the next Parliament into winch we hope by youraid to find admission. I can represent them by the words “reform,” “retrenchment,” peace. Whether in or out of office, for office shaU never stand in tho way of my giving a conscientious vote, I hope to support measures that will greatly promote tho end of aU good government, the great object which it is tho bounden duty of aU rulers of this great country to promoteto the utmost of their power. These things are not to be done by featherbed members (cheers); they are to be accomplished by men of physical energy, trained to sit in the Dotfoof Commons (no pleasant atmosphere) from half-past 4 taU2o clock in the morning. I hope in the next Parliament to see great measures of permanent improvement, but don t thmk tbat these can be arrived at by a hop, sldo, and jump. I hope and trust, too, that the relations of this country with the great marts of commerce in the East wiU be placed on a more secure foundation. It is unnecessary to refer to the Chinee war, except to remind yon that war has often been the high road to commerce. I was sorry for my hon. friend’s vote on that question, but do you think Parliament would not suffer if my hon. friend, who has attained so much information of the affairs of the East, were wanting to its deliberation ? If he had given 10 votes which I disapproved, instead of one, I should feel it a subject of regret if the next Parliament had not the benefit of his intelligence and energy, Mr. Layard, who was most cordially received, said.— When five years ago you sent me to Parliament I told you J. was an inexperienced man, that absence from my country had prevented me from forming a judgment; bat I told you tbat my experience abroad had taught me that the more the rights of a people are respected the greater liberty they enjoy, the more secure is the Government, and the higher the position which that empire will hold in the world. I told yon, therefore, that, whatever my inexperience, you would always find me on the side of the liberties of the people. I trust that in my place in Parliament I have redeemed that promise—that my name has never been seen in an adverse vote to anything in which the liberties of the people are concerned. (Cheers.) You know that I have been more than once absent from j.nglaud during the time that I have been your representative. I mention it to illustrate the position I have held as your representative. Soon after you sent me to Parliament a great question arose—the preponderance of Russia in the wall say that journey was an idle one. (Cheers.) It was I who first urged the Government of the day to take measures of precaution, who pointed out the quarter whence danger was to be apprehended. The event verified every prediction to a tittle. (Cheers.) It was tha same when I urged on tho Government measures for the protection of the lives of those who were sent out. There was scarcely a point on which I did not indicate in the House of Commons the risk they were running by neglecting ordinary precautions. Again, I wished to see the army in the field. Iwas with it at Alma, at Inkermann. I was in the trenches with the army. (Loud cheers.) I wished to speak as a man who had seen the events he was describing. I told the House of Commons I had seen noble men, taken from the working classes of England, withstanding ten times their number at Inkermann, and then sacrificed te a false system, to a foolish egotism which the people of England would not tolerate. "When Lord Palmerston sent ??^ aQd Sir J. M’Neill I was again anxious that the country should he able to form a correct idea of what was going on. I have laboured in tho House of Commons to promote those questions connected with army and navy reform which I thought essential to the welfare of the country. (Cheers.) I hope in a short time that China will cease to boa household word, and we can’t bo shouting for seven years, which this Parliament may last, “ Hurrah for Palmerston and China!” (Cheers), Some ueople say we tamed the Government out for the sake of place. But place has been offered me, and I have refused it. You uttle know what I went through years ago, when I sacrificed friendship and all that was dearest to me, with only the consolation that the course I took was ratified and approved by the great body of tho English people; and that, not because X had not made mistakes, but because I have been sincere, energetic, truthful, in my endeavours to place tho administrative system of the country on a footing that should conduce to tha liberties of the people—which should place all men on a footing of equality before the law. (“ Hear, hear, and cheers.) (Mr. Layard sat down amid repeated cheers.) ^ Mr- Bernard then addressed the electors, claiming their suffrages as a Liberal Conservative—a party founded by Sir Robert Peelafter old Toryism was dead in 1832, and which had done more m the way of reform from 1841 to 1846 than had ever been done in the same period. Mr. Bernard expressed himself favourable to the admission of Jews to Parliament, but opposed to the ballot and the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. On a show ofjhauds being called for, an Immense majority appeared for Sir R. Bethell and Mr. Layard, very few being held up for the ronservative candidate. A poU was demanded, which will commence and close this day (Satar_ , STAMFORD. Tro election for this borough took place yesterday (Friday) at the Town-ball, the Mayor, Mr. Horden, presiding. rt being market-day, as well as a great annual pleasure fair, the attendance was but small. Mr. Phillips^ nominated, and'Mr. Handson seconded, Sir Frederic Thesiger. Lord Robert Cecil was nominated by Capvam Haycock, and seconded by Mr. Althorp. No other candidate appearing, tho Mayor declared the two hon. gentlemen duly elected. Sir Frederic Thesiger first returned thanks. After some introductory remarks, ho denied that the Conservative party were opposed to all reform, They felt that no human wisdom could make a system at enca so perfect and so valuable that it would adapt itself to- every change of time and circumstance. But tho reforms* whach they were ready to support and maintain weus. reforms, in tbe spirit of the constitution. They looked upon that constitution as an ancient and venerable fabric which sometimes might require repair* and sometimes eren. enlargement, to accommodate itself to the wants of its- owners. They ccsired that repair should bo to strengthen and not to impwrthe walls, and that if any enlargement took place it should bo upon thosofou*da'dons which were prepared by the original designers* and tb.at the superstructure should bo in unison and har-meny -with the rest of the edifice. (Cheers.) The. qju»fcaTj. of reform ia our representative system wcoM undoubtedly occupy at an early jeriod tho attention, r f the new Parliament, Whatever measure b s proposed, whether by Lord John Russell oxj by tho Prr me Minister, tbe Conservative party would b^-pund- s£ f neir posts. They would be ready to v u which was in the spirit of tho conEtitxygig; >ub <*ey would take care to defeat, as far as it themibfcwr any rah and ill-digested innovations would* j to destroy the balance of that constitution. (CHesav t of coarse, a subject which must necessarily floppy^tbelW i'y atentton of the CTnitogFarUamTnt wonld ibc tUe,skeait-0f oiw-sktifyis, with China; *nd if- tenanted

(Cheers.) >»ith regard to the question of church-rates, it would be E/’-Jusfc to deprive the church of that to which it had » right, and which it had so long enjoyed, unless some equivalent could be offered in lieu of it; and he thought tie church had a right te stand upon its own firm ground, aid to call upon those who were endeavouring to assail it in this respect to five it that which would bo a substitute r that of which it was deprived, and which it had enjoyed from time immemorial, (Hear, hear.) He bad always been strongly and consistently opposed to tbe admission of the ?*e ?ousea °* the Legislature. He had considered that the Legislature wow a Christian assembly, governing » ^-h'lstian people; and he could not believe that any one bat a Ghnstian had a right to- a seat in such an assembly, (i neers.) Thera were other questions, of course, of more gineral importance which must necessarily engage attention upon the assembling of Parliament. And one which would naturally interest all his hearers was the administration of our finances and' an economical ezpenoitare and a reduction of oir expenses to tho fullest JJ7’ possible. He confessed that he <Sd not seer tnat it would be possible, or even desirable, to rednoc very considerably the expenses ctour nwal and military establishments. (Hear, hear.) NV one, her thought, would desire to see them reduced to the- state of inefficiency m which they existed from 1840 to 1850. It would ber d> arable undoubtedly to maintain theseienowof the army to its fullest extent, because that wa&-not- the treation- of &• nay, but at the same time lo reduce i!n-nnmeri»l strength; (for men could bo trained and drilled in-a-voty short time)' to the lowest degree possible, in order to insure the perlormance of the duty which was necessary in tho-timo of" peace- (Hear, hear.) But, in looking in othepdircotions, hathought there were subjects which might require a littlewatchful attention on the part of their representatives, witn regard to the civil expenditure, it-appeared to* have insensibly grown to a very considerable amount; and ho found it represented that in what-were called the miscellaneous estimates there had been an- increase since 18o3 to the extent of 1,390/(XX. Now, that was-notiho fault of the Government. It seemed to have been a was-cfnl course adopted by the Parliament, which-- wonld require carefully checking and controlling, because it was only by a proper redaction of the expenditure of the country that we could hope ultimately to be relieved fromtbe pressure of the income-tax, which he still hoped-might come to an end in the promised year of 1860, (Cheers.)) Ihe Gonservativeparty would be quite prepared to give support to Lord Palmerston as long as he was pursuing a course which they considered for tbe benefit of the country. They would pionjote all necessary reforms in the amendmentamt simplification of the law—in the changes which were requisite in the constitution and practice of our ecclesiastical courts—in the law of divorce—in everything which tended to asast the voluntary efforts of the people to promotemoral and religious education, and, in a word, in everything which might tend to the social and religious advancement of the community. (Loud cheers.) Lord Robert Cecil in the course of his address urged the importance of attention being directed to the class- of subjects which were denominated “social reforms.” Thesewere comprised in such matters as the various branches of k gal reform, sanitary reform, educational reform, all thatconcerned actually and directly tho comfort and well-being *he bodUy and spiritual welfare of tha millions cony mittod to the oareof Parliament. Alluding te thequestion of the treatment of criminals, ho said that so lon«as those who were hopelessly incorrigible wer<* allowed to remain among ns, and to taint thesociety in which we lived, it was impossible that the law should be respected, or life and property be safe. (Hear, hoar.) Glancing next at the subject of education, the noble lord declared his opposition to any scheme which was not founded upon religion. He concluded with the assurance that, in all the matters which would bo brought before 1 arhament, he should be guided in giving his votes by the great Conservative principles which would secure to ns and our posterity the glorious inheritance of that constitution which onr ancestors sacrificed so much to set up and to hand down to us. (Loud cheers.) The proceedings closed with the usual vote of thanks to the Mayor. .... , MANCHESTER. At 10 0 clock yesterday the nomination took place at the hustings, on the usual site in front of St. Ann’s Church, ia St. Anus-squate. The friends of Messrs. Gibson and Bright took up a position on tho left facing the hustings. u Messrs. Potter and Turner occupied the n8jJ hand portion of the square. Tho windows and tops °f th0 houses on each side or tho square were crowded. sT'own-Clerk, punctually at 10 o’clock, proceeded to after which the usual oath was administered *°m?e iJaJor Mr. Maude, the stipendiary magistrate. The Mayor having briefly addressed the electors, ..^•Alderman Watkins proposed tho Right Hon. T. M. Gibson as a fit and proper candidate. (Cheering.) £l<*erman Mackie seconded the nomination. Mr. Bazlky proposed Mr. J, Bright. (Loud cheering.) Mr. A. Henry seconded tho nomination, Mr. Alderman Neild proposed, and Mr. T, FaiRBAIRNT seconded the nomination of Sir J. Potter. Entwisle proposed, and Mr. J, Pender seconded the nomination of Mr. J. A. Turner. The Right Hon. T. At. Gibson stepped to the front of the hustings, and was received with a deafening and prolonged cheer.—I appear before you to ask—(cheers and confusion) for a renewal of that confidence which for 15 years past you have reposed in me, (Loud cheers.) It has been, thought desirable by some gentlemen in this city to dGmi?s me from your service, in conjunction with my hon. colleague, John Bright (loud cheers, and cries of “No, never”): and, having looked about, two gentlemen have been found who are considered better fitted, in all respects, to represent vou In Parliament than your old members. Now, you. have to consider whether your old members have to be dismissed- whether there is a sufficient case for recording <v verdict against them at the present election. Have they betrayed the cause they were sent to Parliament to advocate ? (Loud cries of “ No, no.”) Judging from the views I have heard expressed by the supporters of Mr. Turner and Sir John Potter, they are not the friends of tha people. They are to go to Parliament as tho friends of tho Government. (“ Hear, hear,” and loud cheers.) We cannot pledge, if returned, to support the Government. (Hear.) Government men cannot be people’s men. (Loud cheers.) I shall always look back with pride to tbe honour ■which X have enjoyed in representing so great and intelligent a, constituency. I don’t look back with regret on anr vote (hear) or any opinions (hear, hoar) that I have recorded, (Loud cheers.) If returned, I must be and shall be where you have always found me, co-operating with the friends of progress, keeping myself independent of Government (loud cheers), and desirous of only one object—that is, the carrying out the principles I am sent to Parliament to promote* (Hear, hear.) Mr. Vaughan (brother-in-law of Mr. John Bright) then stepped to the front of the hustings, and said, —I appear before you as the humble representative of my friend John. Bright (loud cheers), and to declare that your member’s principles are unchanged and unchangeable. (Continued cheering.) There are great principles involved in this contest, and upon this contest, also, aepend material interests, The great material interests of this great constituency and of the country at large are involved in your decision. Tho people of England also look to you, because they say that your members were not simply the representatives of you (hear, hear), but they were the representatives of the great 5111* ?mP^r^an^ interests of the people at large, (Hear, hear.) Inoy are representative men of the ago, (Hear, hear.) Resist, with all your might, the combination—tho unprincipled combination of recreant Liberals (loud cheering)—of inconsistent Tories—(A Yoico.—“ Garnett dictation )—and Government dictation. Sir J. Potter (who was received with hissing, cheering, and confusion^ which lasted a considerable time, during which his opening remarks were inaudible) proceeded to observe,—Is there any reasonable probability that your late hon* member is likely, however much we may deplore it, to bo presented to the constituency of Manchester? Is it likely that ha willbe able to undertake the duties of this great constituency? Under such circumstances as these it cannot bo alleged, as. a matter of complaint against myself, that I come before my fellow-townsmen to fight their battle, and endeavour to rescue this constituency from tbe thraldom which, whatever may be said to the contrary, has been kmgfelt in Manches*er- It is said that I have deserted my friends. I wiU maintain that I have neither deserted my friends nor principles. It is said that Manchester ought not to bo represented by any one connected with Government, It is scarcely necessary forme to say that I seek yonr suffrages as a sincere reformer,—that I shall be prepared, if you think me worthy of your confidence, to support every measure of progress, and the improvement of the commercial, social* and intellectual people of Bngland generally, (Laughter* and confusion.) Mr. James ASRCfALii Turner, cm presenting himself, was greeted with much cheering from his friends and with tumultuous confusion and groans from tho other side, said,—If you elect me I will diligently perform my duty. If, on the contrary, you think your two late members maybe more eligible titan Six John Potter and myself, give them, your vote, and I, for one, will retire into>prlvate Ufe,with.perfeet good feeling and good will towards those who have-supported me,as-much as towards those who have opposed me*. N ©w, I know not that there are very essential differences in. my sentiments from these-held by your lato representatives, fihey are for reform. I am forreform, like them. I am a supporter of civil and religious liberty, Kke them; but, unlikethem, I wish this-country to maintain a firm attitude and hf r dignity in the face of the world. I ask, ie British trade* British commerce, and the property of British pooplo to b* sacrificed? (Great ooafurion.) Mr. Oobden’s motion was, I believe, a most disastrous one ; and so, I believe, the majority of the people of Manchester think. (Hear, hear.t Bat what I feel the strongest interest upon is tho domination which has been so long exercised by a few persons who assume all tb© powers, without tbe mom force, of the lata Anti-Ootn Law League, and that for political purposes. Several questions having been put to the candidates, The Mayor called for a show of hands, and, after con* suiting with Mr. Maude and the T©wn-Cleik, declared tha show of hands to bo in favour of Mr, Bright (loud applause! and Sir John Potter. WOLVERHAMPTON. The nomination of candidates took place yesterday a to*r “ Town-hall, nnder the presidency of the M (Mr. E. Parry), as returning officer, Mr- H. Walker proposed, and Mr. E. B. Du seconded the nomination of tho Right Hon. C. P, Villi Mr. G. Barker moved, and Mr. R. Bew seconded nomination of Mr. T. Thomely. There being no other candidate, The Mayor declared Messrs. VUliers and Thomelr elected, amid great cheering. The Right Hon. C. P. Villters, on presenting hii In front of tho huntings, was cordially received. He ref to his long connexion of 23 yearn with the borough, am he felt deeply sensible of the honour of being agafn d after suoh % long intercourse with it. After alludmg to local and personal matters, lie rapidly glanced at tbe permanent topics of the day. He was and had always a- Reformer, and ho had ►every confidence that Lord Pa]
*ton, -who had been a member of every Reform Government within the last 25 jews, would not disappoint the expectations of the country on that groat question. Lord Palmerston was certainly a favourite with the people; they were disposed to trust him; they thought he was a genuine Englishman; that he understood the genius and requirements of the nation, and was always ready to vindicate its honour abroad, or at home to yield to the reasonable representations that might be made to him on any subject. (Cheers.) Lord Palmerston was at that moment addressing bis constituents in Tiverton; he (Mr. Yilliers) did not know what he was saying (laughter), but they would have an opportunity of knowing it on the following morning—but he was certain that it would be found worthy of the First Minister of a great and a free people. (Cheers.) His Lordship might not join in the cuckoo cry of “ Peace, retrenchment, and reform,”—he (Mr. Villiers) did not want the sound, but the reality, and that he expected to get from Lord Palmerston. As to peace, he (Mr. Villiers) considered that it was the rule that never should be departed from, except to vindicate national honour or defend the interests of the nation. On the subject of reform he was equally clear. The exercise of the franchise by the people should also bo the rule, and only limited where its extension would bo dangerous not only to property, but intelligence. He was happy to say that there was not a roan now in power who had given utterance to a desire for limiting the possession of the suffrage by the people. The franchise was every year being more extensively diffused by the efforts of the people themselves, by their frugal and industrious habits, and the manner in which they exercised the privilege was highly creditable to thorn, and showed that there was no danger in investing the working classes with political power. (Cheers.) On retrenchment he would advocate the most stringent economy consistent with the defences of the country and the efficiency of the public service. After alluding to his votes on the Jewish Disabilities and the Sunday Trading Bills, he said he believed that England was upon the eve of being at peace with all the world, as the Chinese question would be soon settled in a manner not only satisfactory to ourselves, but to the Chinese and all countries trading with the people. He did not believe that we had done the Chinese any injustice ; they had violated their treaties with us. We would get them to respect these treaties, and the result would be beneficial to them and to ns. It was now admitted by all who addressed themselves impartially to the subject that the Admiral and the other authorities on the spot had no alternative then to act as they had done, consistently with the preservation, not only of national honour, but the lives and property of our fellow subjects. The right hon. gentleman concluded by saying that Lord Palmerston would make use of the return of peace by applying himself to carrying out many domestic reforms—army, legal, and administrative. (Cheers.) Mr. Thornely having also addressed the assembly, the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Mayor and three cheers for Villiers and Thomely. NOTTINGHAM. The poll opened at 8 o’clock yesterday (Friday) morning, and voting proceeded rather languidly during the day, though a good many polled. The Sheriff (Mr. i'olkin) had wisely ordered that the votes should be taken in the several wards, and not all together in temporary wooden buildings in the Market-place, as heretofore. Tho result was that the populace were split into sections, and much excitement was avoided. The following are the returns issued at the close, at 4 o’clock:— By Me. "Walter’s Committee. "Walter. 1,804 Paget . 2,365 Jones . — ... 696 By Me. Paget’s Committee. Paget . 2,389 "Walter . 1,819 Jones . 607 The Peace party joined then: exertions with tho Chartists, voting for Jones and Paget. If their second votes be taken from Mr. Paget’s majority, it will bo found that Messrs. Walter and Paget polled about an eqnal number of Liberal and Conservative electors. The result was announced from the Exchange window, amid much cheering ; after which, Mr. Walter thanked the electors, and congratulated himself and them upon the result. Mr. Paget was about to do the same, when a large body of Chartists came up, and, by hooting and yelling, put a stop_ to the proceedings, in spite of efforts made by tho sheriff and others to secure a hearing. The Chartists are deeply disappointed and enraged as a body, having fondly hoped that their nominee would he returned through tho influence of their allies, who, it is understood, have not only encouraged the opposition, but undertaken to nay Mr. Jones’s expenses. Close of the Poll. . 2,381 Walter . 1,819 Jones . 607 NEWARK. The nomination of candidates to represent the borough of Newark-upon-Trent in Parliament took place yesterday (Friday) morning, a temporaryhustings having been erected m front of the Town-ball. The candidates, both Liberal Conservatives and independent supporters of Government, were the Earl of Lincoln, eldest son of the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. John Handley, banker, of Newark. 1 The Earl of Lincoln was proposed by Mr. J. Gilstran and seconded by Mr. W. HalL Mr. John Handley was nominated by Dr. Beevor, and seconded by Mr. J. Brausten. No other candidate having been proposed, the Mayor (Mr. G. H. Riddell) declared the Earl of Lincoln and Mr Handley duly elected. TheEarlof Lincoln, on coming forward to return thanks, was received with repeated rounds of applause. He said he appeared before them without the designation of a party name, but he pledged himself to a true Liberal lino 0f policy, and to support the present Government so far as they proposed snob measures as he believed were calculated to serve the interests of the country. He eulogized Lord Palmerston for the services he had rendered to the country, especially in the carrying out of the war with Russia. He had been asked his opinion on the Chinese question, and, without saying anything about the policy which had originated the war, he did think that Lord Palmerston was right m supporting the acta of his Ministers abroad. (Cheers.) Coming to questions of domestic policy, he thought that, with a little pressure, the Premier would become as good a Reformer as any one could wish him to be. All he could say was, that if he disappointed his expectations ho would no longer support him. (Applause.) He was a strong advocate for economy in tho public expenditure; at the same tune he would give his support to the maintenance of those establishments which he thought necessary to the well-being of a great nation like England. Alter the experience gained by the Russian war, he inshed to have the army and navy maintained In a state of the greatest efficiency. He was favourable to a gradual extension of the franchise, and would open the constitution to all those who proved themselves fit for it by education and good order. He was no advocate for the ballot, but would cheerfully promote all measures which might be proP?6e<i te secure to every voter the free and unbiassed exercise of his electoral rights and effect the suppression of bribery. He would not consent to the abolition of churchrates until ample provision was made for the church of this kingdom. He was not in favour of the withdrawal of tho grant to Maynooth, as he considered it a part of the settlement of the Union; at the same time, he would yield to no one m his zeal as a Protestant, and as a sincere disciple of that church m which he had been brought up. He looked upon education as one of the great serial questions of the day, and would gladly support any measure for its extension, but he, for one, would not have it separated from religion. He sard he was a lover of the Sabbath, and would not see the day set apart for rest turned into one of riotous pleasurejeheem) ; and he did not think the opening of the Crystal Palace, and such places, would conduce to the happiness of the working classes. He did not forget, however, that Sunday was the only day of leisure for the labouring man, and he could not believe that harmless pleasures were at variance with Christian doctrine. (Aoplause.) 1 r Mr. Handley referred to some of the great events which had occurred during the existence of the late Parliament, and gave credit to the Government for the energy and skill with which, in a time of great difficulty, they had restored confidence, and brought about an honourable peace. He professed an ardent interest in the wide spread of education, and promised to render all the assistance in his power to reduce the public expenditure. He also pledged himself to a diligent attention to every matter which concerned the trading and other interests of the borough, and concluded by expressing his thanks for the high honour they had conferred upon him. The proceedings closed with the usual vote of thanks to tho Mayor. READING. The election of members for this borongh took place this day m the Guildhall of the borongh. The fact of an unoontested election, which has not occurred for some time past in this town, caused the attendance to be smaller than usual. The usual formularies having been gone through and the writ read the nomination of candidates was proceeded with. Mr. Salmon proposed tho nomination of Mr. Francis Pigott as a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Parliament. Mr. A. Exall seconded tho nomination of Mr. Pigott. Mr. J. B. Monck proposed Mr. Henry Singer Keating as a proper re preventative of the borough. The nomination of Mr. Keating was seconded by Mr. Alderman Darter. No other candidate having been proposed, the MIayoe declared Mr. Francis Pigott and Mr. Henry Singer Keating duly elected. 6 Mr. Pigott expressed his gratitude for the renewed confidence which they had placed in him, and appealed to his Parliamentary career during the ten years he had represented them as a proof of his having fulfilled tho pledges ho 8s™ in 1847. He announced himself as a Reformer, and he brireved he had been a constant upholder of those principles which were held by those men who fought under that great statesman, Mr. Fox. (Loud cheers.) Ho alluded to the peculiar composition of the late House of Commons, and riom the various changes of Government which he witnessed he believed what had been said was true—that it was a Homo m Commons which no Minister could manage. (Hear, hoar.) Ho then referred to the proceedings at Canton, and said he Believed thoso who voted for the Government and those who opposed it had both arrived at the same conclusion— that Lord Palmerston had taken the proper course In sendtb y representative of acknowledged ability to the Court of tll6y were involved in the war ho should give his hearty support to Lord Palmerston, believing that no one was more tenacious of the honour of his j (3j0tld cheers.) He hoped, after the jlnd«d-ei’Government would pursue* do,mestl° policy, and, while giving Lord Palmerston hts general support, he should not hesitate to k"?lf ha opposed any question which he (Mr. Prgott) believed was necessary for the promotion of'the Wi£*rSr*Ed prooporffiy of this country. (Applause.1 Mr. Keating also thanked the electors for re-electing him, and trusted that bis conduct in Pariiameathadn^f •with their approval, (Applause.) Ho spoke at considerable
length on the China question, condemning the proceedings ** 9*oton, winch he did not think were calculated to forward the honour of England. (Applause.) The Government ought to defend the conduct of their officials; hut there was a higher question to he looked at—that of right and wrong, and upon that ground he could not consoientioMly support the proceeding. He expressed himself ,s a general but independent supporter of Lord Palmerston’s Government, though he had always voted against him when it was necessary and in accordance with his conscientious convictions, and should continue to do so. (Hear, hear.) mteated * V°^° shanks to the Mayor the proceedings ter__ . "WALLINGFORD. Ihe nomination took place in the Cora-exchange' Testerday. In consequence of its being market-day, the proceedings did not commence until 2 o’clock, and were of great ‘“8™; not terminating till after B o’clock. The Mayor (Mr. i. E. Field), having taken the usual oath, proceeded to for the nomination of a candidate. Mr. "Wells proposed, and Mr. T. Dean seconded the nomination of Mr, Richard Malins. Mt.Beisley, farmer, proposed, and Mr. T. B. GREENWOOD seconded the nomination of Captain Sartoris, late of the 7th JtU3S8»TS. The candidates having addressed the electors, a show of Sartoris113 ^£en’ *nd de<dared to be in favour of Captain A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. M.lim,, KIDDERMINSTER. The nomination of candidates for this borough took place yesterday. The candidates were the Right Hon. R. Lowe, Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and Mr. "W. Boycott, an influential solicitor of this town, who opposed the re-eleotaon of Mr. Lowe on anti-Ministerial grounds. Mr. James Pabdoe proposed Mr. Lowe, and Mr. James Holmes seconded tho nomination. Mr. Boycott having been putin nomination, Mt.Lowe addressed themeeting. He flattered himself that after the canvass he had made and the meetings they had held he and the electors of the borough properlv understood each other. He meant to stand by them, and was convinced they meant to stand by him. (Great uproar.) One thing he was anxious to say, because as regarded everything else he could leave his character and public conduct in their hands with the utmost confidence. But there had been circulated among them a placard charging him with canvassing two constituencies at once—that while canvassing and addressing the electors of Kidderminster, he was also, by his friends and agents, canvassing the city of Manchester. He wished to make a declaration to them, on tho word of one who had never deceived them nor any one else, that he never, directly nor indirectly, by any communication whatever, authorized himself to be put up as a candidate for the representation of Manchester. (Cheers and uproar.) He was not insensible to the honour of oeing asked to represent, with a certain prospect of success, what he regarded as. perhaps, the first constituency in England in point of intelligence and numbers. He was extremely gratified^ by the honour, but be remembered his first friends, and wished to grow where he had been planted. He desired to perform the pledge he had repeatedly given, that he would stand by them as long as they stood by him. After bis refusal the gentlemen of Manchester telegraphed to him, asking whether, if they elected him without his coming down or toeing any steps whatever, he would sit as their representative. He telegraphed back “Ho.” (Here a long interruption took place.) He asked them to consider whether his conduct had justified their choice. They had selected him for the public service for no other reason than that they thought he was fit to serve the public. And with regard to the wretched clamour that was made relative to holding office, he should like to know if the public was the only master who expected to be faithfully served for nothing. He was paid for his services, and a man need not be ashamed of that if he earned his pay honestly. The question was not whether he was the paid servant of the public, but whether the public got its money’s worth out of him in exchange. (Another long interruption from noise,) It was not necessary for hhn to go on against all that clamour. He had got a character of some sort- by that time, and if he could not stand on that it was no uss his saying anything. They would settle all the dispute before 12 o’clock next day. (Tremendous noise.) Mr. Boycott then came forward, and like Mr, Lowe was received with cheers and disapprobation. The hon. gentleman having concluded his address, a show of hands were taken, which resulted in favour of Mr. Boycott. A poll was demanded by Mr. Lowe. MARLBOROUGH. The nomination for this borough took place yesterday. The candidates were Lord Ernest Bruce, Mr, Henry Bingham Baring (at present residing abroad, but who was represented on the occasion by his son. Colonel Baring, of the Coldstream Guards), and Mr. ‘William David Lewis. The Mayor (Mr. T. Y. Styles) having opened the proceedings, with the usual formalities, Jk* £eeve proposed Lord Ernest Bruce. Mr. D. P. Maurice seconded the nomination, Mr. Akerman Xveson, amid cries of “ You don’t know whether be s dead, or alive,” and expressions of disapprobation, proposed Mr. Henry Bingham Baring. Mr. Alderman Lawrence seconded. The name of the third candidate, Mr. D. W. Lewis, was brought before the electors by Mr. Copeland, and endorsed by Mr. W. E. J. Reed. Lord Ernest Bruce declared himself to be an unhesitating supporter of Lord Palmerston. "We had to that statesman for a reduction of taxation, for the taking ofl the 9d. from the income-tax, and for carrying ont the principles of free trade. "With regard to the question of China Lord Bruce assured his hearers that he went entirely with the Government, and heartily approved their determination to stand by their officers. Lord Bruce would support the Premier, not as the Minister of Austria, or of Russia, but as the Minister of England. His lordship then proceeded to advocate tho cause of his absent friend, Mr. Baring, and said that he himself was to blame, if any blame could be attached to Mr. Baring for putting himself forward as a candidate on the present occasion, for he had prevented that gentleman from carrying out his intention of retiring. His lordship also declared that should his absent friend be elected, and fail to take his seat in six weeks, he would accept the Chiltem Hundreds. (“Hear, hear,” and cheers.) Colonel Baring briefly advocated the claims of his i&th er. Mr. Lewis, amid loud cheers, declared himself to be favourable to Lord Palmerston’s policy as regarded China, and as far as he could consistently he would always support the measures of the Premier; but, if elected, he would not enter Parliament other than as a thoroughly independent man bound to no party, and beyond the dictation of the wnipper-in of any Government. The show of hands was declared by the Mayor to be in favour of Lord Ernest Bruce and Mr. Lewis, who severally returned thanks for the honour conferred upon them. A poll haring been demanded on behalf of Sir. Baring, r°rd Bruce proposed, and Mr. Lewis seconded a vote of thanks to the Mayor for his courtesy and impartiaIl‘y injresiding on the occasion, and the proceedings terMALDON. ,, ?\e nomination of candidates for the representation of this borongh took place yesterday morning. Dr. Baker nominated Mr. Peaoooke in the Conservative interest, as a proper person to serve the borough in Parliament, which was seconded by Mr. Wood, a large farmer of the neighbourhood, Bramley-Moore, a Conservative, was then proposed PC* Kemp, and seconded by Mr. J. Thorpe Dr. G. Mat then nominated Mr. Sutton "Western, of helix-hall, a Liberal, and was seconded by Mr. J. Payne jun. * Mr, Peacocke, after apologizing for not being able personally to canvass the electors, and referring frith much humour to tho weak claims which his opponents had upon their suffrages, went on to vindicate his adverse vote upon tne Omna question, and to condemn in strong terms the general foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. He objected to the secret suffrage or vote by ballot, and to Mr. Locke Kino’s motion. He proceeded on the great principle that no great organic reforms should he effected unless there were correspending abuses to be removed, Mr. Bramley-Moore claimed their suffrages as an independent candidate of civil and religious liberty. He was in favour of some settlement of the church-rate question, n°ctra,ld P^ge himself to vote in favour of Sir Wilham Clay s Bill, which he considered almost a measure of spoliation. He had recorded his vote against Mr. Locke King's TnotlOD. Mr. Western addressed the meeting at some length on local topics, and avowed himself an advanced Liberal, and a supporter of Lord Palmerston, 1 The show of hands was declared to bo in favour of Mr Moore and Mr. Western, and a poll was therefore demanded for Mr. Peaoooke, winch will take place to-day.

No other candidate haring been proposed, Mr. Willcox, in a few sentences, announced his readiness to be judged by his past conduct in Parliamant. and to stand or fall accordingly, ,, Mj- Weguelin advocated the extension of the franchise, the ballot, the abolition of church-rates, religions equality national education, and cheap law for the people. He could not vote against the Maynooth grant, for he looked upon it as a great national compact, which, if maintained, would tend more to the peace and quiet of Ireland than its repeal could possibly do. With regard to the war in China; on which the Government had appealed to the country, he justified the vote he had given in support of the Government by a review of the circumstances of the case. He should, it again elected, _ give lord Palmerston an independent but not an indiscriminate support. Mr. Andrews’s name haring been withdrawn, Messrs, Willcox and Weguelin wore declared duly elected. The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks, to the retunung-officers.

He had not diluted hia principles down to a Liberal-Conservative in order to catch stray votes. Mr. Haly next addressed the constituency, contending for the old practice of the borough of having one candidate who was by birth connected with it.

WINCHESTER. nomination for this borongh took place yesterday (Friday), at St. John’s-house, the Mayor presiding. Sir James Duller East, ex-member and a moderate Conservative, was proposed by Captain Nerill, R.N., and seconded by Mr. Charles Wooldridge. Mr. John Bonham Carter, the Liberal ex-member, was proposed by Mr. Andrew Crawford, M.D., and seconded by Mr. Alderman Dowling. Mr. Wyndham Spencer Portal; a new Liberal Conservative candidate, was proposed by Mr. J. H. Todd the county coroner, and seconded by Mr. Alderman x order, • he solicited their suffrages for the eighth time. He had given Lord Palmerston’s Government a general support as an independent member, because he saw no other Government conld be formed to carry on the business of the country ; and, with reference to his vote against the Government on the China question, he gave it without any factions motives. He regretted this new war; he hoped they had done with the heavy expenditure of war; though he must admit,, if ho had beeuin . * almerston s place he should have supported his own official. But the House of Commons was bound to look at it in another light. For giving this judgment tho House h,i dissolution, at which ho was pleased, for it allowed him to come among his old friends once more, and he had no doubt his general principles would again insure him their confidence. Mr, Bonham Carter said, ho had as far as possible given eveiy elector a fair chance of questioning him upon hiq conduct for the last 10 years; he believed he could give a good reason forevery vote. He disclaimed being the nominee of any man. Ho voted against the Crimean Inquiry in the way proposed, because it would have been unfair to stab men m the dark. _ He had done his best to make the Police Bill harmonize with the preservation of their local rights. He had much to his chagrin reached the House of Commons too late by a few seconds to vote for Locke King’s motion, but ho had voted for it twice before, and had been instrumental m converting Lord John Russell to its support. He had laboured hard in the House, aud he thought Ins experience was worth something, and that the principles of civil, religious, and commercial freedom which he had always sought to carry ont by his votes would be trinmphantly vindicated in his renewed return, Mr. "Wyndham Portal said, he should support Lord Palmerston in upholding the honour of the British flag, bnthewas against warwhereit could bo possibljavoided. The motto on his flag would be, “Peace abroad, and progressive improvement at home.” He was in favour of a greatly extended franchise; he would vote that every now, who pud direct rates and taxes should have the franchise, and that it should be also given to all who had passed good examinations m our schools, colleges, or before the Society of Arts; in short, he snouldprefer making it not a question of money but of brains. He was in favour of the ballot, and ln favour of a Christian education. based on the Holy Scriptures for the whole population: opposed to the centrahzmg tendency of most of our late legislation; and hoped that in any scheme of reform there would be an equalization o* representatives to the population. Ho put great faith in the reformatory movements now going on, and was doing his best to fonvard them; and, if elected, he should try to get the income-tax assessed equitably, that uncertain incomes should not pay the same as those which were fixed. He would relieve Dissenters by an adjustment of churchrates. The show of hands was in favour of Carter and Portal, aud a poll was demanded for Sir James East, _ . MAIDSTONE. The nomination of candidates took place in front of the o’clock yesterday morning, ,Mr* w, Lee, the late member for the borough, a Liberal •who will give his independent support to Lord Palmerston, provided the Premieres prepared to cany ont Parliamentary Reform, to promote public education, retrenchment of the national expenditure, and a judicious system of legal social, and administrative improvement, was proposed by Mr. Stephens, and seconded by Mr. C. Arkcoll. Mr. A. J. B. Beresford Hope was next proposed by Alderman Stacey, and seconded by Mr. Laurence. . ,%°PE came forward as a decided Conservative. He denied that he was a Papist or had any Romanizing tendencies; and he challenged his opponents to define what was meant by the terms Puseyite and Tractarian, which had been applied to him. He was determined to maintain the rights and franchises of the freemen of the borough, should any new Reform Bill seek to annul thoso ancient privileges. r Mr. Hnmfrey Francis St. John Mildmay was next pnt in nomination, on behalf of the Liberals, by Mr.C. Elli£ sen., seconded by Mr. Stanger. The sentiments of this candidate axe identical with those of Mr. Lee, both of whom are advocates of the ballot. Captain Edward Scott was lastly named as a Conservative by Mr. H. Golden and Mr.G. "Wickham. This gentleman relies upon being an old inhabitant of the town, a supporter of the privileges of the freemen, and possessing a practical acquaintance with the local interests of the borough and the surrounding district. The Mayor declared the show of hands to be in favour of Messrs. Lee and Mildmay, and a poll was demanded on behalf of Messrs. Hope and Scott, which was fixed to take place this day. The town is remarkably qniet; for, although strong feeling has been expressed on both rides, there appears to be no indication of a resort to the violence which a day or two ago was very generally anticipated. COLCHESTER. The nomination of candidates for the representation of this borough took place yesterday, in front of the Townnail, where a large body of electors were assembled. Mx. S. Brown nominated Mr. Gnxdon Rebow, of Wiyenhoe-park, who was seconded by Mr. F. B. Phtlbriok. 1 Mr. G. Round nominated Mr. Taverner John Miler, who was seconde d by Mr. C. Hawkins. Mr. Havens, of Donyland, nominated himself asacanmdate, and in his address to the electors, complained thas the borough had been compromised by the resolution entered into by both parties not to sanction the nomination of a third candidate. It was this which had induced him. to determine to pnt himself in nomination, and he called upon the electors to assert the independence of their borough, and not to sanction a compromise of their political The nomination of Mr. Havens (who was accompanied by only two or three supporters) was seconded by Mr. Presnet, a working man. Mr. Rebow and Mr, Miller severally addressed the electors, reiterating the principles avowed by them at the election for this borough, which took place about a month since, when Mr, Rebow came off victorious in the contest with Mr. Miller. The show of hands was declared by the Mayor to be in favour of Mr. Rebow and Mr, Havens, upon which a poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Miller, and which was appointed to take place this day, . -d-t the last election Mr. Havens polled seven votes, and it is questionable whether that number will be exceeded on the present occasion. . # CHELTENHAM, it 0 ®o®jnation for this borough took place yesterday, Tr>TF,TM?2IR0 Prosed Captain F. ‘W. F. Berkeley: and Mr, J. Downing seconded the nomination. Captain Berkeley said, that the question for the country “7 WPjS> whether the lives and properties of British subjects were henceforward to be considered safe ; whethe treaties obtained by right were to be violated by barbarian tT1 i y whether tho flag of England was to be hauled down and trampled under foot ? During the late war the Administrations of Lord Derby and Lord Aberdeen broke down, but Lord Palmerston had conducted affairs to an honourable and, it was to behoped,alastingpeace. (Hear, hear,) Tho policy of Lord Palmerston was then highly approyed, even by the men ©{Manchester—the seat of the peace party (hear, hear) j and yet the heads of that party were now x»n?ed in liostilrty against him.

Althongh he approved Lord Palmerston’s foreign policy, he did not agree with him in his domestic measures. He viewed with great regret the opposition which the noble lord gave to Mr. Locke King’s Bill lor the extension of the franchise. Measures of reform were rendered inevitable in the present Parliament. Tho present system of voting at elections mnst be changed, and he should therefore support anv well-framed measure for the extension of th© franchise. If some stringent measure conld not be introduced to enable men to vote without the ballot, then the ballot mnst ha introduced. - Mr. Donald Nigoll said, he should enter Parliament, if ejected, not pledged to any particular Government or Minister, but pledged to support the cause of the people. He should cordially support an extension of the franchise, the abolition of the church-rates, the abolition of the taxes on knowle^e, and the adjustment of tho income-tax, making a difference between fixed and precarious incomes, ile was opposed to any thing like an aggressive or warlike tendency in foreign policy. Lord Edward Thynne said that if returned to Parliament he should go unfettered by Ministerial power to advocate all measures favourable to social improvement. He would oppose all unnecessary interference with the administrative functions of other nations. He was a firm supporter of tho Protestant church. He should not vote for the ballot. A show of hands was then taken, and declared to be in favour of Mr. Nicoll. A poll was demanded on behalf of both the other candidates. DROITWICH.

Sir John ridiculed tne idea that these proceedings would have the effect of increasing our trade with China, and believed it would have a tendency to diminish om fast increasing trade with that country ; but not only was the attack unjustifiable, it was a blunder; a more erroneous policy had never been admted.

LINCOLN (CITY), The nommation was held in the Guildhall, Lincoln, yesterday mornmg. Upon entering the room three cheers were given for Mr, J. H. Palmer, and three groans were accorded to Mr. G, Fieschi Heneago. Amid mnch tumult Mr. K. Mason proposed, and Mr. "W. Rudgard seconded the nomination of Mr. 6. F. Heneage. Mr. J. Hayward proposed, and Mr. C. Ward seconded the nommation of Major G. T. W, Sibthorp. Hr. J• Shuttleworth proposed, and Mr. J- Norton seconded Mr. John Hinde Palmer/ Mr. G. F. Heneage was received with groans. Ho retorred to the China question at considerable length, during which he was frequently interrupted. He gave the whole history of the commencement of the reign of the Palmerston Government, of which Ministry he was a supporter. He supported ifc on the question of the China war because he did not think that the English flag should be insulted. He was in favour of an extension of flie franchise. He was a Reformer, and, as such, had voted for many measures of reform ; among others. Catholic Emancipation. Major G. T. W. SlRTHOKp was well received, and referred at length to the China question. He produced bluebooks from which he proved that Sir J. Bowring had acted quite contrary to orders he had received from England. With regartt to tho income-tax, he was one who voted tor the reduction of that inquisitorial tax from 9d. to Od. in the pound, and, as the tax was agreed to n-P011 condition that it ceased at a certain rime, he should, at the time it was reduced to 6d., have voted for its total abolition if such a proposition had been wrought before the House. He did not support Locke King’s motion, hut he should bo prepared to support any reform commensurate with the growing intelligence of the people. Ho was most decidedly against the grant to Mayno® h. _ He was against the opening of the Crystal Palace and British Museum on Sunday, as he was against any motion which would Infringe upon the day which it was ordered should ha kept holy. He was in favour of national education, provided that the education given were based upon religious principles. He disclaimed on his part any coalition with either of the other candidates. Mr, J, H, Palmer was received with tremendous cheering. He said,—On the China question ho certainly could not take tho same lenient view that the gallant major did; for he considered that the Chinese people had Insulted the British flag. He should be glad to support any question of Parliamentary reform. *With extension of the suffrage he should support vote by ballot to prevent any tampering with voters. He was against the grant to Maynooth, or for any other payments of a like character from the State. Although a sincere Churchman, he was against the taring of Dissenters for the support of that church. He also advocated the policy of retrenchment in the public expenditure and administrative reform in general. A dipw of hands was then taken, when the Sheriff declarea tna« the choice of the electors had fallen upon Major Sibthorp and Mr. Hinde Palmer. x demanded for Mr. Heneage, which was fixed to be held to-morrow. , TYNEMOUTH. Tho election for this borough took place yesterday at 10 omock, when tho former member, Mr. YT.5. Lindsay, was returned without opposition. Daring the course of yesterday Captain LmskilZ issued an address, stating his intention to retire frointho contest, in consequence of having been detained m London until a considerable number of the electors had promised to vote for his opponent, who, although he held “ extreme Liberal opinions,* had likewise received conswerablo support from the Conservative party. Alter the usual preliminaries had been disposed of Mr. Lmdsay was proposed by Mr. J. Fawcus, and seconded by I^Uament^ as a fit person to represent the borough in Mr. Lindsay then addressed the electors. He commenredby referring to his conduct in Parliament, and Mated that his opinions were now, as they had ever been. Liberal. Hei kne w not what Captain LinskiU meant by an “extreme Liberal” If he meant the pulling down of the Church of England, as appeared from the bill issued by his supporters, such were not his (Mr. Lindsay’s) views. He desired reform in that church, as he felt the danger was bom within and not from without. (Hear, hear.) With reference to Lord Palmerston, he said, as this was likely to be the first return (the doction having taken place so early in the monung) he would state that ho was prepared to give Lord Palmerston a general support, hut that if his policy was portrayed by the speech delivered a. the Mansion-house, which ha (Mr. Lmdray) hjd the honour to hear, but which he heard with regret-or that of hu address to his Constituents at Tiverton, hecoold not fall down and worship that graven image. Ho could aot agree with a policy which act at nought all tho
usages of maritime warfare and bombarded a peaceable cite wittout reference to nght or justice. Presuming Lord Palmcreten te bothq head of a Liberal Cabinet, ho said again he should have his support, but if he opposed such measures as those introduced by Locke King, and if he did not givo his hearty support to secnmgcivil liberty to the Jews—it he opposed the Church Rate Bills and a measure of protection to tho honest voter, it would bo impossible for him (Mr. Lindsay) to support him. 1 OJe proceedings, which did not last an hour, terminated with & vote of thanks to the Mayor. _ . DUDLEY. The nommation for this borongh took place here yesterday. It was generally Imown that Mr. Bandars, Lord "Ward’s candidate, had withdrawn at the eleventh hoar, and that there would be no opposition to tho return of Mr. Sheridan • consequently tiie proceedings at the hustings were tame and uninteresting as compared with former elections in this borough. There were about 2,000 persons assembled in front of the hustings, chiefly comprised of the working classes, but their conduct was characterized by almost perfect indifzerence, and was wholly fro© from excitement or enthusiasm. _ “• a ironmaster and justice of the peace for the borough, proposed Mr. Sheridan as a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Parliament, and made a few remarks upon tho triumph which had been achieved by this election over tho influence of Lord ‘Ward and in favour of the independence of the borough. He eulogized Lord Ward as a liberal nobleman in reference to his uniform md general support of the institutions of the town and district; but, notwithstanding his title to such good and generous qualities, he denied his right to treat Lndley as a pocket borongh, and rejoiced that the result of this contest would teach his Lordship that he had no longer the power to send any one to represent the borough in Parliament he might think fit, without any reference to the choice of the electors. The nomination was seconded by Mr. E. GRAINGER in a few nnef remarks. ^ Sheridan then came forward, and in a brief speech thanked the electors for their kindness and uniform support since he came among them, reiterating the sentiments formerly enunciated by him at different meetings of tho elector, and promising to servo the interests of the borough m Parliament to the best of his ability. He would at all times pursue an independent course, whatever Ministry might he in power. _ He proposed a vote oflthanks to the returning officer, winch was seconded by Mr. Baden, when the proceedings terminated. , # HUDDERSFIELD. ^Tno nomination for this borough took place yesterday. The candidates proposed were Mr/W.Akroyd aud Mr. R Oobden. Mn T. B. Crosland proposed Mr. TY. Akroyd; and Mr. J, HAIOH seconded tho nomination. Mr. "W. Williams proposed Mr. Cobden ; and Mr. W. Mellor seconded tho nomination. Air. Akroyd having addressed the meeting, AJr- COBDEN rose, and was very warmly applauded. He spoke for upwards of an hour. Ho commenced by saying that, although ms fneuds had unduly alarmed themselves about ms state of health, he was not in the best possible condition for addressing such a largo audience as he saw before him, having overworked himself and been obliged to lay up for three days. Mr. Crosland, in bin manifold objcctions to him (Mr. Cobden) as the representative of Huddersfield scemed^to have lost sightof the question of principle ^together. (Hear.) He was not going into the question of the Russian war; hut he begged to remind his hearers that ho had never offered any opposition to the Government in carrying on that war, or to the House of Commons in voting the money which was required. The money had been raised without any opposition from him; the taxes had been laid on, and he had never divided tho House upon the subject. (A laugh.) It was well known that the Government spent all tho money as fast as they could, and they did not make a very good use of it. The result of that war. he honestly believed, had not been to make any human being on the face of tho earth either happier, or wiser, or better (A Yoice.—** Some a deal wiser than they were.”) He was attending a meeting at Paddock the other day, and, upon somebody raising a cry of “the Russian war,” a working man, whom he now saw before him, and who spoko like a philosopher, got up and said, “ We are not going to war again, I hope; we want something doing ] in the time of peace.” (Applause and laughter.) There was another question which had been thrown in his face; the question of the Chinese war. At all events, this country did not expcct to get either honour or glory out of that war. There was something to be got, if our Government had known how to go about it, in fair stand-up fight with such an enemy as Russia, but they managed so to conduct that war that precious little share of either honour or glory fell to our share in it. But in this Chinese war, if this country did its utmost, they would get no more honour or glory in tho eyes of the world than if they were to go into a sheep-market and fire all their cannon and musketry against so many sheep. But he was told that he was in favour of dishonouring the English flag. He had faithin the power and might of Englishmen to defend their flag against all comers in a just cause. (Applause.) All the world in arms could not disgraco the British flag if it had right and justice on its side, (Cheers.) The only men who could dishonour the flag of this country were those who were intrusted with power abroad, and who committed the country to au inglorious and unjust aggression upon a defenceless people. (Applause and disapprobation.) It had been said by his opponent that, with regard to tho Chinese war, tho wisest heads in England differed as to the legality of pur proceedings. Mr. Akroyd had said truly, that X/ird Lyndhurst, the highest legal authority in England, was on one side, and the Attorney (not the Solicitor) General was on the other. Yes, but one man was a man of 80 years of age, crowned with laurels, and who bad nothing to hope for from tho patronage of tho Government; the other was a man in the Government, and the crowning hope of his ambition was some day to be made Lord Chancellor. But, if the wisest lawyers in England had differed as to the right and justice of this country on the China question, was it consistent with right aud justice that our representative abroad should have taken the law into his own hands (applause), and, without giving opportunity to either the Queen or Parliament, to have a voice in the matter, commenced at once, upon such doubtful grounds as these, acts of hostility and outrage against a commercial city, covering tho site of that city with ruins, inflicting untold mischief upon innocent men, women and children ? "VThy, a man was not allowed to be convicted in England, oven upon a trifling charge of petty larceny, without the jud^o first telling the. jury,. “If you have any doubt upon the question, give the doubt in favour of the accused.” (A Yoice, “ We have none,” and applause.) Mr. Cobden next remarked that he believed the vote given upon tho motion which he had brought forward was one of the most honourable acts which the British Parliament ever accomplished. (‘c Hear, hear,” and cries of “ Ko, no!”) It was a motion made without concert, without previous communication ; and, whatever might be alleged against others who had voted on that question, it was a very curious fact that no one had ever accused the mover with having any sinister or dishonest object. (Cries of “No, nor and “Yes, yes!”) He challenged those gentlemen who said, “ No” to produce any responsible person, or writer of any authority, who had publicly stated that he was a party to the “ conspiracy.” Mr. Cobden then reiterated the assertion which he had made in a previous address—that if Lord Palmerston had announced the intention of the Government to send out an ambassador to China tho division in the House of Commons would never have taken place, and that Lord Palmerston had. intentionally avoided doing so in order that he might have a pretence of dissolving Parliamentupon some cry aboutOhina, well knowing that he had no domestic policy with which to goto the country, and knowing thathe had no credit with Reformers. (“ Hear,” “No !” and applause.) The hon. gentleman next reminded the assembly that the electors of Huddersfield were about to select a candidate to represent them in Parliament for seven years, and he hoped that the China question would be all settled and pretty nearly forgotten in less than two years. He believed that tho electors of Huddersfield would think about something else in choosing their representative. His friend Mr. Akroyd had told them in rather a misty and hazy manner what his politics were, but unfortunately ho (Mr. Cobden) could not put himself behind a veil like that. His politics were known by his votes; and he did not come there to make a new profession of faith, or to tell them that he was going to alter nis opinion in any respect. He then glanced at several of the most important measures which he had advocated since tho repeal of the com laws, enumerating the imposition of a tax^ upon tho succession to real property, the abolition of the advertisement duty and the stamp upon newspapers: and several measures which he had supported py nis vote, and sometimes by his voice, some of. which had been successful, and the remainder he would still continue to fight for. He expressed his well known opinions in favour of household suffrage and the ballot, taking the opportunity to contradict the erroneous statement that the ballot in Melbourne was permissive, and not compulsory. .On this latter subject he said that he spoko from the authority of the gentleman who was instrumental in establishing the ballot in that country. From the success which, had there attended the experiment he spoke very strongly in its favour. -After dwelling upon the energy, determination, and perseverance which were required to accomplish any reform, Mr. Cobden pledged his w ord that in the event of his being returned for Huddersfield ho would never remain quiescent or allowhis principles to go to sleep. He concluded by calling upon the electors to give him their aid and assistance, and by stating that if they did their duty he should havo the honour of next addressing them as their representative. (Loud cheers and uproar.) The show of hands was then taken, and the returning officer declared it to be in favour of Mr. Cobden. Great cheering followed the announcement. Mr. Crosland demanded a poll for Mr. Akroyd. The poll takes place to-day. HALIFAX, The nomination took place yesterday. Mr. J. -Appleyard proposed the Right Eon. Sir Charles "Wood as a fit and properperson for a representative of the borough ; Mr. J. Crossley seconded the nomination. Mr. Alderman Brown proposed Mr. Frank Crossley, and the nomination was seconded by Mr. J. Kilby. Mr. J. Abbot then nominated Major H. Edwards, and the nomination was seconded by Mr. G. Hajgh. SirC. WoODreferredto nine previous elections at which he had been returned as a representative of Halifax in Parliament, and expressed his trust that he had done nothing to forfeit the good opinion of the electors. Ho reminded them that he had supported the repeal of those laws which oppressed the Dissenters aud tho penal laws affecting the Roman Catholics; the Reform Bill, which conferred the franchise upon Halifax, among tho other great boroughs of England; the reform of municipal corporations; and he had contributed, either as an independent memherof Parliament or as a Minister, to all those measures which had removed from trade and commerce tho bonds by which they were fettered, and thus benefited allko the manufacturer?, tho agriculturists, and, what was still more, the great mass of consumers in tms country. (“ Hear,” usd applause.) Tho course which ho had hitherto pursued for upwards of 30 years of Parliamentary life he proposed to continue to tho end, (Applause.) Ho glanced at the proceedings of Government during tho late session, and domed tho allegation that the Ministry was characterized by turbulence and aggression. An assemblage of parties die-
generally, and at Halifax in particnlar, lie found little or no difference of opinion (applause! andevpnL;e»,J«&*d.orno (Major Edwax/a) drofflMo Sff-bSfS^ISSS P?“m°D?i1^w10ald havo Y°ted with tho Goveinmeht ^t had been said that a possible effect of bis ***} ^VP^haSent w°®Jd k°> that * new peer wonhf ba added to the House of Lords: but he desired to be allowed to Jhat be had no such ambition; he preferred being the selected representative of Halifax to the brightest Selraia his Sovereign could confer upon him.

In answer to questions, he expressed himself in favour of extending the franchise to 5L rating in boroughs, and said that he would not vote for tho abolition of the Maynooth grant, or for the inspection of iiomanOathoIio monasteries and nunneries. a '••EAjA fovour of such reforms as wore consistent with the legitimate development of the constitution, but opposed to all experiments of a hazardous or revolubon»y character.

With reference to 10k occupiers in counties, he would give them a right to vote in some of the smaller boroughs. As to financial reform, he was in favour of economy in the expenditure, and of a proper adjustment between direct and indirect taxation, mid especially would ho exclude incomes less than 1501. *- year from the direct tax.

Somerville said that to his short address ho should beopen, candid, rad above-board, to order that to the exercise of their privilege the electors might know what he was, and if he was not what he ought to be that they might instantly withhold their suffrages from him. He Sid allude very briefly to the China affair. At that moment he found the state of affairs in that country not so favourable as he thought it was; perhaps a little time would elapse before the war-if it was a war-could be concluded, which he hoped would be in a manner that would refieot honour rad credit upon this country (hear), aud •j s.r°7_ a resuff ho should contribute his humble aid u he was returned as their representative. A plenipotentiary was now on his way to that country. Might tas mission be a mission of peace, might the angel of peace attend him, and might we shortly hear from that distant land that war rad all its horrors were at an end 1 Honestlv ho thought the affairs of China had very little, if anything to do with the question they had now to decide. Long after the aflairs of China should be settled their representatives would be sitting in the House of Commons, making laws for them and their children. (Hear, hear.)

If ray Government brought forward constitutional measures he would give them his most cordial support. He had been dubbed an out-and-out Tory; he was no such thing. (“ Oh, oh 1”) He was for progress. (Laughter and cheers.) Mr. O. P. Cooper declared himself a Liberal, and advocated tho ballot as tho root of all reform; rad he also was in favour of an extension of ihe suffrage.

"While the Mayor was proceeding with the preliminaries, some alarm was created by the platform on which the Liberal candidate rad his snpportors were standing giving way. It fell with a tremendous crash. It was at first roared that Mr. Ewart was hurt, hut he fortunately escaped without injury. It being found that there was great dragerthat the entire hostings would come down, the Mayor adjourned theprocecdtogs. when they were resumed, Mr. "W", Potter proposed Mr. Thomas Berry Horsfall as a fit and proper person to represent the borough to Parliament. Mr. J. A. Tobin, merchant and shipowner, seconded the proposition. Mr. P.HEYWOODproposedMr. Joseph Christopher Ewart. Mr. J. Aiken, a magistrate, seconded the nomination. Mr. "W". Ttrerproposed, andMr. J. Holmes seconded,(the nomination of Mr. Charles Turner. Mr. Horsfall said he would not dwell on that recent vote which had been instruments in returning him to his constituents. He had supported the Government, rad he did not hesitate to say that, be it npon the China question or any other question to wMoh he Believed Her Majesty’s Government to be right, they shonld have his cordial support ; hut where he believed them wrong he should do aU in his power to oppose them. Mr. J. C. Ewart was desirous of being judged by his public conduct, rad ho referred to ihe part he liad taken, along with his friend rad late colleague Mr. Horsfall, to opposing the Anti-Dock Dues Bill to Parliament, As to the Bank Restriction Act, he thought that what might have been good to 1844 was scarcely likely to be so to 1857, when the exports were nearly doubled. He had long been of opinion that that restriction Act was far too severe in its operations, rad, though he did not think it advisable to pledge himself to any specific course, he shonld give the report of the special committee his best consideration. Mr. C. Turner also addressed the meeting, and the show of hands was declared in favour of Messrs. Horsfall and Tomer. A poll was demanded for Mr. Ewart. ARUNDEL. The nomination for this borough took place yesterday. Mr. Alderman Sna it proposed Lord Edward G. Fitz-Alan Howard. Mr. Alderman New seconded the nomination. No other candidate having been nominated, the returning officer declared Lord Edward Howard duly elected. Lord Edward Howard, to thanking the electors fertile honour they had done him, said that dnring tho last few years the name of Lord Palmerston had assumed a great degree of prominence, rad he was quite ready, as he had stated to his address, to give him his general support as long as he considered it would be for the benefit of the country; but when he thought that doing so would be injurious, he wouldwithdraw that support. As regarded tbe _ Chinese _ question, he gave Lord Palmerston credit for having done what ho considered best, and for that reason had voted with the Government against Mr. Cohden’s motion. (Hear, hear.) As regarded the bestowal of patronage by Government, he was of opinion that merit. should he the test, not birth and fortune. (Hear, hear.) But they must not suppose that, by adopting even this standard, they would have officers appointed with whom all would be satisfied. Sir John Bownng had been sent to China, not because he had family influence, but because he was able and energetic. He was a man sprang from among the lower ranks, and, having been a good merchant’s clerk,, was thought fit to be promoted to a post of honour and responsibility. But, notwithstanding merit had been to this instance the only tost, he got us into our present Chinese difficulties. Ho had been asked some questionsrespecttognational education. He would wish to give every man a sound educa-" tion, but he could not agree with those who wished to throw the expense on local rates. The county rad borough rates were now quite high enough, rad he could not give his consent to increasing them. A vote of thanks to Mr. Bull (returning officer), proposed by Lord E. Howard and seconded by Mr. Alderman Marshall, brought the proceedings to a close. REIGATE. The nomination for this borough took place yesterday at the Town-hall, Rcigate.

No other candidate having been proposed, the senior high constable, Mr. Saxby, declared that too election had fallen on the Hon. H. Fitzroy rad the Hon. H. Brand. (Cheers.) Mr. Fitzboy, to returning thanks, said there was at present no great question before them, rad they had only to ask what Minister was entitled to their confidence. Ho defended Lord Palmerston from the charge of being a war Minister, and to proof of this referred to the results of his_ administration in former years. As to his home policy, he quoted the noble lord’s address to toe electors of Tiverton as eminently satisfactory. If they had not reforms to the next Parliament it would be toe fault cf the people of England who did not send men to Parliament prepared to advocate their views, though from the time that had been lost little could he done this year. The next Parliament wonld have, however,_ to deal with important subjects. The treatment of criminals aud juvenile offenders, the abolition of churchrates, the total assertion of civil and religions liberty, aud progressive improvement to all their institutions, would demand their earnest attention. It would ho useless to refer to details. _ His votes expressed his views. He concluded by thanking them for their support. Mr. Brand having addressed toe electors. The proceedings terminated.

To that difference he should adhere still; he would not deceive them in anything; and if they returned him again to Parliament he wonld not support Lord Palmerston's Government, nor any Government he thought wrong in its course of action on so vital and important a matter as peace or war with a nation so useful to British commerce as China (or any other essential to our welfare) npon the hare acts of a Government official alone.

(Cheers.) Lord Ealmerstons Government had been enabled to make conmderahle reductions in toe national expenditure, to taka oirthe war ninepence of income-tax, and to lighten the dories which pressed more especially on tea and sugar. He did not entertain the view which some persons took on the rote against the Government on the China question; and. although hemight differ from them entirely on many points, he did not believe the majority gave that vote from factions motives. For himself, he never gave a vote in his life with more hearty concurrence tom when he voted on that occasion in support of our officers abroad, who, at a great distancq from onr shores, had to decide to a moment a grave rad difficult question to the face of a barbarous and unyieldThe other candidates having addressed the electors, a show of hands was taken, which resulted in favour of - Mr Labouohere and Mr. Mills.

Ireland was now enjoying the blessings of peace, and be thought it would be unwjse to endanger tho tranquillity of that country hy withdrawing a grant which he considered was essential to the education of the Roman Catholic priesthood. (Hear.) Alluding to local matters, Mr. Fitzwilliam said if tho electors did him the honour again to return him to Parhament, they might rely upon his exertions to serve them. He should give his support to Lord Palmerston, and Ait-hough, that noble lord had been unfavourable to measures of reform, he (Mr. Fitzwilliam) considered that his course in Parliament, aud through life, had been in favourof progress when consistent with common sense. "With respect to the ballot, he should, as he had done before, vote against that question. The system of vote by ballot had been tried to France and America, and had failed. In conclusion he referred the electors with confidence to the votes he had ffiYcn, and thanked them for their patient hearing of him.

The seizing of the Arrow was only the turning point of many insults. Was there a man with the blood of an Englishman in his veins who would see the British flag treated with contempt t (Cheers.) He justified toe conduct of Sir John Bowring ana Admiral Seymour on every ground; and concluded by hoping that his conduct as x\,r.atrurm£ the lonS Period he had represented them entitled him to their warm support. Mr. Price said, he was to favour of toe ballot, »ad would give Lord Palmerston an independent support. He would vote for him so long as tho Premier brought to those lateral measures upon which he believed tho prosperity and weilare of the country depended. He thought that Lord Palmerston’s Government ought not to have endorsed the proceedings of Sir J. Eowrtog, and therefore he did not vole for them on toe late question; but as the Government were not responsible for the war ho declined to vote against them. He regretted that Lord Palmerston did not yield to toe wishes of 100 of Ilia supporters, rad do before toe division what he did after—namely, sent out to China a gentleman to control Sir J. Bowring.

He should vote forthe reduction of the income-tax when that measure came forward again, and ho was also to favourof a reduction of the duty upon teaand sugar. With respect to Lord Palmerston’s Government beto g opposed by tho Conservatives when any important question was brought forward, he would only state that no party could have given Lord Palmerston greater support and advice to bringing the Russian war to a conclusion than that body. Adverting to the China question, the noble lord contended that no official shonld he allowed to commence hostilities with a foreign Jrower uuthout the sanction of the Government, and ho considered that the fact of Lord Palmerston sending out Lord Emin, to mpersedo Sir John Bowring was a sufficient justification of the vote he had given on tho Canton question. Now that the war has commenced it mast te earned on in earnest, rad he should give his support to ray Government that would bring it to a sneedy rad honourable conclusion. Mr.. C. Healey proposed the Hon. F. J, ToIIemacho, opposition to Lord Graham, as a fit and proper poison servo in Parliament. ^ Mr, T. Bushby seconded the nomtoation. The Hon. F. J.Tollemache referred to the determination of Lord Graham to support tho Protestant institutions of this country. Ho was himself favourably disposed to Protestantism, but ho was sorry to observe the largo amount R°pery that was at tho present time mixed up with it.

Yesterday, at noon, the nomination of candidate; for ibis town took place on hustings erected to tho Marketplace, to the presence of a largo eonoonrse of the inhabitants; Mr. T. Birch, the Mayor, presided at the ceremony. Mr. B. Osborne and Sir W. Bussell, the Ministerial candidates, were escorted from their head-quarters, gi'ihe Ship Hotel, to the place of nomtoation by a greit hqdY of their supporters ; and a number of the adherents of Sir G, Clerk and Mr, Hope, the two Literal Conservative candidates, accompanied thorn thither from the Lord Warden Hotel, Tho weather was fine; the ceremony was made the occasion of an almost general holyday to tho town; the bells of St. Mary’s Church rang merrily at inter— vals, and banners and other party emblems waved from tho houses of many of the principal inhabitants. As the several candidates took np their positions on the hustings they wero greeted with the usual party demonstrations from the crowd below. Sir George Clerk was nominated and seconded by Colonel Hammond rad Mr. Clayton respectively, Sir William Russell by Mr. Sterriker Ftonis and Mr. James Worsfold, Mr. Osborne by Mr. Rice, one of the late members for the borough, and Ur. Charles Lamb, andMr. Hope by Mr. Pitt Smith and Mr. J. C. Ottaway, a surgeon, the latter of wb ora took occasion, to broad allusion to Mr. Osborne, to warn the electors not to send a Joe Miller to Parliament. Great fun was caused by some “roughs ” belonging to * .nsorvativo party parading a cock pheasant decked with ribands and mounted on a pole in front of the hustings, by way of practical comment on some rather hard justice winch was recently meted out on a poor boy, for au znfraction of the game laws, by Mr. Rice, one of the members for the borough in the last Parliament, in his capacity of a magistrate. r * Sir G. Clerk first addressed ihe electors. He said ha appeared before them in consequence of tho invitation sent 0 him by a most numerous and respectable body of the electors, and he would assure them that nothing had been more gratifying to his feelings than to receive such a testimony of their regard. It had not been his intention to solicit tho suffrages of any constituency, and ho would tell them frankly that he shonld not have offered himself even to the electors of Dover unasked aud unsolicited; bub after H**1? PSeive<i thai!. invitation he felt it was due to those who had forwarded it to him and to all his friends in Dover tnat be should lose no time in appearing before them to express his gratitude for the compliment they had paid himIhe reception he bad met with upon coming down to Dover had exceeded his most sanguine expectations. (Cheers.) He had endeavoured during the short interval winch had elapsed since he received that invitation, as faras he had been able, to pay his personal respects to ©very elector in the town j and ho must say, that the kindness with which he had ©very where been received, and the marks of affection which had been shown towards himself, had produced ou his mind au effect which, let the result of the election be what it might, would never bo obliterated. (Cheers.) He felt happy to say that the promises of support, which had man,? i»»taaces given him without his solicitation, and the cordiality which had been on all hands shown himmft him no reason whatever to doubt tho result. (Cheers.) He could onlv further say on that point, that if by any accident he had not paid his respects to any freeman or elector, such freeman or elector would attribute it not to any want of respect on his part, but to the shortness of tho time that had elapsed, and to the difficulties which had arisen, nom change of residence and other similar causes. (Hear, hear.) H© now appeared before them to exP.lau1., course of politics he would pursue, should he bo honoured with their suffrages and rogirned as one of their representatives in the next Parliament. Ho bad no hesitation whatever in stating, in confirmation of what had fallen from the Ups of thegaUanb colonel who had proposed him, thafc if ho were sent to Parliamenthe should nob go there with the view of offering factious opposition to Dord Palmerston, but that, on the contrary, it was his wish to give an independent support in reference to aU meagores which Lord Palmerston mighs bring forward, and which he (Sir G. Clerk) in his conscience believed would be likely promote the welfare of the country, (Cheers.) After hia long public life he did not think they would attend much to any professions he might make as to what he would do hereafter. He must be content to be judged by his past conduct, and he thought that Tvas a fair test by which every public yn*u might ..l l* 1 ?no those very amusing speeches with which his hon. opponent had favoured tho electors lie had taken a review of the whole of his (Su* G. Clerk’s) career from the time at which he first entered Parliament. Hr. Osborne had been perfectly right in. filing so; he had nothing to complain of in the manner in which he had done it j on the contrary, he had to thank him, which he did most unfeignedly, forthe kind observations he had made with regard to his (Sir G. Clerk’s) situation as a private gentleman. H© might not admit exactly tho correctness of the likeness which Mr. Osborne had drawn—ho thmk the picture somewhat exaggerated, bat on the wholohe wouldsay candidly ho had not much to complain ofTbe right hon. baronet then entered in some detail into a defence of his political life, tbe purport of which may bo collected from the speech of 2klr, Osborne, in which that gentleman took up one by one and commented upon the points ca which Sir George had. principally dwelt. He concluded by saying that if the electors sent him to Parliament he shonld go there perfectly independent; thafc, though he owed no allegiance to Lord Palmerston, he would give him an honest and conscientious support, aud that ho had no party feelings of sympathy for the leading 111611 111 the House of Commons who were nowopposed to the noble lord. He asked them to send him to Parliament in order that he might support measures, and nqfcmen, and exerciseto the best of his ability his own conscientious feelings on the questions which might be brought under the consideration of the House. (Cheers.) SirYT. Russell followed in a brief speech. He complamed that, though he had listened attentively to the speech of the right hon. baronet who had preceded him, he had been ^ unable to gather from it any statement of the principles on which he sought to represent the constituency of Dover, He reminded toe electors? that, in his printed address, ho (Sir "W. Russell) had stated that ho was an advocate for all measures of progresf!ve *e*orm» b°th religious and political, and in favour of that broad line of policy which had been carried forward by the Libaral party in past times, and which had secured to the people of England tho repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, and had given them Catholic Emancipation. Municipal Reform, and the repeal of the Com Laws. (Cheers.) The hon. haronob concluded by saying that he had spent 16 years of his life in learning his duties as % soldier, aud if the electors should return him to Parliament he should endeavour to do hia duty towards them in * political capacity. (Cheers.) Mr. Osborne then stood forward to address the electors, and on doing so was received with loud and prolonged cheering, mingled with some disapprobation from th* opposite party. Ho said:—Mr. Mayor, electors, freemen, and non*olectors of Dover,—There is a species of nonelector, to whom I am not now so much looking in thafc comer (pointing to some roughs who were creating a disturbance), as to those non-electors in tho shape of ladies who now grace those windows with their presence (cheers), and who, I hope, will impart to this contest, if not that elegance which is convened in that comer (laughter), at least that good humour which is generally the case when a contest is graced by the female sox. (Cheers.) I further hope thafc w© shall have no bribery more bewitching than their smiles, and no intimidation more formidable than the rather noisy lot who are assembled below me, (Cheers and laughter.) Gentlemen, we have put our Grenadiers to tho front. (A laugh.) You have heard the exposition given by Sir William Russell of his principles, and I shall come by and by to—shall I call them principles ?—rather, I should say, to the excuses which have proceeded from the other side, I was very much amused, as I think you all must have been, when that gallant colonel (Colonel Hammond) who proposed my hon, opponent. Sir George Clerk, and who has in distant fields and in other climes led almost more f orlomhopes than, he has on tho present occasion (cheers and laughter),—I say I was much amused when, probably instigated by the spirit of Shakspeare which gleams over his own name (pointing, amid much laughter, to a tavern in the Market-place called the Garrick’s Head, kept by one Hammond), ho figured to himself that the hon. baronet he was proposing was a folower of Lord Palmerston. I have read the poll-book taken, at the last election for Dover, and I find thafc the gallant colonel on that occasion voted a plumper for my Lord Chelsea. (Cheers.) And what was my Lord Chelsea, and how did ho vote in regard to tho Government of Lord Palmerston ? "Why, he voted agaaast Lord Palmers tom But now, hy a most curious mosaic piece of patchwork, we have two gentlemen proposing and seconding the nomination of Sir Georg© Clerk who formerly plumped for my Lord Chelsea, How, I want to ask you what has become of my Lord Chalsea 1 I agreo with you that ne has been shamefully 1 can fancy your honest and unsophisticafcedhearfcs boiling with indignation to see the man whom you formerly placed at the head of your poll by your honest and unbought votes (an ironical laugh) sent away from Dover on disgrace, and two gentlemen whose principles we havo nofcyst succeeded in discovering imported into Dover by gentlemen who were formerly of a blue colour in tbis town, hut who ar© now voting under the colour of red ? (Cheers.) Whyj what has Lord Chelsea done? (Uproar, caused hy a Tioan in the crowd.) Let me request that policeman who was turned ont of the force for being not all for love, but a litfclo lot tbe bottle, to hold his tongue for a short time. (Laughter.) Lord Chelsea did not, it is true, fill your lodging-houses, as was promised at the last election; Lord Chelsea did not pave your streets with gold; but h0' did what he said he would do. He voted consistently, he came before you as & Tory ; ho did not put Ins principles in his pocket; he told you fairly what he was ; he said he would vote against a Liberal Government; he did so; and what have his supporters done? Because my Lord Chelsea was a consistent man they have deserted him in his hour of noed, and they bave taken up with two gentlemen whose principles they don’t even know. (Cheers and uproar.) May 1 trouble my stentorian friend there, who I think asked me for a place last week, to hold hjs peace T (Chewsand laughter, and ones of “Rame.”) No, I promised not to tell (laughter); but there he is. (Renewed uproar.) Well, gentlemen, I am obliged for that interruption, for I bad nearly forgotten a gentleman who does not deserve to he forgotten. (A laughj Tbe gentleman who seconded the nomination of Mr. Hope has kindly likened me, is reference to a speech I recently made in this town, to Joe Miller. He ismotja homoeopathic doctor; he has given us a good dose, and i U 1 were inclined to lay that able anatomist
Us own board I feould recommend him to stick to different operations and not to endeavour to teach the electors of Dover what their political principles ought to be. (Cheers and laughter.) I say that in perfect good humour to that gentleman, who I suspect is mote versed in the light ol Jot Miller than in the deeper subjects of the British Constitution. I would recommend him, who X am sure from his face never perpetrated a joke in his life (a laugh), when he is talking of Jot Miller, to P*r attention to another great author—Drelinoourt, On Heaih; and as he has likened me to Joe Miller I advise “ “ •ne comes into the arena again to get his speech a little better by heart, and not to trifle with edge-tools, for a man may cut himself with his own scalpel. (A laugh.) Bnt, away with these mere local disputes, these harmless electioneering squibs, which no man pardons more readily or more delights in than myself. I come now to the more serious business of the election. Now, gentlemen, you have heard the speech of my hon, opponent Sir 6. Clerk—for Whom in his private capacity I have the most sincere respert—;a very able speech, and not the less able because he raokofor three-quarters of an hour and never told you what Hs principles were. (A laugh.) Gentlemen, that is a great Parliamentary art, and he learnt it in that school over which Sir Robert Peel presided with so much ability; for my Lord Derby said on a very remarkable occasion that it was impossible for any man, or set of men, to dress up a case with so much efficiency, or to put a more specious colouring no nothing, than Sir Eobert Peel and his followers. The hon. baronet (Sir George Clerk) has occupied your attention by referring to a recant speech of mine, in which I endeavoured to take an historical view of the two parties, "Whig and Tory, since 18X8. He has told you he was in Parliament in ISIS, and he has stated one thing which I think is rather remarkable. For the first time in my life I have heard to-day that Sir Eobert Peel carried the Test and Corporation Act. (A laugh.) I hope the history you may road on that subject will not be Clerk’s history (a laugh), but that yon know from the real histoiy of the day that that Act was carried by Lord John Knssell and the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But what, in peant of fact, is the contest at issue ? (Uproar from the “ Beds.”) Now, really, sir (pointing to a working man in the crowd), if you will only go and mend that pair of shoes yon have left at home, you will do me a great favour. (A laugh.) At least, if you cannot ho quiet he as quiet as you can. Will yon come up here, at any rate? (Laughter.) This is a contest between two principles. There are but two men who can make a Government at the present day; the one is Lord Palmerston, and the other is Lord Derby. Which will you have? (A shout—"Palmerston.”) It is very well for Sir George Clerk to say that he will not give “ any factious opposition” to Lord Palmerston. What do you fancy lord Palmerston thinks him (Sir G. Clerk) on the present occasion! What would Lord _ Palmerston call “ a factions opposition” bnt an opposition to a member of his Government? (Cheers.) Is not this a most strange kind of love that two hon. gentlemen should come down hare and say they are all for Lord Palmerston, but that they wish to turn out a member of Iris Government ? X have heard of love being expressed in many shapes and forms. X have known mon who have beaten their own wives (a laugh), and yet they are said to have been very fond of them; but of all the love and of all the support I have ever heard, the most extraordinary is that of these two gentlemen who coma down to Dover to support Lord Palmerston by endeavouring to turn out Lord Palmerston’s Secretary to the Admiralty. (Cheers.) But, gentlemen, who is the real head of that party to which my two hon. opponents belong ? (Cries of “ Derby” and “ Disraeli.”) No. There is a man of great capacity, but I think no one knows to what that gentleman will come. He seems to me to be oscillating between the Cabinet and the cloister. (A laugh.) That man is Mr. Gladstone; and he is the leader of that party. Now, how is Mr. Gladstone disposed to the Government of Lord Palmerston? Lord Palmerston, let me remind you, did not come to his present position by anything like intrigue. He came there when every otherman was obliged to refuse the task of making a Government. Lord Derby was sent for in the first instance; and what was Lord Derby’s first step? He said, “Ican make no Government without Lord Palmerston.” He sent for Lord Palmerston, and offered him the lead of the House of Commons. Lord Palmerston at once refused. ("No, no.”) Aye, I see my friend there believes only in Clerk’s history. (A laugh.) Lord Palmerston, I say, refused. ("No, no.”) I can only say ho told me so himself; and if yon In that comer there had read the newspapers with half the attention that you have been helping to shout hero to-day (a laugh) you would have known that Lord Derby acknowledged it himself last week. Lord Palmerston refused-feat office, and Lord Derby gave up the attempt to form a Government. Lord John Bussell was next sent for to form a Government, and what was his first step ? "Why, hesentforLordPahnerston,andLordPalmer8ton,seeing that differences had previously existed between them, most generously said, “ I will consent to serve nndet you; the country shall not be without a Government at snob an eventful period, and I will servo under your banner.” (Cheers.) But no other man would servo with Lord John Bussell on that occasion; and he also was obliged to give np tho attempt to form a Government. The consequence was that the Government was thrust upon Lord Palmerston ; ho did not seek it. And what next occurred? Sir J. Graham and Mr. Gladstone soon afterwards left his Government because the noble lord consented to the inquiry into the state of the army and the causes of the misery it endured in the Crimea, Lord Palmerston was therefore left alone to conduct the Governmentat a mosteventfulperiod; ho was deserted by thatparty; and hadit not been that the people of England stood by him at that most eventful time, fancy what the consequences would have been. As it was, he conducted the war, as you know, to a successful termination, and the peace of which we are now happily in tho enjoyment is also to be attributed to him. (Cheers.) But what was the conduct of tho party who left Lord Palmerston ? "Whether it arose from Lord Palmeiston’s ■excellent appointments in the church, or whether it arose_ it may not have been, but there ara people who suspect it arose from that—from a spirit of hostility towards Lord Palmerston on tho part of some of these gentlemen which cannot be explained on other grounds, is not now known. Those gentlemen who have teen acting with Lord Palmerston for tho last two years, and who had known his honour and integrity, suddenly turned round and attacked him in a manner which can only bo done by old friends. (A laugh.) "When the Government of Lord Palmerston—to advert to the question of tho income-tax—took off •• tho wax 9d.,” one would suppose that all parties in the House of Commons would have agreed to that; but what was really the stale of the case? Mr. Gladstone attacked the Government with an hostility which unless you had been there you would not have believed. It was almost as bitter as the manner in which Mr. Ottaway has attacked me to-day. (A laugh.) But we heat Mr. Gladstone on that occasion, as we intend to beat Mr. Ottaway on this. (Cheers.) The budget was carried by a majority o! 82. "What did they do next? Then come the affair of the China vote. I will not talk shout that now, for I dare say everybody is sick of it. X voted with Lord Palmerston on that occasion. I voted for him in support of the honour and the flag of this country. (Cheers.) I would not see my countrymen deserted abroad, and althongh tho dissolution of Parliament has been the result of the division on that subject, you will not conceal from yourselves that tho contest rests on two grounds —namely, whether you will send to Parliament those who will really rapport the Government of Lord Palmerston, or those who now come forward and say they support that Government, and yet who mike a covert attack upon the noble lord at the same time. I defy any man to have listened to the speech of Sir G. Clark without perceiving that when he was saying one word for lord Palmerston he was saying ten tor himself, and that he only selected that portion of lord Palmerston’s public life when I grieve to say Lord Palmerston had not acquired the wisdom he has now done, and when he was not tho leader of the Liberal party. Sir G. Clerk supports Lord Palmerston as he was in 1818, and I as he is in 1857. I support bin, in bettor days; Sir G. Clerk goes back to a time when Lord Palmerston was a Tory of his own dye. Bnt, he says, “ What did you do with Locke King’s motion ?” I will tell him what 1 did. Mr. Locke King brought forward a motion for extending the 10?. franolusa to counties. It so happens that I never voted for that motion, not that I object to it much in that shape, but because if you merely give a 10?. franchise to the counties, what becomes of tho boroughs? You cannot bring in a measure of reform of that sort. If there is to be any measure of reform it must be done on different considerations and on different grounds. I at once profess myself what I have always been, an advocate for the extension of the suffra«e. I come before you with no false colours. I am a memberof a Government, as Lord Palmerston is a member of a Government, who brought forward a Reform Bill which was quashed by the Euasian war. Thera are principles dearer to me than office. So long as I can hold office consistently with my principles office is au honourable distinction; but if I am to hold office shackled, and to be sent into the House of Commons as a slave from Dover to vote contrary to convictions, I say office is no ■object to me. (Cheers.) But my hon. opponent has told you ho is a friend of Lord Palmerston. So did Brutus tell ■Cmsax when he stabbed him in the Senate-house, and sorely “ Brutus was an honourable man.” (Cheers and laughter.) Bat if he is a friend of Lord Palmerston X trust he will treat his new friend better than he did his old, and not as he treated Protection in bygone years. No, let us have plain principles. X honour and respect the Tory party; they are a great party, and have never hidden their colours. They have not come to you one day, and said they were Liberal-Conservatives—God knows what that means (a laugh); they have gone for certain principles, great principles, principles to he understood; bnt I cannot understand that small knot of men who are one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, who catch votes from both sides, and who worship tho goddess expediency, before whom I, J?r one, am not prepared to bow down. (Cheers.) I respect the Tory party, but I cannot understand this new party who are a sort of tesselated pavement, made up of patches which no man os a take as a banner, and in whom no trust or confldence can bo placed. (Cheers.) The only clear thing which I could learn from the speech of my hon. friend was that he was against the ballot. Well, gentlemen, I am for the ballot. (Cheers.) He says Lord Palmerston is not in favonx of the ballot. He is not; no more is lord John _ Bussell But don’t look on the ballot as a principle; it is a mere detail. I am not an enthusiastic admirer of the ballot. I think the constituencies are the best judges. Bnt when X see a man who comes to me in this town and says, “X am ‘bine’ in my heart, but my customers are red in their dealings; I cannot vote for you, although my_ heart is with you,” I say it is forced on mo, if a man thinks one way and votes another, to say that tho right protection to give him is the ballot. (Cheers.) I have, however, never thought the ballot a panacea. I think the only panacea for the people is an extension of the area of voting. No man ever heard of a large constituency being bribed. The thing is impossible. Bribery only exists and is practicable in a small constituency. My hon. friend said something about the pace at which reform ought to go. Finality, like the old stage coach, has quite gone off fee load. Is it possible to talk of finality and man ? Is not the ■whole word subject to—X may say governed by change ? Finality is indeed at an end, and tho question now is, sot what i» the pace at which we are to go, but
who are to botte drivers of fee vehicle? (Cheers.) Devon tmnk those two gentlemen there can handle what are called the ribands ? (A laugh.) That my hon. opponent. Sir George Clerk, is to bo trusted on the box, or feat niy other hon. opponent is calculated for fee office of guard? (Laughter.) "Well, I should »y. If he (Mr. Hope) cannot give a clearer exposition of his sentiments than has been given by Sir George Clerk he is not to be trusted as either coachman or guard. (Laughter.) But, however that may be, you shall hear him blow his own hem (renewed laughter), and perhaps, before fee evening concludes, we shall know what these two gentlemen are. But how any set of gentlemen—how fee great Conservative party la this town who voted for and supported Lord Chelsea in 1852 jow support these two. gentlemen who call themselves the friends of progress, which means a jog-trot progress in a gig with a lame horse, passes my comprehension to elucidate, (i.Aughter.) Sir Georgo Cletk says he will give Ijord Palmerston no factions opposition* X think he is giving him a very factious opposition* He says he will support Lord Palmerston, but he has got a proviso— he will only support Lord Palmerston if he approves his measures. Of course, if he gets into Parliament he will not support them. He will support Lord Palmerston here, bat not if you send him to represent you in St. Stephens, Now, X wish him to be there, but not for this place. (A laugh.) I will allow he has been a most, honourable and useful member; but X don’t want to see him here. If it were anywhere else I must say I would support Sir George Clerk, provided he brought in measures which I liked, and provided, above all things, he told no jokes from “Joe Miller.” (Laughter.) This is a serious thing. What will these two gentlemen •xi „ “7, « they have done before: they will go with Mr. Gladstone; at least X suppose so. (“No.”) No? Whom, then, will they go with; on whioh’eide of the House w • I hardly think Sir George Clerk will go with Lord Derby, but there is no saying, (Alaugh.) Inl852 he made a most bitter attack on liord Derby. Ho denounced him in the strongest terms, saying ‘‘Look at these men (the Protectionists) ; think of their organized hypocrisy. They are going to the counties as Protectionists, and they come to the towns as Freetraders!” Why, what is Sir G. Clerk doing to-day? He comes here as a Palmerstonite; but what is he really t On what side of the House does he intend to sit? I toll you this— that Lord Palmerston, like other Ministers, is made of what is called saueezable materials. (Interruption.) There is a land friend of mine standing just below me here, whoso intelligent face I recognize, andwhosays, “Sir George Clerk wants to put the drag on for the sake of them Radicals.” We will pardon his grammar forth© sake of his truth. (Laughter.) Rut, my good friend, the drag is onlv put on while the vehicle is going down hill* (Renewed laughter and cheers.) The coach is not going down the hill with Palmerston on the box, but it may go down ifyou send such veryoddgentlemen to support him as the twoon the opposite side of the hustings. You may want the drag tnen; but if you will send to Parliament men who are for judicious and timely reforms, and who will make Palmerston bring in those reforms,. you will be doing right, and, what is more, you will be doing what is good for the country. Now, one word on this subject. It has been said on the other side that I am a wild and visionary reformer. Well, I don’t know exactly what that means ; but X know what a jog-trot reformer & I am no wild and visionary reformer. I think that before giving^ the people their rights you must instruct them in their duties. (Cheers.) X am not for giving votes to men who are not able to listen to reason. I am for the education of the people on an extended scale, A roan is not fit to be tiusted with the franchise unless he can discuss, and unless he can listen to discussion. But, you may ask, what kind of education ? I will tell you. There is a Bill before Parliament for a compulsory rate. I ^ am against any compulsory rate for purposes of education. (Cheers.) I wish education, to be voluntary, but supported by grants from the State, as at present. # Well, you will ask me, what about voting ? The suffrage is looked upon by many in different lights. Some look on it a right, others as a privilege, others as a trust, and I believe there are a few who look upon it as a perquisite. (Alaugh.) It is impossible in the state of society m which we live to remain stationary, I tell you feat I »m< prepared to support a judicious measure for extending fee suffrage, and I believe Lord Palmerston is prepared to do fee same. Mr. Osborne feen proceeded to state his opinions at some length as to church-rates, complaining of fee unsatisfactory state of fee law in that respect, fee Maynoofe grant, and High Church principles, the last of which, he said, led people almost inevitably to Borne. He continued—I think I have been pretty explicit as to my opinions. I am for no wild reform. 1 am not feat ardent and enthusiastic reformer which has been represented to yon. I am for doing what is practicable wife the existing materials. (Cheers.) Do the men who supported Lord Chelsea at fee last election, and now rapport my two honourable opponents, carry all their party wife them? No. I have met here really honest independent mon of the Conservative party—not jog-trots— nothop-and-go-ones, and they have said to me, “Mr. Osborne, we have not been great admirers of your conduct, but we respect your sincerity, and on this occasion we will give you our votes.” "Well, I am bound to receive all votes; “the smallest donations are thankfully received.” (Laughter.) I have had a considerable number of votes from men of feat class, and, without doing injury to my convictions, 1 shall try to prove myself worthy of their support. "With respect to Maynoofe, I still think that the nghfc measure would have been to take the sum given to that institution from the wealth of the established church in Ireland, which is not the church of the poor but of the rich, instead of levying it on the consolidated fund. Eat X will _ not vote for the repeal of that grant; nor will I vote with any party fbr putting a slur upon my Eomau Catholic fellow-countrymen. If you have any regard for your country leave reugious points to man and his Creator, and you will not endeavour to rob your Eoman Catholic countrymen of this paltry pittance “ Which not enriches yon, “ And leaves them poor indeed,” (Cheers.) I disdain to fight this contest on mere local grounds. (Cheers.) If X am worthy to ho returned to Parliament, send me there, or reject me, if yon like, in consideration of my public conduct and my public principles; but I, for one, will not condescend to peddle with you about a local matter. (Cheers.) X have given yon a full, fair, and X think candid exposition of my sentiments. If you are of opinion that I am fit to represent you and your interests in Parliament, I will do my brat to advance the public weal, and as far as possible to attend to your local affairs. I make no rash or excessive promises. X pledge myself to nothing whichl cannot perform. I do not tell you I will fill your lodginghouses or make year fortunes; but X will take care feat fee interests of Dover shall not suffer at my hands. If you think X have spoken out, X ask you for your votes, hut I ask for them in conjnnotion with another. I hope you will send a real supporter of Lord Palmerston along with me, and that you will not place yourselves in the position of being a sort of neutral borough, with one member voting on one side and another on the other, but that you will send my friend (Sir William Bussell) “fee British grenadier” (a langh) to take care of me in Parliament. (Laughter.) Ifyou do so you may not have men who will hide their principles in a rich wardrobe of words ; but yon will not find two men who will take a livelier interest in your local affairs, or who will more sincerely, more honestly, mote earnestly, or more ardently labour to advance the public weal than the two who now stand before yon. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Hope replied, in a spirited speech, to the address of Mr. Oshomeaud entered at some length into an exposition of his political principles which areidenticalwith those of Sir Georgo Clerk, his colleague in the contest. He added feat he stood there an independent man, hound tone master, answerable to no Minister, and asking the suffrages of the electors on public grounds alone. A show of hands was then taken, which the Mayor decided to bo in favour of Mr. Osborne and Sir W. Bussell; and a poll having been demanded on behalf of Sir G, Clerk and Mr. Hope, it will be taken this day (Saturday). Tho proceedings lasted nearly five hours. THE LEITH BURGHS. The nomination for the burghs of Leith, Portobello, and Musselburgh took place on Thursday, at 12 o’clock, on the hustings at Leith. Mr. Sheriff Gordon read Her Majesty’s writ. Mr. G. A. M’Laken then nominated the Eight Hon. James Monoreiff, Lord-Advocate of Scotland, who had represented these burghs for six years. Colonel Johxsxone, Provost of Portobello, seconded the nomination. Sir. Cassels, an aged ex-Magistrate, nominated Mr. William Miller, merchant, who was seconded by Mr. D. B. STGregor. The Lord-Advocate said feiswas the fourth occasion on which he had stood on those hustings to solicit fee suffrages of the electors of the Leith burghs. He would now ask them to bear in mind fee circumstances under which this election took place. Parliament had been dissolved by Her Majesty in order feat the country might give a clear response to the question whether it approved fee policy of Lord Palmerston. It was that question they were called upon to answer, and which they mnst answer to-morrow at the poll, not the little scraps of questions which had been introduced into this contest. He now asked for the suffrages of the Xoith electors, in the first place, because he was a member of Lord Palmerston’s Administration, and ho asked them to show their confidence in that noble Lord by returning a member of his Government. He had been objected to as a candidate lor these burghs because he did not approve the introduction of the English 40s. freeholds into Scotland, and had voted against Mr.Looke King’s motion. The freehold question was a new one to most of its present supporters, but it was not a new one to him. In 1852, before introducing his lieform Bill for Scotland, ho had studied feat question, and he considered it far better to introduce a general than such a partial and exceptional measure of reform. He had also voted against Mr. Locke King’s motion, because his opinion was, that without a general measure of reform, lowering the franchise here and lowering it there was not desirable. Mr. Miller having addressed fee electors, A show of hands was then taken, which the Sheriff declared to be in favour of Mr. Miller, A. poll was de manded by the Lord-Advocate.

Mr. Locke held meetings, yesterday at tbe St. George’s Tavern, Lambeth-road ; tho George, Gravel-lane; the Colonel Wardle, Tooley-streat; and the Brown Beat, Southwark-bndge-road. Sir C. Napier held two large meetings—one at the St. George s-haU, St. George’s road, and tho other at tho Leather-market Tavern, New Weston-street. The only new matter m Sir Chrries’s address related to fee alleged coalition between himself and Mr. Pellatt. He stated that having voted differently on the question which led to the dissolutmn, it wasimpossible that they should coalesce, and that he stood, therefore, entirely upon his own ground, not cinng whom else tho electors returned so lone as they chose him tor one. His version of the affair was tms:—A printer had contracted with him to deliver in person his cards to every voter for 20L The same man bad been employed by Mr. Pellatt to perform the like service for him, The printer—by whom instigated he (Sir Charles Napier) knew not—had enclosed both cards tied together like wedding cards, in one envelope, and had fens sent them forth. The moment that this came to his knowledge ho went himself to the printer, and brought away 1,500 of his cards from him; but still the pnnter had others, and he continued to sand them out in the “united state.” To obviate the falsa impression which it might create, he (Sir L. -Napier) had sent separately, by post, direct . e0wn Committee-room, about 11,000 now cards, and the consequence was that this marriage of the cards had cost him just 60 guineas. Ho knew not who was the author of this dirty electioneering trick, but ho was quite satisfied that it had been done to injure him. He acquitted Mr. Pellatt, however, of any knowledge of the transaction. Lithe evening Mr, Pellatt met a large and respsotahle body of the electors at the Bridge-house Hotel, "Wellingtonsrteet, when the chair was occupied by Mr. Vickers. In his address to the meeting, Mr. Pellatt expressed his readiness either te retire into the solaces of private life, or to renew his services to his country and the borough. It was for the men of bouthwark to say whether he had done his duty, and whether his labours had been fruitful and productive of benefit to his country; and, if they thought that he naa not failed in these respects, upon them would rest a responsibility for which they must account if they discharged a faithful servant to make room for astranger. While avowing himself to be perfectly indopendent of the Minister, he stated that there were in Lord ralmerston as powerful elements for the people’s good as “ere had been in Sir R, Peel; and that if they clothed Lord Palmerston with vigour, and gave him some 50 or 60 additional Liberal members, he would he enabled to cany beneficial measures of reform, which would insure him the popular support. He declared himself to be not a party man. but tho people’s man, stating that wherever there were wrongs to be redressed he was rer.dy to maintain fee cause even of the weakest, and that they would ever find in him an unpaid, zealous, and determined advocate, animated alone by feelings of truth, probity, and justice. On tbe motion of Mr. Newman, seconded by Mr. T. Pocock, and supported by Mr. J. P. GaSSIOT, theusual vote of confidence was passed to the Chairman, and the proceedings, which had been very enthusiastic throughout, were brought to a close. LAMBETH. The contest here will be severe, aud the result is doubtful. £ach of the three candidates seems to reckon with more or less of confidence upon standing at th© head of the poll. It is supposed, however, that the struggle will bo mainly between the retiring members, Mr. "Williams and Mr. Wilkinson, the new candidate, Mr. Boupell, who comes forward independent supporter of Lord Palmerston, being con* PrettJ ©lection. As music and party badges are forbidden theenergiesofjvrdentpartisansfindventthrougbthe muml press, which teems with posters and placards setting forth the merits or demerits of the rival candidates. In this ^7 the performances of the old members and the promises of the new aspirant to senatorial honours are freely commented upon. One of these effusions, maliciously dated from Mr. Williams’s own committee-room, calls upon the electors to vote for “ Wiscount” Williams, and refers them to the article on “ his lordship” reprinted from The Times of Thursday. There are upwards of 20,000 electors on the register, and _ this has rendered any regular canvass out of the Question; but the candidates have done wbat they could by nightly speeches in different parts of the borough to gain the favour of the constituency. Some bitterness of feeling seems to have arisen between tho two ex-members, Mr. Williams charging Mr. Wilkinson with oemg a thick-and-thin supporter of the Government, and Mr. Wilkinson retorting by allusions to his late colleague’s suppleness aud dexterous change of views upon one or*two questions considered of importance by the electors. The nomination takes place this morning at the Triangle, Kennington-cross, and the polling on Monday. IRELAND. Bandon Borough.—The election takes place on Tuesday, when the Hon. Captain Bernard (Derbyite) will walk over. Clark County.—A great meeting of county electors was held in Emus on Wednesday, to consider the claims of the batch of candidates now soliciting the suffrages of the constituency* The choice, it seems, fell upon Mr. Luke White, son of Colonel Henry White, and Mr. Macnamara Caicott, who has resigned the shrievalty in anticipation of the higher honour being conferred upon him. However, Lord Erancis Conyngham and the veteran Sir J. F. Fitzgerald have pledged themselves to go to the poll, the decision againsttheir claims notwithstanding. Cork City.—-The nomination takes place to-day, Mr. Hutchinson having fled the field, the late Liberal members, Messrs. Beamish and Fagan, will bo re-elected. Cork County.—A Cork Conservative journal of Thursday morning thus reports progress in the county -“The nomination takes place on Saturday week at 11 a.m. Tbe candidates at present in the field are Mr, R. Doasy, Q.C., and Mr, V. Scully, tho late members ; and Mr, A, McCarthy, Currymount. Up to last night, when wo received Mr. Scully s address, the first and last of these gentlemen were the only persons who had addressed the constituency through the public press. Mr. Scully, however, had been canvassing m the neighbourhood of the Muskeries, but it is said ^ with very little success, as the Sadleir iniquity had in almost every instance militated against him.. The election, however, docs not depend ou the exertions or qualifications of the several candidates so much as upon the feelings of the Romish clergy. The telegraph brings a sketch of a meeting held in Cork yesterday for the purpose of deciding upon the claims of the three candidates-namely, the late members, Messrs, Vincent Scully and Deasy, and Mr. Alexander M’Carthy. After Mr. Deasy and Mr. M’Carthy had addressed the assemblage amid applause which denoted that they were tbe men for the place, Mr. Scully came forward and said he was not going te address that meeting,as he perceived that he was already set aside, and ho did notthiukhe would submit te that meeting, but would take the sense of the county* He would take another opportunity of setting himself right with the county. He complained that he had not been called upon te speak in the proper order, as the senior representative of the county, and said he ought not now te be set aside because he had fallen into troubles which he was meeting like a man. If ho_ stood alone he would carry tho election, dospite all opposition. Mr. Luke Shea proposed Mr. Deasy* Mr. M’Carthy O’Leary proposed Mr. Alexander M’Carthy. Mr. Scully was not proposed. Mr* Deasy and Mr. M’Carthy were then unanimously adopted by the meeting, which separated with a vote of thanks to the chairman. Subsequently another meeting, composed of those who professed the independent opposition craze, was held at the Athenceum. Mr, M'Carthy Downing presided. A number of resolutions were passed, the principal one being to bind the meeting to support no candidate who wag not In tho independent Opposition. Mr. Shine Lawlor and Mr. J. F. Maguire were proposed as candidates. Mr. Maguire declined to stand, as he was bound to contest Duugarvan Tbe meeting unanimously adopted Mr. Lawlor. The meeting then separated. The four candidates Ml expressed their determination to go to the poll. Down County—One of the Belfust papers publishes fee following Statement“ An arrangement is likely to bo eome to by the friends of Mr. D. S. Ker and those of another gentleman whose name I am not at present at liberty to disclose, by which the Liberal interest in tho county of Down mil be consolidated in opposition to tho newly-formed million between HOI audT Forde, intended as the Utter manifestly is to restore the reign of monopoly »nd Toryism m few important county. The friends of Liberal and propessive government would do well to withhold their votes till something definite is concluded on.” DungarvaN.—-It is reported that at the eleventh hour * Conservative will be found hardy enough to dispute the representation of the borongh of Dungarvan with Mr. John Francis Meguire. Tbe report may be token for what it 13 worth. Another rumour, however, looks more alarm-

Conservative aspirant, finding that the odds were altogether against him has made ®,f necessity, and withdrawn from the contest, xoronce, therefore, Sir Denham Norreys will be returned unopposed for hi* own borough. Mat° (County).—The local papers slate that a coalition has been entered into between Colonel Palmer, the Conscr* Moore, tho pot of St. Jariath’s. The object is, of course, to thrust out Colonel 0'“?I,ery uiggms, who has fallen under the displeasure of Dr. M Halo. Wbskieatil—It appears that, acting upon fee advice of Mr. George H. Moore, opposition is to be given to tho return of Messrs. PoUerd-tJrqnhart andMagan. A stormy meeting was held in Mullingar on Thursday, when it wm resolved that Mr. John Ennis (the choice of Athlone) and Sir Richard Levmge, who has been nominated by Mr# Moore, were the most fit and proper persons to represent tho county.

The Chinese War
THE CHINESE WAS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—You may congratulate yourself on having rendered » permanent service to the country by your exposure of the abuses of the old system, or non-system, of conducting our military operations, which destroyed one army aud for a time imperilled the prestige of the British name. Dr. Gordon, the head of the medical department of tho Chinese expeditionary force, has received carle blanche to do what he likes and get what he wants for the health of the men, and he is already making arrangements for the accommodation of 40 per cent, of the strength of the troops. "What a contrast with Gallipoli! What a wiso and economic extravagance ! Mr. Power, fee Commissary-General of thi expedition, has received his instructions f romLoxd Panmure to fee same effect and in the same spirit“ Get what yon want. Do as yon like.” "With these powers there can ba no excuse for neglect of duty, except unfitness for the duty. Tho old Crimean pleas are put out of court, and with full authority conics direct responsibility. Had you not strengthened the hands of the Administration and the Executive with all the force of public opinion they would never have ventured on such a bold and liberal course, and we should have seen the memorable old routine of divided responsibility, blundering, jealousy, and apathy as active and mischievous in China as it was in the Crimea. The country will, at all events, be now enabled to detect incapacity and to reward merit. Your obedient servant, _ RUDE DONATU3.

Loss op a Clipper Ship.—We regret to record fee loss of the new iron clipper ship Charlemagne, of 1,017 tom, William Reid commander, and belonging to Messrs. Ctee, Skinner, and Co., and M’Arthur and Binnie’s line of Australian packets. This magnificent vessel left this port with a fair wind on Thursday last for Melbourne with a full and valuable cargo, and upwards of a dozen first-class passengers. The tug-steamer and pilot left her at Pladda about 11 p.m., and between 2 and 3 a.m. of Friday she went on shore during thick weather at Feoohan Bay, on the coast of Cantire, about six miles to the south of Campbelton, and at the entrance of tho Sound of Sanda, The crew and passengers were landed in the boats, and when the latter left tho vessel she was lying with 7 feet of water in her hold, and her deck towards the sea being apparently in a very perilous position. From tho effects of the easterly gales the Charlemagne was breaking up on Monday, while her cargo was washing out of the hold and being strewed along fee coast. No hopes can therefore be entertained of saving tho unfortunate vessel, which, along with her cargo, is said to be valued at 110,0001. Both are covered by insurance. She had several valuable horses on hoard, all of which were drowned.—Greenock Advertiser.

LONDON, SATURDAY, MARCH 2 1857.
The Emperor of China, it seems, agrees with the British Plenipotentiary and Her Majesty’s Government as to the conduct of Commissioner Yeh and the Cantonese7*i'iHis Celestial Majesty has sent orders to the intractable Viceroy to conciliate the British. This is no more than was to be expected, as the four other ports very early received notice that they were to go on as usual, and leave the quarrel to itself in the walls of Canton. For years past the utter insubordination of the populace at Canton, and, not less, the factious and mercenary use made of that insubordination by the local functionaries, have proved a great annoyance and weakness te the Court of Pekin,
■When the Emperor remonstrated with his Viceroy upon the non-observance of the Treaty of 1842, and the constant quarrels with the foreigners, the Viceroy for the time replied that it was not in his power to compel the people to observe the treaty, so great was their antipathy to the foreigners; though, at the very time he was doing his utmost to stimulate that antipathy to all manner of excesses. In point of fact, the savage and insolent temper of the Cantonese was the stock in trade of a host of officials, who could do as they pleased, levy export duties at discretion, and hold the province practically independent of Pekin, on the strength of the intractable character of the people. On the last occasion when this apology was made to the Court of Pekin it found the Emperor in a state of political and financial embarrassment, and all that His Majesty could do was to send back a brief and peevish reply that the Commissioner was to manage as well as he could. This was enough for the latter, and for some time past Canton has been in a state of virtual independence, not to say rebellion, against Pekin. However, the Emperor has now an auxiliary in the British force. He has sent the Viceroy orders which he would probably not have ventured to send, or thought it of any use to send, this time last year, to make up matters with the British. What Commissioner Yeh will do under these circumstances it would be vain to conjecture. He may possibly attempt to maintain his position by the aid of the rebels whom he has recently taken into confidence and pay. This is, indeed, his only chance, as otherwise he must soon submit to the Imperial orders, aided by the British arms, and in that case will lose at least his office, and very possibly mote. But our part of the affair is now very much simplified. Yeh becomes only the ringleader of a brutal mob, upon whom, with the concurrence of his Sovereign, we have to enforce respect for treaties, for laws, and for the rights of humanity. Bui, while conscience and law have been asserting their supremacy in the breast of a Tartar potentate, faction and selfishness have had their outbreak in a Christian community; and, by a singular coincidence, the number of this paper which gives the first column of a new Parliament, summoned on this very question, announces the fact that the question is happily settled on the other side of the world. Did the folly of the whole proceeding admit of any aggravation it is supplied by the fact that at the very time when the House of Commons was stigmatizing the proceedings of the British Plenipotentiary with violence and injustice those proceedings had been crowned with success, and sanctioned by an Imperial rebuke on the conduct which had provoked them. All that now remains is the question of damages, and the new arrangements necessary to prevent a recurrence of these outrages; but the quarrel itself may be said to be over. Some time in the course of May, when the British Plenipotentiary is quietly making out his bill for compensation,—rather a heavy one, of course,—and providing for our free and safe admission into the country, he will be astounded to hear that the British House of Commons had been amusing itself with a censure, not less futile than vexatious, on proceedings which will then be five months out of date, and justified by the timely submission of the barbaric offender. The British nation is doing its work so quickly that the character of the new Parliament will go out in the same mail with the dissolution of the last, and Orientals, whether Chinese or British, will hardly have time to speculate on the chances of Engine endorsing the criticism of Cobden, Gladstone, Russell, and Derby. The news will probably go out in its very motley and pictnresque aggregate, and all that Commissioner Yeh can infer from it will be that there are people ail over the world very like himself, that human nature is much the same under all climates, physiognomies, and attires, and that, as some Chinese poet has probably observed in his dwn language, “ A fellow feeling “ makes ns wondrous kind.” However, he will have his attention very powerfully drawn to the other side of the picture, to the triumph of justice and common sense in the appeal to the people. He will observe that a nation can be as decided and energetic in defence of law as the populace of a city against it; and he will duly estimate the difference between his own savage volley of proclamations, rewards, threats, and other rubbish addressed to the turbulent population of Canton, and the quiet appeal of a constitutional Sovereign to a free people. There is a simplicity in the fact which must commend itself even to the perverted understanding and the fixed ideas of a Chinese Viceroy; and we confidently anticipate that the verdict of the British people will have weight at Canton and Pekin as well as at Westminster. The same mail brings another and less agreeable illustration of the difficulties attending the management of affairs many thousand miles off. While with respect to China we are on the way to peace there, but still quarrelling here, with respect to Persia we have made peace here, hut are waging a bloody war out there. The Bombay cavalry could not leave without a trial of strength with the Persians, and the consequences have been what was confidently predicted in India. There is no finer cavalry in the world than that of our Indian army j and the Persians have received due notice of what they are. to expect if they should ever assist in an invasion of onr Indian frontier. As the terms of peace agreed to at Paris have yet to be ratified at the Court of Teheran, it may possibly prove a fortunate circumstance that His Majesty has this additional proof of the Power with which he has matched himself; a proof which he will not be able to explain' away so readily as Oriental potentates usually do their reverses. The strength of a Persian army lies in its cavalry, and this is the very arm which, according to the present news, has been found good for nothing in the presence of onr more disciplined squadrons. It is satisfactory to know that the collision must have been almost accidental, and that there is little chance of its repetition before the arrival of peaceful news. This Indo-Persian trial of arms will remain the closing scene of the war, and will doubtless leave a deep and lasting impression on the Persian mind. It is only by such impressions that these semi-barbarous peoples can be held in awe, and compelled to. respect the obligations of treaties and the independence of their neighbours. If, then, as some people persist in assuring ns, the Treaty itself is good for nothing, it is satisfactory to reflect that we have now expressed ourselves in a manner that is good for much, and which everybody can understand and appreciate for himself. It might have been wished that the above news had arrived a few days ago, before the commencement of the borough elections. It would have satisfied the British constituency that Lord Palmerston was not so very unreasonable in leaving the Chinese quarrel to take its own course, or rather that he had no choice but to do so. He might, it is true, have sacrificed the British Plenipotentiary—and, what is more, the British honour by regretting very vehemently the course taken by our authorities in the East, and regretting still more that he must follow up that course. This would have saved his own conscience, in the opinion of some fastidious people, without involving any change of policy, and the only sufferers would have been Sir John BowRfflq aad England, Lord Palmerston, howewr,
left that course, with all its merits and all its conveniences, to other statesmen better skilled in the art of combining the highest religious principles with the lowest worldly practice. He has entered with the mind of an enlightened Minister and a generous master into the difficulties of a confidential servant, and has not given np what he had no real reason to condemn, and must follow np. Had he made a virtue of surrendering Sir John Bowring to the particoloured scruples of three hostile factions, he would have found himself now in the comfortable and honourable predicament of not knowing ■ man and his cause so well as the Emperor of China appears to do, of having deserted fortune at the moment when it was smiling upon ns, and denied justice when even barbarians could no longer withhold it.
A Certain series of Hogarth's pictures represents the …
A certain series of Hogarth’s pictures represents the proceedings of an election in this country just 100 years ago; in fact, one of the plates bears the exact date of 1767; so that, making some allowance for caricature, we can inform ourselves of the manner in which our ancestors conducted those , very ceremonies on which so many constituencies will be engaged to-day. The picture of the polling represents a platform or stage something like the hustings of the present time, on which are seated two presiding dignitaries, and the phalanx of officials is further increased by two barristers in full legal costume, whose, services have been evidently engaged by the opposing candidates. The constituency, we must assume, has been polled almost to its dregs, for an idiot in the last stage of paralysis is giving his vote, and on the steps appears a dying man wrapped in a blanket, who, with a scroll of “ True Blue” attached to his nightcap, is carried to the place where his last suffrage may be recorded. A little further on a decidedly suspicious-looking character is taking the Bribery Oath, which he does by laying the stump of a wooden arm on the Gospels—an expedient which arouses the indignation of one of the lawyers and is vigorously defended by the other. None of these doings, however, attract much attention from a select knot of busybodies, whose interest is utterly absorbed in the perusal of someexceedingly piquant verses just issued, the purport and application whereof we readily conjecture from the frontispiece of an objectionable candidate suspended on a gibbet. For the rest of the series, everything is eating, drinking, guzzling, and squandering, with taverns thrown open and money flying in all directions. We can now well afford to smile at snob a picture ; but the truth is that there is no need to revert to 1757 for scenes pretty nearly analogous to those here burlesqued. It was not until the tune of the Reform Bill that the machinery of electioneering was radically changed, and many of those who record their votes this morning will be able to recollect a state of things offering a good many parallels to Hogarth’s description. Before 1832 county elections lasted a fortnight, and every elector had to go to the county town—sometimes at the very extremity of the shire—to record his vote. Borough elections lasted a week, the agony of candidates and the uproar of the town being protracted through seven days together, As to treating and spending, there was literally no limit to excess and scandal. A tough contest would cripple the means of a county family for years,—60,000J., 60,000?., or 100,000?. being sometimes called for. The expenditure upon favours, or ribands of the candidates’ colours, was something incredible, while every pothouse was expected to be opened either by one side or the other. At the polling-place the method of procedure was tardy and difficult. Doubtful votes had to be fought out on the spot before the assessor, so that the whole business of onr present Registration Courts was transacted at the very time 0f the election. When the polls were at length completed, as there were no railways and no electric telegraphs, the general results were ascertainable only after tedious intervals, andcc scrutinies” or inquiries into the character of the votes polled by this candidate or that were always in reserve to solace or avenge the disappointment of the defeated. The change from these practices is now something marvellous, A single day sees the beginning and end of the poll in each place, and a single day informs the whole country of the proceedings in every part of it. The suffrages given by the several constituencies on any one morning appear in our columns the next; and such is the expedition now attending a general election that the whole period elapsing between the vote of the House of Commons which occasioned the dissolution and the return of the members composing the new Parliament will hardly exceed acalendar month. On the. evening of Tuesday, the 3d of March, the resolutions on the Chinese question were carried against the Government, and by Tuesday, the 31st, the sense of the country will have been pretty well ascertained. Mr. Disraeli talked about wasting a year ; but, if the new Parliament bestirs itself, there certainly need be no such outlay of time set down to the cost of the elections. Parliament, in fact, was actually sitting this day last week, and yet by 4 o’clock this afternoon the polls for a great number of the boroughs will have been closed. Lord John Russell, in addressing the friends of the Golden-lane SchoolsonWednesday, took occasion to remark that, though the diffusion of political knowledge throughout the land was now looked upon as an ordinary kind of event, the religious instruction enjoyed by the inhabitants of the metropolis had made such little progress for the last 200 years that it was, in his belief, less in its amount at the present moment, in proportion to the number of the population, than it had been in 1657. Without entering just now into the question of religious knowledge, it is certain that political knowledge has made the strides to which his Lordship alluded ; and nothing, in our opinion, has tended more to this result than the purification of our electioneering proceedings. The very compression of time and the distribution of the polling-places must have been attended with prodigious effect, for, even if the disposition remained the same, there could no longer be the same opportunities for profligacy or corruption. It is, indeed, to the indirect operation of reforms like these that we look with the greatest confidence for the removal of evils still existing. The Ballot could certainly never prevent bribery so long as one man was disposed to sell and another to buy; but the machinery of corruption must be sadly dislocated by the summary proceedings of an election where a single day sees the whole voting, and a single week or fortnight, perhaps, the whole transaction, from the first bow of the candidate to the declaration of the. poll. One feature, indeed, seems already noticeable in the pending contest, and that is that money is likely to go for less than on any former occasion. If we could venture upon predicting any special characteristic of the suffrages which will be given in the next day or two, we should be inclined to say that the elements preponderating in the proceedings would be an absence of political organization and an excess of individual action, as compared with the features of former contests. In one sense, it is true, we observe the operation of organized bodies in rather a striking manner, for societies upon societies have been addressing the aggregate constituencies of the kingdom, with the.view of impressing upon the mind of the nation the peculiar objects or tenets they respec¬
tively profess. Protestant Associations and National Clubs shake the Maynooth question before the face of every man with a vote at his disposal j one Committee demands the total abolition of Churchrates, and another their continuance ; even the Bank Charter Act is put out as a shibboleth by which the claims of a candidate may be tested, and by one advertisement we are earnestly adjured to see that every competitor for our suffrages upholds Lord Palmerston’s policy in the prevention of smoke. Notwithstanding, however, these efforts at concentration, we believe that on the present occasion the electors will make np their own minds and come to conclusions for themselves with far greater independence than is usually exerted under such circumstances. Perhaps the gradual obliteration of political landmarks, and the partial fusion of parties in the . npport or censure of that particular act of Government which has been most prominently brought forward, may be conducive to this result, but we suspect hat a more deeply-seated influence remains behind. Men are no longer so easily led as formerly. The spread of political information must necessarily be followed by the formation of political character, tnd the purification of elections, by pure, or, in ither words, independent votes—votes given irre■ peotively not only of corruption but of influence too. Some vital question may, indeed, hereafter divide the constituencies of the kingdom after the ancient fashion, but for the next day or two we think private judgment is likely to tell with a good deal of weight; and, with the confidence which we place in the British character, we are certainly not disposed to augur ill from the fact.

Lord John Russell and the City Election
LORD JOHN RUSSELL AND THE CITY ELECTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,—As, from the arrangements made, I was, I believe, but imperfectly heard *t the Guildhall to-day when putting Mr. Crawford in nomination, I beg to submit to you the following explanation of what has taken place. I received on Monday morning, the 9th inst., by post, a. letter from Bord John Bussell, dated the 8th, saying that he had “ resolved to postpone any determination respecting the city election, for some days, at all events.” Within a few minutes afterwards Mr. John Abel Smith presented himself, and I showed him the letter. “Why,” he said, “here’s a letter from Lord John to a contrary effect !” That letter was dated a day earlier (the 7th), and stated another view of his Lordship’s intention, Mr. John Abel Smith, evidently astonished and somewhat confused, said, “ You had better give me back the letter I brought,” I declined to do so, thinking that a messenger, as one who was not the writer, but merely the bearer, delivering a sealed letter, had no right to *sk for it back. We were, I believe, both of us somewhat perplexed, and, to relieve that perplexity, I engaged not to show tho letter brought by Mr. Smith, Now, there are two charges which have been brought against me, both somewhat angrily and intemperately,—the first that, contrary to my promise, I have shown this letter; and, secondly, that I have improperly used or spoken of its contents, the allegation being that I have thereby injured Lord John’s prospect of being elected. Both charges are unfounded and untrue. In the first place, no one connected with the city of London, no member of a committee, no voter or person connected directly or indirectly with the city of London, has (even up to the present moment) seen that letter, or a transcript of it, or heard it read. , is said, secondly, that I have acted improperly m using or speaking of the receipt of the first letter declining to stand. That I must also deny; knowing, by the bye, of no reason why I shoidd not have spoken of its receipt—only I did not, or why Lord John Russell should have wished me to act otherwise. I attended as a member of the committee the preliminary meeting of March. 10, in which were discussed the names of the four Liberal candidates to be recommended (as on former occasions) to the constituency. Itook tbeopportunity of saying that for myself as an individual I could not vote for Lord JohnRussell, and that I had written to him to say so ; but I cautiously and intentionally avoided speaking of his letters to me (both Ms letters), and carefully evaded a question then put to me on the subject. The general meeting, a large one, I did not attend, one of my chief reasons for not going into the larger room being that I wished as a matter of delicacy to avoid inquiry as to the intentions of Lord John Bussell. That meeting settled the question of the candidates to be recommended. It decided that they ought to be four mercantile men, not referring at all to Lord JohnRussell, who, I understand, was spoken of as quarrelling with his brother, or his brother with Him, about the Cobden vote, Lord John being, moreover, spoken of as a candidate for Middlesex. The candidates recommended were Rothschild, Duke, Crawford, and Currie. Now up to and after that meeting, which adopted four Liberal mercantile candidates, I not only had not shoion the letter, but I had not spoken to mortal man of its receipt or existence. Two days afterwards (I am told on inquiring it was on the 12th) Mr. W. J. Hall, at a meeting of the election committee, asked me publicly if I had not received such a letter. What was I to say ? I answered, reluctantly enough, but truly, that I had received, in fact, two letters from Lora J ohn Russell (describing briefly their general contents), but added that the last letter, which said he should take some days to consider whether or not he should stand, must betaken as his decision. This question, however, thus put to me cast a flood of light upon the subject, fori found, upon inquiry, that I had been carefully and conscientiously guarding a secret which everybody knew. Now, what induced Mr. Hall publicly to put that question to me? I now find (which I then did not know) that Mr. John Abel Smith, before delivering the letter in question to me, had said to more than one party, “Lord John will not stand; I have a letter in my pocket from him to Mr. Dillon saying so.” This had become known in the committee-room, and hence, T understand, Mr. Hall’s inquiry of me as to that letter. Secrets touching the contest are, 1 fear, seldom well kept in committee-rooms. The information, therefore, that Lord John Russell had written such a letter came not from me, but in fact from Mmself, by his agent, Mr. John Abel Smith. It was reported—I am sure falsely, because he now denies it—that Lord John Russell had asserted at the London Tavern that he had never said he would retire. One newspaper has broadly asserted that he has never so said. Lord John Russell himself does not deny it, and I do not see why he should do so, as it is clearly a subject on which he might, without discredit or dishonour, change Lin views and intentions. Yours respectfully, _ JOHN DILLON. Fore-street, March 27. P.S. I enclose two letters confirmatory of the above.

Report on Scotch Prisons.—The 22d Rep< of the Prison Inspectors of Great Britain is exclusivelyvoted to Scotland. The separate reports show thatthe prisi of Scotland generally, no less than thoseof the borderEngl counties annexed to the district, are in good order and nm excellent management: tho only marked exception bei the borongh gaol of Newcastle-on-Tyne, which is in respect improved.

The ■ perience of some years shows that crank labour, under ju cions rules, maybe worked with perfect safety, and 1 inspector holds it to be the most productive labour to whi a convicted prisoner can be subjected, as being that whi will prevent him, on his release, resuming his old emph ments. The nseof the “ guard bed,” too, is found to hav most deterring effect, without in the slightest degree injuri the prisoners’ health; and many of the governors of Soot prisons are anxious to have the use of the bed extend from one to two months after conviction, in the belief tl nothing is so likely to induce a thief to consider the p priety of resuming an honest life as an extended use of sn beds._ It is thought that the deterring system as carried < in this district might be extended with advantage to i public, and ultimate benefit to tho criminal.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. M
[The following appeared in our, second edition of yes terday:—] ’ FRAU. OB. - (JROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT,) . . BARIS, March 26, 6 p.ji. The Swiss Plenipotentiary gent by telegraph to his Government yest erday an account of what passed at the Conference, The same reserve is supposed to be maintained no w as when the Congress was sitting on the more important question of the Russian war. The account given in the Belgian papers of the deliberations of the meeting and the propositions are not to be received implicitly, if indeed any interest is felt about them in England. Further instructions from Berlin are said to be expected by M. de Hatzfeldt, who has exhibited more moderation than before, so far as words can be trusted. One can hardly say “definitive instructions,” for it is probably not in the nature of the King to be definitive in anything. Of His Majesty’s talents and accomplishments no one doubts,- and one can only explain his indecision in the same way that the admirers of the renowned Wouter van Twiller, first magistrate of Manhattan, accounted for the same quality in their master, namely, “that he always conceived every subject on so comprehensive a scale that he had not room in his head to turn it over and examine both sides of it, so that he always remained in doubt merely in consequence of the astonishing magnitude of his ideas.” There is another feature in the present negotiatibns which tends to create delayand toincrease the difficulty. M. de Hatzfeldt always objected to any parley with Dr. Kem, except in presence of the Plenipotentiaries in Conference assembled. This objection is attributable to the original indiscretions of the Swiss negotiator; but, whatever be the cause, these Ministers have had no conversation together, and they only meet round the Council table. The business gone through yesterday was rather summary. I)r. Kem was admitted, and M. Walewski, as President, read for him the minutes of the previous sitting, comprising the propositions of M. de Hatzfeldt. When they were read Dr. Kem said he should take them into consideration, and, when he had done so sufficiently, give his answer. M. Walewski remarked that a few days would be given, and that on Saturday next ’ the Plenipotentiaries would expect to receive from him an answer, in the negative or affirmative; but at all events an answer. The meeting then adjourned to Saturday. In some quarters the suspension of diplomatic relations between Austria and Piedmont is looked upon as rather serious, not so much as regards any immediate consequences, as on account of the complications to which it may give rise hereafter inltaly. It is rumoured, though I cannot say what grounds exist for the rumour, that it is in contemplation to suspend the reduction in the French army. The mode, however, of that reduction is such that the Emperor may again call the men back to the ranks without difficulty. Those who had returned to their homes on leave of absence, and whose period of service expires this year, were informed that they might remain at home; while those who have not obtained leave of absence were told that they might obtain leave by applying for it, and that such leave would be extended from time to time. Again, it is stated that the Austrian officers on leave in Paris have received notice that they are to join their respective regiments forthwith. The coincidence of this notice with the rupture between Austria and Piedmont does not pass unobserved. The French Minister at Washington had a lonoconference with the President of the United States^ immediately after his installation, and, it is said, received an assurance of the very conciliatory policy which the American Government meant to pursue. The Code Napoleon is in course of translation into the Turkish language. It is done with a view to assist the commission appointed by the Sultan to examine and report on the reforms which it is possible to introduce into the laws of the empire. The Monifewr de I'Armee announces that in consequence of the East India Company, through the intervention of the British Government, having ceded to the Emperor of the French the house occu^ pied by the first Napoleon at St. Helena, and the tomb in which his mortal remains were deposited until the year 1840, the house is immediately to be repaired. The tomb is to be restored to the state it was in when it contained the remains of the great man, and probably a funereal chapel will be added. All the places, in fact, which have been immortalized by his presence will be carefully guarded—the hill from which, in fine weather, he contemplated the sea, and the point of the road at which he returned when riding on horseback. The reception of M. de Falloux at the Academy io-day, to fill the place of the late Count Mole, attracted a more than usual concourse of visitors. It was previously known that M. de Falloux’s speech had, at the request of the Council of the Academy, been considerably modified. The political world was moreover curious to see how the former Minister of the President of the Republic would reconcile his new position with his former opinions. Neither was it an easy task for M. de Fallons to deliver an eulogium on Count MoM, his predecessor. It was recollected that the political career of the illustrious deceased was not always consistent. Count Mole, who was Minister under Napoleon I. and under Louis XYIIL, conducted in the Chamber cf Peers a strong opposition against the Government ofthe Restoration. Count Mole was subsequently Prime Minister under Louis Philippe. He became an ardent fusionist after a visit to Count de Chambord at Frohsdorfij and so continued to his death. M. de Falloux acquitted himself of his difficult task with great skill. His flexible talent and supple tongue carried him through, and his discourse was vehemently applauded, particularly the passage referring to the year 1830. He concluded amidst three rounds of applause. A letter from St. Petersburg, of the 16th, in the CoiistUutionnd, says ;— , “ The passage of the Neva on the ice is forbidden to carnages, in consequence of a troiska having disappeared under the ice between St. Petersburg and Peterhofc The thaw nad set in with considerable intensity, and the streets of the capital were full of rapid streams, impassable for foot passengers. Two days ago Count de Momy, while indulging in a ride down a Montague Bmsc, sustained a fall, which resulted in some contusions, which have forced the Count to remain at home.” TheNord, of Brussels, announces that the demands for shares at St. Petersburg from France are so numerous, that there will be no subscription lists opened at Paris. The Naval Tribunal of Toulon has just been occupied for two days in trying three marines for robbing the dockyard, and a workman for receiving their booty. The three men, it appeared, for some time bad been in the habit of pilfering petty objects, and especially pieces of copper, and of selling them to the workman. At length, the latter suggested to them that they Would do well to steal 'a considerable quantity, which was temporarily deposited in one of the cabins of the Massena ship of the line, undergoing repair. The three men accordingly made arrangements with their comrades to allow them to be on duty together as sentinels near that vessel on the night of the 16th of January last, and they then broke into the cabin, and, abstracting the copper, threw part of it over the outer wall to the workman, who was waiting to receive it, and they placed another part on the roof of a building until daybreak, when they let it down to him by cords. The next morning the robbery was discovered; and, as the button of a marine soldier was found near the cabin, it was suspected that it had been perpetrated by the marines on duty, and this suspicion was confirmed by marks in the ground near the sentryboxes and walk The men were arrested, and after a time made avowals. The tribunal condemned the workman to ten years’ hard labour, and the three marines to six years’ hard labour each, and to military degradation.

MONEY-MARKET and CITY INTELLIGENCE.
t Friday Evening, The English funds opened this morning; with a firm appearance at the steady quotations of yesterday s and. after a temporary relapse again recovered. Consols for money were first quoted 9S| to i, but touched 93£ upon several sales of stock for delivery, amounting in the aggregate to 130,0001. A considerable purchase for the May account then, caused a rally, and the latest transactions were at 93J to A for money, and 93£ to % for the 8th of April. For the new account on the 7th of May the last price was 94 to |. Bank Stock closed at 220 to 222 with dividend India Stock, 222 to 224 ; Exchequerbonds, 98J to ^ ; India Bonds, 6s. discount to par ; and Exchequer-bills (March), par to 3s. premium. In the Stock-Exchange to-day, owing to the sales of stock for money, advances on Government securities were in great demand at 6 per cent. There was much activity in the discount-market, while at the Bank of England, in consequence of the sums absorbed, there on account of the revenue at the termination of the quarter, the applications were excessively heavy and numerous. Foreign securities exhibited firmness, although the amount of business was limited. Turkish Six per Cents., for money, were Negotiated at 98| and h and for the account at 98£, f, and £. was heavy, the transactions for money being at 224 and for the account 22g, X, and |. The general operations comprised—Buenos Ayres, for account, 86f and 85; New Granada Active, 22i ' wtugnese Three per Cents., 44f; Sardinian Bivouac Cents., 90} ; Spanish- Three per Cents., for the account, 41| and J; the New Deferred, 25 and 261; Passive, 5|; Certificates of Coupon not funded, U and £ per cent. ; Venezuela, 37 ; and the Deferred, 14$. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates of last post were fully maintained. The corn-market this morning exhibited increased dulness, and sales could not have been pressed except at a further, decline. ... The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a moderate business at steady prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 30c. for money and 70f, 60c. for the end of the month, showing in the former case a fractional improvement. The commercial letters from the continent are uninteresting, the markets generally remaining without animation. ..At Hamburg the rate of discount has again advanced to 6£ per cent. At Paris the question of the International Bank was expected to come before the Council of State today. Subjoined is a general abstract of the shipping returns of the Board of Trade for the past month. They show a considerable increase in the clearances outward over the ' month of’February last year, although the total on that occasion was extremely large:— Entered inward— .

ETTS’s PATENT BRANDY has, ever" since its introduction to the public, been recognized.both by scientific men and the trade, as the best article ever manufactured in this country. Its claims to such pre-eminence ore basbd upon its unrivalled purity, •■•Ed ita closer assimilation than any other to the flavour of the finest Champagne brandy. There has been no brandy made from wine being distilled into brandy; and forasmuch as the foreign brandy of recent importations is but the product nf British grain and beetroot spirits, the prestige hitherto exclusively enjoyed by French brandy as having been distilled from a particular French wine no longer exists, and is no longer worthily assignable to it now that & i?„buDghnfly made from other materials. The supply of wine for distillation mto brandy having failed, the French distiller Is constrained to recur to a manufacture in which he needs the quarter of a century’s experience which has been exercised upon that of Betts’s patent brandy to render his article respectably competitive, and be has not had it. Under these circumstances, the Messrs. Betts challenge that their patent brandy Vs superior to any now made abroad. It Jg to the interest of the public and the Messrs. Betts that the?© facts should ho widely spread, for recent importations are of a quality an »f erior as to disgrace the name they bear, and are twice the price of Beta’s patent brandy, iwhicb is supplied [by the trade in capsuled bottles to private families, m any quantity, down to the single bottld.
